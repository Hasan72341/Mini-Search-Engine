{"id": "49644", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49644", "title": "Jean Sibelius", "text": "Finnish composer (1865\u20131957)\nJean Sibelius (; ; born Johan Julius Christian Sibelius; 8 December 1865\u00a0\u2013 20 September 1957) was a Finnish composer of the late Romantic and early modern periods. He is widely regarded as his country's greatest composer, and his music is often credited with having helped Finland develop a stronger national identity when the country was struggling from several attempts at Russification in the late 19th century.\nThe core of his oeuvre is his set of seven symphonies, which, like his other major works, are regularly performed and recorded in Finland and countries around the world. His other best-known compositions are \"Finlandia\", the \"Karelia Suite\", \"Valse triste\", the Violin Concerto, the choral symphony \"Kullervo\", and \"The Swan of Tuonela\" (from the \"Lemmink\u00e4inen Suite\"). His other works include pieces inspired by nature, Nordic mythology, and the Finnish national epic, the \"Kalevala;\" over a hundred songs for voice and piano; incidental music for numerous plays; the one-act opera \"The Maiden in the Tower\"; chamber music, piano music, Masonic ritual music, and 21 publications of choral music.\nSibelius composed prolifically until the mid-1920s, but after completing his Seventh Symphony (1924), the incidental music for \"The Tempest\" (1926), and the tone poem \"Tapiola\" (1926), he stopped producing major works in his last 30 years\u2014a retirement commonly referred to as the \"silence of J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4\" (the location of his home). Although he is reputed to have stopped composing, he attempted to continue writing, including abortive efforts on an eighth symphony. In later life, he wrote Masonic music and re-edited some earlier works, while retaining an active but not always favourable interest in new developments in music. Although his early retirement has perplexed scholars, Sibelius was clear about its cause \u2014 he simply felt he had written enough.\nThe Finnish 100 mark note featured his image until 2002, when the euro was adopted. Since 2011, Finland has celebrated a flag flying day on 8 December, the composer's birthday, also known as the Day of Finnish Music. In 2015, in celebration of the 150th anniversary of Sibelius's birth, a number of special concerts and events were held, especially in Helsinki, the Finnish capital.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nSibelius was born on 8 December 1865 in H\u00e4meenlinna () in the Grand Duchy of Finland, an autonomous state within the Russian Empire. He was the son of the Swedish-speaking medical doctor Christian Gustaf Sibelius and Maria Charlotta Sibelius (n\u00e9e Borg). The family name stems from the Sibbe estate in Eastern Uusimaa, which his paternal great-grandfather owned. Sibelius's father died of typhoid in July 1868, leaving substantial debts. As a result, his mother\u2014who was again pregnant\u2014had to sell their property and move the family into the home of Katarina Borg, her widowed mother, who also lived in H\u00e4meenlinna. Sibelius was therefore brought up in a decidedly female environment, the only male influence coming from his uncle, Pehr Ferdinand Sibelius, who was interested in music, especially the violin. Pehr Ferdinand gave the boy a violin when he was ten years old and later encouraged him to maintain his interest in composition. For Sibelius, Uncle Pehr not only took the place of a father but acted as a musical adviser.\nFrom an early age, Sibelius showed a strong interest in nature, frequently walking around the countryside when the family moved to Loviisa on the coast for the summer months. In his own words: \"For me, Loviisa represented sun and happiness. H\u00e4meenlinna was where I went to school; Loviisa was freedom.\" In H\u00e4meenlinna, when he was seven, Sibelius's aunt Julia was brought in to give him piano lessons on the family's upright instrument, rapping him on the knuckles whenever he played a wrong note. He progressed by improvising on his own, but still learned to read music. He later turned to the violin, which he preferred. He participated in trios with his elder sister Linda on piano, and his younger brother Christian on the cello. (Christian Sibelius was to become a psychiatrist, still remembered for his contributions to modern psychiatry in Finland.) Sibelius soon began playing in quartets with neighbouring families, furthering his experience performing chamber music. Fragments survive of his early compositions of the period, a trio, a piano quartet and a \"Suite in D Minor\" for violin and piano. Around 1881, he transcribed a short pizzicato piece \"Vattendroppar\" (Water Drops) for violin, possibly as an etude or musical exercise. The first reference he made to himself composing is in a letter from August 1883 in which he writes that he composed a trio and was working on another: \"They are rather poor, but it is nice to have something to do on rainy days.\" In 1881, he began violin lessons with the local bandmaster, Gustaf Levander, immediately developing a particularly strong interest in the instrument. Setting his heart on a career as a great violin virtuoso, he soon became an accomplished player, performing David's Concerto in E minor in 1886 and, the following year, the last two movements of Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in Helsinki. Despite such success as an instrumentalist, he ultimately chose to become a composer.\nIn 1874, Sibelius attended Lucina Hagman's Finnish-speaking preparatory school as a native Swedish speaker. In 1876, he continued his education at the Finnish-language H\u00e4meenlinna Normal Lyceum where he was a rather absent-minded pupil, though did quite well in mathematics and botany. Despite having to repeat a year, he passed the school's final examination in 1885, which allowed him to enter a university. As a boy he was known as Janne, a colloquial form of Johan. However, during his student years, he adopted the French form Jean, inspired by the business card of his deceased seafaring uncle. Thereafter he became known as Jean Sibelius.\nStudies and early career.\nAfter graduating from high school in 1885, Sibelius began to study law at the Imperial Alexander University in Finland but, showing far more interest in music, soon moved to the Helsinki Music Institute (now the Sibelius Academy) where he studied from 1885 to 1889.\nOne of his teachers was its founder, Martin Wegelius, who did much to support the development of education in Finland. Wegelius gave the self-taught Sibelius his first formal lessons in composition. Another important influence was his teacher Ferruccio Busoni, a pianist-composer with whom he enjoyed a lifelong friendship. His close circle of friends included the pianist and writer Adolf Paul and the conductor-to-be Armas J\u00e4rnefelt (who introduced him to his influential family, including his sister Aino who Sibelius would marry in 1892). The most remarkable of his works during this period was the Violin Sonata in F, rather reminiscent of Grieg.\nSibelius continued his studies in Berlin (from 1889 to 1890) with Albert Becker, and in Vienna (from 1890 to 1891) with Robert Fuchs and Hungarian-Jewish composer Karl Goldmark. In Berlin, he had the opportunity to widen his musical experience by going to a variety of concerts and operas, including the premiere of Richard Strauss's \"Don Juan\". He also heard the Finnish composer Robert Kajanus conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in a program that included his symphonic poem \"Aino\", a patriotic piece that may have inspired Sibelius's later interest in using the epic poem \"Kalevala\" as a basis for his own compositions. While in Vienna, he became particularly interested in the music of Anton Bruckner whom he regarded as \"the greatest living composer\" for a time, although also showing interest in the established works of Beethoven and Wagner. He enjoyed his year in Vienna, frequently partying and gambling with his new friends. It was also in Vienna that he turned to orchestral composition, composing an Overture in E major and a \"Sc\u00e8ne de Ballet\". While embarking on \"Kullervo\", an orchestral work with chorus and soloists inspired by the \"Kalevala\", he fell ill but was restored to good health after gallstone-excision surgery. Shortly after returning to Helsinki, Sibelius conducted his Overture and the \"Sc\u00e8ne de Ballet\" at a popular concert. He was also able to continue working on \"Kullervo\", now that he was increasingly developing an interest in all things Finnish. Premiered in Helsinki on 28 April 1892, the work was an enormous success.\nIt was around this time that Sibelius finally abandoned his cherished aspirations as a violinist:\nMy tragedy was that I wanted to be a celebrated violinist at any price. Since the age of 15 I played my violin practically from morning to night. I hated pen and ink\u2014unfortunately I preferred an elegant violin bow. My love for the violin lasted quite long and it was a very painful awakening when I had to admit that I had begun my training for the exacting career of a virtuoso too late.\nIn addition to the long periods he spent studying in Vienna and Berlin, in 1900 he travelled to Italy, where he spent a year with his family. He composed, conducted and socialized actively in the Scandinavian countries, Britain, France and Germany and later travelled to the United States.\nMarriage and rise to fame.\nWhile Sibelius was studying music in Helsinki in the autumn of 1888, Armas J\u00e4rnefelt, a friend from the Music Institute, invited him to the family home. There he met and immediately fell in love with Aino, the 17-year-old daughter of General Alexander J\u00e4rnefelt, the governor of Vaasa, and Elisabeth Clodt von J\u00fcrgensburg, a Baltic aristocrat. The wedding was held on 10 June 1892 at Maxmo. They spent their honeymoon in Karelia, the home of the \"Kalevala\". It served as an inspiration for Sibelius's tone poem \"En saga\", the Lemmink\u00e4inen legends and the \"Karelia Suite\".\nTheir home, Ainola, was completed near Lake Tuusula, J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4, in 1904. During the years at Ainola, they had six daughters: Eva, Ruth, Kirsti (who died aged one from typhoid), Katarina, Margareta and Heidi. Eva married an industrial heir, Arvi Paloheimo, and later became the CEO of the Paloheimo Corporation. Ruth Snellman was a prominent actress, Katarina Ilves married a banker and Heidi Blomstedt was a designer, wife of architect Aulis Blomstedt. Margareta married conductor Jussi Jalas, Aulis Blomstedt's brother.\nIn 1892, \"Kullervo\" inaugurated Sibelius's focus on orchestral music. It was described by the composer Aksel T\u00f6rnudd as \"a volcanic eruption\" while Juho Ranta who sang in the choir stated, \"It was \"Finnish\" music.\" At the end of that year the composer's grandmother, Katarina Borg died. Sibelius went to her funeral, visiting his H\u00e4meenlinna home one last time before the house was sold. On 16 February 1893, the first (extended) version of \"En saga\" was presented in Helsinki although it was not too well received, the critics suggesting that superfluous sections should be eliminated (as they were in Sibelius's 1902 version). Even less successful were three more performances of \"Kullervo\" in March, which one critic found incomprehensible and lacking in vitality. Following the birth of Sibelius's first child Eva, in April the premiere of his choral work \"V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen's Boat Ride\" was a considerable success, receiving the support of the press.\nOn 13 November 1893, the full version of \"Karelia\" was premiered at a student association gala at the Seurahuone in Viipuri with the collaboration of the artist Axel Gall\u00e9n and the sculptor Emil Wikstr\u00f6m who had been brought in to design the stage sets. While the first performance was difficult to appreciate over the background noise of the talkative audience, a second performance on 18 November was more successful. Furthermore, on the 19th and 23rd Sibelius presented an extended suite of the work in Helsinki, conducting the orchestra of the Philharmonic Society. Sibelius's music was increasingly presented in Helsinki's concert halls. In the 1894\u201395 season, works such as \"En saga\", \"Karelia\" and \"V\u00e5rs\u00e5ng\" (composed in 1894) were included in at least 16 concerts in the capital, not to mention those in Turku. When performed in a revised version on 17 April 1895, the composer Oskar Merikanto welcomed \"V\u00e5rs\u00e5ng\" (Spring Song) as \"the fairest flower among Sibelius's orchestral pieces\".\nFor a considerable period, Sibelius worked on an opera, \"Veneen luominen\" (The Building of the Boat), again based on the \"Kalevala\". To some extent, he had come under the influence of Wagner, but subsequently turned to Liszt's tone poems as a source of compositional inspiration. Adapted from material for the opera, which he never completed, his \"Lemmink\u00e4inen Suite\" consisted of four legends in the form of tone poems. They were premiered in Helsinki on 13 April 1896 to a full house. In contrast to Merikanto's enthusiasm for the Finnish quality of the work, the critic Karl Flodin found the cor anglais solo in \"The Swan of Tuonela\" \"stupendously long and boring\", although he considered the first legend, \"Lemmink\u00e4inen and the Maidens of the Island\", as representing the peak of Sibelius's achievement to date.\nTo pay his way, from 1892 Sibelius had taken on teaching assignments at the Music Institute and at Kajanus's conducting school but this left him insufficient time for composing. The situation improved considerably when in 1898 he was awarded a substantial annual grant, initially for ten years and later extended for life. He was able to complete the music for Adolf Paul's play \"King Christian II\". Performed on 24 February 1898, its catchy tunes appealed to the public. The scores of four popular pieces from the play were published in Germany and sold well in Finland. When the orchestral suite was successfully performed in Helsinki in November 1898, Sibelius commented: \"The music sounded excellent and the tempi seem to be right. I think this is the first time that I have managed to make something complete.\" The work was also performed in Stockholm and Leipzig.\nIn January 1899, Sibelius embarked on his First Symphony at a time when his patriotic feelings were being enhanced by the Russian emperor Nicholas II's attempt to restrict the powers of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The symphony was well received when it was premiered in Helsinki on 26 April 1899. But the program also premiered the even more compelling, blatantly patriotic \"Song of the Athenians\" for boys' and men's choirs. The song immediately brought Sibelius the status of a national hero. Another patriotic work followed on 4 November in the form of eight tableaux depicting episodes from Finnish history known as the \"Press Celebration Music\" (sometimes \"Days of the Press\"; subsequently reworked as \"Sc\u00e8nes historiques I\"). It had been written in support of the staff of the \"P\u00e4iv\u00e4lehti\" newspaper, which had been suspended for a period after editorially criticizing Russian rule. The last tableau, \"Finland Awakens\", was particularly popular; after minor revisions, it became the well-known \"Finlandia\".\nIn February 1900, Sibelius's youngest daughter, Kirsti, died. Nevertheless, in the summer Sibelius went on an international tour with Kajanus and his orchestra, presenting his recent works (including a revised version of his First Symphony) in thirteen cities including Stockholm, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Berlin and Paris. The critics were highly favorable, bringing the composer international recognition with their enthusiastic reports in the \"Berliner B\u00f6rsen-Courier\", the \"Berliner Fremdenblatt\" and the \"Berliner Lokal Anzeiger\".\nDuring a trip with his family to Rapallo, Italy, in 1901, Sibelius began to write his Second Symphony, partly inspired by the fate of Don Juan in Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\". It was completed in early 1902 with its premiere in Helsinki on 8 March. The work was received with tremendous enthusiasm by the Finns. Merikanto felt it exceeded \"even the boldest expectations,\" while Evert Katila qualified it as \"an absolute masterpiece\". Flodin, too, wrote of a symphonic composition \"the likes of which we have never had occasion to listen to before\".\nSibelius spent the summer in Tv\u00e4rminne near Hanko, where he worked on the song \"Var det en dr\u00f6m\" (Was it a Dream) as well as on a new version of \"En saga\". When it was performed in Berlin with the Berlin Philharmonic in November 1902, it served to firmly establish the composer's reputation in Germany, leading shortly afterwards to the publication of his First Symphony.\nIn 1903, Sibelius spent much of his time in Helsinki where he indulged excessively in wining and dining, running up considerable bills in the restaurants. But he continued to compose, one of his major successes being \"Valse triste\", one of six pieces of incidental music he composed for his brother-in-law Arvid J\u00e4rnefelt's play \"Kuolema\" (Death). Short of money, he sold the piece at a low price but it quickly gained considerable popularity not only in Finland but internationally. During his long stays in Helsinki, Sibelius's wife Aino frequently wrote to him, imploring him to return home but to no avail. Even after their fourth daughter, Katarina, was born, he continued to work away from home. Early in 1904, he finished his Violin Concerto but its first public performance on 8 February was not a success. It led to a revised, condensed version that was performed in Berlin the following year.\nMove to Ainola.\nIn November 1903, Sibelius began to build his new home Ainola (Aino's Place) near Lake Tuusula some 45\u00a0km (30 miles) north of Helsinki. To cover the construction costs, he gave concerts in Helsinki, Turku and Vaasa in early 1904 as well as in Tallinn, Estonia, and in Latvia during the summer. The family were finally able to move into the new property on 24 September 1904, making friends with the local artistic community, including the painters Eero J\u00e4rnefelt and Pekka Halonen and the novelist Juhani Aho.\nIn January 1905, Sibelius returned to Berlin where he conducted his Second Symphony. While the concert itself was successful, it received mixed reviews, some very positive while those in the \"Allgemeine Zeitung\" and the \"Berliner Tageblatt\" were less enthusiastic. Back in Finland, he rewrote the increasingly popular \"Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande\" as an orchestral suite. In November, visiting Britain for the first time, he went to Liverpool where he met Henry Wood. On 2 December, he conducted the First Symphony and \"Finlandia\", writing to Aino that the concert had been a great success and widely acclaimed.\nIn 1906, after a short, rather uneventful stay in Paris at the beginning of the year, Sibelius spent several months composing at Ainola, his major work of the period being \"Pohjola's Daughter\", yet another piece based on the \"Kalevala\". Later in the year he composed incidental music for \"Belshazzar's Feast\", also adapting it as an orchestral suite. He ended the year conducting a series of concerts, the most successful being the first public performance of \"Pohjola's Daughter\" at the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg.\nUps and downs.\nFrom the beginning of 1907, Sibelius again indulged in excessive wining and dining in Helsinki, spending exorbitant amounts on champagne and lobster. His lifestyle had a disastrous effect on the health of Aino who was driven to retire to a sanatorium, suffering from exhaustion. While she was away, Sibelius resolved to give up drinking, concentrating instead on composing his Third Symphony. He completed the work for a performance in Helsinki on 25 September. Although its more classical approach surprised the audience, Flodin commented that it was \"internally new and revolutionary\".\nShortly afterwards Sibelius met Austro-Bohemian composer Gustav Mahler who was in Helsinki. The two agreed that with each new symphony, they lost those who had been attracted to their earlier works. This was demonstrated above all in St Petersburg where the Third Symphony was performed in November 1907 to dismissive reviews. Its reception in Moscow was rather more positive.\nIn 1907, Sibelius underwent a serious operation for suspected throat cancer. Early in 1908, he had to spend a spell in hospital. His smoking and drinking had now become life-threatening. Although he cancelled concerts in Rome, Warsaw and Berlin, he maintained an engagement in London but there too his Third Symphony failed to attract the critics. In May 1908, Sibelius's health deteriorated further. He travelled with his wife to Berlin to have a tumour removed from his throat. After the operation, he vowed to give up smoking and drinking once and for all. The impact of this brush with death has been said to have inspired works that he composed in the following years, including \"Luonnotar\" and the Fourth Symphony.\nMore pleasant times.\nIn 1909, the successful throat operation resulted in renewed happiness between Sibelius and Aino in the family home. In Britain too, his condition was well received as he conducted \"En saga\", \"Finlandia\", \"Valse Triste\" and \"Spring Song\" to enthusiastic audiences. A meeting with Claude Debussy produced further support. After another uneventful trip to Paris, he went to Berlin where he was relieved to learn that his throat operation had been entirely successful.\nSibelius started work on his Fourth Symphony in early 1910 but his dwindling funds also required him to write a number of smaller pieces and songs. In October, he conducted concerts in Kristiania (now Oslo) where \"The Dryad\" and \"In Memoriam\" were first performed. His \"Valse triste\" and Second Symphony were particularly well received. He then travelled to Berlin to continue work on his Fourth Symphony, writing the finale after returning to J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4.\nSibelius conducted his first concerts in Sweden in early 1911 when even his Third Symphony was welcomed by the critics. He completed the Fourth Symphony in April but, as he expected, with its introspective style it was not very warmly received when first performed in Helsinki with mixed reviews. Apart from a trip to Paris where he enjoyed a performance of Richard Strauss's \"Salome\", the rest of the year was fairly uneventful. In 1912, he completed his short orchestral work \"Sc\u00e8nes historiques II\". It was first performed in March together with the Fourth Symphony. The concert was repeated twice to enthusiastic audiences and critics including Robert Kajanus. The Fourth Symphony was also well received in Birmingham in September. In March 1913, it was performed in New York but a large section of the audience left the hall between the movements while in October, after a concert conducted by Carl Muck, the \"Boston American\" labelled it \"a sad failure\".\nSibelius's first significant composition of 1913 was the tone poem \"The Bard\", which he conducted in March to a respectful audience in Helsinki. He went on to compose \"Luonnotar\" (Daughter of Nature) for soprano and orchestra. With a text from the \"Kalevala\", it was first performed in Finnish in September 1913 by Aino Ackt\u00e9 (to whom it had been dedicated) at the music festival in Gloucester, England. In early 1914, Sibelius spent a month in Berlin where he was particularly drawn to Arnold Schoenberg. Back in Finland, he began work on \"The Oceanides\", which the American millionaire Carl Stoeckel had commissioned for the Norfolk Music Festival. After first composing the work in D-flat major, Sibelius undertook substantive revisions, presenting a D major version in Norfolk, which was well received, as were \"Finlandia\" and the \"Valse triste\". Henry Krehbiel considered \"The Oceanides\" one of the most beautiful pieces of sea music ever composed, while \"The New York Times\" commented that Sibelius's music was the most notable contribution to the music festival. While in America, Sibelius received an honorary doctorate from Yale University and, almost simultaneously, one from the University of Helsinki where he was represented by Aino.\nFirst World War years.\nWhile travelling back from the United States, Sibelius heard about the events in Sarajevo that led to the beginning of the First World War. Although he was far away from the fighting, his royalties from abroad were interrupted. To make ends meet, he composed smaller works for publication in Finland. In March 1915, he was able to travel to Gothenburg in Sweden, where his work \"The Oceanides\" was widely appreciated. While working on his Fifth Symphony in April, he saw 16 swans flying by, inspiring him to write the finale. \"One of the great experiences of my life!\" he commented. Although there was little progress on the symphony during the summer, he was able to complete it by his 50th birthday on 8 December.\nOn the evening of his birthday, Sibelius conducted the premiere of the Fifth Symphony in the hall of the Helsinki Stock Exchange. Despite high praise from Kajanus, the composer was not satisfied with his work and soon began to revise it. Around this time, Sibelius was running ever deeper into debt. The grand piano he had received as a present was about to be confiscated by the bailiffs when the singer Ida Ekman paid off a large proportion of his debt after a successful fund-raising campaign.\nA year later, on 8 December 1916, Sibelius presented the revised version of his Fifth Symphony in Turku, combining the first two movements and simplifying the finale. When it was performed a week later in Helsinki, Katila was very favourable but Wasenius frowned on the changes, leading the composer to rewrite it once again.\nFrom the beginning of 1917, Sibelius started drinking again, triggering arguments with Aino. Their relationship improved with the excitement resulting from the start of the Russian Revolution. By the end of the year, Sibelius had composed his \"J\u00e4ger March\". The piece proved particularly popular after the Finnish parliament accepted the Senate's declaration of independence from Russia in December 1917. The \"J\u00e4ger March\", first played on 19 January 1918, delighted the Helsinki elite for a short time until the start of the Finnish Civil War on 27 January. Sibelius naturally supported the Whites, but as a Tolstoyan, Aino Sibelius had some sympathies for the Reds too.\nIn February, his house (Ainola) was searched twice by the local Red Guard looking for weapons. During the first weeks of the war, some of his acquaintances were killed in the violence, and his brother, the psychiatrist Christian Sibelius, was arrested because he refused to reserve beds for the Red soldiers who had suffered shell shock at the front. Sibelius's friends in Helsinki were now worried about his safety. The composer Robert Kajanus negotiated with the Red Guard commander-in-chief Eero Haapalainen, who guaranteed Sibelius a safe journey from Ainola to the capital. On 20 February, a group of Red Guard fighters escorted the family to Helsinki. Finally, from 12 to 13 April, the German troops occupied the city and the Red period was over. A week later, the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra gave a concert in homage to the German commander R\u00fcdiger von der Goltz. Sibelius finished off the event by conducting the \"J\u00e4ger March\".\nRevived fortunes but growing hand tremor.\nIn early 1919, Sibelius enthusiastically decided to change his image, shaving off what remained of his thinning hair. In June, together with Aino, he visited Copenhagen on his first trip outside Finland since 1915, successfully presenting his Second Symphony. In November he conducted the final version of his Fifth Symphony, receiving repeated ovations from the audience. By the end of the year, he was already working on the Sixth.\nIn 1920, despite a growing tremor in his hands, Sibelius composed the \"Hymn of the Earth\" to a text by the poet Eino Leino for the Suomen Laulu Choir and orchestrated his \"Valse lyrique\", helped along by drinking wine. On his birthday in December 1920, Sibelius received a donation of 63,000 marks, a substantial sum the tenor W\u00e4in\u00f6 Sola had raised from Finnish businesses. Although he used some of the money to reduce his debts, he also spent a week celebrating to excess in Helsinki.\nAt this time, Sibelius held detailed negotiations with George Eastman, inventor of the Kodak camera and founder of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. Eastman offered $20,000 salary to teach for a single year, and before Sibelius declined, negotiations were so firm that the \"New York Times\" published Sibelius's arrival as fact.\nSibelius enjoyed a highly successful trip to Britain in early 1921\u2014conducting several concerts around the country, including the Fourth and Fifth symphonies, \"The Oceanides\", the ever-popular \"Finlandia\", and \"Valse triste\". Immediately afterwards, he conducted the Second Symphony and \"Valse triste\" in Norway. He was beginning to suffer from exhaustion, but the critics remained positive. On his return to Finland in April, he presented \"Lemmink\u00e4inen's Return\" and the Fifth Symphony at the Nordic Music Days.\nEarly in 1922, after suffering from headaches Sibelius decided to acquire spectacles although he never wore them for photographs. In July, he was saddened by the death of his brother Christian. In August, he joined the Finnish Freemasons and composed ritual music for them. In February 1923, he premiered his Sixth Symphony. Evert Katila highly praised it as \"pure idyll.\" Before the year ended he had also conducted concerts in Stockholm and Rome, the first to considerable acclaim, the second to mixed reviews. He then proceeded to Gothenburg where he enjoyed an ecstatic reception despite arriving at the concert hall suffering from over-indulgence in food and drink. Despite continuing to drink, to Aino's dismay, Sibelius managed to complete his Seventh Symphony in March 1924. Under the title of \"Fantasia sinfonica\" it received its first public performance in Stockholm where it was a success. It was even more highly appreciated at a series of concerts in Copenhagen in late September. Sibelius was honoured with the Knight Commander's Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog.\nHe spent most of the rest of the year resting as his recent spate of activity was straining his heart and nerves. Composing a few small pieces, he relied increasingly on alcohol. In May 1925, his Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen and the Royal Danish Theatre invited him to compose incidental music for a production of Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\". He completed the work well in advance of its premiere in March 1926. It was well received in Copenhagen although Sibelius was not there himself.\nThe music journalist Vesa Sir\u00e9n has found evidence that Sibelius perhaps suffered from essential tremor since a young age and that he reduced the symptoms by drinking alcohol. This self-medication is common and effective but discouraged by doctors due to the risks outweighing the benefits. Sir\u00e9n's research is supported by several medical experts. The tremor presumably prevented writing and impaired his social life.\nLast major works.\nThe year 1926 saw a sharp and lasting decline in Sibelius's output: after his Seventh Symphony, he produced only a few major works during the rest of his life. Arguably the two most significant of these were the incidental music for \"The Tempest\" and the tone poem \"Tapiola\". For most of the last thirty years of his life, Sibelius even avoided talking publicly about his music.\nThere is substantial evidence that Sibelius worked on an eighth symphony. He promised the premiere of this symphony to Serge Koussevitzky in 1931 and 1932, and a London performance in 1933 under Basil Cameron was even advertised to the public. The only concrete evidence of the symphony's existence on paper is a 1933 bill for a fair copy of the first movement and short draft fragments first published and played in 2011. Sibelius had always been quite self-critical; he remarked to his close friends, \"If I cannot write a better symphony than my Seventh, then it shall be my last.\" Since no manuscript survives, sources consider it likely that Sibelius destroyed most traces of the score, probably in 1945, during which year he certainly consigned a great many papers to the flames. His wife Aino recalled,\nIn the 1940s there was a great \"auto da f\u00e9\" at Ainola. My husband collected a number of the manuscripts in a laundry basket and burned them on the open fire in the dining room. Parts of the \"Karelia Suite\" were destroyed\u00a0\u2013 I later saw remains of the pages which had been torn out\u00a0\u2013 and many other things. I did not have the strength to be present and left the room. I therefore do not know what he threw on to the fire. But after this my husband became calmer and gradually lighter in mood.\nDespite his withdrawing from the public eye, Sibelius's work gained substantial attention in the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s thanks to the newly established Finnish broadcaster YLE. Broadcasting on AM wavebands, YLE's signals brought Sibelius's music to listeners beyond Finland's borders, too. In 1933, YLE and the Helsinki City Orchestra with soloist Anja Ignatius originated a broadcast of Sibelius compositions to 14 countries in coordination with the International Broadcasting Union. The program included the tone poem \"The Oceanides\", followed by his Fifth Symphony, and the Violin Concerto. In 1935 The New York Philharmonic surveyed the preferences of music listeners around the United States. When asked who their favourite composer was, Sibelius came first among all of them, living or dead. This degree of recognition during his own lifetime was unequalled in Western music.\nSecond World War years.\nOn Sibelius's 70th birthday (8 December 1935), the German Nazi regime awarded him the Goethe-Medal with a certificate signed by Adolf Hitler. After the attempted Soviet invasion of Finland in late 1939 to 1940 (the Winter War) which, though initially repelled, forced Finland to cede territory to the Soviet Union after the later defeat of the Finnish military, the Sibelius family returned for good to Ainola in the summer of 1941, after a long absence. Anxious about Bolshevism, Sibelius advocated that Finnish soldiers march alongside German forces after Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. Sibelius did not make any utterances about the genocide of the Jews, although, in a diary entry in 1943, he wondered why he had signed the Aryan certificate.\nOn 1 January 1939, Sibelius had participated in an international radio broadcast during which he conducted his \"Andante Festivo\". The performance was preserved on transcription discs and later issued on CD. This is probably the only surviving example of Sibelius interpreting his own music.\nLater years and death.\nFrom 1903 and for many years thereafter Sibelius lived in the countryside. From 1939 he and Aino again had a home in Helsinki, but they moved back to Ainola in 1941, only occasionally visiting the city. After the war he returned to Helsinki only a couple of times. The so-called \"silence of J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4\" became something of a myth, as in addition to countless official visitors and colleagues, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren also spent their holidays there.\nSibelius avoided public statements about other composers, but Erik W. Tawaststjerna and Sibelius's secretary Santeri Levas have documented private conversations in which he admired Richard Strauss and considered B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k and Dmitri Shostakovich the most talented composers of the younger generation. In the 1950s he promoted the young Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara.\nHis 90th birthday, in 1955, was widely celebrated, and both the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Sir Thomas Beecham gave special performances of his music.\nTawaststjerna recounts an anecdote from September 1957 in connection with Sibelius's death:\n[He] was returning from his customary morning walk. Exhilarated, he told his wife Aino that he had seen a flock of cranes approaching. \"There they come, the birds of my youth,\" he exclaimed. Suddenly, one of the birds broke away from the formation and circled once above Ainola. It then rejoined the flock to continue its journey.\nTwo days later, on the evening of 20 September 1957, Sibelius died of a brain haemorrhage at Ainola, at the age of 91. At the time of his death, his Fifth Symphony, conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent, was being broadcast by radio from Helsinki. At the same time, the United Nations General Assembly was in session, and the then President of the Assembly, Sir Leslie Munro of New Zealand, called for a moment of silence and delivered a eulogy: \"Sibelius belonged to the whole world. He enriched the life of the entire human race with his music\". Another well-known Finnish composer, Heino Kaski, died one day earlier, but his death was overshadowed by that of Sibelius. Sibelius was honoured with a state funeral and is buried in the garden at Ainola.\nAino Sibelius continued to live at Ainola for nearly 12 years, until her death on 8\u00a0June 1969 at the age of 97. She is buried beside her husband.\nMusic.\nSibelius is widely known for his symphonies and his tone poems, especially \"Finlandia\" and the \"Karelia suite\". His reputation in Finland grew in the 1890s with the choral symphony \"Kullervo\", which like many subsequent pieces drew on the epic poem \"Kalevala\". His First Symphony was first performed to an enthusiastic audience in 1899 at a time when Finnish nationalism was evolving. In addition to six more symphonies, he gained popularity at home and abroad with incidental music and more tone poems, especially \"En saga\", \"The Swan of Tuonela\" and \"Valse triste\". Sibelius also composed a series of works for violin and orchestra including a Violin Concerto, the opera \"Jungfrun i tornet\", many shorter orchestral pieces, chamber music, works for piano and violin, choral works and numerous songs.\nIn the mid-1920s, after his Sixth and Seventh Symphonies, he composed the symphonic poem \"Tapiola\" and incidental music for \"The Tempest\". Thereafter, although he lived until 1957, he did not publish any further works of note. For several years, he worked on an Eighth Symphony, which he later burned.\nAs for his musical style, hints of Tchaikovsky's music are particularly evident in early works such as his First Symphony and his Violin Concerto. For a period, he was nevertheless overwhelmed by Wagner, particularly while composing his opera. More lasting influences included Ferruccio Busoni and Anton Bruckner. But for his tone poems, he was above all inspired by Liszt. The similarities to Bruckner can be seen in the brass contributions to his orchestral works and the generally slow tempo of his music.\nSibelius progressively stripped away formal markers of sonata form in his work and, instead of contrasting multiple themes, focused on the idea of continuously evolving cells and fragments culminating in a grand statement. His later works are remarkable for their sense of unbroken development, progressing by means of thematic permutations and derivations. The completeness and organic feel of this synthesis has prompted some to suggest that Sibelius began his works with a finished statement and worked backwards, although analyses showing these predominantly three- and four-note cells and melodic fragments as they are developed and expanded into the larger \"themes\" effectively prove the opposite.\nThis self-contained structure stood in stark contrast to the symphonic style of Gustav Mahler, Sibelius's primary rival in symphonic composition. While thematic variation played a major role in the works of both composers, Mahler's style made use of disjunct, abruptly changing and contrasting themes, while Sibelius sought to slowly transform thematic elements. In November 1907 Mahler undertook a conducting tour of Finland, and the two composers were able to take a lengthy walk together, leading Sibelius to comment:\nI said that I admired [the symphony's] severity of style and the profound logic that created an inner connection between all the motifs\u00a0... Mahler's opinion was just the reverse. \"No, a symphony must be like the world. It must embrace everything.\"\nSymphonies.\nSibelius started work on his Symphony No. 1 in E minor, Op. 39, in 1898 and completed it in early 1899, when he was 33. The work was first performed on 26 April 1899 by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by the composer, in an original, well received version that has not survived. After the premiere, Sibelius made some revisions, resulting in the version performed today. The revision was completed in the spring and summer of 1900, and was first performed in Berlin by the Helsinki Philharmonic, conducted by Robert Kajanus on 18 July 1900. The symphony begins with a highly original, rather forlorn clarinet solo backed by subdued timpani.\nHis Second Symphony, the most popular and most frequently recorded of his symphonies, was first performed by the Helsinki Philharmonic Society on 8 March 1902, with the composer conducting. The opening chords with their rising progression provide a motif for the whole work. The heroic theme of the finale with the three-tone motif is interpreted by the trumpets rather than the original woodwinds. During a period of Russian oppression, it consolidated Sibelius's reputation as a national hero. After the first performance, Sibelius made some changes, leading to a revised version first performed by Armas J\u00e4rnefelt on 10 November 1903 in Stockholm.\nThe Third Symphony is a good-natured, triumphal, and deceptively simple-sounding piece. The symphony's first performance was given by the Helsinki Philharmonic Society, conducted by the composer, on 25 September 1907. There are themes from Finnish folk music in the work's early chords. Composed just after his move to Ainola, it contrasts sharply with the first two symphonies, with its clear mode of expression developing into the marching tones of the finale.\nHis Fourth Symphony was premiered in Helsinki on 3 April 1911 by the Philharmonia Society, with Sibelius conducting. It was written while Sibelius was undergoing a series of operations to remove a tumour from his throat. Its grimness can perhaps be explained as a reaction from his (temporary) decision to give up drinking. The opening bars, with cellos, basses and bassoons, convey a new approach to timing. It then develops into melancholic sketches based on the composer's setting of Poe's \"The Raven\". The waning finale is perhaps a premonition of the silence Sibelius would experience twenty years later. In contrast to the usual assertive finales of the times, the work ends simply with a \"leaden thud\".\nThe Symphony No. 5 was premiered in Helsinki to great acclaim by Sibelius himself on 8 December 1915, his 50th birthday. The version most commonly performed today is the final revision, consisting of three movements, presented in 1919. The Fifth is Sibelius's only symphony in a major key throughout. From its soft opening played by the horns, the work develops into rotational repetitions of its various themes with considerable transformations, building up to the trumpeted swan hymn in the final movement.\nWhile the Fifth had already started to veer away from the sonata form, the Sixth, conducted by the composer at its premiere in February 1923, is even further removed from the traditional norms. Tawaststjerna comments that \"the [finale's] structure follows no familiar pattern\". Composed in the Dorian mode, it draws on some of the themes developed while Sibelius was working on the Fifth as well as from material intended for a lyrical violin concerto. Now taking a purified approach, Sibelius sought to offer \"spring water\" rather than cocktails, making use of lighter flutes and strings rather than the heavy brass of the Fifth.\nThe Symphony No. 7 in C major was his last published symphony. Completed in 1924, it is notable for having only one movement. It has been described as \"completely original in form, subtle in its handling of tempi, individual in its treatment of key and wholly organic in growth\". It has also been called \"Sibelius's most remarkable compositional achievement\". Initially titled \"Fantasia sinfonica\", it was first performed in Stockholm in March 1924, conducted by Sibelius. It was based on an adagio movement he had sketched almost ten years earlier. While the strings dominate, there is also a distinctive trombone theme.\nTone poems.\nAfter the seven symphonies and the violin concerto, Sibelius's thirteen symphonic poems are his most important works for orchestra and, along with the tone poems of Richard Strauss, represent some of the most important contributions to the genre since Franz Liszt. As a group, the symphonic poems span the entirety of Sibelius's artistic career (the first was composed in 1892, while the last appeared in 1926), display the composer's fascination with nature and Finnish mythology (particularly the \"Kalevala\"), and provide a comprehensive portrait of his stylistic maturation over time.\n\"En saga\" (meaning \"A Fairy Tale\" in Swedish) was first presented in February 1893 with Sibelius conducting. The single-movement tone poem was possibly inspired by the Icelandic mythological work \"Edda\" although Sibelius simply described it as \"an expression of [his] state of mind\". Beginning with a dreamy theme from the strings, it evolves into the tones of the woodwinds, then the horns and the violas, demonstrating Sibelius's ability to handle an orchestra. The composer's first significant orchestral piece, it was revised in 1902 when Ferruccio Busoni invited Sibelius to conduct his work in Berlin. Its successful reception encouraged him to write to Aino: \"I have been acknowledged as an accomplished 'artist'\".\n\"The Wood Nymph\", a single-movement tone poem for orchestra, was written in 1894. Premiered in April 1895 in Helsinki with Sibelius conducting, it is inspired by the Swedish poet Viktor Rydberg's work of the same name. Organizationally, it consists of four informal sections, each corresponding to one of the poem's four stanzas and evoking the mood of a particular episode: first, heroic vigour; second, frenetic activity; third, sensual love; and fourth, inconsolable grief. Despite the music's beauty, many critics have faulted Sibelius for his \"over-reliance\" on the source material's narrative structure.\nThe \"Lemmink\u00e4inen Suite\" was composed in the early 1890s. Originally conceived as a mythological opera, \"Veneen luominen\" (\"The Building of the Boat\"), on a scale matching those by Richard Wagner, Sibelius later changed his musical goals and the work became an orchestral piece in four movements. The suite is based on the character Lemmink\u00e4inen from the Finnish national epic, the \"Kalevala\". It can also be considered a collection of symphonic poems. The second/third section, \"The Swan of Tuonela\", is often heard separately.\n\"Finlandia\", probably the best known of all Sibelius's works, is a highly patriotic piece first performed in November 1899 as one of the tableaux for the Finnish Press Celebrations. It had its public premiere in revised form in July 1900. The current title only emerged later, first for the piano version, then in 1901 when Kajanus conducted the orchestral version under the name \"Finlandia\". Although Sibelius insisted it was primarily an orchestral piece, it became a world favourite for choirs too, especially for the hymn episode. Finally the composer consented and in 1937 and 1940 agreed to words for the hymn, first for the Freemasons and later for more general use.\n\"The Oceanides\" is a single-movement tone poem for orchestra written in 1913\u201314. The piece, which refers to the nymphs in Greek mythology who inhabited the Mediterranean Sea, premiered on 4 June 1914 at the Norfolk Music Festival in Connecticut with Sibelius himself conducting. The work (in D major), praised upon its premiere as \"the finest evocation of the sea ever produced in music\", consists of two subjects Sibelius gradually develops in three informal stages: first, a placid ocean; second, a gathering storm; and third, a thunderous wave-crash climax. As the tempest subsides, a final chord sounds, symbolizing the mighty power and limitless expanse of the sea.\n\"Tapiola\", Sibelius's last major orchestral work, was commissioned by Walter Damrosch for the New York Philharmonic Society where it was premiered on 26 December 1926. It is inspired by Tapio, a forest spirit from the \"Kalevala\". To quote the American critic Alex Ross, it \"turned out to be Sibelius's most severe and concentrated musical statement.\" Even more emphatically, the composer and biographer Cecil Gray asserts: \"Even if Sibelius had written nothing else, this one work would entitle him to a place among the greatest masters of all time.\"\nOther important works.\nThe \"Karelia Music\", one of the composer's earlier works, written for the Vyborg Students' Association, was first performed on 13 November 1893 to a noisy audience. The \"Suite\" emerged from a concert on 23 November consisting of the overture and the three movements, which were published as the \"Karelia Overture\", Op. 10, and the \"Karelia Suite\", Op. 11. It remains one of Sibelius's most popular pieces.\n\"Valse triste\" is a short orchestral work that was originally part of the incidental music Sibelius composed for his brother-in-law Arvid J\u00e4rnefelt's 1903 play \"Kuolema\" (\"Death\"). It is now far better known as a separate concert piece. Sibelius wrote six pieces for the 2 December 1903 production of \"Kuolema\". The waltz accompanied a sequence in which a woman rises from her deathbed to dance with ghosts. In 1904, Sibelius revised the piece for a performance in Helsinki on 25 April where it was presented as \"Valse triste\". An instant success, it took on a life of its own, and remains one of Sibelius's signature pieces.\nThe Violin Concerto in D minor was first performed on 8 February 1904 with Victor Nov\u00e1\u010dek as soloist. As Sibelius had barely completed the piece in time for the premiere, Nov\u00e1\u010dek had insufficient time to prepare, with the result that the performance was a disaster. After substantial revisions, a new version was premiered on 19 October 1905 with Richard Strauss conducting the Berlin Court Orchestra. With Karel Hal\u00ed\u0159, the orchestra's leader, as soloist it was a tremendous success. The piece has become increasingly popular and is now the most frequently recorded of all the violin concertos composed in the 20th century.\n\"Kullervo\", one of Sibelius's early works, is sometimes referred to as a choral symphony but is better described as a suite of five symphonic movements resembling tone poems. Based on the character Kullervo from the \"Kalevala\", it was premiered on 28 April 1892 with Emmy Acht\u00e9 and Abraham Ojanper\u00e4 as soloists and Sibelius conducting the chorus and orchestra of the recently founded Helsinki Orchestra Society. Although the work was only performed five times during the composer's lifetime, since the 1990s it has become increasingly popular both for live performances and recordings.\nActivities and interests.\nWhen Freemasonry in Finland was revived, having been forbidden under the Russian reign, Sibelius was one of the founding members of Suomi Lodge No. 1 in 1922 and later became the Grand Organist of the Grand Lodge of Finland. He composed the ritual music used in Finland (Op. 113) in 1927 and added two new pieces composed in 1946. The new revision of the ritual music of 1948 is one of his last works.\nSibelius loved nature, and the Finnish landscape often served as material for his music. He once said of his Sixth Symphony, \"[It] always reminds me of the scent of the first snow.\" The forests surrounding Ainola are often said to have inspired his composition of \"Tapiola\". On the subject of Sibelius's ties to nature, his biographer, Tawaststjerna, wrote:\nEven by Nordic standards, Sibelius responded with exceptional intensity to the moods of nature and the changes in the seasons: he scanned the skies with his binoculars for the geese flying over the lake ice, listened to the screech of the cranes, and heard the cries of the curlew echo over the marshy grounds just below Ainola. He savoured the spring blossoms every bit as much as he did autumnal scents and colours.\nReception and influence.\nThe composer and academic Elliott Schwartz wrote (1964), \"It may be said with truth that Vaughan Williams, Sibelius and Prokofieff are the symphonists of this century\". Indeed, Sibelius exerted considerable influence on symphonic composers and musical life. His impact is perhaps the greatest in English-speaking and Nordic countries. The Finnish symphonist Leevi Madetoja was a pupil of Sibelius (for more on their relationship, see Relationship with Sibelius). In Britain, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Arnold Bax both dedicated their fifth symphonies to Sibelius. Vaughan Williams said of him \"You have lit a candle in the world of music that will never go out.\" Furthermore, \"Tapiola\" is prominently echoed in both Bax's Sixth Symphony and Ernest John Moeran's Symphony in G minor. The influence of Sibelius's compositional procedures is also strongly felt in the First Symphony of William Walton. When these and several other major British symphonic essays were being written in and around the 1930s, Sibelius's music was very much in vogue, with conductors Thomas Beecham and John Barbirolli championing its cause both in the concert hall and on record. Walton's composer friend Constant Lambert even asserted that Sibelius was \"the first great composer since Beethoven whose mind thinks naturally in terms of symphonic form\". Earlier, Granville Bantock had championed Sibelius. The esteem was mutual: Sibelius dedicated his Third Symphony to the English composer, and in 1946 he became the first President of the Bantock Society. More recently, Sibelius was also one of the composers championed by Robert Simpson. Malcolm Arnold acknowledged his influence, and Arthur Butterworth also saw Sibelius's music as a source of inspiration in his work. Third Symphony of Peter Maxwell Davies was heavily influenced by Sibelius and Thomas Ad\u00e8s even named his 2022 orchestral work \"Air \u2013 Homage to Sibelius\". New Zealand's most accomplished 20th century composer, Douglas Lilburn, has written of the inspiration he derived from Sibelius's work, particularly from his earlier compositions.\nSome of Sibelius's musical ideas have been seen as foreshadowing minimalism. This is perhaps best exemplified by some of his tone poems, such as the repetitive rhythmic patterns and gradual development of musical ideas in \"Nightride and Sunrise\", \"The Bard\" and \"Luonnotar\". The British conductor Thomas Kemp has suggested that Sibelius might be, in fact, viewed as a proto-minimalist. Among contemporary minimalists composers his influence can be heard, among others, in Arvo P\u00e4rt, John Adams and Philip Glass. Adams in particular has a strong affinity towards Sibelius, citing him as a substantial influence on his compositional style. Notably, Sibelius's Seventh Symphony provided a model for the ultimate form of Adams's \"Doctor Atomic Symphony\". Among Glass's compositions, his opera \"The Voyage\" has been described as having a particularly Sibelian quality.\nEugene Ormandy and his predecessor at the Philadelphia Orchestra Leopold Stokowski, were instrumental in bringing Sibelius's music to American audiences by frequently programming his works; the former developed a friendly relationship with Sibelius throughout his life. Later in life, Sibelius was championed by the American critic Olin Downes, who wrote a biography of the composer.\nIn 1938 Theodor Adorno wrote a critical essay, notoriously charging that \"If Sibelius is good, this invalidates the standards of musical quality that have persisted from Bach to Schoenberg: the richness of inter-connectedness, articulation, unity in diversity, the 'multi-faceted' in 'the one'.\" Adorno sent his essay to Virgil Thomson, then music critic of the \"New York Herald Tribune\", who was also critical of Sibelius. Thomson, while agreeing with the essay's sentiment, declared to Adorno that \"the tone of it [was] more apt to create antagonism toward [Adorno] than toward Sibelius\". Later, the composer, theorist and conductor Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz went so far as to describe Sibelius as \"the worst composer in the world\" in the title of a 1955 pamphlet.\nPerhaps one reason why Sibelius has attracted both praise and ire from critics is that, in each of his seven symphonies, he approached the challenges of form, tonality, and architecture in unique, individual ways. On the one hand, his symphonic (and tonal) creativity was novel, while others thought that music should be taking a different route. Sibelius's response to criticism was dismissive: \"Pay no attention to what critics say. No statue has ever been put up to a critic.\"\nIn the later decades of the twentieth century, Sibelius came to be seen more favourably. Many influential 20th and 21st-century composers, including Morton Feldman, Gerard Grisey, and Magnus Lindberg, have expressed high regard for his compositions. The American composer Jonathan Blumhofer has said: \"The visionary aspects of Sibelius\u2019 music, particularly the tight unity of musical elements and his singular way with large-scale forms, have helped ensure him that rarest of gifts given popular composers: a measure of academic respectability.\" Milan Kundera said the composer's approach was that of \"antimodern modernism\", standing outside \u201cthe status quo of perpetual progress\u201d. Similarly, the philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek contrasts Sibelius to the \"modernist\" approach of Schoenberg and the \"post-modernist\" one of Stravinsky; for \u017di\u017eek, Sibelius represents the alternative of \"persistent traditionalism\", of continuing in the inherited tradition but with artistic integrity, not as a \"phony conservative\". In 1990, the composer Thea Musgrave was commissioned by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra to write a piece in honour of the 125th anniversary of Sibelius's birth: \"Song of the Enchanter\" premiered on 14 February 1991. In 1984, the American avant-garde composer Morton Feldman gave a lecture in Darmstadt, Germany, wherein he stated that \"the people you think are radicals might really be conservatives\u00a0\u2013 the people you think are conservatives might really be radical\", whereupon he began to hum Sibelius's Fifth Symphony.\nWriting in 1996, the Pulitzer Prize-winning music critic Tim Page stated, \"There are two things to be said straightaway about Sibelius. First, he is terribly uneven (much of his chamber music, a lot of his songs and most of his piano music might have been churned out by a second-rate salon composer from the 19th century on an off afternoon). Second, at his very best, he is often weird.\" Pianist Leif Ove Andsnes offers a counterweight to Page's assessment of Sibelius's piano music. Acknowledging that this body of work is uneven in quality, Andsnes believes that the common critical dismissal is unwarranted. In performing selected piano works, Andsnes finds that audiences were \"astonished that there could be a major composer out there with such beautiful, accessible music that people don't know\".\nFor the 150th anniversary of Sibelius's birth, the Helsinki Music Centre planned a daily illustrated and narrated \"Sibelius Finland Experience Show\" during the summer of 2015, also planned to extend into 2016 and 2017. On 8 December, the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by John Storg\u00e5rds planned a commemorative concert featuring \"En Saga\", \"Luonnotar\" and the Seventh Symphony.\nLegacy.\nIn 1972, Sibelius's surviving daughters sold Ainola to the Finnish state. The Ministry of Education and the Sibelius Society of Finland opened it as a museum in 1974. Sibelius has been memorialized by art, stamps, and currency; the Finnish 100 mark bill featured his image until 2002 when the euro was adopted. Since 2011, Finland has celebrated a flag flying day on 8 December, the composer's birthday, also known as the \"Day of Finnish Music\". The year 2015, the 150th anniversary of the composer's birth, featured a number of special concerts and events, especially in the city of Helsinki.\nThe quinquennial International Jean Sibelius Violin Competition, instituted in 1965, the Sibelius Monument, unveiled in 1967 in Helsinki's Sibelius Park, the Sibelius Museum, opened in Turku in 1968, and the Sibelius Hall concert hall in Lahti, opened in 2000, were all named in his honour, as was the asteroid 1405 Sibelius.\nThe complete edition of Sibelius's \u0153uvre has been in preparation in Finland since 1996. It is a joint venture between the National Library of Finland, the Sibelius Society of Finland, and Breitkopf &amp; H\u00e4rtel publishers. When finished, this critical edition will comprise 60 volumes.\nSibelius kept a diary from 1909 to 1944, and his family allowed it to be published, unabridged, in 2005. The diary was edited by Fabian Dahlstr\u00f6m and published in the Swedish language in 2005. To celebrate the 150th anniversary of the composer, the entire diary was also published in the Finnish language in 2015. Several volumes of Sibelius's correspondence have also been edited and published in Swedish, Finnish and English.\nThe legacy of Sibelius is celebrated through an array of statues, monuments, parks, and similar honours. Among the most well known is the Sibelius Monument, a renowned piece of sculpture in its own right, located in the capital of Finland, Helsinki. It is surrounded by the eponymous park, which is among the most visited sites by sightseers visiting the city.\nThe scorewriter program Sibelius is named after him.\nManuscripts.\nParts of the literary estate of Sibelius\u2014correspondence and manuscripts\u2014are preserved at the National Archives of Finland and National Library of Finland, but several items are in foreign private collections, even as investments, only partially accessible for scholars.\nIn 1970, a lot of 50 music manuscript items was acquired by the National Library with aid from the government of Finland, banks and foundations. Sibelius's personal music archive was donated to the National Library in 1982 by the heirs of the composer.\nAnother lot of 50 items was procured in 1997, with aid from the Ministry of Education. In 2018, the Italian-Finnish collector and benefactor Rolando Pieraccini donated a collection of Sibelius's letters and other materials to the National Museum of Finland. On the other hand, in 2016 the manuscript of \"Pohjola's Daughter\" was sold to an anonymous buyer for 290,000 euros, and it is no longer available to scholars.\nIn early 2020, the current owner of the Robert Lienau collection offered for sale 1,200 pages of manuscripts, including the scores of \"Voces intimae\", \"Joutsikki\", and \"Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande\", and the material was not available to scholars during negotiations. The original price tag was said to be over one million euros for the lot as a whole. At the end of the year, the National Library was able to acquire this collection with aid from foundations and donors. The final price was \"considerably below one million euros.\"\nNowadays, it is not legally possible to export Sibelius's manuscripts from Finland without permission, and, according to \"Hufvudstadsbladet\", such permission would probably not be given.\nIn 2021, the music manuscripts of Sibelius were included in the Memory of the World Programme by the UNESCO.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

A prolific writer who often drew directly on his personal experience, Strindberg wrote more than 60 plays and more than 30 works of fiction, autobiography, history, cultural analysis, and politics during his career, which spanned four decades. A bold experimenter and iconoclast throughout his life, he explored a wide range of dramatic methods and purposes, from naturalistic tragedy, monodrama, and historical plays to his anticipations of expressionist and surrealist dramatic techniques. From his earliest work, Strindberg developed innovative forms of dramatic action, language, and visual composition. He is considered the \"father\" of modern Swedish literature and his \"The Red Room\" (1879) has frequently been described as the first modern Swedish novel. In Sweden, Strindberg is known as an essayist, painter, poet, and especially novelist and playwright, but in other countries he is known mostly as a playwright.\nThe Royal Theatre rejected his first major play, \"Master Olof\", in 1872; it was not until 1881, when he was thirty-two, that its premi\u00e8re at the New Theatre gave him his theatrical breakthrough. In his plays \"The Father\" (1887), \"Miss Julie\" (1888), and \"Creditors\" (1889), he created naturalistic dramas that \u2013 building on the established accomplishments of Henrik Ibsen's prose problem plays while rejecting their use of the structure of the well-made play \u2013 responded to the call-to-arms of \u00c9mile Zola's manifesto \"Naturalism in the Theatre\" (1881) and the example set by Andr\u00e9 Antoine's newly established (opened 1887). In \"Miss Julie\", characterisation replaces plot as the predominant dramatic element (in contrast to melodrama and the well-made play) and the determining role of heredity and the environment on the \"vacillating, disintegrated\" characters is emphasized. Strindberg modeled his short-lived Scandinavian Experimental Theatre (1889) in Copenhagen on Antoine's theatre and he explored the theory of Naturalism in his essays \"On Psychic Murder\" (1887), \"On Modern Drama and the Modern Theatre\" (1889), and a preface to \"Miss Julie\", the last of which is probably the best-known statement of the principles of the theatrical movement.\nDuring the 1890s he spent significant time abroad engaged in scientific experiments and studies of the occult. A series of apparent psychotic attacks between 1894 and 1896 (referred to as his \"\"Inferno\" crisis\") led to his hospitalization and return to Sweden. Under the influence of the ideas of Emanuel Swedenborg, he resolved after his recovery to become \"the Zola of the Occult\". In 1898 he returned to play-writing with \"To Damascus\", which, like \"The Great Highway\" (1909), is a dream-play of spiritual pilgrimage. His \"A Dream Play\" (1902) \u2013 with its radical attempt to dramatize the workings of the unconscious by means of an abolition of conventional dramatic time and space and the splitting, doubling, merging, and multiplication of its characters \u2013 was an important precursor to both expressionism and surrealism. He also returned to writing historical drama, the genre with which he had begun his play-writing career. He helped to run the Intimate Theatre from 1907, a small-scale theatre in Stockholm, modeled on Max Reinhardt's , that staged his chamber plays (such as \"The Ghost Sonata\").\nBiography.\nYouth.\nStrindberg was born on 22 January 1849 in Stockholm, Sweden, the third surviving son of Carl Oscar Strindberg (a shipping agent) and Eleonora Ulrika Norling (a serving-maid). In his autobiographical novel \"The Son of a Servant\", Strindberg describes a childhood affected by \"emotional insecurity, poverty, religious fanaticism and neglect\". When he was seven, the family moved to Norrtullsgatan on the northern, almost-rural, periphery of the city. A year later they moved near Sabbatsberg, where they stayed for three years before returning to Norrtullsgatan. He attended a harsh school in Klara for four years, an experience that haunted him in his adult life. He was moved to the school in Jakob in 1860, which he found far more pleasant, though he remained there for only a year. In the autumn of 1861, he was moved to the Stockholm Lyceum, a progressive private school for middle-class boys, where he remained for six years. As a child he had a keen interest in natural science, photography, and religion (following his mother's Pietism). His mother, Strindberg recalled later with bitterness, always resented her son's intelligence. She died when he was 13, and although his grief lasted for only three months, in later life he came to feel a sense of loss and longing for an idealized maternal figure. Less than a year after her death, his father married the children's governess, Emilia Charlotta Pettersson. According to his sisters, Strindberg came to regard them as his worst enemies. He passed his graduation examination in May 1867 and enrolled at the Uppsala University, where he began on 13 September.\nStrindberg spent the next few years in Uppsala and Stockholm, alternately studying for examinations and trying his hand at non-academic pursuits. As a young student, Strindberg also worked as an assistant in a pharmacy in the university town of Lund in southern Sweden. He supported himself in between studies as a substitute primary-school teacher and as a tutor for the children of two well-known physicians in Stockholm. He first left Uppsala in 1868 to work as a schoolteacher, but then studied chemistry for some time at the Institute of Technology in Stockholm in preparation for medical studies, later working as a private tutor before becoming an extra at the Royal Theatre in Stockholm. In May 1869, he failed his qualifying chemistry examination which in turn made him uninterested in schooling.\n1870s.\nStrindberg returned to Uppsala University in January 1870 to study aesthetics and modern languages and to work on a number of plays. It was at this time that he first learnt about the ideas of Charles Darwin. He co-founded the Rune Society, a small literary club whose members adopted pseudonyms taken from runes of the ancient Teutonic alphabet \u2013 Strindberg called himself Fr\u00f6 (Seed), after the god of fertility. After abandoning a draft of a play about Eric XIV of Sweden halfway through in the face of criticism from the Rune Society, on 30 March he completed a one-act comedy in verse called \"In Rome\" about Bertel Thorvaldsen, which he had begun the previous autumn. The play was accepted by the Royal Theatre, where it premi\u00e8red on 13 September 1870. As he watched it performed, he realised that it was not good and felt like drowning himself, though the reviews published the following day were generally favourable. That year he also first read works of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Georg Brandes, both of whom influenced him.\nTaking his cue from William Shakespeare, he began to use colloquial and realistic speech in his historical dramas, which challenged the convention that they should be written in stately verse. During the Christmas holiday of 1870\u201371, he rewrote a historical tragedy, \"Sven the Sacrificer\", as a one-act play in prose called \"The Outlaw\". Depressed by Uppsala, he stayed in Stockholm, returning to the university in April to pass an exam in Latin and in June to defend his thesis on Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl\u00e4ger's Romantic tragedy \"Earl Haakon\" (1802). Following further revision in the summer, \"The Outlaw\" opened at the Royal Theatre on 16 October 1871. Despite hostile reviews, the play earned him an audience with King Charles XV, who supported his studies with a payment of 200 riksdaler. Towards the end of the year Strindberg completed a first draft of his first major work, a play about Olaus Petri called \"Master Olof\". In September 1872, the Royal Theatre rejected it, leading to decades of rewrites, bitterness, and a contempt for official institutions. Returning to the university for what would be his final term in the spring, he left on 2\u00a0March 1872, without graduating. In \"Town and Gown\" (1877), a collection of short stories describing student life, he ridiculed Uppsala and its professors.\nStrindberg embarked on his career as a journalist and critic for newspapers in Stockholm. He was particularly excited at this time by Henry Thomas Buckle's \"History of Civilization\" and the first volume of Georg Brandes' \"Main Currents of Nineteenth-Century Literature\". From December 1874, Strindberg worked for eight years as an assistant librarian at the Royal Library. That same month, Strindberg offered \"Master Olof\" to Edvard Stjernstr\u00f6m (the director of the newly built New Theatre in Stockholm), but it was rejected. He socialised with writers, painters, journalists, and other librarians; they often met in the Red Room in Bern's Restaurant.\nEarly in the summer of 1875, he met Siri von Essen, a 24-year-old aspiring actress who, by virtue of her husband, was a baroness \u2013 he became infatuated with her. Strindberg described himself as a \"failed author\" at this time: \"I feel like a deaf-mute,\" he wrote, \"as I cannot speak and am not permitted to write; sometimes I stand in the middle of my room that seems like a prison cell, and then I want to scream so that walls and ceilings would fly apart, and I have so much to scream about, and therefore I remain silent.\" As a result of an argument in January 1876 concerning the inheritance of the family firm, Strindberg's relationship with his father was terminated (he did not attend his funeral in February 1883). From the beginning of 1876, Strindberg and Siri began to meet in secret, and that same year Siri and her husband divorced. Following a successful audition that December, Siri became an actress at the Royal Theatre. They married a year later, on 30 December 1877; Siri was seven months pregnant at the time. Their first child was born prematurely on 21 January 1878 and died two days later. On 9 January 1879, Strindberg was declared bankrupt. In November 1879, his novel \"The Red Room\" was published. A satire of Stockholm society, it has frequently been described as the first modern Swedish novel. While receiving mixed reviews in Sweden, it was acclaimed in Denmark, where Strindberg was hailed as a genius. As a result of \"The Red Room\", he had become famous throughout Scandinavia. Edvard Brandes wrote that the novel \"makes the reader want to join the fight against hypocrisy and reaction.\" In his response to Brandes, Strindberg explained that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I am a socialist, a nihilist, a republican, anything that is anti-reactionary!... I want to turn everything upside down to see what lies beneath; I believe we are so webbed, so horribly regimented, that no spring-cleaning is possible, everything must be burned, blown to bits, and then we can start afresh...\n1880s.\nStrindberg and Siri's daughter Karin was born on 26 February 1880. Buoyant from the reception of \"The Red Room\", Strindberg swiftly completed \"The Secret of the Guild\" (\"Gillets hemlighet\"), an historical drama set in Uppsala at the beginning of the 15th century about the conflict between two masons over the completion of the city cathedral, which opened at the Royal Theatre on 3 May 1880 (his first premi\u00e8re in nine years); Siri played the \"staunchly loyal\" Margaretha. That spring he formed a friendship with the painter Carl Larsson. A collected edition of all of Strindberg's previous writings was published under the title \"Spring Harvest\". From 1881, at the invitation of Edvard Brandes, Strindberg began to contribute articles to the \"Morgenbladet\", a Copenhagen daily newspaper. In April he began work on \"The Swedish People\", a four-part cultural history of Sweden written as a series of depictions of ordinary people's lives from the 9th century onwards, which he undertook mainly for financial reasons and which absorbed him for the next year; Larsson provided illustrations. At Strindberg's insistence, Siri resigned from the Royal Theatre in the spring, having become pregnant again. Their second daughter, Greta, was born on 9 June 1881, while they were staying on the island of Kymmend\u00f6. That month, a collection of essays from the past 10 years, \"Studies in Cultural History\", was published. Ludvig Josephson (the new artistic director of Stockholm's New Theatre) agreed to stage \"Master Olof\", eventually opting for the prose version \u2013 the five-hour-long production opened on 30 December 1881 under the direction of August Lindberg to favourable reviews. While this production of \"Master Olof\" was his breakthrough in the theatre, Strindberg's five-act fairy-tale play \"Lucky Peter's Journey\", which opened on 22 December 1883, brought him his first significant success, although he dismissed it as a potboiler. In March 1882 he wrote in a letter to Josephson: \"My interest in the theatre, I must frankly state, has but one focus and one goal \u2013 my wife's career as an actress\"; Josephson duly cast her in two roles the following season.\nHaving returned to Kymmend\u00f6 during the summer of 1882, Strindberg wrote a collection of anti-establishment short stories, \"The New Kingdom\". While there, to provide a lead role for his wife and as a reply to Henrik Ibsen's \"A Doll's House\" (1879), he also wrote \"Sir Bengt's Wife\", which opened on 25 November 1882 at the New Theatre. He moved to Grez-sur-Loing, just south of Paris, France, where Larsson was staying. He then moved to Paris, which they found noisy and polluted. Income earned from \"Lucky Peter's Journey\" enabled him to move to Switzerland in 1883. He resided in Ouchy, where he stayed for some years. On 3 April 1884, Siri gave birth to their son, Hans.\nIn 1884 Strindberg wrote a collection of short stories, \"Getting Married\", that presented women in an egalitarian light and for which he was tried for and acquitted of blasphemy in Sweden. Two groups \"led by influential members of the upper classes, supported by the right-wing press\" probably instigated the prosecution; at the time, most people in Stockholm thought that Queen Sophia was behind it. By the end of that year Strindberg was in a despondent mood: \"My view now is,\" he wrote, \"everything is shit. No way out. The skein is too tangled to be unravelled. It can only be sheared. The building is too solid to be pulled down. It can only be blown up.\" In May 1885 he wrote: \"I am on my way to becoming an atheist.\" In the wake of the publication of \"Getting Married\", he began to correspond with \u00c9mile Zola. During the summer he completed a sequel volume of stories, though some were quite different in tone from those of the first. Another collection of stories, \"Utopias in Reality\", was published in September 1885, though it was not well received.\nIn 1885, they moved back to Paris. In September 1887 he began to write a novel in French about his relationship with Siri von Essen called \"The Defence of a Fool\". In 1887, they moved to Issigatsb\u00fchl, near Lindau by Lake Constance. His next play, \"Comrades\" (1886), was his first in a contemporary setting. After the trial he evaluated his religious beliefs, and concluded that he needed to leave Lutheranism, though he had been Lutheran since childhood; and after briefly being a deist, he became an atheist. He needed a credo and he used Jean-Jacques Rousseau nature worshiping, which he had studied while a student, as one. His works \"The People of Hems\u00f6\" (1887) and \"Among French Peasants\" (1889) were influenced by his study of Rousseau. He then moved to Germany, where he fell in love with Chancellor Otto von Bismarck's Prussia status of the officer corps. After that, he grew very critical of Rousseau and turned to Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophies, which emphasized the male intellect. Nietzsche's influence can be seen in \"The Defence of a Fool\" (1893), \"Pariah\" (1889), \"Creditors\" (1889), and \"By the Open Sea\" (1890).\nAnother change in his life after the trial is that Strindberg decided he wanted a scientific life instead of a literary one, and began to write about non-literary subjects. When he was 37, he began \"The Son of a Servant\", a four-part autobiography. The first part ends in 1867, the year he left home for Uppsala. Part two describes his youth up to 1872. Part three, or \"The Red Room\", describes his years as a poet and journalist; it ends with his meeting Siri von Essen. Part four, which dealt with the years from 1877 to 1886, was banned by his publishers and was not published until after his death. The three missing years, 1875\u20131877, were the time when Strindberg was wooing von Essen and their marriage; entitled \"He and She\", this portion of his autobiography was not printed until 1919, after his death. It contains the love letters between the two during that period.\nIn the later half of the 1880s Strindberg discovered Naturalism. After completing \"The Father\" in a matter of weeks, he sent a copy to \u00c9mile Zola for his approval, though Zola's reaction was lukewarm. The drama revolves around the conflict between the Captain, a father, husband, and scientist, and his wife, Laura, over the education of their only child, a fourteen-year-old daughter named Berta. Through unscrupulous means, Laura gets the Captain to doubt his fatherhood until he suffers a mental and physical collapse. While writing \"The Father\", Strindberg himself was experiencing marital problems and doubted the paternity of his children. He also suspected that Ibsen had based Hjalmar Ekdal in \"The Wild Duck\" (1884) on Strindberg because he felt that Ibsen viewed him as a weak and pathetic husband; he reworked the situation of Ibsen's play into a warfare between the two sexes. From November 1887 to April 1889, Strindberg stayed in Copenhagen. While there he had several opportunities to meet with both Georg Brandes and his brother Edvard Brandes. Georg helped him put on \"The\u00a0Father\", which had its premi\u00e8re on 14\u00a0November 1887 at the Casino Theatre in Copenhagen. It enjoyed a successful run for 11 days after which it toured the Danish provinces.\nBefore writing \"Creditors\", Strindberg completed one of his most famous pieces, \"Miss Julie\". He wrote the play with a Parisian stage in mind, in particular the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Libre, founded in 1887 by Andr\u00e9 Antoine. In the play he used Charles Darwin's theory of survival of the fittest and dramatized a doomed sexual encounter that crosses the division of social classes. It is believed that this play was inspired by the marriage of Strindberg, the son of a servant, to an aristocratic woman.\nIn the essay \"On Psychic Murder\" (1887), he referred to the psychological theories of the Nancy School, which advocated the use of hypnosis. Strindberg developed a theory that sexual warfare was not motivated by carnal desire but by relentless human will. The winner was the one who had the strongest and most unscrupulous mind, someone who, like a hypnotist, could coerce a more impressionable psyche into submission. His view on psychological power struggles may be seen in works such as \"Creditors\" (1889), \"The Stronger\" (1889), and \"Pariah\" (1889).\nIn 1888, after a separation and reconciliation with Siri von Essen, he founded the Scandinavian Experimental Theatre in Copenhagen, where Siri became manager. He asked writers to send him scripts, which he received from Herman Bang, Gustav Wied and Nathalia Larsen. Less than a year later, with the theatre and reconciliation short lived, he moved back to Sweden while Siri moved back to her native Finland with the children. While there, he rode out the final phase of the divorce and later used this agonizing ordeal for the basis of \"The Bond and the Link\" (1893). Strindberg also became interested in short drama, called Quart d'heure. He was inspired by writers such as Gustave Guiche and Henri de Lavedan. His notable contribution was \"The Stronger\" (1889). As a result of the failure of the Scandinavian Experimental Theatre, Strindberg did not work as a playwright for three years. In 1889, he published an essay entitled \"On Modern Drama and the Modern Theatre\", in which he disassociated himself from naturalism, arguing that it was petty and unimaginative realism. His sympathy for Nietzsche's philosophy and atheism in general was also on the wane. He entered the period of his \"Inferno crisis\", in which he had psychological and religious upheavals that influenced his later works.\nAugust Strindberg's \"Inferno\" is his personal account of sinking deeper into some kind of madness, typified by visions and paranoia. In \"Strindberg och alkoholen\" (1985), James Spens discusses Strindberg's drinking habits, including his liking for absinthe and its possible implications for Strindberg's mental health during the inferno period.\n1890s.\nOn midsummer's day, 1891, while staying with Siri and her close friend, the Danish woman Marie Caroline David, on the island Runmar\u00f6, in the Stockholm Archipelago, Strindberg suspected Siri was having a long-term affair with David, and he violently assaulted her, precipitating the end of the marriage.\nAfter his disenchantment with naturalism, Strindberg had a growing interest in transcendental matters. Symbolism was just beginning at this time. Verner von Heidenstam and Ola Hanson had dismissed naturalism as \"shoemaker realism\" that rendered human experience in simplistic terms. This is believed to have stalled Strindberg's creativity, and Strindberg insisted that he was in a rivalry and forced to defend naturalism, even though he had exhausted its literary potential. These works include: \"Debit and Credit\" (1892), \"Facing Death\" (1892), \"Motherly Love\" (1892), and \"The First Warning\" (1893). His play \"The Keys of Heaven\" (1892) was inspired by the loss of his children in his divorce. He also completed one of his few comedies, \"Playing with Fire\" (1893), and the first two parts of his post-inferno trilogy \"To Damascus\" (1898\u20131904).\nIn 1892, he experienced writer's block, which led to a drastic reduction in his income. Depression followed as he was unable to meet his financial obligations and to support his children and former wife. A fund was set up through an appeal in a German magazine. This money allowed him to leave Sweden and he joined artistic circles in Berlin. Otto Brahm's Freie B\u00fchne theatre premiered some of his famous works in Germany, including \"The Father\", \"Miss Julie\", and \"Creditors\".\nSimilar to 20 years earlier when he frequented The Red Room, he now went to the German tavern The Black Porker. Here he met a diverse group of artists from Scandinavia, Poland, and Germany. His attention turned to Frida Uhl, who was twenty-three years younger than Strindberg. They were married in 1893. Less than a year later, their daughter Kerstin was born and the couple separated, though their marriage was not officially dissolved until 1897. Frida's family, in particular her mother, who was a devout Catholic, had an important influence on Strindberg, and in an 1894 letter he declared \"I feel the hand of our Lord resting over me.\"\nSome critics think that Strindberg suffered from severe paranoia in the mid-1890s, and perhaps that he temporarily experienced insanity. Others, including Evert Sprinchorn and Olof Lagercrantz, believed that he intentionally turned himself into his own guinea pig by doing psychological and drug-induced self-experimentation. He wrote on subjects such as botany, chemistry, and optics before returning to literature with the publication of \"Inferno\" (1897), a (half fictionalized) account of his \"wilderness years\" in Austria and Paris, then a collection of short stories, \"Legends\", and a semi-dramatic novella, \"Jacob Wrestling\" (both printed in the same book 1898). Both volumes aroused curiosity and controversy, not least due to the religious element; earlier, Strindberg had been known to be indifferent or hostile to religion and especially priests, but now he had undergone some sort of conversion to a personal faith. In a postscript, he noted the impact of Emanuel Swedenborg on his current work.\n\"The Powers\" were central to Strindberg's later work. He said that \"the Powers\" were an outside force that had caused him his physical and mental suffering because they were acting in retribution to humankind for their wrongdoings. As William Blake, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, and William Butler Yeats had been, he was drawn to Swedenborg's mystical visions, with their depictions of spiritual landscape and Christian morality. Strindberg believed for the rest of his life that the relationship between the transcendental and the real world was described by a series of \"correspondences\" and that everyday events were really messages from above of which only the enlightened could make sense. He also felt that he was chosen by Providence to atone for the moral decay of others and that his tribulations were payback for misdeeds earlier in his life.\nStrindberg had spent the tail end of 1896 and most of 1897 in the university town of Lund in southern Sweden, a sojourn during which he made a number of new friendships, felt his mental stability and health improving and also firmly returned to literary writing; \"Inferno, Legends\" and \"Jacob Wrestling\" were written there. In 1899, he returned permanently to Stockholm, following a successful production there of \"Master Olof\" in 1897 (which was re-staged in 1899 to mark Strindberg's fiftieth birthday). He had the desire to become recognized as a lead\u00edng figure in Swedish literature, and to put earlier controversies behind him, and felt that historical dramas were the way to attain that status. Though Strindberg claimed that he was writing \"realistically\", he freely altered past events and biographical information, and telescoped chronology (as often done in most historical fiction): more importantly, he felt a flow of resurgent inspiration, writing almost twenty new plays (many in a historical setting) between 1898 and 1902. His new works included the so-called Vasa Trilogy: \"The Saga of the Folkungs\" (1899), \"Gustavus Vasa\" (1899), and \"Erik XIV\" (1899) and \"A Dream Play\" (written in 1901, first performed in 1907).\n1900s.\nStrindberg was pivotal in the creation of chamber plays. Max Reinhardt was a big supporter of his, staging some of his plays at the Kleines Theatre in 1902 (including \"The Bond\", \"The Stronger\", and \"The Outlaw\"). Once Otto Brahm relinquished his role as head as of the Deutsches Theatre, Reinhardt took over and produced Strindberg's plays.\nIn 1903, Strindberg planned to write a grand cycle of plays based on world history, but the idea soon faded. He had completed short plays about Martin Luther, Plato, Moses, Jesus Christ, and Socrates. He wrote another historical drama in 1908 after the Royal Theatre convinced him to put on a new play for its sixtieth birthday. He wrote \"The Last of the Knights\" (1908), \"Earl Birger of Bj\u00e4lbo\" (1909), and \"The Regents\" (1909).\nHis other works, such as \"Days of Loneliness\" (1903), \"The Roofing Ceremony\" (1907), and \"The Scapegoat\" (1907), and the novels \"The Gothic Rooms\" (1904) and \"Black Banners Genre Scenes from the Turn of the Century\", (1907) have been viewed as precursors to Marcel Proust and Franz Kafka.\nAugust Falck, an actor, wanted to put on a production of \"Miss Julie\" and wrote to Strindberg for permission. In September 1906 he staged the first Swedish production of \"Miss Julie\". August Falck, played Jean and Manda Bjorling played Julie.\nIn 1909, Strindberg thought he might get the Nobel Prize in Literature, but instead lost to Selma Lagerl\u00f6f, the first woman and first Swede to win the award. The leader of the Social Democrat Youth Alliance started a fund-raiser for a special \"people's award\". Nathan S\u00f6derblom (friend of Strindberg since the mid-90s years in Paris, a prominent theologian and later to become archbishop of Sweden) was noted as a donor, and both he and Strindberg came under attack from circles close to the conservative party and the church. In total 45,000 Swedish crowns were collected, by more than 20,000 donors, most of whom were workers. Albert Bonniers f\u00f6rlag, who had already published much of his work over the years, paid him 200,000 Swedish crowns for the publishing rights to his complete works; the first volumes of the edition would appear in print in 1912, a few months before his death. He invited his first three children (now, like their mother, living in Finland) to Stockholm and divided the money into five shares, one for each child, one for Siri (absent), and the last one for himself. In setting apart one share for Siri, Strindberg noted, in a shy voice, \"This is for your mother - it's to settle an old debt\". When the children returned to Helsinki, Siri was surprised to hear that she had been included, but accepted the money and told them in a voice that was, according to her daughter Karin, both proud and moved, \"I shall accept it, receiving it as an old debt\". The debt was less financial than mental and emotional; Strindberg knew he had sometimes treated her unfairly during the later years of their marriage and at their divorce trial. In 1912, she would pass away only a few weeks before him.\nIn 1907, Strindberg co-founded The Intimate Theatre in Stockholm, together with the young actor and stage director August Falck. His theatre was modeled after Max Reinhardt's Kammerspiel Haus. Strindberg and Falck had the intention of the theatre being used for his plays and his plays only, Strindberg also wanted to try out a more chamber-oriented and sparse style of dramatic writing and production. In time for the theatre's opening, Strindberg wrote four chamber plays: \"Thunder in the Air, The Burned Site, The Ghost Sonata\", and \"The Pelican\"; these were generally not a success with audiences or newspaper critics at the time but have been highly influential on modern drama (and soon would reach wider audiences at Reinhardt's theatre in Berlin and other German stages). Strindberg had very specific ideas about how the theatre would be opened and operated. He drafted a series of rules for his theatre in a letter to August Falck:\n1. No liquor.\n2. No Sunday performances.\n3. Short performances without intermissions.\n4. No calls.\n5. Only 160 seats in the auditorium.\n6. No prompter. No orchestra, only music on stage.\n7. The text will be sold at the box office and in the lobby.\n8. Summer performances.\nFalck helped to design the auditorium, which was decorated in a deep-green tone. The ceiling lighting was a yellow silk cover which created an effect of mild daylight. The floor was covered with a deep-green carpet, and the auditorium was decorated by six ultra modern columns with elaborate up-to-date capitals. Instead of the usual restaurant Strindberg offered a lounge for the ladies and a smoking-room for the gentlemen. The stage was unusually small, only 6 by 9 metres. The small stage and minimal number of seats was meant to give the audience a greater feeling of involvement in the work. Unlike most theatres at this time, the Intima Teater was not a place in which people could come to socialize. By setting up his rules and creating an intimate atmosphere, Strindberg was able to demand the audience's focus. When the theatre opened in 1907 with a performance of \"The Pelican\" it was a rather large hit. Strindberg used a minimal technique, as was his way, by only having a back drop and some sea shells on the stage for scene design and props. Strindberg was much more concerned with the actors portraying the written word than the stage looking pretty.\nThe theatre ran into a financial difficulty in February 1908 and Falck had to borrow money from Prince Eugen, Duke of N\u00e4rke, who attended the premi\u00e8re of \"The Pelican\". The theatre eventually went bankrupt in 1910, but did not close until Strindberg's death in 1912. The newspapers wrote about the theatre until its death.\nDeath and funeral.\nStrindberg died shortly after the first staging of one of his plays in the United States \u2014 \"The Father\" opened on 9 April 1912 at the Berkeley Theatre in New York, in a translation by painter and playwright Edith Gardener Shearn Oland and her husband actor Warner Oland. They jointly published their translations of his plays in book form in 1912.\nDuring Christmas 1911, Strindberg became sick with pneumonia and he never recovered completely. He also began to suffer more clearly from a stomach cancer (early signs of which had been felt in 1908). The final weeks of his life were painful. He had long since become a national celebrity, even if highly controversial, and when it became clear that he was seriously ill the daily papers in Stockholm began reporting on his health in every edition. He received many letters and telegrams from admirers across the country. He died on 14 May 1912 at the age of 63.\nStrindberg was interred at Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm. He had given strict instructions concerning his funeral and how his body should be treated after death: only members of his immediate family were allowed to view his body, there would be no autopsy, no photographs were taken, and no death mask was made. Strindberg had also requested that his funeral should take place as soon as possible after his death to avoid crowds of onlookers. However, the workers' organisations requested that the funeral should take place on a Sunday to make it possible for working men to pay their respects, and the funeral was postponed for five days, until Sunday, 19 May. According to Strindberg's last wish, the funeral procession was to start at 8am, again to avoid crowds, but large groups of people were nevertheless waiting outside his home as well as at the cemetery, as early as 7am. A short service was conducted by Nathan S\u00f6derblom by the bier in Strindberg's home, in the presence of three of Strindberg's children and his housekeeper, after which the coffin was taken outside for the funeral procession. The procession was followed by groups of students, workers, members of Parliament and a couple of cabinet ministers, and it was estimated that up to 60,000 people lined the streets. King Gustaf V sent a wreath for the bier.\nLegacy.\nTennessee Williams, Edward Albee, Maxim Gorky, John Osborne, and Ingmar Bergman are among the many artists who have cited Strindberg as an influence. Eugene O'Neill, upon receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature, dedicated much of his acceptance speech to describing Strindberg's influence on his work, and referred to him as \"that greatest genius of all modern dramatists.\" Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges said of Strindberg: \"[he] was, for a time, my god, alongside Nietzsche\".\nA multi-faceted author, Strindberg's novel \"The Red Room\" (1879) made him famous. His early plays belong to the Naturalistic movement. His works from this time are often compared with the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. Strindberg's best-known play from this period is \"Miss Julie\". Among his most widely read works is the novel \"The People of Hems\u00f6\".\nStrindberg wanted to attain what he called \"greater Naturalism\". He disliked the expository character backgrounds that characterise the work of Henrik Ibsen and rejected the convention of a dramatic \"slice of life\" because he felt that the resulting plays were mundane and uninteresting. Strindberg felt that true naturalism was a psychological \"battle of brains\": two people who hate each other in the immediate moment and strive to drive the other to doom is the type of mental hostility that Strindberg strove to describe. He intended his plays to be impartial and objective, citing a desire to make literature akin to a science.\nFollowing the inner turmoil that he experienced during the \"Inferno crisis\", he wrote an important book in French, \"Inferno\" (1896\u20137), in which he dramatised his experiences. He also exchanged a few cryptic letters with Friedrich Nietzsche.\nStrindberg subsequently ended his association with Naturalism and began to produce works informed by Symbolism. He is considered one of the pioneers of the modern European stage and Expressionism. \"The Dance of Death\", \"A Dream Play\", and \"The Ghost Sonata\" are well-known plays from this period.\nHis most famous and produced plays are \"Master Olof\", \"Miss Julie\", and \"The Father\".\nInternationally, Strindberg is chiefly remembered as a playwright, but in his native Sweden his name is associated no less with novels and other writings. \"R\u00f6da rummet\" (The Red Room), \"Hems\u00f6borna\" (The People of Hems\u00f6), \"Giftas\" (Getting Married), \"En d\u00e5res f\u00f6rsvarstal\" (The Confession of a Fool), and \"Inferno\" remain among his most celebrated novels, representing different genres and styles. He is often, though not universally, viewed as Sweden's greatest author, and taught in schools as a key figure of Swedish culture. The most important contemporary literary award in Sweden, Augustpriset, is named for Strindberg.\nThe Swedish composer Ture Rangstr\u00f6m dedicated his first Symphony, which was finished in 1914, to \"August Strindberg in memoriam\".\nSocial criticism.\nAn acerbic polemicist who was often vehemently opposed to conventional authority, Strindberg was difficult to pigeon-hole as a political figure. Through his long career, he penned scathing attacks on the military, the church, and the monarchy. For most of his public life, he was seen as a major figure on the literary left and a standard-bearer of cultural radicalism, but, especially from the 1890s, he espoused conservative and religious views that alienated many former supporters. He resumed his attacks on conservative society with great vigor in the years immediately preceding his death.\nStrindberg's opinions were typically stated with great force and vitriol, and sometimes humorously over-stated. He was involved in a variety of crises and feuds, skirmishing regularly with the literary and cultural establishment of his day, including erstwhile allies and friends. His youthful reputation as a genial \"enfant terrible\" of Swedish literature, transformed, eventually, into the role of a sort of ill-tempered towering giant of Swedish public life.\nStrindberg was a prolific letter-writer, whose private communications have been collected in several annotated volumes. He often voiced political views privately to friends and literary acquaintances, phrased in a no-holds-barred jargon of scathing attacks, drastic humor, and flippant hyperbole. Many of his most controversial political statements are drawn from this private correspondence.\nInfluenced by the history of the 1871 Paris Commune, the young Strindberg had embraced the view that politics was the art of the upper class to keep the lower class under itself. Early works like the \"Red Room\" or \"Master Olof\" took aim at public hypocrisy, royalty, and organized religion. He was, at this time, an outspoken socialist, mainly influenced by anarchist or libertarian socialist ideas. However, Strindberg's socialism was undogmatic and rooted in a ruthless critique of state, church, school, press, and economy in which he aimed at pitting the people against kings, economists, priests, and merchants. A small example from this period is his Little Catechism for the Underclass.\nHe read widely among progressive thinkers, including Cabet, Fourier, Babeuf, Saint-Simon, Proudhon, and Owen, whom he referred to as \"friends of humanity and sharp thinkers.\" \"Strindberg adopted ideas from everyone,\" writes Jan Olsson, who notes that Strindberg lived in a period where \"terms like anarchism, socialism, and communism were alternately used as synonyms and as different terms.\"\nBy the early 1880s, many young political and literary radicals in Sweden had come to view Strindberg as a champion of their causes. However, in contrast to the Marxist-influenced socialism then rising within the Swedish labor movement, Strindberg espoused an older type of agrarian radicalism accompanied by spiritual and even mystical ideas. His views remained as fluid and eclectic as they were uncompromising, and on certain issues he could be wildly out of step with the younger generation of socialists. To Martin Kylhammar, the young Strindberg \"was a 'reactionary radical' whose writing was populist and democratic but who persisted in an antiquated romanticizing of agrarian life.\"\nAlthough he had been an early proponent of women's rights, calling for women's suffrage in 1884, Strindberg later became disenchanted with what he viewed as an unnatural equation of the sexes. In times of personal conflict and marital trouble (which was much of the time), he could lash out with crudely misogynistic statements. His troubled marriage with Siri von Essen, ended in an upsetting divorce in 1891, became the inspiration for \"The Defence of a Fool\", begun in 1887 and published in 1893. Strindberg famously sought to insert a warning to lawmakers against \"granting citizens' rights to half-apes, lower beings, sick children, [who are] sick and crazed thirteen times a year during their periods, completely insane while pregnant, and irresponsible throughout the rest of their lives.\" The paragraph was ultimately removed before printing by his publisher.\nStrindberg's misogyny was at odds with the younger generation of socialist activists and has drawn attention in contemporary Strindberg scholarship. So has Strindberg's anti-Jewish rhetoric. Although particularly targeting Jewish enemies of his in Swedish cultural life, he also attacked Jews and Judaism as such. The antisemitic outbursts were particularly pronounced in the early 1880s, when Strindberg dedicated an entire chapter (\"Moses\") in a work of social and political satire, \"Det nya riket\", dedicated to heckling Swedish Jews (including an unflattering portrayal of Albert Bonnier). Although anti-Jewish prejudice was far from uncommon in wider society in the 1880s, Jan Myrdal notes that \"the entire liberal and democratic intelligentsia of the time distanced themselves from the older, left-wing antisemitism of August Strindberg.\" Yet, as with many things, Strindberg's opinions and passions shifted with time. In the mid-1880s he toned down and then mostly ended his anti-Jewish rhetoric, after publicly declaring himself not to be an anti-Semite in 1884.\nA self-declared atheist in his younger years, Strindberg would also re-embrace Christianity, without necessarily making his peace with the church. As noted by Stockholm's Strindberg Museum, the personal and spiritual crisis that Strindberg underwent in Paris in the 1890s, which prompted the writing of \"Inferno\", had aesthetic as well as philosophical and political implications: \"Before the Inferno crisis (1869 \u2013 92), Strindberg was influenced by anarchism, Rousseau, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche; in the years after the crisis (1897 \u2013 1911) he was influenced by Swedenborg, Goethe, Shakespeare, and Beethoven.\"\nIn \"Inferno\", Strindberg notes his ideological and spiritual evolution:\n What is the purpose of having toiled through thirty years only to gain, through experience, that which I had already understood as a concept? In my youth, I was a sincere believer, and you [i.e. the powers that be] have made me a free-thinker. Out of a free-thinker you have made me an atheist; out of an atheist, a religious believer. Inspired by humanitarian ideas, I have praised socialism. Five years later, you have proven to me the unreasonableness of socialism. Everything that once enthralled me you have invalidated! And presuming that I will now abandon myself to religion, I am certain that you will, in ten years, disprove religion. (Strindberg, \"Inferno\", Chapter XV.) \nDespite his reactionary attitudes on issues such as women's rights and his conservative, mystical turn from the early 1890s, Strindberg remained popular with some in the socialist-liberal camp on the strength of his past radicalism and his continued salience as a literary modernizer. However, several former admirers were disappointed and troubled by what they viewed as Strindberg's descent into religious conservatism and, perhaps, madness. His former ally and friend, Social Democrat leader Hjalmar Branting, now dismissed the author as a \"disaster\" who had betrayed his past ideals for a reactionary, mystical elitism. In 1909, Branting remarked on Strindberg's shifting political and cultural posture, on the occasion of the author's sixtieth birthday:\n To the young Strindberg, the trail-blazer, the rouser from sleep, let us offer all our praise and admiration. To the writer in a more mature age [let us offer] a place of rank on the Aeropagus of European erudition. But to the Strindberg of \"Black Banners\" [1907] and \"A Blue Book\" [1907-1912], who, in the shadows of \"Inferno\" [1898] has been converted to a belief in the sickly, empty gospels of mysticism \u2013 let us wish, from our hearts, that he may once again become his past self. (Hjalmar Branting, in \"Social-Demokraten\", 22 January 1909.) \nToward the end of his life, however, Strindberg would dramatically reassert his role as a radical standard-bearer and return to the good graces of progressive Swedish opinion.\nIn April 1910, Strindberg launched a series of unprompted, insult-laden attacks on popular conservative symbols, viciously thrashing the nationalist cult of former king Charles XII (\"pharao worship\"), the lauded poet Verner von Heidenstam (\"the spirit-seer of Djursholm\"), and the famous author and traveler Sven Hedin (\"the humbug explorer\"). The ensuing debate, known as \"Strindbergsfejden\" or \"The Strindberg Feud\", is one of the most significant literary debates in Swedish history. It came to comprise about a thousand articles by various authors across some eighty newspapers, raging for two years until Strindberg's death in 1912. The Feud served to revive Strindberg's reputation as an implacable enemy of bourgeois tastes, while also reestablishing beyond doubt his centrality to Swedish culture and politics. In 1912, Strindberg's funeral was co-organized by Branting\u00a0and heavily attended by members of the Swedish labor movement, with \"more than 100 red banners\" in attendance alongside the entire Social Democrat parliamentary contingent.\nStrindberg's daughter Karin Strindberg married a Russian Bolshevik of partially Swedish ancestry, Vladimir Smirnov (\"Paulsson\").\nPainting.\nStrindberg, something of a polymath, was also a telegrapher, theosophist, painter, photographer and alchemist.\nPainting and photography offered vehicles for his belief that chance played a crucial part in the creative process.\nStrindberg's paintings were unique for their time, and went beyond those of his contemporaries for their radical lack of adherence to visual reality. The 117 paintings that are acknowledged as his were mostly painted within the span of a few years, and are now seen by some as among the most original works of 19th-century art.\nToday, his best-known pieces are stormy, expressionist seascapes, selling at high prices in auction houses. Though Strindberg was friends with Edvard Munch and Paul Gauguin, and was thus familiar with modern trends, the spontaneous and subjective expressiveness of his landscapes and seascapes can be ascribed also to the fact that he painted only in periods of personal crisis. Anders Zorn also did a portrait.\nPhotography.\nStrindberg's interest in photography resulted, among other things, in a large number of arranged self-portraits in various environments, which now number among the best-known pictures of him. Strindberg also embarked on a series of camera-less images, using an experimental quasi-scientific approach. He produced a type of photogram that encouraged the development and growth of crystals on the photographic emulsion, sometimes exposed for lengthy periods to heat or cold in the open air or at night facing the stars. The suggestiveness of these, which he called Celestographs, provided an object for contemplation, and he noted;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Today, in these days of x-rays, the miracle was that neither a camera nor a lens was used. For me this means a great opportunity to demonstrate the real circumstances by means of my photographs made without a camera and lens, recording the firmament in early spring 1894.\nHis interest in the occult in the 1890s finds sympathy with the chance quality of these images, but for him they are also scientific.\nIn 1895 Strindberg met Camille Flammarion and became a member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 astronomique de France. He gave some of his experimental astronomical photographs to the Society.\nOccult studies.\nAlchemy, occultism, Swedenborgianism, and various other eccentric interests were pursued by Strindberg with some intensity for periods of his life.\nIn the curious and experimental 1897 work \"Inferno\" \u2013 a dark, paranoid, and confusing tale of his time in Paris, written in French, which takes the form of an autobiographical journal \u2013 Strindberg, as the narrator, claims to have successfully performed alchemical experiments and cast black magic spells on his daughter. Much of \"Inferno\" indicates that the author suffered from paranoid delusions, as he writes of being stalked through Paris, haunted by evil forces, and targeted with mind-altering electric rays emitted by an \"infernal machine\" covertly installed in his hotel. It remains unclear to what extent the book represents a genuine attempt at autobiography or exaggerates for literary effect. Olof Lagercrantz has suggested that Strindberg staged and imagined elements of the crisis as material for his literary production.\nPersonal life.\nStrindberg was married three times, as follows:\nStrindberg was age 28 and Siri was 27 at the time of their marriage. He was 44 and Frida was 21 when they married, and he was 52 and Harriet was 23 when they married. Late during his life he met the young actress and painter Fanny Falkner (1890\u20131963) who was 41 years younger than Strindberg. She wrote a book which illuminates his last years, but the exact nature of their relationship is debated. He had a brief affair in Berlin with Dagny Juel before his marriage to Frida; it has been suggested that the news of her murder in 1901 was the reason he cancelled his honeymoon with his third wife, Harriet.\nHe was related to Nils Strindberg (a son of one of August's cousins).\nStrindberg's relationships with women were troubled and have often been interpreted as misogynistic by contemporaries and modern readers. Marriage and families were under stress in Strindberg's lifetime as Sweden industrialized and urbanized at a rapid pace. Problems of prostitution and poverty were debated among writers, critics and politicians. His early writing often dealt with the traditional roles of the sexes imposed by society, which he criticized as unjust.\nStrindberg's last home was Bl\u00e5 tornet in central Stockholm, where he lived from 1908 until 1912. It is now a museum, known as the Strindberg Museum, which is open to visitors. It contains numerous of Strindberg's personal possessions including his piano.\nOf several statues and busts of him erected in Stockholm, the most prominent is Carl Eldh's, erected in 1942 in Tegn\u00e9rlunden, a park adjoining this house.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Sophists specialized in one or more subject areas, such as philosophy, rhetoric, music, athletics and mathematics. They taught \"arete\", \"virtue\" or \"excellence\", predominantly to young statesmen and nobility.\nThe arts of the sophists were known as sophistry and gained a negative reputation as tools of arbitrary reasoning. Protagoras, regarded as the first of the sophists, became notorious for his claim to \"make the weaker argument the stronger\".\nIn modern usage, \"sophism\", \"sophist\", and \"sophistry\" are used disparagingly. Sophistry, or a sophism, is a fallacious argument, especially one used deliberately to deceive. A sophist is a person who reasons with clever but deceptive or intellectually dishonest arguments.\nEtymology.\nThe Greek word is related to the noun . Since the times of Homer, it commonly referred to an expert in his profession or craft. Charioteers, sculptors, or military experts could be referred to as in their occupations. The word has gradually come to connote general wisdom and especially wisdom in human affairs such as politics, ethics, and household management. This was the meaning ascribed to the Greek Seven Sages of 7th and 6th century BC (such as Solon and Thales), and it was the meaning that appears in the histories of Herodotus.\nThe word gives rise to the verb , the passive voice of which means \"to become or be wise\", or \"to be clever or skilled\". From the verb is derived the noun , which originally meant \"a master of one's craft\" and later \"a prudent man\" or \"wise man\". The word for \"sophist\" in various languages comes from .\nThe word \"sophist\" could be combined with other Greek words to form compounds. Examples include \"meteorosophist\", which roughly translates to \"expert in celestial phenomena\"; \"gymnosophist\" (or \"naked sophist\", a word used to refer to Indian philosophers), \"deipnosophist\" or \"dinner sophist\" (as in the title of Athenaeus's ), and \"iatrosophist\", a type of physician in the later Roman period.\nHistory.\nIn the second half of the 5th century BC, particularly in Athens, \"sophist\" came to denote a class of mostly itinerant intellectuals who taught courses in various subjects, speculated about the nature of language and culture, and employed rhetoric to achieve their purposes, generally to persuade or convince others. Nicholas Denyer observes that the Sophists \"did ... have one important thing in common: whatever else they did or did not claim to know, they characteristically had a great understanding of what words would entertain or impress or persuade an audience.\" Sophists went to Athens to teach because the city was flourishing at the time. It was good employment for those good at debate, which was a speciality of the first sophists, and they received the fame and fortune they were seeking. Protagoras is generally regarded as the first of these professional sophists. Others include Gorgias, Prodicus, Hippias, Thrasymachus, Lycophron, Callicles, Antiphon, and Cratylus. A few sophists claimed that they could find the answers to all questions. Most of these sophists are known today primarily through the writings of their opponents (particularly Plato and Aristotle), which makes it difficult to assemble an unbiased view of their practices and teachings. In some cases, such as Gorgias, original rhetorical works are extant, allowing the author to be judged on his own terms, but in most cases, knowledge about what individual sophists wrote or said comes from fragmentary quotations that lack context and are usually hostile.\nThe Greeks were \"experimenting with a new form of government, democracy\" (W. Keith, 5). Therefore, they were navigating how to make decisions without a higher authority. They needed to create laws based on demand and popular vote of the people. Back in the fifth century they did not have mass media, printing presses, and barely any texts. They mostly relied on speech. This meant that \"the Athenians needed a strategy for effectively talking to other people in juries, in forums, and in the senate\" (W. Keith, 5). This is when the sophist began to come about. Originally known as Sicilians, they began to teach Athenians how to speak in a persuasive manner in order to work with the courts and senate. It is not really known how these Sicilians, who came to be Sophists, initially grew an interest to teach others how to speak persuasively. However, the interest in receiving training from the Sophists increased. \nSophists could be described both as teachers and philosophers, having travelled about in Greece teaching their students various life skills, particularly rhetoric and public speaking. These were useful qualities of the time, during which persuasive ability had a large influence on one's political power and economic wealth. Athens became the center of the sophists' activity, due to the city's freedom of speech for non-slave citizens and its wealth of resources. The sophists as a group had no set teachings, and they lectured on subjects that were as diverse as semantics and rhetoric, to ontology, and epistemology. Most sophists claimed to teach \"arete\" (\"excellence\" or \"virtue\") in the management and administration of not only one's affairs, but the city's as well. Before the 5th century BC, it was believed that aristocratic birth qualified a person for arete and politics. However, Protagoras, who is regarded as the first sophist, argued that arete was the result of training rather than birth.\nMajor figures.\nMost of what is known about sophists comes from commentaries from others. In some cases, such as Gorgias, some of his works survive, allowing the author to be judged on his own terms. In one case, the Dissoi logoi, an important sophist text survived but knowledge of its author has been lost. However, most knowledge of sophist thought comes from fragmentary quotations that lack context. Many of these quotations come from Aristotle, who seems to have held the sophists in slight regard.\nProtagoras.\nProtagoras was one of the best known and most successful sophists of his era; however, some later philosophers, such as Sextus Empiricus treat him as a founder of a philosophy rather than as a sophist. Protagoras taught his students the necessary skills and knowledge for a successful life, particularly in politics. He trained his pupils to argue from both points of view because he believed that truth could not be limited to just one side of the argument. Protagoras wrote about a variety of subjects and advanced several philosophical ideas, particularly in epistemology. Some fragments of his works have survived. He is the author of the famous saying, \"Man is the measure of all things\", which is the opening sentence of a work called \"Truth\".\nXeniades.\nXeniades was a skeptical philosopher from Corinth, probably a follower of the pre-Socratic Xenophanes. There may have been two such persons, as he is referenced by Democritus c. 400 BC, though he was also supposedly the purchaser of Diogenes the Cynic c. 350 BC, when he was captured by pirates and sold as a slave. Xeniades was supposed to have been the man who persuaded Monimus to become a follower of Diogenes, and was the source of his skeptical doctrines. The little that is known of him is derived from Sextus Empiricus, who represents him as holding the most ultrasceptical opinions, and maintaining that all notions are false, and that there is absolutely nothing true in the universe. He more than once couples him with Xenophanes.\nGorgias.\nGorgias was a well-known sophist whose writings showcased his ability to make counter-intuitive and unpopular positions appear stronger. Gorgias authored a lost work known as \"On the Non-Existent\", which argues that nothing exists. In it, he attempts to persuade his readers that thought and existence are different. He also wrote \"Encomium of Helen\" in which he presents all of the possible reasons for which Helen could be blamed for causing the Trojan War and refutes each one of them.\nLycophron.\nLycophron is mentioned as a sophist by Aristotle, and was probably among the students of Gorgias. He rejected the supposed value of an aristocratic birth, claiming that \"Now the nobility of good birth is obscure, and its grandeur a matter of words.\" meaning that there is no factual difference between those well-born and those low-born; only words and opinion assign value to these different circumstances of birth. This statement may indicate that Lycophron shared the beliefs of Antiphon, that (regardless of their ancestry) both Greeks and barbarians are born with the same capacities: An egalitarian belief that was a minority view in the 5th century BC. He is also known for his statement (reproduced by Aristotle, in the latter's \"Politics\", 1280b10), that \"law is only a convention, a surety to another of justice\"., also translated as \"a guarantor of men's rights against one another\". He, thus, believed that law is a matter of agreement, a social convention and not a natural or universal standard (there is no evidence that Lycophron rejected the idea that law is a universal standard \u2013 indeed his view appears far more universalist than that of Aristotle, in that Lycophron proposes a single standard, what would now be called the non aggression principle, in relation to all states). In this respect his views on law are similar to those of Protagoras. This means that he treats law as a mere means, in the context of a (perhaps primitive) social contract theory, without considering it as something special, in contradistinction to, e.g., Plato but similar to both Thrasymachus and Callicles, albeit that their theories have \u2013 as far as can be ascertained from the information available about them \u2013 more specific characteristics.\nCriticism.\nMany sophists taught their skills for a price. Due to the importance of such skills in the litigious social life of Athens, practitioners often commanded very high fees. The sophists' practice of questioning the existence and roles of traditional deities and investigating into the nature of the heavens and the earth prompted a popular reaction against them. As there was a popular view of Socrates as a sophist, he was among the targets (which prompted a vigorous condemnation from his followers, including Plato and Xenophon). For example, in the comic play \"The Clouds\", Aristophanes criticizes the sophists as hairsplitting wordsmiths, and makes Socrates their representative. Such criticism, coupled with the wealth garnered by many sophist practitioners, eventually led to popular resentment against sophists and the ideas and writings associated with sophism.\nAristophanes.\nThe comic playwright Aristophanes, a contemporary of the sophists, criticized the sophists as hairsplitting wordsmiths. Aristophanes, however, made no distinction between sophists and philosophers, and showed either of them as willing to argue any position for the right fee. In Aristophanes's comedic play \"The Clouds\", Strepsiades seeks the help of Socrates (a parody of the actual philosopher) in an effort to avoid paying his debts. In the play, Socrates promises to teach Strepsiades' son to argue his way out of paying his debts.\nSocrates.\nAn ongoing debate is centered on the difference between the sophists, who charged for their services, and Socrates, who did not. Instead of giving instruction Socrates professed a self-effacing and questioning posture, exemplified by what is known as the Socratic method (although Diogenes La\u00ebrtius wrote that Protagoras, a sophist, invented this method). Socrates' attitude towards the sophists was not entirely oppositional. In one dialogue Socrates even stated that the sophists were better educators than he was, which he validated by sending one of his students to study under a sophist. W. K. C. Guthrie classified Socrates as a sophist in his \"History of Greek Philosophy\".\nIsocrates.\nOne of the few speeches that have survived from ancient Greece is Isocrates' \"Against the Sophists.\" The speech offers scathing criticisms against sophist teachers and their failures.\nWhile a sophist himself, Isocrates sought to distinguish his school's pedagogical focus from other sophistic teachings. In particular, Isocrates wanted to establish an institution that educated Athenian students in a manner that would promote the success of Athenian democracy. By developing a school in Athens around 392 BC, approximately five years after Plato opened his Platonic Academy, Isocrates gave sophism more credibility in society.\nPlato.\nAs only small portions of the sophists' writings have survived they are mainly known through the works of Plato. Plato's dialogues present a generally hostile view on the sophists' thought, which is largely responsible for the modern view of the sophist as an avaricious instructor that teaches deception.\nBefore Plato, the word \"sophist\" could be used as either a respectful or contemptuous title. It was in Plato's dialogue, \"Sophist\", that the first record of an attempt to answer the question \"what is a sophist?\" is made. Plato described sophists as paid hunters after the young and wealthy, as merchants of knowledge, as athletes in a contest of words, and purgers of souls. From Plato's assessment of sophists it could be concluded that sophists do not offer true knowledge, but only an opinion of things. Plato describes them as shadows of the true, saying, \"the art of contradiction making, descended from an insincere kind of conceited mimicry, of the semblance-making breed, derived from image making, distinguished as portion, not divine but human, of production, that presents, a shadow play of words\u2014such are the blood and the lineage which can, with perfect truth, be assigned to the authentic sophist\". Plato sought to distinguish sophists from philosophers, arguing that a sophist was a person who made his living through deception, whereas a philosopher was a lover of wisdom who sought the truth. To give the philosophers greater credence, Plato gave the sophists a negative connotation.\nPlato depicts Socrates as refuting sophists in several dialogues. These texts often depict the sophists in an unflattering light, and it is unclear how accurate or fair Plato's representation of them may be; however, Protagoras and Prodicus are portrayed in a largely positive light in \"Protagoras.\" Protagoras argued that \"man is the measure of all things\", meaning man decides for himself what he is going to believe. The works of Plato and Aristotle have had much influence on the modern view of the \"sophist\" as a greedy instructor who uses rhetorical sleight-of-hand and ambiguities of language in order to deceive, or to support fallacious reasoning. In this view, the sophist is not concerned with truth and justice, but instead seeks power.\nSome scholars, such as Ugo Zilioli argue that the sophists held a relativistic view on cognition and knowledge. However, this may involve the Greek word \"doxa\", which means \"culturally shared belief\" rather than \"individual opinion\". The sophists' philosophy contains criticisms of religion, law, and ethics. Although many sophists were apparently as religious as their contemporaries, some held atheistic or agnostic views (for example, Protagoras and Diagoras of Melos).\nInfluence.\nFew writings from and about the first sophists survive. The early sophists charged money in exchange for education and providing wisdom, and so were typically employed by wealthy people. This practice resulted in the condemnations made by Plato through Socrates in his dialogues, as well as by Xenophon in his \"Memorabilia\" and, somewhat controversially, by Aristotle. As a paid tutor to Alexander the Great, Aristotle could be accused of being a sophist. Aristotle did not actually accept payment from Philip, Alexander's father, but requested that Philip reconstruct Aristotle's home town of Stageira as payment, which Philip had destroyed in a previous campaign, terms which Philip accepted. James A. Herrick wrote: \"In \"De Oratore\", Cicero blames Plato for separating wisdom and eloquence in the philosopher's famous attack on the sophists in \"Gorgias\".\" Through works such as these, sophists were portrayed as \"specious\" or \"deceptive\", hence the modern meaning of the term.\nDemocracy.\nThe sophists' rhetorical techniques were useful for any young nobleman seeking public office. The societal roles the sophists filled had important ramifications for the Athenian political system. The historical context provides evidence for their considerable influence, as Athens became more and more democratic during the period in which the sophists were most active.\nEven though Athens was already a flourishing democracy before their arrival, the cultural and psychological contributions of the sophists played an important role in the growth of Athenian democracy. Sophists contributed to the new democracy in part by espousing expertise in public deliberation, the foundation of decision-making, which allowed\u2014and perhaps required\u2014a tolerance of the beliefs of others. This liberal attitude would naturally have made its way into the Athenian assembly as sophists began acquiring increasingly high-powered clients. Continuous rhetorical training gave the citizens of Athens \"the ability to create accounts of communal possibilities through persuasive speech\". This was important for the democracy, as it gave disparate and sometimes superficially unattractive views a chance to be heard in the Athenian assembly.\nIn addition, sophists had a great impact on the early development of law, as the sophists were the first lawyers in the world. Their status as lawyers was a result of their highly developed skills in argument.\nEducation.\nAthens.\nThe sophists were the first formal teachers of the art of speaking and writing in the Western world. Their influence on education in general, and medical education in particular, has been described by Seamus Mac Suibhne. The sophists \"offer quite a different epistemic field from that mapped by Aristotle\", according to scholar Susan Jarratt, writer of \".\"\nFor the sophists, the science of eloquence became a method to earn money. In order to teach their students the art of persuasion and demonstrate their thoughts, they focused on two techniques: dialectics and rhetoric. The sophists taught their students two main techniques: the usage of sophisms and contradictions. These means distinguished the speeches of the sophists from the other speakers. Contradictions (antithesis ) were important to the Sophists because they believed that a good rhetorician should be able to defend both his own opinion and the exact opposite one. In this way, was developed the ability to find clear, convincing arguments for any thesis. For the sophists, the primary purpose was to win the dispute in order to prove their excellence in word usage. They were convinced that there was no verity, but there were different opinions, equal in importance, and the \"verity\" was the only one that would be more convincingly demonstrated by the rhetorician.\nSophists were not limited in their speeches only to topics in which they were aware. For them, there were no topics they could not dispute, because their skill reached such a level that they were able to talk about completely unknown things to them and still impress upon listeners and the opponent. The main purpose was to pick an approach to the audience, to please it and to adapt the speech to it. Unlike Plato's approach, the Sophist rhetoricians did not focus on identifying the truth, but the most important thing for them was to prove their case.\nThe first sophist whose speeches are a perfect example of a sophisticated approach is Gorgias. One of his most famous speeches is the \"Praise of Helen\", which has made a significant contribution to rhetorical art. In this speech, Gorgias aims to make something almost impossible \u2013 to justify Helen, about whom the people have already had a negative opinion. By methods of double oppositions, stringing of repetitive positive qualities and insightful consistent arguments, Gorgias gradually purifies the poor reputation of a woman. Later, Aristotle described the means used in Gorgias' speech as \"Gorgias figures\". All of these figures create the most accessible path for the audience to the argument offered, varying depending on the type of speech and audience.\nRome.\nThe classical tradition of rhetoric and composition refers more to philosophers such as Aristotle, Cicero, and Quintilian than to the sophists. Owing largely to the influence of Plato and Aristotle, philosophy came to be regarded as distinct from sophistry, the latter being regarded as specious and rhetorical, a practical discipline. Thus, by the time of the Roman Empire, a sophist was simply a teacher of rhetoric and a popular public speaker. For instance, Libanius, Himerius, Aelius Aristides, and Fronto were sophists in this sense. However, despite the opposition from philosophers Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, it is clear that sophists had a vast influence on a number of spheres, including the growth of knowledge and on ethical-political theory. Their teachings had a huge influence on thought in the 5th century BC. The sophists focused on the rational examination of human affairs and the betterment and success of human life. They argued that gods could not be the explanation of human action.\nMany rhetoricians during this period were instructed under specialists in Greek rhetorical studies as part of their standard education. Cicero, a prominent rhetorician during this period in Roman history, is one such example of the influence of the Second Sophistic on Roman education. His early life coincided with the suppression of Latin rhetoric in Roman education under the edicts of Crassus and Domitius. Cicero was instructed in Greek rhetoric throughout his youth, as well as in other subjects of the Roman rubric under Archias. Cicero benefited in his early education from favorable ties to Crassus.\nIn his writings, Cicero is said to have shown a \"synthesis that he achieved between Greek and Roman culture\" summed up in his work \"De Oratore. \"Despite his oratorical skill, Cicero pressed for a more liberal education in Roman instruction which focused more in the broad sciences including Roman history. He entitled this set of sciences as \"politior humanitas\" (2.72). Regardless of his efforts toward this end, Greek history was still preferred by the majority of aristocratic Romans during this time.\nFrom the late 1st century CE the Second Sophistic, a philosophical and rhetorical movement, was the chief expression of intellectual life. The term \"Second Sophistic\" comes from Philostratus, who, rejecting the term \"New Sophistic\", traced the beginnings of the movement to the orator Aeschines in the 4th century BC. But its earliest representative was really Nicetes of Smyrna, in the late 1st century CE. Unlike the original Sophistic movement of the 5th century BC, the Second Sophistic was little concerned with politics. But it was, to a large degree, to meet the everyday needs and respond to the practical problems of Greco-Roman society. It came to dominate higher education and left its mark on many forms of literature. Lucian, himself a writer of the Second Sophistic, even calls Jesus \"that crucified sophist\".\nDuring the Second Sophistic, the Greek discipline of rhetoric heavily influenced Roman education. During this time Latin rhetorical studies were banned for the precedent of Greek rhetorical studies. In addition, Greek history was preferred for educating the Roman elites above that of their native Roman history.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During his tenure on \"SNL\", he appeared in a recurring series of sketches, including the Coneheads and the Blues Brothers. For his work on the show, he received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations, winning for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series in 1977. Since his departure, he has returned for guest roles.\nAykroyd's most famous roles are as Elwood J. Blues in \"The Blues Brothers\" (1980) and \"Blues Brothers 2000\" (1998), and Dr. Raymond \"Ray\" Stantz in \"Ghostbusters\" (1984) and \"Ghostbusters II\" (1989). He reprised his role in various projects within the \"Ghostbusters\" franchise. He is also known for his comedic roles in \"1941\" (1979), \"Trading Places\" (1983), \"Spies Like Us\" (1985), \"Dragnet\" (1987), \"The Great Outdoors\" (1988), \"Nothing but Trouble\" (1991) and \"Coneheads\" (1993).\nIn 1990, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Boolie Werthan in \"Driving Miss Daisy\" (1989). Other dramatic roles include \"Chaplin\" (1992), \"North\" (1994), and \"Pearl Harbor\" (2001). Aykroyd has had supporting roles in comedy films such as \"Tommy Boy\" (1995), \"Grosse Pointe Blank\" (1997), \"Loser\" (2000), \"Evolution\" (2001), \"50 First Dates\" (2004), \"I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry\" (2007), and \"Tammy\" (2014).\nHe starred as Reverend Mike Weber in the sitcom \"Soul Man\" (1997\u20131998). He has made guest appearances on various television shows, including \"The Nanny\" (1994), \"According to Jim\" (2002\u20132009), \"Living with Fran\" (2006), \"The Defenders\" (2011) and \"Workin' Moms\" (2017\u20132023). Aykroyd is also a businessman, having co-founded the House of Blues chain of music venues and the Crystal Head Vodka brand.\nEarly life.\nAykroyd was born on July 1, 1952, at Ottawa General Hospital in Ottawa, Ontario. His father, Samuel Cuthbert Peter Hugh Aykroyd (1922\u20132020), a civil engineer, worked as a policy adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and his mother, Lorraine H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Marie (n\u00e9e Gougeon; 1918\u20132018), was a secretary. His mother was of French Canadian descent and his father of English, Scottish, Irish, French, and Dutch ancestry. His paternal ancestor was Englishman Samuel Aykroyd from Halifax, Yorkshire, who emigrated to the United States, eventually settling in Upper Canada near Kingston, Ontario, in 1810. His brother, Peter (1955\u20132021), was also an actor.\nHe attended St. Pius X and St. Patrick's High Schools, and studied criminology and sociology at Carleton University but dropped out before completing his degree. He worked as a comedian in various Canadian nightclubs and ran an after-hours speakeasy, Club 505, in Toronto for several years.\nAykroyd developed his musical career in Ottawa, particularly through his regular attendance at Le Hibou, a club that featured many blues artists. He describes these influences:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There was a little disco club there called Le Hibou, which in French means \"the owl.\" And it was run by a gentleman named Harvey Glatt, and he brought every, and I mean every, blues star that you or I would ever have wanted to have seen through Ottawa in the late '50s, well I guess more late '60s sort of, in around the Newport jazz rediscovery. I was going to Le Hibou and hearing James Cotton, Otis Spann, Pinetop Perkins, and Muddy Waters. I did actually jam behind Muddy Waters. S. P. Leary left the drum kit one night, and Muddy said \"anybody out there play drums? I don't have a drummer.\" And I walked on stage and we started, I don't know, Little Red Rooster, something. He said \"keep that beat going, you make Muddy feel good.\" And I heard Howlin' Wolf (Chester Burnett). Many, many times I saw Howlin' Wolf. As well as the Doors. And of course Buddy Guy, Buddy Guy and Junior Wells, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. So I was exposed to all of these players, playing there as part of this scene to service the academic community in Ottawa, a very well-educated community. Had I lived in a different town I don't think that this would have happened, because it was just the confluence of educated government workers, and then also all the colleges in the area, Ottawa University, Carleton, and all the schools\u2014these people were interested in blues culture.\nAykroyd's first professional experience, which he gained at the age of 17, was as a member of the cast of the short-lived Canadian sketch comedy series \"The Hart and Lorne Terrific Hour\", with Lorne Michaels, among others. He was a member of the Second City comedy troupe in 1973 in both Toronto and Chicago.\nCareer.\n\"Saturday Night Live\".\nAykroyd gained fame on the American late-night comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\" (\"SNL\"). He was originally hired, and paid $278 a week (equivalent to $1,603 in 2024), as a writer, but became part of the cast before the series premiered. The original cast was called \"The Not Ready For Prime Time Players\". Aykroyd was the youngest member and appeared on the show for its first four seasons, from 1975 to 1979. He brought a sensibility that combined youth, unusual interests, talent as an impersonator, and manic intensity. Guest host Eric Idle of Monty Python said that Aykroyd's ability to write and act out characters made him the only member of the \"SNL\" cast capable of being a Python.\nHe was known for his impersonations of celebrities such as Jimmy Carter, Vincent Price, Richard Nixon, Rod Serling, Tom Snyder, and Julia Child. He was also known for his recurring roles, such as Beldar, father of the Coneheads family; with Steve Martin, Yortuk Festrunk, one of the \"Two Wild and Crazy Guys\" brothers from Bratislava, Slovakia; sleazy late-night cable TV host E. Buzz Miller and his cousin, corrupt maker of children's toys and costumes Irwin Mainway (who extolled the virtues and defended the safety of the \"Bag-o-Glass\" toy); Fred Garvin, a male prostitute; and high-bred but lowbrow critic Leonard Pinth-Garnell. Aykroyd and Jane Curtin parodied the CBS news show \"60 Minutes\" Point/Counterpoint segment, which featured the liberal Shana Alexander and the conservative segregationist James Kilpatrick, by portraying the two as hating each other; Aykroyd's first words in response to Curtin's point were, \"Jane, you ignorant slut!\"\nAykroyd's eccentric talent was recognized by others in the highly competitive \"SNL\" environment; when he first presented his \"Super Bass-O-Matic '76\" sketch, a fake TV commercial in which a garish pitchman based on Ron Popeil touts a food blender that turns an entire bass into liquid pulp, the other writers and cast members considered the sketch \"so exhilaratingly strange that many remember sitting and listening, open-mouthed... Nobody felt jealous of it because they couldn't imagine writing anything remotely like it.\" Aykroyd later said the sketch was inspired by seeing his aunt Helene Gougeon (a culinary writer and food columnist in Montreal) put a bass into a blender to make a bouillabaisse when he was 12 years old.\nAykroyd was a close friend and partner of fellow cast member John Belushi and shared some of his sensibilities, but was more reserved and less self-destructive. Aykroyd later recalled that, unlike Belushi and others of his peers, he was uninterested in recreational drug use.\nIn 1977, he received an Emmy Award for writing on \"SNL\"; he later received two more nominations for writing and one for acting. In \"Rolling Stone\"'s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 \"SNL\" cast members to date, Aykroyd ranked fifth (behind Belushi, Eddie Murphy, Tina Fey, and Mike Myers). \"Of all the original greats, Aykroyd is the least imitated\", they wrote, \"because nobody else can do what he did.\"\nIn later decades, Aykroyd made occasional guest appearances and unannounced cameos on \"SNL\", often playing the politician Bob Dole. He also brought back characters including Irwin Mainway and Leonard Pinth-Garnell. In 1995, he introduced a performance by Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip. A fan of the band, he had personally lobbied Lorne Michaels to book them as musical guests.\nDuring some guest appearances, he resurrected the Blues Brothers musical act with frequent host John Goodman in place of Belushi, who was by then deceased. He became the second member of the original cast to host \"SNL\" in May 2003, when he appeared in the season finale. During his monologue, he performed a musical number with James Belushi similar to the Blues Brothers, but neither man donned the black suit and sunglasses. On March 24, 2007, Aykroyd appeared as a crying fan of \"American Idol\" finalist Sanjaya Malakar (played by Andy Samberg) during \"Weekend Update\". On February 14, 2009, he appeared as U.S. House Minority leader John Boehner. Aykroyd also made a surprise guest appearance, along with many other \"SNL\" alumni, on the show of March 9, 2013.\n\"The Blues Brothers\".\nAykroyd was a close friend of John Belushi. According to Aykroyd, their first meeting helped spark the Blues Brothers act. When they met in a club that Aykroyd frequented, he played a blues record in the background, and it stimulated a fascination with blues in Belushi, who was primarily a fan of heavy rock bands at the time. Aykroyd educated Belushi on the finer points of blues music, and with a little encouragement from then-\"SNL\" music director Paul Shaffer, it led to the creation of their Blues Brothers characters.\nBacked by such experienced professional R&amp;B sidemen as lead guitarist Steve Cropper, sax man Lou Marini, trumpeter Alan Rubin, and bass guitarist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, the Blues Brothers proved more than an \"SNL\" novelty. Taking off with the public as a legitimate musical act, they performed live gigs and in 1978 released the hit album \"Briefcase Full of Blues\" (drawn from the fact that Aykroyd, as \"Elwood Blues\", carried his blues harmonicas in a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist in the manner of a CIA courier; Belushi originally carried the key to the handcuffs). \"Briefcase Full of Blues\" sold 3.5 million copies and is one of the highest-selling blues albums of all time. The band was much further popularized by the 1980 film \"The Blues Brothers\", which Aykroyd co-wrote. A sequel, \"Blues Brothers 2000\", was released in 1998 with John Goodman as Belushi's replacement.\nCherokee Studios in Los Angeles was a regular haunt for the original Blues Brothers in their early days. Belushi and Aykroyd became fixtures at the recording studio, while Blues Brothers band member Steve Cropper called Cherokee his producing home. When they needed a bass player, they were joined by another band member, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn. During this time, Cropper, along with producing partner and Cherokee owner Bruce Robb, worked on a number of music projects with the two comedians/musicians, including Belushi's favourite band, Fear, and later Aykroyd's movie \"Dragnet\".\nThe Blues Brothers Band continues to tour, both with and without Aykroyd. It features original members Cropper and Marini, along with vocalist Eddie Floyd. Aykroyd sometimes performs as Elwood, along with Belushi's younger brother Jim Belushi, who plays \"Brother Zee\" on stage. They are most frequently backed by the Sacred Hearts Band.\nOther film and television work.\nConcurrent with his work in \"Saturday Night Live\", Aykroyd played Purvis Bickle, lift operator at the fictitious office block 99 Sumach Street in the CBC Television series \"Coming Up Rosie\".\nAfter leaving \"SNL\", Aykroyd starred in a number of films, mostly comedies, with uneven results both commercially and artistically. His first three American feature films all co-starred Belushi. The first, \"1941\" (1979), directed by Steven Spielberg, was a box-office disappointment. The second, \"The Blues Brothers\" (1980), which he co-wrote with director John Landis, was a massive hit. The third, \"Neighbors\" (1981), had a mixed critical reaction but was another box-office hit. One of his best-received performances was as a blueblood-turned-wretch in the 1983 comedy \"Trading Places\", in which he co-starred with fellow \"SNL\" alumnus Eddie Murphy and Jamie Lee Curtis. He also appeared in \"\" in the prologue and at the end of Segment Four as the passenger and the ambulance driver.\nIn the early 1980s, Aykroyd began work on a script for the film that eventually became \"Ghostbusters\", inspired by his fascination with parapsychology and his belief in ghosts. The script initially included a much greater fantasy element, including time travel, but this was toned down substantially through work on the script with Harold Ramis (who became a co-writer) and director Ivan Reitman. Aykroyd originally wrote the role of Dr. Peter Venkman with Belushi in mind, but rewrote it for Bill Murray after Belushi's death. Aykroyd joked that the green ghost, later known as \"Slimer\", was the ghost of John Belushi and based on Belushi's party-animal personality. \"Ghostbusters\" was released in 1984 and became a huge success for Aykroyd, who also appeared as one of the lead actors; the film earned nearly US$ on a US$ budget. Aykroyd also briefly appeared in the hit 1984 action-adventure film \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" as an escort with a British accent. \nAykroyd's next major film role was in the 1985 spy comedy film \"Spies Like Us\", which like \"The Blues Brothers\" was co-conceived and co-written by Aykroyd and directed by Landis. Aykroyd had again intended for Belushi to be the other lead in the film; the part was given to \"SNL\" alumnus Chevy Chase. The film was intended as an homage to the Bob Hope/Bing Crosby \"Road to ...\" movies of the 1940s to 1960s. Hope made a cameo appearance in the film.\n\"Dragnet\", in which Aykroyd co-starred (with Tom Hanks) and which he co-wrote, was released in 1987. The film was both an homage and a satire of the previous \"Dragnet\" series, with Aykroyd playing Joe Friday as a police officer whose law-and-order attitude is at odds with modern sensibilities.\nIn 1988, Aykroyd co-starred with John Candy in the comedy film \"The Great Outdoors\". He appeared in four other films released in 1988 (\"The Couch Trip\", \"She's Having a Baby\", \"Caddyshack II\", and \"My Stepmother Is an Alien\"), all of them critical and commercial failures. His performance in \"Caddyshack II\" won him the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor.\nA sequel to \"Ghostbusters\", \"Ghostbusters II\", was released in 1989; Aykroyd and the other co-creators were reluctant to make another \"Ghostbusters\" film, but succumbed to pressure from the film's studio, Columbia Pictures. The film, while considered inferior to the original, was another big hit, earning US$. Aykroyd was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for 1989's \"Driving Miss Daisy\". He was the fourth \"SNL\" cast member to be nominated for an Oscar, after Joan Cusack.\nAykroyd's directorial debut was 1991's \"Nothing but Trouble\" starring Demi Moore, Chevy Chase, John Candy, and Aykroyd, sporting a bulbous prosthetic nose. The film was a critical and box-office flop, and Aykroyd won a second Razzie for Worst Supporting Actor. Most of Aykroyd's other films in the 1990s were similarly poorly received, including \"Chaplin\" (1992), \"Coneheads\" (1993, also based on a \"SNL\" skit), \"North\" (1994), \"Exit to Eden\" (1994), \"Canadian Bacon\" (1995), \"Getting Away with Murder\" (1996), and \"Blues Brothers 2000\" (1998). Four exceptions were \"My Girl\" (1991), which starred Jamie Lee Curtis and Macaulay Culkin; \"Sneakers\" (1992), which starred Robert Redford; \"Tommy Boy\" (1995), which starred \"SNL\" alumni David Spade and Chris Farley, in which Aykroyd played the role of Ray Zalinsky; and \"Grosse Pointe Blank\" (1997), in which Aykroyd had a well-received role as a rival hit man.\nIn 1994, Aykroyd made a guest appearance in an episode of the sitcom \"The Nanny\" as a refrigerator repairman. In 1997, he starred as an Episcopal priest in the ABC sitcom \"Soul Man\", which lasted two seasons. In 1998, he voiced the role of Chip, a wasp, in the DreamWorks Animation film \"Antz\".\nIn 2001, Aykroyd starred in the Woody Allen film \"The Curse of the Jade Scorpion\". Most of his subsequent film roles have tended to be small character parts in big-budget productions, such as a father in \"Loser\" (2000), a signals analyst in \"Pearl Harbor\" (2001), a neurologist in \"50 First Dates\" (2004), an annoying neighbor in \"Christmas with the Kranks\" (2004), and a fire captain in \"I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry\" (2007). \nIn 2009, Aykroyd and Ramis wrote and appeared in \"\", which also featured Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, William Atherton, and Brian Doyle-Murray. In 2010, he played the voice of the title character, Yogi Bear, in the live-action/CGI-animated-film \"Yogi Bear\". That same year, Aykroyd and Chevy Chase guest-starred in the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Spies Reminiscent of Us\", an homage to \"Spies Like Us\".\nOther television series that Aykroyd appeared in include \"According to Jim\" (2002\u20132009, which starred Jim Belushi), \"Living with Fran\" (2006), and \"Workin' Moms\" (2017\u20132023). Aykroyd appeared in two 2011 episodes of CBS's \"The Defenders\" as Judge Max Hunter, which also starred Jim Belushi. He also appeared on \"Top Chef Canada\" as a guest judge. He had supporting roles in the 2012 political comedy film \"The Campaign\", which starred \"SNL\" alum Will Ferrell, and in the 2013 HBO film \"Behind the Candelabra\".\nIn 2014, Aykroyd voiced the role of Scarecrow in \"\", and had a supporting role in the comedy film \"Tammy\". In 2015, he appeared in a State Farm insurance commercial along with Jane Curtin and Laraine Newman, as the Coneheads, talking to \"Jake\", a State Farm agent, and played the emcee of the video game championship in the science fiction comedy film \"Pixels\".\nAykroyd was one of the executive producers of \"Ghostbusters\" (2016), a long-discussed reboot of the \"Ghostbusters\" franchise. He had a cameo appearance in the film, along with many of the rest of the surviving original \"Ghostbusters\" cast.\nIn 2021, Aykroyd provided the voice of the Postage Stamp Fellow in the episode \"The Dad-Feelings Limited\" in the TV series \"The Simpsons\". He also reprised his role of Dr. Ray Stantz in the movie ' (2021). Aykroyd expressed interest in having the surviving three actors of the original Ghostbusters reprising their roles for as many sequels as possible. He again reprised his role in ' (2024).\nOther musical endeavours.\nAykroyd participated in the recording of \"We Are the World\" in 1985, as a member of the chorus. He wrote the liner notes for fellow Ottawa-born blues musician JW-Jones's album \"Bluelisted\" in 2008. Until it ended in 2018, he hosted the internationally syndicated radio show \"Elwood's BluesMobile\", formerly known as the \"House of Blues Radio Hour\", under his Blues Brothers moniker Elwood Blues.\nBusiness ventures.\nIn 1992, Aykroyd and Hard Rock Cafe co-founder Isaac Tigrett founded the House of Blues, a chain of music venues, with the mission to host all genres of musical performances with a primary theme focused on blues music and folk art. \nMany other music and Hollywood personalities helped to finance this chain at its start. It began as a single location in Cambridge, Massachusetts, although other locations quickly followed, starting with a venue in New Orleans in 1994. On New Year's Eve that year, Aykroyd opened the \"Aykroyd's Ghetto House Cafe\" featuring one of the eight police cars from the first Blues Brothers movie protruding from the second story, on Princess Street in Kingston, Ontario.\nIn 2004, \"House of Blues\" became the second-largest live music promoter in the world, with seven venues and 22 amphitheatres in the United States and Canada. It was bought by Live Nation in 2006. In 2007, Aykroyd and artist John Alexander founded Crystal Head Vodka, a brand of high-end vodka known for its skull-shaped bottle and for being filtered through Herkimer diamond crystals.\nIn 2016, Aykroyd partnered with TV producers Eric Bischoff and Jason Hervey and game developer Ike McFadden to release an online-casino game that features the Blues Brothers. He provided the in-game voice of Elwood Blues via voiceover. Aykroyd is also owner in part of several wineries in Canada's Niagara Peninsula, and the company that distributes Patr\u00f3n tequila in Canada.\nCharitable works.\nIn 2009, Aykroyd contributed a series of reminiscences about his upbringing in Canada for a charity album, \"Dan Aykroyd's Canada\". He helped start the Blue Line Foundation, which is redeveloping flood-damaged lots in New Orleans and helping first responders buy them at reduced prices. Coastal Blue Line LLC, hopes to eventually rebuild 400 properties in New Orleans.\nAykroyd is a member of Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.\nPersonal life.\nAykroyd was briefly engaged to actress Carrie Fisher, proposing to her on the set of \"The Blues Brothers\". In the film, she appeared as a jilted girlfriend of John Belushi's character, Jake Blues. Their engagement ended when she reconciled with her former boyfriend, musician Paul Simon. On April 29, 1983, Aykroyd married actress Donna Dixon on a friend's rooftop in Martha's Vineyard. The couple met on the set of \"Doctor Detroit\" and appeared together in four additional films: \"\" (1983), \"Spies Like Us\" (1985), \"The Couch Trip\" (1988), and \"Exit to Eden\" (1994). Together they have three daughters, including Danielle (known by her stage name, Vera Sola). In 2022 the couple announced that they were separating but would remain legally married.\nAykroyd maintains his Canadian roots as a longtime resident of Sydenham, Ontario, with his estate on Loughborough Lake.\nIn a 2004 NPR interview with host Terry Gross, Aykroyd said he had been diagnosed in childhood with Tourette syndrome (TS). He said his TS was successfully treated with therapy. In 2015, he said in an interview on \"HuffPost\" with hosts Roy Sekoff and Marc Lamont Hill that he has Asperger syndrome which was \"never diagnosed\", but was \"sort of a self-diagnosis\" based on several of his own characteristics, contradicting his earlier claim in the \"Daily Mail\" that he had been officially diagnosed in the early 1980s after his wife Donna persuaded him to see a doctor. Aykroyd's family members noticed a pattern of behavior consistent with the syndrome when he was in middle school and was evaluated by a psychologist, but the condition had not yet been identified at the time.\nAykroyd is a former reserve commander for the police department in Harahan, Louisiana, working for Chief of Police Peter Dale. While on the force, he carried his badge with him at all times. He currently serves as a reserve deputy of the Hinds County Sheriff's Department in Hinds County, Mississippi. He supports the reserves with a fundraiser concert along with other blues and gospel singers in Mississippi.\nAykroyd's passions for the outdoors, geology and paleontology, which he attributes to watching his father work on constructing the Gatineau Parkway which included blasting through granite rock formations to run the highway, led him to join Canadian paleontologist Philip J. Currie on a number of digs, including fundraising digs and galas as fundraisers for the construction of the Philip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum in Wembley, Alberta, which recognized Aykroyd's contributions by naming its theatre the \"Aykroyd Family Theatre\".\nAykroyd has obtained American citizenship.\nFriendship with John Belushi.\nIn an appearance on the \"Today\" show, Aykroyd called Belushi and himself \"kindred spirits\". In the biography \"Belushi\", Aykroyd claims that Belushi was the only man with whom he could ever dance. The pair were scheduled to present the Academy Award for Visual Effects in 1982, but Belushi died a few weeks before the ceremony. Devastated by his friend's death, Aykroyd presented the award alone, saying from the stage, \"My partner would have loved to have been here to present this, given that he was something of a visual effect himself.\"\nAykroyd was an outspoken critic of the 1989 film \"Wired\", a biopic of Belushi based on the 1984 book of the same name by Bob Woodward and starring Michael Chiklis in his film debut as Belushi and Gary Groomes as Aykroyd. Along with Belushi's widow Judith, his brother Jim, and many other friends, associates and relatives of Belushi, he boycotted the film and the associated book for misrepresenting Belushi's life, and in an interview for MTV's \"The Big Picture\" in June 1988, expressed his desire that the film would underperform at the box office, which ultimately happened; he said, \"I have witches working now to jinx the thing... I hope it never gets seen and I am going to hurl all the negative energy I can and muster all my hell energies. My thunderbolts are out on this one, quite truthfully.\" He had actor J. T. Walsh removed from the film \"Loose Cannons\" after Walsh had already done two days of filming after finding out that Walsh had been in the cast of \"Wired\". Walsh, who had played Woodward in \"Wired\", was replaced by Paul Koslo, causing the film a $125,000 production delay.\nBeliefs.\nAykroyd considers himself a Spiritualist, stating:\nI am a Spiritualist, a proud wearer of the Spiritualist badge. Mediums and psychic research have gone on for many, many years ... Loads of people have seen spirits, heard a voice, or felt the cold temperature. I believe that they are between here and there, that they exist between the fourth and fifth dimensions, and that they visit us frequently.\nAykroyd's great-grandfather, a dentist, was a mystic who corresponded with author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle on the subject of Spiritualism, and was a member of the Lily Dale Society. Other than Spiritualism, Aykroyd is also interested in various other aspects of the paranormal, particularly UFOlogy. He is a lifetime member of and official Hollywood consultant for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON). Along these lines, he served, from 1996 to 2000, as host of \"\", which claimed to describe cases drawn from the archives of \"The Office of Scientific Investigation and Research\". In 2005, Aykroyd produced the DVD \"Dan Aykroyd: Unplugged on UFOs\".\nAykroyd was interviewed for 80 minutes by UFOlogist David Sereda, discussing in depth many aspects of the UFO phenomenon.\nOn September 29, 2009, Peter Aykroyd Sr., Dan's father, published a book entitled \"A History of Ghosts\". This book chronicled the family's historical involvement in the Spiritualist movement, to which Aykroyd readily refers. Aykroyd wrote the introduction and accompanied his father on a series of promotional activities, including launches in New York and Toronto, appearances on \"Larry King Live\" and \"Coast to Coast AM\", and various other public-relations initiatives. Aykroyd also read the introduction for the audio version of the book. In 1997, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry awarded Aykroyd \"in absentia\" the Snuffed Candle Award for hosting \"Psi Factor\" and being a \"long-time promoter ... of paranormal claims\". Following the awards, Joe Nickell wrote to Aykroyd asking for the research behind the \"cases\" presented on \"Psi Factor\", particularly a claim that NASA scientists were \"killed while investigating a meteor crash and giant eggs were found and incubated, yielding a flea the size of a hog\".\nAwards and nominations.\nIn 1977, Aykroyd received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy-Variety or Music Series for his collaborative work on \"Saturday Night Live\". In 1994, he received an honorary Doctor of Literature degree from Carleton University. In 1999, Aykroyd was made a Member of the Order of Canada. He was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2002. In 2017, he was made a member of the Order of Ontario in recognition for being \"one of the world's most popular entertainers, well-known for his time on \"Saturday Night Live\" and the 1984 classic movie \"Ghostbusters\".\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was signed on September 5, 1905, after negotiations from August 6 to 30, at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, United States. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was instrumental in the negotiations and won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts, the first ever American recipient. The treaty recognized Japan's hegemony in Korea (which soon after became a protectorate of the Empire of Japan), awarded it Russia's lease on the Liaodong Peninsula (which became the Kwantung Leased Territory), control of the Russian-built South Manchuria Railway, and the southern half of the island of Sakhalin (Karafuto).\nBackground.\nThe war of 1904\u20131905 was fought between the Russian Empire, an international power with one of the largest armies in the world, and the Empire of Japan, a nation that had only recently industrialized after two-and-a-half centuries of isolation. A series of battles in the Liaodong Peninsula had resulted in Russian armies being driven from southern Manchuria, and the Battle of Tsushima had resulted in a cataclysm for the Imperial Russian Navy. The war was unpopular in Russia, whose government was under increasing threat of revolution at home. On the other hand, the Japanese economy was severely strained by the war, with rapidly mounting foreign debts, and Japanese forces in Manchuria faced the problem of ever-extending supply lines. No Russian territory had been seized, and the Russians continued to build up reinforcements via the Trans-Siberian Railway. Recognizing that a long war was not to Japan's advantage, the Japanese government as early as July 1904 had begun seeking out intermediaries to assist in bringing the war to a negotiated conclusion.\nThe intermediary approached by the Japanese was U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, who had publicly expressed a pro-Japanese stance at the beginning of the war. However, as the war progressed, Roosevelt had begun to show concerns about the strengthening military power of Japan and its long-term impact on U.S. interests in Asia. In February 1905, Roosevelt sent messages to the Russian government via the U.S. ambassador in Saint Petersburg. Initially, the Russians were unresponsive, with Tsar Nicholas II still adamant that Russia would eventually prove victorious. The Japanese government was also lukewarm to a peace treaty, as Japanese armies were enjoying an unbroken string of victories. However, after the Battle of Mukden, which was extremely costly to both sides in terms of manpower and resources, Japanese Foreign Minister Komura Jutar\u014d judged that it was now critical for Japan to push for a settlement.\nOn March 8, 1905, Japanese Army Minister Terauchi Masatake met with the American Minister to Japan, Lloyd Griscom, to tell Roosevelt that Japan was ready to negotiate. However, a positive response did not come from Russia until after the loss of the Russian fleet at the Battle of Tsushima. Two days later, Nicholas met with his grand dukes and military leadership and agreed to discuss peace. On June 7, 1905, Roosevelt met with Kaneko Kentar\u014d, a Japanese diplomat, and on June 8, he received a positive reply from Russia. Roosevelt chose Portsmouth, New Hampshire, as the site for the negotiations, primarily because the talks were to begin in August, and the cooler climate in Portsmouth would avoid subjecting the parties to the sweltering Washington summer.\nPortsmouth Peace Conference.\nThe Japanese delegation to the Portsmouth Peace Conference was led by Foreign Minister Komura Jutar\u014d and assisted by Ambassador Takahira Kogor\u014d. The Russian delegation was led by former Finance Minister Sergei Witte, who was assisted by the former Ambassador to Japan Roman Rosen and the international law and arbitration specialist Friedrich Martens. The delegations arrived in Portsmouth on August 8 and stayed in New Castle, New Hampshire, at the Hotel Wentworth, where the armistice was signed. They were ferried across the Piscataqua River every day to the naval base in Kittery, Maine, where the negotiations were held.\nThe negotiations took place at the General Stores Building (now Building 86). Mahogany furniture patterned after the Cabinet Room of the White House was ordered from Washington.\nBefore the negotiations began, Tsar Nicholas had adopted a hard line and forbidden his delegates to agree to any territorial concessions, reparations, or limitations on the deployment of Russian forces in the Far East. The Japanese initially demanded recognition of their interests in Korea, the removal of all Russian forces from Manchuria, and substantial reparations. They also wanted confirmation of their control of the island of Sakhalin, which Japanese forces had seized in July 1905, partly to use as a in the negotiations.\nA total of twelve sessions were held between August 9 and August 30. During the first eight sessions, the delegates were able to reach an agreement on eight points. These included an immediate ceasefire, recognition of Japan's claims to Korea, and the evacuation of Russian forces from Manchuria. Russia also ceded its leases in southern Manchuria (containing Port Arthur and Talien) to Japan and turned over the South Manchuria Railway and its mining concessions to Japan. Russia was allowed to retain the Chinese Eastern Railway in northern Manchuria. \nThe remaining four sessions addressed the most difficult issues: reparations and territorial concessions. On August 18, Roosevelt proposed that Rosen offer to divide Sakhalin to address the territory issue. On August 23, however, Witte proposed that the Japanese keep Sakhalin and drop their claims for reparations. When Komura rejected the proposal, Witte warned that he was instructed to cease negotiations and that the war would resume. The ultimatum came as four new Russian divisions arrived in Manchuria, and the Russian delegation made an ostentatious show of packing their bags and preparing to depart. Witte was convinced that the Japanese could not afford to restart the war and so applied pressure via the American media and his American hosts to convince the Japanese that monetary compensation was not open for compromise by Russia. Outmaneuvered by Witte, Komura yielded, and in exchange for the southern half of Sakhalin, the Japanese dropped their claims for reparations.\nThe Treaty of Portsmouth was signed on September 5. The treaty was ratified by the Privy Council of Japan on October 10, and in Russia on October 14, 1905.\nAftermath.\nThe signing of the treaty created three decades of peace between the two nations and confirmed Japan's emergence as the pre-eminent power in East Asia. Born from the Taft\u2013Katsura agreement, Article 2 of the treaty acknowledged that Japan possessed in Korea paramount political, military and economical interests, and later resulted in the annexation of Korea to Japan in 1910.\nThe treaty also forced Russian Empire to abandon its expansionist policies in East Asia, but it was not well received by the Japanese people. The Japanese public was aware of their country's unbroken string of military victories over the Russians but was less aware of the precarious overextension of military and economic power that the victories had required. News of the terms of the treaty appeared to show Japanese weakness in front of the European powers, and this frustration caused the Hibiya riots and the collapse of the First Katsura Cabinet (first premiership of Katsura Tar\u014d) on January 7, 1906.\nBecause of the role played by Theodore Roosevelt, the United States became a significant force in world diplomacy. President Roosevelt was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906 for his backchannel efforts before and during the peace negotiations, even though he never actually went to Portsmouth.\nCriticism.\nKorean historians (such as Ki-baik Lee, author of \"A New History of Korea\", Harvard University Press, 1984) believe that the Treaty of Portsmouth violated the Korean\u2013American Treaty of Amity and Commerce signed at Incheon on May 22, 1882, because the Joseon government considered that treaty constituted a \"de facto\" mutual defense treaty, unlike the Americans. The problem was Article 1: \"There shall be perpetual peace and friendship between the President of the United States and the King of Chosen and the citizens and subjects of their respective Governments. If other powers deal unjustly or oppressively with either Government, the other will exert their good offices on being informed of the case to bring about an amicable arrangement, thus showing their friendly feelings.\"\nThe treaty has been cited in contemporary South Korea by some as an example that the United States cannot be relied upon with regards to issues of South Korean security and sovereignty.\nCommemoration.\nIn 1994, the Portsmouth Peace Treaty Forum was created by the Japan-America Society of New Hampshire to commemorate the Portsmouth Peace Treaty with the first formal meeting between Japanese and Russian scholars and diplomats in Portsmouth since 1905. As the Treaty of Portsmouth was one of the most powerful symbols of peace in the Northern Pacific region and the most significant shared peace history of Japan, Russia, and the United States, the forum was designed to explore from the Japanese, Russian, and American perspectives, the history of the Portsmouth Treaty and its relevance to current issues involving the Northern Pacific region. The forum is intended to focus modern scholarship on international problems in the \"spirit of the Portsmouth Peace Treaty.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "49658", "revid": "48296011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49658", "title": "Aurora", "text": "Atmospheric effect caused by the solar wind\nAn aurora (pl. aurorae or auroras) is a natural light display in Earth's sky, predominantly observed in high-latitude regions around the Arctic and Antarctic. The terms northern lights (aurora borealis) and southern lights (aurora australis) are used in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres respectively. Auroras display dynamic patterns of radiant light that appear as curtains, rays, spirals or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.\nAuroras are the result of disturbances in the Earth's magnetosphere caused by enhanced speeds of solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles.\nOther planets in the Solar System, brown dwarfs, comets, and some natural satellites also host auroras.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"aurora borealis\" appeared in a 1649 description by Pierre Gassendi of an auroral display visible all over France in 1621. Gassendi had read the works of Galileo Galilei, who used the term in his extensive writings about aurora in 1619. The term entered the English language in 1828.\nThe word \"aurora\" is derived from the name of the Roman goddess of the dawn, Aurora, who travelled from east to west announcing the coming of the Sun. \"Aurora\" was first used in English in the 14th century. The words \"borealis\" and \"australis\" are derived from the names of the ancient gods of the north wind (Boreas) and the south wind (Auster or \"australis\") in Greco-Roman mythology.\nOccurrence.\nAuroras are most commonly observed in the \"auroral zone\", a band approximately 6\u00b0 (~660\u00a0km) wide in latitude centred on 67\u00b0 north and south. The region that currently displays an aurora is called the \"auroral oval\". The oval is displaced by the solar wind, pushing it about 15\u00b0 away from the geomagnetic pole (not the geographic pole) in the noon direction and 23\u00b0 away in the midnight direction. The peak equatorward extent of the oval is displaced slightly from geographic midnight. It is centred about 3\u20135\u00b0 nightward of the magnetic pole so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the magnetic pole in question is in between the observer and the Sun, which is called magnetic midnight.\nEarly evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations. Elias Loomis (1860), and later Hermann Fritz (1881) and Sophus Tromholt (1881) in more detail, established that the aurora appeared mainly in the auroral zone.\nIn northern latitudes, the effect is known as the aurora borealis or the northern lights. The southern counterpart, the aurora australis or the southern lights, has features almost identical to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone. The aurora australis is visible from high southern latitudes in Antarctica, the Southern Cone, South Africa, Australasia, the Falkland Islands, and under exceptional circumstances as far north as Uruguay. The aurora borealis is visible from areas around the Arctic such as Alaska, Canada, Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Scandinavia, Finland, Scotland, and Russia. A geomagnetic storm causes the auroral ovals (north and south) to expand, bringing the aurora to lower latitudes or higher in the south. On rare occasions, the aurora borealis can be seen as far south as the Mediterranean and the southern states of the US while the aurora australis can be seen as far north as New Caledonia and the Pilbara region in Western Australia. During the Carrington Event, the greatest geomagnetic storm ever observed, auroras were seen even in the tropics.\nAuroras seen within the auroral oval may be directly overhead. From farther away, they illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow, or sometimes a faint red, as if the Sun were rising from an unusual direction. Auroras also occur poleward of the auroral zone as either diffuse patches or arcs, which can be subvisual.\nAuroras are occasionally seen in latitudes below the auroral zone when a geomagnetic storm temporarily enlarges the auroral oval. Large geomagnetic storms are most common during the peak of the 11-year sunspot cycle or during the three years after the peak. An electron spirals (gyrates) about a field line at an angle that is determined by its velocity vectors, parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the local geomagnetic field vector B. This angle is known as the \"pitch angle\" of the particle. The distance, or radius, of the electron from the field line at any time is known as its Larmor radius. The pitch angle increases as the electron travels to a region of greater field strength nearer to the atmosphere. Thus, it is possible for some particles to return, or mirror, if the angle becomes 90\u00b0 before entering the atmosphere to collide with the denser molecules there. Other particles that do not mirror enter the atmosphere and contribute to the auroral display over a range of altitudes. Other types of auroras have been observed from space; for example, \"poleward arcs\" stretching sunward across the polar cap, the related \"theta aurora\", and \"dayside arcs\" near noon. These are relatively infrequent and poorly understood. Other interesting effects occur such as pulsating aurora, \"black aurora\" and their rarer companion \"anti-black aurora\" and subvisual red arcs. In addition to all these, a weak glow (often deep red) is observed around the two polar cusps, the field lines separating the ones that close through Earth from those that are swept into the tail and close remotely.\nAltitude.\nStarting in 1911,\nCarl St\u00f8rmer and his colleagues used cameras to triangulate more than 12,000 auroras. They found no auroras below and only 6.5% above , with a maximum in the height distribution around .\nForms.\nAccording to Clark (2007), there are five main forms that can be seen from the ground, from least to most visible:\nBrekke (1994) also described some auroras as \"curtains\". The similarity to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs. Arcs can fragment or break up into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky. These are also known as \"discrete auroras\", which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper at night.\nThese forms are consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field. The appearances of arcs, rays, curtains, and coronas are determined by the shapes of the luminous parts of the atmosphere and a viewer's position.\nChanges with time.\nAuroras change with time. Over the night they begin with glows and progress toward coronas, although they may not reach them. They tend to fade in the opposite order. Until about 1963, it was thought that these changes were due to the rotation of the Earth under a pattern fixed with respect to the Sun. Later, it was found by comparing all-sky films of auroras from different places (collected during the International Geophysical Year) that they often undergo global changes in a process called auroral substorm. They change in a few minutes from quiet arcs all along the auroral oval to active displays along the dark side and after 1\u20133 hours they gradually change back. Changes in auroras over time are commonly visualized using keograms.\nAt shorter time scales, auroras can change their appearances and intensity, sometimes so slowly as to be difficult to notice, and at other times rapidly down to the sub-second scale. The phenomenon of pulsating auroras is an example of intensity variations over short timescales, typically with periods of 2\u201320 seconds. This type of aurora is generally accompanied by decreasing peak emission heights of about 8\u00a0km for blue and green emissions and above-average solar wind speeds (c.).\nOther auroral radiation.\nIn addition, the aurora and associated currents produce a strong radio emission around 150\u00a0kHz known as auroral kilometric radiation (AKR), discovered in 1972. Ionospheric absorption makes AKR only observable from space. X-ray emissions, originating from the particles associated with auroras, have also been detected.\nNoise.\nAurora noise, similar to a crackling noise, begins about above Earth's surface and is caused by charged particles in an inversion layer of the atmosphere formed during a cold night. The charged particles discharge when particles from the Sun hit the inversion layer, creating the noise.\nAbnormal types.\nSTEVE.\nIn 2016, more than fifty citizen science observations described what was to them an unknown type of aurora which they named \"STEVE\", for \"Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement\". STEVE is not an aurora but is caused by a wide ribbon of hot plasma at an altitude of , with a temperature of and flowing at a speed of (compared to outside the ribbon).\nPicket-fence aurora.\nThe processes that cause STEVE are also associated with a picket-fence aurora, although the latter can be seen without STEVE. It is an aurora because it is caused by the precipitation of electrons in the atmosphere but it appears outside the auroral oval, closer to the equator than typical auroras. When the picket-fence aurora appears with STEVE, it is below.\nDune aurora.\nFirst reported in 2020, and confirmed in 2021, the dune aurora phenomenon was discovered by Finnish citizen scientists. It consists of regularly spaced, parallel stripes of brighter emission in the green diffuse aurora which gives the impression of sand dunes. The phenomenon is believed to be caused by the modulation of atomic oxygen density by a large-scale atmospheric wave travelling horizontally in a waveguide through an inversion layer in the mesosphere in presence of electron precipitation.\nHorse-collar aurora.\nHorse-collar auroras (HCA) are auroral features in which the auroral ellipse shifts poleward during the dawn and dusk portions and the polar cap becomes teardrop-shaped. They form during periods when the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is permanently northward, when the IMF clock angle is small. Their formation is associated with the closure of the magnetic flux at the top of the dayside magnetosphere by the double lobe reconnection (DLR). There are approximately 8 HCA events per month, with no seasonal dependence, and that the IMF must be within 30 degrees of northwards.\nConjugate auroras.\nConjugate auroras are nearly exact mirror-image auroras found at conjugate points in the northern and southern hemispheres on the same geomagnetic field lines. These generally happen at the time of the equinoxes, when there is little difference in the orientation of the north and south geomagnetic poles to the Sun. Attempts were made to image conjugate auroras by aircraft from Alaska and New Zealand in 1967, 1968, 1970, and 1971, with some success.\nCauses.\nA full understanding of the physical processes that lead to different types of auroras is still incomplete, but the basic cause involves the interaction of the solar wind with Earth's magnetosphere. The varying intensity of the solar wind produces effects of different magnitudes but includes one or more of the following physical scenarios.\nThe details of these phenomena are not fully understood. However, it is clear that the prime source of auroral particles is the solar wind feeding the magnetosphere, the reservoir containing the radiation zones and temporarily magnetically trapped particles confined by the geomagnetic field, coupled with particle acceleration processes.\nAuroral particles.\nThe immediate cause of the ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from Fort Churchill in Canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above. Since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone. The main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000\u00a0km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere. These electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field.\nElectrons are mainly responsible for diffuse and pulsating auroras have, in contrast, a smoothly falling energy distribution, and an angular (pitch-angle) distribution favouring directions perpendicular to the local magnetic field. Pulsations were discovered to originate at or close to the equatorial crossing point of auroral zone magnetic field lines. Protons are also associated with auroras, both discrete and diffuse.\nAtmosphere.\nAuroras result from emissions of photons in Earth's upper atmosphere, above , from ionized nitrogen atoms regaining an electron, and oxygen atoms and nitrogen-based molecules returning from an excited state to the ground state. They are ionized or excited by the collision of particles precipitated into the atmosphere. Both incoming electrons and protons may be involved. Excitation energy is lost within the atmosphere by the emission of a photon, or by collision with another atom or molecule:\nOxygen is unusual in terms of its return to ground state: it can take 0.7 seconds to emit the 557.7\u00a0nm green light and up to two minutes for the red 630.0\u00a0nm emission. Collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission; this process is called collisional quenching. Because the highest parts of the atmosphere contain a higher percentage of oxygen and lower particle densities, such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red light. Collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere due to increasing density, so red emissions do not have time to happen, and eventually, even green light emissions are prevented.\nThe change in auroral colour with altitude is therefore explained\u2014oxygen red is predominant at high altitudes, followed by oxygen green and nitrogen blue/purple/red, then finally other hues of nitrogen blue/purple/red where particle collisions prevent oxygen from emissions. Green is the most common colour. Then comes pink, a mixture of light green and red, followed by pure red, then yellow (a mixture of red and green), and finally, pure blue.\nPrecipitating protons generally produce optical emissions as incident hydrogen atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere. Proton auroras are usually observed at lower latitudes.\nIonosphere.\nBright auroras are generally associated with Birkeland currents (Schield et al., 1969; Zmuda and Armstrong, 1973), which flow down into the ionosphere on one side of the pole and out on the other. In between, some of the current connects directly through the ionospheric E layer (125\u00a0km); the rest (\"region 2\") detours, leaving again through field lines closer to the equator and closing through the \"partial ring current\" carried by magnetically trapped plasma. The ionosphere is an ohmic conductor, so some consider that such currents require a driving voltage, which an, as yet unspecified, dynamo mechanism can supply. Electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40,000 volts, rising up to more than 200,000 volts during intense magnetic storms. In another interpretation, the currents are the direct result of electron acceleration into the atmosphere by wave/particle interactions.\nIonospheric resistance has a complex nature and leads to a secondary Hall current flow. Due to physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out, so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral electrojet. An auroral electrojet index (measured in nanotesla) is regularly derived from ground data and serves as a general measure of auroral activity. Kristian Birkeland deduced that the currents flowed in the east\u2013west directions along the auroral arc, and such currents, flowing from the dayside toward (approximately) midnight were later named \"auroral electrojets\" (see also Birkeland currents). The ionosphere can contribute to the formation of auroral arcs via the feedback instability under high ionospheric resistance conditions, observed at night time and in the dark Winter hemisphere.\nInteraction of the solar wind with Earth.\nEarth is constantly immersed in the solar wind, a flow of magnetized hot plasma (a gas of free electrons and positive ions) emitted by the Sun in all directions, a result of the two-million-degree temperature of the Sun's outermost layer, the corona. The solar wind reaches Earth with a velocity typically around 400\u00a0km/s, a density of around 5 ions/cm3, and a magnetic field intensity of around 2\u20135 nT (for comparison, Earth's surface field is typically 30,000\u201350,000 nT). During magnetic storms, in particular, flows can be several times faster; the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) may also be much stronger. Joan Feynman deduced in the 1970s that the long-term averages of solar wind speed correlated with geomagnetic activity. Her work resulted from data collected by the Explorer 33 spacecraft.\nThe solar wind and magnetosphere consist of plasma (ionized gas), which conducts electricity. It is well known (since Michael Faraday's work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs in a direction that the conductor cuts \"across\" (or is cut \"by\"), rather than \"along\", the lines of the magnetic field, an electric current is induced within the conductor. The strength of the current depends on a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together, and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the \"direction\" of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion. Dynamos make use of this basic process (\"the dynamo effect\"), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected, including plasmas and other fluids.\nThe IMF originates on the Sun, linked to the sunspots, and its field lines (lines of force) are dragged out by the solar wind. That alone would tend to line them up in the Sun-Earth direction, but the rotation of the Sun angles them at Earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the ecliptic plane, known as the Parker spiral. The field lines passing Earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge (\"limb\") of the visible Sun at any time.\nThe solar wind and the magnetosphere, being two electrically conducting fluids in relative motion, should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from the flow of the solar wind. However, this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines, but less readily perpendicular to them. Energy is more effectively transferred by the temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere. Unsurprisingly this process is known as magnetic reconnection. As already mentioned, it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward, in a similar direction to the geomagnetic field in the inner regions of both the north magnetic pole and south magnetic pole.\nAuroras are more frequent and brighter during the intense phase of the solar cycle when coronal mass ejections increase the intensity of the solar wind.\nMagnetosphere.\nEarth's magnetosphere is shaped by the impact of the solar wind on Earth's magnetic field. This forms an obstacle to the flow, diverting it, at an average distance of about 70,000\u00a0km (11 Earth radii or Re), producing a bow shock 12,000\u00a0km to 15,000\u00a0km (1.9 to 2.4 Re) further upstream. The width of the magnetosphere abreast of Earth is typically 190,000\u00a0km (30 Re), and on the night side, a long \"magnetotail\" of stretched field lines extends to great distances (&gt; 200 Re).\nThe high-latitude magnetosphere is filled with plasma as the solar wind passes Earth. The flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with additional turbulence, density, and speed in the solar wind. This flow is favoured by a southward component of the IMF, which can then directly connect to the high latitude geomagnetic field lines. The flow pattern of magnetospheric plasma is mainly from the magnetotail toward Earth, around Earth and back into the solar wind through the magnetopause on the day-side. In addition to moving perpendicular to Earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travels down along Earth's magnetic field lines, gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones. The cusps of the magnetosphere, separating geomagnetic field lines that close through Earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere, producing an auroral glow.\nOn 26 February 2008, THEMIS probes were able to determine, for the first time, the triggering event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms. Two of the five probes, positioned approximately one-third the distance to the Moon, measured events suggesting a magnetic reconnection event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification.\nGeomagnetic storms that ignite auroras may occur more often during the months around the equinoxes. It is not well understood, but geomagnetic storms may vary with Earth's seasons. Two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and Earth's axis to the ecliptic plane. As Earth orbits throughout the year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from different latitudes of the Sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees. Similarly, the 23-degree tilt of Earth's axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a diurnal variation changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident IMF throughout the year. These factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the IMF links to the magnetosphere. In turn, this affects which energy from the solar wind can reach Earth's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras. Recent evidence in 2021 has shown that individual separate substorms may in fact be correlated networked communities.\nAuroral particle acceleration.\nJust as there are many types of aurora, there are many different mechanisms that accelerate auroral particles into the atmosphere. Electron aurora in Earth's auroral zone (i.e. commonly visible aurora) can be split into two main categories with different immediate causes: diffuse and discrete aurora. Diffuse aurora appear relatively structureless to an observer on the ground, with indistinct edges and amorphous forms. Discrete aurora are structured into distinct features with well-defined edges such as arcs, rays, and coronas; they also tend to be much brighter than diffuse aurora.\nIn both cases, the electrons that eventually cause the aurora start out as electrons trapped by the magnetic field in Earth's magnetosphere. These trapped particles bounce back and forth along magnetic field lines and are prevented from hitting the atmosphere by the magnetic mirror formed by the increasing magnetic field strength closer to Earth. The magnetic mirror's ability to trap a particle depends on the particle's pitch angle: the angle between its direction of motion and the local magnetic field. An aurora is created by processes that decrease the pitch angle of many individual electrons, freeing them from the magnetic trap and causing them to hit the atmosphere.\nIn the case of diffuse auroras, the electron pitch angles are altered by their interaction with various plasma waves. Each interaction is essentially wave-particle scattering; the electron energy after interacting with the wave is similar to its energy before interaction, but the direction of motion is altered. If the final direction of motion after scattering is close to the field line (specifically, if it falls within the loss cone) then the electron will hit the atmosphere. Diffuse auroras are caused by the collective effect of many such scattered electrons hitting the atmosphere. The process is mediated by the plasma waves, which become stronger during periods of high geomagnetic activity, leading to increased diffuse aurora at those times.\nIn the case of discrete auroras, the trapped electrons are accelerated toward Earth by electric fields that form at an altitude of about 4000\u201312000\u00a0km in the \"auroral acceleration region\". The electric fields point away from Earth (i.e. upward) along the magnetic field line. Electrons moving downward through these fields gain a substantial amount of energy (on the order of a few keV) in the direction along the magnetic field line toward Earth. This field-aligned acceleration decreases the pitch angle for all of the electrons passing through the region, causing many of them to hit the upper atmosphere. In contrast to the scattering process leading to diffuse auroras, the electric field increases the kinetic energy of all of the electrons transiting downward through the acceleration region by the same amount. This accelerates electrons starting from the magnetosphere with initially low energies (tens of eV or less) to energies required to create an aurora (100s of eV or greater), allowing that large source of particles to contribute to creating auroral light.\nThe accelerated electrons carry an electric current along the magnetic field lines (a Birkeland current). Since the electric field points in the same direction as the current, there is a net conversion of electromagnetic energy into particle energy in the auroral acceleration region (an electric load). The energy to power this load is eventually supplied by the magnetized solar wind flowing around the obstacle of Earth's magnetic field, although exactly how that power flows through the magnetosphere is still an active area of research. While the energy to power the aurora is ultimately derived from the solar wind, the electrons themselves do not travel directly from the solar wind into Earth's auroral zone; magnetic field lines from these regions do not connect to the solar wind, so there is no direct access for solar wind electrons.\nSome auroral features are also created by electrons accelerated by dispersive Alfv\u00e9n waves. At small wavelengths, transverse to the background magnetic field (comparable to the electron inertial length or ion gyroradius), Alfv\u00e9n waves develop a significant electric field parallel to the background magnetic field. This electric field can accelerate electrons to keV energies, sufficient to produce auroral arcs. If the electrons have a speed close to that of the wave's phase velocity, they are accelerated in a manner analogous to a surfer catching an ocean wave. This constantly changing wave electric field can accelerate electrons along the field line, causing some of them to hit the atmosphere. Electrons accelerated by this mechanism tend to have a broad energy spectrum, in contrast to the sharply peaked energy spectrum typical of electrons accelerated by quasi-static electric fields.\nIn addition to the discrete and diffuse electron aurora, proton aurora is caused when magnetospheric protons collide with the upper atmosphere. The proton gains an electron in the interaction, and the resulting neutral hydrogen atom emits photons. The resulting light is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. Other aurora not covered by the above discussion include transpolar arcs (formed poleward of the auroral zone), cusp aurora (formed in two small high-latitude areas on the dayside), and some non-terrestrial auroras.\nHistorically significant events.\nThe discovery of a 1770 Japanese diary in 2017 depicting auroras above the ancient Japanese capital of Kyoto suggested that the storm may have been 7% larger than the Carrington event, which affected telegraph networks.\nThe auroras that resulted from the Carrington event on both 28 August and 2 September 1859, are thought to be the most spectacular in recent history. In a paper to the Royal Society on 21 November 1861, Balfour Stewart described both auroral events as documented by a self-recording magnetograph at the Kew Observatory and established the connection between the 2 September 1859 auroral storm and the Carrington\u2013Hodgson flare event when he observed that \"It is not impossible to suppose that in this case our luminary was taken \"in the act\".\" The second auroral event, which occurred on 2 September 1859, was a result of the (unseen) coronal mass ejection associated with the exceptionally intense Carrington\u2013Hodgson white light solar flare on 1 September 1859. This event produced auroras so widespread and extraordinarily bright that they were seen and reported in published scientific measurements, ship logs, and newspapers throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia. It was reported by \"The New York Times\" that in Boston on Friday 2 September 1859, the aurora was \"so brilliant that at about one o'clock ordinary print could be read by the light\". One o'clock EST time on Friday 2 September would have been 6:00 GMT; the self-recording magnetograph at the Kew Observatory was recording the geomagnetic storm, which was then one hour old, at its full intensity. Between 1859 and 1862, Elias Loomis published a series of nine papers on the Great Auroral Exhibition of 1859 in the \"American Journal of Science\" where he collected worldwide reports of the auroral event.\nThat aurora is thought to have been produced by one of the most intense coronal mass ejections in history. It is also notable for the fact that it is the first time that the phenomena of auroral activity and electricity were unambiguously linked. This insight was made possible not only due to scientific magnetometer measurements of the era but also as a result of a significant portion of the of telegraph lines then in service being significantly disrupted for many hours throughout the storm. Some telegraph lines, however, seem to have been of the appropriate length and orientation to produce a sufficient geomagnetically induced current from the electromagnetic field to allow for continued communication with the telegraph operator power supplies switched off. The following conversation occurred between two operators of the American Telegraph Line between Boston and Portland, Maine, on the night of 2 September 1859 and reported in the \"Boston Traveller\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Boston operator (to Portland operator):\" \"Please cut off your battery [power source] entirely for fifteen minutes.\"\n\"Portland operator:\" \"Will do so. It is now disconnected.\"\n\"Boston:\" \"Mine is disconnected, and we are working with the auroral current. How do you receive my writing?\"\n\"Portland:\" \"Better than with our batteries on. \u2013 Current comes and goes gradually.\"\n\"Boston:\" \"My current is very strong at times, and we can work better without the batteries, as the aurora seems to neutralize and augment our batteries alternately, making current too strong at times for our relay magnets. Suppose we work without batteries while we are affected by this trouble.\"\n\"Portland:\" \"Very well. Shall I go ahead with business?\"\n\"Boston:\" \"Yes. Go ahead.\"\nThe conversation was carried on for around two hours using no battery power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora, and it was said that this was the first time on record that more than a word or two was transmitted in such manner. Such events led to the general conclusion that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The effect of the Aurora on the electric telegraph is generally to increase or diminish the electric current generated in working the wires. Sometimes it entirely neutralizes them, so that, in effect, no fluid [current] is discoverable in them. The aurora borealis seems to be composed of a mass of electric matter, resembling in every respect, that generated by the electric galvanic battery. The currents from it change coming on the wires, and then disappear: the mass of the aurora rolls from the horizon to the zenith.In May 2024, a series of solar storms caused the aurora borealis to be observed from as far south as Ferdows, Iran.\nHistorical views and folklore.\nThe earliest datable record of an aurora was recorded in the \"Bamboo Annals\", a historical chronicle of the history of ancient China, in 977 or 957 BC.\nAn aurora was described by the Greek explorer Pytheas in the 4th century BC. Seneca wrote about auroras in the first book of his \"Naturales Quaestiones\", classifying them, for instance, as ('barrel-like'); ('chasm'); ('bearded'); ('like cypress trees'); and describing their manifold colours. He wrote about whether they were above or below the clouds and recalled that under Tiberius, an aurora formed above the port city of Ostia that was so intense and red that a cohort of the army, stationed nearby for fire duty, galloped to the rescue. It has been suggested that Pliny the Elder depicted the aurora borealis in his \"Natural History\" when he refers to , , \"falling red flames\", and \"daylight in the night\".\nThe earliest depiction of the aurora may have been in Cro-Magnon cave paintings of northern Spain dating to 30,000 BC.\nThe oldest known written record of the wintertime aurora was in a Chinese legend written around 2600 BC; an autumnal aurora is recorded centuries later, around 2000 BC. \nIn Japanese folklore, pheasants were considered messengers from heaven. However, researchers from Japan's Graduate University for Advanced Studies and the National Institute of Polar Research claimed in March 2020 that \"red pheasant tails\" witnessed across the nightsky over Japan in 620 A.D. might have been instead a red aurora produced during a magnetic storm.\nIn the traditions of Aboriginal Australians, the aurora australis is commonly associated with fire. For example, the Gunditjmara people of western Victoria called auroras ('ashes'), while the Gunai people of eastern Victoria perceived auroras as bushfires in the spirit world. The Dieri people of South Australia say that an auroral display is , an evil spirit creating a large fire. Similarly, the Ngarrindjeri people of South Australia refer to auroras seen over Kangaroo Island as the campfires of spirits in the 'Land of the Dead'. The Dieri and Ngarrindjeri communities in southwest Queensland believe the auroras to be the fires of the \"Oola Pikka\", ghostly spirits who spoke to the people through auroras. Sacred law forbade anyone except male elders from watching or interpreting the messages of ancestors they believed were transmitted through an aurora.\nAmong the M\u0101ori people of New Zealand, aurora australis or (\"great torches in the sky\") were lit by ancestors who sailed south to a \"land of ice\" (or their descendants); these people were said to be Ui-te-Rangiora's expedition party who had reached the Southern Ocean. around the 7th century.\nIn Scandinavia, the first mention of (the northern lights) is found in the Norwegian chronicle from AD 1230. The chronicler has heard about this phenomenon from compatriots returning from Greenland, and he gives three possible explanations: that the ocean was surrounded by vast fires; that the sun flares could reach around the world to its night side; or that glaciers could store energy so that they eventually became fluorescent.\nWalter William Bryant wrote in his book (1920) that Tycho Brahe \"seems to have been something of a hom\u0153opathist, for he recommends sulphur to cure infectious diseases 'brought on by the sulphurous vapours of the Aurora Borealis'\".\nIn 1778, Benjamin Franklin theorized in his paper \"Aurora Borealis, Suppositions and Conjectures towards forming a Hypothesis for its Explanation\" that an aurora was caused by a concentration of electrical charge in the polar regions intensified by the snow and moisture in the air:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;May not then the great quantity of electricity brought into the polar regions by the clouds, which are condensed there, and fall in the snow, which electricity would enter the earth, but cannot penetrate the ice; may it not, I say (as a bottle overcharged) break thro' that low atmosphere and run along in the vacuum over the air towards the equator, diverging as the degrees of longitude enlarge, strongly visible where densest, and becoming less visible as it more diverges; till it finds a passage to the earth in more temperate climates, or is mingled with the upper air?\nObservations of the rhythmic movement of compass needles due to the influence of an aurora were confirmed in the Swedish city of Uppsala by Anders Celsius and Olof Hiorter. In 1741, Hiorter was able to link large magnetic fluctuation to the observation of an aurora overhead. This evidence helped to support their theory that 'magnetic storms' are responsible for such compass fluctuations.\nA variety of Native American myths surround the spectacle. The European explorer Samuel Hearne travelled with Chipewyan Dene in 1771 and recorded their views on the ('caribou'). According to Hearne, the Dene people saw the resemblance between an aurora and the sparks produced when caribou fur is stroked. They believed that the lights were the spirits of their departed friends dancing in the sky, and when they shone brightly it meant that their deceased friends were very happy.\nDuring the night after the Battle of Fredericksburg, an aurora was seen from the battlefield. The Confederate Army took this as a sign that God was on their side, as the lights were rarely seen so far south. The painting \"Aurora Borealis\" by Frederic Edwin Church is widely interpreted to represent the conflict of the American Civil War.\nA mid-19th-century British source says auroras were a rare occurrence before the 18th century. It quotes Halley as saying that before the aurora of 1716, no such phenomenon had been recorded for more than 80 years, and none of any consequence since 1574. It says no appearance is recorded in the \"Transactions of the French Academy of Sciences\" between 1666 and 1716; and that one aurora recorded in \"Berlin Miscellany\" for 1797 was called a very rare event. One observed in 1723 at Bologna was stated to be the first ever seen there. Celsius (1733) states the oldest residents of Uppsala thought the phenomenon a great rarity before 1716. The period between approximately 1645 and 1715 corresponds to the Maunder minimum in sunspot activity.\nIn Robert W. Service's satirical poem \"\" (1908), a Yukon prospector discovers that the aurora is the glow from a radium mine. He stakes his claim, then goes to town looking for investors.\nIn the early 1900s, the Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland developed a theory foundational to the current understanding of geomagnetism and polar auroras.\nIn Sami mythology, the northern lights are caused by the deceased who bled to death cutting themselves, their blood spilling on the sky. Many aboriginal peoples of northern Eurasia and North America share similar beliefs of northern lights being the blood of the deceased, some believing they are caused by dead warriors' blood spraying on the sky as they engage in playing games, riding horses, or having fun in some other way.\nExtraterrestrial auroras.\nBoth Jupiter and Saturn have magnetic fields that are stronger than Earth's (Jupiter's equatorial field strength is 4.3 gauss, compared to 0.3 gauss for Earth), and both have extensive radiation belts. Auroras have been observed on both gas planets, most clearly using the Hubble Space Telescope, and the \"Cassini\" and \"Galileo\" spacecraft, as well as on Uranus and Neptune.\nThe auroras on Saturn seem, like Earth's, to be powered by the solar wind. However, Jupiter's auroras are more complex. Jupiter's main auroral oval is associated with the plasma produced by the volcanic moon Io, and the transport of this plasma within the planet's magnetosphere. An uncertain fraction of Jupiter's auroras are powered by the solar wind. In addition, the moons, especially Io, are also powerful sources of aurora. These arise from electric currents along field lines (\"field aligned currents\"), generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon. Io, which has active volcanism and an ionosphere, is a particularly strong source, and its currents also generate radio emissions, which have been studied since 1955. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, auroras over Io, Europa, and Ganymede have all been observed.\nAuroras have also been observed on Venus and Mars. Venus has no magnetic field so Venusian auroras appear as bright and diffuse patches of varying shape and intensity, sometimes distributed over the full disc of the planet. A Venusian aurora originates when electrons from the solar wind collide with the night-side atmosphere.\nAn aurora was detected on Mars, on 14 August 2004, by the SPICAM instrument aboard \"Mars Express\". The aurora was located at Terra Cimmeria, in the region of 177\u00b0 east, 52\u00b0 south. The total size of the emission region was about 30\u00a0km across, and possibly about 8\u00a0km high. By analysing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from the Mars Global Surveyor, scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized. This correlation indicated that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of Mars.\nBetween 2014 and 2016, cometary auroras were observed on comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko by multiple instruments on the Rosetta spacecraft. The auroras were observed at far-ultraviolet wavelengths. Coma observations revealed atomic emissions of hydrogen and oxygen caused by the photodissociation (not photoionization, like in terrestrial auroras) of water molecules in the comet's coma. The interaction of accelerated electrons from the solar wind with gas particles in the coma is responsible for the aurora. Since comet 67P has no magnetic field, the aurora is diffusely spread around the comet.\nExoplanets, such as hot Jupiters, have been suggested to experience ionization in their upper atmospheres and generate an aurora modified by weather in their turbulent tropospheres. However, there is no current detection of an exoplanet aurora.\nThe first ever extra-solar auroras were discovered in July 2015 over the brown dwarf star LSR J1835+3259. The mainly red aurora was found to be a million times brighter than the northern lights, a result of the charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the atmosphere. It has been speculated that stellar winds may be stripping off material from the surface of the brown dwarf to produce their own electrons. Another possible explanation for the auroras is that an as-yet-undetected body around the dwarf star is throwing off material, as is the case with Jupiter and its moon Io.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "49662", "revid": "45266726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49662", "title": "Pirelli", "text": "Italian multinational tyre manufacturer\nPirelli &amp; C. S.p.A. is an Italian multinational tyre manufacturer based in the city of Milan, Italy. The company, which has been listed on the Borsa Italiana since 1922, is the 5th-largest tyre manufacturer, and is focused on the consumer production of tyres for cars, motorcycles and bicycles. It is present in Europe, the Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, and the post-Soviet states, operating commercially in over 160 countries. It has 19 manufacturing sites, across 13 countries, and a network of around 14,600 distributors and retailers. \nPirelli has been sponsoring sport competitions since 1907 and is the exclusive tyre partner and supplier for the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series for 2008\u20132010, FIA Formula One World Championship for 2011\u2013present and for the FIM World Superbike Championship. Pirelli's headquarters are located in Milan's Bicocca district. Pirelli is now solely a tyre manufacturing company. In the past, it had been involved in fashion and operated in renewable energy and sustainable mobility.\nOn 4 October 2017, Pirelli returned to the Milan Stock Exchange after focusing its business on pure consumer products (tyres for car, motorcycles, and bicycles) and related services, and separating the business of industrial tyre. Pirelli's eponymous calendar has been published since 1964, and has featured the contributions of many famous photographers over the years such as Helmut Newton, Steve McCurry, Peter Lindbergh, Richard Avedon, Bruce Weber, Herb Rits, and Annie Leibovitz.\nIn 2015, China National Chemical Corp. Ltd. (ChemChina) took controlling interest of Pirelli; with the Chinese state-owned company agreeing to maintain the tyre company's ownership structure until 2023. In April 2025, the Board of Directors determined that ChemChina control over Pirelli had ended.\nHistory.\nFounded in Milan in 1872 by Giovanni Battista Pirelli (1848\u20131932), the company initially specialised in rubber and derivative processes and also made scuba diving rebreathers and dry suits used by Italian frogmen during World War II. Thereafter, Pirelli's activities were primarily focused on the production of tyre and cables (for energy and telecommunications). In 2005, Pirelli sold its cable division to Goldman Sachs, which changed the new group's name to Prysmian. In the 1950s, Alberto Pirelli commissioned the building of a skyscraper, Pirelli Tower, in the same Milanese area that housed the very first Pirelli factory during the 19th century.\nIn 1974, Pirelli invented the \"wide radial tyre\", upon a request from the Lancia rally racing team for a tyre strong enough to withstand the power of the new Lancia Stratos. At that time, racing tyres were either slick tyres made with the cross ply technique (very wide tyres with a reduced sidewall height), or radial tyres, which were too narrow to withstand the Stratos' power and did not provide enough grip. Both were unusable for the Lancia Stratos, as the radials were destroyed within 10\u00a0km, and the slicks too stiff. Lancia asked Pirelli for a solution, and in 1975 Pirelli created a wide tyre with a reduced sidewall height like a slick but with a radial structure. Subsequently, Porsche started using the same tyres with the Porsche 911 Turbo. In 1988, Pirelli acquired the Armstrong Rubber Company, which was headquartered in New Haven, Connecticut, US for $190 million.\nIn 2000, Pirelli sold its terrestrial fibre optic cables business to Cisco and its optical components operations to Corning, for 5 billion euro. It invested, through Olimpia, part of the resulting liquidity to become a majority shareholder in Telecom Italia in 2001, maintaining this position until 2007. In 2002 the company started a range of Pirelli-branded clothing, watches and eyewear. In 2005, Pirelli sold its Cables, Energy Systems and Telecommunications assets to Goldman Sachs and the newly formed company was named Prysmian. In the same year, 2005, Pirelli opened its first tyre production plant in Shandong province, China. This was the beginning of the group's production complex in the country. In 2006, Pirelli chose Slatina for its first tyre production plant in Romania, expanding the facility in 2011.\nIn 2010, Pirelli completed its conversion to a pure tyre company by selling Pirelli Broadband Solutions and spinning off the real estate assets of Pirelli Re. Fondazione Pirelli was established in the same year to safeguard and celebrate the company's past and to promote business culture as an integral part of Italy's national cultural assets. In March 2015, it was announced that Pirelli shareholders had accepted a \u20ac7.1 billion bid from ChemChina, together with Camfin and LTI, for the company. The transaction was completed and the company was delisted in November 2015. \nIn May 2017, it was announced that Pirelli returns to the world of cycling with a new road cycling tyre range, P ZERO Velo. In September 2017, the company announced its intentions to sell up to 40 per cent of its equity capital in an initial public offering as it plans to return to the Milan stock exchange in October. \nIn March 2019 Pirelli announced a new range of mountain biking tyres, called Scorpion. In 2021, Pirelli introduced 18-inch tyres for the new aerodynamic and technical changes for 2022 in Formula One. As of May 2024, Pirelli has a market capitalisation of $6.69 billion. On May 29, 2024 Silk Road Fund began the total sale of its shareholding.\nOn May 30, 2024, the share price fell as a result of the sale of the entire stake of Silk Road Fund. While Tronchetti Provera's Camfin strengthened its shareholding together with other Italian investors.\nIn April 2025, the Board of Directors, in compliance with the Italian government \"Decreto del Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri 4 agosto\" \"2023\" (DPCM) and the IFRS 10 international accounting principle, determined that Sinochem's control over Pirelli had ended.\nCorporate affairs.\nMajor shareholders.\nPirelli shareholders as of January 2025:\nBoard of directors.\nThe list of Pirelli Board of Directors as of April 2023:\nMarketing.\nThe Pirelli Calendar is published annually, featuring actresses and fashion models. The calendar also features the work of fashion photographers, including Richard Avedon, Peter Lindbergh, Annie Leibovitz, and Patrick Demarchelier. The Pirelli \"Internet\"ional Award is given annually for the best international multimedia involving the communication of science and technology conducted entirely on the Internet. \"Power is nothing without control\" was the well-known slogan of Pirelli Tyre Company, and was featured in numerous television and print advertisements. Pirelli is the long-serving main sponsor of Italian football club Inter Milan, having sponsored the Italian team since the 1995\u201396 season.\nSponsorship.\nFootball.\nPirelli has a history of sponsoring football teams. Pirelli is well known for its long-term primary sponsorship of the Italian football club Inter Milan between 1995 and 2021. Pirelli previously appeared as a sponsor on the shirts of the Maltese football club Valletta for a short time. In reference to Brazil striker Ronaldo\u2019s usual goal celebration of both arms outstretched, Pirelli ran a 1998 commercial in which he replaced the figure of Christ from the \"Christ the Redeemer\" statue that towers over his home city of Rio de Janeiro while in an Inter Milan strip. It was controversial with the Catholic Church.\nPirelli's sponsorship of football teams is not limited to Europe, South America is a key market and as a result, successful clubs have also been sponsored by the tyre company. The Brazilian team Palmeiras, Uruguayan team Pe\u00f1arol and Argentinian side V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield all had Pirelli as a shirt sponsor. When English football club Burton Albion Football Club built their new stadium in 2005, Pirelli became the title sponsor of the new ground. This was because the new stadium, named Pirelli Stadium lies next to the Pirelli factory in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England. In 2009, Pirelli became the title sponsor of the Chinese Super League (CSL), China's top-tier football league. In 2012, the company became a major sponsor of the Russian Cup.\nMotorsport.\nPirelli is the event title sponsor of the Spanish and Hungarian Grands Prix and sponsored the 2018 French Grand Prix. The company was the title sponsor of the Pirelli World Challenge from 2011 to 2018. Pirelli supported rally with their FIA Pirelli Star Driver program as an initiative to support young rally drivers. It was the sole supplier in the top tier of World Rally Championship in 2008\u20132010, and is now a co-supplier with Michelin. Since its first involvement in WRC in 1973, the manufacturer won 181 events, and produced 25 WRC Driver Champions including Colin McRae (1995), Petter Solberg (2003), S\u00e9bastien Loeb (2008\u20132010). Pirelli would again become the sole tyre supplier in all three tiers in 2021. Pirelli has also been a sponsor of rally and the late gymkhana driver Ken Block's Hoonigan Racing Division since 2010.\nAmerica's Cup.\nPirelli was sponsor of Emirates Team New Zealand in the 35th America's Cup (2017).\nWinter Sports.\nPirelli sponsored Alpine World Ski Championship and Ice Hockey World Championship IIHF from 2017 to 2021. The company is also sponsor of the Italian Ski Team and of the Swiss Ski Team.\nBaseball.\nPirelli also was a sponsor of the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball from 2014 to 2020.\nMotorsport.\nPirelli was the official tyre partner and supplier of the World Rally Championship from 2008 to 2010 until the company withdrew to focus on its Formula One commitments. Pirelli returned to the championship in 2014, albeit only partnering tyres for a few private teams as Michelin was the major tyre partner and supplier. Pirelli stepped up their involvement in the championship when they signed a deal to supply tyres to all Junior WRC participants, with its champions receiving a Ford Fiesta R5 with free tyres, fuel and free rally registration package for the next season's World Rally Championship-2. Pirelli subsequently returned full time to the WRC since 2021 season. Pirelli was also partnered Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series from 2008 until 2010 before being replaced by Continental AG in 2011. The company has been the official supplier of the GT World Challenge America since 2011 and the GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup since 2013.\nFormula One.\nPirelli has been the sole tyre supplier in Formula One since 2011 following Bridgestone's decision to withdraw from the role at the end of 2010. Pirelli previously competed in Formula One from 1950\u20131958, 1981\u20131986 and 1989\u20131991. Pirelli also supplies tyres for the FIA Formula 2 Championship (formerly GP2 Series), FIA Formula 3 Championship (formerly GP3 Series) and F1 Academy, that form the feeder series to Formula One. The 2025 Dutch Grand Prix marked Pirelli's 500th Grand Prix entry. Pirelli's deal is due to end after the 2027 Formula One World Championship.\nThe Italian tyre manufacturer introduced a colour coding system to help identify the tyre compounds used by drivers during races. Each compound has its own colour, which appears on the sidewalls of the tyre. Since the 2019 season, Pirelli has used three colours to identify its dry-weather P Zero tyres: white for hard, yellow for medium, and red for soft. As well as the dry-weather slick tyres, there are two wet-weather grooved tyres: green for the intermediate and blue for the full wet. These tyres are branded Cinturato, a name that dates back to the 1950s. At the start of Pirelli's Formula One tenure in 2011, the company was given the technically challenging task of designing tyres that degraded rapidly in order to promote more pit stops and overtaking, with the aim of making the races more exciting and entertaining. However, the brief from the sport's organisers has changed over the years, as the cars themselves evolved with the introduction of the turbo hybrid era in 2014.\nPirelli has faced controversy on a number of occasions in Formula One, especially during the 2013 British Grand Prix, which featured multiple tyre failures. Pirelli subsequently changed the construction of the tyres to prevent further incidents, switching to Kevlar belts. At the 2015 Belgian Grand Prix, a tyre on Sebastian Vettel's Ferrari suffered from a blowout at . Immediately after the race Pirelli claimed that excessive wear caused the blowout but following a more detailed analysis, the company said that in fact, a cut had caused the tyre failure. A number of major changes to the Formula One tyres were introduced for the 2017 season. The most obvious visual difference was an increase of width by 25%, both front and rear, increasing from 245-mm to 305-mm at the front and 325-mm to 405-mm at the rear. The actual rim size remained unchanged from the traditional 13 inches. The faster cornering speeds as a result of this change imposed significantly increased loads on the tyres. Pirelli was consequently asked to produce tyres with less degradation that were more resistant to overheating, for the fastest cars in Formula One history.\nA far-reaching alteration to the Formula One technical regulations for 2022, covering every aspect of the car, prompted another significant change to the tyres. With an imminent move to 18-inch rims after more than 50 years of the 13-inch size, Pirelli's 2022 tyres maintain the same tread width as before, but diameter has increased from 660 millimetres to 720 millimetres. The sidewall height is also reduced to give the tyres a more modern low-profile look.\nSuperbike World Championship.\nPirelli is the only allowed tyre brand in the FIM Superbike World Championship since 2004 (along with its support classes, such as the Supersport World Championship) until 2026. Pirelli has also been awarded the contract for the control tyre supply in the British Superbike Championship from 2008 until at least 2010.\nGrand Prix motorcycle racing.\nPirelli officially replaces Dunlop as the sole tyre supplier for Moto3 and Moto2 starting in 2024. This was announced by Dorna Sports via the official MotoGP website. The Pirelli and Dorna contract has a duration of three seasons.\nStarting from 2027 to 2031 seasons Pirelli will be official sole tyre partner and supplier to MotoGP premier class replacing Michelin after eleven seasons.\nSpeedboats.\nPirelli has partnered with Italian Boat Manufacture Sacs Tecnorib Spa to create the Pirelli Rigid inflatable Boat. They have models ranging from 30 to 50 feet, including small tenders (X and J Models).\nTheir most recent and popular collaboration has been with German Luxury Car Tuner Mansory. The new collaboration has been showcased to the public at the 2024 Cannes Boat Show and 2024 Genoa Boat Show.\nOverseas investment.\nIn April 2012, Pirelli &amp; C. SpA signed a joint venture agreement with Indonesian counterpart PT Astra Autoparts a subsidiary of PT Astra International for the construction of a motorcycle tyre plant with a total investment of $120 million. 60 per cent of shares will be held by Pirelli. Pirelli hoped to strengthen its presence in the largest motorcycle market in the world, Southeast Asia which has 250 million motorcycles.\nAudio system.\nIn July 2018, Pirelli launched a Formula One wheel-shaped Bluetooth speaker, P Zero Sound. The Bluetooth speaker measures in diameter, weighs and has a 100-watt amplifier, a mid-woofer, a tweeter and also offers Bluetooth 4.0 with AptX for wireless connectivity. IXOOST is the manufacturer of P Zero Sound speaker, which majorly manufactures Motorsports-themed audio systems. The wheel-shaped speaker costs \u20ac2400, which is equivalent to about $2,800.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "49668", "revid": "10202399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49668", "title": "Aurora (aircraft)", "text": "Rumored aircraft\nAurora is a rumored mid-1980s American reconnaissance aircraft. There is no substantial evidence that it was ever built or flown and it has been termed a myth.\nThe U.S. government has consistently denied such an aircraft was ever built. Aviation and space reference site \"Aerospaceweb.org\" concluded, \"The evidence supporting the Aurora is circumstantial or pure conjecture, there is little reason to contradict the government's position.\"\nFormer Skunk Works director Ben Rich confirmed that \"Aurora\" was simply a myth in \"Skunk Works\" (1994), a book detailing his days as the director. Rich wrote that a colonel working in the Pentagon arbitrarily assigned the name \"Aurora\" to the funding for the B-2 bomber design competition and somehow the name was leaked to the media.\nIn 2006, veteran black project watcher and aviation writer Bill Sweetman said, \"Does Aurora exist? Years of pursuit have led me to believe that, yes, Aurora is most likely in active development, spurred on by recent advances that have allowed technology to catch up with the ambition that launched the program a generation ago.\"\nBackground.\nThe Aurora legend started in 1985, when the \"Los Angeles Times\" and later \"Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology\" magazine broke the news that the term \"Aurora\" had been inadvertently included in the 1985 U.S. budget, as a requested allocation of $2.3 billion for \"black aircraft production\" in FY 1987. According to \"Aviation Week\", \"Project Aurora\" referred to a group of exotic aircraft, and not to one particular airframe. In the 1994 book \"Skunk Works\", Ben Rich, the former head of Lockheed's Skunk Works division, wrote that the Aurora was the budgetary code name for a component of the B-2 Spirit.\nEvidence.\nBy the late 1980s, many aerospace industry observers believed that the U.S. had the technological capability to build a Mach 5 (hypersonic speed) replacement for the aging Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. Detailed examinations of the U.S. defense budget claimed to have found money missing or channeled into black projects. By the mid-1990s, reports surfaced of sightings of unidentified aircraft flying over California and the United Kingdom involving odd-shaped contrails, sonic booms, and related phenomena that suggested the US had developed such an aircraft. Nothing ever linked any of these observations to any program or aircraft type, but the name Aurora was often tagged on these as a way of explaining the observations.\nBritish sighting claims.\nIn late August 1989, while working as an engineer on the jack-up barge \"GSF Galveston Key\" in the North Sea, Chris Gibson saw an unfamiliar isosceles triangle-shaped delta aircraft, apparently refueling from a Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker and accompanied by a pair of F-111 fighter-bombers. Gibson watched the aircraft for several minutes, until they went out of sight. He subsequently drew a sketch of the formation.\nWhen the sighting was made public in 1992, the British Defence Secretary Tom King was told, \"There is no knowledge in the MoD of a 'black' programme of this nature, although it would not surprise the relevant desk officers in the Air Staff and Defence Intelligence Staff if it did exist.\"\nGroup Captain Tom Eeles, RAF, writes of a mystery aircraft flying over his house, near to the Mildenhall USAF base in Suffolk, at about 2:00am on a Sunday morning in the autumn of 1993. He had been awoken by \"a very strange-sounding aircraft passing overhead; the engine noise was a pulsing sound quite unlike anything I'd heard before.\" He saw lights disappearing towards Mildenhall. Enquiries were made of a senior RAF officer at Mildenhall the following morning, at which point he was told firmly \"to stop making inquiries at once\". Group Captain Eeles attributes this sighting to a new stealth aircraft called Aurora. A few weeks earlier, there had been \"an unexplained incident at Boscombe Down apparently involving an emergency landing by an unknown US aircraft, after which it was covered in tarpaulins and removed with great secrecy by an American C5 transport aircraft.\"\nA crash at RAF Boscombe Down in Wiltshire on 26 September 1994 appeared closely linked to \"black\" missions, according to a report in \"AirForces Monthly\". Further investigation was hampered by USAF aircraft flooding into the base. Special Air Service personnel arrived in plainclothes in an Agusta 109. The crash site was protected from view by fire engines and tarpaulins and the base was closed to all flights soon afterwards. More recent analysis, however, indicates that the Boscombe Down crash was a towed missile decoy.\nAn unsubstantiated claim on the Horsted Keynes Village Web Site purports to show photos of the trail left after an unusual sonic boom was heard over the village in July 2002. In 2005 the information was used in a BBC report about the Aurora project.\nU.S. sighting claims.\nA series of unusual sonic booms was detected in Southern California beginning in mid-to-late 1991 and recorded by United States Geological Survey sensors across Southern California used to pinpoint earthquake epicenters. The sonic booms were characteristic of a smaller vehicle, rather than of the 37-meter long Space Shuttle orbiter. Furthermore, neither the Shuttle nor NASA's single SR-71B was operating on the days the booms had been registered. In the article, \"In Plane Sight?\" which appeared in the \"Washington City Paper\" on 3 July 1992 (pp.\u00a012\u201313), one of the seismologists, Jim Mori, noted: \"We can't tell anything about the vehicle. They seem stronger than other sonic booms that we record once in a while. They've all come on Thursday mornings about the same time, between 4 and 7.\" Former NASA sonic boom expert Dom Maglieri studied the 15-year-old sonic boom data from the California Institute of Technology and has deemed that the data showed \"something at 90,000\u00a0ft (c. 27\u00a0km), Mach 4 to Mach 5.2\". He also said the booms did not look like those from aircraft that had traveled through the atmosphere many miles away at Los Angeles International Airport; rather, they appeared to be booms from a high-altitude aircraft directly above the ground, moving at high speeds. The boom signatures of the two different aircraft patterns are wildly different. There was nothing particular to tie these events to any aircraft, but they served to increase the number of stories about the Aurora.\nOn 23 March 1992, near Amarillo, Texas, Steven Douglass photographed the \"donuts on a rope\" contrail and linked this sighting to distinctive sounds. He described the engine noise as: \"strange, loud pulsating roar... unique... a deep pulsating rumble that vibrated the house and made the windows shake... similar to rocket engine noise, but deeper, with evenly timed pulses.\" In addition to providing the first photographs of the distinctive contrail previously reported by many, the significance of this sighting was enhanced by Douglass' reports of intercepts of radio transmissions: \"Air-to-air communications... were between an AWACS aircraft with the call sign \"Dragnet 51\" from Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, and two unknown aircraft using the call signs \"Darkstar November\" and \"Darkstar Mike\". Messages consisted of phonetically transmitted alphanumerics. It is not known whether this radio traffic had any association with the \"pulser\" that had just flown over Amarillo.\" (\"Darkstar\" is also a call sign of AWACS aircraft from a different squadron at Tinker AFB) A month later, radio enthusiasts in California monitoring Edwards AFB Radar (callsign \"Joshua Control\") heard early morning radio transmissions between Joshua and a high flying aircraft using the callsign \"Gaspipe\". \"You're at 67,000 feet, 81 miles out\" was heard, followed by \"70 miles out now, 36,000 ft, above glideslope.\" As in the past, nothing linked these observations to any particular aircraft or program, but the attribution to the Aurora helped expand the legend.\nIn February 1994, a former resident of Rachel, Nevada, and Area 51 enthusiast, Chuck Clark, claimed to have filmed the Aurora taking off from the Groom Lake facility. In the David Darlington book \"\", he said:\nI even saw the Aurora take off one or an aircraft that matched the Aurora's reputed configuration: a sharp delta with twin tails about a hundred and thirty feet long. It taxied out of a lighted hangar at 2:30a.m. and used a lot of runway to take off. It had one red light on top, but the minute the wheels left the runway, the light went off and that was the last I saw of it. I didn't hear it because the wind was blowing from behind me toward the base.\" I asked when this had taken place. \"February 1994. Obviously they didn't think anybody was out there. It was thirty below zero \u2013 probably ninety below with the wind chill factor. I had hiked into White Sides from a different, harder way than usual, and stayed there two or three days among the rocks, under a camouflage tarp with six layers of clothes on. I had an insulated face mask and two sleeping bags, so I didn't present a heat signature. I videotaped the aircraft through a telescope with a five-hundred-millimeter f4 lens coupled via a C-ring to a high-eight digital video camera with five hundred and twenty scan lines of resolution, which is better than TV.\" The author then asked, \"Where's the tape?\" \"Locked away. That's a legitimate spyplane; my purpose is not to give away legitimate national defense. When they get ready to unveil it, I'll probably release the tape.\"\nAdditional claims.\nBy 1996, reports associated with the Aurora name dropped off in frequency, suggesting to people who believed that the aircraft existed that it had only ever been a prototype or that it had had a short service life.\nIn 2000, \"Aberdeen Press and Journal\" writer Nic Outterside wrote a piece on US stealth technology in Scotland. Citing confidential \"sources\", he alleged RAF/USAF Machrihanish in Kintyre, Argyll to be a base for Aurora aircraft. Machrihanish's almost long runway makes it suitable for high-altitude and experimental aircraft with the fenced-off coastal approach making it ideal for takeoffs and landings to be made well away from eyes or cameras of press and public. \"Oceanic Air Traffic Control at Prestwick,\" Outterside says, \"also tracked fast-moving radar blips. It was claimed by staff that a 'hypersonic jet was the only rational conclusion' for the readings.\"\nIn 2006, aviation writer Bill Sweetman put together 20 years of examining budget \"holes\", unexplained sonic booms, as well as the Gibson sighting and concluded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This evidence helps establish the program's initial existence. My investigations continue to turn up evidence that suggests current activity. For example, having spent years sifting through military budgets, tracking untraceable dollars and code names, I learned how to sort out where money was going. This year, when I looked at the Air Force operations budget in detail, I found a $9-billion black hole that seems a perfect fit for a project like Aurora.\nIn June 2017, \"Aviation Week\" reported that Rob Weiss, the General Manager of the Skunk Works, provided some confirmation of a research project and stated that hypersonic flight technology was now mature, and efforts were underway to fly an aircraft with it.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He played an important role in the dynastic struggle between rival factions of the Plantagenets now known as the Wars of the Roses.\nThough a member of the House of York, he switched sides to support the House of Lancaster, before reverting to the Yorkists. He was later convicted of treason against his elder brother, Edward IV, and executed, allegedly by drowning in malmsey wine. He appears as a character in William Shakespeare's plays \"Henry VI, Part 3\" and \"Richard III\", in which his death is attributed to the machinations of Richard.\nLife.\nGeorge was born on 21 October 1449 in Dublin at a time when his father, the Duke of York, had begun to challenge Henry VI for the crown. His godfather was James FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond. He was the second of the three sons of Richard and Cecily who survived their father and became a potential claimant for the crown. His father died in 1460. In 1461 his elder brother, Edward, became King of England as Edward IV and George was made Duke of Clarence. Despite his youth, he was appointed as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the same year.\nHaving been mentioned as a possible husband for Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, Clarence came under the influence of his first cousin Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, and in July 1469 was married in \u00c9glise Notre-Dame de Calais to the earl's elder daughter Isabel Neville.\nClarence had actively supported his elder brother's claim to the throne, but when his father-in-law (known as \"the Kingmaker\") deserted Edward IV to ally with Margaret of Anjou, consort of the deposed King Henry, Clarence supported him and was deprived of his office as Lord Lieutenant. Clarence joined Warwick in France, taking his pregnant wife. She gave birth to their first child, a girl, on 16 April 1470, in a ship off Calais. The child died shortly afterwards. Henry VI rewarded Clarence by making him next in line to the throne after his own son, justifying the exclusion of Edward IV both by attainder for his treason against the House of Lancaster as well as his alleged illegitimacy. After a short time, Clarence realized that his loyalty to his father-in-law was misplaced: Warwick had his younger daughter, Anne Neville, Clarence's sister-in-law, marry Henry VI's son in December 1470. This demonstrated that his father-in-law was less interested in making him king than in serving his own interests and, since it now seemed unlikely that Warwick would replace Edward IV with Clarence, Clarence was secretly reconciled with Edward.\nWarwick's efforts to keep Henry VI on the throne ultimately failed and Warwick was killed at the Battle of Barnet in April 1471. The re-instated King Edward IV restored his brother Clarence to royal favour by making him Great Chamberlain of England. As his father-in-law had died, Clarence became \"jure uxoris\" Earl of Warwick, but did not inherit the entire Warwick estate as his younger brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, had married (c.\u20091472) Anne Neville, who had been widowed in 1471. Edward intervened and eventually divided the estates between his brothers. Clarence was created, by right of his wife, first Earl of Warwick on 25 March 1472, and first Earl of Salisbury in a new creation.\nIn 1475 Clarence's wife Isabel gave birth to a son, Edward, later Earl of Warwick. Isabel died on 22 December 1476, two months after giving birth to a short-lived son named Richard (5 October 1476\u00a0\u2013 1 January 1477). George and Isabel are buried together at Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire. Their surviving children, Margaret and Edward, were cared for by their aunt, Anne Neville, until she died in 1485 when Edward was 10 years old.\nDeath.\nThough most historians now believe Isabel's death was a result of either consumption (tuberculosis) or childbed fever, Clarence was convinced she had been poisoned by one of her ladies-in-waiting, Ankarette Twynho, whom, as a consequence, he had judicially murdered in April 1477, by summarily arresting her and bullying a jury at Warwick into convicting her of murder by poisoning. She was hanged immediately after trial with John Thursby, a fellow defendant. She was posthumously pardoned in 1478 by King Edward. Clarence's mental state, never stable, deteriorated from that point and led to his involvement in yet another rebellion against his brother Edward.\nAccording to the bill of attainder passed against him, Clarence made a number of his servants swear personal loyalty to him and sent them into various parts of the kingdom to stir up rebellion against Edward, claiming that Edward intended to disinherit him and that he had used witchcraft to poison his subjects. It was also alleged that he had plotted to have a \"strange child\" pose as his son, while he intended to send his son into Ireland or Flanders to get assistance against Edward, but this plan was not successful. Clarence was also said to have secretly kept a document signed by Henry VI, specifying that Clarence was to become king in the event of his death.\nIn 1477 Clarence was again a suitor for the hand of Mary, who had just become duchess of Burgundy. Edward objected to the match, and Clarence left the court.\nThe arrest and committal to the Tower of London of one of Clarence's retainers, an Oxford astronomer named John Stacy, led to his confession under torture that he had \"imagined and compassed\" the death of the king, and used the black arts to accomplish this. He implicated Thomas Burdet, and Thomas Blake, a chaplain at Stacey's college (Merton College, Oxford).All three were tried for treason, convicted, and condemned to be drawn to Tyburn and hanged. Blake was saved at the eleventh hour by a plea for his life from James Goldwell, Bishop of Norwich, but the other two were put to death as ordered.\nThis was a clear warning to Clarence, which he chose to ignore. He appointed John Goddard to burst into Parliament and regale the House with Burdet and Stacy's declarations of innocence that they had made before their deaths. Goddard was a very unwise choice, as he was an ex-Lancastrian who had expounded Henry VI's claim to the throne. Edward summoned Clarence to Windsor, severely upbraided him, accused him of treason, and ordered his immediate arrest and confinement.\nClarence was imprisoned in the Tower of London and put on trial for treason against his brother Edward IV. Clarence was not present \u2013 Edward himself prosecuted his brother, and demanded that Parliament pass a bill of attainder against his brother, declaring that he was guilty of \"unnatural, loathly treasons\" which were aggravated by the fact that Clarence was his brother, who, if anyone did, owed him loyalty and love. Following his conviction and attainder, he was \"privately executed\" at the Tower on 18 February 1478, by tradition in the Bowyer Tower, and soon after the event, a rumour spread that he had been drowned in a butt of malmsey wine.\nA reason for Edward to have his brother executed may have been that George had \"threatened to question the legality of the royal marriage\" and he may have discovered from Bishop Robert Stillington of Bath and Wells that George \"had probably let slip the secret of the precontract\" for Edward's marriage with Lady Eleanor Talbot, although others dispute this.\nIn Shakespeare.\nClarence is a principal character in two of William Shakespeare's history plays: \"Henry VI, Part 3\" and \"Richard III.\" Shakespeare portrays Clarence as weak-willed and changeable. His initial defection from Edward IV to Warwick is prompted by resentment at the favours bestowed by Edward to the family of his queen Elizabeth Woodville. Despite several speeches proclaiming loyalty to Warwick, and to Henry VI, Clarence defects back to Edward's side when he sees his brothers again; it takes only a few lines for his brothers to shame him into rejoining the Yorkist party. Several lines reference his penchant for wine.\n\"Richard III\" opens with Gloucester having framed Clarence for treason, using a soothsayer to sow doubt in the King's mind about his brother, and in the first scene Clarence is arrested and taken to the Tower. Gloucester nimbly stage-manages Clarence's death, fast-tracking the order of execution and intercepting the King's pardon when Edward changes his mind. In Act One Scene Four, Clarence recounts a terrifying nightmare in which he has been pushed (accidentally) into the ocean by Gloucester and drowns, then finds himself in hell, accused of perjury by the ghosts of Warwick and Prince Edward. When he is attacked by assassins sent by Gloucester, he pleads eloquently and nobly but is stabbed and drowned in a butt of Malmsey wine. It is Clarence's death that sends Edward into a fatal attack of remorse. Clarence is the first character to die in the play; his ghost later appears to Gloucester, then already Richard III, and Henry Tudor, the future Henry VII of England, before the Battle of Bosworth Field, cursing his brother and encouraging Henry.\nChildren.\nClarence married Isabel Neville in Calais, at that time controlled by England, on 11 July 1469. Together they had four children:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of the leaders in the Wars of the Roses, originally on the Yorkist side but later switching to the Lancastrian side, he was instrumental in the deposition of two kings, which led to his epithet of \"Kingmaker\".\nThrough fortunes of marriage and inheritance, Warwick emerged in the 1450s at the centre of English politics. Originally, he was a supporter of King Henry VI; however, a territorial dispute with Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, led him to collaborate with Richard, Duke of York, in opposing the king. From this conflict, he gained the strategically valuable post of Captain of Calais, a position that benefited him greatly in the years to come. The political conflict later turned into a full-scale rebellion, where in battle York was slain, as was Warwick's father Salisbury. York's son, however, later triumphed with Warwick's assistance and was crowned King Edward IV. Edward initially ruled with Warwick's support, but the two later fell out over foreign policy and the king's choice to marry Elizabeth Woodville. After a failed plot to crown Edward's brother, George, Duke of Clarence, Warwick instead restored Henry VI to the throne. The triumph was short-lived, however: on 14\u00a0April 1471, Warwick was defeated by Edward at the Battle of Barnet, and killed.\nWarwick's historical legacy has been a matter of much dispute. Historical opinion has alternated between seeing him as self-centred and rash and regarding him as a victim of the whims of an ungrateful king. It is generally agreed, however, that in his own time, he enjoyed great popularity in all layers of society, and that he was skilled at appealing to popular sentiments for political support.\nBackground.\nThe Neville family, an ancient Durham family, came to prominence in England's fourteenth-century wars against the Scots. In 1397, King Richard II granted Ralph Neville the title of Earl of Westmorland. Ralph's son Richard, the later Earl of Warwick's father, was a younger son by a second marriage, and not heir to the earldom. He received a favourable settlement, however, and became \"jure uxoris\" (\"by right of his wife\") Earl of Salisbury through his marriage to Alice, daughter and heiress of Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury.\nSalisbury's son Richard, the later Earl of Warwick, was born on 22\u00a0November 1428; little is known of his childhood. At the age of eight, in 1436, Richard was married to Lady Anne Beauchamp, daughter of Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, and of his wife Isabel Despenser. This made him heir not only to the earldom of Salisbury, but also to a substantial part of the Montague, Beauchamp, and Despenser inheritance.\nCircumstances would, however, increase his fortune even further. Beauchamp's son Henry, who had married the younger Richard's sister Cecily, died in 1446. When Henry's daughter Anne died in 1449, Richard also found himself \"jure uxoris\" Earl of Warwick. Richard's succession to the estates did not go undisputed, however. A protracted battle over parts of the inheritance ensued, particularly with Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, who had married a daughter from Richard Beauchamp's first marriage. The dispute centred on land, not on the Warwick title, as Henry's half-sisters were excluded from the succession.\nBy 1445 Richard had become a knight, probably at Margaret of Anjou's coronation on 30\u00a0May that year; also around this time, his illegitimate daughter, Margaret (who married Richard Huddleston on 12 June 1464) was born.\nHe is visible in the historical record of the service of King Henry VI in 1449, which makes mention of his services in a grant. He performed military service in the north with his father and might have taken part in the war against Scotland in 1448\u20131449. When Richard, Duke of York, unsuccessfully rose up against the king in 1452, both Warwick and his father rallied to the side of King Henry VI.\nCivil war.\nDiscontent at court.\nIn June 1453, Somerset was granted custody of the lordship of Glamorgan\u2014part of the Despenser heritage held by Warwick until then\u2014and open conflict broke out between the two men. Then, in the summer of that year, King Henry fell ill. Somerset was a favourite of the king and Queen Margaret, and with the king incapacitated he was virtually in complete control of the government. This put Warwick at a disadvantage in his dispute with Somerset, and drove him into collaboration with York. The political climate, influenced by the , then started turning against Somerset. On 27\u00a0March 1454, a group of royal councillors appointed the Duke of York as protector of the realm. York could now count on the support not only of Warwick but also of Warwick's father Salisbury, who had become more deeply involved in disputes with the House of Percy in the north of England.\nYork's first protectorate did not last long. Early in 1455, the king rallied sufficiently to return to power, at least nominally, with Somerset again wielding real power. Warwick returned to his estates, as did York and Salisbury, and the three started raising troops. Marching towards London, they encountered the king at St Albans, where the two forces clashed. The battle was brief and not particularly bloody, but it was the first instance of armed hostilities between the forces of the Houses of York and Lancaster in the conflict known as the Wars of the Roses. It was also significant because it resulted in the capture of the king, and the death of Somerset.\nContinuation of hostilities.\nYork's second protectorate that followed was even shorter-lived than the first. At the parliament of February 1456 the king\u2014now under the influence of Queen Margaret\u2014resumed personal government of the realm. By this time Warwick had taken over Salisbury's role as York's main ally, even appearing at that same parliament to protect York from retributions. This conflict was also a pivotal period in Warwick's career, as it was resolved by his appointment as Constable of Calais. The post was to provide him with a vital power base in the following years of conflict. The continental town of Calais, conquered from France in 1347, was not only of vital strategic importance, it also held what was England's largest standing army. There were some initial disputes, with the garrison and with the royal wool monopoly, the Calais Staple, over payments in arrears, but in July Warwick finally took up his post.\nAfter the recent events, Queen Margaret still considered Warwick a threat to the throne, and cut off his supplies. In August 1457, however, a French attack on the English seaport of Sandwich set off fears of a full-scale French invasion. Warwick was again funded to protect the garrison and patrol the English coast. In disregard of royal authority, he then conducted highly successful acts of piracy, against the Castilian fleet in May 1458, and against the Hanseatic fleet a few weeks later. He also used his time on the Continent to establish relations with Charles VII of France and Philip the Good of Burgundy. Developing a solid military reputation and with good international connections, he then brought a part of his garrison to England, where he met up with his father and York in the autumn of 1459.\nYorkist Triumph.\nIn September 1459 Warwick crossed over to England and made his way north to Ludlow to meet up with York and Salisbury, the latter fresh from his victory over Lancastrians at the Battle of Blore Heath. At nearby Ludford Bridge their forces were scattered by the king's army, partly because of the defection of Warwick's Calais contingent under the command of Andrew Trollope. As it turned out, the majority of the soldiers were still reluctant to raise arms against the king. Forced to flee the country, York left for Dublin, Ireland, with his second son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, while Warwick and Salisbury sailed to Calais, accompanied by the Duke's son, Edward, Earl of March (the future King Edward IV). Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, was appointed to replace Warwick as Captain of Calais, but the Yorkists managed to hold on to the garrison.\nIn March 1460 Warwick visited York in Ireland to plan the way ahead and returned to Calais. Then, on 26\u00a0June, he landed at Sandwich with Salisbury and March, and from here the three earls rode north to London. Salisbury was left to besiege the Tower of London, while Warwick took March with him in pursuit of the king. At Northampton, on 10\u00a0July, King Henry was taken captive, while Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham and others were killed in battle.\nIn September York arrived from Ireland, and at the parliament of October that year, the Duke walked up to the throne and put his hand on it. The act, signifying usurpation, left the assembly in shock. It is unclear whether Warwick had prior knowledge of York's plans, though it is assumed that this had been agreed upon between the two in Ireland the previous March. It soon became clear, however, that this regime change was unacceptable to the lords in parliament, and a compromise was agreed. The Act of Accord of 25\u00a0October 1460 stated that while Henry VI was allowed to stay on the throne for the remainder of his life, his son Edward, Prince of Wales, was to be disinherited. Instead, York would succeed the king, and act as protector.\nThis solution was not ideal to either party, and further conflict was inevitable. On 30\u00a0December, at the Battle of Wakefield, York was killed, as were York's second son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, and Warwick's younger brother Thomas. Salisbury was executed a day later. Warwick marched north to confront the enemy, but was defeated and forced to flee at the Second Battle of St Albans. He then joined forces with Prince Edward of York, the new Yorkist claimant to the crown, who had just won an important victory at the Battle of Mortimer's Cross.\nWhile Queen Margaret was hesitating to make her next move, Warwick and Edward hastened to London. The citizens of the capital were scared by the brutal conduct of the Lancastrian forces, and were sympathetic to the House of York. On 4\u00a0March the prince was proclaimed King Edward IV by an assembly that gathered quickly. The new king now headed north to consolidate his title and met with the Lancastrian forces at Towton in Yorkshire. Warwick had suffered an injury to the leg the day before, in the Battle of Ferrybridge, and may have played only a minor part in the battle that followed. The unusually bloody battle resulted in a complete victory for the Yorkist forces, and the death of many important men on the opposing side, such as Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, and Andrew Trollope. Queen Margaret managed to escape to Scotland, with Henry and Prince Edward. Edward IV returned to London for his coronation, while Warwick remained to pacify the north.\nIn power.\nWarwick's apex.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"They have but two rulers, M. de Warwick and another whose name I have forgotten.\"\n \u2014The Governor of Abbeville in a letter to Louis XI\nWarwick's position after the accession of Edward IV was stronger than ever. He had now succeeded to his father's possessions\u2014including his vast network of retainers\u2014and in 1462 he also inherited his mother's lands and the Salisbury title. Altogether, he had an annual income from his lands of over \u00a37,000, far more than any other man in the realm but the king. Edward confirmed Warwick's position as Captain of Calais, and made him High Admiral of England and Steward of the Duchy of Lancaster, along with several other offices. His brothers also benefited: John Neville, Lord Montagu, was made Warden of the East March in 1463, and the next year created Earl of Northumberland. George Neville, Bishop of Exeter, was confirmed in his post as chancellor by King Edward, and in 1465 promoted to the archbishopric of York.\nBy late 1461, risings in the north had been put down, and in the summer of 1462, Warwick negotiated a truce with Scotland. In October the same year, Margaret of Anjou invaded England with troops from France, and managed to take the castles of Alnwick and Bamburgh. Warwick had to organise the recapture of the castles, which was accomplished by January 1463. The leaders of the rebellion, including Ralph Percy, were pardoned and left in charge of the retaken castles. At this point, Warwick felt secure enough to travel south; in February he buried the remains of his father and brother at Bisham Priory, and in March he attended parliament at Westminster.\nThat same spring, however, the north rose up in rebellion once more, when Ralph Percy laid siege to Norham Castle. Warwick returned to the north and rescued Norham in July, but the Lancastrians were left in possession of Northumberland, and the government decided on a diplomatic approach instead. Separate truces were negotiated with Scotland and France by late 1463, which allowed Warwick to retake the Northumbrian castles held by the Lancastrian rebels in the spring of 1464. This time no clemency was given, and around thirty of the rebel leaders were executed.\nEarly tensions.\nAt the negotiations with the French, Warwick had intimated that King Edward was interested in a marriage arrangement with the French crown, the intended bride being Louis XI's sister-in-law, Bona, daughter of Louis, Duke of Savoy. This marriage was not to be, however, because in September 1464, Edward revealed that he was already married, to Elizabeth Woodville. The marriage caused great offence to Warwick: not only due to the fact that his plans had been sabotaged, but also the secrecy with which the king had acted. The marriage\u2014contracted on 1\u00a0May of the same year\u2014was not made public before Warwick pressed Edward on the issue at a council meeting, and in the meanwhile, Warwick had been unknowingly deceiving the French into believing the king was serious about the marriage proposal. For Edward the marriage may very well have been a love match, but in the long run, he sought to build the Woodville family into a powerhouse independent of Warwick's influence. The marriage of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville caused Warwick to lose his power and influence. He accused Elizabeth, and her mother Jacquetta of Luxembourg, of witchcraft to try to restore the power that he had lost.\nThis was not enough to cause a complete fallout between the two men, though from this point on Warwick increasingly stayed away from court. The promotion of Warwick's brother George to Archbishop of York shows that the earl was still in favour with the king. In July 1465, when Henry VI was once more captured, it was Warwick who escorted the fallen king to his captivity in the Tower.\nThen, in the spring of 1466, Warwick was sent to the continent to carry out negotiations with the French and Burgundians. The negotiations centred around a marriage proposal involving Edward's sister Margaret. Warwick increasingly came to favour French diplomatic connections. Meanwhile, Edward's father-in-law, Richard Woodville, Earl Rivers, who had been created treasurer, was in favour of a Burgundian alliance. This set up an internal conflict within the English court, which was not alleviated by the fact that Edward had signed a secret treaty in October with Burgundy, while Warwick was forced to carry on sham negotiations with the French. Later, George Neville was dismissed as chancellor, while Edward refused to contemplate a marriage between Warwick's oldest daughter Isabel, and Edward's brother George, Duke of Clarence. It became increasingly clear that Warwick's position of dominance at court had been taken over by Rivers.\nIn the autumn of 1467, there were rumours that Warwick was now sympathetic to the Lancastrian cause, but even though he refused to come to court to answer the charges, the king accepted his denial in writing. In July 1468, it was revealed that Warwick's deputy in Calais, John, Lord Wenlock, was involved in a Lancastrian conspiracy, and early in 1469 another Lancastrian plot was uncovered, involving John de Vere, Earl of Oxford. It was becoming clear that the discontent with Edward's reign was widespread, a fact that Warwick could exploit.\nDefection.\nRebellion.\nWarwick now orchestrated a rebellion in Yorkshire while he was away, led by a \"Robin of Redesdale\". Part of Warwick's plan was winning over King Edward's younger brother, George Plantagenet, possibly with the prospect of installing him on the throne. The nineteen-year-old George had shown himself to share many of the abilities of his older brother but was also jealous and overambitious. \nIn July 1469, the two sailed over to Calais, where George was married to Warwick's daughter, Lady Isabel Neville. From there, they returned to England, where they gathered the men of Kent to join the rebellion in the north. Meanwhile, the king's forces were defeated at the Battle of Edgecote, where William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, was killed. The other commander, Humphrey Stafford, Earl of Devon, was caught in flight and lynched by a mob. Later, Earl Rivers and his son, John Woodville, were also apprehended and murdered. With his army now defeated, King Edward IV was taken under arrest by George Neville. Warwick then imprisoned the king in Warwick Castle, and in August, the king was taken north to Middleham Castle. In the long run, however, it proved impossible to rule without the king, and continuing disorder forced Warwick to release King Edward IV in September 1469.\nA \"modus vivendi\" had been achieved between Warwick and the king for some months, but the restoration of Henry Percy to Montagu's earldom of Northumberland prevented any chance of full reconciliation. A trap was set for the king when disturbances in Lincolnshire led him north, where he could be confronted by Warwick's men. Edward, however, discovered the plot when Robert, Lord Welles, was routed at Losecote Field in Rutland in March 1470, and gave away the plan.\nWarwick soon gave up, and once more fled the country with Clarence. Denied access to Calais, they sought refuge with King Louis XI of France. Louis arranged a reconciliation between Warwick and Margaret of Anjou, and as part of the agreement, Margaret and Henry's son, Edward, Prince of Wales, would marry Warwick's daughter Anne. The objective of the alliance was to restore Henry VI to the throne. Again, Warwick staged an uprising in the north, and with the king away, he and Clarence landed at Dartmouth and Plymouth on 13\u00a0September 1470. \nAmong the many who flocked to Warwick's side was his brother Montagu, who had not taken part in the last rebellion, but was disappointed when his loyalty to the king had not been rewarded with the restoration of his earldom. This time the trap set up for the king worked; as Edward hurried south, Montagu's forces approached from the north, and the king found himself surrounded. On 2\u00a0October he fled to Flanders, a part of the Duchy of Burgundy. King Henry was now restored, with Warwick acting as the true ruler in his capacity as lieutenant. At a parliament in November, Edward was attainted of his lands and titles, and Clarence was awarded the Duchy of York.\nDeath.\nAt this point, international affairs intervened. Louis XI declared war on Burgundy, and Charles the Bold responded by granting an expeditionary force to Edward IV, in order to reclaim his throne. On 14\u00a0March 1471, Edward landed at Ravenspurn in Yorkshire, with the acquiescence of the Earl of Northumberland. Warwick was still waiting for Queen Margaret and her son Edward, who were supposed to bring reinforcements from France but were kept on the continent by bad weather. At this point, Edward received the support of his brother Clarence, who realised that he had been disadvantaged by the new agreement with the Lancastrians. Clarence's defection weakened Warwick, who nevertheless went in pursuit of Edward. On 14\u00a0April 1471 the two armies met at Barnet. Fog and poor visibility on the field led to confusion, and the Lancastrian army ended up attacking its own men. In the face of defeat Warwick attempted to escape the field but was struck off his horse and killed.\nAftermath.\nWarwick's body\u2014along with that of his brother Montagu, who had also fallen at Barnet\u2014was displayed in London's St Paul's Cathedral to quell any rumours of their survival. Then they were handed over to Archbishop Neville, to be buried in the family vault at Bisham Priory near the river Thames in Berkshire. No trace now remains of either the tomb or the church in which it was housed. On 4\u00a0May 1471, Edward IV defeated the remaining Lancastrian forces of Queen Margaret and Prince Edward at the Battle of Tewkesbury, where the prince was killed. Soon afterwards, it was reported that King Henry VI had also died in the Tower. With the direct Lancastrian line exterminated, Edward could reign safely until his death in 1483.\nWarwick had no sons. His offices were divided between King Edward's brothers George, Duke of Clarence (who had married Warwick's daughter Isabel Neville), and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, the future Richard III (who would marry Warwick's daughter Anne Neville). Clarence received the chamberlainship of England and the lieutenancy of Ireland, while Gloucester was made Admiral of England and Warden of the West March. Clarence also received the earldoms of Warwick and Salisbury. The earl's land had been forfeited and taken into the king's custody. When Gloucester married Warwick's younger daughter Anne in 1472, who had been recently widowed by the death of Prince Edward, a dispute broke out between the two princes over the Beauchamp and Despenser inheritances. A compromise was eventually reached, whereby the land was divided, but Clarence was not pacified. In 1477 he once again plotted against his brother. This time the king could no longer act with lenience, and the next year the Duke of Clarence was executed.\nLegacy.\nAssessment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Thou setter-up and plucker-down of kings\"\n\u2014 William Shakespeare; Henry VI\nEarly sources on Richard Neville fall into two categories. The first are the sympathetic chronicles of the early Yorkist years, or works based on these, such as the \"Mirror for Magistrates\" (1559). The other category originates with chronicles commissioned by Edward IV after Warwick's fall, such as the \"Historie of the arrivall of Edward IV\", and take a more negative view of the earl. The \"Mirror\" portrayed Warwick as a great man: beloved by the people, and betrayed by the man he helped raise to the throne. The other perspective can be found in Shakespeare's \"Henry VI\" trilogy: a man driven by pride and egotism, who created and deposed kings at will.\nIn time, however, it is the latter view that dominated. The Enlightenment, or Whig historians of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, decried anyone who impeded the development towards a centralised, constitutional monarchy, the way Warwick did in his struggles with Edward. David Hume called Warwick \"the greatest, as well as the last, of those mighty barons who formerly overawed the crown, and rendered the people incapable of any regular system of civil government.\" Later writers were split between admiration for some of Warwick's character traits, and condemnation of his political actions. The romantic novelist Lord Lytton picked up on Hume's theme in his \"The Last of the Barons\". Though Lytton portrayed Warwick as a tragic hero who embodied the ideals of chivalry, he was nevertheless one whose time was past. The late-nineteenth-century military historian Charles Oman acknowledged the earl's ability to appeal to popular sentiments, yet pointed out his deficiencies as a military commander. Oman found Warwick a traditional strategist, \"not attaining the heights of military genius displayed by his pupil Edward.\" Paul Murray Kendall's popular biography from 1957 took a sympathetic view of Warwick but concluded that he had ultimately fallen victim to his own overreaching ambition.\nMore recent historians, such as Michael Hicks and A. J. Pollard, have tried to see Warwick in light of the standards of his own age, rather than holding him up to contemporary constitutional ideals. The insults Warwick suffered at the hands of King Edward\u2014including Edward's secret marriage, and the refusal of the French diplomatic channel\u2014were significant. His claim to prominence in national affairs was not a product of illusions of grandeur; it was confirmed by the high standing he enjoyed among the princes on the continent. Furthermore, Warwick's cause was not considered unjust by his contemporaries, which can be seen by the earl's popularity exceeding that of the king at the time of his first rebellion in 1469. On the other hand, while Warwick could not easily suffer his treatment by the king, it was equally impossible for Edward to accept the earl's presence on the political scene. As long as Warwick remained as powerful and influential as he was, Edward could not fully assert his royal authority, and eventual confrontation became inevitable.\nHowever, the memories written in Burgundy had a negative view of him. For example, according to Philippe de Commynes and Olivier de la Marche, Georges Chastellain, who all mention Edward's popularity and character, Warwick was sage and cunning, and much richer than Edward, but he was very hated. In addition, unlike his brother John Nevill and Edward, he was not brave. A Burgundy historian Jean de Wavrin criticized him more bitterly than other Burgundians.\nCoat of arms.\nThe Earl of Warwick's coat of arms was unusually complex for the period, with seven different quarterings in an unusual order. The first grand quarter consists of the arms of his father-in-law, Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, who bore his arms quartering Despenser (the arms of his wife Isabel le Despenser) with an inescutcheon of De Clare, which Warwick showed in the fourth quarter. The second grand quarter showed the arms of Montagu (quartering Monthermer). The third grand quarter showed the arms of Neville differenced \u2013 rather honourably augmented \u2013 by a label \"compony argent and azure\" for Beaufort (House of Lancaster) to signify the royal descent from Warwick's father Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, who was the eldest son and heir of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland and his wife, Lady Joan Beaufort, daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, third son of King Edward III and great-grandfather of the last Lancastrian King Henry VI.\nNeville family tree.\n&lt;section begin=FamilyTree /&gt; \nThe chart below shows, in abbreviated form, the family background of Richard Neville and his family connections with the houses of York and Lancaster.

American English dialects\nCanadian raising (also sometimes known as English diphthong raising) is an allophonic rule of phonology in many varieties of North American English that changes the pronunciation of diphthongs with open-vowel starting points. Most commonly, the shift affects or , or both, when they are pronounced before voiceless consonants (therefore, in words like \"price\" and \"clout\", respectively, but not in \"prize\" and \"cloud\"). In North American English, and usually begin in an open vowel [~], but through raising they shift to , or . Canadian English often has raising in words with both (\"height, life, psych, type\", etc.) and (\"clout, house, south, scout,\" etc.), while a number of American English varieties (such as Inland North, Western New England, and increasingly more General American accents) have this feature in but not . It is thought to have originated in Canada in the late 19th century.\nIn the U.S., \"aboot\" , an exaggerated version of the raised pronunciation of \"about\" , is a stereotype of Canadian English.\nAlthough the symbol \u27e8\u028c\u27e9 is defined as an open-mid back unrounded vowel in the International Phonetic Alphabet, \u27e8\u028c\u026a\u27e9 or \u27e8\u028c\u028a\u27e9 may signify any raised vowel that contrasts with unraised or , when the exact quality of the raised vowel is not important in the given context.\nDescription.\nPhonetic environment.\nIn general, Canadian raising affects vowels before voiceless consonants like , , , and . Vowels before voiced consonants like , , , and are usually not raised. Furthermore, it usually only happens within syllable boundaries. It has also been described as being blocked when the diphthong has less than primary stress and is immediately followed by a stressed syllable, resulting in a lack of raising in words like \"psychology, citation\" and \"micrometer\", but raising in \"Psyche, cite,\" and \"microphone\". This can be further explained with syllable structure or feet.\nHowever, several studies indicate that this rule is not completely accurate, and have attempted to formulate different rules.\nA study of three speakers in Meaford, Ontario, showed that pronunciation of the diphthong fell on a continuum between raised and unraised. Raising is influenced by voicing of the following consonant, but it may also be influenced by the sound before the diphthong. Frequently the diphthong was raised when preceded by a coronal: in \"gigantic\", \"dinosaur\", and \"Siberia\".\nRaising before , as in \"wire\", \"iris\", and \"fire\", has been documented in some American accents.\nRaising can apply to compound words. Hence, the first vowel in \"high school\" as a term meaning \"a secondary school for students approximately 14\u201318 years old\" may be raised, whereas \"high school\" with the literal meaning of \"a school that is high (e.g. in elevation)\" is unaffected. (The two terms are also distinguished by the position of the stress accent, as shown.) The same is true of \"high chair\".\nHowever, frequently it does not. One study of speakers in Rochester, New York and Minnesota found a very inconsistent pattern of raising before voiceless consonants in certain prefixes; for example, the numerical prefix \"bi-\" was raised in \"bicycle\" but not \"bisexual\" or \"bifocals\". Likewise, the vowel was consistently kept low when used in a prefix in words like \"dichotomy\" and \"anti-Semitic\". This pattern may have to do with stress or familiarity of the word to the speaker; however, these relations are still inconsistent.\nIn most dialects of North American English, intervocalic and are pronounced as an alveolar flap when the following vowel is unstressed or word-initial, a phenomenon known as \"flapping\". In accents with both flapping and Canadian raising, or before a flapped may still be raised, even though the flap is a voiced consonant. Hence, while in accents without raising, \"writer\" and \"rider\" are pronounced differently as a result of a slight difference in vowel length due to pre-fortis clipping, in accents with raising, the words may be distinguished by their vowels: \"writer\" , \"rider\" . In accents where raising applies to , \"pouter\" and \"powder\" are similarly distinct: \"pouter\" , \"powder\" .\nResult.\nThe raised variant of typically becomes . In most of Canada, the raised vowel is further front than , and in traditional New York City English, is backed towards except before voiceless consonants, resulting in a distinction based more on frontness, but in Philadelphia it may be more back.\nThe raised variant of varies by dialect, with more common in Western Canada and a fronted variant commonly heard in Central Canada. In any case, the open vowel component of the diphthongs changes to a mid vowel (, , or ).\nGeographic distribution.\nInside Canada.\nAs its name implies, Canadian raising is found throughout most of Canada, though the exact phonetic quality of Canadian raising may differ throughout the country. In raised , the first element tends to be farther back in Quebec and the Canadian Prairies (particularly in Alberta) and Maritimes: thus, . The first element tends to be the farthest forward in eastern and southern Ontario: thus, . Newfoundland English is the Canadian dialect that participates least in any conditioned Canadian raising, while Vancouver English may lack the raising of in particular.\nOutside Canada.\nCanadian raising is not restricted to Canada. Raising of both and is common in eastern New England, for example in some Boston accents (the former more likely than the latter), as well as in the Upper Midwest. South Atlantic English, New Orleans English, and the accents of England's Fens feature it as well. Raisin\u0261 of before voiceless consonants is found in Wisbech, March, and Chatteris in the Central Fens and King's Lynn, Downham Market, and Ely in the Eastern Fens but not in the Western Fens.\nRaising of just is found in a much greater number of dialects in the United States; some researchers have begun to refer to raising of without raising of as American Raising. This phenomenon is most consistently found in the Inland North, the Upper Midwest, New England, New York City, and the mid-Atlantic areas of Pennsylvania (including Philadelphia), Maryland, and Delaware, as well as in Virginia. It is somewhat less common in the lower Midwest, the West, and the South. However, there is considerable variation in the raising of , and it can be found inconsistently throughout the United States.\nRaising in other environments.\nRaising of before certain voiced consonants is most prominent in the Inland North, Western New England, and Philadelphia. It has been noted to occur before , and especially. Hence, words like \"tiny\", \"spider\", \"cider\", \"tiger\", \"dinosaur\", \"cyber-\", \"beside\", \"idle\" (but sometimes not \"idol\"), and \"fire\" may contain a raised nucleus. (Also note that in six of those nine words, is preceded by a coronal consonant; see above paragraph. In five [or possibly six] of those nine words, the syllable after the syllable with contains a liquid.) The use of rather than in such words is unpredictable from phonetic environment alone, though it may have to do with their acoustic similarity to other words that \"do\" contain before a voiceless consonant, per the traditional Canadian-raising system. Hence, some researchers have argued that there has been a phonemic split in these dialects; the distribution of the two sounds is becoming more unpredictable among younger speakers.\nThe raising of is also present in Ulster English, spoken in the northern region of the island of Ireland, in which is split between the sound (before voiced consonants or in final position) and the sound (before voiceless consonants but also sometimes in any position); phonologist Raymond Hickey has described this Ulster raising as \"embryonically the situation\" for Canadian raising.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

More simply, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of terms and relational expressions that represent the entities in that subject area. The field which studies ontologies so conceived is sometimes referred to as \"applied ontology\".\nEvery academic discipline or field, in creating its terminology, thereby lays the groundwork for an ontology. Each uses ontological assumptions to frame explicit theories, research and applications. Improved ontologies may improve problem solving within that domain, interoperability of data systems, and discoverability of data. Translating research papers within every field is a problem made easier when experts from different countries maintain a controlled vocabulary of jargon between each of their languages. For instance, the definition and ontology of economics is a primary concern in Marxist economics, but also in other subfields of economics. An example of economics relying on information science occurs in cases where a simulation or model is intended to enable economic decisions, such as determining what capital assets are at risk and by how much (see risk management).\nWhat ontologies in both information science and philosophy have in common is the attempt to represent entities, including both objects and events, with all their interdependent properties and relations, according to a system of categories. In both fields, there is considerable work on problems of ontology engineering (e.g., Quine and Kripke in philosophy, Sowa and Guarino in information science), and debates concerning to what extent normative ontology is possible (e.g., foundationalism and coherentism in philosophy, BFO and Cyc in artificial intelligence).\nApplied ontology is considered by some as a successor to prior work in philosophy. However many current efforts are more concerned with establishing controlled vocabularies of narrow domains than with philosophical first principles, or with questions such as the mode of existence of fixed essences or whether enduring objects (e.g., perdurantism and endurantism) may be ontologically more primary than processes. Artificial intelligence has retained considerable attention regarding applied ontology in subfields like natural language processing within machine translation and knowledge representation, but ontology editors are being used often in a range of fields, including biomedical informatics, industry. Such efforts often use ontology editing tools such as Prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\nOntology in philosophy.\nOntology is a branch of philosophy and intersects areas such as metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of language, as it considers how knowledge, language, and perception relate to the nature of reality. Metaphysics deals with questions like \"what exists?\" and \"what is the nature of reality?\". One of five traditional branches of philosophy, metaphysics is concerned with exploring existence through properties, entities and relations such as those between particulars and universals, intrinsic and extrinsic properties, or essence and existence. Metaphysics has been an ongoing topic of discussion since recorded history.\nEtymology.\nThe compound word \"ontology\" combines \"onto-\", from the Greek \u1f44\u03bd, \"on\" (gen. \u1f44\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, \"ontos\"), i.e. \"being; that which is\", which is the present participle of the verb \u03b5\u1f30\u03bc\u03af, \"eim\u00ed\", i.e. \"to be, I am\", and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1, \"-logia\", i.e. \"logical discourse\", see classical compounds for this type of word formation.\nWhile the etymology is Greek, the oldest extant record of the word itself, the Neo-Latin form \"ontologia\", appeared in 1606 in the work \"Ogdoas Scholastica\" by Jacob Lorhard (\"Lorhardus\") and in 1613 in the \"Lexicon philosophicum\" by Rudolf G\u00f6ckel (\"Goclenius\").\nThe first occurrence in English of \"ontology\" as recorded by the \"OED\" (\"Oxford English Dictionary\", online edition, 2008) came in \"Archeologia Philosophica Nova\" or \"New Principles of Philosophy\" (1663) by Gideon Harvey.\nFormal ontology.\nSince the mid-1970s, researchers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have recognized that knowledge engineering is the key to building large and powerful AI systems. AI researchers argued that they could create new ontologies as computational models that enable certain kinds of automated reasoning, which was only marginally successful. In the 1980s, the AI community began to use the term \"ontology\" to refer to both a theory of a modeled world and a component of knowledge-based systems. In particular, David Powers introduced the word \"ontology\" to AI to refer to real world or robotic grounding, publishing in 1990 literature reviews emphasizing grounded ontology in association with the call for papers for a AAAI Summer Symposium Machine Learning of Natural Language and Ontology, with an expanded version published in SIGART Bulletin and included as a preface to the proceedings. Some researchers, drawing inspiration from philosophical ontologies, viewed computational ontology as a kind of applied philosophy.\nIn 1993, the widely cited web page and paper \"Toward Principles for the Design of Ontologies Used for Knowledge Sharing\" by Tom Gruber used \"ontology\" as a technical term in computer science closely related to earlier idea of semantic networks and taxonomies. Gruber introduced the term as \"a specification of a conceptualization\": An ontology is a description (like a formal specification of a program) of the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community of agents. This definition is consistent with the usage of ontology as set of concept definitions, but more general. And it is a different sense of the word than its use in philosophy.\nAttempting to distance ontologies from taxonomies and similar efforts in knowledge modeling that rely on classes and inheritance, Gruber stated (1993): Ontologies are often equated with taxonomic hierarchies of classes, class definitions, and the subsumption relation, but ontologies need not be limited to these forms. Ontologies are also not limited to \"conservative definitions\", that is, definitions in the traditional logic sense that only introduce terminology and do not add any knowledge about the world (Enderton, 1972). To specify a conceptualization, one needs to state axioms that \"do\" constrain the possible interpretations for the defined terms.\nRecent experimental ontology frameworks have also explored resonance-based AI-human co-evolution structures, such as IAMF (Illumination AI Matrix Framework) and OntoMotoOS (a meta-operating system concept for ethical and ontological AI-human co-evolution). Though not yet widely adopted in academic discourse, such models propose phased approaches to ethical harmonization and structural emergence.\nAs refinement of Gruber's definition Feilmayr and W\u00f6\u00df (2016) stated: \"An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization that is characterized by high semantic expressiveness required for increased complexity.\"\nFormal ontology components.\nContemporary ontologies share many structural similarities, regardless of the language in which they are expressed. Most ontologies describe individuals (instances), classes (concepts), attributes and relations.\nTypes.\nDomain ontology.\nA domain ontology (or domain-specific ontology) represents concepts which belong to a realm of the world, such as biology or politics. Each domain ontology typically models domain-specific definitions of terms. For example, the word \"card\" has many different meanings. An ontology about the domain of poker would model the \"playing card\" meaning of the word, while an ontology about the domain of computer hardware would model the \"punched card\" and \"video card\" meanings.\nSince domain ontologies are written by different people, they represent concepts in very specific and unique ways, and are often incompatible within the same project. As systems that rely on domain ontologies expand, they often need to merge domain ontologies by hand-tuning each entity or using a combination of software merging and hand-tuning. This presents a challenge to the ontology designer. Different ontologies in the same domain arise due to different languages, different intended usage of the ontologies, and different perceptions of the domain (based on cultural background, education, ideology, etc.).\nAt present, merging ontologies that are not developed from a common upper ontology is a largely manual process and therefore time-consuming and expensive. Domain ontologies that use the same upper ontology to provide a set of basic elements with which to specify the meanings of the domain ontology entities can be merged with less effort. There are studies on generalized techniques for merging ontologies, but this area of research is still ongoing, and it is a recent event to see the issue sidestepped by having multiple domain ontologies using the same upper ontology like the OBO Foundry.\nUpper ontology.\nAn upper ontology (or foundation ontology) is a model of the commonly shared relations and objects that are generally applicable across a wide range of domain ontologies. It usually employs a core glossary that overarches the terms and associated object descriptions as they are used in various relevant domain ontologies.\nStandardized upper ontologies available for use include BFO, Dublin Core, GFO, Cyc, SUMO, UMBEL, and DOLCE. WordNet has been considered an upper ontology by some and has been used as a linguistic tool for learning domain ontologies.\nHybrid ontology.\nThe Gellish ontology is an example of a combination of an upper and a domain ontology.\nVisualization.\nA survey of ontology visualization methods is presented by Katifori et al. An updated survey of ontology visualization methods and tools was published by Dud\u00e1s et al. The most established ontology visualization methods, namely indented tree and graph visualization are evaluated by Fu et al. A visual language for ontologies represented in OWL is specified by the \"Visual Notation for OWL Ontologies (VOWL)\".\nEngineering.\nOntology engineering (also called ontology building) is a set of tasks related to the development of ontologies for a particular domain. It is a subfield of knowledge engineering that studies the ontology development process, the ontology life cycle, the methods and methodologies for building ontologies, and the tools and languages that support them.\nOntology engineering aims to make explicit the knowledge contained in software applications, and organizational procedures for a particular domain. Ontology engineering offers a direction for overcoming semantic obstacles, such as those related to the definitions of business terms and software classes. Known challenges with ontology engineering include:\nEditors.\nOntology editors are applications designed to assist in the creation or manipulation of ontologies. It is common for ontology editors to use one or more ontology languages.\nAspects of ontology editors include: visual navigation possibilities within the knowledge model, inference engines and information extraction; support for modules; the import and export of foreign knowledge representation languages for ontology matching; and the support of meta-ontologies such as OWL-S, Dublin Core, etc.\nLearning.\nOntology learning is the automatic or semi-automatic creation of ontologies, including extracting a domain's terms from natural language text. As building ontologies manually is extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming, there is great motivation to automate the process. Information extraction and text mining have been explored to automatically link ontologies to documents, for example in the context of the BioCreative challenges.\nResearch.\nEpistemological assumptions, which in research asks \"What do you know? or \"How do you know it?\", creates the foundation researchers use when approaching a certain topic or area for potential research. As epistemology is directly linked to knowledge and how we come about accepting certain truths, individuals conducting academic research must understand what allows them to begin theory building. Simply, epistemological assumptions force researchers to question how they arrive at the knowledge they have.\nLanguages.\nAn ontology language is a formal language used to encode an ontology. There are a number of such languages for ontologies, both proprietary and standards-based:\nPublished examples.\nThe W3C Linking Open Data community project coordinates attempts to converge different ontologies into worldwide Semantic Web.\nLibraries.\nThe development of ontologies has led to the emergence of services providing lists or directories of ontologies called ontology libraries.\nThe following are libraries of human-selected ontologies.\nThe following are both directories and search engines.\nExamples of applications.\nIn general, ontologies can be used beneficially in several fields.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The fuselages and wings were manufactured at Syston under the works manager by the name of Sharp. Sheet metalwork was done at the old 'en tout cas' works at Thurmaston. Final assembly, fitting out and testing took place at Rearsby aerodrome. The name changed to Auster (after the Roman name for the south wind) on 7 March 1946, when production shifted to Rearsby aerodrome, all in Leicestershire. All designs were evolved from the early Taylorcraft with a sprung skid or tailwheel beneath the fin (except for a low-wing aircraft called the \"Agricola\" designed for aerial farming work; only nine of these were completed). When the company was merged into Beagle Aircraft in June, 1961, the high-wing design was developed still further as the Terrier and, with a nosewheel, the Airedale.\nThe Auster name was dropped in 1962 after Beagle Aircraft was created.\nSee also.\nRelated development\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "49690", "revid": "11096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49690", "title": "Handicraft", "text": "Item production made completely by hand or with simple tools\nA handicraft is a traditional main sector of craft making and applies to a wide range of creative and design activities that are related to making things with one's hands and skill, including work with textiles, moldable and rigid materials, paper, plant fibers, clay, etc. One of the oldest handicraft is Dhokra; this is a sort of metal casting that has been used in India for over 5,000 years and is still used. In Iranian Baluchistan, women still make red ware hand-made pottery with dotted ornaments, much similar to the 4,000-year-old pottery tradition of Kalpurgan, an archaeological site near the village. Usually, the term is applied to traditional techniques of creating items (whether for personal use or as products) that are both practical and aesthetic. Handicraft industries are those that produce things with hands to meet the needs of the people in their locality without using machines.\nCollective terms for handicrafts include artisanry, crafting, and handcrafting. The term arts and crafts is also applied, especially in the United States and mostly to hobbyists' and children's output rather than items crafted for daily use, but this distinction is not formal, and the term is easily confused with the Arts and Crafts design movement, which is in fact as practical as it is aesthetic.\nHandicraft has its roots in the rural crafts\u2014the material-goods necessities\u2014of ancient civilizations, and many specific crafts have been practiced for centuries, while others are modern inventions or popularizations of crafts which were originally practiced in a limited geographic area.\nMany handcrafters use natural, even entirely indigenous, materials while others may prefer modern, non-traditional materials, and even upcycle industrial materials. The individual artisanship of a handcrafted item is the paramount criterion; those made by mass production or machines are not handicraft goods.\nSeen as developing the skills and creative interests of students, generally and sometimes towards a particular craft or trade, handicrafts are often integrated into educational systems, both informally and formally. Most crafts require the development of skill and the application of patience but can be learned by virtually anyone.\nLike folk art, handicraft output often has cultural and/or religious significance, and increasingly may have a political message as well, as in craftivism. Many crafts become very popular for brief periods of time (a few months, or a few years), spreading rapidly among the crafting population as everyone emulates the first examples, then their popularity wanes until a later resurgence.\nThe Arts and Crafts movement in the West.\nThe Arts and Crafts movement originated as a late-19th-century design reform and social movement principally in Europe, North America and Australia, and continues today. Its proponents are motivated by the ideals of movement founders, such as William Morris and John Ruskin, who proposed that in pre-industrial societies, such as the European Middle Ages, people had achieved fulfillment through the creative process of handicrafts. This was held up in contrast to what was perceived to be the alienating effects of industrial labor.\nThese activities were called \"crafts\" because originally many of them were professions under the craft guild system. Adolescents were apprenticed to a master craftsman and refined their skills over a period of years in exchange for low wages. By the time their training was complete, they were well equipped to set up in trade for themselves, earning their living with the skill that could be traded directly within the community, often for goods and services. The Industrial Revolution and the increasing mechanization of production processes gradually reduced or eliminated many of the roles professional craftspeople played, and today many handicrafts are increasingly seen, especially when no longer the mainstay of a formal vocational trade, as a form of hobby, folk art and sometimes fine art.\nThe term \"handicrafts\" can also refer to the products themselves of such artisanal efforts, that require specialized knowledge, maybe highly technical in their execution, require specialized equipment and/or facilities to produce, involve manual labor or a blue-collar work ethic, are accessible to the general public, and are constructed from materials with histories that exceed the boundaries of Western \"fine art\" tradition, such as ceramics, glass, textiles, metal and wood. These products are produced within a specific community of practice, and while they mostly differ from the products produced within the communities of art and design, the boundaries often overlap, resulting in hybrid objects. Additionally, as the interpretation and validation of art is frequently a matter of context, an audience may perceive handcrafted objects as art objects when these objects are viewed within an art context, such as in a museum or in a position of prominence in one's home.\nIn modern education.\nSimple \"arts and crafts\" projects are a common elementary and middle school activity in both mainstream and alternative education systems around the world.\nIn some of the Scandinavian or Nordic countries, more advanced handicrafts form part of the formal, compulsory school curriculum, and are collectively referred to as \"sl\u00f6jd\" in Swedish, and \"k\u00e4sity\u00f6\" in Finnish. Students learn how to work mainly with metal, textile and wood, not for professional training purposes as in American vocational\u2013technical schools, but with the aim to develop children's and teens' practical skills, such as everyday problem-solving ability, tool use, and understanding of the materials that surround us for economical, cultural and environmental purposes.\nSecondary schools and college and university art departments increasingly provide elective options for more handicraft-based arts, in addition to formal \"fine arts\", a distinction that continues to fade throughout the years, especially with the rise of studio craft, i.e. the use of traditional handicrafts techniques by professional fine artists.\nMany community centers and schools run evening or day classes and workshops, for adults and children, offering to teach basic craft skills in a short period of time.\nHandicraft production.\nHandicraft production is a small\u2013scale production of products using manual labor. It was especially common in the Middle Ages, during the era of the Industrial Revolution it was mainly supplanted by mass production, however, it still exists for the production of goods such as luxury goods. The \"handmade effect\" is a phenomenon where consumers exhibit a preference for products that are crafted by human labor rather than produced through automated or robotic processes. This preference is particularly pronounced for products with higher symbolic value, where expressing one's beliefs and personality holds greater significance. Consumers, especially in contexts emphasizing symbolic consumption, have a stronger motivation for uniqueness and associate human labor more closely with product uniqueness. In product categories where mechanical production is common, consumers are more attracted to products labeled as handmade. The positive handmade effect on product attractiveness is driven, in large part, by the perception that handmade products symbolically \"contain love.\" The handmade effect is influenced by two key factors. Firstly, consumers express stronger intentions to purchase handmade products when buying gifts for loved ones, compared to more distant recipients. Secondly, they are willing to pay a higher price for handmade gifts when the purchase is motivated by the desire to convey love rather than simply acquiring the best-performing product.\nThe handicraft method of production has been used by people since ancient times. Initially, people engaged in handicraft production aimed to satisfy the needs of their own economy, however, with the development of commodity\u2013money relations, an increasing number of goods produced by them began to be supplied to the market. Mostly these were household products: dishes, furniture, jewelry, souvenirs, clothes, shoes. However, over time, other goods, such as weapons, began to go on sale.\nIn pre\u2013revolutionary Russia, handicraft production was quite widespread: about 30% of all manufactured products were produced by handicraft methods. Products were sold at fairs, and barter exchange was widespread. With the beginning of industrialisation and collectivization of the Soviet Union, the handicraft mode of production was declared \"the highest degree of oppression of the working people\" and ceased to exist in almost all spheres of the Soviet economy except on an informal basis.\nSome state economies, such as that of Vietnam, are largely based on handicraft production. For example, in the 1950s in North Vietnam, there were more than 100,000 handicraft enterprises. In the early 1970s, even before the end of the war, handicraft production provided about half of all the products of the local industry and almost a third of the total industrial production of the republic. By 1977, after the reunification of Vietnam, there were 700,000 handicraftsmen in South Vietnam.\nHandicraft production in Nepal withstands competition with industrial production and foreign goods, which is explained not only by economic and natural\u2013geographical factors, but also by the support and encouragement of the handicraft industry from the state.\nList of common handicrafts.\nThere are almost as many variations on the theme of handicrafts as there are crafters with time on their hands, but they can be broken down into a number of categories:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSales venues.\nHandicrafts are often made for home use and decor. If sold, they are sold in direct sales, gift shops, public markets, and online shopping. In developing countries, handicrafts are sold to locals and as souvenirs to tourists. Sellers tend to speak at least a few words of common tourist languages. There are also specialty markets such as:\nAsian handicrafts.\nAccording to the Vietnam Handicrafts Export Association (VIETCRAFT), Vietnam's handicrafts export turnover in 2023 reached US$2.2 billion, up 10.5% over 2022. The United States is Vietnam's largest export market, accounting for 35% of total export turnover. Vietnam's handicrafts industry currently has about 600 villages, with over 10 million direct workers.\nWickerwork is a traditional handicraft industry, based on the use of two basic materials, bamboo and rattan. Vietnam currently has 893 villages specializing in wickerwork, accounting for 24% of the total number of villages, including 647 bamboo and rattan villages and 246 straw and water hyacinth villages.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1949, it began maintaining aircraft used by some of Britain's contemporary independent airlines on the Berlin Airlift. In the early 1950s, it branched out into aircraft conversions and manufacturing. During that period it also became a subcontractor for other aircraft manufacturers. By the end of the decade, it was taken over by the Airwork group.\nHistory.\nAviation Traders Ltd. (ATL) was established by Freddie Laker at Bovingdon in Hertfordshire, England, in 1947 to trade in war-surplus aircraft and spares. Two years later, Laker shifted his fledgling business to new premises at Rochford aerodrome (later Southend Municipal Airport) near Southend-on-Sea, Essex, England.\nATL initially specialised in converting numerous war-surplus bombers and transporters into freighters. This included the conversion of Handley Page Halifax bombers into freighters, six of which were sold to Bond Air Services, an early post-war independent British airline. Bond Air Services based these planes at Wunstorf aerodrome in West Germany to carry essential supplies into West Berlin during the Berlin Blockade of 1948\u201349. Bond Air Services furthermore contracted Aviation Traders to service these planes. In return, Aviation Traders got half of Bond Air Services' freight charges. Following the end of the Berlin Airlift in 1949, Laker had most of the Halifaxes he had supplied to various independent airlines during the Airlift scrapped at its Southend facilities.\nAviation Traders (Engineering) Ltd \u2013 (ATEL), ATL's engineering division, was formally established in 1949. Laker put Jack Wiseman, a fully qualified aircraft maintenance engineer with whom he had worked for a brief period at London Aero Motor Services (LASM), in charge of his new engineering business.\nThree former British European Airways (BEA) Vickers Vikings, which Laker had acquired in 1949 as well, were overhauled at ATL's Southend maintenance base and sold on to British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) at a profit.\nThe following year, ATL's engineering arm cannibalised a number of unairworthy Yorks and Lancasters Laker had purchased to rebuild the salvaged parts into three airworthy Yorks.\nATL also became one of many post-war aircraft manufacturers which attempted to develop a successor to the ubiquitous Douglas DC-3 piston-engine airliner.\nATL's answer was the 28 passenger ATL-90 Accountant powered by two Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engines, which first flew on 9 July 1957, however ATL's design was competing against a large number of designs from well-established aircraft manufacturers with much deeper pockets and could not match the scale of their investments, either in the design and development or in marketing it. Competing designs including the Convair CV-240 series, Fokker F-27 Friendship and Vickers VC.1 Viking also saturated the market. As a consequence, the Accountant failed to attract orders, which led to the programme's termination and in the prototype's destruction.\nSubsequent conversion work was more successful. Avro Tudor airliners were fitted with large side freight doors for Air Charter Ltd (one of ATL's sister companies) as \"Supertraders\".\nTwenty-one Douglas DC-4 airliners were converted into car ferries as the ATL-98 Carvair, a major rebuild that replaced the aircraft's original nose with an enlarged version that raised the cockpit above the cargo hold and added a hinged nose through which five cars could be loaded with a mobile scissor lift. Twenty-five passengers could be carried in the unaltered rear fuselage while the fin was enlarged to offset the increased side area of the new forward fuselage. Carvairs were operated from Southend Airport on short air ferry routes across the English Channel or North Sea where they supplemented Bristol Freighters already being used in the same role. High speed car ferry service by large hovercraft such as the SR.N4 meant an end to the service.\nATL installed unused Rolls-Royce Merlins in ex-BOAC \"Canadair Argonaut (North Star)\" airliners. The engines were acquired earlier along with ex-BOAC Halifaxes and several Avro Tudors purchased from the British Government.\nIn 1951, ATL won a contract from Bristol Aircraft to manufacture wing centre sections for Bristol Freighters. Between the beginning of 1952 and the end of 1955, ATL built 50 wing sections for Bristol Aircraft. During that period ATL had grown into a large engineering and manufacturing organisation.\nIn 1956, ATL purchased over 250 surplus ex-Royal Air Force Percival Prentice trainers, about 20 of which were converted for civilian customers.\nIn 1958, Laker announced his decision to sell both ATL and Air Charter to Airwork for \u00a3600,000 cash plus a further \u00a3200,000, subject to the valuation of stock. The deal became effective in January 1959, when both companies joined the Airwork group.\nIn 1996, Britavia, which was part of Airwork and was the design arm of Shorts Support Services ceased trading as Britavia and was subject to a Management Buy-Out, and started trading again as Aviation Traders Limited (ATL) based at Bournemouth Airport until 2016. In 2016 ATL moved to their current offices in Wimborne. ATL provided approved design services under the CAA reference of DAI/9525/96. With the introduction of EASA, ATL moved under the control of EASA and transferred to a Design Organisation Approval (DOA) under Part 21J and now certifies and designs fixed and rotary wing modifications under approval reference EASA.21J.016. ATL are currently opening a European company and office to continue following BREXIT.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

When no direction is specified, gain is understood to refer to the peak value of the gain, the gain in the direction of the antenna's main lobe. A plot of the gain as a function of direction is called the antenna pattern or radiation pattern. It is not to be confused with directivity, which does \"not\" take an antenna's radiation efficiency into account.\nGain or 'absolute gain' is defined as \"The ratio of the radiation intensity in a given direction to the radiation intensity that would be produced if the power accepted by the antenna were isotropically radiated\". Usually this ratio is expressed in decibels with respect to an isotropic radiator (dBi). An alternative definition compares the received power to the power received by a lossless half-wave dipole antenna, in which case the units are written as \"dBd\". Since a lossless dipole antenna has a gain of 2.15\u00a0dBi, the relation between these units is formula_1. For a given frequency, the antenna's effective area is proportional to the gain. An antenna's effective length is proportional to the \"square root\" of the antenna's gain for a particular frequency and radiation resistance. Due to reciprocity, the gain of any antenna when receiving is equal to its gain when transmitting.\nGain.\nGain is a unitless measure that multiplies an antenna's radiation efficiency \"formula_2\" and directivity \"D\":\nformula_3\nRadiation efficiency.\nThe radiation efficiency formula_2 of an antenna is \"The ratio of the total power radiated by an antenna to the net power accepted by the antenna from the connected transmitter.\"\nformula_5\nA transmitting antenna is supplied with power by a transmission line connecting the antenna to a radio transmitter. The power accepted by the antenna formula_6 is the power supplied to the antenna's terminals. Losses prior to the antenna terminals are accounted for by separate impedance mismatch factors which are therefore not included in the calculation of radiation efficiency.\nGain in decibels.\nPublished numbers for antenna gain are almost always expressed in decibels (dB), a logarithmic scale. From the gain factor G, one finds the gain in decibels as:\nformula_7\nTherefore, an antenna with a peak power gain of 5 would be said to have a gain of 7\u00a0dBi. dBi is used rather than just dB to emphasize that this is the gain according to the basic definition, in which the antenna is compared to an isotropic radiator.\nWhen actual measurements of an antenna's gain are made by a laboratory, the field strength of the test antenna is measured when supplied with, say, 1 watt of transmitter power, at a certain distance. That field strength is compared to the field strength found using a so-called \"reference antenna\" at the same distance receiving the same power in order to determine the gain of the antenna under test. That ratio would be equal to \"G\" if the reference antenna were an isotropic radiator (irad).\nHowever a true isotropic radiator cannot be built, so in practice a different antenna is used. This will often be a half-wave dipole, a very well understood and repeatable antenna that can be easily built for any frequency. The directive gain of a half-wave dipole with respect to the isotropic radiator is known to be 1.64 and it can be made nearly 100% efficient. Since the gain has been measured with respect to this reference antenna, the difference in the gain of the test antenna is often compared to that of the dipole. The gain relative to a dipole is thus often quoted and is denoted using dBd instead of dBi to avoid confusion. Therefore, in terms of the true gain (relative to an isotropic radiator) \"G\", this figure for the gain is given by:\nformula_8\nFor instance, the above antenna with a gain \"G\" = 5 would have a gain with respect to a dipole of 5/1.64 \u2248 3.05, or in decibels one would call this 10\u00a0log(3.05) \u2248 4.84\u00a0dBd. In general:\nformula_9\nBoth dBi and dBd are in common use. When an antenna's maximum gain is specified in decibels (for instance, by a manufacturer) one must be certain as to whether this means the gain relative to an isotropic radiator or with respect to a dipole. If it specifies dBi or dBd then there is no ambiguity, but if only dB is specified then the fine print must be consulted. Either figure can be easily converted into the other using the above relationship.\nWhen considering an antenna's directional pattern, gain with respect to a dipole does \"not\" imply a comparison of that antenna's gain in each direction to a dipole's gain in that direction. Rather, it is a comparison between the antenna's gain in each direction to the \"peak\" gain of the dipole (1.64). In any direction, therefore, such numbers are 2.15\u00a0dB smaller than the gain expressed in dBi.\nPartial gain.\nPartial gain is calculated as power gain, but for a particular polarization. It is defined as the part of the radiation intensity formula_10 corresponding to a given polarization, divided by the total radiation intensity of an isotropic antenna.\nThe partial gains in the formula_11 and formula_12 components are expressed as\nformula_13\nand\nformula_14,\nwhere formula_15 and formula_16 represent the radiation intensity in a given direction contained in their respective formula_17 field component.\nAs a result of this definition, we can conclude that the total gain of an antenna is the sum of partial gains for any two orthogonal polarizations.\nformula_18\nExamples.\nFirst example.\nSuppose a lossless antenna has a radiation pattern given by:\nformula_19\nLet us find the gain of such an antenna. First we find the peak radiation intensity of this antenna:\nformula_20\nThe total radiated power can be found by integrating over all directions:\nformula_21\nSince the antenna is specified as being lossless the radiation efficiency is 1. The maximum gain is then equal to:\nformula_22\nExpressed relative to the gain of a half-wave dipole we would find:\nformula_23.\nSecond example.\nAs an example, consider an antenna that radiates an electromagnetic wave whose electrical field has an amplitude formula_24 at a distance formula_25 That amplitude is given by:\n formula_26\nwhere:\nFor a large distance formula_25 The radiated wave can be considered locally as a plane wave. The intensity of an electromagnetic plane wave is:\n formula_30\nwhere \n formula_31 is a universal constant called vacuum impedance.\nand\n formula_32\nIf the resistive part of the series impedance of the antenna is formula_33 the power fed to the antenna is formula_34 The intensity of an isotropic antenna is the power so fed divided by the surface of the sphere of radius r:\n formula_35\n (In most cases 73.130, is adequate)\nformula_36\n (Likewise, 1.64 and 2.15 dBi are usually the cited values)\nSometimes, the half-wave dipole is taken as a reference instead of the isotropic radiator. The gain is then given in dBd (decibels over dipole):\n 0 dBd = 2.15 dBi\nRealized gain.\nRealized gain differs from gain in that it is \"reduced by its impedance mismatch factor.\" This mismatch induces losses above the dissipative losses described above; therefore, realized gain will always be less than gain. Gain may be expressed as absolute gain if further clarification is required to differentiate it from realized gain.\nTotal radiated power.\nTotal radiated power (TRP) is the sum of all RF power radiated by the antenna when the source power is included in the measurement. TRP is expressed in watts or the corresponding logarithmic expressions, often dBm or dBW.\nWhen testing mobile devices, TRP can be measured while in close proximity of power-absorbing losses such as the body and hand of the user.\nThe TRP can be used to determine body loss (BoL). The body loss is considered as the ratio of TRP measured in the presence of losses and TRP measured while in free space.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

Well-known and important concepts such as the Legendre polynomials and Legendre transformation are named after him. He is also known for his contributions to the method of least squares, and was the first to officially publish on it, though Carl Friedrich Gauss had discovered it before him.\nLife.\nAdrien-Marie Legendre was born in Paris on 18 September 1752 to a wealthy family. He received his education at the Coll\u00e8ge Mazarin in Paris, and defended his thesis in physics and mathematics in 1770. He taught at the \u00c9cole Militaire in Paris from 1775 to 1780 and at the \u00c9cole Normale from 1795. At the same time, he was associated with the Bureau des Longitudes. In 1782, the Berlin Academy awarded Legendre a prize for his treatise on projectiles in resistant media. This treatise also brought him to the attention of Lagrange.\nThe \"Acad\u00e9mie des sciences\" made Legendre an adjoint member in 1783 and an associate in 1785. In 1789, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.\nHe assisted with the Anglo-French Survey (1784\u20131790) to calculate the precise distance between the Paris Observatory and the Royal Greenwich Observatory by means of trigonometry. To this end in 1787 he visited Dover and London together with Dominique, comte de Cassini and Pierre M\u00e9chain. The three also visited William Herschel, the discoverer of the planet Uranus.\nLegendre lost his private fortune in 1793 during the French Revolution. That year, he also married Marguerite-Claudine Couhin, who helped him put his affairs in order. In 1795, Legendre became one of six members of the mathematics section of the reconstituted Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, renamed the Institut National des Sciences et des Arts. Later, in 1803, Napoleon reorganized the Institut National, and Legendre became a member of the Geometry section. From 1799 to 1812, Legendre served as mathematics examiner for graduating artillery students at the \u00c9cole Militaire and from 1799 to 1815 he served as permanent mathematics examiner for the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. In 1824, Legendre's pension from the \u00c9cole Militaire was stopped because he refused to vote for the government candidate at the Institut National. In 1831, he was made an officer of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur.\nLegendre died in Paris on 9 January 1833, after a long and painful illness, and Legendre's widow carefully preserved his belongings to memorialize him. Upon her death in 1856, she was buried next to her husband in the village of Auteuil, where the couple had lived, and left their last country house to the village. Legendre's name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.\nMathematical work.\nAbel's work on elliptic functions was built on Legendre's, and some of Gauss's work in statistics and number theory completed that of Legendre. He developed, and first communicated to his contemporaries before Gauss, the least squares method which has broad application in linear regression, signal processing, statistics, and curve fitting; this was published in 1806 as an appendix to his book on the paths of comets. Today, the term \"least squares method\" is used as a direct translation from the French \"m\u00e9thode des moindres carr\u00e9s\".\nHis major work is \"Exercices de Calcul Int\u00e9gral\", published in three volumes in 1811, 1817 and 1819. In the first volume he introduced the basic properties of elliptic integrals, beta functions and gamma functions, introducing the symbol \u0393 and normalizing it to \u0393(n+1) = n!. Further results on the beta and gamma functions along with their applications to mechanics \u2013 such as the rotation of the earth, and the attraction of ellipsoids \u2013 appeared in the second volume. In 1830, he gave a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for exponent \"n\"\u00a0=\u00a05, which was also proven by Lejeune Dirichlet in 1828.\nIn number theory, he conjectured the quadratic reciprocity law, subsequently proved by Gauss; in connection to this, the Legendre symbol is named after him. He also did pioneering work on the distribution of primes, and on the application of analysis to number theory. His 1798 conjecture of the prime number theorem was rigorously proved by Hadamard and de la Vall\u00e9e-Poussin in 1896.\nLegendre did an impressive amount of work on elliptic functions, including the classification of elliptic integrals, but it took Abel's study of the inverses of Jacobi's functions to solve the problem completely.\nHe is known for the Legendre transformation, which is used to go from the Lagrangian to the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics. In thermodynamics it is also used to obtain the enthalpy and the Helmholtz and Gibbs (free) energies from the internal energy. He is also the namesake of the Legendre polynomials, solutions to Legendre's differential equation, which occur frequently in physics and engineering applications, such as electrostatics.\nLegendre is best known as the author of \"\u00c9l\u00e9ments de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie\", which was published in 1794 and was the leading elementary text on the topic for around 100 years. This text greatly rearranged and simplified many of the propositions from Euclid's \"Elements\" to create a more effective textbook.\nMistaken portrait.\nFor two centuries, until the recent discovery of the error in 2005, books, paintings and articles have incorrectly shown a profile portrait of the obscure French politician Louis Legendre (1752\u20131797) as a portrait of the mathematician. The error arose from the fact that the sketch was labelled simply \"Legendre\" and appeared in a book along with contemporary mathematicians such as Lagrange. One of only two known portraits of Legendre, rediscovered in 2008, is found in the 1820 book \"Album de 73 portraits-charge aquarell\u00e9s des membres de I'Institut\", a book of caricatures of seventy-three members of the Institut de France in Paris by the French artist Julien-L\u00e9opold Boilly as shown below. The other portrait is from the book \"Le Panth\u00e9on scientifique de la tour Eiffel\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It stars Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich, Alfred Abel, Rudolf Klein-Rogge, and Brigitte Helm. Erich Pommer produced it in the Babelsberg Studio for Universum Film A.G. (UFA). \"Metropolis\" is regarded as a pioneering science-fiction film, being among the first feature-length ones of that genre. Filming took place over 17 months in 1925\u201326 at a cost of more than five million Reichsmarks, or the equivalent of about \u20ac million.\nMade in Germany during the Weimar period, \"Metropolis\" is set in a futuristic urban dystopia and follows the attempts of Freder, the wealthy son of the city master, and Maria, a saintly figure to the workers, to overcome the vast gulf separating the classes in their city and bring the workers together with Joh Fredersen, the city master. The film's message is encompassed in the final inter-title: \"The Mediator Between the Head and the Hands Must Be the Heart\".\n\"Metropolis\" met a mixed reception upon release. Critics found it visually beautiful and powerful \u2013 the film's art direction by Otto Hunte, Erich Kettelhut, and Karl Vollbrecht draws influence from opera, Bauhaus, Cubist, and Futurist design, along with touches of the Gothic in the scenes in the catacombs, the cathedral and Rotwang's house \u2013 and lauded its complex special effects, but accused its story of being na\u00efve. H. G. Wells described the film as \"silly\", and \"The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\" calls the story \"trite\" and its politics \"ludicrously simplistic\". Its alleged communist message was also criticized.\nThe film's long running time also came in for criticism. It was cut substantially after its German premiere. Many attempts have been made since the 1970s to restore the film. In 1984, Italian music producer Giorgio Moroder released a truncated version with a soundtrack by rock artists including Freddie Mercury, Loverboy, and Adam Ant. In 2001, a new reconstruction of \"Metropolis\" was shown at the Berlin Film Festival. In 2008, a damaged print of Lang's original cut of the film was found in a museum in Argentina. Footage from both this print and a second one archived in New Zealand was restored and re-integrated into the film, bringing it to within five minutes of its original running time. This version was shown on large screens in Berlin and Frankfurt simultaneously on 12 February 2010.\n\"Metropolis\" is now widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, ranking 67th in \"Sight and Sound\"'s 2022 critics' poll, and receiving general critical acclaim. In 2001, the film was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World International Register, the first film thus distinguished. \nOn 1 January 2023, the film's American reserved copyright expired, thereby entering the film into the public domain.\nPlot.\nIn the future, wealthy industrialists and business magnates and their top employees reign over the city of Metropolis from colossal skyscrapers, while underground-dwelling workers toil to operate the great machines that power it. Joh Fredersen is the city's master. His son, Freder, idles away his time at sports and in a pleasure garden, but is interrupted by the arrival of a young woman named Maria, who has brought a group of workers' children to witness the lifestyle of their rich \"brothers\".\nMaria and the children are ushered away, but Freder becomes fascinated by her. Against the strict rules of the city, he enters the lower levels to search for her. In the machine halls, he witnesses the explosion of a huge machine that kills and injures numerous workers. Freder has a hallucination that the machine is a temple of Moloch and the workers are being fed to it. When the hallucination ends, and he sees the dead workers being carried away on stretchers, he hurries to tell his father about the accident.\nGrot, foreman of the Heart Machine, brings Fredersen two maps found in the dead workers' pockets. Fredersen fires his assistant Josaphat for not being the first to bring him details about the explosion or the maps. After seeing his father's cold indifference towards the harsh conditions faced by the workers, Freder secretly rebels by deciding to help them. He enlists Josaphat's assistance and returns to the machine halls, taking the place of a worker who has collapsed from exhaustion.\nFredersen takes the maps to the city's greatest inventor, Rotwang, to learn their meaning. Rotwang had been in love with a woman named Hel, who left him to marry Fredersen and later died giving birth to Freder. Rotwang shows Fredersen a robot he has built to \"resurrect\" Hel. The maps show a network of catacombs beneath Metropolis, and the two men go to investigate. They eavesdrop on a gathering of workers, including Freder. Maria addresses them, prophesying the arrival of a mediator who can bring the working and ruling classes together. Freder believes he can fill the role and declares his love for Maria.\nFredersen orders Rotwang to give Maria's likeness to the robot so that it can discredit her among the workers, but is unaware of Rotwang's true plan to destroy Metropolis and kill Freder. Rotwang kidnaps Maria, fashions the robot in her image, and presents her to Fredersen. Freder finds the two embracing and, believing his father to have betrayed him, falls into a prolonged delirium. Intercut with his hallucinations, the false Maria preaches to the workers that they must rise up against the surface world, resulting in chaos and dissent.\nFreder recovers and returns to the catacombs, accompanied by Josaphat. Finding the false Maria urging the workers to destroy the machines, he accuses her of not being the real Maria. The workers ignore him and carry out her wishes, smashing the machines and triggering a great flood in their underground city that threatens to drown their children. The real Maria, having escaped from Rotwang's house, rescues the children with help from Freder and Josaphat. Grot berates the celebrating workers for abandoning their children in the flood. The workers become hysterical and condemn the false Maria, burning her at the stake. A horrified Freder watches until the fire reveals her to be a robot. Rotwang, now suffering from a delusion that Maria is Hel, chases her to the roof of the cathedral, pursued by Freder. The two men fight as Fredersen and the workers watch from the street, and Rotwang falls to his death. Freder fulfills his destiny to unite the two halves of Metropolis' society by linking the hands of Fredersen and Grot to bring them together.\nInfluences.\n\"Metropolis\" features a range of elaborate special effects and set designs, ranging from a huge gothic cathedral to a futuristic cityscape. In an interview, Fritz Lang reported that \"the film was born from my first sight of the skyscrapers in New York in October 1924\". He had visited New York City for the first time and remarked \"I looked into the streets\u2014the glaring lights and the tall buildings\u2014and there I conceived \"Metropolis\",\" although in actuality Lang and Harbou had been at work on the idea for over a year. Describing his first impressions of the city, Lang said that \"the buildings seemed to be a vertical sail, scintillating and very light, a luxurious backdrop, suspended in the dark sky to dazzle, distract and hypnotize\". He added \"The sight of Neuyork [sic] alone should be enough to turn this beacon of beauty into the center of a film...\"\nThe appearance of the city in \"Metropolis\" is strongly informed by the Art Deco movement; however, it also incorporates elements from other traditions. Ingeborg Hoesterey described the architecture featured in \"Metropolis\" as eclectic, writing how its locales represent both \"functionalist modernism [and] art deco\" whilst also featuring \"the scientist's archaic little house with its high-powered laboratory, the catacombs [and] the Gothic cathedral\". The film's use of art deco architecture was highly influential, and has been reported to have contributed to the style's subsequent popularity in Europe and America. The New Babel Tower, for instance, has been inspired by Upper Silesian Tower in Pozna\u0144 fairgrounds, which was recognized in Germany as a masterpiece of architecture.\nLang's visit to several Hollywood studios in the same 1924 trip also influenced the film in another way: Lang and producer Erich Pommer realized that to compete with the vertical integration of Hollywood, their next film would have to be bigger, broader, and better made than anything they had made before. Despite UFA's growing debt, Lang announced that \"Metropolis\" would be \"the costliest and most ambitious picture ever.\"\nThe film drew heavily on biblical sources for several of its key set-pieces. During her first talk to the workers, Maria uses the story of the Tower of Babel to highlight the discord between the intellectuals and the workers. Additionally, a delusional Freder imagines the false-Maria as the Whore of Babylon, riding on the back of a many-headed dragon.\nThe name of the Yoshiwara club alludes to the famous red-light district of Tokyo.\nMuch of the plot line of \"Metropolis\" stems from the First World War and the culture of the Weimar Republic in Germany. Lang explores the themes of industrialization and mass production in his film; two developments that played a large role in the war. Other post-World War I themes that Lang includes in \"Metropolis\" include the Weimar view of American modernity, fascism, and communism.\nProduction.\nPre-production.\n\"Metropolis\"'s screenplay was written by Thea von Harbou, a popular writer in Weimar Germany, jointly with Lang, her then-husband. The film's plot originated from a novel of the same title written by Harbou for the sole purpose of being made into a film. The novel in turn drew inspiration from H. G. Wells, Mary Shelley and Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's works and other German dramas. The novel featured strongly in the film's marketing campaign, and was serialized in the journal \"Illustriertes Blatt\" in the run-up to its release. Harbou and Lang collaborated on the screenplay derived from the novel, and several plot points and thematic elements\u2014including most of the references to magic and occultism present in the novel\u2014were dropped.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe screenplay itself went through many rewrites, and at one point featured an ending where Freder flew to the stars; this plot element later became the basis for Lang's \"Woman in the Moon\". The time setting of \"Metropolis\" is open to interpretation. The 2010 re-release and reconstruction, which incorporated the original title cards written by Thea von Harbou, do not specify a year. Before the reconstruction, Lotte Eisner and Paul M. Jensen placed the events happening around the year 2000. Giorgio Moroder's re-scored version included a title card placing the film in 2026, while Paramount's original US release said the film takes place in 3000.\nA note in one edition of Harbou's novel says that the story does not take place at any particular place or time, in the past or the future. Meanwhile, the 1963 Ace Books edition, which is a reprint of the 1927 English edition, specifies the setting as \"The World of 2026 A.D.\".\nFilming.\nOn 22 May 1925, \"Metropolis\" began principal photography with an initial budget of 1.5 million\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01. Lang cast two unknowns with little film experience in the lead roles. Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich (Freder) had worked in vaudeville and was originally employed as an extra on \"Metropolis\" before Thea von Harbou recommended him to Lang. Brigitte Helm (Maria) had been given a screen test by Lang after he met her on the set of \"Die Nibelungen\", but would make her feature film debut with \"Metropolis\". In the role of Joh Fredersen, Lang cast Alfred Abel, a noted stage and screen actor whom he had worked with on \"Dr. Mabuse the Gambler\". Lang also cast his frequent collaborator Rudolph Klein-Rogge in the role of Rotwang. This was Klein-Rogge's fourth film with Lang, after \"Destiny\", \"Dr. Mabuse the Gambler\", and \"Die Nibelungen\".\nShooting of the film was a draining experience for the actors involved due to the demands that Lang placed on them. For the scene where the workers' city was flooded, Helm and 500 children from the poorest districts of Berlin had to work for 14 days in a pool of water that Lang intentionally kept at a low temperature. Lang would frequently demand numerous re-takes, and took two days to shoot a simple scene where Freder collapses at Maria's feet; by the time Lang was satisfied with the footage he had shot, actor Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich found he could barely stand. Other anecdotes involve Lang's insistence on using real fire for the climactic scene where the false Maria is burnt at the stake (which resulted in Helm's dress catching fire), and his ordering extras to throw themselves towards powerful jets of water when filming the flooding of the workers' city.\nHelm recalled her experiences of shooting the film in a contemporary interview, saying that \"the night shots lasted three weeks, and even if they did lead to the greatest dramatic moments\u2014even if we did follow Fritz Lang's directions as though in a trance, enthusiastic and enraptured at the same time\u2014I can't forget the incredible strain that they put us under. The work wasn't easy, and the authenticity in the portrayal ended up testing our nerves now and then. For instance, it wasn't fun at all when Grot drags me by the hair, to have me burned at the stake. Once I even fainted: during the transformation scene, Maria, as the android, is clamped in a kind of wooden armament, and because the shot took so long, I didn't get enough air.\"\nDespite the hardships, Thea von Harbou recounted how the film set was paradise for the hundreds of poor, malnourished children used as extras. In 1927 in \"Metropolis Magazine\", von Harbou describes their warm and clean rooms, time for play, and ample toys and hot meals four times a day. \"No film ever had more enthusiastic and willing collaborators than these little children,\" she recalled, \"always willing to dash into the chilly water [...] like perfect actors\".\nUFA invited several trade journal representatives and several film critics to see the film's shooting as parts of its promotion campaign.\nShooting lasted 17 months, with 310 shooting days and 60 shooting nights, and was finally completed on 30 October 1926. By the time shooting finished, the film's budget leapt to 5.3 million Reichsmarks, over three and a half times the original budget. Producer Erich Pommer had been fired during production.\nSpecial effects.\nThe effects expert Eugen Sch\u00fcfftan created pioneering visual effects for \"Metropolis\". Among the effects used are miniatures of the city, a camera on a swing, and most notably, the Sch\u00fcfftan process, in which mirrors are used to create the illusion that actors are occupying miniature sets. This new technique was seen again just two years later in Alfred Hitchcock's film \"Blackmail\" (1929).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe \"Maschinenmensch\" \u2013 the robot built by Rotwang to resurrect his lost love Hel \u2013 was created by sculptor Walter Schulze-Mittendorff. A whole-body plaster cast was taken of actress Brigitte Helm, and the costume was then constructed around it. A chance discovery of a sample of \"plastic wood\" (a pliable substance designed as wood-filler) allowed Schulze-Mittendorff to build a costume that would both appear metallic and allow a small amount of free movement. Helm sustained cuts and bruises while in character as the robot, as the costume was rigid and uncomfortable.\nMusic.\nOriginal score.\nGottfried Huppertz composed the film's score for a large orchestra. He drew inspiration from Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss, and combined a classical orchestral style with mild modernist touches to portray the film's massive industrial city of workers. Nestled within the original score were quotations of Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle's \"La Marseillaise\" and the traditional \"Dies Irae\", the latter of which was matched to the film's apocalyptic imagery. Huppertz's music played a prominent role during the film's production; the composer often played piano on Lang's set to inform the actors' performances. Huppertz's score only accompanied the film once, at its original premiere. Sections of the score were recorded and released by the record label Vox.\nThe full score was not recorded until 2001, for the film's first comprehensive restoration, with Berndt Heller conducting the Rundfunksinfonieorchester Saarbr\u00fccken. It was released internationally on various DVD editions beginning in 2003.\nIn 2007, Huppertz's score was also played live by the VCS Radio Symphony, which accompanied the restored version of the film at Brenden Theatres in Vacaville, California. The score was also produced in a salon orchestration, which was performed for the first time in the United States in August 2007 by the Bijou Orchestra under the direction of Leo Najar as part of a German Expressionist film festival in Bay City, Michigan. The same forces also performed the work at the Traverse City Film Festival in Traverse City, Michigan in August 2009.\nFor the film's 2010 \"complete\" restoration premiere, Huppertz's score was performed live and subsequently re-recorded by the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Frank Strobel. This version was released internationally on various DVD and Blu-ray editions beginning in 2010.\nOther scores.\nVarious artists have created other scores for \"Metropolis\":\nRelease and reception.\n\"Metropolis\" was distributed by Parufamet, a company formed in December 1925 by the American film studios Paramount Pictures and Metro Goldwyn Mayer to loan US$4 million to UFA. The film had its world premiere at the UFA-Palast am Zoo in Berlin on 10 January 1927, where the audience, including a critic from the \"Berliner Morgenpost\", reacted to several of the film's most spectacular scenes with \"spontaneous applause\". However, others have suggested the premiere was met with muted applause interspersed with boos and hisses.\nAt the time of its German premiere, \"Metropolis\" had a length of 4,189 metres, which is approximately 153 minutes at 24 frames per second (fps). UFA's distribution deal with Paramount and MGM \"entitled [them] to make any change [to films produced by UFA] they found appropriate to ensure profitability\". Considering that \"Metropolis\" was too long and unwieldy, Parufamet commissioned American playwright Channing Pollock to write a simpler version of the film that could be assembled using the existing material. Pollock shortened the film dramatically, altered its inter-titles and removed all references to the character of Hel, because the name sounded too similar to the English word Hell, thereby removing Rotwang's original motivation for creating his robot. Pollock said about the original film that it was \"symbolism run such riot that people who saw it couldn't tell what the picture was about. ... I have given it my meaning.\" Lang's response to the re-editing of the film was to say \"I love films, so I shall never go to America. Their experts have slashed my best film, \"Metropolis\", so cruelly that I dare not see it while I am in England.\" The Hel storyline would be partially restored in Giorgio Moroder's 1984 version, and subsequent versions completely restored it.\nIn Pollock's cut, the film ran for 3,170 metres, or approximately 116 minutes\u2014although a contemporary review in \"Variety\" of a showing in New York gave the running time as 107 minutes, and another source lists it at 105 minutes. This version of \"Metropolis\" premiered in the United States in March 1927, and was released, in a slightly different and longer version (128 minutes) in the United Kingdom around the same time with different title cards.\nAlfred Hugenberg, a German nationalist businessman, cancelled UFA's debt to Paramount and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer after taking charge of the company in April 1927, and chose to halt distribution in German cinemas of \"Metropolis\" in its original form. Hugenberg had the film cut down to a length of 3,241 metres (about 118 minutes), broadly along the lines of Pollock's edit, removing the film's perceived \"inappropriate\" communist subtext and religious imagery. Hugenberg's cut of the film was released in German cinemas in August 1927. Later, after demands for more cuts by Nazi censors, UFA distributed a still shorter version of the film (2,530 metres, 91 minutes) in 1936, and an English version of this cut was archived in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) film library in the 1930s. It was this version which was the basis of all versions of \"Metropolis\" until the later restorations. In 1986 it was recopied and returned to Germany to be the basis of the 1987 Munich Archive restoration.\nOriginal reception.\nDespite the film's later reputation, some contemporary critics panned it. \"Variety\"'s first review of the film in Berlin considered the scenario to be weak and felt that the artistic work had been wasted on the manufactured story although did acknowledge that nothing had been filmed like it before and its effect was positively overwhelming and that there were some exceptional performances. Critic Mordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" called it a \"technical marvel with feet of clay\". A review by H. G. Wells dated 17 April 1927 accused it of \"foolishness, clich\u00e9, platitude, and muddlement about mechanical progress and progress in general\". He faulted \"Metropolis\" for its premise that automation created drudgery rather than relieving it, wondered who was buying the machines' output if not the workers, and found parts of the story derivative of Shelley's \"Frankenstein\", Karel \u010capek's \"R.U.R.\", and his own \"The Sleeper Awakes\". Wells called \"Metropolis\" \"quite the silliest film\", but the \"New York Herald Tribune\" called it \"a weird and fascinating picture\".\nIn \"The New Yorker\" Oliver Claxton called \"Metropolis\" \"unconvincing and overlong\", faulting much of the plot as \"laid on with a terrible Teutonic heaviness, and an unnecessary amount of philosophizing in the beginning\" that made the film \"as soulless as the city of its tale\". He also called the acting \"uninspired with the exception of Brigitte Helm\". Nevertheless, Claxton wrote that \"the setting, the use of people and their movement, and various bits of action stand out as extraordinary and make it nearly an obligatory picture.\" Other critics considered the film a remarkable achievement that surpassed even its high expectations, praising its visual splendour and ambitious production values.\nA month after their first review, \"Variety\" founder Sime Silverman reviewed the film in New York and considered the film to have mass appeal but called it \"a weird story, visionary all of the time, without any degree of unusual imagination and offtimes monotonous\".\nNazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels was impressed with the film's message of social justice. In a 1928 speech, he said, \"the political bourgeoisie is about to leave the stage of history. In its place advance the oppressed producers of the head and hand, the forces of Labor, to begin their historical mission\". Shortly after the Nazis came to power, Goebbels told Lang that, on the basis of their seeing \"Metropolis\" together years before, Hitler had said that he wanted Lang to make Nazi films.\nGerman cultural critic Siegfried Kracauer later wrote of \"Metropolis\", \"The Americans relished its technical excellence; the English remained aloof; the French were stirred by a film which seemed to them a blend of [composer] Wagner and [armaments manufacturer] Krupp, and on the whole an alarming sign of Germany's vitality.\"\nLang later expressed dissatisfaction with the film. In an interview with Peter Bogdanovich in \"Who the Devil Made It: Conversations with Legendary Film Directors\", published in 1998, he expressed his reservations:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The main thesis was Mrs. Von Harbou's, but I am at least 50 percent responsible because I did it. I was not so politically minded in those days as I am now. You cannot make a social-conscious picture in which you say that the intermediary between the hand and the brain is the heart. I mean, that's a fairy tale\u2014definitely. But I was very interested in machines. Anyway, I didn't like the picture\u2014thought it was silly and stupid\u2014then, when I saw the astronauts: what else are they but part of a machine? It's very hard to talk about pictures\u2014should I say now that I like \"Metropolis\" because something I have seen in my imagination comes true, when I detested it after it was finished?\nIn his profile of Lang, which introduced the interview, Bogdanovich suggested that Lang's distaste for his film also stemmed from the Nazi Party's fascination with it. Von Harbou became a member of the Party in 1933. She and Lang divorced the following year. Lang later moved to the United States to escape the Nazis, while Harbou stayed in Germany and continued to write state-approved films.\nLater acclaim.\nAccording to Roger Ebert, \"\"Metropolis\" is one of the great achievements of the silent era, a work so audacious in its vision and so angry in its message that it is, if anything, more powerful today than when it was made.\" Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide's entry on the film reads, \"Heavy going at times but startling set design and special effects command attention throughout.\"\nColin Greenland reviewed \"Metropolis\" for \"Imagine\" magazine, and stated that \"It's a measure of the sheer power of Lang's vision that it survives this heavy-handed cosmetic modernizing quite intact. Inspired by his first sight of Manhattan, Metropolis is a dark dream of the city of 2026, where the idle rich live in penthouses and play in rooftop pleasure gardens while the faceless workers toil in the machine caverns far, far below.\"\nThe film has an approval rating of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 126 reviews, with an average rating of 9.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A visually awe-inspiring science fiction classic from the silent era.\" In Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 98 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". It also ranked 12th in \"Empire\" magazine's \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\" in 2010. The 2002 version was awarded the New York Film Critics Circle Awards \"Special Award\" for the restoration. In 2012, in correspondence with the \"Sight &amp; Sound\" Poll, the British Film Institute called \"Metropolis\" the 35th-greatest film of all time. In the 2022 version of the poll, \"Metropolis\" fell slightly to 67th place.\nLane Roth in \"Film Quarterly\" called it a \"seminal film\" because of its concerns with the \"profound impact technological progress has on man's social and spiritual progress\" and concluded that \"ascendancy of artifact over nature is depicted not as liberating man, but as subjugating and corrupting him\". Martin Scorsese included it on a list of \"39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker.\"\nExploring the dramatic production background and historical importance of the film's complex political context in \"The American Conservative\", film historian Cristobal Catalan suggests \"Metropolis is a passionate call, and equally a passionate caution, for social change\". Peter Bradshaw noted that the \"Maschinenmensch\" based on Maria is \"a brilliant eroticisation and fetishisation of modern technology\".\nThe film was included by the Vatican in a list of important films compiled in 1995, under the category of \"Art\".\nRestorations.\nThe original premiere cut of \"Metropolis\" has been lost, and for decades the film could be seen only in heavily truncated edits that lacked nearly a quarter of the original length. This was the case even though cinematographer Karl Freund followed the usual practice of the time of securing three printable takes of each shot in order to create three camera negatives which could be edited for striking prints. Two of these negatives were destroyed when Paramount reedited the film for the US market and the UK market. UFA itself cut the third negative for the August 1927 release. But over the years, various elements of footage have been rediscovered.\nEast German version (1972).\nBetween 1968 and 1972, the Staatliches Filmarchiv der DDR, with the help of film archives from around the world, put together a version of \"Metropolis\" which restored some scenes and footage, but the effort was hobbled by a lack of a guide, such as an original script, to determine what, exactly, was in the original version.\nGiorgio Moroder version (1984).\nIn 1984, a new restoration and edit of the film, running 83 minutes, was made by Italian music producer Giorgio Moroder, who paid $200,000 for the rights, outbidding his \"Cat People\" collaborator David Bowie. Although Moroder initially intended only to create a new soundtrack, he was surprised by the lack of a definitive print, and expanded his project to a major reconstruction. Moroder's version, which was made in consultation with the Munich Film Archive and their archivist, Enno Patalas, was tinted to emphasise the different moods and locations in the film. It also featured additional special effects, replaced intertitles of character dialogue with subtitles and incorporated a soundtrack featuring songs Moroder composed, produced and recorded with popular artists such as Freddie Mercury, Bonnie Tyler, Pat Benatar, Adam Ant and Jon Anderson. It was the first serious attempt made at restoring \"Metropolis\" to Lang's original vision, and until the restorations in 2001 and 2010, it was the most complete version of the film commercially available. The shorter run time was due to the extensive use of subtitles for spoken lines instead of title cards, a faster frame rate than the original, and the fact that large amounts of footage were still missing at the time.\nMoroder's version of \"Metropolis\" generally received poor reviews. Moroder responded to the critics who lambasted his production for not being faithful to the original in \"The New York Times\": \"I didn't touch the original because there is no original.\" The film was nominated for two Raspberry Awards, Worst Original Song for Mercury\u2019s \"Love Kills\" and Worst Musical Score for Moroder. However, Bonnie Tyler was nominated for Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the 27th Grammy Awards for \"Here She Comes\".\nIn August 2011, after years of the Moroder version being unavailable on video in any format due to music licensing problems, it was announced that Kino International had managed to resolve the situation, and the film was to be released on Blu-ray and DVD in November. In addition, the film enjoyed a limited theatrical re-release.\nIn 2012, the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films gave \"Giorgio Moroder Presents Metropolis\" a Saturn Award for Best DVD/Blu-Ray Special Edition Release.\nMunich Archive version (1987).\nThe moderate commercial success of the Moroder version inspired Enno Patalas, the archivist of the Munich Film Archive, to make an exhaustive attempt to restore the movie in 1986. Starting from the version in the Museum of Modern Art collection, this version took advantage of new acquisitions and newly discovered German censorship records of the original inter-titles, as well as the musical score and other materials from the estate of composer Gottfried Huppertz. The Munich restoration also used newly rediscovered still photographs to represent scenes that were still missing from the film. The Munich version was 9,840 feet, or 109 minutes long.\n\"Restored Authorized Edition\" (2001).\nIn 1998, Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung commissioned film preservationist Martin Koerber to create a \"definitive\" restoration of \"Metropolis\" by expanding on the Munich version. Previously unknown sections of the film were discovered in film museums and archives around the world, including a nitrate original camera negative from the Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv, as well as nitrate prints from the George Eastman House, the British Film Institute and the Cineteca Italiana. These original film elements, digitally cleaned and repaired to remove defects, were used to assemble the film. Newly written intertitles were used to explain missing scenes.\nThe 2001 restoration premiered on 15 February 2001 at the Berlin Film Festival, with a new score by Bernd Schultheis, performed live by the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin. For theatrical and DVD release, it featured a new recording of Huppertz's original score performed by a 65-piece orchestra. The running time is 124 minutes at 24 fps, and it was released internationally on various DVD editions beginning in 2003. This version of \"Metropolis\" was added to UNESCO's Memory of the World International Register in 2001, recognising it as a cultural work of global importance. It was the first film to achieve this status.\n\"The Complete Metropolis\" (2010).\nOn 1 July 2008, film experts in Berlin announced that a 16\u00a0mm reduction negative of the original cut had been discovered in the archives of the Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The negative was a safety reduction made in the 1960s or 1970s from a 35\u00a0mm positive of Lang's original version, which an Argentinian film distributor had obtained in advance of arranging theatrical engagements in South America. The safety reduction was intended to safeguard the contents in case the original's flammable nitrate film stock was destroyed. The negative was passed to a private collector, an art foundation and finally the Museo del Cine.\nThe print was investigated by the Argentinian film collector/historian and TV presenter Fernando Mart\u00edn Pe\u00f1a, along with Paula Felix-Didier, the head of the museum, after Pe\u00f1a heard an anecdote from a cinema club manager expressing surprise at the length of a print of \"Metropolis\" he had viewed. The print was indeed Lang's full original, with about 25 minutes of footage, around one-fifth of the film, that had not been seen since 1927.\nUnder the auspices of the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung, Berlin's Deutsche Kinemathek and Museo del Cine, a group of experts, including Anke Wilkening, Martin Koerber, and Frank Strobel began combining the newly discovered footage with the existing footage from the 2001 restoration. A major problem was that the Argentinian footage was in poor condition and had many scratches, streaks, and changes in brightness. The group was able to repair some of this damage using digital technology that had not yet been developed in 2001. The reconstruction of the film with the new footage was once again accompanied by the original music score, including Huppertz's handwritten notes, which acted as the key resource in determining the places in which the restored footage would go. Since the Argentinian print was a complete version of the original, some scenes from the 2001 restoration were put in different places than previously, and the tempo of the original editing was restored.\nIn 2005, Australian historian and politician Michael Organ had examined a print of the film in the National Film Archive of New Zealand. Organ discovered that the print contained scenes missing from other copies of the film. After hearing of the discovery of the Argentine print of the film and the restoration project, Organ contacted the German restorers; the New Zealand print contained 11 missing scenes and featured some brief pieces of footage that were used to restore damaged sections of the Argentine print. It is believed that the New Zealand and Argentine prints were all sourced from the same master. The newly discovered footage was used in the restoration project. The Argentine print was in poor condition and required considerable restoration before it was re-premiered in February 2010. Two short sequences, depicting a monk preaching and a fight between Rotwang and Fredersen, were damaged beyond repair. Title cards describing the action were inserted by the restorers to compensate. The Argentine print revealed new scenes that enriched the film's narrative complexity. The characters of Josaphat, the Thin Man, and 11811 appear throughout the film and the character Hel is reintroduced.\nThe 2010 restoration was premiered on 12 February 2010 at the Berlin Friedrichstadtpalast. Huppertz's score was performed by the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Frank Strobel, who also re-recorded it for theatrical and home video release. The performance was a gala screening as part of the 60th Berlinale and had several simultaneous screenings. It was also shown on an outdoor screen at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate, as well as at the Alte Oper in Frankfurt am Main. The Brandenburg Gate screening was also telecast live by the Arte network. The North American premiere took place at the 2010 TCM Classic Film Festival in Mann's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on 25 April 2010. The restoration has a running time of 148 minutes (or nearly 2.5 hours) and was released internationally on various DVD and Blu-ray editions beginning in 2010.\nCopyright status.\nThe American copyright for \"Metropolis\" lapsed in 1953, which later led to a proliferation of versions being released on video. Along with other foreign-made works, the film's U.S. copyright was restored in 1996 by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act; the constitutionality of this copyright extension was challenged, but was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012's \"Golan v. Holder\". This had the effect of restoring the copyright in the work as of 1 January 1996.\nUnder current U.S. copyright law, \"Metropolis\" entered the public domain on 1 January 2023; the U.S. copyright limit for films of its age is 95 years from publication per the Copyright Term Extension Act.\nUnder current EU copyright law, the film will remain under copyright in Germany and the rest of the European Union until the end of 2046, 70 years after Fritz Lang's death.\nIn popular culture.\nFollowing are mentions of the film in popular culture:\nReferences.\nInformational notes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\nFurther reading"}
{"id": "49699", "revid": "6346494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49699", "title": "Sussex", "text": "Cultural and historic region of England\nSussex (; from the Old English \"S\u016b\u00feseaxe\"; lit.\u2009'South Saxons'; 'Sussex') is an area of South East England that was historically a kingdom and, later, a county. The current ceremonial counties of East Sussex and West Sussex cover approximately the same area. The two ceremonial counties border Surrey to the north, Kent to the north-east, the English Channel to the south, and Hampshire to the west. Sussex contains the city of Brighton and Hove and its wider city region, part of the South Downs National Park and the national landscape of the High Weald, and Chichester Harbour. Its coastline is long.\nThe Kingdom of Sussex emerged in the fifth century in the area that had previously been inhabited by the Regni tribe in the Romano-British period. In about 827, shortly after the Battle of Ellendun, Sussex was conquered by Wessex. From 860 it was ruled by the kings of Wessex, and in 927 it became part of the Kingdom of England. By the Norman period, Sussex was subdivided into six administrative districts known as rapes, which were themselves divided into hundreds. By the sixteenth century, the eastern three rapes and the western three rapes had been combined for most meetings of the court of quarter sessions, a division which was reinforced when the administrative counties of East Sussex and West Sussex were established in 1889. Subsequent local government reforms maintained the division into east and west. The county retained a single lord lieutenant and sheriff until 1974, when they were replaced with separate posts for East and West Sussex and Sussex lost its status as a ceremonial county. \nSussex is widely regarded as a single unified entity for some purposes, including provision of some public services, food and drink and sport. In 2007, Sussex Day was created to celebrate the county's culture and history. In February 2025, the UK Government approved plans to devolve powers to a new combined county authority for East Sussex, West Sussex, and Brighton and Hove, to be headed by a directly elected mayor.\nToponymy.\nThe name \"Sussex\" is derived from the Middle English , which is in turn derived from the Old English , meaning \"(land or people) of the South Saxons\" (cf. Essex, Middlesex and Wessex). The South Saxons were a Germanic tribe that settled in the region from the North German Plain during the fifth and sixth centuries.\nThe earliest-known usage of the term South Saxons (Latin: ) is in a royal charter of 689 which names them and their king, No\u00f0helm, although the term may well have been in use for some time before that. The monastic chronicler who wrote up the entry classifying the invasion seems to have got his dates wrong; recent scholars have suggested he might have been a quarter of a century too late.\nIn the Domesday Book of 1086, Sussex is recorded as \"Sudsexe\".\nThree United States counties (in Delaware, New Jersey and Virginia), and a former county/land division of Western Australia, are named after Sussex.\nSymbols.\nThe flag of Sussex consists of six gold martlets, or heraldic swallows, on a blue background, blazoned as \"Azure, six martlets or\". Recognised by the Flag Institute on 20 May 2011, its design is based on the heraldic shield of Sussex. The first-known recording of this emblem being used to represent the county was in 1611 when cartographer John Speed deployed it to represent the Kingdom of the South Saxons. However, it seems that Speed was repeating an earlier association between the emblem and the county, rather than being the inventor of the association. It is now firmly regarded that the county emblem originated and derived from the coat of arms of the 14th-century Knight of the Shire, Sir John de Radynden. Sussex's six martlets are today held to symbolise the traditional six sub-divisions of the county known as \"rapes\".\n\"Sussex by the Sea\" is regarded as the unofficial anthem of Sussex; it was composed by William Ward-Higgs in 1907, perhaps originally from the lyrics of Rudyard Kipling's poem entitled \"Sussex\". Adopted by the Royal Sussex Regiment and popularised in World War I, it is sung at celebrations across the county, including those at Lewes Bonfire, and at sports matches, including those of Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club and Sussex County Cricket Club.\nThe county day, called Sussex Day, is celebrated annually on 16 June, the feast day of St Richard of Chichester, Sussex's patron saint, whose shrine at Chichester Cathedral was an important place of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages.\nSussex's motto, \"We wunt be druv\", is a Sussex dialect expression meaning \"we will not be pushed around\" and reflects the traditionally independent nature of Sussex men and women. The round-headed rampion, also known as the \"Pride of Sussex\", was adopted as Sussex's county flower in 2002.\nGeography.\nLandscape.\nThe physical geography of Sussex relies heavily on its lying on the southern part of the Wealden anticline, the major features of which are the high lands that cross the county in a west to east direction: the Weald itself and the South Downs. Natural England has identified the following seven national character areas in Sussex:\nAt , Blackdown is the highest point in Sussex, or county top. With a height of Ditchling Beacon is the highest point in East Sussex. At long, the River Medway is the longest river flowing through Sussex. The longest river entirely in Sussex is the River Arun, which is long. Sussex's largest lakes are man-made reservoirs. The largest is Bewl Water on the Kent border, while the largest wholly within Sussex is Ardingly Reservoir.\nClimate.\nThe coastal resorts of Sussex and neighbouring Hampshire are the sunniest places in the United Kingdom. The coast has consistently more sunshine than the inland areas: sea breezes, blowing off the sea, tend to clear any cloud from the coast. The sunshine average is approximately 1,900 hours a year; this is much higher than the UK average of 1,340 hours a year. Most of Sussex lies in hardiness zone 8; the exception is the coastal plain west of Brighton, which lies in the milder zone 9.\nRainfall is below average with the heaviest precipitation on the South Downs with of rainfall per year. The close proximity of Sussex to the Continent of Europe, results in cold spells in winter and hot, humid weather in summer.\nThe climate of the coastal districts is strongly influenced by the sea, which, because of its tendency to warm up slower than land, can result in cooler temperatures than inland in the summer. In the autumn months, the coast sometimes has higher temperatures. Rainfall during the summer months is mainly from thunderstorms and thundery showers; from January to March the heavier rainfall is due to prevailing south-westerly frontal systems.\nIn winter, the east winds can be as cold as further inland. Selsey is known as a tornado hotspot, with small tornadoes hitting the town in 1986, 1998 and 2000, with the 1998 tornado causing an estimated \u00a310 million of damage to 1,000 buildings.\nConurbations.\nMost of Sussex's population is distributed in an east\u2013west line along the English Channel coast or on the east\u2013west line of the A272. The exception to this pattern is the 20th-century north\u2013south development on the A23-Brighton line corridor, Sussex's main link to London. Sussex's population is dominated by the Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation that, with a population of more than 470,000, is home to almost 1 in 3 of Sussex's population. According to the ONS urban area populations for continuous built-up areas, these are the five largest conurbations:\nPopulation.\nThe combined population of Sussex as of 2021 was about 1.7 million. In 2021, Sussex had a population density of 451 per km2, higher than the average for England of 434 per km2.\nThe decline of the Sussex ironworks probably accounts for the small increase in population during several centuries, although after the Massacre of St Bartholomew upwards of 1,500 Huguenots landed at Rye, and in 1685, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, many more refugees were added to the county. The population of Sussex was 550,446 in 1891 and 605,202 in 1901.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nFinds at Eartham Pit in Boxgrove show that the area has some of the earliest hominid remains in Europe, dating back some 500,000 years and known as Boxgrove Man or \"Homo heidelbergensis\". At a site near Pulborough called The Beedings, tools have been found that date from around 35,000 years ago and that are thought to be from either the last Neanderthals in northern Europe or pioneer populations of modern humans. The thriving population lived by hunting game such as horses, bison, mammoths and woolly rhinos. Around 6000 BC, the ice sheet over the North Sea melted, sea levels rose and the meltwaters burst south and westwards, creating the English Channel and cutting the people of Sussex off from their Mesolithic kinsmen to the south. Later in the Neolithic period, the area of the South Downs above Worthing was one of Britain's largest and most important flint-mining centres. The flints were used to help fell trees for agriculture. The oldest of these mines, at Church Hill in Findon, has been carbon-dated to 4500 BC to 3750 BC, making it one of the earliest known mines in Britain. Flint tools from Cissbury have been found as far away as the eastern Mediterranean.\nSussex is rich in remains from the Bronze and Iron Ages, in particular the Bronze Age barrows known as the Devil's Jumps and Cissbury Ring, one of Britain's largest hillforts. Towards the end of the Iron Age in 75 BC people from the Atrebates, one of the tribes of the Belgae, a mix of Celtic and German stock, invaded and occupied southern Britain. This was followed by an invasion by the Roman army under Julius Caesar that temporarily occupied south-eastern Britain in 55 BC.\nSoon after the first Roman invasion had ended, the Celtic Regni tribe under their leader Commius initially occupied the Manhood Peninsula. Eppillus, Verica and Cogidubnus followed Commius as rulers of the Regni or southern Atrebates, a region which included most of Sussex, with their capital in the Selsey area.\nRoman canton.\nA number of archaeologists now think there is a strong possibility that the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43 started around Fishbourne and Chichester Harbour rather than the traditional landing place of Richborough in Kent. According to this theory, the Romans were called to restore the refugee Verica, a king whose capital was in the Selsey and Chichester area, who had been driven out by the Catuvellauni, a tribe based around modern Hertfordshire.\nMuch of Sussex was a Roman canton of the Regni, probably taking a similar area to the pre-Roman tribal area and kingdom. Its capital was at Noviomagus Reginorum, modern-day Chichester, close to the pre-Roman capital of the area, around Selsey. Sussex was home to the magnificent Roman Palace at Fishbourne, by far the largest Roman residence known north of the Alps. The Romans built villas, especially on the coastal plain and around Chichester, one of the best preserved being that at Bignor. Christianity first came to Sussex at this time, but faded away when the Romans left in the fifth century. The nationally important Patching hoard of Roman coins that was found in 1997 is the latest find of Roman coins found in Britain, probably deposited after 475 AD, well after the Roman departure from Britain around 410 AD.\nKingdom of Sussex.\nThe foundation legend of Sussex is provided by the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", which states that in the year AD 477 \u00c6lle landed with his three sons. Having fought on the banks of the Mearcredesburna, it seems \u00c6lle secured the area between the Ouse and Cuckmere in a treaty. Traditionally this is thought to have been against native Britons, but it may have been to secure the area east of the Saxon Shore fort of Anderida from the influence of the Kingdom of Kent, with whom the South Saxons may have had occasional disputes. \u00c6lle was recognised as the first 'Bretwalda' or overlord of southern Britain. He was probably the most senior of the Anglo-Saxon kings and led the ill-fated campaign against King Arthur at Mount Badon.\nBy the seventh century, South Saxon kings were ruling from sites around Selsey (the pre-Roman capital of the area) and Chichester (the Roman capital of the area) initially with similar borders to the pre-Roman kingdom and Roman canton. For much of the 7th and 8th centuries, Sussex suffered attempts at invasion from the Kingdom of Wessex to its west. King \u00c6\u00f0elwealh formed an alliance with Christian Mercia against Wessex, becoming Sussex's first Christian king. With support from St Wilfrid, Sussex became the last major Anglo Saxon kingdom to become Christian. South Saxon and Mercian forces took control of what is now east Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. C\u00e6dwalla of Wessex killed \u00c6\u00f0elwealh and \"ravaged Sussex by fierce slaughter and devastation\". The South Saxons forced C\u00e6dwalla from Sussex and were able to lead a campaign into Kent, replacing its king. At this time Sussex could have re-emerged into a regional power. Shortly afterwards, C\u00e6dwalla returned to Sussex, killing its king and oppressing its people, putting them in what Bede called \"a worse state of slavery\". The South Saxon clergy were put under the control of West Saxon Winchester. Only around 715 was Eadberht of Selsey made the first bishop of the South Saxons, after which further invasion attempts from Wessex ensued.\nFollowing a period of rule by King Offa of Mercia, Sussex regained its independence but was annexed by Wessex around 827 and was fully absorbed into the crown of Wessex in 860, which later grew into the Kingdom of England.\nNorman Sussex.\nThe Battle of Hastings was fought in Sussex, the victory that led to the Norman conquest of England. In September 1066, William of Normandy landed with his forces at Pevensey and erected a wooden castle at Hastings, from which they raided the surrounding area. The battle was fought between Duke William of Normandy and the English king, Harold Godwinson, who had strong connections with Sussex and whose chief seat was probably in Bosham. After having marched his exhausted army from Yorkshire, Harold fought the Normans at the Battle of Hastings, where England's army was defeated and Harold was killed. It is likely that all the fighting men of Sussex were at the battle, as the county's thegns were decimated and any that survived had their lands confiscated. William built Battle Abbey at the site of the battle, with the exact spot where Harold fell marked by the high altar.\nSussex experienced some of the greatest changes of any English county under the Normans, for it was the heartland of King Harold and was potentially vulnerable to further invasion. In the immediate aftermath of the Normans' landing at Pevensey and the Battle of Hastings and to put an end to any rebellion, the Norman army destroyed estates and other assets on their route through Sussex, leading to a 40 per cent reduction in Sussex's wealth, a situation worse than any other southern or midland county. By 1086 wealth in Sussex was still 10 to 25 per cent lower than it had been in 1066.\nIt was also during the Norman period that Sussex achieved its greatest importance in comparison with other English counties. Sussex was on the main route between England and Normandy, and the lands of the Anglo-Norman nobility in what is now western France. The growth in Sussex's population, the importance of its ports and the increased colonisation of the Weald were all part of changes as significant to Sussex as those brought by the neolithic period, by the Romans and the Saxons. Sussex also experienced the most radical and thorough reorganisation of land in England. The county's existing sub-divisions, known as rapes, were made into castleries and each territory was given to one of William's most trusted barons. Castles were built to defend the territories including at Arundel, Bramber, Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings. Sussex's bishop, \u00c6thelric II, was deposed and imprisoned and replaced with William the Conqueror's personal chaplain, Stigand. The Normans also built Chichester Cathedral and moved the seat of Sussex's bishopric from Selsey to Chichester. The Normans also founded new towns in Sussex, including New Shoreham (the centre of modern Shoreham-by-Sea), Battle, Arundel, Uckfield and Winchelsea.\nSussex under the Plantagenets.\nIn 1264, the Sussex Downs were the location of the Battle of Lewes, in which Simon de Montfort and his fellow barons captured Prince Edward (later Edward I), the son and heir of Henry III. The subsequent treaty, known as the Mise of Lewes, led to Montfort summoning the first parliament in English history without any prior royal authorisation. A provisional administration was set up, consisting of Montfort, the Bishop of Chichester and the Earl of Gloucester. These three were to elect a council of nine, to govern until a permanent settlement could be reached.\nDuring the Hundred Years' War, Sussex found itself on the frontline, convenient both for intended invasions and retaliatory expeditions by licensed French pirates. Hastings, Rye and Winchelsea were all burnt during this period and all three towns became part of the Cinque Ports, a loose federation for supplying ships for the country's security. Also at this time, Amberley and Bodiam castles were built to defend the upper reaches of navigable rivers.\nOne of the impacts of the war and the Black Death, which killed around half of the population of Sussex, was the perceived injustice that led many Sussex people to participate in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Coastal areas suffered most from the Black Death, and took longest to recover. Instead much economic activity in Sussex was focused on the Weald. Merchants moved north from the coastal towns and many Continental craftsmen, fleeing religious persecution, brought their expertise to the timber, iron, clothmaking and glass industries. Economic and social tensions continued for many years as Sussex people were also involved in Jack Cade's rebellion of 1450, in which Cade may have been killed at Cade Street, near Heathfield. Demands grew more radical in Sussex in 1451 when John and William Merfold advocated rule by common people. They also demanded that Henry VI be deposed and publicly incited the killing of the nobility and clergy.\nEarly modern Sussex.\nThe Wealden iron industry expanded rapidly, especially after the first blast furnace arrived in Sussex in 1496, from the Low Countries, which greatly improved efficiency. Skilled Flemish workers moved to Sussex, followed again by Huguenot craftsmen from France, who brought new techniques. The industry was strategically important and flourished into the 17th century, after which it began to decline. It also brought widespread deforestation of parts of the Sussex Weald.\nHenry VIII's separation of the Church of England from Rome and the dissolution of the monasteries led to the demolition of Lewes Priory and Battle Abbey and the sites being given to Henry's supporters. The shrine to St Richard at Chichester Cathedral was also destroyed. Mary I returned England to Catholicism and in Sussex 41 Protestants were burned to death. Under Elizabeth I, religious intolerance continued albeit on a lesser scale, with several people being executed for their Catholic beliefs. In Elizabeth's reign, Sussex was open to the older Protestant forms practised in the Weald as well as the newer Protestant forms coming from Continental Europe; combined with a significant Catholic presence, Sussex was in many ways out of step with the rest of southern England.\nSussex escaped the worst ravages of the English Civil War, although control of the Wealden iron industry was strategically important to both sides. In 1642 there was a skirmish at Haywards Heath when Royalists marching towards Lewes were intercepted by local Parliamentarians. The Royalists were routed with around 200 killed or taken prisoner. Shortly after there were sieges at Chichester and Arundel, and a smaller battle at Bramber Bridge. Despite its being under Parliamentarian control, Charles II was able to journey through the county after the Battle of Worcester in 1651 to make his escape to France from the port of Shoreham.\nIn 1681 Charles II granted William Penn lands in what became Pennsylvania and Delaware. Amongst those whom he carried to North America as colonists were 200 people from Sussex, mostly Quakers, who founded settlements named after places in Sussex including Lewes and Seaford in Sussex County, Delaware and Horsham Township and Chichester in Pennsylvania.\nThe Sussex coast was greatly modified by the social movement of sea bathing for health which became fashionable among the wealthy in the second half of the 18th century. Resorts developed all along the coast, including at Brighton, Hastings, Worthing, and Bognor.\nLate modern and contemporary Sussex.\nPoverty increased and by 1801 Sussex had the highest poor law rates in England, with 23 per cent of its population (37,000 people out of 160,000) living on the breadline and receiving regular relief. Socially acceptable crimes, including protest, riot, collective action and smuggling were commonplace in Sussex and were seen by many as a legitimate way to address grievances and assert freedoms. At this time, Sussex became a centre for radicalism. Thomas Paine developed his political ideas in Lewes, and later wrote \"Common Sense\" which was influential in the American Revolution. Known as 'the radical duke', Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond, was an early supporter of parliamentary reform and US independence. Richard Cobden was a product of Sussex's rural radicalism, and became a campaigner for free trade and peace. Poet Percy Bysshe Shelley was another influential radical from Sussex.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century agricultural labourers' conditions took a turn for the worse with an increasing amount of them becoming unemployed, those in work faced their wages being forced down. Conditions became so bad that it was even reported to the House of Lords in 1830 that four harvest labourers (seasonal workers) had been found dead of starvation. The deteriorating conditions of work for the agricultural labourer eventually triggered riots, first in neighbouring Kent, and then in Sussex, where they lasted for several weeks, although the unrest continued until 1832 and became known as the Swing Riots.\nDuring World War I, on 30 June 1916, the Royal Sussex Regiment took part in the Battle of the Boar's Head at Richebourg-l'Avou\u00e9. The day subsequently became known as The Day Sussex Died. Within five hours the 17 officers and 349 men were killed, and 1,000 men were wounded or taken prisoner. In 1918 the terms of the armistice to be offered to Germany at the end of World War I were agreed at a meeting at Danny House, Hurstpierpoint. With the declaration of World War II, Sussex found itself part of the country's frontline with its airfields playing a key role in the Battle of Britain and with its towns being some of the most frequently bombed. Sussex was garrisoned by multiple British and Canadian Army units from 1940 until at least May 1942. During the lead up to the Dieppe Raid and D-Day landings, the people of Sussex were witness to the buildup of military personnel and materials, including the assembly of landing crafts and construction of Mulberry harbours off the county's coast.\nIn the post-war era, the New Towns Act 1946 designated Crawley as the site of a new town. As part of the Local Government Act 1972, the eastern and western divisions of Sussex were made into the ceremonial counties of East and West Sussex in 1974. Boundaries were changed and a large part of the rape of Lewes was transferred from the eastern division into West Sussex, along with Gatwick Airport, historically part of the county of Surrey.\nGovernance.\nPolitics.\nIn February 2025, Government ministers approved proposals under the English Devolution Bill to create a strategic authority for Sussex. Devolved areas of responsibility would include transport, public safety, health, the environment and climate change, housing, economic growth, skills and jobs. Under these proposals, the people of Sussex could directly elect a Mayor of Sussex and Brighton to oversee the strategic authority as soon as May 2026. The strategic authority would also see the abolition of the Greater Brighton City Region and all of the existing local authorities in Sussex, to be replaced by at least three unitary authorities, to be based significantly on the areas currently covered by East Sussex County Council, West Sussex County Council and Brighton and Hove City Council. The post of Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner would also be abolished under the proposals.\nAmongst top-tier local authorities, East and West Sussex County Councils are both held by the Conservatives and Brighton and Hove City Council is led by Labour. Amongst district councils, as of June 2024, the Lib Dems had a majority in three local authorities (Chichester, Eastbourne and Horsham) and the Labour Party had a majority in three local authorities (Adur, Crawley and Worthing). Of the six local authorities in no overall control, one had a minority Green administration (Hastings), one was run by a Lib Dem-Labour-Green coalition (Arun), one was run by a Green-Labour coalition (Lewes), one as run by a Lib Dem-Independent coalition (Mid Sussex) one was run by an Independent-Labour-Lib Dem-Green coalition (Rother) and one had a Lib Dem-Green coalition (Wealden). Conservative Katy Bourne is the Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner, having first been elected in 2012.\nIn the House of Commons, the lower house of the UK Parliament, Sussex is represented by 17 MPs. At the 2024 general election, 6 Labour and Labour Co-op MPs, 5 Conservative MPs, 5 Lib Dem MPs and 1 Green MP were elected from Sussex constituencies.\nFrom 1290, Sussex returned two Members of Parliament to the House of Commons of the Parliament of England. Each county returned two MPs and each borough designated by Royal charter also returned two MPs. After the union with Scotland two members represented the county in the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1707 to 1800 and of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1832. The Reform Act 1832 led to the disenfranchisement of some of the smaller Sussex boroughs and divided what had been a single county constituency into eastern and western divisions, with two representatives elected for each division. The reforms of the 19th century made the electoral system more representative, but it was not until 1928 that there was universal suffrage.\nThere was a strong radical and republican tradition in Sussex from the 19th century. For most of the 20th century Sussex was a Conservative Party stronghold\u2014from the 1906 to 1997 general elections the only seats in Sussex won by parties other than the Conservatives were in the constituencies of Brighton and Brighton Kemptown. Since 1997 there has been a gradual shift to the left, especially in more urban areas. This has been most notable in Brighton and Hove, where in Brighton Pavilion the UK's first Green MP, Caroline Lucas, was elected in 2010 and the UK's first Green-led local authority was elected in 2011.\nIn the 2016 referendum on UK membership of the EU, the people of Sussex voted to leave the EU by the narrowest of margins, by 50.23% to 49.77% or 4,413 votes.\nLaw.\nHeadquartered in Lewes, Home Office policing in Sussex has been provided by Sussex Police since 1968.\nThe first-tier Crown Court for all of Sussex is Lewes Crown Court, which has courts in Lewes, Brighton and Hove. Like other first-tier Crown Courts it has its own resident High Court Judge. There is also a third-tier Crown Court at Chichester. The local prison in Sussex for men is Lewes Prison and there is also a Category D prison at Ford.\nAdministrative divisions.\nHistoric sub-divisions.\nA rape is a traditional territorial sub-division of Sussex, formerly used for various administrative purposes. Their origin is unknown, but they appear to predate the Norman Conquest Each rape was split into several hundreds and may be Romano-British or Anglo-Saxon in origin.\nAt the time of the Norman Conquest, there were four rapes: Arundel, Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings. The rape of Bramber was created later in the 11th century and the rape of Chichester was created in the 13th century.\nModern local authority areas.\nLocal government in Sussex has been subject to periodic review over time. Currently, Sussex is currently divided into\nThere is a two-tier structure for East Sussex and West Sussex with education, social services, libraries, public transport and waste disposal carried out by the county councils and local planning and building control carried out by the district and borough councils.\nFor the governance of a long narrow territory it became practical to divide the county into two sections. The three eastern rapes of Sussex became east Sussex and the three western rapes became west Sussex. This began in 1504, with separate administrations (Quarter Sessions) for east and west, a situation recognised by the County of Sussex Act 1865. Under the Local Government Act 1888, the two divisions became two administrative counties (along with three county boroughs (Brighton, Hastings and, from 1911, Eastbourne) that were independent of the administrative counties).\nEconomy.\nDespite its location in the prosperous South East of England, there is considerable economic variation within Sussex. In most areas within Sussex, economic output is close to or significantly lower than the UK average and is far below the average for South East England. For statistical purposes, the UK Government pairs Sussex at the NUTS2 level with Surrey, a significantly better off region, which to some degree masks the level of deprivation in Sussex. In 2018 the four Sussex statistical areas at the NUTS3 level had a GDP per head that varied between \u00a318,852 (58.6% of the UK average) and \u00a333,711 (104.6% of the UK average), and was typically below the UK average of \u00a332,216. This was in contrast to the two areas in Surrey, which had a GDP per head of \u00a337,429 and \u00a342,433, well above the UK average. There is also serious deprivation in Sussex comparable to the most deprived UK inner city areas. Some areas of Sussex are in the top 5 per cent most deprived in the UK and, in some areas, two-thirds of children are living in poverty. In 2011, two Local Enterprise Partnerships were formed to improve the economy in Sussex. These were the Coast to Capital LEP, covering West Sussex, Brighton and Hove and the Lewes district in the west of East Sussex, as well as parts of Surrey and South London; and the South East LEP, which covers the local authority area of East Sussex, as well as Kent and Essex. In the most populous part of Sussex, around the Brighton and Hove Built-up area, the Greater Brighton City Deal was formed to enable the area to fulfil its economic potential, into one of the highest performing urban economies in the UK.\nTourism in Sussex is well established, and includes seaside resorts and the South Downs National Park. Brighton and Hove has a high density of businesses involved in media, particularly digital or \"new media\"; since the 1990s Brighton has been referred to as \"Silicon Beach\". The Greater Brighton City Deal seeks to develop Brighton's creative-tech cluster under the name Tech City South. The University of Sussex and the University of Brighton provide employment for many more. A large part of the county, centred on Gatwick Airport has been recognised as a key economic growth area for South East England while reasonable rail connections allow many people to work in London.\nSeveral large companies are based in Sussex including American Express (Brighton), The Body Shop (Littlehampton), Bowers &amp; Wilkins (Worthing), Hastings Insurance and Park Holidays UK (Bexhill), Ricardo plc (Shoreham-by-Sea), Rolls-Royce Motor Cars (Goodwood), Thales UK (Crawley), Alfa Laval (Eastbourne) and Virgin Atlantic (Crawley).\nThe Sussex Weald had an iron working industry from the Iron Age until the 19th century. The glass making industry started on the Sussex/Surrey border throughout the late medieval period until the 17th century. Agriculture in Sussex depended on the terrain, so in the sticky clays and acid sands of the Sussex Weald, pastoral and mixed farming took place, with sheep farming being common on the chalk downland. Fishing fleets continue to operate along the coast, notably at Rye and Hastings. There are working harbours at Rye, Hastings, Newhaven and Shoreham; while Pagham, Eastbourne and Chichester harbours cater for leisure craft, as does Brighton Marina. The Mid Sussex area had a thriving clay industry in the early 20th century.\nTransport.\nSussex's two main trunk roads are maintained by the UK Department for Transport - these are the A27/A259, which runs east-west along the coast, linking Chichester, Worthing, Brighton and Lewes and Hastings; and the A23/M23 which runs north-south, connecting Brighton and Crawley with Gatwick Airport and London. Other routes are maintained by local authorities and main routes include the A21 (Hastings to London), A22 (Eastbourne to London), and A24 (Worthing to London).\nRail transport in Sussex is provided by the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) on the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise. This includes the Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express brands. Principle routes include the Brighton Mainline, East Coastway line, West Coastway line, Arun Valley line and Marshlink line. Since the 2010s it has been several interested parties have been examining the possibility of reopening the Uckfield \u2014 Lewes line, which would provide an alternative route to London to the Brighton Mainline.\nLocated 3 miles north of Crawley town centre is Gatwick Airport, the UK's second-busiest and in 2024 the 10th busiest airport in the world. Sussex has two commercial ports, th ports of Newhaven and Shoreham-by-Sea. Connected to Newhaven Harbour railway station, DFDS provides a cross-channel passenger ferry service from the port of Newhaven to Dieppe in Normandy, France. From Dieppe there are rail services that provide onward connections to Rouen and Paris.\nEducation.\nThe oldest university in Sussex is the research intensive University of Sussex, founded in 1961 at Falmer in Brighton, the first new university in England since World War II. The university consistently ranks among the top 20 universities in the UK. It is home to the Institute of Development Studies and the Science Policy Research Unit, alongside more than 40 other established research centres.\nIn 1992 it was joined by the University of Brighton (with campuses in Brighton, Eastbourne and Hastings) and in 2005 by the University of Chichester (with campuses in Chichester and Bognor Regis). Validated by University of the Arts London, higher education is also provided at Greater Brighton Metropolitan College, whose campuses in Brighton, Worthing and Shoreham-by-Sea are referred to as MET University Centre.\nThe Prebendal School in Chichester is the oldest known school in Sussex and probably dates to when the Normans moved the Sussex bishopric from Selsey to Chichester Cathedral in the 11th century. Primary and secondary education in the state sector in Sussex is provided by its three local education authorities of East and West Sussex County Councils and Brighton and Hove City Council. Sussex also has some of the best-known independent schools in England including Christ's Hospital School, Brighton College, Eastbourne College, Lancing College and Battle Abbey School.\nHealthcare.\nThe Sussex County Hospital (now the Royal Sussex County Hospital) was founded in 1828 at Brighton while the Sussex County Mental Asylum (later 'St. Francis Hospital' and now the Princess Royal Hospital) was founded in 1859 in the centre of county at Haywards Heath.\nSussex's first medical school, the Brighton and Sussex Medical School, was set up in 2002. In 2011 the four Sussex NHS primary care trusts (PCTs) joined forces to become NHS Sussex. The Major Trauma Centre at the Royal Sussex County Hospital is the Major Trauma Centre for Sussex with the Sussex's other hospitals acting as trauma units. It is one of only five major trauma centres across the NHS's South of England area. The hospital also houses the Sussex Cancer Centre which serves most of Sussex.\nCulture.\nSussex has a centuries-old reputation for being separate and culturally distinct from the rest of England. The people of Sussex have a reputation for independence of thought and have an aversion to being pushed around, as expressed through the Sussex motto, We wunt be druv. Sussex is known for its strong tradition of bonfire celebrations and its proud musical heritage. Sussex in the first half of the 20th century was a major centre for modernism, and saw many radical artists and writers move to its seaside towns and countryside.\nThe county is home to the Brighton Festival and the Brighton Fringe, England's largest arts festival. Brighton Pride is one of the UK's largest and oldest gay pride parades and other pride events take place at most other major towns including Crawley, Eastbourne, Hastings and Worthing. Chichester is home to the Chichester Festival Theatre and Pallant House Gallery.\nArchitecture.\nSussex's building materials reflect its geology, being made of flint on and near the South Downs and sandstone in the Weald. Brick is used across the county.\nTypically conservative and moderate, the architecture of Sussex also has elaborate and eccentric buildings rarely matched elsewhere in England including the Saxon Church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin, Sompting, Castle Goring, which has a front and rear of entirely different styles and Brighton's Indo-Saracenic Royal Pavilion.\nDialect.\nHistorically, Sussex has had its own dialect with regional differences reflecting its cultural history. It has been divided into variants for the three western rapes of West Sussex, the two eastern rapes of Lewes and Pevensey and an area approximate to the easternmost rape of Hastings. The Sussex dialect is also notable in having an unusually large number of words for mud, in a way similar to the popular belief which exists that the Inuit have an unusually large number of words for snow.\nLiterature.\nWriters born in Sussex include the Renaissance poet Thomas May and playwrights Thomas Otway, and John Fletcher. One of the most prolific playwrights of his day, Fletcher is thought to have collaborated with Shakespeare. Notable Sussex poets include William Collins, William Hayley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Richard Realf, Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, Edward Carpenter and John Scott. Other writers from Sussex include Sheila Kaye-Smith, Noel Streatfeild, Patrick Hamilton, Rumer Godden, Hammond Innes, Angus Wilson, Maureen Duffy, Angela Carter, William Nicholson, Peter James, Kate Mosse and Alex Preston.\nIn addition there are writers, who while they were not born in Sussex had a strong connection. This includes Charlotte Turner Smith, William Blake, Alfred Tennyson, H. G. Wells, Hilaire Belloc, John Cowper Powys, Arthur Conan Doyle, Henry James, E. F. Benson, John Roman Baker, James Herbert and AA Milne, who lived in Ashdown Forest for much of his life and set his Winnie-the-Pooh stories in the forest. Sussex has been home to four winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature: Rudyard Kipling spent much of his life in Sussex, living in Rottingdean and later at Burwash. Irishman W. B. Yeats spent three winters living with American poet Ezra Pound at Colemans Hatch in the Ashdown Forest and towards the end of his life spent much time at Steyning and Withyham; John Galsworthy spent much of his life in Bury in the Sussex Downs; and Harold Pinter lived in Worthing in the 1960s.\nMusic.\nSussex's rich musical heritage encompasses folk, classical and popular genres amongst others. Composed by William Ward-Higgs, \"Sussex by the Sea\" is the county's unofficial anthem. Passed on through oral tradition, many of Sussex's traditional songs may not have changed significantly for centuries, with their origins perhaps dating as far back as the time of the South Saxons. William Henry Hudson compared the singing of the Sussexians with that of the Basques and the Tehuelche people of Patagonia, both peoples with ancient cultures. The songs sung by the Copper Family, Henry Burstow, Samuel Willett, Peter and Harriett Verrall, David Penfold and others were collected by John Broadwood and his niece Lucy Broadwood, Kate Lee and composers Ralph Vaughan Williams and George Butterworth. Sussex also played a major part in the folk music revival of the 1960s and 1970s with various singers including George 'Pop' Maynard, Scan Tester, Tony Wales and the sisters\nDolly and Shirley Collins.\nSussex has also been home to many composers of classical music including Thomas Weelkes, John Ireland, Edward Elgar, Frank Bridge, Sir Hubert Parry and Ralph Vaughan Williams, who played a major part in recording Sussex's traditional music. While Glyndebourne is one of the world's best known opera houses, the county is home to professional orchestras the Brighton Philharmonic Orchestra and the Worthing Symphony Orchestra.\nIn popular music, Sussex has produced artists including Leo Sayer, The Cure, The Levellers, Brett Anderson, Keane, The Kooks, The Feeling, Rizzle Kicks, Conor Maynard, Tom Odell, Royal Blood, Rag'n'Bone Man, Celeste, Architects and Maisie Peters. In the 1970s, Sussex was home to Phun City, the UK's first large-scale free music festival and hosted the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest which propelled ABBA to worldwide fame. Major festivals include The Great Escape Festival and Glyndebourne Festival Opera.\nTelevision.\nDue to the size of the county, it is covered by more than one TV station:\nReligion.\nChristianity is the predominant religion in Sussex with 57.8 per cent of the population identifying as Christian in the 2011 census. Other results from the 2011 census are: 1.4 per cent as Muslim, 0.7 per cent as Hindu and 30.5 per cent as having no religion.\nSussex has been a single diocese of the established church since the eighth century, after St Wilfrid founded Selsey Abbey on land granted by King \u00c6\u00f0elwealh, Sussex's first Christian king. The Normans moved the location of Sussex's cathedral to Chichester in 1075. Since 1965 Arundel Cathedral has been the seat of the Roman Catholic Bishops of Arundel and Brighton, which covers Sussex and Surrey. The established church and the Catholic Church were historically strongest in western and southern areas. In contrast, Protestant non-conformity was historically strongest in areas furthest from diocesan authorities in Chichester, in the south-west. This included in the Weald and in the east, where there were also links to Protestant northern Europe. St Richard of Chichester is Sussex's patron saint.\nAccording to the 2011 census there were about 23,000 Muslims in Sussex, constituting 1.4 per cent of the population. Within Sussex, Crawley had the highest proportion of Muslims with 7.2 per cent of the population.\nJewish people have been recorded as living in Sussex since the 12th century and are first mentioned in 1179/80 pipe roll for Chichester. A considerable Jewish community existed in Chichester by 1186. All Sussex's Jews would have been expelled in 1290 when Edward I of England issued the Edict of Expulsion. A Jewish population had returned to Sussex by the late 18th century in Brighton and Arundel.\nA wide variety of non-traditional religious and belief groups have bases in and around East Grinstead. Groups include the Church of Scientology at Saint Hill Manor, Opus Dei, the Rosicrucian Order, the Pagan Federation and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the Mormons).\nScience.\nPell's equation and the Pell number are both named after 17th century mathematician John Pell. Pell is sometimes credited with inventing the division sign, \u00f7, which has also been attributed to Swiss mathematician Johann Heinrich Rahn, one of his students. In the 19th century, geologist and palaeontologist Gideon Mantell began the scientific study of dinosaurs. In 1822 he was responsible for the discovery and eventual identification of the first fossil teeth, and later much of the skeleton of Iguanodon. Braxton Hicks contractions are named after John Braxton Hicks, the Sussex doctor who in 1872 first described the uterine contractions not resulting in childbirth.\nIn the 20th century, Frederick Soddy won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on radioactive substances, and his investigations into the origin and nature of isotopes. Frederick Gowland Hopkins shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1929 with Christiaan Eijkman, for discovering the growth-stimulating vitamins. Martin Ryle shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1974 with Cornishman Antony Hewish, the first Nobel prize awarded in recognition of astronomical research. While working at the University of Sussex, Harold Kroto won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Richard Smalley and Robert Curl from Rice University in the US for the discovery of fullerenes. David Mumford is a mathematician known for distinguished work in algebraic geometry and then for research into vision and pattern theory. He won the International Mathematical Union's Fields Medal in 1974 and in 2010 was awarded the United States National Medal of Science.\nIn the social sciences, Sussex was home to economist John Maynard Keynes from 1925 to 1946. The founding father of Keynesian economics, he is widely considered to be one of the founders of modern macroeconomics and the most influential economist of the 20th century. David Pilbeam won the 1986 International Prize from the Fyssen Foundation.\nIn the early 20th century, Sussex was at the centre of one of what has been described as 'British archaeology's greatest hoax'. Bone fragments said to have been collected in 1912 were presented as the fossilised remains of a previously unknown early human, referred to as Piltdown Man. In 1953 the bone fragments were exposed as a forgery, consisting of the lower jawbone of an orangutan deliberately combined with the skull of a fully developed modern human. From 1967 to 1979, Sussex was home to the Isaac Newton Telescope at the Royal Greenwich Observatory in Herstmonceux Castle.\nSport.\nSussex has a centuries-long tradition of sport. Sussex has played a key role in the early development of both cricket and stoolball. Cricket is recognised as having been formed in the Weald and Sussex is where cricket was first recorded as being played by men (in 1611), and by women (in 1677), as well as being the location of the first reference to a cricket bat (in 1622) and a wicket (in 1680). Founded in 1839, Sussex CCC is England's oldest county cricket club and is the oldest professional sports club in the world. Slindon Cricket Club dominated the sport for a while in the 18th century. The cricket ground at Arundel Castle traditionally plays host to a Duke of Norfolk's XI which plays the national test sides touring England. Founded in 1971, the Sussex Cricket League is believed to be the largest adult cricket league in the world, with 335 teams in 2018. Referred to as Sussex's 'national' sport and a Sussex game or pastime, Sussex may be where the sport of stoolball originated and is where the sport was formalised in the 19th century and its revival took place in the early 20th century.\nSussex is represented in the Premier League by Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and in the Football League by Crawley Town. Brighton has been a League member since 1920, whereas Crawley was promoted to the League in 2011. Brighton &amp; Hove Albion play in the FA Women's Super League and Lewes play in the FA Women's Championship. Sussex has had its own football association, since 1882 and its own football league, which has since expanded into Surrey, since 1920. In horse racing, Sussex is home to Goodwood, Fontwell Park, Brighton and Plumpton. The All England Jumping Course show jumping facility hosts the British Jumping Derby and the Royal International Horse Show. Eastbourne Eagles speedway team race in the SGB Championship.\nCuisine.\nThe historic county is known for its \"seven good things of Sussex\". These seven things are Pulborough eel, Selsey cockle, Chichester lobster, Rye herring, Arundel mullet, Amberley trout and Bourne wheatear. Sussex is also known for Ashdown Partridge Pudding, Chiddingly Hot pot, Sussex Bacon Pudding, Sussex Hogs' Pudding, Huffed Chicken, Sussex Churdles, Sussex Shepherds Pie, Sussex Pond Pudding, Sussex Blanket Pudding, Sussex Well Pudding, and Chichester Pudding. Sussex is also known for its cakes and biscuits known as Sussex Plum Heavies and Sussex Lardy Johns, while banoffee pie was first created in 1972 in Jevington.\nThe county has vineyards and a long history of brewing of beer. It is home to the 18th century beer brewers, Harveys of Lewes as well as many more recently established breweries. There are also many cider makers in Sussex, Hunts Sussex Cider and SeaCider are the largest cider producers. With 138 vineyards in 2023, Sussex has a quarter of the UK's vineyards. In 2022, Sussex wine gained Protected Designation of Origin status following decades of international acclaim with Sussex wines winning awards around the world. Many vineyards make wines using traditional Champagne varieties and methods, and there are similarities between the topography and chalk and clay soils of Sussex downland and that of the Champagne region which lies on a latitude to the south.\nVisual arts.\nSome of the earliest known art in Sussex is the carvings in the galleries of the Neolithic flint mines at Cissbury on the South Downs near Worthing. From the Roman period, the palace at Fishbourne has the largest in situ collection of mosaics in the UK, while the villa at Bignor contains some of the best preserved Roman mosaics in England.\nDating from around the 12th century, the 'Lewes Group' of wall paintings can be found in several churches across the centre of Sussex, some of which are celebrated for their age, extent and quality. Of uncertain origin, the Long Man of Wilmington is Europe's largest representation of the human form.\nIn the late 18th century three men commissioned important works of the county which ensured that its landscapes and daily life were captured onto canvas. William Burrell of Knepp Castle commissioned Swiss-born watercolourist Samuel Hieronymus Grimm to tour Sussex, producing 900 watercolours of the county's buildings. George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont of Petworth House was a patron of painters such as J. M. W. Turner and John Constable. John 'Mad Jack' Fuller also commissioned Turner to make a series of paintings which resulted in thirteen finished watercolours of Fuller's house at Brightling and the area around it.\nIn the 19th century landscape watercolourist Copley Fielding lived in Sussex and illustrator Aubrey Beardsley and painter and sculptor Eric Gill were born in Brighton. Gill went on to found an art colony in Ditchling known as The Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic, which survived until 1989. The 1920s and 1930s saw the creation of some of the best-known works by Edward Burra who was known for his work of Sussex, Paris and Harlem and Eric Ravilious who is known for his paintings of the South Downs.\nIn the early 20th century Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, both members of the Bloomsbury Group, lived and worked at Charleston Farmhouse near Firle. Sussex also became a major centre for surrealism in the early 20th century. At West Dean, Edward James was patron to artists including Salvador Dal\u00ed and Ren\u00e9 Magritte while at Farley Farm House near Chiddingly the home of Roland Penrose and Lee Miller was frequented by artists such as Pablo Picasso, Man Ray, Henry Moore, Eileen Agar, Jean Dubuffet, Dorothea Tanning and Max Ernst. Both collections form one of the most important bodies of Surrealist art in Europe.\nFootnotes.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "49702", "revid": "9065236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49702", "title": "Kingdom of Sussex", "text": "Kingdom of Anglo-Saxon England\nThe Kingdom of the South Saxons, today referred to as the Kingdom of Sussex (; from , in turn from or , meaning \"(land or people of/Kingdom of) the South Saxons\"), was one of the seven traditional kingdoms of the Heptarchy of Anglo-Saxon England. On the south coast of the island of Great Britain, it was originally a sixth-century Saxon colony and later an independent kingdom.\n The kingdom remains one of the least known of the Anglo-Saxon polities, with no surviving king-list, several local rulers and less centralisation than other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The South Saxons were ruled by the kings of Sussex until the country was annexed by Wessex, probably in 827, in the aftermath of the Battle of Ellendun. In 860 Sussex was ruled by the kings of Wessex, and by 927 all remaining Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were ruled by them as part of the new kingdom of England.\nThe foundation legend of the kingdom of Sussex is that in 477 \u00c6lle and his three sons arrived in three ships, conquering what is now Sussex. \u00c6lle became overlord, or \"Bretwalda\", over the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms south of the Humber. Historians are divided over whether or not \u00c6lle really existed; however archaeological evidence supports the view that a short-lived expansion of South Saxon authority as far as the Midlands may have taken place in the 5th century.\nFor much of the 7th and 8th centuries, Sussex suffered invasion attempts by the kingdom of Wessex to its west. King \u00c6\u00f0elwealh formed an alliance with Christian Mercia against Wessex, becoming Sussex's first Christian king. With support from St Wilfrid, Sussex became the last major Anglo-Saxon kingdom to become Christian. South Saxon and Mercian forces took control of what are now east Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. C\u00e6dwalla of Wessex killed \u00c6\u00f0elwealh and \"ravaged Sussex by fierce slaughter and devastation\". The South Saxons forced C\u00e6dwalla from Sussex and were able to lead a campaign into Kent, replacing its king. At that time Sussex could have re-emerged into a regional power. Shortly afterwards, C\u00e6dwalla returned to Sussex, killing its king and putting its people into what Bede called \"a worse state of slavery\". The South Saxon clergy were put under the control of West Saxon Winchester. Only around 715 was Eadberht of Selsey made the first bishop of the South Saxons, after which further invasion attempts from Wessex ensued.\nFollowing a period of rule by King Offa of Mercia, Sussex regained its independence but was annexed by Wessex around 827 and was fully absorbed into the kingdom of Wessex in 860.\nGeography.\nThe Kingdom of Sussex had its initial focus in a territory based on the former kingdom and Romano-British \"civitas\" of the \"Regni\" and its boundaries coincided in general with those of the later county of Sussex. For a brief period in the 7th century, the Kingdom of Sussex controlled the Isle of Wight and the territory of the \"Meonwara\" in the Meon Valley in east Hampshire. From the late 8th century, Sussex seems to have absorbed the Kingdom of the \"Haestingas\", after the region was conquered by the Mercian king Offa.\nA large part of its territory was covered by the forest that took its name from the fort of \"Anderitum\" at modern Pevensey, and known to the Romano-British as the Forest of Andred and to the Saxons as or , known today as the Weald. This forest, according to the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", was wide and deep (although probably closer to wide). It was the largest remaining area of woodland and heath in the territories that became England and was inhabited by wolves, boars and possibly bears. It was so dense that \"Domesday Book\" did not record some of its settlements. The heavily forested Weald made expansion difficult but also provided some protection from invasion by neighbouring kingdoms. While Sussex's isolation from the rest of Anglo-Saxon England has been emphasised, Roman roads must have remained important communication arteries across the forest of the Weald. The Weald was not the only area of Sussex that was forested in Saxon times\u2014for example, at the western end of Sussex is the Manhood Peninsula, which in the modern era is largely deforested, but the name is probably derived from the Old English meaning \"men's wood\" or \"common wood\" indicating that it was once woodland.\nThe coastline would have looked different from today. Much of the alluvium in the river plains had not yet been deposited and the tidal river estuaries extended much further inland. It is estimated that the coastal plain may have been at least one mile broader than it is today. Before people reclaimed the tidal marshes in the 13th century the coastal plain contained extensive areas of sea water in the form of lagoons, salt marsh, wide inlets, islands and peninsulas. To the South Saxons of the 5th and 6th centuries this coastline must have resembled their original homeland between coastal Friesland, Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein.\nThe landscape gave rise to some key regional differences within the kingdom. The rich coastal plain continued to be the base for the large estates, ruled by their thegns, some of whom had their boundaries confirmed by charters. The Downs were more deserted. South Saxon impact was greatest in the Weald. Along the north scarp of the Downs runs a series of parishes with land evenly distributed across the different soils to their northern boundaries; the parishes were more or less equal in area, around . In the early mediaeval period, the rivers of Sussex may have acted locally as a major unifier, linking coastal, estuary and riverside communities and providing people in these areas with a sense of identity.\nThe boundaries of the Kingdom of Sussex probably crystallised around the 6th and 7th centuries. The Domesday Book lists four Mardens on the East Hampshire/ West Sussex border. The Old English for Marden would have been meaning \"boundary down\", reflecting their position. A tributary of the River Ems rises south of Stoughton and travels north to North Marden, completing the western boundary of the South Saxons. Bede described the western boundary with the Kingdom of Wessex as being opposite the Isle of Wight. To the east at Romney Marsh and the River Limen (now called the River Rother or Kent Ditch), Sussex shared a border with the Kingdom of Kent. North of the Forest Ridge in the Wealden forest lay the sub-kingdom of Surrey, which became a frontier area disputed by various kingdoms until it later became part of Wessex. To the south of Sussex lay the English Channel, beyond which lay Francia, or the Kingdom of the Franks.\nBy the 680s, when Christianity was being introduced, there is no doubt that the district around Selsey and Chichester had become the political centre of the kingdom, though there is little archaeological evidence for a reoccupation of Chichester itself before the 9th century. Ditchling may have been an important regional centre for a large part of central Sussex between the Rivers Adur and Ouse until the founding of Lewes in the 9th century. By the 11th century the towns were mostly developments of the fortified towns () founded in the reign of Alfred the Great.\nThe ancient droveways of Sussex linked coastal and downland communities in the south with summer pasture land in the interior of the Weald. The droveways were used throughout the Saxon era by the South Saxons and probably originated before the Roman occupation of Britain. The droveways formed a road system that clearly suggests that the settlers in the oldest developed parts of Sussex were concerned not so much with east\u2013west connections between neighbouring settlements as with north\u2013south communication between each settlement and its outlying woodland pasture. The droving roads had an enduring effect on the pattern of Sussex settlement. When churches came to be built, an ideal site was where a drove crossed a river. Eventually traders gravitated to churches, founding villages, and in some cases market towns such as Ditchling, Shermanbury, Thakeham, Ashurst and Shipley. Different names existed for the swine pastures in different parts of Sussex. In the territory of the in the east, swine pastures were named , in the centre they were referred to as \"styes\" () and in the west, . These places grew from being sheds for animals and temporary huts for swineherders, to permanent farms, water-mills, churches and market towns. Churches in the High Weald are mostly on isolated ridge-top sites, away from the pioneer farms being established on the valley sides, as at Worth and Itchingfield to this day.\nLand divisions in the Kingdom of Sussex were sometimes different from other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and regions. By the Late Saxon period, the main administrative unit of Sussex was the district known as the rape. Their origins may be earlier, possibly originating in the Romano-British period. The rapes were sub-divided into hundreds, which served as taxation and administrative districts. In England generally these contained a nominal 100 hides (a measure of taxable value linked to land area) but in Sussex they were generally much smaller. Sussex may also have had eight virgates for every hide; in most of England a hide was usually made up of four virgates.\nPopulation.\nThe population of Britain as a whole is likely to have declined sharply around the 4th century from around 2\u20134 million in AD\u00a0200 to less than 1 million in AD\u00a0300. There would have been a similarly sharp decline in the population of Sussex during this period. At the end of the 4th century there was a decline in the birth rate across Roman Britain; this population decrease would have been exacerbated by the transfer to Continental Europe of three large armies, recruited in Britain in the last 30 years of Roman rule, as well as plague and barbarian attack. Sussex's population around 450 is estimated to have been no more than about 25,000, rising gradually to around 35,000 by 1100. At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, Sussex had some of the highest population densities in England.\nApproximate populations of Sussex towns shortly after the end of the Saxon period in 1086 at the time of the Domesday Book may have been as follows:\nHistory.\nFoundation story.\nThe account of \u00c6lle and his three sons landing at appears in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", a collection of seven vernacular manuscripts, commissioned in the 9th century, some 400 years or more after the events at .\nThe account describes how on landing \u00c6lle slew the local defenders and drove the remainder into the Forest of Andred. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle goes on to describe \u00c6lle's battle with the British in 485 near the bank of \"Mercredesburne\", and his siege of the Saxon Shore fort at \"Andredadsceaster\" (modern day Pevensey) in 491 after which the inhabitants were massacred.\nThe legendary foundation of Saxon Sussex, by \u00c6lle, is likely to have originated in an oral tradition before being recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. According to legend, various places took their names from \u00c6lle's sons. Cissa is supposed to have given his name to Chichester, Cymen to \"Cymenshore\" and Wlencing to Lancing. is traditionally thought to have been located at what is now known as the Owers Rocks, south of Selsey, however there is no archaeological evidence to support the existence of \u00c6lle and his three sons in the Selsey area.\nFrom 491 until the arrival of Christianity in the 7th century, there was a dearth of contemporary written material.Because of the lack of written history before the 7th century it has made it difficult for historians to produce a definitive story. The preservation of \u00c6lle's sons in Old English place names is unusual. The names of the founders, in other origin legends, seem to have British and/ or Latin roots not Old English. It is likely that the foundation stories were known before the 9th century, but the annalists manipulated them to provide a common origin for the new regime. These myths proport that the British were defeated and replaced by invading Anglo-Saxons arriving in small ships. These origin stories were largely believed right up to the 19th century.\nEarly period (c.\u2009450\u00a0\u2013 600).\nArchaeology gives a different settlement picture to that indicated by the South Saxon foundation story. Germanic tribes probably first arrived in Sussex earlier in the 5th century than 477. The archaeological evidence that we do have indicates the area of settlement by the location of cemeteries of the period. The origins of the settlers can be derived by comparing the design of grave goods and pottery with the designs of similar items in the German homelands. The principal area of settlement in the 5th century has been identified as between the lower Ouse and Cuckmere rivers in East Sussex, based on the number of Anglo-Saxon cemeteries there. However, there are two cemeteries in West Sussex at Highdown, near Worthing and Apple Down, 11\u00a0km (7\u00a0mi.) northwest of Chichester. The area between the Ouse and Cuckmere was believed to have been the location for the federate treaty settlement of Anglo-Saxon mercenaries. Whatever the original settlement pattern of the early Germanic settlers, their culture came to rapidly dominate the whole of Sussex.\nThere is some evidence to support the treaty hypothesis, based on the grave finds of the period. For example, the excavation of one of the cemeteries, at Rookery Hill at Bishopstone, East Sussex, yielded late Roman or insular Roman metalwork including a Quoit Brooch Style buckle, which would indicate settlement here to the early 5th century.\nSubsequent excavations revealed a considerable area of Saxon buildings. Of the 22 buildings excavated, three were sunken huts, 17 are rectangular founded on individual post holes, one is represented by post holes between which are beam slots, and one by eight single large posts.\nHighdown is the only 5th-century Saxon cemetery found outside the Ouse/Cuckmere area, and is 2\u00a0km from a hoard of Roman gold and silver that was found in 1997. The Patching hoard, as it came to be known, contained a coin as recent as 470. Thus, Highdown cemetery would have been in use by Saxons when the hoard was buried at Patching. The settlement that used Highdown as a burial ground in the 5th century has never been identified, but White speculates that there may have been some link between Patching and Highdown, and Welch has suggested that a Romano-British community was based there and that they controlled a group of Saxon mercenaries.\nDespite the difficulties presented by the large forest tract of the Weald that separated Sussex from Surrey, similarities in the archaeological record from this period between Sussex and Surrey help to substantiate the claim of \u00c6lle of Sussex to be the first \"Bretwalda\" in the Thames Valley. Such unified regional commands were probably not long-lasting. J. N. L. Myres posits that archaeological evidence, in the form of distinctive Saxon saucer brooches, suggests that \u00c6lle's forces penetrated north as far as modern day Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire to the west. H. R. Loyn suggests that this initial regional hegemony may have ended after the Battle of Mount Badon.\nChristianisation and loss of independence (600\u2013860).\nAfter 491 the written history of Sussex goes blank until 607, when the annals report that Ceolwulf of Wessex fought against the South Saxons. Threatened by Wessex, the South Saxons sought to secure their independence by alliance with Mercia. To the South Saxons, the more distant influence and control of a king from Mercia is likely to have been preferable to that of the West Saxons. The alliance between Mercia and the South Saxons was further sealed by \u00c6\u00f0elwealh, king of Sussex, receiving baptism into the Christian church through the Mercian court, with Wulfhere acting as his sponsor, making \u00c6\u00f0elwealh Sussex's first Christian king. Wulfhere gave \u00c6\u00f0elwealh the Isle of Wight and the territory of the \"Meonwara\" (the Meon valley of present-day Hampshire). \u00c6\u00f0elwealh also married Eabe, a princess of the \"Hwicce\", a Mercian satellite province.\nIn 681, the exiled St Wilfrid of Northumbria arrived in the kingdom of the South Saxons and remained there for five years evangelising and baptising the people. There had been a famine in the land of the South Saxons when Wilfrid arrived. Wilfrid taught the locals to fish, and they were impressed with Wilfrid's teachings and agreed to be baptised \"en masse\". On the day of the baptisms the rain fell on the \"thirsty earth\", so ending the famine. \u00c6\u00f0elwealh gave 87 hides (an area of land) and a royal vill to Wilfrid to enable him to found Selsey Abbey. The abbey eventually became the seat of the South Saxon bishopric, where it remained until after the Norman Conquest, when it was moved to Chichester by decree of the Council of London of 1075.\nShortly after the arrival of St Wilfrid, the kingdom was ravaged with \"fierce slaughter and devastation\" and \u00c6\u00f0elwealh was slain by an exiled West Saxon prince C\u00e6dwalla. The latter was eventually expelled, by \u00c6\u00f0elwealh's successors, two Ealdormen named Berhthun and Andhun. In 686 the South Saxons attacked Hlothhere, king of Kent, in support of his nephew Eadric, who afterwards became king of Kent. At this time, a new South Saxon hegemony extending from the Isle of Wight into Kent could conceivably have seen Sussex re-emerge as a regional power but the revival of Wessex ended this possibility. Eadric's rule in Kent lasted until Kent was invaded by C\u00e6dwalla who had managed to establish himself as ruler of Wessex. With his additional resources, C\u00e6dwalla once more invaded Sussex, killing Berhthun. Sussex now became for some years subject to a period of harsh West Saxon domination. According to Bede, the subjection reduced the kingdom of Sussex to \"a worse state of slavery\"; it also included placing the South Saxon clergy under the authority of Wessex through the bishops of Winchester. C\u00e6dwalla also seized the Isle of Wight where he ruthlessly exterminated its population, including its royal line. According to David Dumville, C\u00e6dwalla's savage behaviour towards Sussex and the Isle of Wight can be explained by Sussex's westward expansion with assistance from Mercia at the expense of Wessex and C\u00e6dwalla was determined that this should never happen again.\nOf the later South Saxon kings we have little knowledge except from occasional charters. In 692 a grant is made by a king called No\u00f0helm (or \"Nunna\") to his sister, which is witnessed by another king called Watt. There is a theory that Watt may have been a sub-king who ruled over a tribe of people centred around modern day Hastings, known as the \"Haestingas\" and Nunna is described, in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", as the kinsman of Ine of Wessex who fought with him against Geraint, King of the Britons, in 710. According to Bede, Sussex was subject to Ine for a number of years and like C\u00e6dwalla, Ine also oppressed the people of Sussex in the same harsh way for many years.\nIn 710 Sussex was still under West Saxon domination when King Nothhelm of Sussex is recorded as having campaigned with Ine in the west against Dumnonia. Sussex evidently broke away from West Saxon domination some time before 722 when Ine is recorded as invading Sussex, which he repeated three years later, killing a West Saxon exile named Ealdberht who had fled to the Weald of Sussex and Surrey and appears to have attempted to find support in Sussex. The \"Anglo Saxon Chronicle\" records a further campaign against the South Saxons by the West Saxons in 725.\nAccording to a charter dated 775, the former abbot of Selsey, Bishop Eadberht of Selsey (c.\u2009705 x?709)\u00a0\u2013 (716 x?), was given a grant of land by King Nunna; the document included King Watt as a witness. However, the charter is now believed to have been a 10th- or early-11th-century forgery.\nThere is another charter, that is thought to be genuine, that records a series of transactions of a piece of land near modern-day Burpham in the Arun Valley.\nIt starts off with a grant of land, at Peppering, by Nunna to Berhfrith probably for the foundation of a minster.\nBerhfrith transferred the land to Eolla, who in turn sold it to Wulfhere. The land then went to Beoba who passed it on to Beorra and Ecca. Finally King Osmund bought the land from his comes Erra and granted it to a religious woman known as Tidburgh. The charter is undated but it has been possible to date the various transactions approximately, by cross referencing people who appear both on this charter and on other charters that \"do\" provide dates. On the transaction, where Eolla has acquired the land from Berhfrith and sells it to Wulfhere [c.\u2009705 x (716x?)], Nunna's subscription is followed by a certain Osric who was possibly Nunna's co-ruler. The other witnesses who followed Osric were Eadberht and Eolla, both who can be identified as ecclesiastics.\nNunna's last surviving charter, which is dated 714 in error for 717, is witnessed by a King \u00c6\u00f0elstan.\nA little later, \u00c6\u00f0elberht was King of Sussex, but he is known only from charters. The dates of \u00c6\u00f0elberht's reign are unknown beyond the fact that he was a contemporary of Sigeferth, Bishop of Selsey from 733, as Sigeferth witnessed an undated charter of \u00c6\u00f0elberht in which \u00c6\u00f0elberht is styled Ethelbertus rex Sussaxonum.\nAfter this we hear nothing more until about 765, when a grant of land is made by a king named Ealdwulf, with two other kings, \u00c6lfwald and Oslac, as witnesses.\nIn 765 and 770 grants are made by a King Osmund, the latter one was later confirmed by Offa of Mercia.\nThe independent existence of the Kingdom of Sussex came to an end in the early 770s. In 771, King Offa of Mercia conquered the territory of the \"Haestingas\"; he may have entered Sussex from the Kingdom of Kent, where he was already dominant. By 772 he apparently controlled the whole of the Kingdom of Sussex. Offa also confirmed two charters of \u00c6\u00f0elberht, and in 772 he grants land himself in Sussex, with Oswald, \"dux Su\u00f0sax\", as a witness. It is probable that about this time Offa annexed the kingdom of Sussex, as several persons, Osmund, \u00c6lfwald and Oslac, who had previously used the royal title, now sign with that of \"dux\".\nOffa may not have been able to maintain control in the period 776\u2013785 but he appears to have re-established control afterwards. Mercian power collapsed in the years following Offa's death in 796, and the South Saxons re-emerged as an independent political entity.\nAfter the Battle of Ellandun in 825 the South Saxons submitted to Ecgberht of Wessex, and from this time they remained subject to the West Saxon dynasty. According to Heather Edwards in the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\", it is probable that Sussex was not annexed by Wessex until 827. The earldom of Sussex seems later to have been sometimes combined with that of Kent. \u00c6thelberht of Wessex was ruling Sussex and the other south-eastern kingdoms by 855, and succeeded to the kingship of Wessex on the death of his brother, King \u00c6thelbald, thus bringing Sussex fully under the crown of Wessex.\nEaldormanry and shire (860\u20131066).\nFrom 895 Sussex suffered from constant raids by the Danes, until the accession of Canute, after which arose the two great forces of the house of Godwine and of the Normans. Godwine was probably a native of Sussex, and by the end of Edward the Confessor's reign a third part of the county was in the hands of his family.\nThe death of Eadwine, Ealdorman of Sussex, is recorded in 982, because he was buried at Abingdon Abbey in Berkshire, where one version of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" was compiled. According to the abbey's records, in which he was called (Eadwine leader of the South Saxons), he bequeathed estates to them in his will, although the document itself has not survived. Earlier in the same year he witnessed a charter of King Ethelred the Unready as . His name was also added to a forged charter dated 956 (possibly an error for 976).\nIn the next generation, Wulfnoth Cild, a Sussex thegn, played a prominent part in English politics. In 1009 his actions resulted in the destruction of the English fleet, and by 1011 Sussex, together with most of South East England, was in the hands of the Danes. In an early example of local government reform, the Anglo-Saxon ealdormanries were abolished by the Danish kings and replaced with a smaller number of larger earldoms. Wulfnoth Cild was the father of Godwin, who was made Earl of Wessex in 1020. His earldom included Sussex. When he died in 1053, Godwin was succeeded as Earl of Wessex (including Sussex) by his son Harold, who had previously been Earl of East Anglia.\nEdward the Confessor, who had spent much of his early life in exile in Normandy, was pro-Norman and in Sussex gave to the abbot of F\u00e9camp Abbey the minster church at Steyning, as well as confirming land existing land grants at Hastings, Rye and Winchelsea. To his chaplain, Osborn, later William's Bishop of Exeter, Edward gave the harbour and other land at Bosham. Many of the Saxon nobles grew jealous and from 1049 there was conflict between the disgruntled Saxon nobility, the king and the incoming Normans. Godwine and his second son Harold kept the peace off the Sussex coast by using Bosham and Pevensey to drive away pirates. In 1049 the murder by Sweyn Godwinson of his cousin Beorn after Beorn has been tricked in going to Bosham resulted in the entire Godwine family being banished. It was from Bosham in 1051 that Godwin, Sweyn and Tostig fled to Bruges and the court of Baldwin V, Count of Flanders, a relative of Tostig's wife, Judith of Flanders. When they returned in 1052 to an enthusiastic welcome in the Sussex ports, Edward had to reinstate the Godwine family.\nIn 1064 Harold sailed from Bosham, from where a storm cast him up in Normandy. Here he was apparently tricked into pledging his support for William of Normandy as the next king of England. On 14 October 1066, Harold II, the last Saxon king of England was killed at the Battle of Hastings and the English army defeated, by William the Conqueror and his army. It is likely that all the fighting men of Sussex were at the battle, as the county's thegns were decimated and any that survived had their lands confiscated. At least 353 of the 387 manors, in the county, were taken from their Saxon owners and given to the victorious Normans by the Conqueror, and Saxon power in Sussex was at an end.\nLife and society.\nDefence and warfare.\nThe earliest recorded Viking raid on Sussex took place in 895 and it was particularly difficult for a scattered farming community to meet these sudden attacks. In 895 the population of Chichester killed many hundreds of Danes who plundered the area. Eadulf, a Saxon noble, was appointed to organise the defence of Sussex but died from the plague before much could be done.\nAlfred the Great almost certainly inaugurated the building of a series of or forts to be garrisoned at the threat of danger by men drawn from the surrounding population. The development of the burhs across the southern half of England suggests a considerable awareness of a repeated problem The Burghal Hidage documents five such fortifications in Sussex\u00a0\u2014 at Chichester, Burpham, Lewes, Hastings and \"Eorpeburnan\".\nIn the reign of \u00c6thelred the Unready, the threat of the Danes continued\u00a0\u2014 in 994 and 1000 the \"Anglo Saxon Chronicle\" records burning, plundering and manslaughter on the coast of Sussex and neighbouring counties. The most serious attacks took place in 1009, when a Viking army took up position over the winter period on the Isle of Wight and ravaged Sussex, Hampshire and Berkshire.\nThe rectilinear street plan of Chichester is typical of the towns which developed from the fortified , which had intramural streets running around the town walls; this allowed garrison troops to defend the town and large peripheral blocks that were left as hedged areas () into which fugitives from the countryside could flee.\nEconomy.\nDeposited around c.\u2009470 as the kingdom of Sussex was being established, the Patching hoard of coins represents the earliest early mediaeval coins found in Britain. The hoard includes five imported \"siliquae\" that had not been clipped, so coin-clipping had probably ceased by then, although the coinage had probably collapsed decades earlier than this, after Roman rule in Britain collapsed.\nIn the first quarter of the 8th century the Kingdom of Sussex was among the kingdoms producing coinage, possibly from a mint near Selsey where the finds of coins termed Series G \"sceattas\" are concentrated. That a cash economy had returned by the 10th century is suggested by the various mints which became increasingly plentiful after King \u00c6thelstan reorganised England's coinage. There were mints at Chichester, Lewes and Steyning. A new mint also seems to have existed on a temporary basis in the Iron Age hillfort at Cissbury, which may have been refortified as a refuge during the Danish invasions in the reign of \u00c6thelred the Unready. The Cissbury mint seems to have worked in close association with the mint at Chichester rather than replacing it. By the eve of the Norman conquest, there were further mints at Arundel, Pevensey and Hastings.\nLewes seems to have prospered with overseas trade; coins from Lewes stamped \"LAE URB\" travelled as far as Rome. The substantial sea-faring trade of Lewes is indicated by the payment of 20 shillings for munitions of war payable whenever Edward the Confessor's fleet put to sea. This is the probable origin of the Cinque Ports organisation that flourished under the Normans. The River Ouse would have been navigable at least as far north as Lewes. Armstrong argues that while Sussex was separated from much else of mainstream English experience, this should not hide the rich trade that Sussex had with other parts of Europe. By the 1060s Lewes also supported a cattle market.\nBy the end of the Anglo Saxon period and the Domesday Survey by the Normans in 1086, Sussex contained some of the richest and most heavily populated pockets of England on the coastal plain, albeit alongside some of England's most economically underdeveloped areas in the Weald. By this time, Sussex had a network of urban centres such that farmers were within 15\u00a0km to 30\u00a0km of market facilities.\nAgriculture seems to have flourished on the Sussex coastal plain and on the Sussex Downs. The fact that the Sussex coast appears to have been relatively densely settled for centuries implies that the land was being more competently farmed than was typical of the standard of the day. The Weald was pig-fattening and cattle-grazing country. Drovers would divide their year between their \"winter house\" in their parent village outside the Weald and their \"summer house\" in the outlying woodland pasture up to away. Surviving features include a close network of former droveways and surviving fragments of wood pasture, such as the Mens and Ebernoe Common near Petworth.\nThe Domesday Book records that by the 11th century, the unknown Rameslie in Sussex had 100 salt pans to extract salt from sea water. Fisheries were also important to the economy of Sussex. Lewes was an important centre of a herring industry and had to pay a rent of 38,500 herrings for its sea fisheries.\nCapital.\nAt the time of the South Saxons it is unlikely that they would have had a capital in Sussex. The archaeologist Martin Biddle said that \"the evidence we have for the residences and itineraries of English kings before the Norman conquest is all too thin\" and according to Frank Stenton \"In the eleventh century the conception of a capital city had not yet taken a definite shape anywhere in the west. The centre of government in England was the kings' mobile court. The king was free to hold a council at any point in his realm..\" In Roman times Chichester was known as Noviomagus Reginorum and served as the capital of the \"Civitas Reginorum\", a client kingdom ruled by Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus. After the departure of the Romans, Noviomagus appears to have been largely abandoned with the earliest Saxon find, by archaeological excavation, being a small amount of mid-Saxon pottery dated around 8th-9th century.\nBefore Saxon occupation of Chichester, Sussex had been annexed, by the Kingdom of Wessex, in the middle of the 7th century.It was then ruled by Mercia and after regaining its independence, it was finally annexed and then absorbed, into Wessex, in 860.\nThe Anglo Saxon Chronicle suggests that Sussex was founded in the Selsey and Chichester area, however the archaeology does not support this. What the archaeology does show is that the initial settlement, of the South Saxons, was in the downland areas, between the River Ouse and River Cuckmere to the east of Sussex. From there the South Saxons migrated to the west of Sussex and by the 680s the area between Chichester and Selsey had become the political and ecclesiastical centre of the kingdom with the kings residence in \"Orreo Regis\" (Kingsham), south west of Chichester, and Wilfrid's religious centre in Selsey. According to Martin Welch \"After the Romans left there is no evidence for the reoccupation of Chichester till the 9th century\", when it was rebuilt and fortified as part of a programme of defence, instigated by Alfred the Great, of Wessex, to protect against Danish raids.\nKingship.\nThe South Saxon kingdom remains one of the most obscure of the Anglo-Saxon polities. A few names of South Saxon kings are recorded, and the history of the kingdom is sometimes illustrated by that of other areas, but information is otherwise limited. Sussex seems to have had a greater degree of decentralisation than other kingdoms. For a period during the 760s there may have been as many as four or five kings based within the territory, perhaps with each ruling over a distinct tribal territory, perhaps on a temporary basis. It seems possible that the people of the \"Haestingas\" may have had their own ruler for a while, and another sub-division may have been along the River Adur.\nComplex tiers of relationships between kings and kingdoms existed. For instance in the 7th century, when Wulfhere of Mercia was trying to increase his influence over the South Saxons, he ceded control of the provinces of the \"Meonwara\" and Wight to the South Saxon king \u00c6\u00f0elwealh. Wight at least had its own ruler, Arvald, who presumably recognised the authority of the South Saxon king, \u00c6\u00f0elwealh, and who in turn recognised the overlordship of the Mercian king, Wulfhere.\nThe Kingdom of Sussex was an independent unit until the reign of Offa of Mercia. Under Offa, who ruled over most of the kingdoms of the heptarchy, local South Saxon rulers were allowed to continue provided that they recognised Offa's overriding authority and some estates seem to have come into his direct possession.\nIn the 9th century, Sussex was ruled by the West Saxons. It would appear that the ultimate intention of \u00c6thelwulf of Wessex was for the kingdom of Wessex and the eastern regions of Sussex, Surrey, Kent and Essex to become separate kingdoms, with separate but related royal dynasties. It was only the early deaths of Aethelwulf's first two sons that allowed \u00c6thelbert of Wessex, his third son, to reunite Wessex and the eastern regions, including Sussex, into a single kingdom in 860. This occurred only after Athelberht had secured the consent of his younger brothers, Aethelred and Alfred. Though in part due to the careful cultivation of conquered regions, the establishment of an enduring \"Greater Wessex\" stretching along the southern coast owed much to chance, early deaths, and perhaps, to the growing recognition of the need for unity in the face of an increasing Viking threat. Sussex was never again treated as part of an eastern subkingdom but was not closely integrated with the old West Saxon provinces either. Sussex seems to have had its own ealdorman for much of the 10th century.\nRoyal tributes and dues were often collected at settlements known as king's tuns, often a separate place from where the royal hall of that the king would stay when in the area. Sussex has several places that are king's tuns including from west to east, Kingston by Ferring, Kingston by Sea, now part of Shoreham-by-Sea, and Kingston near Lewes. King's tuns in Anglo-Saxon England often acted as places of assembly, where the king could settle disputes or hear appeals. According to \u00c6thelstan, the first king of England, his grandmother \u00c6lfthryth had the use of an estate at \"\u00c6thelingadene\" (East and West Dean near Chichester). \u00c6lfthryth may have brought up her grandchildren, the sons of \u00c6thelred of Wessex, at \"\u00c6thelingadene\", which may have been one of the estates set aside for the benefit of the royal princes or \u00c6thelings.\nLaw.\nVarious folkmoots would have been held in Sussex, for instance at Ditchling, Tinhale (in Bersted) and Madehurst. Placename evidence for early assemblies in Sussex comes from Tinhale (from the Old English (thing) meaning hold a meeting, so \"meeting-hill\") and Madehurst (from the Old English meaning assembly, so \"assembly wooded hill\"). There is also a location in Durrington that had the name meaning a moot barrow or meeting barrow, a boundary barrow.\nThe early hundreds often lacked the formality of later attempts of local government: frequently they met in the open, at a convenient central spot, perhaps marked by a tree, as at Easebourne. Dill, meaning the boarded meeting place, was one of the few hundreds in Sussex that provided any accommodation. From the 10th century onwards the hundred became important as a court of justice as well as dealing with matters of local administration. The meeting place was often a point within the hundred such as a bridge (as in the bridge over the western River Rother in Rotherbridge hundred) or a notable tree (such as a tree called Tippa's Oak in Tipnoak hundred).\nIt is also recorded that an England-wide Royal Council () took place in Sussex on 3 April 930, when \u00c6thelstan, the first king of the English, and his councillors gathered at Lyminster by the River Arun. Another took place in Sussex in the reign of \u00c6thelstan (924-939), probably at Hamsey, on the River Ouse near Lewes.\nA small number of diplomas (documents affirming the grant or tenure of specified land) from Sussex survive from this period.\nBy the 1060s Lewes may have been Sussex's legal centre.\nReligion.\nAfter the departure of the Roman army, the Saxons arrived in Sussex in the 5th century and brought with them their polytheistic religion. The Saxon pagan culture probably caused a reversal of the spread of Christianity. Wilfrid's biographer records that in the year 666 Wilfrid's ship ran aground on the Sussex coast near Selsey where it was attacked and a pagan priest sought to cast magic spells from a high mound. Bede also refers to a mass suicide committed by groups of 40 or 50 men who jumped from cliffs during a time of famine. It is probable that these suicides represented sacrifices to appease the god Woden.\n\u00c6\u00f0elwealh became Sussex's first Christian king when he married Eafe, the daughter of Wulfhere, the Christian king of Mercia. In 681, Saint Wilfrid, the exiled Bishop of York, landed at Selsey and is credited with evangelising the local population and founding the church in Sussex. King \u00c6\u00f0elwealh granted land to Wilfrid which became the site of Selsey Abbey. According to Bede, it was the last area of the country to be converted. While Wilfrid is credited with the conversion of the Kingdom of Sussex to Christianity, it is unlikely that it was wholly heathen when he arrived. \u00c6\u00f0elwealh, Sussex's king, had been baptised. Damianus, a South Saxon, was made Bishop of Rochester in the Kingdom of Kent in the 650s and may indicate earlier missionary work in the first half of the 7th century. At the time of Wilfrid's mission there was a monastery at Bosham containing a few monks led by an Irish monk named Dicul, which was probably part of the Hiberno-Scottish mission of the time. Wilfrid was a champion of Roman customs and it was these customs that were adopted by the church in Sussex rather than the Celtic customs that had taken root in Scotland and Ireland.\nShortly after \u00c6\u00f0elwealh granted land to Wilfrid for the church, \u00c6\u00f0elwealh was killed by C\u00e6dwalla of Wessex, Sussex was conquered by C\u00e6dwalla and Christianity in Sussex was put under control of the diocese of Winchester. It was not until c.\u2009715 that Eadberht, Abbot of Selsey was consecrated the first bishop of the South Saxons.\nIn the late 7th or early 8th century, St. Cuthman, a shepherd who may have been born in Chidham and had been reduced to begging set out from his home with his disabled mother using a one-wheeled cart. When he reached Steyning he saw a vision and stopped there to build a church. Cuthman was venerated as a saint and his church was in existence by 857 when King \u00c6thelwulf of Wessex was buried there. Steyning was an important religious centre and St Cuthman's grave became a place of pilgrimage in the 10th and 11th centuries. According to the hagiography of the 11th century Secgan manuscript, another saint, St Cuthfl\u00e6d of Lyminster, is buried in or near to Lyminster Priory. In 681, Bede records that an outbreak of the plague had devastated parts of England, including Sussex and the monks at Selsey Abbey fasted and prayed for three days for an end to the outbreak. A young boy with the plague prayed to St Oswald and his prayers were answered, and a vision of St Peter and St Paul was said to have appeared to the boy, telling the boy that he would be the last to die.\nThe church built at Steyning was one of around 50 minster churches across Sussex and these churches supplied itinerant clergy to surrounding districts. Other examples include churches at Singleton, Lyminster, Findon and Bishopstone. The jurisdiction of each minster church in the pre-Viking era seems to match early land divisions that were replaced by hundreds in the 10th or 11th centuries. It was not until 200\u2013300 years after its conversion to Christianity in the 680s that a network of local parish churches existed in Sussex.\nSlavery.\nWilfrid's first act after he was given land at Selsey by King \u00c6\u00f0elwealh was to build a monastery to free 250 male and female slaves from slavery who were tied to the estate. These people were probably mainly of Romano-British descent. This is an indication of the very high percentage of slaves in England at this time. Fisher argues that slavery would have been the fate of many people of Romano-British descent at this time. By the 11th century it has been estimated that the proportion of slaves in Sussex was very low at around 4 per cent, some of the lowest rates in England; this compares with 25 per cent in Gloucestershire, 18 per cent in Hampshire and 10 per cent in Kent.\nCulture.\nThere is significant evidence for Frankish cultural influence on the kingdom of Sussex as well as the neighbouring kingdom of Kent; occasional references in Continental works suggest that Frankish kings may at one point have thought of the people of Sussex and other south eastern kingdoms as their political dependants.\nAccording to Gabor Thomas, there are clear cultural differences between how wealth and status were expressed in South Saxon society compared with Anglo Saxon kingdoms to the north. In the kingdom of Sussex and the neighbouring kingdom of Kent the range of ornamented dress accessories metalwork is significantly more austere and limited that in kingdoms to the north. However alternative status symbols were used fully in Sussex by those with higher status. Archaeological evidence shows that luxury food items were consumed in Sussex and exuberant architectural displays were constructed, such as a cellared tower excavated at Bishopstone.\nArt.\nFrom the beginning of the 6th century, Merovingian artefacts were present in Sussex, as they were in Kent and on the Isle of Wight, which is thought to reflect cross-Channel exchanges between Saxon Sussex and Merovingian Gaul. Assemblages such as have been found in Eastbourne show that Merovingian dress fashion had spread along the coastline of what is now Sussex, Kent and Hampshire and northern Gaul. Cemeteries at Alfriston, Highdown and Eastbourne show continuous contacts with Gaul from the first half of the 5th century until the early 7th century.\nHeraldic device.\nThe shield or emblem of Sussex, sometimes referred to as a coat of arms, consists of six gold martlets on a blue field. was attributed to the Kingdom of Sussex later in a work called \"Saxon Heptarchy\" by John Speed that dates from 1611. The depiction shows \u00c6lle of Sussex, the founder and first king of Sussex, holding the shield over his shoulder.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the recipient of numerous awards, including an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, seven Golden Globe Awards, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Silver Bear for Best Actor, a Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor, and nominations for two Grammy Awards and a Tony Award. Along with his Best Actor Academy Award win, Newman also received the Academy Honorary Award and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award.\nBorn in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and raised in Shaker Heights, the eastern suburbs of Cleveland, Newman showed an interest in theater as a child and at age 10 performed in a stage production of \"Saint George and the Dragon\" at the Cleveland Play House. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in drama and economics from Kenyon College in 1949. After touring with several summer stock companies including the Belfry Players, Newman attended the Yale School of Drama for a year before studying at the Actors Studio under Lee Strasberg. His first starring Broadway role was in William Inge's \"Picnic\" in 1953 and his final was in Thornton Wilder\u2019s \"Our Town\" in 2003.\nNewman won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in \"The Color of Money\" (1986). His other Oscar-nominated performances were in \n\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" (1958), \"The Hustler\" (1961), \"Hud\" (1963), \"Cool Hand Luke\" (1967), \"Absence of Malice\" (1981), \"The Verdict\" (1982), \"Nobody's Fool\" (1994), and \"Road to Perdition\" (2002). He also starred in such films as \"Somebody Up There Likes Me\" (1956), \"The Long, Hot Summer\" (1958), \"Harper\" (1966), \"Torn Curtain\" (1966), \"Hombre\" (1967), \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (1969), \"The Sting\" (1973), \"The Towering Inferno\" (1974), \"Slap Shot\" (1977), and \"Fort Apache, The Bronx\" (1981). He also voiced Doc Hudson in \"Cars\" (2006).\nNewman won several national championships as a driver in Sports Car Club of America road racing. He co-founded Newman's Own, a food company that donated all post-tax profits and royalties to charity. As of May 2021, these donations totaled over US$570\u00a0million. \nNewman continued to found charitable organizations, such as the SeriousFun Children's Network in 1988 and the Safe Water Network in 2006. Newman was married twice and fathered six children. His second wife was actress Joanne Woodward, with whom he had a screen partnership in directing or acting together throughout their lifetime.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life and family.\nPaul Leonard Newman was born on January 26, 1925, in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and raised in nearby Shaker Heights, the second son of Theresa Garth (\"n\u00e9e\" Fetzer, Fetzko, or Fetsko; ; 1894\u20131982) and Arthur Sigmund Newman Sr. (1893\u20131950), who ran a sporting goods store.\nHis father was Jewish, the son of Simon Newman and Hannah Cohn, Hungarian Jewish and Polish Jewish immigrants.\nNewman's mother was a practitioner of Christian Science. She was born to a Roman Catholic family in Peticse, Zempl\u00edn county, in the Slovakia, (modern Pti\u010die, Slovakia). Newman's mother worked in his father's store while raising Paul and his elder brother Arthur.\nNewman showed an early interest in the theater; his first role was at the age of seven, playing the court jester in a school production of \"Robin Hood\". At age 10, Newman performed at the Cleveland Play House in a production of \"Saint George and the Dragon\", and acted in their Curtain Pullers children's theater program. Graduating from Shaker Heights High School in 1943, he briefly attended Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, where he was initiated into the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity.\nNavy service.\nNewman served in the United States Navy in World War II in the Pacific theater. He enrolled in the Navy V-12 pilot training program at Yale University but was dropped when his colorblindness was diagnosed. He later recounted that it was \"a bit more complicated\" than colorblindness. He also \"couldn't do the mathematical things that being a pilot requires\". A subsequent test found that he was not colorblind. Boot camp followed, with training as a radioman and tail gunner. He performed poorly in that role, and a friend from the service recounted in Newman's posthumous memoir that his friends lied to Navy trainers so he could pass.\nQualifying in torpedo bombers in 1944, Aviation Radioman Third Class Newman was sent to Barbers Point, Hawaii. He was assigned to Pacific-based replacement torpedo squadrons VT-98, VT-99, and VT-100, responsible primarily for training replacement combat pilots and aircrewmen, with special emphasis on carrier landings. Newman later flew as a turret gunner in an Avenger torpedo bomber. As a radioman-gunner, his unit was assigned to the aircraft carrier with other replacements shortly before the Battle of Okinawa in spring 1945. The pilot of his aircraft had an earache and was grounded, as was his crew, including Newman. The rest of their squadron flew to the \"Bunker Hill\". Days later, a kamikaze attack on the vessel killed several hundred crewmen and airmen, including other members of his unit.\nIn a 2011 interview, screenwriter Stewart Stern recounted that Newman drew on an incident from his Navy years as an \"emotional trigger to express the character's trauma\" when acting in the 1956 film \"The Rack\". He said that Newman thought back to an incident in which his best friend was sliced to pieces on an aircraft carrier by a plane's propeller.\nEducation.\nAfter the war, Newman completed a Bachelor of Arts in drama and economics at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, in 1949. Shortly after earning his degree, he joined summer stock companies, including the Belfry Players in Wisconsin and the Woodstock Players in Woodstock, Illinois. He toured with them for three months and developed his talents. He later attended the Yale School of Drama for one year before moving to New York City to study under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Oscar Levant wrote that Newman initially was hesitant to leave New York for Hollywood and that Newman had said, \"Too close to the cake. Also, no place to study.\" Newman arrived in New York City in 1951 with his first wife Jackie Witte, taking up residence in the St. George section of Staten Island.\nCareer.\n1953\u20131958: Early roles.\nHe made his Broadway theatre debut in the original production of William Inge's \"Picnic\" with Kim Stanley in 1953. While working on the production, he met Joanne Woodward, an understudy. The two were married in 1958. He also appeared in the original Broadway production of \"The Desperate Hours\" in 1955. In 1959, he was in the original Broadway production of \"Sweet Bird of Youth\" with Geraldine Page and three years later starred with Page in the film version. During this time Newman started acting in television. His first credited role was in a 1952 episode of \"Tales of Tomorrow\" entitled \"Ice from Space\". In the mid-1950s, he appeared twice on CBS's \"Appointment with Adventure\" anthology series.\nIn February 1954, Newman appeared in a screen test with James Dean, directed by Gjon Mili, for \"East of Eden\" (1955). Newman was tested for the role of Aron Trask, Dean for the role of Aron's twin brother Cal. Dean won his part, but Newman lost out to Richard Davalos. That same year, as a last-minute replacement for Dean, he co-starred with Eva Marie Saint and Frank Sinatra in a live color television broadcast of \"Our Town\", which was a musical adaptation of Thornton Wilder's stage play. After Dean's death, Newman replaced Dean in the role of a boxer in a television adaptation of Hemingway's story \"The Battler\", written by A. E. Hotchner. It was broadcast live on October 18, 1955. That performance led to his breakthrough role as Rocky Graziano in the film \"Somebody Up There Likes Me\" in 1956. The Dean connection had additional resonance. Newman was cast as Billy the Kid in \"The Left Handed Gun\", which was a role originally earmarked for Dean. Additionally, Dean was originally cast to play the role of Rocky Graziano in \"Somebody Up There Likes Me\"; however, with his death, Newman got the role.\nNewman's first film for Hollywood was \"The Silver Chalice\" (1954), co-starring Italian actress Pier Angeli. The film was a box-office failure, and the actor would later acknowledge his disdain for it. In 1956, Newman garnered much attention and acclaim for the role of Rocky Graziano in Robert Wise's biographical film \"Somebody Up There Likes Me\". That year, he also played the lead in Arnold Laven's \"The Rack\". In 1957, Newman worked again with director Wise in \"Until They Sail\". Also that year, he acted in Michael Curtiz's \"The Helen Morgan Story\".\n1958\u20131979: Career stardom and acclaim.\nIn 1958, Newman starred in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" opposite Elizabeth Taylor. The film was a box-office smash, and Newman garnered his first Academy Award nomination. Also in 1958, Newman starred in \"The Long, Hot Summer\" with his future wife Joanne Woodward, with whom he reconnected on the set in 1957 (they had first met in 1953). He won Best Actor at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival for this film. He and Woodward had also appeared on screen earlier in 1958 in the Playhouse 90 television play \"The 80 Yard Run.\" The couple would go on to make a total of 16 films together.\nIn 1959, Newman starred in \"The Young Philadelphians\", a film that also featured Barbara Rush, Robert Vaughn and Alexis Smith and was directed by Vincent Sherman. He also co-starred with Woodward in the film \"Rally Round the Flag, Boys!.\" In 1960, he starred in \"Exodus\" and co-starred with Woodward in \"From the Terrace.\"\nIn 1961, Newman starred in Robert Rossen's \"The Hustler.\" The film, which was based on a book of the same name by Walter Tevis, tells the story of small-time pool hustler \"Fast Eddie\" Felson (Newman) who challenges a legendary pool player portrayed by Jackie Gleason. The film was a critical and financial hit. Newman won both the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award and the Argentinian Film Festival Best Actor awards. He was also nominated for the same prize at that year's Academy Awards. Stanley Kauffmann, writing for \"The New Republic\", praised the principal cast, calling Newman \"first-rate\".\nAlso that year, Newman co-starred with Woodward in \"Paris Blues.\" In 1963, Newman starred in \"Hud\" and co-starred with Woodward in \"A New Kind of Love.\" In 1966, he starred in \"Torn Curtain\" and \"Harper.\"\nIn 1967, Newman starred in Martin Ritt's \"Hombre.\" The film earned many positive reviews. Also that year, he starred in Stuart Rosenberg's \"Cool Hand Luke\". Newman was again nominated for Best Actor at the Academy Awards. In 2005, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, considering it \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". Critic Roger Ebert wrote, \"\"Luke\" is the first Newman character to understand himself well enough to tell us to shove off. He's through risking his neck to make us happy. With this film, Newman completes a cycle of five films over six years, and together they have something to say about the current status of heroism\".\nIn 1968, Newman directed \"Rachel, Rachel\" starring Woodward and based on Margaret Laurence's \"A Jest of God.\" According to Woodward, Newman did not like the book and had no intention of directing the film. He changed his mind when Woodward could not find any other director. To do the project, the pair accepted a deferred payment. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards including Best Picture and won two Golden Globes including Best Director.\nIn 1969, Newman co-starred with Woodward in James Goldstone's auto racing film \"Winning.\" It was one of the top-grossing film that year in the U.S., reaching the thirteenth position and earning $14,644,335.\nAlso that year, Newman teamed with fellow actor Robert Redford and director George Roy Hill for \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\". Scriptwriter William Goldman talked to Newman about his ideas on approaching the subject matter. Once a script was completed, actor Steve McQueen, who had read it, called Newman suggesting that they star in it together. Newman, assuming he would play the character of Sundance, suggested that they jointly buy the intellectual property, at which point McQueen hesitated. It was eventually bought by producer Paul Monash, and Newman was cast as Butch, which created a title change with Redford as Sundance. Newman explained that for the scene where his character performs bicycle tricks a stuntman had been hired, though the footage had left director Hill unsatisfied; Newman had to perform the tricks. Furthermore, Newman explained that it was his idea with Goldman to develop the musical interlude. The film was a success, grossing over $15 million at the box office, and it was fourth highest-grossing film of the year. At the Academy Awards it was nominated for Best Picture as well as well as receiving nominations in other categories.\nFinally that year, along with Barbra Streisand and Sidney Poitier, Newman formed First Artists Production Company so actors could secure properties and develop movie projects for themselves.\nIn 1970, Newman produced and co-starred with Woodward in Stuart Rosenberg's \"WUSA,\" based on Robert Stone's novel \"A Hall of Mirrors.\" Newman and his partner John Foreman purchased the rights for $50,000. The film flopped both commercially and critically. However, Newman later said that it is \"the most significant film I've ever made and the best\".\nIn 1971, Newman directed and starred in \"Sometimes a Great Notion\" based on Ken Kesey's novel. Although several directors were considered, it was announced that Newman would direct. However, Richard A. Colla was signed to direct the film in May 1970. Five weeks after principal photography began, Colla left the project due to \"artistic differences over photographic concept\", as well as a required throat operation. At the same time, Newman broke his ankle and the production shut down on July 29. As co-executive producer, Newman considered replacing Colla with George Roy Hill, but Hill declined the offer, so when filming resumed two weeks later, Newman was directing. \nAlso that year, Newman hosted David Winters' made-for-TV documentary \"Once Upon a Wheel\". Winters said that at the time Newman had publicly stated he did not want to do television and turned it down for that reason until Winters explained his own vision to Newman. Newman, a race car enthusiast, said, \"The show gives me a chance to get close to a sport I'm crazy about. I love to test a car on my own, to see what I can do, but racing with 25 other guys is a whole different thing. There are so many variables, the skill demanded is tremendous.\" Bob Bondurant, Newman's driving instructor who appears in the film, explained that \"Once Upon a Wheel\" was a passion project for Newman \"because he wanted to learn how to drive\" and that he had refused projects that would have paid him a much larger salary. The project marked Newman's return to television after a decade long absence, and his first time as the lead of a program. During post-production, Winters said that Newman, who liked what he saw, gave him the idea to add some footage to sell it as a theatrical film worldwide. Upon its release, the documentary generally received good reviews for its directing, pace, photography, music, and human interest stories.\nIn 1972, Newman's vehicles produced by First Artists included \"Pocket Money\" and \"The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean\". Also that year, Newman directed \"The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds\", the screen version of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name\".\" It was in competition at the Cannes Film Festival, and Joanne Woodward won the best actress award.\nIn 1973, Newman reunited with director George Roy Hill and fellow actor Robert Redford in \"The Sting\". The film made over $68,000,000 in the North American box office and was the highest-grossing film of 1974. For his participation, Newman received top billing, $500,000, and a percentage of the profits. The film was awarded Best Picture at the Academy Awards.\nIn 1974, Newman co-starred with Steve McQueen in John Guillermin's disaster film \"The Towering Inferno\". Newman plays an architect trapped in a burning skyscraper that he had designed. Newman was paid $1,000,000 plus a percentage of the gross, and he insisted that he do his own stunts. The film was a success and its North American gross was $55,000,000.\nIn 1975, his third film with First Artists was the \"Harper\" sequel \"The Drowning Pool\", in which Woodward appeared.\nIn 1977, Newman reunited with director Hill in the hockey sport comedy \"Slap Shot.\" At the time of its release the film received mixed reviews, many saying that it was \"setting a new standard in its use of obscenities\". Years later on Home Video and cable showings the film gained cult status.\n1980\u20131999: Late career roles and Oscar win.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFrank Galvin provides Newman with the occasion for one of his great performances. This is the first movie in which Newman has looked a little old, a little tired. There are moments when his face sags and his eyes seem terribly weary ... [Newman] gives us old, bone-tired, hung-over, trembling (and heroic) Frank Galvin, and we buy it lock, stock and shot glass.\n\u2014Roger Ebert (1982)\nIn 1980, Newman directed the television screen version of the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning play \"The Shadow Box\". In 1981, he acted in Sydney Pollack's \"Absence of Malice\". He starred in Sidney Lumet's \"The Verdict\" in 1982. The film was nominated for Academy Award for Best Picture, and Newman received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. In 1984, Newman starred in and directed \"Harry &amp; Son\".\nIn 1986, twenty-five years after \"The Hustler\", Newman reprised his role of \"Fast Eddie\" Felson in the Martin Scorsese\u2013directed film \"The Color of Money\", for which he finally received the Academy Award for Best Actor. The film was a commercial success although it received mixed reviews. Newman starred with Tom Cruise, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and John Turturro.\nIn mid-1987, Newman sued Universal Pictures for allegedly failing to account properly for revenues from video distribution of four of his films made for Universal and that Universal owed him at least $1 million for the home video versions of \"The Sting\", \"Slap Shot\", \"Winning\", and \"Sometimes a Great Notion\". The complaint claimed that Universal accounted for the cassette revenues in a way that improperly decreased amounts due to Newman, with the actor wanting a full accounting along with $2 million in damages.\nAlso in 1987, Newman directed a screen version of Tennessee Williams' \"The Glass Menagerie\" starring his wife Joanne Woodward, John Malkovich, and Karen Allen. The film was in competition at the Cannes Film Festival. \"Variety\" called it \"a reverent record\" of the Williams play that \"one watches with a kind of distant dreaminess rather than an intense emotional involvement\" and cited the \"brilliant performances ... well defined by Newman's direction\".\nIn 1990, Newman co-starred with Woodward in the James Ivory film adaptation \"Mr. and Mrs. Bridge\" based on the Evan S. Connell novel of the same name. In 1994, Newman played alongside Tim Robbins as the character Sidney J. Mussburger in the Coen brothers comedy \"The Hudsucker Proxy\", which received mixed reviews. Also that year, he acted in Robert Benton's \"Nobody's Fool\" earning yet another nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n2000\u20132008.\nIn 2003, Newman appeared in a Broadway revival of Wilder's \"Our Town\", winning a nomination for a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his performance. PBS and the cable network Showtime aired a taping of the production, and Newman was nominated for an Emmy Award as well for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or TV Movie. Newman's last live-action movie appearance was as a conflicted mob boss in the Sam Mendes-directed film \"Road to Perdition\" (2002) opposite Tom Hanks, Jude Law, and Stanley Tucci. For his performance he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\nAlthough he continued to provide voice work for movies, Newman's last live-action appearance was in the 2005 HBO mini-series \"Empire Falls\", based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Richard Russo), in which he played the dissolute father of the protagonist Miles Roby and for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie.\nIn keeping with his strong interest in auto racing, Newman provided the voice of Doc Hudson, a retired anthropomorphic race car, in \"Cars\" (2006). This was his final role in a major feature film as well as his only animated film role. Almost nine years after his death, he was billed as Doc Hudson in \"Cars 3\" (2017), his appearance made possible through the use of archival recordings. Newman retired from acting in May 2007, saying: \"You start to lose your memory, you start to lose your confidence, you start to lose your invention. So I think that's pretty much a closed book for me.\" He came out of retirement to record narration for the 2007 documentary \"Dale\" about the life of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt and for the 2008 documentary \"The Meerkats\", his final film role overall.\nPersonal life.\nMarriages and family.\nNewman was married twice. His first marriage was to Jackie Witte (1929\u20131994) from 1949 to 1958. They had a son, Scott (1950\u20131978) and two daughters, Susan (1953\u20132025) and Stephanie Kendall (born 1954). Scott, who appeared in films including \"The Towering Inferno\" (1974), \"Breakheart Pass\" (1975), and \"Fraternity Row\" (1977) died in November 1978 from a drug overdose. Newman started the Scott Newman Center for drug abuse prevention in memory of his son. Susan was a documentary filmmaker and philanthropist and had Broadway and screen credits, including a starring role as one of four Beatles fans in \"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\" (1978), and also a small role opposite her father in \"Slap Shot\" and appeared in \"A Wedding\" (1978). She also received a Golden Globe and Humanitas Award, plus Emmy, Peabody and Grammy Awards nominations, for her role as co-producer of Newman's 1980 telefilm \"The Shadow Box\". She died on 2 August 2025 at the age of 72; her death was not made public until October 7, 2025.\nNewman met actress Joanne Woodward in 1953, on the production of \"Picnic\" on Broadway. It was Newman's debut; Woodward was an understudy. Shortly after filming \"The Long, Hot Summer\" in 1957, he divorced Witte to marry Woodward. The Newmans moved to East 11th Street in Manhattan, before buying a home and raising their family in Westport, Connecticut. They were one of the first Hollywood movie star couples to choose to raise their families outside California. They remained married for 50 years until his death in 2008. Woodward has said \"He's very good looking and very sexy and all of those things, but all of that goes out the window and what is finally left is, if you can make somebody laugh... And he sure does keep me laughing.\" Newman has attributed their relationship success to \"some combination of lust and respect and patience. And determination.\"\nThey had three daughters: Elinor \"Nell\" Teresa (b. 1959), Melissa \"Lissy\" Stewart (b. 1961), and Claire \"Clea\" Olivia (b. 1965). Newman was well known for his devotion to his wife and family. When once asked about his reputation for fidelity, he famously quipped, \"Why go out for a hamburger when you have steak at home?\" He also said that he never met anyone who had as much to lose as he did. In his profile on \"60 Minutes\", he admitted he once left Woodward after a fight, walked around the outside of the house, knocked on the front door and explained to Joanne he had nowhere to go. Newman directed Nell alongside her mother in the films \"Rachel, Rachel\" and \"The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds\". Newman and Woodward also acted as mentors to Allison Janney. They met her while she was a freshman at Kenyon College during a play Newman was directing.\nIn his biography \"Paul Newman: A Life\" (2009) film critic Shawn Levy alleged that Newman had had an affair in the late 1960s with divorc\u00e9e Nancy Bacon, a Hollywood journalist, that lasted one and a half years. In an article in the \"Irish Independent\", which stated also that Levy's claims \"caused outrage\" and were widely considered \"an attempt to sully the image of a revered cinematic legend and committed philanthropist\", the affair was reportedly denied by a friend of Newman's wife Joanne, who said she was upset by the claim. Levy criticized the tabloid newspaper the \"New York Post\", which had a long-standing feud with Newman, for focusing on and emphasizing this aspect of his biography.\nNewman and Woodward were the subject of a 2022 docuseries by Ethan Hawke, \"The Last Movie Stars\", which was broadcast on HBO Max. The docuseries was based upon tapes compiled by Newman's friend Stewart Stern for a memoir that Newman abandoned but which was eventually published in 2022 as \"The Extraordinary Life of An Ordinary Man.\" Laura Linney voiced Woodward and George Clooney voiced Newman.\nJewish identity.\nEven though Newman followed the pluralistic Unitarian Universalism movement as an adult, he called himself a Jew, \"because it's more of a challenge\". When he applied to Kenyon College after the Navy he gave his religion as \"Christian Scientist\", but apart from that he did not deny that he was Jewish. He recounted in his posthumous memoirs having a \"strong sense of otherness\" as a youth because he was half-Jewish. His heritage \"got in the way of my sitting at the 'A' table, which was important to me,\" but he received no instruction on his Jewish heritage. He only knew that \"if you were Jewish, some avenues were shut to you,\" and that \"hurt me and my brother a great deal.\" Newman deflected the pain with humor, sometimes doing Yiddish voices \"for laughs.\" He was excluded from a high school fraternity because he was Jewish, and got into a \"bloody fight\" in the Navy because a sailor used an anti-Semitic slur. A family friend recounted that the \"stigma\" of being Jewish was strong in Shaker Heights at the time. \"Paul didn't seem Jewish at all, but he paid a price, he had a rough time.\"\nAfter he began appearing in films, Newman made a point of not changing his name. When he was being considered for the role of Terry Malloy in \"On the Waterfront\", producer Sam Spiegel asked him to \"get rid of 'Paul Newman'\". Newman's response to Spiegel was, \"What do you want me to change it to, 'S.P. Ewman'?\"\nIllness and death.\nNewman was scheduled to make his professional stage directing debut with the Westport Country Playhouse's 2008 production of John Steinbeck's \"Of Mice and Men\", but he stepped down on May 23, 2008, citing his health concerns.\nIn June 2008, it was widely reported in the press that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer and was receiving treatment for the condition at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. A.E. Hotchner, who partnered in the 1980s with Newman to start Newman's Own, told the Associated Press in an interview in mid-2008 that Newman had told him about being afflicted with the disease about 18 months earlier. Newman's spokesman told the press that the star was \"doing nicely\", but neither confirmed nor denied that he had lung cancer. Newman was a heavy cigarette smoker for most of his life until he quit in 1986.\nNewman died at his home in Westport, Connecticut, on the morning of September 26, 2008, at the age of 83. He was cremated after a private funeral service.\nPhilanthropy.\nWith writer A. E. Hotchner, Newman founded Newman's Own, a line of food products, in 1982. The brand started with salad dressing and has expanded to include pasta sauce, lemonade, popcorn, salsa, and wine, among other things. Newman established a policy that all proceeds, after taxes, would be donated to charity. He co-wrote a memoir about the subject with Hotchner, \"Shameless Exploitation in Pursuit of the Common Good\". Among other awards, Newman's Own co-sponsors the PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award, a $25,000 reward designed to recognize those who protect the First Amendment as it applies to the written word.\nOne beneficiary of his philanthropy is the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, a residential summer camp for seriously ill children located in Ashford, Connecticut, which Newman co-founded in 1988. It is named after the gang in his film \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (1969), and the real-life, historic Hole-in-the-Wall outlaw hangout in the mountains of northern Wyoming. Newman's college fraternity, Phi Kappa Tau, adopted his Connecticut Hole in the Wall camp as their \"national philanthropy\" in 1995. The original camp has expanded to become several Hole in the Wall Camps in the U.S., Ireland, France, and Israel. In 1988, Newman founded the SeriousFun Children's Network, a global family of summer camps and programs for children with serious illnesses. In 2006, Newman also co-founded Safe Water Network with John Whitehead, former chairman of Goldman Sachs, and Josh Weston, former chairman of ADP, to improve access to safe water to underserved communities around the world.\nIn 1983, Newman became a major donor for The Mirror Theater Ltd, alongside Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino, matching a grant from Laurance Rockefeller. Newman was inspired to invest by his connection with Lee Strasberg, as Lee's then daughter-in-law Sabra Jones was the founder and producing artistic director of The Mirror. Paul Newman remained a friend of the company until his death and discussed at numerous times possible productions in which he could star with his wife, Joanne Woodward. In June 1999, Newman donated $250,000 to Catholic Relief Services to aid refugees in Kosovo.\nOn June 1, 2007, Kenyon College announced that Newman had donated $10\u00a0million to the school to establish a scholarship fund as part of the college's $230\u00a0million fund-raising campaign. Newman and Woodward were honorary co-chairs of a previous campaign.\nNewman was one of the founders of the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy (CECP). Newman was named the Most Generous Celebrity of 2008 by Givingback.org. He contributed $20,857,000 for the year of 2008 to the Newman's Own Foundation, which distributes funds to a variety of charities.\nUpon Newman's death, the Italian newspaper (a \"semi-official\" paper of the Holy See) \"L'Osservatore Romano\" published a notice lauding Newman's philanthropy. It also commented that \"Newman was a generous heart, an actor of a dignity and style rare in Hollywood quarters.\"\nNewman was responsible for preserving lands around Westport, Connecticut. He lobbied the state's governor for funds for the 2011 Aspetuck Land Trust in Easton. In 2011, Paul Newman's estate gifted land to Westport to be managed by the Aspetuck Land Trust.\nPolitical activism.\nNewman was a lifelong Democrat, although he endorsed and voted for Independent candidate John B. Anderson in 1980, who was a liberal Republican, instead of the incumbent Democratic president, Jimmy Carter. For Newman's support of Eugene McCarthy in 1968, effective use of television commercials in California, and his opposition to the Vietnam War, Newman was placed nineteenth on Richard Nixon's enemies list, which Newman claimed was his greatest accomplishment. In 1964, he and his wife, Joanne Woodward, supported Lyndon B. Johnson for president. During the 1968 presidential election, Newman supported Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey and appeared in a pre-election night telethon for him. He was also described as a \"vocal supporter\" of gay rights and same-sex marriage.\nNewman was linked to the \"Malibu Mafia\" to promote progressive issues in politics. This was a group of wealthy men in the Greater Los Angeles area who met to discuss politics. Backed by them, Newman and his wife went to Washington in 1976 to speak in favor of breaking up Big Oil into separate components. Newman supported their 1980s effort to establish a bilateral Nuclear Freeze to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the United States and the Soviet Union. He said he would stand up for Walter Mondale in the 1984 presidential election as long as there was cold Budweiser and Nuclear Freeze involved.\nIn January 1995, Newman was the chief investor of a group, including the writer E. L. Doctorow and the editor Victor Navasky, that bought the progressive periodical \"The Nation\". Newman was an occasional writer for the publication. He endorsed Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election. He endorsed Howard Dean's presidential campaign in 2004.\nConsistent with his work for liberal causes, Newman publicly supported Ned Lamont's candidacy in the 2006 Connecticut Democratic Primary against Senator Joe Lieberman, and was even rumored as a candidate himself, until Lamont emerged as a credible alternative. He donated to Chris Dodd's presidential campaign. Newman earlier donated money to Bill Richardson's campaign for president in 2008. Newman attended the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, and was also present at the first Earth Day event in Manhattan on April 22, 1970. Newman was concerned about global warming and supported nuclear energy development as a solution.\nAuto racing.\nNewman was an auto racing enthusiast and first became interested in motorsports (\"the first thing that I ever found I had any grace in\") while training at the Watkins Glen Racing School for the filming of \"Winning\", a 1969 film. According to his instructor Bob Bondurant, his love and passion for racing, Newman agreed in 1971 to star in and to host television special \"Once Upon a Wheel,\" on the history of auto racing. Newman's first professional event as a racer was in 1972 at Thompson International Speedway, quietly entered as \"P. L. Newman\", by which he continued to be known in the racing community.\nNewman was a frequent competitor in Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) events for the rest of the decade, eventually winning four national championships. He later drove in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans in Dick Barbour's Porsche 935, finishing in second place. Newman reunited with Barbour in 2000 to compete in the Petit Le Mans.\nFrom the mid-1970s to the early 1990s, he drove for the \"Bob Sharp Racing\" team, racing mainly Datsuns (later rebranded as Nissans) in the Trans-Am Series. He became closely associated with the brand during the 1980s, even appearing in commercials for the brand in Japan and having a special edition of the Nissan Skyline named after him. At the age of 70 years and eight days, Newman became the oldest driver to date to be part of a winning team in a major sanctioned race, winning in his class at the 1995 24 Hours of Daytona. Among his last major races were the Baja 1000 in 2004 and the 24 Hours of Daytona once again in 2005.\nDuring the 1976 auto racing season, Newman became interested in forming a professional auto racing team and contacted Bill Freeman, who introduced Newman to professional auto racing management, and their company specialized in Can-Am, Indy Cars, and other high-performance racing automobiles. The team was based in Santa Barbara, California, and commuted to Willow Springs International Motorsports Park for many of its testing sessions.\nTheir \"Newman Freeman Racing\" team was very competitive in the North American Can-Am series in its Budweiser-sponsored, Chevrolet-powered Spyder NFs. Newman and Freeman began a long and successful partnership with the Newman Freeman Racing team in the Can-Am series, which culminated in the Can-Am Team Championship trophy in 1979. Newman was associated with Freeman's established Porsche racing team, which enabled both Newman and Freeman to compete in SCCA and IMSA racing events together, including the Sebring 12-hour endurance sports car race. This car was sponsored by Beverly Porsche/Audi. Freeman was Sports Car Club of America's Southern Pacific National Champion during the Newman Freeman period. Later, Newman co-founded Newman/Haas Racing with Carl Haas, a Champ Car team, in 1983, going on to win eight drivers' championships under his ownership. Newman was also briefly an owner in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series when he co-founded a research and development #18 team with Hendrick Motorsports' Greg Sacks behind the wheel; the team shut down after two seasons after losing its primary sponsor. The 1996 racing season was chronicled in the IMAX film \"Super Speedway\" (1997), which Newman narrated. He was a partner in the Atlantic Championship team Newman Wachs Racing. Newman voiced Doc Hudson in \"Cars (2006)\".\nHaving said he would quit \"when I embarrass myself\", Newman competed into his 80s, winning at Lime Rock in what former co-driver Sam Posey called a \"brutish Corvette\", which displayed his age as its number: 81. He took the pole in his last professional race, in 2007 at Watkins Glen International, and in a 2008 run at Lime Rock, arranged by friends, he reportedly still did 9/10 of his best time. Newman was posthumously inducted into the SCCA Hall of Fame at the national convention in Las Vegas, Nevada, on February 21, 2009. Lime Rock Park's No Name Straight was renamed Paul Newman Straight in 2022. Newman's racing life was chronicled in the documentary \"\" (2015).\nMotorsports career results\nSCCA National Championship Runoffs\n Complete 24 Hours of Le Mans results \nActing credits.\nSelected film credits:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAwards and honors.\nNewman was nominated for an Academy Award in five different decades. In addition to awards Newman won for specific roles, he received an honorary Academy Award in 1986 for his \"many and memorable and compelling screen performances\" and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for his charity work in 1994.\nIn 1992, Newman and his wife, Joanne Woodward, were recipients of Kennedy Center Honors. In 1994, the couple received the Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, an award given annually by Jefferson Awards. Newman won Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival for \"The Long, Hot Summer\" and the Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival for \"Nobody's Fool\".\nIn 1968, Newman was named Man of the Year by Harvard University's performance group, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals. The 2008 edition of \"Sport Movies &amp; TV \u2013 Milano International FICTS Fest\" was dedicated to his memory. In 2015, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 'forever stamp' commemorating Newman, which went on sale on September 18, 2015. It features a 1980 photograph of Newman by photographer Steve Schapiro, accompanied by text that reads: 'Actor/Philanthropist'.\nSince the 1970s, Newman Day is an event celebrated at Kenyon College, Bates College, Princeton University, and some other American colleges. On Newman Day, students try to drink 24 beers in 24 hours, based on a quote attributed to Newman about there being 24 beers in a case, and 24 hours in a day, and that this is surely not a mere coincidence. In 2004, Newman requested that Princeton University dissociate the event from his name, due to the fact that he did not endorse the behavior. He cited his creation in 1980 of the Scott Newman Center, \"dedicated to the prevention of substance abuse through education\". Princeton disavowed any responsibility for the event, responding that Newman Day is not sponsored, endorsed, or encouraged by the university itself and is solely an unofficial event among students.\nOn October 26, 2017, Paul Newman's Rolex Daytona wristwatch was auctioned in New York by Phillips Auctions for $17.5\u00a0million, making it one of the most expensive wristwatches ever sold at an auction. On September 3, 2022, Lime Rock Park, a road course in Lakeville, Connecticut, named the straight of the circuit past the Esses before The Uphill the Paul Newman Straight during the Historic Festival 40.\nNewman was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2024.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

The data is then permanent. It is one type of read-only memory (ROM). PROMs are usually used in digital electronic devices to store low level programs such as firmware or microcode. PROMs may be used during development of a system that will ultimately be converted to ROMs in a mass produced version. These types of memories are used in microcontrollers, video game consoles, mobile phones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, implantable medical devices, high-definition multimedia interfaces (HDMI), and in many other consumer and automotive products.\nPROMs are manufactured blank and, depending on the technology, can be programmed at the wafer, final test, or system stage. Blank PROM chips are programmed by plugging them into a device called a \"PROM programmer\". A typical PROM device has an array of memory cells. The bipolar transistors in the cells have an emitter that is connected to a fuse called a polyfuse. To program a PROM is to strategically blow the polyfuses.\nHistory.\nThe PROM was invented in 1956 by Wen Tsing Chow, working for the Arma Division of the American Bosch Arma Corporation in Garden City, New York. The invention was conceived at the request of the United States Air Force to come up with a more flexible and secure way of storing the targeting constants in the Atlas E/F ICBM's airborne digital computer. The patent and associated technology were held under secrecy order for several years while the Atlas E/F was the main operational missile of the United States ICBM force. The term \"burn\", referring to the process of programming a PROM, is also in the original patent, as one of the original implementations was to literally burn the internal whiskers of diodes with a current overload to produce a circuit discontinuity. The first PROM programming machines were also developed by Arma engineers under Chow's direction and were located in Arma's Garden City lab and Air Force Strategic Air Command (SAC) headquarters.\nOne time programmable memory.\nOTP (one time programmable) memory is a special type of non-volatile memory (NVM) that permits data to be written to memory only once. Once the memory has been programmed, it retains its value upon loss of power (i.e., is non-volatile). OTP memory is used in applications where reliable and repeatable reading of data is required. Examples include boot code, encryption keys and configuration parameters for analog, sensor or display circuitry. OTP NVM is characterized, over other types of NVM like eFuse or EEPROM, by offering a low power, small area footprint memory structure. As such, OTP memory finds application in products from microprocessors &amp; display drivers to power management ICs (PMICs).\nCommercially available semiconductor antifuse-based OTP memory arrays have been around at least since 1969, with initial antifuse bit cells dependent on blowing a capacitor between crossing conductive lines. Texas Instruments developed a MOS gate oxide breakdown antifuse in 1979. A dual-gate-oxide two-transistor (2T) MOS antifuse was introduced in 1982. Early oxide breakdown technologies exhibited a variety of scaling, programming, size and manufacturing problems that prevented volume production of memory devices based on these technologies.\nAnother form of one-time programmable memory device uses the same semiconductor chip as an ultraviolet-erasable programmable read-only memory (UV-EPROM), but the finished device is put into an opaque package, instead of the expensive ceramic package with transparent quartz window required for erasing. These devices are programmed with the same methods as the UV EPROM parts but are less costly. Embedded controllers may be available in both field-erasable and one-time styles, allowing a cost saving in volume production without the expense and lead time of factory-programmed mask ROM chips. \nAlthough antifuse-based PROM has been available for decades, it wasn\u2019t available in standard CMOS until 2001 when Kilopass Technology Inc. patented 1T, 2T, and 3.5T antifuse bit cell technologies using a standard CMOS process, enabling integration of PROM into logic CMOS chips. The first process node antifuse can be implemented in standard CMOS is 0.18\u00a0um. Since the gate oxide breakdown is less than the junction breakdown, special diffusion steps were not required to create the antifuse programming element. In 2005, a split channel antifuse device was introduced by Sidense. This split channel bit cell combines the thick (IO) and thin (gate) oxide devices into one transistor (1T) with a common polysilicon gate.\nProgramming.\nA typical PROM comes with all bits reading as \"1\". Burning a fuse bit during programming causes the bit to be read as \"0\" by \"blowing\" the fuses, which is an irreversible process. Some devices can be \"reprogrammed\" if the new data replaces \"1\"s with \"0\"s. Some CPU instruction sets (e.g. 6502) took advantage of this by defining a break (BRK) instruction with the operation code of '00'. In cases where there was an incorrect instruction, it could be \"reprogrammed\" to a BRK causing the CPU to transfer control to a patch. This would execute the correct instruction and return to the instruction after the BRK.\nThe bit cell is programmed by applying a high-voltage pulse not encountered during a normal operation across the gate and substrate of the thin oxide transistor (around 6V for a 2\u00a0nm thick oxide, or 30MV/cm) to break down the oxide between gate and substrate. The positive voltage on the transistor's gate forms an inversion channel in the substrate below the gate, causing a tunneling current to flow through the oxide. The current produces additional traps in the oxide, increasing the current through the oxide and ultimately melting the oxide and forming a conductive channel from gate to substrate. The current required to form the conductive channel is around 100\u03bcA/100nm2 and the breakdown occurs in approximately 100\u03bcs or less.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The SI unit of the Poynting vector is the watt per square metre (W/m2); kg/s3 in SI base units. It is named after its discoverer John Henry Poynting who first derived it in 1884.132 Nikolay Umov is also credited with formulating the concept. Oliver Heaviside also discovered it independently in the more general form that recognises the freedom of adding the curl of an arbitrary vector field to the definition. The Poynting vector is used throughout electromagnetics in conjunction with Poynting's theorem, the continuity equation expressing conservation of electromagnetic energy, to calculate the power flow in electromagnetic fields.\nDefinition.\nIn Poynting's original paper and in most textbooks, the Poynting vector formula_1 is defined as the cross product\nformula_2\nwhere bold letters represent vectors and\nThis expression is often called the \"Abraham form\" and is the most widely used. The Poynting vector is usually denoted by S or N.\nIn simple terms, the Poynting vector S, \"at a point\", gives the magnitude and direction of surface power density that are due to electromagnetic fields \"at that point\". More rigorously, it is the quantity that must be used to make Poynting's theorem valid. Poynting's theorem essentially says that the difference between the electromagnetic energy entering a region and the electromagnetic energy leaving a region must equal the energy converted or dissipated in that region, that is, turned into a different form of energy (often heat). Poynting's theorem is simply a statement of local conservation of energy.\nIf electromagnetic energy is not gained from or lost to other forms of energy within some region (e.g., mechanical energy or heating), then electromagnetic energy is locally conserved within that region, yielding a continuity equation as a special case of Poynting's theorem:\nformula_3\nwhere formula_4 is the energy density of the electromagnetic field. This frequent condition holds in the following simple example in which the Poynting vector is calculated and seen to be consistent with the usual computation of power in an electric circuit.\nExample: Power flow in a coaxial cable.\nWe can find a relatively simple solution in the case of power transmission through a section of coaxial cable analyzed in cylindrical coordinates as depicted in the accompanying diagram. The model's symmetry implies that there is no dependence on \"\u03b8\" (circular symmetry) nor on \"Z\" (position along the cable). The model (and solution) can be considered simply as a DC circuit with no time dependence, but the following solution applies equally well to the transmission of radio frequency power, as long as we are considering an instant of time (during which the voltage and current don't change), and over a sufficiently short segment of cable (much smaller than a wavelength, so that these quantities are not dependent on \"Z\").\nThe coaxial cable is specified as having an inner conductor of radius \"R\"1 and an outer conductor whose inner radius is \"R\"2 (its thickness beyond \"R\"2 doesn't affect the following analysis). In between \"R\"1 and \"R\"2 the cable contains an ideal dielectric material of relative permittivity \"\u03b5\"r and we assume conductors that are non-magnetic (so \"\u03bc\" = \"\u03bc\"0) and lossless (perfect conductors), all of which are good approximations to real-world coaxial cable in typical situations.\nThe central conductor is at voltage \"V\" and draws a current \"I\" toward the right, so we expect a total power flow of \"P\" = \"V\" \u00b7 \"I\" according to basic laws of electricity. By evaluating the Poynting vector, however, we are able to identify the profile of power flow in terms of the electric and magnetic fields inside the coaxial cable. The electric field is zero inside of each conductor, but between the conductors (formula_5), symmetry dictates that it is in the radial direction and it can be shown (using Gauss's law) that they must obey the following form:\nformula_6\n\"W\" can be evaluated by integrating the electric field from formula_7 to formula_8 which must be the negative of the voltage \"V\":\nformula_9\nso that:\nformula_10\nThe magnetic field, again by symmetry, can be non-zero only in the \"\u03b8\" direction, that is, a vector field looping around the center conductor at every radius between \"R\"1 and \"R\"2. \"Inside\" the conductors themselves the magnetic field may or may not be zero, but this is of no concern since the Poynting vector in these regions is zero due to the electric field being zero. Outside the entire coaxial cable, the magnetic field is identically zero since paths in this region enclose a net current of zero (+\"I\" in the center conductor and \u2212\"I\" in the outer conductor), and again the electric field is zero there anyway. Using Amp\u00e8re's law in the region from \"R\"1 to \"R\"2, which encloses the current +\"I\" in the center conductor but with no contribution from the current in the outer conductor, we find at radius \"r\":\nformula_11\nNow, from an electric field in the radial direction, and a tangential magnetic field, the Poynting vector, given by the cross-product of these, is only non-zero in the \"Z\" direction, along the direction of the coaxial cable itself, as we would expect. Again only a function of \"r\", we can evaluate S(\"r\"):\nformula_12\nwhere \"W\" is given above in terms of the center conductor voltage \"V\". The \"total\" power flowing down the coaxial cable can be computed by integrating over the entire cross section A of the cable in between the conductors:\nformula_13\nSubstituting the earlier solution for the constant \"W\" we find:\nformula_14\nthat is, the power given by integrating the Poynting vector over a cross section of the coaxial cable is exactly equal to the product of voltage and current as one would have computed for the power delivered using basic laws of electricity.\nOther similar examples in which the \"P\" = \"V\" \u00b7 \"I\" result can be analytically calculated are: the parallel-plate transmission line, using Cartesian coordinates, and the two-wire transmission line, using bipolar cylindrical coordinates.\nOther forms.\nIn the \"microscopic\" version of Maxwell's equations, this definition must be replaced by a definition in terms of the electric field E and the magnetic flux density B (described later in the article).\nIt is also possible to combine the electric displacement field D with the magnetic flux B to get the \"Minkowski form\" of the Poynting vector, or use D and H to construct yet another version. The choice has been controversial: Pfeifer et al. summarize and to a certain extent resolve the century-long dispute between proponents of the Abraham and Minkowski forms (see Abraham\u2013Minkowski controversy).\nThe Poynting vector represents the particular case of an energy flux vector for electromagnetic energy. However, any type of energy has its direction of movement in space, as well as its density, so energy flux vectors can be defined for other types of energy as well, e.g., for mechanical energy. The Umov\u2013Poynting vector discovered by Nikolay Umov in 1874 describes energy flux in liquid and elastic media in a completely generalized view.\nInterpretation.\nThe Poynting vector appears in Poynting's theorem (see that article for the derivation), an energy-conservation law:\nformula_15\nwhere Jf is the current density of free charges and \"u\" is the electromagnetic energy density for linear, nondispersive materials, given by\nformula_16\nwhere\nThe first term in the right-hand side represents the electromagnetic energy flow into a small volume, while the second term subtracts the work done by the field on free electrical currents, which thereby exits from electromagnetic energy as dissipation, heat, etc. In this definition, bound electrical currents are not included in this term and instead contribute to S and \"u\".\nFor light in free space, the linear momentum density is\nformula_17\nFor linear, nondispersive (in which all frequency components travel at the same speed) and isotropic (for simplicity) materials, the constitutive relations can be written as\nformula_18\nwhere\nHere \"\u03b5\" and \"\u03bc\" are scalar, real-valued constants independent of position, direction, and frequency.\nIn principle, this limits Poynting's theorem in this form to fields in vacuum and nondispersive linear materials. A generalization to dispersive materials is possible under certain circumstances at the cost of additional terms.\nOne consequence of the Poynting formula is that for the electromagnetic field to do work, both magnetic and electric fields must be present. The magnetic field alone or the electric field alone cannot do any work.\nPlane waves.\nIn a propagating electromagnetic plane wave in an isotropic lossless medium, the instantaneous Poynting vector always points in the direction of propagation while rapidly oscillating in magnitude. This can be simply seen given that in a plane wave, the magnitude of the magnetic field H(\"r\", \"t\") is given by the magnitude of the electric field vector E(\"r\", \"t\") divided by \"\u03b7\", the intrinsic impedance of the transmission medium:\nformula_19\nwhere |A| represents the vector norm of A. Since E and H are at right angles to each other, the magnitude of their cross product is the product of their magnitudes. Without loss of generality let us take \"X\" to be the direction of the electric field and \"Y\" to be the direction of the magnetic field. The instantaneous Poynting vector, given by the cross product of E and H will then be in the positive \"Z\" direction:\nformula_20\nFinding the time-averaged power in the plane wave then requires averaging over the wave period (the inverse frequency of the wave):\nformula_21\nwhere \"E\"rms is the root mean square (RMS) electric field amplitude. In the important case that \"E\"(\"t\") is sinusoidally varying at some frequency with peak amplitude \"E\"peak, \"E\"rms is formula_22, with the average Poynting vector then given by:\nformula_23\nThis is the most common form for the energy flux of a plane wave, since sinusoidal field amplitudes are most often expressed in terms of their peak values, and complicated problems are typically solved considering only one frequency at a time. However, the expression using \"E\"rms is totally general, applying, for instance, in the case of noise whose RMS amplitude can be measured but where the \"peak\" amplitude is meaningless. In free space the intrinsic impedance \"\u03b7\" is simply given by the impedance of free space \"\u03b7\"0 \u2248377\u03a9. In non-magnetic dielectrics (such as all transparent materials at optical frequencies) with a specified dielectric constant \"\u03b5\"r, or in optics with a material whose refractive index formula_24, the intrinsic impedance is found as:\nformula_25\nIn optics, the value of radiated flux crossing a surface, thus the average Poynting vector component in the direction normal to that surface, is technically known as the irradiance, more often simply referred to as the \"intensity\" (a somewhat ambiguous term).\nFormulation in terms of microscopic fields.\nThe \"microscopic\" (differential) version of Maxwell's equations admits only the fundamental fields E and B, without a built-in model of material media. Only the vacuum permittivity and permeability are used, and there is no D or H. When this model is used, the Poynting vector is defined as\nformula_26\nwhere\nThis is actually the general expression of the Poynting vector. The corresponding form of Poynting's theorem is\nformula_27\nwhere J is the \"total\" current density and the energy density \"u\" is given by\nformula_28\nwhere \"\u03b5\"0 is the vacuum permittivity. It can be derived directly from Maxwell's equations in terms of \"total\" charge and current and the Lorentz force law only.\nThe two alternative definitions of the Poynting \"vector\" are equal in vacuum or in non-magnetic materials, where B = \"\u03bc\"0H. In all other cases, they differ in that S = (1/\"\u03bc\"0) E \u00d7 B and the corresponding \"u\" are purely radiative, since the dissipation term \u2212J \u22c5 E covers the total current, while the E \u00d7 H definition has contributions from bound currents which are then excluded from the dissipation term.\nSince only the microscopic fields E and B occur in the derivation of S = (1/\"\u03bc\"0) E \u00d7 B and the energy density, assumptions about any material present are avoided. The Poynting vector and theorem and expression for energy density are universally valid in vacuum and all materials.\nTime-averaged Poynting vector.\nThe above form for the Poynting vector represents the \"instantaneous\" power flow due to \"instantaneous\" electric and magnetic fields. More commonly, problems in electromagnetics are solved in terms of sinusoidally varying fields at a specified frequency. The results can then be applied more generally, for instance, by representing incoherent radiation as a superposition of such waves at different frequencies and with fluctuating amplitudes.\nWe would thus not be considering the instantaneous E(\"t\") and H(\"t\") used above, but rather a complex (vector) amplitude for each which describes a coherent wave's phase (as well as amplitude) using phasor notation. These complex amplitude vectors are \"not\" functions of time, as they are understood to refer to oscillations over all time. A phasor such as Em is understood to signify a sinusoidally varying field whose instantaneous amplitude E(\"t\") follows the real part of Em\u2009\"ej\u03c9t\" where \u03c9 is the (radian) frequency of the sinusoidal wave being considered.\nIn the time domain, it will be seen that the instantaneous power flow will be fluctuating at a frequency of 2\"\u03c9\". But what is normally of interest is the \"average\" power flow in which those fluctuations are not considered. In the math below, this is accomplished by integrating over a full cycle \"T\" = 2\"\u03c0\" / \"\u03c9\". The following quantity, still referred to as a \"Poynting vector\", is expressed directly in terms of the phasors as:\nformula_29\nwhere \u2217 denotes the complex conjugate. The time-averaged power flow (according to the instantaneous Poynting vector averaged over a full cycle, for instance) is then given by the \"real part\" of Sm. The imaginary part is usually ignored, however, it signifies \"reactive power\" such as the interference due to a standing wave or the near field of an antenna. In a single electromagnetic plane wave (rather than a standing wave which can be described as two such waves travelling in opposite directions), E and H are exactly in phase, so Sm is simply a real number according to the above definition.\nThe equivalence of Re(Sm) to the time-average of the \"instantaneous\" Poynting vector S can be shown as follows.\nformula_30\nThe average of the instantaneous Poynting vector S over time is given by:\nformula_31\nThe second term is the double-frequency component having an average value of zero, so we find:\nformula_32\nAccording to some conventions, the factor of 1/2 in the above definition may be left out. Multiplication by 1/2 is required to properly describe the power flow since the magnitudes of Em and Hm refer to the \"peak\" fields of the oscillating quantities. If rather the fields are described in terms of their root mean square (RMS) values (which are each smaller by the factor formula_33), then the correct average power flow is obtained without multiplication by 1/2.\nResistive dissipation.\nIf a conductor has significant resistance, then, near the surface of that conductor, the Poynting vector would be tilted toward and impinge upon the conductor.figs.7,8 Once the Poynting vector enters the conductor, it is bent to a direction that is almost perpendicular to the surface.61 This is a consequence of Snell's law and the very slow speed of light inside a conductor. The definition and computation of the speed of light in a conductor can be given.402 Inside the conductor, the Poynting vector represents energy flow from the electromagnetic field into the wire, producing resistive Joule heating in the wire. For a derivation that starts with Snell's law see Reitz page 454.454\nRadiation pressure.\nThe density of the linear momentum of the electromagnetic field is \"S\"/\"c\"2 where \"S\" is the magnitude of the Poynting vector and \"c\" is the speed of light in free space. The radiation pressure exerted by an electromagnetic wave on the surface of a target is given by\nformula_34\nUniqueness of the Poynting vector.\nThe Poynting vector occurs in Poynting's theorem only through its divergence \u2207 \u22c5 S, that is, it is only required that the surface integral of the Poynting vector around a closed surface describe the net flow of electromagnetic energy into or out of the enclosed volume. This means that adding a solenoidal vector field (one with zero divergence) to S will result in another field that satisfies this required property of a Poynting vector field according to Poynting's theorem. Since the divergence of any curl is zero, one can add the curl of any vector field to the Poynting vector and the resulting vector field S\u2032 will still satisfy Poynting's theorem.\nHowever even though the Poynting vector was originally formulated only for the sake of Poynting's theorem in which only its divergence appears, it turns out that the above choice of its form \"is\" unique. The following section gives an example which illustrates why it is \"not\" acceptable to add an arbitrary solenoidal field to E \u00d7 H.\nStatic fields.\nThe consideration of the Poynting vector in static fields shows the relativistic nature of the Maxwell equations and allows a better understanding of the magnetic component of the Lorentz force, \"q\"(v \u00d7 B). To illustrate, the accompanying picture is considered, which describes the Poynting vector in a cylindrical capacitor, which is located in an H field (pointing into the page) generated by a permanent magnet. Although there are only static electric and magnetic fields, the calculation of the Poynting vector produces a clockwise circular flow of electromagnetic energy, with no beginning or end.\nWhile the circulating energy flow may seem unphysical, its existence is necessary to maintain conservation of angular momentum. The momentum of an electromagnetic wave in free space is equal to its power divided by \"c\", the speed of light. Therefore, the circular flow of electromagnetic energy implies an \"angular\" momentum. If one were to connect a wire between the two plates of the charged capacitor, then there would be a Lorentz force on that wire while the capacitor is discharging due to the discharge current and the crossed magnetic field; that force would be circumferential to the central axis and thus add angular momentum to the system. That angular momentum would match the \"hidden\" angular momentum, revealed by the Poynting vector, circulating before the capacitor was discharged.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The heart of La Habana Province, Havana is the country's main port and commercial center. It is the most populous city, the largest by area, and the second largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean region. The population in 2021 was inhabitants, and its area is for the capital city side and 8,475.57\u00a0km2 for the metropolitan zone. Its official population was 1,749,964 inhabitants in 2024.\nHavana was founded by the Spanish in the 16th century. It served as a springboard for the Spanish conquest of the Americas, becoming a stopping point for Spanish galleons returning to Spain. King Philip III of Spain granted Havana the title of capital in 1607. Walls and forts were built to protect the city. The city is the seat of the Cuban government and various ministries, and headquarters of businesses and over 100 diplomatic offices. The governor is Reinaldo Garc\u00eda Zapata of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC). In 2009, the city/province had the third-highest income in the country.\nContemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one: Old Havana, Vedado and the newer suburban districts. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: Marimelena, Guanabacoa and Antares. The Almendares River traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.\nThe city attracts over amillion tourists annually; (1,176,627 international tourists in 2010, a 20% increase from 2005). Old Havana was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. The city is also noted for its history, culture, architecture and monuments. As typical of Cuba, Havana experiences a tropical climate.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nIn 1514, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez founded the city San Crist\u00f3bal de la Habana, which means \"Saint Christopher of the Habana\". It has been theorized that the name is derived from Habaguanex, who was the chief of a local Ta\u00edno-speaking Native American people group about whom nothing else is known. When Habana was adapted into English, the \u27e8b\u27e9 was switched to a \u27e8v\u27e9 because of a linguistic phenomenon known as betacism, which is an assimilation of the voiced bilabial plosive and voiced labiodental fricative sounds that occurs in most modern Spanish dialects. Usage of the word \"Havana\" in literature understandably peaked during the Spanish\u2013American War, but it also represents a type of cigar, a color, and a type of rabbit as well as the city. Havana is the prevailing name for the city found in English-language dictionaries.\nHistory.\n16th century.\nDiego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar founded Havana in 1514, on the southern coast of the island, near the present town of Surgidero de Bataban\u00f3 on the banks of the Mayabeque River close to Playa Mayabeque. All attempts to found a city on Cuba's south coast failed, however; an early map of Cuba drawn in 1514 places the town at the mouth of the river.\nBetween 1514 and 1519 the Spanish established two settlements on the north coast, one of them in \"La Chorrera\", around the site of the Torre\u00f3n de la Chorrera, what eventually became the neighborhoods of Vedado and Miramar, next to the mouth of the Almendares River. The town that became Havana originated adjacent to what was then called \"Puerto de Carenas\" (literally, \"Careening Port\"), in 1519. The quality of this natural bay, which now hosts Havana's harbor, warranted this change of location.\nP\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez gave Havana \u2013 the sixth town founded by the Spanish on Cuba \u2013 its name: \"San Crist\u00f3bal de la Habana\". The name combines \"San Crist\u00f3bal\", patron saint of Havana. Shortly after the founding of Cuba's first cities, the island served as little more than a base for the \"Conquista\" of other lands.\nHavana began as a trading port, and suffered regular attacks by buccaneers, pirates, and French corsairs. The first attack and resultant burning of the city was by the French corsair Jacques de Sores in 1555. Such attacks convinced the Spanish Crown to fund the construction of the first fortresses in the main cities \u2013 not only to counteract the pirates and corsairs, but also to exert more control over commerce with the West Indies, and to limit the extensive \"contrabando\" (black market) that had arisen due to the trade restrictions imposed by the \"Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n\" of Seville (the crown-controlled trading house that held a monopoly on New World trade).\nShips from all over the New World carried products first to Havana, to be taken by the fleet to Spain. The thousands of ships gathered in the city's bay also fueled Havana's agriculture and manufacture, since they had to be supplied with food, water, and other products needed to traverse the ocean.\nOn 20 December 1592, King Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of City. Later on, the city would be officially designated as \"Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies\" by the Spanish Crown. In the meantime, efforts to build or improve the defensive infrastructures of the city continued.\n17th century.\nHavana expanded greatly in the 17th century. New buildings were constructed from the most abundant materials of the island, mainly wood, combining various Iberian architectural styles, as well as borrowing profusely from Canarian characteristics. During this period the city also built civic monuments and religious constructions. The convent of St Augustin, El Morro Castle, the chapel of the Humilladero, the fountain of Dorotea de la Luna in La Chorrera, the church of the Holy Angel, the hospital de San L\u00e1zaro, the monastery of Santa Teresa and the convent of San Felipe Neri were completed in this era.\nIn 1649 a fatal epidemic, brought from Cartagena in Colombia, affected a third of the population of Havana. In 1674, the works for the City Walls were started, as part of the fortification efforts. They would be completed by 1740.\nBy the middle of the 18th century, Havana had more than seventy thousand inhabitants, and was the third-largest city in the Americas, ranking behind Lima and Mexico City but ahead of Boston and New York City.\n18th century.\nDuring the 18th century Havana was the most important of the Spanish ports because it had facilities where ships could be refitted and, by 1740, it had become Spain's largest and most active shipyard and only drydock in the New World.\nThe city was captured by the British during the Seven Years' War. The episode began on 6 June 1762, when at dawn, a British fleet, comprising more than 50 ships and a combined force of over 11,000 men of the Royal Navy and Army, sailed into Cuban waters and made an amphibious landing east of Havana. The British immediately opened up trade with their North American and Caribbean colonies, causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. Less than a year after Havana was seized, the Peace of Paris was signed by the three warring powers thus ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain Florida in exchange for the return of the city of Havana on to Spain.\nAfter regaining the city, the Spanish transformed Havana into the most heavily fortified city in the Americas like Cartagena, Colombia a city that under the leadership of Blas de Lezo defeated a British invasion of 30,000 sailors. Construction began on what was to become the Fortress of San Carlos de la Caba\u00f1a, the third biggest Spanish fortification in the New World after Castillo San Crist\u00f3bal (the biggest) and Castillo San Felipe del Morro both in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On 15 January 1796, the remains of Christopher Columbus were transported to the island from Santo Domingo. They rested there until 1898, when they were transferred to Seville's Cathedral, after Spain's loss of Cuba.\n19th century.\nAs trade between Caribbean and North American states increased in the early 19th century, Havana became a flourishing and fashionable city. Havana's theaters featured the most distinguished actors of the age, and prosperity among the burgeoning middle-class led to expensive new classical mansions being erected. During this period Havana became known as the Paris of the Antilles. \nIn 1837, the first railroad was constructed, a stretch between Havana and Bejucal, which was used for transporting sugar from the valley of G\u00fcines to the harbor. With this, Cuba became the fifth country in the world to have a railroad, and the first Spanish-speaking country. Throughout the century, Havana was enriched by the construction of additional cultural facilities, such as the Tac\u00f3n Theatre, one of the most luxurious in the world. The fact that slavery was legal in Cuba until 1886 led to Southern American interest, including a plan by the Knights of the Golden Circle to create a 'Golden Circle' with a 1200mile-radius centered on Havana. After the Confederate States of America were defeated in the American Civil War in 1865, many former slaveholders continued to run plantations by moving to Havana. \nIn 1863, the city walls were knocked down so that the metropolis could be enlarged. At the end of the 19th century, Havana witnessed the final moments of Spanish presence in the Americas.\nThe sinking of the U.S. battleship \"Maine\" in Havana's harbor in 1898 was the immediate cause of the Spanish\u2013American War.\n20th century.\nCuba's first presidential period under Tom\u00e1s Estrada Palma from 1902 to 1906 was considered to uphold the highest standards of administrative integrity in the history of the Republic of Cuba. \nWhile Cuba had the highest ratio of hospital beds to population in the Caribbean, around 80% of these beds were located in the city of Havana, there was only one rural hospital and it was equipped with only 10 beds. In July 1940, during World War II, the Havana Conference was held and 21 American nations, including the host country Cuba, agreed to govern their own territories that were occupied by the Axis powers.\nIn 1958, Cuba was a relatively well-advanced country by Caribbean standards, and in some cases by world standards. Cuba was affected by perhaps the largest labor union privileges in the Americas, including bans on dismissals and mechanization. They were obtained in large measure \"at the cost of the unemployed and the peasants\", leading to disparities. Between 1933 and 1958, Cuba extended economic regulations enormously, causing economic problems. Unemployment became a problem as graduates entering the workforce could not find jobs. The middle class, which was comparable to that of the United States, became increasingly dissatisfied with unemployment and political persecution. The labor unions supported Batista until the very end. Batista stayed in power until he was forced into exile in December 1958.\nAfter the revolution of 1959, the new government under Fidel Castro began to improve social services, public housing, and official buildings. Nevertheless, after Castro's abrupt expropriation of all private property and industry (May 1959 onwards) under a strong communist model backed by the Soviet Union followed by the U.S. embargo, shortages that affected Cuba in general hit Havana especially hard. By 1966\u201368, the Cuban government had nationalized all privately owned business entities in Cuba, down to \"certain kinds of small retail forms of commerce\" as per law No. 1076.\nAn economic downturn occurred after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Soviet subsidies ended, representing billions of dollars that the Soviet Union had given the Cuban government. Many believed the revolutionary government would soon collapse, as happened to the Soviet satellite states of Eastern Europe.\n21st century.\nTourism in Cuba has brought foreign investors to remodel the nationalized, former Manzana de Gomez building, and turn it into the Gran Hotel Manzana Kempinski La Habana, a new 5-star hotel attempting to develop a new hospitality industry. In Old Havana, a number of streets and squares have been rehabilitated in an effort to rebuild for tourists. But Old Havana is a large city, and the restoration efforts concentrate in all on less than 10% of its area.\nOn the night of 27 January 2019, an unusually violent and destructive tornado ripped through Havana. The tornado killed eight people and injured over 190. It was assigned an official rating of EF4 on the Enhanced Fujita scale by the Cuban Meteorology Institute, making this the first F4 or EF4 tornado in Cuba since 1940.\nAdministration.\nSpanish Colony (1550 - 1601).\nThe Havana City Council first started in 1550.\nIn 1557, the Council voted to ban all freed black men from owning taverns, inns, selling tabaco, or wine.\nCaptaincy General (1550 - 1898).\nUnder the Captaincy General of Cuba, the Havana City Council existed.\nRepublic of Cuba (1901 - 1959).\nAfter the Cuban War of Independence, Cuba created a new constitution in 1901. The Havana City Council was re-inaugrated on July 2, 1901. Alfredo Zayas was briefly appointed mayor, followed by the installment of Miguel Gener y Rinc\u00f3n, the acting Secretary of Justice of Cuba, after winning the 1900 Cuban local elections.\nIn 1902, pending an investigation by Emilio N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Gener was removed as mayor of Havana by Leonard Wood, after a vote of twenty-three out of twenty-five members of the City Council requested him to do so.\n1959 - 1989.\nUnder the Communist administration, the administrative makeup of the city was re-structured.\nModern era.\nThe governor is Yanet Hern\u00e1ndez P\u00e9rez, she was elected on 28 May 2023.\nThe city is administered by a city-provincial council, with a governor as chief administrative officer, thus Havana functions as both a city and a province of Cuba. The city has little autonomy and is dependent upon the national government, particularly, for much of its budgetary and overall political direction.\nVoters elect delegates to Municipal Assemblies in competitive elections every five years, and the Municipal Assemblies are responsible for each of the city's boroughs. These assemblies elect the borough presidents and vice presidents, which are equivalents to mayors and vice mayors in the other provinces. There is only one political party, the Communist Party, but since there must be a minimum of two candidates, members of the Communist Party often run against each other. Candidates are not required to be members of the party. They are nominated directly by citizens in open meetings within each election district. Municipal Assembly delegates within the boroughs in turn elect members of the Provincial Council (until 2019 the Provincial Assembly), which in Havana serves roughly as the City Council; its president appoints the Governor and Vice Governor, who serve as the Mayor and Vice Mayor of Havana and can be either elected by the council or appointed by the president with council confirmation. There are direct elections for the city's deputies to the National Assembly based on slates, and a portion of the candidates is nominated at the local level. The People's Councils (Consejos Populares) consist of local city delegates who elect a full-time representative to preside over the body. These councils are directly responsible for the city's neighbourhoods and wards. In addition, there is involvement of \"mass organizations\" and representatives of local government agencies, industries and services. The 105 People's Councils in Havana cover an average of 20,000 residents.\nHavana city borders are contiguous with the Mayabeque Province on the south and east and to Artemisa Province on the west, since former La Habana Province (rural) was abolished in 2010.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nHavana lies on the northern coast of Cuba along the Straits of Florida, south of the Florida Keys, where the Gulf of Mexico joins the Atlantic Ocean. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: Marimelena, Guanabacoa, and Atar\u00e9s. The Almendares River traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.\nThere are low hills on which the city lies rise gently from the waters of the straits. A noteworthy elevation is the 200-foot-high (60-meter) limestone ridge that slopes up from the east and culminates in the heights of La Caba\u00f1a and El Morro, the sites of Spanish fortifications overlooking the eastern bay. Another notable rise is the hill to the west that is occupied by the University of Havana and the Castillo del Pr\u00edncipe (Havana).\nClimate.\nHavana has a tropical climate that is tempered by the island's position in the belt of the trade winds and by the warm offshore currents. Under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Havana has a tropical savanna climate (\"Aw\") that closely borders on a tropical rainforest climate (\"Af\") and a tropical monsoon climate (\"Am\"). Average temperatures range from in January and February to in August. The temperature seldom drops below . The lowest temperature was in Santiago de Las Vegas, Boyeros. The lowest recorded temperature in Cuba was in Bainoa, Mayabeque Province (before 2011 the eastern part of Havana province). Rainfall is heaviest in June and October and lightest from December through April, averaging annually. Hurricanes occasionally strike the island, but they ordinarily hit the south coast, and damage in Havana has been less than elsewhere in the country. The most recent tropical cyclone to come near Havana at hurricane strength was Ian in 2022.\nTornadoes can be somewhat rare in Cuba. Nonetheless, on the evening of 28 January 2019, a very rare strong EF4 tornado struck the eastern side of Havana. The tornado caused extensive damage, destroying at least 90 homes, killing four people and injuring 195. By 4 February the death toll had increased to six, with 11 people still in critical condition.\nThe table lists temperature averages:\nMunicipalities.\nThe city is divided into 15 municipalities \u2013 or \"boroughs\", which are further subdivided into 105 \"consejos populares\" (wards)\nDemography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBy the end of 2012 official Census, 19.1% of the population of Cuba lived in Havana. According to the census of 2012, the population was 2,106,146. The city has an average life expectancy of 76.81 years at birth. \nHavana agglomeration grew rapidly during the first half of the 20th century reaching 1million inhabitants in the 1943 census. The con-urbanization expanded over the Havana municipality borders into neighbor municipalities of Marianao, Regla and Guanabacoa. Starting from the 1980s, the city's population is growing slowly as a result of balanced development policies, low birth rate, its relatively high rate of emigration abroad, and controlled domestic migration. Because of the city and country's low birth rate and high life expectancy, its age structure is similar to a developed country, with Havana having an even higher proportion of elderly than the country as a whole.\nEthnic breakdown.\nAccording to the 2012 national census of Havana's population (the Cuban census and similar studies use the term \"skin color\" instead of \"race\").\nAs with the other Caribbean nations, there are few mestizos in Havana (and Cuba as a whole), in contrast to many other countries, because the indigenous Ta\u00edno population was virtually wiped out by Eurasian diseases in the earliest period of the Spanish conquest.\nThe Cuban government controls the movement of people into Havana on the grounds that the Havana metropolitan area (home to nearly 20% of the country's population) is overstretched in terms of land use, water, electricity, transportation, and other elements of the urban infrastructure. There is a population of internal migrants to Havana nicknamed \"palestinos\" (Palestinians) who mostly hail from the eastern region of Oriente.\nThe city's significant minority of Chinese, mostly of Cantonese origin, were brought in the mid-19th century by Spanish settlers via the Philippines with work contracts and after completing 8-year contracts many Chinese immigrants settled permanently in Havana. Before the revolution the Chinese population counted to over 200,000, today, Chinese ancestors could count up to 100,000. Chinese born/ native Chinese (mostly Cantonese as well) are around 400 presently. There are some 3,000 Russians living in the city; as reported by the Russian Embassy in Havana, most are women married to Cubans who had studied in the Soviet Union. Havana also shelters other non-Cuban population of an unknown size. There is a population of several thousand North African teen and pre-teen refugees.\nBetween 2018, the most recent census, and the mid-Twentieth Century census of 1953, Havana's population has grown by an estimated 87 percent, a growth rate typical of most Caribbean cities.\nReligion.\nRoman Catholics form the largest religious group in Havana. Havana is one of the three Metropolitan sees on the island (the others being Camag\u00fcey and Santiago), with two suffragan bishoprics: Matanzas and Pinar del R\u00edo. Its patron saint is San Crist\u00f3bal (Saint Christopher), to whom the cathedral is devoted. it also has a minor basilica, Bas\u00edlica Santuario Nacional de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Caridad del Cobre and two other national shrines, Jes\u00fas Nazareno del Rescate and San L\u00e1zaro (El Rinc\u00f3n). It received papal visits from three successive supreme pontiffs: Pope John Paul II (January 1998), Pope Benedict XVI (March 2012) and Pope Francis (September 2015).\nThe Jewish community in Havana has reduced after the Revolution from once having embraced more than 15,000 Jews, many of whom had fled Nazi persecution and subsequently left Cuba to Miami or to Israel after Castro took to power in 1959. The city once had five synagogues, but only three remain (one Orthodox, and two Conservative: one Conservative Ashkenazi and one Conservative Sephardic), Beth Shalom Grand Synagogue is one of them and another that is a hybrid of all 3 put together. In February 2007 the New York Times estimated that there were about 1,500 known Jews living in Havana.\nEconomy.\nHavana has a diversified economy, with traditional sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, transportation and communications, and new or revived ones such as biotechnology and tourism.\nThe city's economy first developed on the basis of its location, which made it one of the early great trade centers in the New World. Sugar and a flourishing slave trade first brought riches to the city, and later, after independence, it became a renowned resort. Despite efforts by Fidel Castro's government to spread Cuba's industrial activity to all parts of the island, Havana remains the center of much of the nation's industry.\nThe traditional sugar industry, upon which the island's economy has been based for three centuries, is centered elsewhere on the island and controls some three-fourths of the export economy. But light manufacturing facilities, meat-packing plants, and chemical and pharmaceutical operations are concentrated in Havana. Other food-processing industries are also important, along with shipbuilding, vehicle manufacturing, production of alcoholic beverages (particularly rum), textiles, and tobacco products, particularly the world-famous Habanos cigars. Although the harbors of Cienfuegos and Matanzas, in particular, have been developed under the revolutionary government, Havana remains Cuba's primary port facility; 50% of Cuban imports and exports pass through Havana. The port also supports a considerable fishing industry.\nIn 2000, nearly 89% of the city's officially recorded labor force worked for government-run agencies, institutions or enterprises. Havana, on average, has the country's highest incomes and human development indicators. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba re-emphasized tourism as a major industry leading to its recovery. Tourism is now Havana and Cuba's primary economic source.\nHavana's economy is still in flux, despite Ra\u00fal Castro's embrace of free enterprise in 2011. Though there was an uptick in small businesses in 2011, many have since gone out of business, due to lack of business and income on the part of the local residents, whose salaries average $20 per month.\nCommerce and finance.\nAfter the Revolution, Cuba's traditional capitalist free-enterprise system was replaced by a heavily socialized economic system. In Havana, Cuban-owned businesses and U.S.-owned businesses were nationalized and today most businesses operate solely under state control.\nIn Old Havana and throughout Vedado there are several small private businesses, such as shoe-repair shops or dressmaking facilities. Banking as well is also under state control, and the National Bank of Cuba, headquartered in Havana, is the control center of the Cuban economy. Its branches in some cases occupy buildings that were in pre-revolutionary times the offices of Cuban or foreign banks.\nIn the late 1990s Vedado, located along the Atlantic waterfront, started to represent the principal commercial area. It was developed extensively between 1930 and 1960, when Havana developed as a major destination for U.S. tourists; high-rise hotels, casinos, restaurants, and upscale commercial establishments, many reflecting the art deco style.\nVedado is today Havana's financial district, and the main banks, airline companies offices, shops, most businesses headquarters, numerous high-rise apartments and hotels, are located in the area. The University of Havana is located in Vedado.\nTourism.\nThe city has long been a popular attraction for tourists. Between 1915 and 1930, Havana hosted more tourists than any other location in the Caribbean. The influx was due in large part to Cuba's proximity to the United States, where restrictive prohibition on alcohol and other pastimes stood in stark contrast to the island's traditionally relaxed attitude to leisure pursuits. A pamphlet published by E.C. Kropp Co., Milwaukee, WI, between 1921 and 1939 promoting tourism in Havana, Cuba, can be found in the University of Houston Digital Library, Havana, Cuba, The Summer Land of the World, Digital Collection.\nWith the deterioration of Cuba \u2013 United States relations and the imposition of the trade embargo on the island in 1961, tourism dropped drastically and did not return to anything close to its pre-revolution levels until 1989. The revolutionary government in general, and Fidel Castro in particular, opposed any considerable development of tourism. In 1982, the Cuban government passed a foreign investment code that opened a number of sectors to foreign capital.\nThrough the creation of firms open to such foreign investment (such as \"Cubanacan\"), Cuba began to attract capital for hotel development, managing to increase the number of tourists from 130,000 (in 1980) to 326,000 (by the end of that decade).\nHavana has also been a popular health tourism destination for more than 20 years. Foreign patients travel to Cuba, Havana in particular, for a wide range of treatments including eye-surgery, neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, and orthopedics. Many patients are from Latin America, although medical treatment for retinitis pigmentosa, often known as night blindness, has attracted many patients from Europe and North America.\nHavana attracts over amillion tourists annually, the Official Census for Havana reports that in 2010 the city was visited by 1,176,627 international tourists, a 20% increase from 2005.\nPoverty and slums.\nThe years after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the city, and Cuba in general have suffered decades of economic deterioration, including Special Period of the 1990s. The national government does not have an official definition of poverty. The government researchers argue that \"poverty\" in most commonly accepted meanings does not really exist in Cuba, but rather that there is a sector of the population that can be described as \"at risk\" or \"vulnerable\" using internationally accepted measures.\nThe generic term \"slum\" is seldom used in Cuba, substandard housing is described: housing type, housing conditions, building materials, and settlement type. The National Housing Institute considers units in \"solares\" (a large inner-city mansion or older hotel or boarding house subdivided into rooms, sometimes with over 60 families) and shanty towns to be the \"precarious housing stock\" and tracks their number. Most slum units are concentrated in the inner-city municipalities of Old Havana and Centro Habana, as well as such neighborhoods as \"Atar\u00e9s\" in Regla. People living in slums have access to the same education, health care, job opportunities and social security as those who live in formerly privileged neighborhoods. Shanty towns are scattered throughout the city except for in a few central areas.\nOver 9% of Havana's population live in \"cuarter\u00eda\" (\"solares, ciudadela\"), 3.3% in shanty towns, and 0.3% in refugee shelters. This does not include an estimate of the number of people living in housing in \"fair\" or \"poor\" condition because in many cases these units do not necessarily constitute slum housing but rather are basically sound dwellings needing repairs. According to \"Instituto Nacional de Vivienda\" (National Housing Institute) official figures, in 2001, 64% of Havana's 586,768 units were considered in \"good\" condition, up from 50% in 1990. Some 20% were in \"fair\" condition and 16% in \"poor\" condition. Partial or total building collapses are not uncommon, although the number had been cut in half by the end of the 1990s as the worst units disappeared and others were repaired. Buildings in Old Havana and Centro Habana are especially exposed to the elements: high humidity, the corrosive effects of salt spray from proximity to the coast, and occasional flooding. Most areas of the city, especially the highly populated districts, are in urban decay.\nTransport.\nAirports.\nHavana is served by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport. The Airport lies about south of the city center, in the municipality of Boyeros, and is the main hub for the country's flag carrier Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n. The airport is Cuba's main international and domestic gateway, it connects Havana with the rest of the Caribbean, North, Central and South America, Europe and one destination in Africa.\nThe city is also served by Playa Baracoa Airport, a small airport to the west of city used for some domestic flights, primarily Aerogaviota.\nRail.\nHavana has a network of suburban, interurban and long-distance rail lines. The railways are nationalized and run by the FFCC (Ferrocarriles de Cuba \u2013 Railways of Cuba). The FFCC connects Havana with all the provinces of Cuba, and the Havana Suburban Railway serves the city. The main railway stations are: Central Rail Station, La Coubre Rail Station, Casablanca Station, and Estaci\u00f3n de Tulip\u00e1n.\nIn 2004 the annual passenger volume was some 11million, but demand is estimated at two-and-a-half to three times this value, with the busiest route being between Havana and Santiago de Cuba, some apart by rail. In 2000 the Union de Ferrocarriles de Cuba bought French first class airconditioned coaches. New Chinese made and Russian made coaches for distance trains debuted in the 2010s, and some now serve suburban services.\nIn the 1980s there were plans for a Metro system in Havana similar to Moscow's, as a result of the Soviet Union influence in Cuba at the time. The studies of geology and finance made by Cuban, Czech and Soviet specialists were already well advanced in the 1980s. The Cuban press showed the construction project and the course route, linking municipalities and neighborhoods in the capital. In the late 1980s the project had already begun, each mile (1.6km) of track was worth a million dollars at the time, but with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 the project was later dropped.\nInterurban.\nAn interurban line, known as the Hershey Electric Railway, built in 1917 runs from Casablanca (across the harbor from Old Havana) to Hershey and on to Matanzas.\nTramway.\nHavana operated a tram system until 1952, which began as a horsecar system, Ferro Carril Urbano de la Habana in 1858, merged with rival coach operator in 1863 as Empresa del Ferro-Carril Urbano y Omnibus de La Habana and later electrified in 1900 under new foreign owners as Havana Electric Railway Company. Ridership decline resulted in bankruptcy in 1950 with new owner Autobus Modernos SA abandoning the systems in favor of buses and the remaining cars were sold to Matanzas in 1952.\nRoads.\nThe city's road network is quite extensive, and has broad avenues, main streets and major access roads to the city such as the Autopista Nacional (A1), Carretera Central and Via Blanca. The road network has been under construction and growth since the Spanish era but is undergoing a major deterioration due to low maintenance.\nMotorways (autopistas) include:\nEducation.\nThe national government assumes all responsibility for education, and there are adequate primary, secondary, and vocational training schools throughout Cuba. The schools are of varying quality and education is free and compulsory at all levels except higher learning, which is also free.\nThe University of Havana, located in the Vedado section of Havana, was established in 1728 and was regarded as a leading institution of higher learning in the Western Hemisphere. Soon after the Revolution, the university, as well as all other educational institutions, were nationalized. Since then several other universities have opened, like the Higher Learning Polytechnic Institute Jos\u00e9 Antonio Echeverr\u00eda where the vast majority of today's Cuban engineers are taught.\nThe Cuban National Ballet School with 4,350 students is one of the largest ballet schools in the world and the most prestigious ballet school in Cuba.\nCulture.\nSymbols.\nThe coat of arms of Havana consists of three castles that represent the three castles that defended the city: the Fuerza Castle, the Morro Castle and the Punta Castle. The key represents that Havana was the gateway to the New World. The shield, supported by an oak branch on one side and a laurel wreath on the other, symbolizes the strength of the nation, the laurel wreath, honor, and glory. These symbols represent the rights of man.\nArchitecture.\nHavana has diverse styles of architecture, from castles built in the 16th century, to modernist high-rise buildings.\nThe present condition of many structures have deteriorated since 1959 or have been demolished, including the demolition of the Plaza del Vapor, built in 1835 by the architect of the Palacio de la Marquesa de Villalba, Eugenio Rayneri Sorrentino, the father of Eugenio Rayneri Piedra the architect of the El Capitolio of 1929. The Plaza del Vapor was demolished in 1959 by the new, revolutionary government. Numerous building collapses throughout the city have resulted in injuries and deaths due to a lack of maintenance.\nSpanish.\nRiches were brought from the Spanish into and through Havana as it was a key transshipment point between the New World and Old World. As a result, Havana was the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Most examples of early architecture can be seen in military fortifications such as La Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabana (1558\u20131577) designed by Battista Antonelli and the Castillo del Morro (1589\u20131630). This sits at the entrance of Havana Bay and provides an insight into the supremacy and wealth at that time.\nOld Havana was also protected by a defensive wall begun in 1674 but had already overgrown its boundaries when it was completed in 1767, becoming the new neighborhood of Centro Habana. The influence from different styles and cultures can be seen in Havana's Spanish architecture, with a diverse range of Mud\u00e9jar architecture, Spanish, Italian, Greek and Roman. The San Carlos and San Ambrosio Seminary (18th century) is a good example of early Spanish influenced architecture. The Havana cathedral (1748\u20131777) dominating the Plaza de la Catedral (1749) is the best example of Cuban Baroque. Surrounding it are the former palaces of the Count de Casa-Bayona (1720\u20131746) Marquis de Arcos (1746) and the Marquis de Aguas Claras (1751\u20131775).\nThe Iglesia del Esp\u00edritu Santo was devoted in 1638. The Esp\u00edritu Santo contains some notable paintings including a seated, post-crucifixion Christ on the right wall, and catacombs. It is considered one of the oldest temples in Havana and it is said that its main interest lies essentially in the simplicity of the beautiful stone construction. The church was rebuilt and expanded in 1648 and given the rank of a parish. During the Spanish era it had exceptional importance, since by a Papal Bull of 1772 and a Royal Certificate of 1773, of Charles III of Spain, it was declared \"\u00danica Iglesia inmune en esta ciudad, construida en 1855.\" (\"the only immune church in this city, built-in 1855.\"), which meant that any persecuted individual could find Amparo (sanctuary) in it against the action of the authorities or of justice. A metal plaque at the foot of the bell tower attests to this fact. The Iglesia del Esp\u00edritu Santo's greatest interest from an architectural point of view lies in the simplicity of the coral stone construction and the lack of lavish decoration. Other elements of great importance are the funerary crypts that were discovered in 1953. The crypt is from times before the Col\u00f3n Cemetery (1876) in El Vedado was built.\nThe Alameda de Paula was the first promenade in Cuba, designed and constructed in 1776 by Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez Trevejo, following the instructions of the Laureano de Torres y Ayala, it was created on the site of the old Rinc\u00f3n refuse dump. It was an embankment with two rows of poplar trees and some benches, it became one of Havana's most important social and cultural spaces, it was the model of the Paseo del Prado designed in 1925. It was given the name Alameda de Paula because of its proximity to the old Hospital and Iglesia of San Francisco de Paula. Between 1803 and 1805 the pavement was tiled, a fountain and stone benches, lampposts and the marble column were added, it qualified as a pleasant entertainment for the residents of the Villa de San Crist\u00f3bal, lacking recreational sites at that time. In 1841, the stairs that gave access to the promenade were widened and several lampposts were added. In the year 2000, the Havana promenade was restored and extended until it reached the Iglesia de San Francisco de Paula.\nTowards the end of the 17th century, the first stone of what would be the hospital for women and the church of San Francisco de Paula was placed, the buildings were expanded in 1731 with the support and donations from the City Council and orders of the different General Captains in command of the island. In 1776, it was the most important hospital in Havana, there were several generations of famous doctors that trained here. The Presbyter of the Cathedral of Havana, don Nicol\u00e1s Est\u00e9vez Borges, in 1664 ordered the construction of a Hospital for Women and an adjoining church devoted to Saint Francis of Paola who was one of the founders of the Roman Catholic Order of the Minims. Both buildings were completely destroyed by a hurricane in 1730 and were rebuilt and enlarged in 1745 in the Baroque style seen today.\nNeoclassical.\nNeoclassism was introduced into the city in the 1840s, at the time including Gas public lighting in 1848 and the railroad in 1837. In the second half of the 18th century, sugar and coffee production increased rapidly, which became essential in the development of Havana's most prominent architectural style. Many wealthy \"Habaneros\" took their inspiration from the French; this can be seen within the interiors of upper-class houses such as the \"Aldama Palace\" built in 1844. This is considered the most important neoclassical residential building in Cuba and typifies the design of many houses of this period with portales of neoclassical columns facing open spaces or courtyards.\nIn 1925 Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier, the head of urban planning in Paris moved to Havana for five years to collaborate with architects and landscape designers. In the master planning of the city his aim was to create a harmonic balance between the classical built form and the tropical landscape. He embraced and connected the city's road networks while accentuating prominent landmarks. His influence has left a huge mark on Havana although many of his ideas were cut short by the Great Depression in 1929. During the first decades of the 20th century Havana expanded more rapidly than at any time during its history. Great wealth prompted architectural styles to be influenced from abroad. The peak of Neoclassicism came with the construction of the Vedado district (begun in 1859). This area features a number of set back well-proportioned buildings in the Neoclassical style.\nBuilt in 1875, in the Reparto de las Las Murallas, (wide strip of land that remained after the city walls were demolished in 1863), it was the work of the architect Eugenio Rayneri y Sorrentino. Around 1880 the mansion was owned by the Count of Casa Mor\u00e9. The \"La Flor de Jos\u00e9 Murias\" tobacco factory was installed in the building. Later, through the exploitation of rents, it became a tenement house. In 1951 some of its spaces were dedicated to housing. On its upper floor, the Spanish Center and the Israeli Center of Cuba had their headquarters.\nThe palace of the Marquesa de Villalba and the Mercado de Tac\u00f3n were designed by the Eugenio Rayneri y Sorrentino at almost the same time, 1875 and 1876, respectively, each in a style that accommodated the particular typology (residential and commercial) thus conceiving each work with the formal element accommodating different aesthetic requirements. The property is, after the Aldama Palace, the strongest example of Cuban Neoclassicism. The palace of the Marquesa de Villalba is in the neoclassical style, perhaps only comparable in Havana \u2013 according to Alina Castellanos \u2013 to the Aldama Palace. But while the latter limits the decoration to the natural slenderness of the colonnade, in the most classical way of the Greek Parthenon, the former uses Roman and Renaissance elaborations, hence, the arcade has been projected on pillars, the building was crowned with a considerable cornice. The neoclassical decoration can also be seen in the window covers, which take alternate forms of a triangular or semicircular pediment, and glass over the door, similar to the Plaza del Vapor.\nThe Palacio de Aldama is a neoclassical mansion located diagonally opposite to the old Plaza del Vapor (Parque del Curita), and in front of the old Campo de Marte; present day Parque de la Fraternidad, in Havana, Cuba. Built in 1840 by the Dominican architect and engineer Manuel Jos\u00e9 Carrera, its main facade of columns spans one block on Calle Amistad between Calles Reina and Estrella.\nThe Royal Palm Hotel is located on the corner of San Rafael and Industria. It was inaugurated as \"Edificio Luis. E. del Valle\", in honor of the sugar magnate who owned the building. It was soon sold to Canadian Wilbur E. Todgham, however, who turned it into the famed Royal Palm Hotel. The commercial function of the ground floor has been preserved to date, taking advantage of its excellent location on Boulevard de San Rafael. Taking into account the architectural values of this building and its socio-cultural importance within the urban landscape in which it is located, the building received a major restoration in 2000, with the support of the Provincial Council of Seville, Spain.\nArt deco.\nThe Bacardi Building (\"Edificio Bacard\u00ed\") is Havana landmark designed by the architects Esteban Rodr\u00edguez-Castells and Rafael Fern\u00e1ndez Ruenes and completed in 1930. It is located on the corner of Calles Monserrate and San Juan de Dios on a 1,320sq meter lot in Las Murallas, Old Havana. The building is in the art deco style that was popular internationally in the early decades of the 20th century. The Bacardi Building was designed to be the headquarters for the Bacardi Rum Company; it was nationalized by the Castro government in the early 1960s. In 2001, the building was restored by an Italian construction firm. The interior retains the original decorations in marble and granite. It is regarded as one of the finest Art Deco buildings in Latin America.\nDesigned by the architect Ricardo Mira in 1929, who in 1941 designed La Moderna Poesia bookstore on Obispo Street for the same owner, the L\u00f3pez Serrano Building was the tallest residential building in Cuba until the construction of the FOCSA Building in 1956. The construction of the building was promoted by Jos\u00e9 Antonio L\u00f3pez Serrano, a publisher who ran La Moderna Poes\u00eda.\nModernism.\nKnown by buildings of high-quality, modernist architecture transformed much of the city. Examples are the Havana Hilton Hotel of (1958), the Radiocentro CMQ Building of 1955 by Mart\u00edn Dom\u00ednguez Esteban architect of the FOCSA Building in 1956, and the Edificio del Seguro M\u00e9dico, Havana by Antonio Quintana Simonetti.\nHotel Tryp Habana Libre is one of the larger hotels in Cuba, situated in Vedado, Havana. The hotel has 572 rooms in a 25-floor tower at Calle 23 (\"La Rampa\") and Calle L. Opened in 1958 as the Habana Hilton, the hotel famously served as the residence of Fidel Castro and other revolutionaries throughout 1959, after their capture of Havana. The Habana Hilton was constructed at a cost of $24million, under the personal auspices of President Fulgencio Batista. It was built as an investment by the Caja de Retiro y Asistencia Social de los Trabajadores Gastronomicos, the pension plan of the Cuban catering workers' union, with additional financing from the Banco de Fomento Agricola e Industrial de Cuba (BANFAIC). It was operated by the American Hilton Hotels International group and was designed by the well-known Los Angeles architect Welton Becket, who had previously designed the Beverly Hilton for the chain. Becket designed the 27-story Habana Hilton in collaboration with Havana-based architects Lin Arroyo, and Gabriela Men\u00e9ndez. Arroyo was the Minister of Public Works under Batista. The hotel was constructed by the Frederick Snare Corporation.\nThe Radiocentro CMQ Building complex is a former radio and television production facility and office building at the intersection of Calle L and La Rampa in El Vedado, Cuba. It was modeled after Raymond Hood's 1933 Rockefeller Center in New York City. With 1,650 seats, the theater first opened on 23 December 1947, under the name Teatro Warner Radiocentro, it was owned by brothers Goar and Abel Mestre. Today the building serves as the headquarters of the Cuban Institute of Radio and Television (ICRT). For the construction of this building, the Havana building authorities granted a permit in 1947 amending the ordinances that were then in effect in El Vedado prohibiting the construction of buildings of more than three storeys. This statute was modified six years later to expand the construction of up to four floors because many planners and owners claimed the need to authorize them to build taller buildings in the area.\nThe FOCSA Building is a residential block in the Vedado neighborhood of Havana, Cuba. It was named after the contracting company \"Fomento de Obras y Construcciones, Sociedad An\u00f3nima\", and the architects were Ernesto G\u00f3mez Sampera (1921\u20132004), Mercedes Diaz (his wife), and Mart\u00edn Dom\u00ednguez Esteban (1897\u20131970), who was the architect of the Radiocentro CMQ Building. The structural engineer was Luis S\u00e1enz Duplace, of the firm S\u00e1enz, Cancio &amp; Mart\u00edn, and professor of engineering at the University of Havana. The civil engineers were Bartolome Bestard and Manuel Padron. Gustavo Becquer and Fernando H. Meneses were the mechanical and electrical engineers, respectively. It is located on a site bordered by Calles 17 and M and Calles 19 and N in the Vedado.\n The Edificio Focsa (1956) represents Havana's economic dominance at the time. This 35-story complex was conceived and based on Corbusian ideas of a self-contained city within a city. It contained 400 apartments, garages, a school, a supermarket, and a restaurant on the top floor. This was the tallest high-strength concrete structure in the world at the time (using no steel frame).\nThe Edificio del Seguro M\u00e9dico is a commercial building in El Vedado, Havana. Built between 1955 and 1958, it was designed as a mixed use building for apartments and offices for the headquarters of the National Medical Insurance Company by Antonio Quintana Simonetti.\nCityscape.\nContemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one: Old Havana, Vedado, and the newer suburban districts. Old Havana, with its narrow streets and overhanging balconies, is the traditional center of part of Havana's commerce, industry, and entertainment, as well as being a residential area.\nTo the west a newer section, centered on the uptown area known as Vedado, has become the rival of Old Havana for commercial activity and nightlife. The \"Capitolio Nacional\" building marks the beginning of Centro Habana, a working-class neighborhood that lies between Vedado and Old Havana. Barrio Chino and the Real Fabrica de Tabacos Partag\u00e1s, one of Cuba's oldest cigar factories is located in the area.\nA third Havana is that of the more affluent residential and industrial districts that spread out mostly to the west. Among these is Marianao, one of the newer parts of the city, dating mainly from the 1920s. Some of the suburban exclusivity was lost after the revolution, many of the suburban homes having been nationalized by the Cuban government to serve as schools, hospitals, and government offices. Several private country clubs were converted to public recreational centers. Miramar, located west of Vedado along the coast, remains Havana's exclusive area; mansions, foreign embassies, diplomatic residences, upscale shops, and facilities for wealthy foreigners are common in the area. The International School of Havana is located in the Miramar neighborhood.\nIn the 1980s many parts of Old Havana, including the Plaza de Armas, became part of a projected 35-yearmultimillion-dollar restoration project, for Cubans to appreciate their past and boost tourism. In the past ten years, with the assistance of foreign aid and under the support of local city historian Eusebio Leal Spengler, large parts of Habana Vieja have been renovated. The city is moving forward with their renovations, with most of the major plazas (Plaza Vieja, Plaza de la Catedral, Plaza de San Francisco and Plaza de Armas) and major tourist streets (Obispo and Mercaderes) near completion.\nVisual arts.\nThe Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana is a Fine Arts museum that exhibits Cuban and international art. The museum houses one of the largest collections of paintings and sculpture from Latin America and is the largest in the Caribbean region. Under the \"Cuban Ministry of Culture\", it occupies two locations in the vicinity of Havana's \"Paseo del Prado\", these are the \"Palace of Fine Arts\", devoted to Cuban art and the \"Palace of the Asturian Center\", dedicated to universal art. Its artistic heritage is made up of over 45,000 pieces. Since 1995 the capital hosts the headquarters of the Ludwig Foundation of Cuba in Vedado, founded by the German collectors Peter and Irene Ludwig, it is a non-governmental and non-profit organization for the dissemination and protection of Cuban art.\nNotable artists associated with the city include Federico Beltr\u00e1n Masses, V\u00edctor Manuel Garc\u00eda Vald\u00e9s, and Wifredo Lam.\nPerforming arts.\nFacing Havana's Central Park is the baroque Gran Teatro de La Habana, a prominent theater built in 1837. It is now home of the National Ballet of Cuba and the International Ballet Festival of Havana, one of the oldest in the New World. The fa\u00e7ade of the building is adorned with a stone and marble statue. There are also sculptural pieces by Giuseppe Moretti, representing allegories depicting benevolence, education, music and theater. The principal theater is the Garc\u00eda Lorca Auditorium, with seats for 1,500 and balconies. Glories of its rich history; the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso sang, the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova danced, and the French Sarah Bernhardt acted.\nAlicia Alonso was a Cuban \"prima ballerina assoluta\" and choreographer whose company became the Ballet Nacional de Cuba in 1955. Alonso was born \"on the outskirts\" of Havana in 1920 She is best known for her portrayals of Giselle and the ballet version of \"Carmen\".\nRadio and television.\nCMQ.\nCMQ was a Cuban radio and television station located in Havana, Cuba, reaching an audience in the 1940s and 1950s, attracting viewers and listeners with a program that ranged from music and news dissemination. It later expanded into radio and television networks. As a radio network it was a heated competitor of the RHC-Cadena Azul network.\nThe company was founded on March 12, 1933, by Miguel Gabriel and \u00c1ngel Camb\u00f3. Ten years later, on August 1, 1943, half of it was acquired by the business group of Goar Mestre. In the beginning, it transmitted only in the capital expanding later to the rest of the country.\nPre-revolutionary Cuba was an early adopter of new technology, including TV. Cuba was the first Latin American country to have television. In December 1946 station CM-21P conducted an experimental multi-point live broadcast.\nRegular commercial broadcasting began in October 1950 with Gaspar Pumarejo's Uni\u00f3n Radio TV. This was followed by Goar Mestre Espinosa's CMQ-TV on channel 6 on 18 December 1950. CMQ officially launched on 11 March 1951, and would become an NBC affiliate. By 1954, CMQ-TV had expanded into a seven station network. With the CMQ network, Cuba the second country in the world, only after the United States, to have a national TV network.\nAt the beginning of the 1950s with the transmission of the novel \"El Derecho de Nacer\", by Felix B. Caignet, displaced the competing station, RHC Cadena Azul. It is with this leadership that the second Cuban television channel, CMQ TV, Channel 6 is born. It was initially located on Calle Monte, on the corner of Paseo del Prado. On 12 March 1948, the radio studio was moved to the Radiocentro building in La Rampa and Calle L in El Vedado.\nFestivals.\nFilm Festival.\nThe Havana Film Festival is a Cuban festival that focuses on the promotion of Latin American filmmakers. It is also known in Spanish as \"Festival Internacional del Nuevo Cine Latinoamericano de La Habana,\" and in English as International Festival of New Latin American Cinema of Havana. It takes place every year during December in the city of Havana, Cuba.\nThe inaugural International Festival of New Latin American Cinema was held on 3 December 1979, and more than 600 film directors of Latin America responded to the first call made by the Cuban Institute of the Cinematographic Art and Industry (ICAIC). Its founders the included President of ICAIC, Alfredo Guevara, and the filmmakers Julio Garc\u00eda Espinosa and Pastor Vega.\nAs expressed in its founding convocation, the festival aimed to \"promote the regular meeting of Latin American filmmakers who with their work enrich the artistic culture of our countries (\u2026); ensure the joint presentation of fiction films, documentaries, cartoons and current events (\u2026), and contribute to the international diffusion and circulation of the main and most significant productions of our cinematographies\".\nIn 2013 the Havana Film Festival announced that it was reappointing Iv\u00e1n Giroud as its president. Giroud had previously served as president from 1994 to 2010.\nHealth.\nAll Cuban residents have free access to health care in hospitals, local polyclinics, and neighborhood family doctors who serve on average 170 families each, which is one of the highest doctor-to-patient ratio in the world. Nonetheless, the health system has suffered from shortages of supplies, equipment and medications caused by ending of the Soviet Union subsidies in the early 1990s and the US embargo. Nevertheless, Havana's infant mortality rate in 2009 was 4.9 per 1,000 live births, 5.12 in the country as a whole, which is lower than many developed nations, and the lowest in the developing world. Administration of the health care system for the nation is centered largely in Havana. Hospitals in Havana are run by the national government, and citizens are assigned hospitals and clinics to which they may go for attention.\nSports.\nMany Cubans are avid sports fans who particularly favor baseball. Havana's team in the Cuban National Series is Industriales, one of the most successful teams in the tournament. In the past, it has also been represented by Habana (in the pre-revolutionary Cuban League) as well as Metropolitanos and La Habana in the National Series.\nThe city has several large sports stadiums, the largest one being the Estadio Latinoamericano, where Industriales play. Admission to sporting events is generally free, and impromptu games are played in neighborhoods throughout the city. Social clubs at the beaches provide facilities for water sports and include restaurants and dance halls.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "49720", "revid": "40781349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49720", "title": "Robert Hooke", "text": "English polymath (1635\u20131703)\nRobert Hooke (; 18 July 1635\u00a0\u2013 3 March 1703) was an English polymath who was active as a physicist ('natural philosopher'), astronomer, geologist, meteorologist, and architect. He is credited as one of the first scientists to investigate living things at microscopic scale in 1665, using a compound microscope that he designed. Hooke was an impoverished scientific inquirer in young adulthood who went on to become one of the most important scientists of his time. After the Great Fire of London in 1666, Hooke (as a surveyor and architect) attained wealth and esteem by performing more than half of the property line surveys and assisting with the city's rapid reconstruction. Often vilified by writers in the centuries after his death, his reputation was restored at the end of the twentieth century and he has been called \"England's Leonardo [da Vinci]\".\nHooke was a Fellow of the Royal Society and from 1662, he was its first Curator of Experiments. From 1665 to 1703, he was also Professor of Geometry at Gresham College. Hooke began his scientific career as an assistant to the physical scientist Robert Boyle. Hooke built the vacuum pumps that were used in Boyle's experiments on gas law and also conducted experiments. In 1664, Hooke identified the rotations of Mars and Jupiter. Hooke's 1665 book \"Micrographia\", in which he coined the term \"cell\", encouraged microscopic investigations. Investigating optics\u00a0\u2013 specifically light refraction\u00a0\u2013 Hooke inferred a wave theory of light. His is the first-recorded hypothesis of the cause of the expansion of matter by heat, of air's composition by small particles in constant motion that thus generate its pressure, and of heat as energy.\nIn physics, Hooke inferred that gravity obeys an inverse square law and arguably was the first to hypothesise such a relation in planetary motion, a principle Isaac Newton furthered and formalised in Newton's law of universal gravitation. Priority over this insight contributed to the rivalry between Hooke and Newton. In geology and palaeontology, Hooke originated the theory of a terraqueous globe, thus disputing the Biblical view of the Earth's age; he also hypothesised the extinction of species, and argued hills and mountains had become elevated by geological processes. By identifying fossils of extinct species, Hooke presaged the theory of biological evolution.\nLife and works.\nEarly life.\nMuch of what is known of Hooke's early life comes from an autobiography he commenced in 1696 but never completed; Richard Waller FRS mentions it in his introduction to \"The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke, M.D. S.R.S.\", which was printed in 1705. The work of Waller, along with John Ward's \"Lives of the Gresham Professors\", and John Aubrey's \"Brief Lives\" form the major near-contemporaneous biographical accounts of his life.\nHooke was born in 1635 in Freshwater, Isle of Wight, to Cecily Gyles and the Anglican priest John Hooke, who was the curate of All Saints' Church, Freshwater. Robert was the youngest, by seven years, of four siblings (two boys and two girls); he was frail and not expected to live. Although his father gave him some instruction in English, (Latin) Grammar, and Divinity, Robert's education was largely neglected. Left to his own devices, he made little mechanical toys; seeing a brass clock dismantled, he built a wooden replica that \"would go\".\nHooke's father died in October 1648, leaving \u00a340 in his will to Robert (plus another \u00a310 held over from his grandmother). At the age of 13, he took this to London to become an apprentice to the celebrated painter Peter Lely. Hooke also had \"some instruction in drawing\" from the limner Samuel Cowper but \"the smell of the Oil Colours did not agree with his Constitution, increasing his Head-ache to which he was ever too much subject\", and he became a pupil at Westminster School, living with its master Richard Busby. Hooke quickly mastered Latin, Greek, and Euclid's \"Elements\"; he also learnt to play the organ and began his lifelong study of mechanics. He remained an accomplished draughtsman, as he was later to demonstrate in his drawings that illustrate the work of Robert Boyle and Hooke's own \"Micrographia\".\nOxford.\nIn 1653, Hooke secured a place at Christ Church, Oxford, receiving free tuition and accommodation as an organist and a chorister, and a basic income as a servitor, (despite the fact he did not officially matriculate until 1658.) In 1662, Hooke was awarded a Master of Arts degree.\nWhile a student at Oxford, Hooke was also employed as an assistant to Dr Thomas Willis\u00a0\u2013 a physician, chemist, and member of the Oxford Philosophical Club. The Philosophical Club had been founded by John Wilkins, Warden of Wadham College, who led this important group of scientists who went on to form the nucleus of the Royal Society. In 1659, Hooke described to the Club some elements of a method of heavier-than-air flight but concluded human muscles were insufficient to the task. Through the Club, Hooke met Seth Ward (the University's Savilian Professor of Astronomy) and developed for Ward a mechanism that improved the regularity of pendulum clocks used for astronomical time-keeping. Hooke characterised his Oxford days as the foundation of his lifelong passion for science. The friends he made there, particularly Christopher Wren, were important to him throughout his career. Willis introduced Hooke to Robert Boyle, who the Club sought to attract to Oxford.\nIn 1655, Boyle moved to Oxford and Hooke became nominally his assistant but in practice his co-experimenter. Boyle had been working on gas pressures; the possibility a vacuum might exist despite Aristotle's maxim \"Nature abhors a vacuum\" had just begun to be considered. Hooke developed an air pump for Boyle's experiments rather than use Ralph Greatorex's pump, which Hooke considered as \"too gross to perform any great matter\". Hooke's engine enabled the development of the eponymous law that was subsequently attributed to Boyle; Hooke had a particularly keen eye and was an adept mathematician, neither of which applied to Boyle. Hooke taught Boyle Euclid's \"Elements\" and Descartes's \"Principles of Philosophy\"; it also caused them to recognise fire as a chemical reaction and not, as Aristotle taught, a fundamental element of nature.\nRoyal Society.\nAccording to Henry Robinson, Librarian of The Royal Society in 1935:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Without his weekly experiments and prolific work the Society could scarcely have survived, or, at least, would have developed in a quite different way. It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that he was, historically, the creator of the Royal Society.\nThe Royal Society for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge by Experiment was founded in 1660 and given its Royal Charter in July 1662. On 5 November 1661, Robert Moray proposed the appointment of a curator to furnish the society with experiments and this was unanimously passed and Hooke was named on Boyle's recommendation. The Society did not have a reliable income to fully fund the post of Curator of Experiments but in 1664, John Cutler settled an annual gratuity of \u00a350 on the Society to found a \"Mechanick\" lectureship at Gresham College on the understanding the Society would appoint Hooke to this task. On 27 June 1664, Hooke was confirmed to the office and on 11 January 1665, he was named Curator by Office for life with an annual salary of \u00a380, consisting of \u00a330 from the Society and Cutler's \u00a350 annuity.\nIn June 1663, Hooke was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). On 20 March 1665, he was also appointed Gresham Professor of Geometry. On 13 September 1667, Hooke became acting Secretary of the Society and on 19 December 1677, he was appointed its Joint Secretary.\nPersonality, relationships, health, and death.\nAlthough John Aubrey described Hooke as a person of \"great virtue and goodness\". much has been written about the unpleasant side of Hooke's personality. According to his first biographer Richard Waller, Hooke was \"in person, but despicable\", and \"melancholy, mistrustful, and jealous\". Waller's comments influenced other writers for more than 200 years such that many books and articles\u00a0\u2013 especially biographies of Isaac Newton\u00a0\u2013 portray Hooke as a disgruntled, selfish, anti-social curmudgeon. For example, Arthur Berry said Hooke \"claimed credit for most of the scientific discoveries of the time\". Sullivan wrote he was \"positively unscrupulous\" and had an \"uneasy apprehensive vanity\" in dealings with Newton. Manuel described Hooke as \"cantankerous, envious, vengeful\". According to More, Hooke had both a \"cynical temperament\" and a \"caustic tongue\". Andrade was more sympathetic but still described Hooke as \"difficult\", \"suspicious\" and \"irritable\". In October 1675, the Council of the Royal Society considered a motion to expel Hooke because of an attack he made on Christiaan Huygens over scientific priority in watch design but it did not pass. According to Hooke's biographer Ellen Drake:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;if one studies the intellectual milieu of the time, the controversies and rivalries of the type in which he was involved seem almost to be the rule rather than the exception. And Hooke's reaction to such controversy involving his own discoveries and inventions seems mild in comparison to the behaviour of some of his contemporaries\".\nThe publication of Hooke's diary in 1935 revealed previously unknown details about his social and familial relationships. His biographer Margaret 'Espinasse said: \"the picture which is usually painted of Hooke as a morose ... recluse is completely false\". He interacted with noted artisans such as clock-maker Thomas Tompion and instrument-maker Christopher Cocks (Cox). Hooke often met Christopher Wren, with whom he shared many interests, and had a lasting friendship with John Aubrey. His diaries also make frequent reference to meetings at coffeehouses and taverns, as well as to dinners with Robert Boyle. On many occasions, Hooke took tea with his lab assistant Harry Hunt. Although he largely lived alone\u00a0\u2013 apart from the servants who ran his home\u00a0\u2013 his niece Grace Hooke and his cousin Tom Giles lived with him for some years as children.\nHooke never married. According to his diary, Hooke had a sexual relationship with his niece Grace, after she had turned 16. Grace was in his custody since the age of 10. He also had sexual relations with several maids and housekeepers. Hooke's biographer Stephen Inwood considers Grace to have been the love of his life, and he was devastated when she died in 1687. Inwood also mentions \"The age difference between him and Grace was commonplace and would not have upset his contemporaries as it does us\". The incestous relationship would nevertheless have been frowned upon and tried by an ecclesiastical court had it been discovered, it was not however a capital felony after 1660.\nSince childhood, Hooke suffered from migraine, tinnitus, dizziness, and bouts of insomnia; he also had a spinal deformity that was consistent with a diagnosis of Scheuermann's kyphosis, giving him in middle and later years a \"thin and crooked body, over-large head and protruding eyes\". Approaching these in a scientific spirit, he experimented with self-medication, diligently recording symptoms, substances, and effects in his diary. He regularly used sal ammoniac, emetics, laxatives, and opiates, which appear to have had an increasing effect on his physical and mental health over time.\nHooke died in London on 3 March 1703, having been blind and bedridden during the last year of his life. A chest containing \u00a38,000 in money and gold was found in his room at Gresham College. His library contained over 3,000 books in Latin, French, Italian, and English. Although he had talked of leaving a generous bequest to the Royal Society, which would have given his name to a library, laboratory, and lectures, no will was found and the money passed to a cousin named Elizabeth Stephens. Hooke was buried at St Helen's Church, Bishopsgate, in the City of London but the precise location of his grave is unknown.\nScience.\nHooke's role at the Royal Society was to demonstrate experiments from his own methods or at the suggestion of members. Among his earliest demonstrations were discussions of the nature of air and the implosion of glass bubbles that had been sealed with enclosed hot air. He also demonstrated that a dog could be kept alive with its thorax opened, provided air was pumped in and out of its lungs. He noted the difference between venous blood and arterial blood, and thus demonstrated that the (\"food of life\") and [flames] were the same thing. There were also experiments on gravity, the falling of objects, the weighing of bodies, the measurement of barometric pressure at different heights, and the movement of pendulums up to long. His biographer Margaret 'Espinasse described him as England's first meteorologist, in her description of his essay \"Method for making a history of the weather\". (Hooke specifies that a thermometer, a hygrometer, a wind gauge, and a record sheet be used for proper weather records.)\nAstronomy.\nIn May 1664, using a refracting telescope, Hooke observed the Great Red Spot of Jupiter for two hours as it moved across the planet's face. In March 1665, he published his findings and from them, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Cassini calculated the rotation period of Jupiter to be nine hours and fifty-five minutes.\nOne of the most-challenging problems Hooke investigated was the measurement of the distance from Earth to a star other than the Sun. Hooke selected the star Gamma Draconis and chose the method of parallax determination. In 1669, after several months of observing, Hooke believed the desired result had been achieved. It is now known his equipment was far too imprecise to obtain an accurate measurement.\nHooke's \"Micrographia\" contains illustrations of the Pleiades star cluster and lunar craters. He conducted experiments to investigate the formation of these craters and concluded their existence meant the Moon must have its own gravity, a radical departure from the contemporaneous Aristotelian celestial model. He also was an early observer of the rings of Saturn, and discovered one of the first-observed double stars, Gamma Arietis (a visual binary), in 1664.\nTo achieve these discoveries, Hooke needed better instruments than those that were available at the time. Accordingly, he invented three new mechanisms: the Hooke joint, a sophisticated universal joint that allowed his instruments to smoothly follow the apparent motion of the observed body; the first clockwork drive to automate the process; and a micrometer screw that allowed him to achieve a precision of ten seconds of arc. Hooke was dissatisfied with refracting telescopes so he built the first practical Gregorian telescope that used a silvered glass mirror.\nMechanics.\nIn 1660, Hooke discovered the law of elasticity that bears his name and describes the linear variation of tension with extension in an elastic spring. Hooke first described this discovery in an anagram \"ceiiinosssttuv\", whose solution he published in 1678 as (\"As the extension, so the force\"). His work on elasticity culminated in his development of the balance spring or hairspring, which for the first time enabled a portable timepiece\u00a0\u2013 a watch\u00a0\u2013 to keep time with reasonable accuracy. A bitter dispute between Hooke and Christiaan Huygens on the priority of this invention was to continue for centuries after the death of both but a note dated 23 June 1670 in the journals of the Royal Society, describing a demonstration of a balance-controlled watch before the Royal Society, may support Hooke's claim to priority for the idea. Nevertheless, it is Huygens who is credited with building the first watch to use a balance spring.\nHooke's announcement of his law of elasticity using an anagram was a method scientists, such as Hooke, Huygens, and Galileo, sometimes used to establish priority for a discovery without revealing details. Hooke used mechanical analogues to understand fundamental processes such as the motion of a spherical pendulum and of a ball in a hollow cone, to demonstrate central force due to gravity, and a hanging chain net with point loads to provide the optimum shape for a dome with heavy cross on top.\nDespite continuing reports to the contrary, Hooke did not influence Thomas Newcomen's invention of the steam engine; this myth, which originated in an article in the third edition of \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\", has been found to be mistaken.\nGravitation.\nWhile many of Hooke's contemporaries, such as Isaac Newton, believed in aether as a medium for transmitting attraction and repulsion between separated celestial bodies, Hooke argued for an attracting principle of gravitation in \"Micrographia\" (1665). In a communication to the Royal Society in 1666, he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I will explain a system of the world very different from any yet received. It is founded on the following positions. 1. That all the heavenly bodies have not only a gravitation of their parts to their own proper centre, but that they also mutually attract each other within their spheres of action. 2. That all bodies having a simple motion, will continue to move in a straight line, unless continually deflected from it by some extraneous force, causing them to describe a circle, an ellipse, or some other curve. 3. That this attraction is so much the greater as the bodies are nearer. As to the proportion in which those forces diminish by an increase of distance, I own I have not discovered it.\u00a0...\nHooke's 1674 Gresham lecture, \"An Attempt to Prove the Motion of the Earth by Observations\" (published 1679), said gravitation applies to \"all celestial bodies\" and restated these three propositions.\nHooke's statements up to 1674 make no mention, however, that an inverse square law applies or might apply to these attractions. His model of gravitation was also not yet universal, though it approached universality more closely than previous hypotheses. Hooke did not provide accompanying evidence or mathematical demonstration; he stated in 1674: \"Now what these several degrees [of gravitational attraction] are I have not yet experimentally verified\", indicating he did not yet know what law the gravitation might follow; and about his whole proposal, he said: \"This I only hint at present\u00a0... having my self many other things in hand which I would first compleat, and therefore cannot so well attend it\" (i.e. \"prosecuting this Inquiry\").\nIn November 1679, Hooke initiated a notable exchange of letters with Newton that was published in 1960. Hooke's ostensible purpose was to tell Newton he (Hooke) had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence; Hooke therefore wanted to hear from members about their research or their views about the research of others. Hooke asked Newton's opinions about various matters. Among other items, Hooke mentioned \"compounding the celestial motions of the planets of a direct motion by the tangent and an attractive motion towards the central body\"; his \"hypothesis of the lawes or causes of springinesse\"; a new hypothesis from Paris about planetary motions, which he described at length; efforts to carry out or improve national surveys; and the difference of latitude between London and Cambridge.\nNewton's reply offered \"a fansy of my own\" about a terrestrial experiment rather than a proposal about celestial motions that might detect the Earth's motion; the experiment would use a body suspended in air and then dropped. Hooke wanted to discern how Newton thought the falling body could experimentally reveal the Earth's motion by its direction of deviation from the vertical but Hooke went on hypothetically to consider how its motion could continue if the solid Earth had not been in the way, on a spiral path to the centre. Hooke disagreed with Newton's idea of the body's continuing motion. A further short correspondence developed; towards the end of it, writing on 6 January 1680 to Newton, Hooke communicated his \"supposition\u00a0... that the Attraction always is in a duplicate proportion to the Distance from the Center Reciprocall, and Consequently that the Velocity will be in a subduplicate proportion to the Attraction and Consequently as Kepler Supposes Reciprocall to the Distance\". (Hooke's inference about the velocity is incorrect.)\nIn 1686, when the first book of Newton's \"Principia\" was presented to the Royal Society, Hooke said he had given Newton the \"notion\" of \"the rule of the decrease of Gravity, being reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the Center\". At the same time, according to Edmond Halley's contemporaneous report, Hooke agreed \"the Demonstration of the Curves generated thereby\" was wholly Newton's.\nAccording to a 2002 assessment of the early history of the inverse square law: \"by the late 1660s, the assumption of an 'inverse proportion between gravity and the square of distance' was rather common and had been advanced by a number of different people for different reasons\". In the 1660s, Newton had shown for planetary motion under a circular assumption, force in the radial direction had an inverse-square relation with distance from the centre. Newton, who in May 1686 was presented with Hooke's claim to priority on the inverse square law, denied he was to be credited as author of the idea, giving reasons including the citation of prior work by others. Newton also said that, even if he had first heard of the inverse square proportion from Hooke (which Newton said he had not), he would still have some rights to it because of his mathematical developments and demonstrations. These, he said, enabled observations to be relied upon as evidence of its accuracy while according to Newton, Hooke, without mathematical demonstrations and evidence in favour of the supposition, could only guess it was approximately valid \"at great distances from the centre\".\nNewton accepted and acknowledged, in all editions of his \"Principia\", that Hooke and others had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system. Newton acknowledged Wren, Hooke, and Halley in this connection in his \"Scholium to Proposition 4\" in Book1. In a letter to Halley, Newton also acknowledged his correspondence with Hooke in 1679\u20131680 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomical matters but that did not mean, according to Newton, Hooke had told Newton anything new or original. Newton wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Yet am I not beholden to him for any light into that business\u00a0... but only for the diversion he gave me from my other studies to think on these things &amp; for his dogmaticalness in writing as if he had found the motion in the Ellipsis, which inclined me to try it.\nWhilst Newton was primarily a pioneer in mathematical analysis and its applications, and optical experimentation, Hooke was a creative experimenter of such great range who left some of his ideas, such as those about gravitation, undeveloped. In 1759, decades after the deaths of both Newton and Hooke, Alexis Clairaut, mathematical astronomer eminent in his own right in the field of gravitational studies, reviewed Hooke's published work on gravitation. According to Stephen Peter Rigaud, Clairaut wrote: \"The example of Hooke and that of Kepler [serves] to show what a distance there is between a truth that is glimpsed and a truth that is demonstrated\". I. Bernard Cohen said: \"Hooke's claim to the inverse-square law has masked Newton's far more fundamental debt to him, the analysis of curvilinear orbital motion. In asking for too much credit, Hooke effectively denied to himself the credit due him for a seminal idea\".\nHorology.\nHooke made important contributions to the science of timekeeping and was intimately involved in the advances of his time; these included refinement of the pendulum as a better regulator for clocks, increased precision of clock mechanisms and the use of the balance spring to improve the timekeeping of watches.\nGalileo had observed the regularity of a pendulum and Huygens first incorporated it in a clock; in 1668, Hooke demonstrated his new device to keep a pendulum swinging regularly in unsteady conditions. His invention of a tooth-cutting machine enabled a substantial improvement in the accuracy and precision of timepieces. Waller reported the invention was, by Hooke's death, in constant use among clock makers.\nHooke announced he conceived a way to build a marine chronometer to determine longitude. and with the help of Boyle and others, he attempted to patent it. In the process, Hooke demonstrated a pocket-watch of his own devising that was fitted with a coil spring attached to the arbour of the balance. Hooke's refusal to accept an escape clause in the proposed exclusive contract for the use of this idea resulted in its abandonment.\nHooke developed the principle of the balance spring independently of Huygens and at least five years beforehand. Huygens published his own work in \"Journal de Scavans\" in February 1675 and built the first functioning watch to use a balance spring.\nMicroscopy.\nIn 1663 and 1664, Hooke made his microscopic, and some astronomic, observations, which he collated in \"Micrographia\" in 1665. His book, which describes observations with microscopes and telescopes, as well as original work in biology, contains the earliest-recorded observation of a microorganism, the microfungus \"Mucor\". Hooke coined the term \"cell\", suggesting a resemblance between plant structures and honeycomb cells.The hand-crafted, leather-and-gold-tooled microscope he designed and used to make the observations for \"Micrographia\", which Christopher Cock made for him in London, is on display at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Maryland. Hooke's work developed from that of Henry Power, who published his microscopy work in \"Experimental Philosophy\" (1663); in turn, the Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek went on to develop increased magnification and so reveal protozoa, blood cells, and spermatozoa.\n\"Micrographia\" also contains Hooke's, or perhaps Boyle's and Hooke's, ideas on combustion. Hooke's experiments led him to conclude combustion involves a component of air, a statement with which modern scientists would agree but that was not understood widely, if at all, in the seventeenth century. He also concluded respiration and combustion involve a specific and limited component of air. According to Partington, if \"Hooke had continued his experiments on combustion, it is probable that he would have discovered oxygen\".\nSamuel Pepys wrote of the book in his diary on 21 January 16: \"Before I went to bed I sat up till two o\u2019clock in my chamber reading of Mr. Hooke's Microscopicall Observations, the most ingenious book that ever I read in my life\".\nPalaeontology and geology.\nOne of the observations in \"Micrographia\" is of fossil wood, the microscopic structure of which Hooke compared to that of ordinary wood. This led him to conclude that fossilised objects like petrified wood and fossil shells such as ammonites were the remains of living things that had been soaked in mineral-laden petrifying water. He believed that such fossils provided reliable clues about the history of life on Earth and, despite the objections of contemporary naturalists like John Ray\u00a0\u2013 who found the concept of extinction theologically unacceptable\u00a0\u2013 that in some cases they might represent species that had become extinct through some geological disaster. In a series of lectures in 1668, Hooke proposed the then-heretical idea the Earth's surface had been formed by volcanoes and earthquakes, and that the latter were responsible for shell fossils being found far above sea level.\nIn 1835, Charles Lyell, the Scottish geologist and associate of Charles Darwin, wrote of Hooke in \"Principles of Geology\": \"His treatise\u00a0... is the most philosophical production of that age, in regard to the causes of former changes in the organic and inorganic kingdoms of nature\".\nMemory.\nHooke's scientific model of human memory was one of the first of its kind. In a 1682 lecture to the Royal Society, Hooke proposed a mechanical analogue model of human memory that bore little resemblance to the mainly philosophical models of earlier writers. This model addressed the components of encoding, memory capacity, repetition, retrieval, and forgetting\u00a0\u2013 some with surprisingly modern accuracy. According to psychology professor Douglas Hintzman, Hooke's model's most-interesting points are that it allows for attention and other top-down influences on encoding; it uses resonance to implement parallel, cue-dependent retrieval; it explains memory for recency; it offers a single-system account of repetition and priming; and the power law of forgetting can be derived from the model's assumption in a straightforward way.\nOther.\nOn 8 July 1680, Hooke observed the nodal patterns associated with the modes of vibration of glass plates. He ran a bow along the edge of a flour-covered glass plate and saw the nodal patterns emerge. In acoustics, in 1681, Hooke showed the Royal Society that musical tones can be generated using spinning brass cogs cut with teeth in particular proportions.\nArchitecture.\nRobert Hooke was Surveyor to the City of London and chief assistant to Christopher Wren, in which capacities he helped Wren rebuild London after the Great Fire of 1666. Hooke designed the Monument to the Great Fire of London (1672), Montagu House in Bloomsbury (1674) and Bethlem Royal Hospital (1674), which became known as \"Bedlam\". Other buildings Hooke designed include the Royal College of Physicians (1679); Aske's Hospital (1679), Ragley Hall, Warwickshire (1680); the Church of St Mary Magdalene at Willen, Buckinghamshire (1680) and Ramsbury Manor, Wiltshire (1681). He worked on many of the London churches that were rebuilt after the fire; Hooke was generally subcontracted by Wren; from 1671 to 1696, Wren's office paid Hooke \u00a32,820 in fees, more than he ever earned from his Royal Society and Cutler Lectureship posts.\nWren and Hooke were both keen astronomers. The Monument to the Great Fire of London was designed to serve a scientific function as a zenith telescope for astronomical observation, though traffic vibration made it unusable for this purpose. The legacy of this can be observed in the construction of the spiral staircase, which has no central column, and in the observation chamber, which remains in place below ground level. He also collaborated with Wren on the design of St Paul's Cathedral; Hooke determined the ideal shape of an arch is an inverted catenary and thence that a circular series of such arches makes an ideal shape for the cathedral's dome.\nIn the reconstruction after the Great Fire, Hooke proposed redesigning London's streets on a grid pattern with wide boulevards and arteries, for which Wren and others also submitted proposals. The King decided both the prospective cost of building and compensation, and the need to quickly restore trade and population meant the city would be rebuilt on the original property lines. Hooke was given the task of surveying the ruins to identify foundations, street edges, and property boundaries. He was closely involved with the drafting of an Act of Common Council (April 1667), which set out the process by which the original foundations would be formally recognised and certificated. According to Lisa Jardine: \"in the four weeks from the 4th of October, [Hooke] helped map the fire-damaged area, began compiling a Land Information System for London, and drew up building regulations for an Act of Parliament to govern the rebuilding\". Stephen Inwood said: \"the surveyors' reports, which were generally written by Hooke, show an admirable ability to get to the nub of intricate neighbourly squabbles, and to produce a crisp and judicious recommendation from a tangle of claims and counter-claims\".\nHooke also had to measure and certify land that would be compulsorily purchased for the planned road widening so compensation could be paid. In 1670, he was appointed Surveyor of the Royal Works. Hooke's precise and detailed surveys enabled the production in 1677 of Ogilby and Morgan's large-scale map of London, the first-known to be of a specific scale (1:1200).\nLikenesses.\nNo authenticated portrait of Robert Hooke exists, a situation that has sometimes been attributed to the heated conflicts between Hooke and Isaac Newton, although Hooke's biographer Allan Chapman rejects as a myth claims Newton or his acolytes deliberately destroyed Hooke's portrait. German antiquarian and scholar Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach visited the Royal Society in 1710 and his account of his visit mentions him being shown portraits of \"Boyle and Hoock\", which were said to be good likenesses but, while Boyle's portrait survives, Hooke's has been lost. In Hooke's time, the Royal Society met at Gresham College but within a few months of Hooke's death Newton became the Society's president and plans for a new meeting place were made. When the Royal Society moved to new premises in 1710, Hooke's was the only portrait that went missing and remains so. According to Hooke's diary, he sat for a portrait by renowned artist Mary Beale, so it is possible such a portrait did at some time exist. Conversely, Chapman draws attention to the fact that Waller's extensively illustrated work, \"Posthumous works of Robert Hooke\", published shortly after Hooke's death, has no portrait of him.\nTwo contemporaneous, written descriptions of Hooke's appearance have survived; his close friend John Aubrey described him in middle age and at the height of his creative powers:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He is but of midling stature, something crooked, pale faced, and his face but little below, but his head is lardge, his eie full and popping, and not quick; a grey eie. He haz a delicate head of haire, browne, and of an excellent moist curle. He is and ever was temperate and moderate in dyet, etc.\u2014\u200a\nRichard Waller, writing in 1705 in \"The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke\", described the elderly Hooke:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As to his Person he was but despicable, being very crooked, tho' I have heard from himself, and others, that he was strait till about 16 Years of Age when he first grew awry, by frequent practising, with a Turn-Lath\u00a0... He was always very pale and lean, and laterly nothing but Skin and Bone, with a Meagre Aspect, his Eyes grey and full, with a sharp ingenious Look whilst younger; his nose but thin, of a moderate height and length; his Mouth meanly wide, and upper lip thin; his Chin sharp, and Forehead large; his Head of a middle size. He wore his own Hair of a dark Brown colour, very long and hanging neglected over his Face uncut and lank\u00a0...\nOn 3 July 1939, \"Time\" magazine published a portrait, supposedly of Hooke, but when Ashley Montagu traced the source, it was found to lack a verifiable connection to Hooke. Montagu found the two contemporaneous written descriptions of Hooke's appearance agree with one another but that neither matches the portrait in \"Time\".\nIn 2003, historian Lisa Jardine conjectured that a recently discovered portrait was of Hooke, but this proposal was disproved by William B. Jensen of the University of Cincinnati who identified the subject as the Flemish scholar Jan Baptist van Helmont.\nOther possible likenesses of Hooke include:\nIn 2003, the amateur painter Rita Greer embarked on a project to memorialise Hooke and produce credible images of him, both painted and drawn, which she believes match Aubrey's and Waller's descriptions of him. Greer's images of Hooke, which are free to use under the Free Art License, have been used for television programmes in the UK and the US, in books and magazines, and for public relations.\nIn 2019, Larry Griffing, an associate professor in Biology at Texas A&amp;M University, proposed that a portrait by Mary Beale of an unknown sitter and referred to as \"Portrait of a Mathematician\"\u00a0\u2013 is actually of Hooke, noting the physical features of the sitter in the portrait match Hooke's. The figure points to a drawing of elliptical motion that appears to match an unpublished manuscript created by him. The painting also includes an orrery depicting the same principle. According to Griffing, buildings included in the image are of Lowther Castle, now in Cumbria, and its Church of St Michael. The church was renovated under one of Hooke's architectural commissions, which Beale would have known from her extensive body of work for the Lowther family. According to Griffing, the painting would once have been owned by the Royal Society but was abandoned when Newton, its president, moved the Society's headquarters in 1710. Christopher Whittaker of the School of Education, University of Durham, England, has questioned Griffing's analysis; according to Whittaker, it is more likely to be of Isaac Barrow. In a response to Whittaker, Griffing reaffirmed his deduction.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In practice, other key pieces of program state are usually dumped at the same time, including the processor registers, which may include the program counter and stack pointer, memory management information, and other processor and operating system flags and information. A snapshot dump (or snap dump) is a memory dump requested by the computer operator or by the running program, after which the program is able to continue. Core dumps are often used to assist in diagnosing and debugging errors in computer programs.\nOn many operating systems, a fatal exception in a program automatically triggers a core dump. By extension, the phrase \"to dump core\" has come to mean in many cases, any fatal error, regardless of whether a record of the program memory exists. The term \"core dump\", \"memory dump\", or just \"dump\" has also become jargon to indicate any output of a large amount of raw data for further examination or other purposes.\nBackground.\nThe name comes from magnetic-core memory, the principal form of random-access memory from the 1950s to the 1970s. The name has remained long after magnetic-core technology became obsolete.\nEarliest core dumps were paper printouts of the contents of memory, typically arranged in columns of octal or hexadecimal numbers (a \"hex dump\"), sometimes accompanied by their interpretations as machine language instructions, text strings, or decimal or floating-point numbers (\"cf.\" disassembler).\nAs memory sizes increased and post-mortem analysis utilities were developed, dumps were written to magnetic media like tape or disk.\nInstead of only displaying the contents of the applicable memory, modern operating systems typically generate a file containing an image of the memory belonging to the crashed process, or the memory images of parts of the address space related to that process, along with other information such as the values of processor registers, program counter, system flags, and other information useful in determining the root cause of the crash. These files can be viewed as text, printed, or analysed with specialised tools such as elfdump on Unix and Unix-like systems, objdump and kdump on Linux, IPCS (Interactive Problem Control System) on IBM z/OS, DVF (Dump Viewing Facility) on IBM z/VM, WinDbg on Microsoft Windows, Valgrind, or other debuggers.\nIn some operating systems an application or operator may request a snapshot of selected storage blocks, rather than all of the storage used by the application or operating system.\nUses.\nCore dumps can serve as useful debugging aids in several situations. On early standalone or batch-processing systems, core dumps allowed a user to debug a program without monopolizing the (very expensive) computing facility for debugging; a printout could also be more convenient than debugging using front panel switches and lights.\nOn shared computers, whether time-sharing, batch processing, or server systems, core dumps allow off-line debugging of the operating system, so that the system can go back into operation immediately.\nCore dumps allow a user to save a crash for later or off-site analysis, or comparison with other crashes. For embedded computers, it may be impractical to support debugging on the computer itself, so analysis of a dump may take place on a different computer. Some operating systems such as early versions of Unix did not support attaching debuggers to running processes, so core dumps were necessary to run a debugger on a process's memory contents.\nCore dumps can be used to capture data freed during dynamic memory allocation and may thus be used to retrieve information from a program that is no longer running. In the absence of an interactive debugger, the core dump may be used by an assiduous programmer to determine the error from direct examination.\nSnap dumps are sometimes a convenient way for applications to record quick and dirty debugging output.\nAnalysis.\nA core dump generally represents the complete contents of the dumped regions of the address space of the dumped process. Depending on the operating system, the dump may contain few or no data structures to aid interpretation of the memory regions. In these systems, successful interpretation requires that the program or user trying to interpret the dump understands the structure of the program's memory use.\nA debugger can use a symbol table, if one exists, to help the programmer interpret dumps, identifying variables symbolically and displaying source code; if the symbol table is not available, less interpretation of the dump is possible, but there might still be enough possible to determine the cause of the problem. There are also special-purpose tools called dump analyzers to analyze dumps. One popular tool, available on many operating systems, is the GNU binutils' objdump.\nOn modern Unix-like operating systems, administrators and programmers can read core dump files using the GNU Binutils Binary File Descriptor library (BFD), and the GNU Debugger (gdb) and objdump that use this library. This library will supply the raw data for a given address in a memory region from a core dump; it does not know anything about variables or data structures in that memory region, so the application using the library to read the core dump will have to determine the addresses of variables and determine the layout of data structures itself, for example by using the symbol table for the program undergoing debugging.\nAnalysts of crash dumps from Linux systems can use kdump or the Linux Kernel Crash Dump (LKCD).\nCore dumps can save the context (state) of a process at a given state for returning to it later. Systems can be made highly available by transferring core between processors, sometimes via core dump files themselves.\nCore can also be dumped onto a remote host over a network (which is a security risk).\nOS/360 introduced the service aid IMDPRDMP to print stand-alone and SVC dumps. This program formats several system control blocks in addition to printing storage areas in hexadecimal and EBCDIC. The OS/VS1 and OS/VS2 versions are called HMDPRDMP and AMDPRDMP.\nInteractive Problem Control System (IPCS) is a full screen dump reader that IBM introduced for OS/VS2 (MVS), DOS/VSE and VM/370. The MVS version performs functions similar to AMDPRDMP, and uses compatible control block descriptions for formatting. IBM eventually dropped AMDPRDMP in favor of IPCS.\nUsers of IBM mainframes running z/OS can browse both SVC and transaction dumps using IPCS, which supports user written scripts in REXX and supports point-and-shoot browsing of dumps.\nCore-dump files.\nFormat.\nIn older and simpler operating systems, each process had a contiguous address-space, so a dump file was sometimes simply a file with the sequence of bytes, digits, characters or words. On other systems a dump file contained discrete records, each containing a storage address and the associated contents. On the earliest of these machines, the dump was often written by a stand-alone dump program rather than by the application or the operating system.\nThe IBSYS monitor for the IBM 7090 included a System Core-Storage Dump Program that supported post-mortem and snap dumps.\nOn the IBM System/360, the standard operating systems wrote formatted ABEND and SNAP dumps, with the addresses, registers, storage contents, etc., all converted into printable forms. Later releases added the ability to write unformatted dumps, called at that time core image dumps (also known as SVC dumps.)\nIn modern operating systems, a process address space may contain gaps, and it may share pages with other processes or files, so more elaborate representations are used; they may also include other information about the state of the program at the time of the dump.\nIn Unix-like systems, core dumps generally use the standard executable image-format:\nNaming.\nOS/360 and successors.\nIn OS/360 and successors, a job may assign arbitrary data set names (dsnames) to the ddnames codice_1 and codice_2 for a formatted ABEND dump and to arbitrary ddnames for SNAP dumps, or define those ddnames as SYSOUT. The Damage Assessment and Repair (DAR) facility added an automatic unformatted storage dump to the dataset codice_3 at the time of failure as well as a console dump requested by the operator. A job may assign an arbitrary dsname to the ddname codice_4 for an unformatted ABEND dump, or define that ddname as SYSOUT. The newer transaction dump is very similar to the older SVC dump. The \"Interactive Problem Control System\" (IPCS), added to OS/VS2 by \"Selectable Unit\" (SU) 57 and part of every subsequent MVS release, can be used to interactively analyze storage dumps on DASD. IPCS understands the format and relationships of system control blocks, and can produce a formatted display for analysis. The current versions of IPCS allow inspection of active address spaces without first taking a storage dump and of unformaated dumps on SPOOL.\nUnix-like.\nSince Solaris\u00a08, system utility codice_5 allows the name and location of core files to be configured. Dumps of user processes are traditionally created as codice_6. On Linux (since versions 2.4.21 and 2.6 of the Linux kernel mainline), a different name can be specified via procfs using the codice_7 configuration file; the specified name can also be a template that contains tags substituted by, for example, the executable filename, the process ID, or the reason for the dump. System-wide dumps on modern Unix-like systems often appear as codice_8 or codice_9.\nOthers.\nSystems such as Microsoft Windows, which use filename extensions, may use extension codice_10; for example, core dumps may be named codice_11 or codice_12.\nWindows memory dumps.\nMicrosoft Windows supports two memory dump formats, described below.\nKernel-mode dumps.\nThere are five types of kernel-mode dumps:\nTo analyze the Windows kernel-mode dumps Debugging Tools for Windows are used, a set that includes tools like WinDbg &amp; DumpChk.\nUser-mode memory dumps.\nUser-mode memory dump, also known as \"minidump\", is a memory dump of a single process. It contains selected data records: full or partial (filtered) process memory; list of the threads with their call stacks and state (such as registers or TEB); information about handles to the kernel objects; list of loaded and unloaded libraries. Full list of options available in codice_13 enum.\nSpace missions.\nThe NASA Voyager program was probably the first craft to routinely utilize the core dump feature in the Deep Space segment. The core dump feature is a mandatory telemetry feature for the Deep Space segment as it has been proven to minimize system diagnostic costs. The Voyager craft uses routine core dumps to spot memory damage from cosmic ray events.\nSpace Mission core dump systems are mostly based on existing toolkits for the target CPU or subsystem. However, over the duration of a mission the core dump subsystem may be substantially modified or enhanced for the specific needs of the mission.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nDescriptions of the file format\nKernel core dumps:"}
{"id": "49723", "revid": "3736169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49723", "title": "Reserved word", "text": "Word in a programming language that cannot be used as an identifier\nIn a programming language, a reserved word (sometimes known as a reserved identifier) is a word that cannot be used by a programmer as an identifier, such as the name of a variable, function, or label \u2013 it is \"reserved from use\". In brief, an \"identifier\" starts with a letter, which is followed by any sequence of letters and digits (in some languages, the underscore '_' is treated as a letter).\nIn an imperative programming language and in many object-oriented programming languages, apart from assignments and subroutine calls, keywords are often used to identify a particular statement, e.g. if, while, do, for, etc. Many languages treat keywords as reserved words, including Ada, C, C++, COBOL, Java, and Pascal. The number of reserved words varies widely from one language to another: C has about 30 while COBOL has about 400.\nA few languages do not have any reserved words; Fortran and PL/I identify keywords by context, while Algol 60 and Algol 68 generally use stropping to distinguish keywords from programmer-defined identifiers, e.g. codice_1 or codice_2 or codice_3 or codice_4is a keyword distinct from identifier codice_4.\nMost programming languages have a standard library (or libraries), e.g. mathematical functions sin, cos, etc. The names provided by a library are not reserved, and can be redefined by a programmer if the library functionality is not required.\nDistinction.\nWhen using an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) to develop a program, the IDE will generally highlight reserved words by displaying them in a different colour. In some IDEs, comments may also be highlighted (in yet another colour). This makes it easy for a programmer to notice unexpected use of a reserved word and/or failure to terminate a comment correctly.\nThere may be reserved words which are not keywords. For example, in Java, codice_6 and codice_7 are reserved words used as Boolean (logical) literals. As another example, in Pascal, codice_8 and codice_9 are reserved words used as operators (integer division and remainder).\nThere may also be reserved words which have no defined meaning. For example, in Java, codice_10 and codice_11 are listed as reserved words, but are not otherwise mentioned in the Java syntax rules.\nA keyword such as if or while is used during syntax analysis to determine what sort of statement is being considered. Such analysis is much simpler if keywords are either reserved or stropped. Consider the complexity of using contextual analysis in Fortran 77 to distinguish:\n IF (B) l1,l2 ! two-way branch, where B is a boolean/logical expression \n IF (N) l1,l2,l3 ! three-way branch, where N is a numeric expression\n IF (B) THEN ! start conditional block\n IF (B) THEN = 3.1 ! conditional assignment to variable THEN\n IF (B) X = 10 ! single conditional statement\n IF (B) GOTO l4 ! conditional jump\n IF (N) = 2 ! assignment to a subscripted variable named IF\nPL/I can also allow some apparently confusing constructions:\n IF IF = THEN THEN ... /* (the second codice_12 and the first codice_13 are variables */\nAdvantages.\nPrograms may be more readable as compared with a programming language which uses stropping.\nIt is easier for an IDE to highlight keywords, without having to do a contextual analysis to determine which words are actually keywords (see Fortran examples in previous section).\nA compiler can be faster, since it can quickly determine if a word is a keyword, without having to do a contextual analysis over the whole of an arbitrarily long statement.\nDisadvantages.\nA programming language may be difficult for new users to learn because of a (possibly long) list of reserved words to memorize which can't be used as identifiers. \nIt may be difficult to extend the language because addition of reserved words for new features might invalidate existing programs or, conversely, \"overloading\" of existing reserved words with new meanings can be confusing. \nPorting programs can be problematic because a word not reserved by one system or compiler might be reserved by another.\nFurther reservation.\nBeyond reserving specific lists of words, some languages reserve entire ranges of words, for use as private spaces for future language version, different dialects, compiler vendor-specific extensions, or for internal use by a compiler, notably in name mangling.\nThis is most often done by using a prefix, often one or more underscores. C and C++ are notable in this respect: C99 reserves identifiers that start with two underscores or an underscore followed by an uppercase letter, and further reserves identifiers that start with a single underscore (in the ordinary and tag spaces) for use in file scope; with C++03 further reserves identifiers that contain a double underscore anywhere \u2013 this allows the use of a double underscore as a separator (to connect user identifiers), for instance.\nThe frequent use of a double underscores in internal identifiers in Python gave rise to the abbreviation \"dunder;\" this was coined by Mark Jackson and independently by Tim Hochberg, within minutes of each other, both in reply to the same question in 2002.\nSpecification.\nThe list of reserved words and keywords in a language are defined when a language is developed, and both form part of a language's formal specification. Generally one wishes to minimize the number of reserved words, to avoid restricting valid identifier names. Further, introducing new reserved words breaks existing programs that use that word (it is not backwards compatible), so this is avoided. To prevent this and provide forward compatibility, sometimes words are reserved without having a current use (a reserved word that is not a keyword), as this allows the word to be used in future without breaking existing programs. Alternatively, new language features can be implemented as predefineds, which can be overridden, thus not breaking existing programs.\nReasons for flexibility include allowing compiler vendors to extend the specification by including non-standard features, different standard dialects of language to extend it, or future versions of the language to include additional features. For example, a procedural language may anticipate adding object-oriented capabilities in a future version or some dialect, at which point one might add keywords like codice_14 or codice_15. To accommodate this possibility, the current specification may make these reserved words, even if they are not currently used.\nA notable example is in Java, where codice_11 and codice_10 are reserved words \u2014 they have no meaning in Java but they also cannot be used as identifiers. By reserving the terms, they can be implemented in future versions of Java, if desired, without breaking older Java source code. For example, there was a proposal in 1999 to add C++-like codice_11 to the language, which was possible using the codice_11 word, since it was reserved but currently unused; however, this proposal was rejected \u2013 notably because even though adding the feature would not break any existing programs, using it in the standard library (notably in collections) \"would\" break compatibility. JavaScript also contains a number of reserved words without special functionality; the exact list varies by version and mode.\nLanguages differ significantly in how frequently they introduce new reserved words or keywords and how they name them, with some languages being very conservative and introducing new keywords rarely or never, to avoid breaking existing programs, while other languages introduce new keywords more freely, requiring existing programs to change existing identifiers that conflict. A case study is given by new keywords in C11 compared with C++11, both from 2011 \u2013 recall that in C and C++, identifiers that begin with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter are reserved:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The C committee prefers not to create new keywords in the user name space, as it is generally expected that each revision of C will avoid breaking older C programs. By comparison, the C++ committee (WG21) prefers to make new keywords as normal\u2010looking as the old keywords. For example, C++11 defines a new codice_20 keyword to designate static storage local to one thread. C11 defines the new keyword as codice_21 In the new C11 header &lt;threads.h&gt;, there is a macro definition to provide the normal\u2010looking name:\ncodice_22\nThat is, C11 introduced the keyword codice_23 within an existing set of reserved words (those with a certain prefix), and then used a separate facility (macro processing) to allow its use as if it were a new keyword without any prefixing, while C++11 introduce the keyword codice_20 despite this not being an existing reserved word, breaking any programs that used this, but without requiring macro processing.\nReserved words and language independence.\nMicrosoft's .NET Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) specification allows code written in 40+ different programming languages to be combined into a final product. Because of this, identifier/reserved word collisions can occur when code implemented in one language tries to execute code written in another language. For example, a Visual Basic (.NET) library may contain a class definition such as:\n' Class Definition of This in Visual Basic.NET:\nPublic Class this\n ' This class does something...\nEnd Class\nIf this is compiled and distributed as part of a toolbox, a C# programmer, wishing to define a variable of type \"codice_25\" would encounter a problem: codice_26 is a reserved word in C#. Thus, the following will not compile in C#:\n// Using This Class in C#:\nthis x = new this(); // Won't compile!\nA similar issue arises when accessing members, overriding virtual methods, and identifying namespaces.\nThis is resolved by stropping. To work around this issue, the specification allows placing (in C#) the at-sign before the identifier, which forces it to be considered an identifier rather than a reserved word by the compiler:\n// Using This Class in C#:\n@this x = new @this(); // Will compile! \nFor consistency, this use is also permitted in non-public settings such as local variables, parameter names, and private members.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one of two extant species of bison, along with the European bison. Its historical range \"circa\" 9000 BC is referred to as the great bison belt, a tract of rich grassland spanning from Alaska south to the Gulf of Mexico, and east to the Atlantic Seaboard (nearly to the Atlantic tidewater in some areas), as far north as New York, south to Georgia, and according to some sources, further south to northern Florida, with sightings in North Carolina near Buffalo Ford on the Catawba River as late as 1750.\nTwo subspecies or ecotypes have been described: the plains bison (\"B. b. bison\"), smaller and with a more rounded hump; and the wood bison (\"B. b. athabascae\"), the larger of the two and having a taller, square hump. Furthermore, the plains bison has been suggested to consist of a northern plains (\"B. b. montanae\") and a southern plains (\"B. b. bison\") subspecies, bringing the total to three. However, this is generally not supported. The wood bison is one of the largest wild species of extant bovid in the world, surpassed only by the Asian gaur. Among extant land animals in North America, the bison is the heaviest and the longest, and the second tallest after the moose.\nOnce roaming in vast herds, the species nearly became extinct by a combination of commercial hunting and slaughter in the 19th century and introduction of bovine diseases from domestic cattle. With an estimated population of 60 million in the late 18th century, the species was culled down to just 541 animals by 1889 as part of the subjugation of the Native Americans, because the American bison was a major resource for their traditional way of life (food source, hides for clothing and shelter, and horns and bones for tools). Recovery efforts expanded in the mid-20th century, with a resurgence to roughly 31,000 wild bison as of March 2019. For many years, the population was primarily found in a few national parks and reserves. Through multiple reintroductions, the species now freely roams wild in several regions in the United States, Canada and Mexico, others are kept in smaller natural areas as conservation herds, while some are also kept in private commercial herds. The American bison has also been introduced to Yakutia in Russia.\nSpanning back millennia, Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains have had cultural and spiritual connections to the American bison. It is the national mammal of the United States.\nEtymology.\nIn American English, both \"buffalo\" and \"bison\" are considered correct terms for the American bison. However, in British English, the word \"buffalo\" is reserved for the African buffalo and water buffalo and not used for the bison.\nIn English usage, the term \"buffalo\" was used to refer to the American mammal as early as 1625. The word \"bison\" was applied in the 1690s.\n\"Buffalo\" was applied to the American bison by Samuel de Champlain as the French word \"buffles\" in 1616 (published 1619), after seeing skins and a drawing. These were shown to him by members of the Nipissing First Nation, who said they traveled forty days (from east of Lake Huron) to trade with another nation who hunted the animals. \"Buffel\" in turn comes from Portuguese \"bufalo\" (water buffalo), which comes from Latin \"bufalus\" (an antelope, gazelle, or wild ox), from Greek \"boubalos\". The same Greek word \"boubalos\" is also the origin for the Bubal hartebeest.\n\"Bison\" was borrowed from French \"bison\" in the early 17th century, from Latin \"bison\" (aurochs), from a Proto-Germanic word similar to wisent and, per Etymonline, first applied to American buffalo in the 1690s.\nIn Plains Indian languages in general, male and female bison are distinguished, with each having a different designation rather than there being a single generic word covering both sexes. Thus:\nSuch a distinction is not a general feature of the language (for example, Arapaho possesses gender-neutral terms for other large mammals such as elk, mule deer, etc.), and so presumably is due to the special significance of the bison in Plains Indian life and culture.\nDescription.\nA bison has a shaggy, long, dark-brown winter coat, and a lighter-weight, lighter-brown summer coat. Male bison are significantly larger and heavier than females. Plains bison are often in the smaller range of sizes, and wood bison in the larger range. Head-rump lengths at maximum up to for males and for females long and the tail adding . Heights at withers in the species can reach up to for \"B. b. bison\" and \"B. b. athabascae\" respectively. Typically weights can range from , with medians of (\"B.b. bison\") and (\"B.b.athabascae\") in males, and with medians of in females, although the lowest weights probably representing typical weight around the age of sexual maturity at 2 to 3 years of age.\nThe heaviest wild bull for \"B.b.bison\" ever recorded weighed while there had been bulls estimated to be . \"B.b.athabascae\" is significantly larger and heavier on average than \"B.b.bison\" while the number of recorded samples for the former was limited after the rediscovery of a relatively pure herd. Elk Island National Park, which has wild populations of both wood and plains bison, has recorded maximum weights for bull bison of (plains) and (wood), but noted that 3/4 of all bison over were wood bison. When raised in captivity and farmed for meat, the bison can grow unnaturally heavy and the largest semidomestic bison weighed . The heads and forequarters are massive, and both sexes have short, curved horns that can grow up to long with to width, which they use in fighting for status within the herd and for defense.\nBison are herbivores, grazing on the grasses and sedges of the North American prairies. Their daily schedule involves two-hour periods of grazing, resting, and cud chewing, then moving to a new location to graze again. Sexually mature young bulls may try to start mating with cows by the age of two or three years, but if more mature bulls are present, they may not be able to compete until they reach five years of age.\nFor the first two months of life, calves are lighter in color than mature bison. Though extremely rare, white buffalos exist.\nEvolution.\nBison are members of the tribe Bovini. Genetic evidence from nuclear DNA indicates that the closest living relatives of bison are yaks, with bison being nested within the genus \"Bos,\" rendering \"Bos\" without including bison paraphyletic. While nuclear DNA indicates that the two living bison species are each other's closest living relatives, the mitochondrial DNA of European bison is more closely related to that of domestic cattle and aurochs, which is suggested to be the result of either incomplete lineage sorting or ancient introgression. \nBison first appeared in Asia during the Early Pleistocene, around 2.6 million years ago. Bison only arrived in North America 195,000 to 135,000 years ago, during the late Middle Pleistocene, descending from the widespread Siberian steppe bison (\"Bison priscus\"), which had migrated through Beringia. Following their first appearance in North America, the bison rapidly differentiated into new species, such as the largest of all bison, the long-horned \"Bison latifrons\", along with \"Bison antiquus\". The first appearance of bison in North America is considered to define the regional Rancholabrean faunal stage, due to its major impact on the ecology of the continent. Modern American bison are thought to have evolved from \"B. antiquus\" at the end of the Late Pleistocene - beginning of the Holocene, with likely intermediates between the species referred to as \"Bison \"occidentalis\"\". The North American bison population experienced demographic stability during the Middle Holocene but began a slow decline in the Late Holocene beginning about 2,700 BP.\nDifferences from European bison.\nAlthough they are superficially similar, the American and European bison exhibit a number of physical and behavioral differences. Adult American bison are slightly heavier on average because of their less rangy build and have shorter legs, which render them slightly shorter at the shoulder. American bison tend to graze more and browse less than their European relatives because their necks are set differently. Compared to the nose of the American bison, that of the European species is set farther forward than the forehead when the neck is in a neutral position. The body of the American bison is hairier, though its tail has less hair than that of the European bison. The horns of the European bison point forward through the plane of its face, making it more adept at fighting through the interlocking of horns in the same manner as domestic cattle, unlike the American bison, which favors charging. American bison are more easily tamed than the European and breed more readily with domestic cattle.\nCrossbreeding with cattle.\nDuring the population bottleneck, after the great slaughter of American bison during the 19th century, the number of bison remaining alive in North America declined to as low as 541. During that period, a handful of ranchers gathered remnants of the existing herds to save the species from extinction. These ranchers bred some of the bison with cattle in an effort to produce \"cattalo\" or \"beefalo\". Accidental crossings were also known to occur. Generally, male domestic bulls were crossed with bison cows, producing offspring of which only the females were fertile. The crossbred animals did not demonstrate any form of hybrid vigor, so the practice was abandoned. The proportion of cattle DNA that has been measured in introgressed individuals and bison herds today is typically quite low, ranging from 0.56 to 1.8%. Many claimed \"beefalo\", even those regarded as pedigree, have no detectable bison ancestry. In the United States, many ranchers are now using DNA testing to cull the residual cattle genetics from their bison herds. The U.S. National Bison Association has adopted a code of ethics which prohibits its members from deliberately crossbreeding bison with any other species.\nRange and population.\nPopulation estimates in 2010 ranged from 400,000 to 500,000, with approximately 20,500 animals in 62 conservation herds and the remainder in approximately 6,400 commercial herds. According to the IUCN, roughly 15,000 bison are considered wild, free-range bison not primarily confined by fencing.\nThe Nature Conservancy (TNC) has reintroduced bison to over a dozen nature preserves around the United States. In October 2016, TNC established its easternmost bison herd in the country, at Kankakee Sands nature preserve in Morocco, Newton County, Indiana. In 2014, U.S. Tribes and Canadian First Nations signed a treaty to help with the restoration of bison, the first to be signed in nearly 150 years.\nHabitat and trails.\nAmerican bison live in river valleys, and on prairies and plains. Typical habitat is open or semiopen grasslands, as well as sagebrush, semiarid lands, and scrublands. Some lightly wooded areas are also known historically to have supported bison. Bison also graze in hilly or mountainous areas where the slopes are not steep. Though not particularly known as high-altitude animals, bison in the Yellowstone Park bison herd are frequently found at elevations above , and the Henry Mountains bison herd is found on the plains around the Henry Mountains, Utah, as well as in mountain valleys of the Henry Mountains to an altitude of . Reintroduced plains bison in Banff National Park have been observed to roam mountainous areas, including high ridges and steep drainages. Archaeological finds indicate some bison to spent their lives within mountain ranges while others may have migrated in and out.\nThose in Yukon, Canada, typically summer in alpine plateaus above treeline. The first thoroughfares of North America, except for the time-obliterated paths of mastodon or muskox and the routes of the mound builders, were the traces made by bison and deer in seasonal migration and between feeding grounds and salt licks. Many of these routes, hammered by countless hoofs instinctively following watersheds and the crests of ridges in avoidance of lower places' summer muck and winter snowdrifts, and often following the routes of least resistance across rolling terrain, were followed by the aboriginal North Americans as routes to hunting grounds and as warriors' paths. They were invaluable to explorers and were adopted by pioneers.\nBison traces were characteristically north and south along seasonal migration routes, but several key east\u2013west buffalo trails were used later as routes for railways. Some of these include the Cumberland Gap through the Blue Ridge Mountains to upper Kentucky. A heavily used trace crossed the Ohio River at the Falls of the Ohio and ran west, crossing the Wabash River near Vincennes, Indiana. In Senator Thomas Hart Benton's phrase saluting these sagacious path-makers, the bison paved the way for the railroads to the Pacific.\nMexico.\nThe southern extent of the historic range of the American bison includes northern Mexico and adjoining areas in the United States as documented by archeological records and historical accounts from Mexican archives from 700\u00a0CE to the 19th century. The Janos-Hidalgo bison herd has ranged between Chihuahua, Mexico, and New Mexico, United States, since at least the 1920s. The persistence of this herd suggests that habitat for bison is suitable in northern Mexico. In 2009, genetically pure bison were reintroduced to the Janos Biosphere Reserve in northern Chihuahua adding to the Mexican bison population. In 2020, the second herd was formed in Maderas del Carmen. A private reserve named Jag\u00fcey de Ferniza has kept bison since before the above-mentioned reintroductions in Coahuila.\nIntroductions to Siberia.\nSince 2006, an outherd of wood bison sent from Alberta's Elk Island National Park was established in Yakutia, Russia as a practice of pleistocene rewilding; wood bison are the most similar to the extinct steppe bison species (\"Bison priscus sp.\"). The bison are adapting well to the cold climate, and Yakutia's Red List officially registered the species in 2019; a second herd was formed in 2020.\nPlains bison were also translocated into the Pleistocene Park, as more-favored wood bison could not be acquired.\nBehavior and ecology.\nBison are migratory and herd migrations can be directional as well as altitudinal in some areas. Bison have usual daily movements between foraging sites during the summer. In the Hayden Valley, Wyoming, bison have been recorded traveling, on average, per day. The summer ranges of bison appear to be influenced by seasonal vegetation changes, interspersion and size of foraging sites, the rut, and the number of biting insects. The size of preserve and availability of water may also be a factor. Bison are largely grazers, eating primarily grasses and sedges, but when food is scarce, they will eat vegetation such as sagebrush. On shortgrass pasture, bison predominately consume warm-season grasses. On mixed prairie, cool-season grasses, including some sedges, apparently compose 79\u201396% of their diet. In montane and northern areas, sedges are selected throughout the year. Bison also drink water or consume snow on a daily basis.\nSocial behavior and reproduction.\nFemale bison live in maternal herds which include other females and their offspring. Male offspring leave their maternal herd when around three years old and either live alone or join other males in bachelor herds. Male and female herds usually do not mingle until the breeding season, which can occur from July through September. However, female herds may also contain a few older males. During the breeding season, dominant bulls maintain a small harem of females for mating. Individual bulls \"tend\" cows until allowed to mate, by following them around and chasing away rival males. The tending bull shields the female's vision with his body so she will not see any other challenging males. A challenging bull may bellow or roar to get a female's attention, and the tending bull has to bellow or roar back. The most dominant bulls mate in the first 2\u20133 weeks of the season. More subordinate bulls mate with any remaining estrous cow that has not mated yet. Male bison play no part in raising the young.\nBison herds have dominance hierarchies that exist for both males and females. A bison's dominance is related to its birth date. Bison born earlier in the breeding season are more likely to be larger and more dominant as adults. Thus, bison are able to pass on their dominance to their offspring as dominant bison breed earlier in the season. In addition to dominance, the older bison of a generation also have a higher fertility rate than the younger ones.\nBison mate in August and September; gestation is 285 days. A single reddish-brown calf nurses until the next calf is born. If the cow is not pregnant, a calf will nurse for 18 months. Cows nurse their calves for at least 7 or 8 months, but most calves seem to be weaned before the end of their first year. At three years of age, bison cows are mature enough to produce a calf. The birthing period for bison in boreal biomes is protracted compared to that of other northern ungulates, such as moose and caribou.\nBison have a life expectancy around 15 years in the wild and up to 25 years in captivity. However, males and females from a hunted population also subject to wolf predation in northern Canada have been reported to live to 22 and 25 years of age, respectively.\nBison have been observed to display homosexual behaviors, males much more so than females. In the case of males, it is unlikely to be related to dominance, but rather to social bonding or gaining sexual experience.\nHorning.\nBison mate in late spring and summer in more open plain areas. During fall and winter, bison tend to gather in more wooded areas. During this time, bison partake in horning behaviors. They rub their horns against trees, young saplings, and even utility poles. Aromatic trees like cedars and pine seem to be preferred. Horning appears to be associated with insect defense, as it occurs most often in the fall when the insect population is at its highest. Cedar and pines emit an aroma after bison horn them and this seems to be used as a deterrent for insects.\nWallowing behavior.\nA bison wallow is a shallow depression in the soil, which bison use either wet or dry. Bison roll in these depressions, covering themselves with dust or mud. Past and current hypotheses to explain the purpose of wallowing include grooming associated with shedding, male-male interaction (typically rutting), social behavior for group cohesion, play, relief from skin irritation due to biting insects, reduction of ectoparasite (tick and lice) load, and thermoregulation. Bison wallowing has important ecosystem engineering effects and enhances plant and animal diversity on prairies.\nPredation.\nWhile often secure from predation because of their size and strength, in some areas, vulnerable individuals are regularly preyed upon by wolves. Wolf predation typically peaks in late winter, when elk migrates south and bison are distressed with heavy snows and shortages of food sources, with attacks usually being concentrated on weakened and injured cows and calves. Wolves more actively target herds with calves than those without. The length of a predation episode varies, ranging from a few minutes to over nine hours. Bison calves use five apparent defense strategies in protecting themselves from wolves: running to a cow, running to a herd, running to the nearest bull, running in the front or center of a stampeding herd, and entering a lake or river or other body of water. When fleeing wolves in open areas, cows with young calves take the lead, while bulls take to the rear of the herds to guard the cows' escape. Bison typically ignore wolves not displaying hunting behavior. Wolf packs specializing in bison tend to have more males because their larger size than females allows them to wrestle prey to the ground more effectively. Healthy, mature bulls in herds rarely fall prey.\nGrizzly bears are known to feed on carcass and may steal wolves' kills. Grizzlies can sometimes kill calves as well as old, injured, or sick adult bison, but direct killing of adult bison is rare even when grizzlies target lone and injured young individuals. Attacking a healthy bison is risky for a bear, who itself may be killed instead.\nDangers to humans.\nBison are among the most dangerous animals encountered by visitors to the various North American national parks and will attack humans if provoked. They appear slow because of their lethargic movements but can easily outrun humans; bison have been observed running as fast as . Bison may approach people for curiosity. Close encounters, including to touch the animals, can be dangerous, and gunshots do not startle them.\nBetween 1980 and 1999, more than three times as many people in Yellowstone National Park were injured by bison than by bears. During this period, bison charged and injured 79 people, with injuries ranging from goring puncture wounds and broken bones to bruises and abrasions. Bears injured 24 people during the same time. Three people died from the injuries inflicted\u2014one person by bison in 1983, and two people by bears in 1984 and 1986.\nGenetics.\nA major problem that bison face today is a lack of genetic diversity due to the population bottleneck the species experienced during its near-extinction in the late 1800s. Another genetic issue is the entry of genes from domestic cattle into the bison population, through hybridization.\nOfficially, the \"American buffalo\" is classified by the United States government as a type of cattle, and the government allows private herds to be managed as such. This is a reflection of the characteristics that bison share with cattle. Though the American bison is a separate species and usually regarded as being in a separate genus from domestic cattle (\"Bos taurus\"), they have a lot of genetic compatibility with cattle. American bison can interbreed with cattle, although only the female offspring are fertile in the first generation. These female hybrids can be bred back to either bison or domestic bulls, resulting in either 1/4 or 3/4 bison young. Female offspring from this cross are also fertile, but males are not reliably fertile unless they are either &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;7\u20448 bison or &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;7\u20448 domestic. Moreover, when they do interbreed, crossbreed animals in the first generation tend to look very much like purebred bison, so appearance is completely unreliable as a means of determining which is a purebred bison, a crossbred cow and a crossbred bison. Many ranchers have deliberately crossbred their cattle with bison, and some natural hybridization could be expected in areas where cattle and bison occur in the same range. Since cattle and bison eat similar food and tolerate similar conditions, they have often been in the same range together in the past, and opportunity for crossbreeding may sometimes have been common.\nIn recent decades, tests were developed to determine the source of mitochondrial DNA in cattle and bison, and most private \"buffalo\" herds were actually crossbred with cattle, and even most state and federal buffalo herds had some cattle DNA. With the advent of nuclear microsatellite DNA testing, the number of herds known to contain cattle genes has increased. As of 2011, though about 500,000 bison existed on private ranches and in public herds, perhaps only 15,000 to 25,000 of these bison were pure and not actually bison-cattle hybrids. DNA from domestic cattle (\"Bos taurus\") has been found in almost all examined bison herds.\nSignificant public bison herds that do not appear to have hybridized domestic cattle genes are the Yellowstone Park bison herd, the Henry Mountains bison herd, which was started with bison taken from Yellowstone Park, the Wind Cave bison herd, and the Wood Buffalo National Park bison herd and subsidiary herds started from it, in Canada.\nA landmark study of bison genetics performed by James Derr of Texas A&amp;M University corroborated this. The Derr study was undertaken in an attempt to determine what genetic problems bison might face as they repopulate former areas, and it noted that bison seem to be adapting successfully, despite their apparent genetic bottleneck. One possible explanation for this might be the small amount of domestic cattle genes that are now in most bison populations, though this is not the only possible explanation for bison success.\nIn the study, cattle genes were also found in small amounts throughout most national, state, and private herds. \"The hybridization experiments conducted by some of the owners of the five foundation herds of the late 1800s, have left a legacy of a small amount of cattle genetics in many of our existing bison herds,\" said Derr. \"All of the state owned bison herds tested (except for possibly one) contain animals with domestic cattle mtDNA.\"\nIt appears that the one state herd that had no cattle genes was the Henry Mountains bison herd; the Henry Mountain herd was started initially with transplanted animals from Yellowstone Park. However, the extension of this herd into the Book Cliffs of central Utah involved mixing the founders with additional bison from another source, so it is not known if the Book Cliffs extension of the herd is also free of cattle hybridization.\nA separate study by Wilson and Strobeck, published in \"Genome\", was done to define the relationships between different herds of bison in the United States and Canada, and to determine whether the bison at Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada and the Yellowstone Park bison herd were possibly separate subspecies. The Wood Buffalo Park bison were determined to actually be crossbreeds between plains and wood bison, but their predominant genetic makeup was that of the expected \"wood buffalo\". However, the Yellowstone Park bison herd was pure plains bison, and not any of the other previously suggested subspecies. Another finding was that the bison in the Antelope Island herd in Utah appeared to be more distantly related to other plains bison in general than any other plains bison group that was tested, though this might be due to genetic drift caused by the small size of only 12 individuals in the founder population. A side finding of this was that the Antelope Island bison herd appears to be most closely related to the Wood Buffalo National Park bison herd, though the Antelope Island bison are actually plains bison.\nIn order to bolster the genetic diversity of the American bison, the National Park Service alongside the Department of the Interior announced the 2020 Bison Conservation Initiative on May 7, 2020. This initiative focuses on maintaining the genetic diversity of the metapopulation rather than individual herds. Small populations of bison are at considerably larger risk due to their decreased gene pool and are susceptible to catastrophic events more so than larger herds. The 2020 Bison Conservation Initiative aims to translocate up to three bison every five to ten years between the Department of the Interior's herds. Specific smaller herds will require a more intense management plan. Translocated bison will also be screened for any health defects such as infection of brucellosis bacteria as to not put the larger herd at risk.\nPopulation bottleneck and near extinction.\nBison went from numbering an estimated 60 million individuals before the 1870s to becoming nearly extinct in the 1880s. This was due to the mass slaughtering of bison during the 1870s, which caused the plains bison population to undergo a population bottleneck. The bottleneck resulted in a founding population of around 100 individuals, split into six herds, five of which were managed by private ranchers and one managed by the New York Zoological Park (now the Bronx Zoo). Additionally, a wild herd consisting of 25 individuals in Yellowstone National Park survived the bottleneck.\nEach of the privately ranched herds had an initial effective population size (Ne) of an estimated 5 to 7 individuals, for a total combined effective population size of between 30 and 50 individuals, from which all of the modern plains bison descend. While these herds have remained mostly isolated, some more than others, there has been some interbreeding between the herds over the past 150 years.\nThe conservation efforts and copious amounts of data taken on American bison populations allow for American bison to serve as a useful study case of population bottlenecking and its effects. This is especially true of the Texas State Bison Herd, which underwent very extreme genetic bottlenecking, with a founding population of only 5 individuals.\nTexas State Bison Herd.\nThe Texas State Bison Herd (TSBH), also known as the Goodnight herd, was established by Charles Goodnight in the mid-1880s with five wild-caught calves. In 1887, the herd consisted of 13 individuals; in 1910, the population consisted of 125 individuals; and in the 1920s, the population ranged from 200 to 250 individuals. In 1929, Goodnight died and the herd switched hands multiple times, leaving the population of the herd unknown from 1930 until the herd was donated to the State of Texas in 1997, with a population of 36 individuals, solely descended from the original five calves. By 2002, the population of the TSBH consisted of 40 individuals and had concerningly low birth rates and high rates of calf mortality. This led to extra attention being given to this herd by conservationists who then performed significant amounts of genetic testing.\nGoodnight was an advocate for the hybridization of bison with cattle, in the hopes of creating a stronger and healthier breed. When the herd was donated to the State of Texas, genetic testing revealed that 6 out of 36 individuals still carried cattle mitochondrial DNA.\nResearchers found that the average number of alleles per locus and the heterozygosity levels (a measure of genetic diversity, where high heterozygosity is representative of high genetic diversity) for the TSBH were significantly lower than that of the Yellowstone National Park bison population and the Theodore Roosevelt National Park bison population. Additionally, of the 54 nuclear microsatellites that were examined, the TSBH had 8 monomorphic loci (i.e., each loci had only one allele), whereas in both the Yellowstone and Theodore Roosevelt herds there was only one monomorphic locus, indicating a much lower level of genetic diversity in the TSBH. The Yellowstone herd had an average number of alleles per locus of 4.75, the Theodore Roosevelt National Park herd had an average of 4.15 alleles per locus, but the TSBH only had an average of 2.54 alleles per locus, statistically significantly lower than the others. The heterozygosity level of the Yellowstone, Theodore Roosevelt, and TSBH populations were 0.63, 0.57, and 0.38 respectively, with the TSBH again having a statistically significantly lower value. This low genetic diversity found in TSBH is likely due to the critically low starting population, several additional bottlenecks throughout the herd's history\u2013leading to inbreeding depression\u2013, and a continuously low population allowing for genetic drift to have a large effect. Before any addition of new individuals, the rate of loss of genetic diversity was estimated to be between 30 and 40% over the proceeding 50 years.\nThe inbreeding depression resulting from the multiple extreme population bottlenecks in the TSBH led to a coefficient of inbreeding of 0.367, equal to the level of inbreeding that results from two generations of full-siblings mating.\nThe Texas State Bison Herd is also a useful example of the deleterious effects of extreme population bottlenecking, with an average natality rate of 0.376 offspring per female and a 1st-year mortality rate of 52.6% from 1997 to 2002, compared to an average natality rate of 0.560 offspring per female and a 1st-year mortality rate of 4.2% for the other bison herds.\nAdditionally, if it were not for the intervention of conservationists, the Texas State Bison Herd would have most likely gone extinct, as the population bottleneck would have proven to be too severe. Multiple population models based on the genetics of the TSBH in the early 2000s predicted a 99% chance of extinction of the TSBH in less than 50 years, with an estimation in 2004 giving the TSBH a 99% chance of extinction in 41 years without the introduction of any outside individuals (Halbert et al. 2004). Importantly for conservation, another simulation predicted that the addition of multiple (3\u20139) outside male bison into the herd would increase genetic diversity enough to give the herd a 100% chance of surviving for another 100 years.\nConservation efforts have led the current TSBH population to be at the carrying capacity of their habitat, at around 300 individuals.\nYellowstone National Park Bison Herd.\nThe Yellowstone National Park Bison herd started with only 25 individuals, and there was evidence of two population bottlenecking events from 1896 to 1912, with a population ranging between 25 and 50 individuals during this time. In 1902, 18 female and 3 male bison from outside herds\u2013the Pablo-Allard herd and Goodnight (TSBH) herds respectively\u2013were introduced to the Yellowstone herd. After the addition of those individuals, the effective population size is estimated to have been Ne=7.2 individuals. The Yellowstone herd was kept completely isolated from 1902 to around 1920, and these previously mentioned founders contributed between 60 and 70% of the genetics of the current bison population at Yellowstone.\nSimilar to the Texas State Bison Herd, the introduction of new individuals into the population in 1902 likely was the savior of this herd, which now numbers around 5,900 individuals as of summer 2022.\nPopulation recovery.\nFrom the late 19th century onwards, the bison population gradually rose from 325 in 1884 to 500,000 in 2017, as a result of careful preservation and a general population boom. Although they are no longer classified as endangered, there are still conservation efforts in order to prevent population crashes down the line.\nHunting.\nBuffalo hunting, i.e. hunting of the American bison, was an activity fundamental to the Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains, providing more than 150 uses for all parts of the animal, including being a major food source, hides for clothing and shelter, bones and horns as tools as well as ceremonial and adornment uses. Bison hunting was later adopted by American professional hunters, as well as by the U.S. government, in an effort to sabotage the central resource of some American Indian Nations during the later portions of the American Indian Wars, leading to the near-extinction of the species around 1890. For many tribes the buffalo was an integral part of life\u2014something guaranteed to them by the Creator. In fact, for some Plains indigenous peoples, bison are known as the first people. The concept of species extinction was foreign to many tribes.\nThus, when the U.S. government began to massacre the buffalo, it was particularly harrowing to the Indigenous people. As Crow chief Plenty Coups described it: \"When the buffalo went away the hearts of my people fell to the ground, and they could not lift them up again. After this nothing happened. There was little singing anywhere.\" Spiritual loss was rampant; bison were an integral part of traditional tribal societies, and they would frequently take part in ceremonies for each bison they killed to honor its sacrifice. In order to boost morale during this time, Sioux and other tribes took part in the Ghost Dance, which consisted of hundreds of people dancing until 100 persons were lying unconscious.\nMany conservation measures have been taken by Native Americans, with the Inter Tribal Bison Council being one of the most significant. Formed in 1990, it comprises 56 tribes in 19 states. These tribes represent a collective herd of more than 15,000 bison and focus on reestablishing herds on tribal lands in order to promote culture, revitalize spiritual solidarity, and restore the ecosystem. Some Inter Tribal Bison Council members argue that the bison's economic value is one of the main factors driving its resurgence. Bison serve as a low-cost substitute for cattle, and they can withstand the winters in the Plains region far easier than cattle.\nAs livestock.\nBison are increasingly raised for meat, hide, wool, and dairy products. The majority of American bison in the world are raised for human consumption or fur clothing. Bison meat is generally considered to taste very similar to beef, but is lower in fat and cholesterol, yet higher in protein than beef, which has led to the development of beefalo, a fertile hybrid of bison and domestic cattle. In 2005, about 35,000 bison were processed for meat in the U.S., with the National Bison Association and USDA providing a \"Certified American Buffalo\" program with birth-to-consumer tracking of bison via RFID ear tags. There is kosher bison meat; these bison are slaughtered at one of the few kosher mammal slaughterhouses in the U.S., and the meat is then distributed nationwide.\nBison are found in publicly and privately held herds. Custer State Park in South Dakota is home to 1,500 bison, one of the largest publicly held herds in the world, but some question the genetic purity of the animals. Wildlife officials believe that free roaming herds with minimal cattle introgression on public lands in North America can be found only in: the Yellowstone Park bison herd; the Henry Mountains bison herd at the Book Cliffs and Henry Mountains in Utah; at Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota; Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana; Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary in the Northwest Territories; Elk Island National Park and Wood Buffalo National Park in Alberta; Grasslands National Park and Prince Albert National Park in Saskatchewan. \nAnother population, the Antelope Island bison herd on Antelope Island in Utah, consisting of 550 to 700 bison, is also one of the largest and oldest public herds in the United States, but the bison in that herd are considered to be only semifree roaming, since they are confined to the Antelope Island. In addition, recent genetic studies indicate that, like most bison herds, the Antelope Island bison herd has a small number of genes from domestic cattle. In 2002, the United States government donated some bison calves from South Dakota and Colorado to the Mexican government. Their descendants live in the Mexican nature reserves El Uno Ranch at Janos and Santa Elena Canyon, Chihuahua, and Boquillas del Carmen, Coahuila, located near the southern banks of the Rio Grande, and around the grassland state line with Texas and New Mexico.\nRecent genetic studies of privately owned herds of bison show that many of them include animals with genes from domestic cattle. For example, the herd on Santa Catalina Island, California, isolated since 1924 after being brought there for a movie shoot, were found to have cattle introgression. As few as 12,000 to 15,000 pure bison are estimated to remain in the world. The numbers are uncertain because the tests used to date\u2014mitochondrial DNA analysis\u2014indicate only if the maternal line (back from mother to mother) ever included domesticated bovines, thus say nothing about possible male input in the process. Most hybrids were found to look exactly like purebred bison; therefore, appearance is not a good indicator of genetics.\nThe size of the Canadian domesticated herd (genetic questions aside) grew dramatically through the 1990s and 2000s. The 2006 Census of Agriculture reported the Canadian herd at 195,728 head, a 34.9% increase since 2001. Of this total, over 95% were located in Western Canada, and less than 5% in Eastern Canada. Alberta was the province with the largest herd, accounting for 49.7% of the herd and 45.8% of the farms. The next-largest herds were in Saskatchewan (23.9%), Manitoba (10%), and British Columbia (6%). The main producing regions were in the northern parts of the Canadian prairies, specifically in the parkland belt, with the Peace River region (shared between Alberta and British Columbia) being the most important cluster, accounting for 14.4% of the national herd. Canada also exports bison meat, totaling in 2006.\nA proposal known as Buffalo Commons has been suggested by a handful of academics and policymakers to restore large parts of the drier portion of the Great Plains to native prairie grazed by bison. Proponents argue that current agricultural use of the shortgrass prairie is not sustainable, pointing to periodic disasters, including the Dust Bowl, and continuing significant human population loss over the last 60 years. However, this plan is opposed by some who live in the areas in question.\nDomestication.\nDespite being the closest relatives of domestic cattle native to North America, bison were never domesticated by Native Americans. Later attempts of domestication by Europeans prior to the 20th century met with limited success. Bison were described as having a \"wild and ungovernable temper\"; they can jump close to vertically, and run when agitated. This agility and speed, combined with their great size and weight, makes bison herds difficult to confine, as they can easily escape or destroy most fencing systems, including most razor wire. The most successful systems involve large, fences made from welded steel I beams sunk at least into concrete. These fencing systems, while expensive, require very little maintenance. Furthermore, making the fence sections overlap so the grassy areas beyond are not visible prevents the bison from trying to get to new range.\nIt has been alleged that the Aztec emperor Moctezuma II kept a bison at his private zoo (\"Totocalli\") in Tenochtitlan, observed by the first Spanish conquistadors in the region; this would provide proof of Native Americans keeping bison in captivity, serve as an extremely far range extension south, and be the very first observation of bison by European colonists. These claims originate from Juan D\u00edaz de Sol\u00eds's interpretation of Bernal Diaz del Castillo's accounts of the \"totocalli\", in which de Sol\u00eds claims the conquistadors observed \"\"the Mexican Bull; a wonderful composition of divers Animals\".\" However, further analysis of del Castillo's account shows no such mention of such an animal, and the mention of this \"Mexican Bull\" was likely an embellishment by de Sol\u00eds.\nAs a symbol.\nNative Americans.\nAmong many Native American tribes, especially the Plains Indians, the bison is considered a sacred animal and religious symbol. According to University of Montana anthropology and Native American studies professor S. Neyooxet Greymorning, \"The creation stories of where buffalo came from put them in a very spiritual place among many tribes. The buffalo crossed many different areas and functions, and it was utilized in many ways. It was used in ceremonies, as well as to make tipi covers that provided homes for people, utensils, shields, weapons and parts were used for sewing with the sinew.\" The Sioux consider the birth of a white buffalo to be the return of White Buffalo Calf Woman, their primary cultural prophet and the bringer of their \"Seven Sacred Rites\". Among the Mandan and Hidatsa, the White Buffalo Cow Society was the most sacred of societies for women.\nNorth America.\nThe American bison is often used in North America in official seals, flags, and logos. In 2016, the American bison became the national mammal of the United States. The bison is a popular symbol in the Great Plains states: Kansas, Oklahoma, and Wyoming have adopted the animal as their official state mammal, and many sports teams have chosen the bison as their mascot. In Canada, the bison is the official animal of the province of Manitoba and appears on the Manitoba flag. It is also used in the official coat of arms of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\nSeveral American coins feature the bison, most famously on the reverse side of the \"buffalo nickel\" from 1913 to 1938. In 2005, the United States Mint coined a nickel with a new depiction of the bison as part of its \"Westward Journey\" series. The Kansas and North Dakota state quarters, part of the \"50 State Quarter\" series, each feature bison. The Kansas state quarter has only the bison and does not feature any writing, while the North Dakota state quarter has two bison. The Montana state quarter prominently features a bison skull over a landscape. The Yellowstone National Park quarter also features a bison standing next to a geyser.\nOther institutions which have adopted the bison as a symbol or mascot include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "49726", "revid": "591714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49726", "title": "Alternating group", "text": "Group of even permutations of a finite set\nIn mathematics, an alternating group is the group of even permutations of a finite set. The alternating group on a set of n elements is called the alternating group of degree n, or the alternating group on n letters and denoted by A\"n\" or Alt(\"n\").\nBasic properties.\nFor \"n\" &gt; 1, the group A\"n\" is the commutator subgroup of the symmetric group S\"n\" with index 2 and has therefore \"n\"!/2 elements. It is the kernel of the signature group homomorphism sgn : S\"n\" \u2192 {1, \u22121} explained under symmetric group.\nThe group A\"n\" is abelian if and only if \"n\" \u2264 3 and simple if and only if \"n\" = 3 or \"n\" \u2265 5. A5 is the smallest non-abelian simple group, having order 60, and thus the smallest non-solvable group.\nThe group A4 has the Klein four-group V as a proper normal subgroup, namely the identity and the double transpositions {(), (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}, that is the kernel of the surjection of A4 onto A3 \u2245 Z3. We have the exact sequence V \u2192 A4 \u2192 A3 = Z3. In Galois theory, this map, or rather the corresponding map S4 \u2192 S3, corresponds to associating the Lagrange resolvent cubic to a quartic, which allows the quartic polynomial to be solved by radicals, as established by Lodovico Ferrari.\nConjugacy classes.\nAs in the symmetric group, any two elements of A\"n\" that are conjugate by an element of A\"n\" must have the same cycle shape. The converse is not necessarily true, however. If the cycle shape consists only of cycles of odd length with no two cycles the same length, where cycles of length one are included in the cycle type, then there are exactly two conjugacy classes for this cycle shape .\nExamples:\n\"See Symmetric group\".\nRelation with symmetric group.\nAs finite symmetric groups are the groups of all permutations of a set with finite elements, and the alternating groups are groups of even permutations, alternating groups are subgroups of finite symmetric groups.\nGenerators and relations.\nFor \"n\" \u2265 3, A\"n\" is generated by 3-cycles, since 3-cycles can be obtained by combining pairs of transpositions. This generating set is often used to prove that A\"n\" is simple for \"n\" \u2265 5.\nAutomorphism group.\nFor \"n\" &gt; 3, except for \"n\" = 6, the automorphism group of A\"n\" is the symmetric group S\"n\", with inner automorphism group A\"n\" and outer automorphism group Z2; the outer automorphism comes from conjugation by an odd permutation.\nFor \"n\" = 1 and 2, the automorphism group is trivial. For \"n\" = 3 the automorphism group is Z2, with trivial inner automorphism group and outer automorphism group Z2.\nThe outer automorphism group of A6 is the Klein four-group V = Z2 \u00d7 Z2, and is related to the outer automorphism of S6. The extra outer automorphism in A6 swaps the 3-cycles (like\u00a0(123)) with elements of shape 32 (like\u00a0(123)(456)).\nExceptional isomorphisms.\nThere are some exceptional isomorphisms between some of the small alternating groups and small groups of Lie type, particularly projective special linear groups. These are:\nMore obviously, A3 is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z3, and A0, A1, and A2 are isomorphic to the trivial group (which is also SL1(\"q\") = PSL1(\"q\") for any \"q\").\nExample A5 as a subgroup of 3-space rotations.\nA5 is the group of isometries of a dodecahedron in 3-space, so there is a representation A5 \u2192 SO3(R).\nIn this picture the vertices of the polyhedra represent the elements of the group, with the center of the sphere representing the identity element. Each vertex represents a rotation about the axis pointing from the center to that vertex, by an angle equal to the distance from the origin, in radians. Vertices in the same polyhedron are in the same conjugacy class. Since the conjugacy class equation for A5 is 1 + 12 + 12 + 15 + 20 = 60, we obtain four distinct (nontrivial) polyhedra.\nThe vertices of each polyhedron are in bijective correspondence with the elements of its conjugacy class, with the exception of the conjugacy class of (2,2)-cycles, which is represented by an icosidodecahedron on the outer surface, with its antipodal vertices identified with each other. The reason for this redundancy is that the corresponding rotations are by \u03c0 radians, and so can be represented by a vector of length \u03c0 in either of two directions. Thus the class of (2,2)-cycles contains 15 elements, while the icosidodecahedron has 30 vertices.\nThe two conjugacy classes of twelve 5-cycles in A5 are represented by two icosahedra, of radii 2\u03c0/5 and 4\u03c0/5, respectively. The nontrivial outer automorphism in Out(A5) \u2243 Z2 interchanges these two classes and the corresponding icosahedra.\nExample: the 15 puzzle.\nIt can be proved that the 15 puzzle, a famous example of the sliding puzzle, can be represented by the alternating group A15, because the combinations of the 15 puzzle can be generated by 3-cycles. In fact, any 2\"k\" \u2212 1 sliding puzzle with square tiles of equal size can be represented by A2\"k\"\u22121.\nSubgroups.\nA4 is the smallest group demonstrating that the converse of Lagrange's theorem is not true in general: given a finite group \"G\" and a divisor \"d\" of |\"G\"|, there does not necessarily exist a subgroup of \"G\" with order \"d\": the group \"G\" = A4, of order 12, has no subgroup of order 6. A subgroup of three elements (generated by a cyclic rotation of three objects) with any distinct nontrivial element generates the whole group.\nFor all \"n\" &gt; 4, A\"n\" has no nontrivial (that is, proper) normal subgroups. Thus, A\"n\" is a simple group for all \"n\" &gt; 4. A5 is the smallest non-solvable group.\nGroup homology.\nThe group homology of the alternating groups exhibits stabilization, as in stable homotopy theory: for sufficiently large \"n\", it is constant. However, there are some low-dimensional exceptional homology. Note that the homology of the symmetric group exhibits similar stabilization, but without the low-dimensional exceptions (additional homology elements).\n\"H\"1: Abelianization.\nThe first homology group coincides with abelianization, and (since A\"n\" is perfect, except for the cited exceptions) is thus:\n\"H\"1(A\"n\", Z) = Z1 for \"n\" = 0, 1, 2;\n\"H\"1(A3, Z) = A = A3 = Z3;\n\"H\"1(A4, Z) = A = Z3;\n\"H\"1(A\"n\", Z) = Z1 for \"n\" \u2265 5.\nThis is easily seen directly, as follows. A\"n\" is generated by 3-cycles \u2013 so the only non-trivial abelianization maps are A\"n\" \u2192 Z3, since order-3 elements must map to order-3 elements \u2013 and for \"n\" \u2265 5 all 3-cycles are conjugate, so they must map to the same element in the abelianization, since conjugation is trivial in abelian groups. Thus a 3-cycle like (123) must map to the same element as its inverse (321), but thus must map to the identity, as it must then have order dividing 2 and 3, so the abelianization is trivial.\nFor \"n\" &lt; 3, A\"n\" is trivial, and thus has trivial abelianization. For A3 and A4 one can compute the abelianization directly, noting that the 3-cycles form two conjugacy classes (rather than all being conjugate) and there are non-trivial maps A3 \u21a0 Z3 (in fact an isomorphism) and A4 \u21a0 Z3.\n\"H\"2: Schur multipliers.\nThe Schur multipliers of the alternating groups A\"n\" (in the case where \"n\" is at least 5) are the cyclic groups of order 2, except in the case where \"n\" is either 6 or 7, in which case there is also a triple cover. In these cases, then, the Schur multiplier is (the cyclic group) of order 6. These were first computed in .\n\"H\"2(A\"n\", Z) = Z1 for \"n\" = 1, 2, 3;\n\"H\"2(A\"n\", Z) = Z2 for \"n\" = 4, 5;\n\"H\"2(A\"n\", Z) = Z6 for \"n\" = 6, 7;\n\"H\"2(A\"n\", Z) = Z2 for \"n\" \u2265 8.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

If any total ordering of \"X\" is fixed, the parity (oddness or evenness) of a permutation formula_1 of \"X\" can be defined as the parity of the number of inversions for\u00a0\"\u03c3\", i.e., of pairs of elements \"x\",\u2009\"y\" of \"X\" such that \"x\" &lt; \"y\" and \"\u03c3\"(\"x\") &gt; \"\u03c3\"(\"y\").\nThe sign, signature, or signum of a permutation\u00a0\"\u03c3\" is denoted sgn(\"\u03c3\") and defined as +1 if \"\u03c3\" is even and \u22121 if \"\u03c3\" is odd. The signature defines the alternating character of the symmetric group S\"n\". Another notation for the sign of a permutation is given by the more general Levi-Civita symbol (\"\u03b5\"\"\u03c3\"), which is defined for all maps from \"X\" to \"X\", and has value zero for non-bijective maps.\nThe sign of a permutation can be explicitly expressed as\nsgn(\"\u03c3\") = (\u22121)\"N\"(\"\u03c3\")\nwhere \"N\"(\"\u03c3\") is the number of inversions in\u00a0\"\u03c3\".\nAlternatively, the sign of a permutation\u00a0\"\u03c3\" can be defined from its decomposition into the product of transpositions as\nsgn(\"\u03c3\") = (\u22121)\"m\"\nwhere \"m\" is the number of transpositions in the decomposition. Although such a decomposition is not unique, the parity of the number of transpositions in all decompositions is the same, implying that the sign of a permutation is well-defined.\nExample.\nConsider the permutation \"\u03c3\" of the set {1,\u20092,\u20093,\u20094,\u20095} defined by formula_2 formula_3 formula_4 formula_5 and formula_6 In one-line notation, this permutation is denoted 34521. It can be obtained from the identity permutation 12345 by three transpositions: first exchange the numbers 2 and 4, then exchange 3 and 5, and finally exchange 1 and 3. This shows that the given permutation \"\u03c3\" is odd. Following the method of the cycle notation article, this could be written, composing from right to left, as\n formula_7\nThere are many other ways of writing \"\u03c3\" as a composition of transpositions, for instance\n\"\u03c3\" = (1 5)(3 4)(2 4)(1 2)(2 3),\nbut it is impossible to write it as a product of an even number of transpositions.\nProperties.\nThe identity permutation is an even permutation. An even permutation can be obtained as the composition of an even number (and only an even number) of exchanges (called transpositions) of two elements, while an odd permutation can be obtained by (only) an odd number of transpositions.\nThe following rules follow directly from the corresponding rules about addition of integers:\nFrom these it follows that\nConsidering the symmetric group S\"n\" of all permutations of the set {1, ..., \"n\"}, we can conclude that the map\nsgn: S\"n\" \u2192 {\u22121, 1}\nthat assigns to every permutation its signature is a group homomorphism.\nFurthermore, we see that the even permutations form a subgroup of S\"n\". This is the alternating group on \"n\" letters, denoted by A\"n\". It is the kernel of the homomorphism sgn. The odd permutations cannot form a subgroup, since the composite of two odd permutations is even, but they form a coset of A\"n\" (in S\"n\").\nIf \"n\" &gt; 1, then there are just as many even permutations in S\"n\" as there are odd ones; consequently, A\"n\" contains \"n\"!/2 permutations. (The reason is that if \"\u03c3\" is even then (1 \u200a2)\"\u03c3\" is odd, and if \"\u03c3\" is odd then (1 \u200a2)\"\u03c3\" is even, and these two maps are inverse to each other.)\nA cycle is even if and only if its length is odd. This follows from formulas like\nformula_8\nIn practice, in order to determine whether a given permutation is even or odd, one writes the permutation as a product of disjoint cycles. The permutation is odd if and only if this factorization contains an odd number of even-length cycles.\nAnother method for determining whether a given permutation is even or odd is to construct the corresponding permutation matrix and compute its determinant. The value of the determinant is the same as the parity of the permutation.\nEvery permutation of odd order must be even. The permutation (1 2)(3 4) in A4 shows that the converse is not true in general.\nEquivalence of the two definitions.\nThis section presents proofs that the parity of a permutation \"\u03c3\" can be defined in two equivalent ways:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Proof 1\nLet \"\u03c3\" be a permutation on a ranked domain \"S\". Every permutation can be produced by a sequence of transpositions (2-element exchanges). Let the following be one such decomposition\n\"\u03c3\" = \"T\"1 \"T\"2 ... \"T\"\"k\"\nWe want to show that the parity of \"k\" is equal to the parity of the number of inversions of \"\u03c3\".\nEvery transposition can be written as a product of an odd number of transpositions of adjacent elements, e.g.\n(2\u200a5) = (2\u200a3)\u2009(3\u200a4)\u2009(4\u200a5)\u2009(4\u200a3)\u2009(3\u200a2).\nGenerally, we can write the transposition (\"i\"\u00a0\"i+d\") on the set {1...,\"i\"...,\"i+d\"...} as the composition of 2\"d\"\u22121 adjacent transpositions by recursion on \"d\":\nIf we decompose in this way each of the transpositions \"T\"1\u00a0...\u00a0\"T\"\"k\" above, we get the new decomposition:\n\"\u03c3\" = \"A\"1 \"A\"2 ... \"Am\"\nwhere all of the \"A\"1...\"Am\" are adjacent. Also, the parity of \"m\" is the same as that of \"k\".\nThis is a fact: for all permutation \"\u03c4\" and adjacent transposition \"a,\" \"a\u03c4\" either has one less or one more inversion than \"\u03c4\". In other words, the parity of the number of inversions of a permutation is switched when composed with an adjacent transposition.\nTherefore, the parity of the number of inversions of \"\u03c3\" is precisely the parity of \"m\", which is also the parity of \"k\". This is what we set out to prove.\nWe can thus define the parity of \"\u03c3\" to be that of its number of constituent transpositions in any decomposition. And this must agree with the parity of the number of inversions under any ordering, as seen above. Therefore, the definitions are indeed well-defined and equivalent.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Proof 2\nAn alternative proof uses the Vandermonde polynomial\nformula_9\nSo for instance in the case \"n\" = 3, we have\nformula_10\nNow for a given permutation\u00a0\"\u03c3\" of the numbers {1,\u2009...,\u2009\"n\"}, we define\nformula_11\nSince the polynomial formula_12 has the same factors as formula_13 except for their signs, it follows that sgn(\"\u03c3\") is either +1 or \u22121. Furthermore, if \"\u03c3\" and \"\u03c4\" are two permutations, we see that\n formula_14\nIt can be shown that any transposition of two elements has signature \u22121, and thus we do indeed recover the signature as defined earlier.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Proof 3\nA third approach uses the presentation of the group S\"n\" in terms of generators \"\u03c4\"1, ..., \"\u03c4\"\"n\"\u22121 and relations\nAs the transposition itself supplies formula_19 inversion, and all others supply 0 (mod 2) inversions, a transposition changes the parity of the number of inversions.\nOther definitions and proofs.\nThe parity of a permutation of formula_20 points is also encoded in its cycle structure.\nLet \"\u03c3\" = (\"i\"1 \"i\"2 ... \"i\"\"r\"+1)(\"j\"1 \"j\"2 ... \"j\"\"s\"+1)...(\"\u2113\"1 \"\u2113\"2 ... \"\u2113\"\"u\"+1) be the unique decomposition of \"\u03c3\" into disjoint cycles, which can be composed in any order because they commute. A cycle (\"a\" \"b\" \"c\" ... \"x\" \"y\" \"z\") involving \"k\" + 1 points can always be obtained by composing \"k\" transpositions (2-cycles):\nformula_21\nso call \"k\" the \"size\" of the cycle, and observe that, under this definition, transpositions are cycles of size 1. From a decomposition into \"m\" disjoint cycles we can obtain a decomposition of \"\u03c3\" into \"k\"1 + \"k\"2 + ... + \"k\"\"m\" transpositions, where \"k\"\"i\" is the size of the \"i\"th cycle. The number \"N\"(\"\u03c3\") = \"k\"1 + \"k\"2 + ... + \"k\"\"m\" is called the discriminant of \"\u03c3\", and can also be computed as\nformula_22\nif we take care to include the fixed points of \"\u03c3\" as 1-cycles.\nSuppose a transposition (\"a\" \"b\") is applied after a permutation \"\u03c3\". When \"a\" and \"b\" are in different cycles of \"\u03c3\" then\nformula_23,\nand if \"a\" and \"b\" are in the same cycle of \"\u03c3\" then\nformula_24.\nIn either case, it can be seen that \"N\"((\"a\" \"b\")\"\u03c3\") = \"N\"(\"\u03c3\") \u00b1 1, so the parity of \"N\"((\"a\" \"b\")\"\u03c3\") will be different from the parity of \"N\"(\"\u03c3\").\nIf \"\u03c3\" = \"t\"1\"t\"2 ... \"t\"\"r\" is an arbitrary decomposition of a permutation \"\u03c3\" into transpositions, by applying the \"r\" transpositions formula_25 after \"t\"2 after ... after \"t\"\"r\" after the identity (whose \"N\" is zero) observe that \"N\"(\"\u03c3\") and \"r\" have the same parity. By defining the parity of \"\u03c3\" as the parity of \"N\"(\"\u03c3\"), a permutation that has an even length decomposition is an even permutation and a permutation that has one odd length decomposition is an odd permutation.\nGeneralizations.\nParity can be generalized to Coxeter groups: one defines a length function \u2113(\"v\"), which depends on a choice of generators (for the symmetric group, adjacent transpositions), and then the function \"v\" \u21a6 (\u22121)\u2113(\"v\") gives a generalized sign map.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With an estimated population of 827,526 residents as of 2024, San Francisco proper is the fourth-most populous city in the U.S. state of California and the 17th-most populous in the United States. Among U.S. cities proper with over 300,000 residents, San Francisco is ranked second by population density, first by per capita income, and sixth by aggregate income as of 2023. Depending on how its borders are defined, the broader San Francisco metropolitan area or San Francisco Bay Area is home to 4.6\u20139.2\u00a0million residents. In 2024, the U.S. Census Bureau reported an estimated population of 4,648,486 for the city's metropolitan statistical area (13th-largest in the U.S.) and 9,164,058 residents for the larger combined statistical area (5th-largest).\nPrior to European settlement, the modern city proper was inhabited by the Yelamu Ohlone. On June 29, 1776, settlers from New Spain established the Presidio of San Francisco at the Golden Gate, and the Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds a few miles away, both named for Francis of Assisi. The California gold rush of 1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. In 1856, San Francisco became a consolidated city-county. After three-quarters of the city was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and fire, it was quickly rebuilt, hosting the Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition nine years later. In World War II, it was a major port of embarkation for naval service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater. After the war, the confluence of returning servicemen, significant immigration, liberalizing attitudes, the rise of the beatnik and hippie countercultures, the sexual revolution, opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, and other factors led to the Summer of Love and the gay rights movement, cementing San Francisco as a center of liberal activism.\nSan Francisco and the surrounding San Francisco Bay Area are a global center of economic activity and the arts and sciences, spurred by leading universities, high-tech, healthcare, finance, insurance, real estate, and professional services sectors. As of 2020[ [update]], the metropolitan area, with 4.5 million residents, ranked 5th by GDP ($874 billion) and 2nd by GDP per capita ($131,082) across the OECD countries. In 2023, San Francisco proper had a GDP of $263.1 billion and a GDP per capita of $325,000. The city is home to numerous companies\u2014many in the technology sector\u2014including Salesforce, Uber, Airbnb, OpenAI, Levi's, Gap, Dropbox, and Lyft.\nIn 2022, San Francisco had more than 1.7 million international visitors and approximately 20 million domestic ones. It is known for its steep rolling hills and eclectic mix of architecture across varied neighborhoods; its Chinatown and Mission districts; mild climate; and landmarks including the Golden Gate Bridge, cable cars, and Alcatraz. The city is home to educational and cultural institutions such as the University of California, San Francisco, the University of San Francisco, San Francisco State University, the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, the Legion of Honor (museum), the de Young Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Symphony, the San Francisco Ballet, the San Francisco Opera, the SFJAZZ Center, and the California Academy of Sciences. Two major league sports teams, the San Francisco Giants and the Golden State Warriors, play their home games within San Francisco. San Francisco International Airport (SFO) is one of the world's busiest airports, while a light rail and bus network, in tandem with the BART and Caltrain systems, connects nearly every part of San Francisco with the wider region.\nEtymology.\nSan Francisco, which is Spanish for \"Saint Francis\", takes its name from Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds, which in turn was named after Saint Francis of Assisi. The mission received its name in 1776, when it was founded by the Spanish under the leadership of Padre Francisco Pal\u00f3u. The city has officially been known as San Francisco since 1847, when Washington Allon Bartlett, then serving as the city's alcalde, renamed it from Yerba Buena (Spanish for \"Good Herb\"), which had been the name of the first civilian in San Francisco. Earlier in San Francisco's history, the uninhabited area on the northeastern side of San Francisco was called , after the herb that was growing abundantly there. The name Yerba Buena continues to be used in locations in the city, such as on Yerba Buena Island.\nWhen using a nickname or abbreviation, local residents most commonly\u00a0refer to San Francisco as \"the City\" or \"SF.\" Although the nickname \"Frisco\" has a local pedigree dating at least to 1850 and has been used by some local residents in every generation since then, the uses of both \"Frisco\" and the historically more recent \"San Fran\" tend to elicit sharp divisions among residents.\nThe California Cantonese who came for the California Gold Rush named California and specifically San Francisco , , \"Gold Mountain\".\nWhen gold was discovered in Bendigo, Victoria, Australia, it was named \"New Gold Mountain\" (, ) and California and San Francisco as \"Old Gold Mountain\" (, ).\nHistory.\nIndigenous history.\nThe earliest archeological evidence of human habitation in the area that is now known as San Francisco dates to 3000\u00a0BCE. The Yelamu group of the Ramaytush people lived in a few small villages when an overland Spanish exploration party arrived on November 2, 1769, the first documented European visit to San Francisco Bay. The Ohlone name for San Francisco was \"Ahwaste\", meaning \"place at the bay\". The arrival of Spanish colonists, and the establishment of their Mission system, marked the beginning of the assimilation of the Ramaytush people and the decline of their language and culture.\nSpanish era (1769\u20131821).\nThe Spanish Empire claimed San Francisco as part of Las Californias, a province of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The Spanish first arrived in what is now San Francisco on November 2, 1769, when the Portol\u00e1 expedition led by Don Gaspar de Portol\u00e1 and Juan Cresp\u00ed arrived at San Francisco Bay. Having noted the strategic benefits of the area due to its large natural harbor, the Spanish dispatched Pedro Fages in 1770 to find a more direct route to the San Francisco Peninsula from Monterey, which would become part of the El Camino Real route.\nIn 1774, Juan Bautista de Anza arrived to the area to select the sites for a mission and presidio. The first European maritime presence in San Francisco Bay occurred on August 5, 1775, when the Spanish ship \"San Carlos\", commanded by Juan Manuel de Ayala, became the first ship to anchor in the bay.\nSoon after, on March 28, 1776, Anza established the Presidio of San Francisco. On October 9, Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds, also known as Mission Dolores, was founded by Padre Francisco Pal\u00f3u. In 1794, the Presidio established the Castillo de San Joaqu\u00edn, a fortification on the southern side of the Golden Gate, which later came to be known as Fort Point.\nIn 1804, the province of Alta California was created, which included San Francisco. At its peak in 1810\u20131820, the average population at the Mission Dolores settlement was about 1,100 people.\nMexican era (1821\u20131848).\nIn 1821, the Californias were ceded to Mexico by Spain. The extensive California mission system gradually lost its influence during the period of Mexican rule, although it was not until 1833 that the missions would be secularized. Agricultural land became largely privatized as ranchos, as was occurring in other parts of California. Coastal trade increased, including a half-dozen barques from various Atlantic ports which regularly sailed in California waters.\nWith the enactment of the Mexican Secularization Act of 1833, the missions were made to divest themselves of their extensive landholdings and emancipate the indigenous people under their control. As part of the process of secularization, Governor Jos\u00e9 Figueroa opened up San Francisco to civilian settlement. Prior to secularization, the only settlements in San Francisco had been the military settlement at the Presidio and the religious settlement at Mission Dolores. In 1835, the Presidio garrison, commanded by Mariano Vallejo, relocated to the Presidio of Sonoma, which was regarded as needing a greater military presence due the proximity of the Russian settlement at Fort Ross. Only a small detachment remained at the Presidio of San Francisco. Mission Dolores sold most of its property in 1836, retaining only the church and related structures.\nIn 1833, Juana Briones de Miranda was granted a small rancho at El Pol\u00edn Spring, near the Presidio, founding the first non-indigenous civilian household in San Francisco. In 1834, the \"pueblo\" of Yerba Buena was founded. Yerba Buena Cove (named after a native herb) was already a favored anchorage spot and the new settlement and trading post was founded by its shores. Yerba Buena was located in what is now the city's Chinatown and Financial District and was centered on a plaza that is now Portsmouth Square. A land survey of Yerba Buena was made by the Swiss immigrant Jean Jacques Vioget as prelude to the city plan. \nFrancisco de Haro became the first alcalde of Yerba Buena. In 1835, the second alcalde, Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Estudillo, approved the first land grant in Yerba Buena: to William Richardson. Yerba Buena began to attract American and European settlers; an 1842 census listed 21 residents (11%) born in the United States or Europe, as well as one Filipino merchant. \nFollowing the Bear Flag Revolt in Sonoma and the beginning of the U.S. Conquest of California, American forces from the \"USS Portsmouth\" under the command of John B. Montgomery captured Yerba Buena on July 9, 1846, with little resistance from the local Californio population, raising the American flag over Yerba Buena plaza (later renamed Portsmouth Square in commemoration of this event).\nFollowing the capture, U.S. forces appointed both Jos\u00e9 de Jes\u00fas No\u00e9 and Washington Allon Bartlett to serve as co-alcaldes (mayors), while the conquest continued on in the rest of California. On January 30, 1847, Mayor Bartlett ordained that the city should officially change its name from \"Yerba Buena\" to \"San Francisco\", as the former name was only locally recognized and the latter name was in use on international maps. There was also concern that a new town being planned by General Vallejo on the Carquinez Strait was to be called \"Francisca\", after the first name of his wife. After the name change to \"San Francisco\", the name of Vallejo's town was changed to Benicia, after his wife's middle name. Following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, Alta California was ceded from Mexico to the United States.\nEarly American era (1848\u20131906).\nDespite its attractive location as a port and naval base, San Francisco under American sovereignty was still a small settlement with inhospitable geography. Situated at the tip of a windswept peninsula without water or firewood, San Francisco lacked most of the basic facilities for a 19th-century settlement. Its 1847 population was said to be 459.\nThe California gold rush brought a flood of treasure seekers. Prospectors accumulated in San Francisco over rival Benicia, raising the population from 1,000 in 1848 to 25,000 by December 1849. The promise of wealth was so strong that crews on arriving vessels deserted and rushed off to the gold fields, leaving behind a forest of masts in San Francisco harbor. Some of these approximately 500 abandoned ships were used at times as storeships, saloons, and hotels; many were left to rot, and some were sunk to establish title to the underwater lot. By 1851, the harbor was extended out into the bay by wharves while buildings were erected on piles among the ships. By 1870, Yerba Buena Cove had been filled to create new land. Buried ships are occasionally exposed when foundations are dug for new buildings.\nCalifornia was quickly granted statehood in 1850, and the U.S. military built Fort Point at the Golden Gate and a fort on Alcatraz Island to secure San Francisco Bay. San Francisco County was one of the state's 18 original counties established at California statehood in 1850. Until 1856, San Francisco's city limits extended west to Divisadero Street and Castro Street, and south to 20th Street. In 1856, the California state government divided the county. A straight line was then drawn across the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula just north of San Bruno Mountain. Everything south of the line became the new San Mateo County while everything north of the line became the new consolidated City and County of San Francisco.\nThe California gold rush triggered a wave of entrepreneurial activity as individuals sought to capitalize on the newfound wealth. The discovery of silver deposits, notably the Comstock Lode in Nevada in 1859, further fueled rapid population growth and economic expansion.\nSan Francisco, as the gateway to the goldfields, experienced a surge in population and commercial activity. However, the influx of fortune seekers also brought challenges. Lawlessness was rampant, and the Barbary Coast district became synonymous with vice, attracting criminals, prostitutes, and illicit activities, including but not limited to prostitution, bootlegging, and gambling. The rapidly growing population, with its lawlessness, gambling and other vices, and the fact that there were no churches to be found, prompted missionaries like William Taylor to come to San Francisco where he began preaching in the streets, using an upright barrel as his pulpit. Taylor garnered enough generous donations from successful gold miners to build a church.\nOne of the most influential figures of this era was William Chapman Ralston. A shrewd banker and investor, Ralston amassed considerable wealth and influence in San Francisco. He gained control over a significant portion of the Comstock Lode's gold and silver mines, establishing a virtual monopoly. Using his incredible clout, Ralston was able to generate millions of dollars for San Francisco during its heady boom years. He founded the Bank of California, the first bank in the Western United States, and built the opulent Palace Hotel, a symbol of San Francisco's newfound prosperity and the largest hotel in the country at the time. His financial empire, however, collapsed in 1875 as a result of the Panic of 1873, triggering a major economic crisis in San Francisco.\nThe resulting unemployment and poverty from the Long Depression led to a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment that culminated in the San Francisco riot of 1877, in which a mob of the city's majority Irish population descended on Chinatown, killing four and causing $100,000 worth of property damage. These events gave rise to the Workingmen's Party of California, led by drayman Denis Kearney and mobilized by his slogan \"The Chinese must go!\" The party elected one third of delegates to California's Second Constitutional Convention (the most of any organized party), rewriting the state constitution to deny Chinese Americans voting rights in California. This agitation paved the way for the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which prohibited all immigration of Chinese laborers to the United States until it was repealed over 60 years later.\nDevelopment of the Port of San Francisco and the establishment in 1869 of overland access to the eastern U.S. rail system via the newly completed Pacific Railroad (the construction of which the city only reluctantly helped support) helped make the Bay Area a center for trade. Catering to the needs and tastes of the growing population, Levi Strauss opened a dry goods business and Domingo Ghirardelli began manufacturing chocolate. Chinese immigrants made the city a polyglot culture, drawn to \"Old Gold Mountain\", creating the city's Chinatown quarter. By 1880, Chinese made up 9.3% of the population. \nThe first cable cars carried San Franciscans up Clay Street in 1873. The city's sea of Victorian houses began to take shape, and civic leaders campaigned for a spacious public park, resulting in plans for Golden Gate Park. San Franciscans built schools, churches, theaters, and all the hallmarks of civic life. The Presidio developed into the most important American military installation on the Pacific coast. \nIn 1890, San Francisco's population approached 300,000, making it the eighth-largest city in the United States at the time. Around 1901, San Francisco was a major city known for its flamboyant style, stately hotels, ostentatious mansions on Nob Hill, and a thriving arts scene. The first North American plague epidemic was the San Francisco plague of 1900\u20131904.\nModern American era (1906\u20131940).\nAt 5:12\u00a0am on April 18, 1906, a major earthquake struck San Francisco and northern California. As buildings collapsed from the shaking, ruptured gas lines ignited fires that spread across the city and burned out of control for several days. With water mains out of service, the Presidio Artillery Corps attempted to contain the inferno by dynamiting blocks of buildings to create firebreaks. More than three-quarters of the city lay in ruins, including almost all of the downtown core. Contemporary accounts reported that 498 people died, though modern estimates put the number in the several thousands. More than half of the city's population of 400,000 was left homeless. Refugees settled temporarily in makeshift tent villages in Golden Gate Park, the Presidio, on the beaches, and elsewhere. Many fled permanently to the East Bay. Jack London is remembered for having famously eulogized the earthquake: \"Not in history has a modern imperial city been so completely destroyed. San Francisco is gone.\"\nRebuilding was rapid and performed on a grand scale. Rejecting calls to completely remake the street grid, San Franciscans opted for speed. Amadeo Giannini's Bank of Italy, later to become Bank of America, provided loans for many of those whose livelihoods had been devastated. The influential San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association or SPUR was founded in 1910 to address the quality of housing after the earthquake. The earthquake hastened development of western neighborhoods that survived the fire, including Pacific Heights, where many of the city's wealthy rebuilt their homes. In turn, the destroyed mansions of Nob Hill became grand hotels. City Hall rose again in the Beaux Arts style, and the city celebrated its rebirth at the Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition in 1915.\nDuring this period, San Francisco built some of its most important infrastructure. Civil Engineer Michael O'Shaughnessy was hired by San Francisco Mayor James Rolph as chief engineer for the city in September 1912 to supervise the construction of the Twin Peaks Reservoir, the Stockton Street Tunnel, the Twin Peaks Tunnel, the San Francisco Municipal Railway, the Auxiliary Water Supply System, and new sewers. San Francisco's streetcar system was pushed to completion by O'Shaughnessy between 1915 and 1927. It was the O'Shaughnessy Dam, Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, and Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct that would have the largest effect on San Francisco. An abundant water supply enabled San Francisco to develop into the city it has become today.\nIn ensuing years, the city solidified its standing as a financial capital; in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash, not a single San Francisco-based bank failed. Indeed, it was at the height of the Great Depression that San Francisco undertook two great civil engineering projects, simultaneously constructing the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge, completing them in 1936 and 1937, respectively. It was in this period that the island of Alcatraz, a former military stockade, began its service as a federal maximum security prison, housing notorious inmates such as Al Capone and Robert Franklin Stroud, the Birdman of Alcatraz. San Francisco later celebrated its regained grandeur with a World's fair, the Golden Gate International Exposition in 1939\u201340, creating Treasure Island in the middle of the bay to house it.\nPostmodern American era (1941\u2013present).\nDuring World War II, the city-owned Sharp Park in Pacifica was used as an internment camp to detain Japanese Americans. Hunters Point Naval Shipyard became a hub of activity, and Fort Mason became the primary port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater of Operations. The explosion of jobs drew many people, especially African Americans from the South, to the area. After the end of the war, many military personnel returning from service abroad and civilians who had originally come to work decided to stay. The United Nations Charter creating the United Nations was drafted and signed in San Francisco in 1945 and, in 1951, the Treaty of San Francisco re-established peaceful relations between Japan and the Allied Powers.\nUrban planning projects in the 1950s and 1960s involved widespread destruction and redevelopment of west-side neighborhoods and the construction of new freeways, of which only a series of short segments were built before being halted by citizen-led opposition. The onset of containerization made San Francisco's small piers obsolete, and cargo activity moved to the larger Port of Oakland. The city began to lose industrial jobs and turned to tourism as the most important segment of its economy. The suburbs experienced rapid growth, and San Francisco underwent significant demographic change, as large segments of the white population left the city, supplanted by an increasing wave of immigration from Asia and Latin America. From 1950 to 1980, the city lost over 10 percent of its population.\nOver this period, San Francisco became a magnet for America's counterculture movement. Beat Generation writers fueled the San Francisco Renaissance and centered on the North Beach neighborhood in the 1950s. Hippies flocked to Haight-Ashbury in the 1960s, reaching a peak with the 1967 Summer of Love. In 1974, the Zebra murders left at least 16 people dead. In the 1970s, the city became a center of the gay rights movement, with the emergence of The Castro as an urban gay village, the election of Harvey Milk to the Board of Supervisors, and his assassination, along with that of Mayor George Moscone, in 1978.\nBank of America, now based in Charlotte, North Carolina, was founded in San Francisco; the bank completed 555 California Street in 1969. The Transamerica Pyramid was completed in 1972, igniting a wave of \"Manhattanization\" that lasted until the late 1980s, a period of extensive high-rise development downtown. The 1980s also saw a dramatic increase in the number of homeless people in the city, an issue that remains today, despite many attempts to address it. \nThe 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake caused destruction and loss of life throughout the Bay Area. In San Francisco, the quake severely damaged structures in the Marina and South of Market districts and precipitated the demolition of the damaged Embarcadero Freeway and much of the damaged Central Freeway. The reconstruction allowed the city to reclaim The Embarcadero as its historic downtown waterfront and revitalizing the Hayes Valley neighborhood.\nThe three recent decades have seen booms driven by the internet industry. During the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, startup companies invigorated the San Francisco economy. Large numbers of entrepreneurs and computer application developers moved into the city, followed by marketing, design, and sales professionals, changing the social landscape as once poorer neighborhoods became increasingly gentrified. Demand for new housing and office space ignited a second wave of high-rise development, this time in the South of Market district. By 2000, the city's population reached new highs, surpassing the previous record set in 1950. When the bubble burst in 2001, many of these companies folded and their employees were laid off. Yet high technology and entrepreneurship remain mainstays of the San Francisco economy. By the mid-2000s (decade), the social media boom had begun, with San Francisco becoming a popular location for tech offices and a common place to live for people employed in Silicon Valley companies such as Apple and Google.\nThe early 2020s saw a reduction of tech companies' presence in Downtown San Francisco in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, increased popularity of working at home, and struggles with homelessness. Although some observers have raised the possibility that office vacancies and declining tax revenues could cause San Francisco to enter an economic doom loop, other sources have refuted this broad-based characterization of the city as a whole, asserting that the issues of concern are restricted primarily to the urban core of San Francisco.\nThe San Francisco Armory, Palace of Fine Arts, Haas\u2013Lilienthal House, and 450 Sutter Street are among the dozens of historical landmarks in the city listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nGeography.\nSan Francisco is located on the West Coast of the United States, at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula and includes significant stretches of the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay within its boundaries. Several picturesque islands\u2014Alcatraz, Treasure Island and the adjacent Yerba Buena Island, and small portions of Alameda Island, Red Rock Island, and Angel Island\u2014are part of the city. Also included are the uninhabited Farallon Islands, offshore in the Pacific Ocean. The mainland within the city limits roughly forms a \"seven-by-seven-mile square\", a common local colloquialism referring to the city's shape, though its total area, including water, is nearly .\nThere are more than 50 hills within the city limits. Some neighborhoods are named after the hill on which they are situated, including Nob Hill, Potrero Hill, and Russian Hill. Near the geographic center of the city, southwest of the downtown area, are a series of less densely populated hills. Twin Peaks, a pair of hills forming one of the city's highest points, forms an overlook spot. San Francisco's tallest hill, Mount Davidson, is high and is capped with a tall cross built in 1934. Dominating this area is Sutro Tower, a large red and white radio and television transmission tower reaching 1,811\u00a0ft (552 m) above sea level.\nThe nearby San Andreas and Hayward Faults are responsible for much earthquake activity, although neither physically passes through the city itself. The San Andreas Fault caused the earthquakes in 1906 and 1989. Minor earthquakes occur on a regular basis. The threat of major earthquakes plays a large role in the city's infrastructure development. The city constructed an auxiliary water supply system and has repeatedly upgraded its building codes, requiring retrofits for older buildings and higher engineering standards for new construction. However, there are still thousands of smaller buildings that remain vulnerable to quake damage. USGS has released the California earthquake forecast which models earthquake occurrence in California.\nSan Francisco's shoreline has grown beyond its natural limits. Entire neighborhoods such as the Marina, Mission Bay, and Hunters Point, as well as large sections of the Embarcadero, sit on areas of landfill. Treasure Island was constructed from material dredged from the bay as well as material resulting from the excavation of the Yerba Buena Tunnel through Yerba Buena Island during the construction of the Bay Bridge. Such land tends to be unstable during earthquakes. The resulting soil liquefaction causes extensive damage to property built upon it, as was evidenced in the Marina district during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. \nA few natural lakes and creeks (Lake Merced, Mountain Lake, Pine Lake, Lobos Creek, El Polin Spring) are within parks and remain protected in what is essentially their original form, but most of the city's natural watercourses, such as Islais Creek and Mission Creek, have been partially or completely culverted and built over. Since the 1990s, the Public Utilities Commission has been studying proposals to daylight or restore some creeks.\nNeighborhoods.\nAn \"Historical Center of San Francisco\" monument,&lt;ref name=\"sfG/rs/unP\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; where the 1899\u20131906 City Hall was once located,&lt;ref name=\"a&amp;A/Csf\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is in United Nations Plaza, at \nThe earliest center of San Francisco is Portsmouth Square, in the northeast quadrant of the city anchored by Market Street and the waterfront. Here in the northeast quadrant, the Financial District is centered, with Union Square, the principal shopping and hotel district, and the Tenderloin nearby. Cable cars carry riders up steep inclines to the summit of Nob Hill, once the home of the city's business tycoons, and down to the waterfront tourist attractions of Fisherman's Wharf, and Pier 39, where many restaurants feature Dungeness crab from a still-active fishing industry. Also in this quadrant are Russian Hill, a residential neighborhood with the famously crooked Lombard Street; North Beach, the city's Little Italy and the former center of the Beat Generation; and Telegraph Hill, which features Coit Tower. Abutting Russian Hill and North Beach is San Francisco's Chinatown, the oldest Chinatown in North America. \nThe South of Market, which was once San Francisco's industrial core, has seen significant redevelopment following the construction of Oracle Park and an infusion of startup companies. New skyscrapers, live-work lofts, and condominiums dot the area. Further development is taking place just to the south in Mission Bay area, a former railroad yard, which now has a second campus of the University of California, San Francisco and Chase Center, which opened in 2019 as the new home of the Golden State Warriors.\nWest of downtown, across Van Ness Avenue, lies the large Western Addition neighborhood, which became established with a large African American population after World War II. The Western Addition is usually divided into smaller neighborhoods including Hayes Valley, the Fillmore, and Japantown, which was once the largest Japantown in North America but suffered when its Japanese American residents were forcibly removed and interned during World War II. The Western Addition survived the 1906 earthquake with its Victorians largely intact, including the famous \"Painted Ladies\", standing alongside Alamo Square. To the south, near the geographic center of the city is Haight-Ashbury, famously associated with 1960s hippie culture.\nNorth of the Western Addition is Pacific Heights, an affluent neighborhood that features the homes built by wealthy San Franciscans in the wake of the 1906 earthquake. Directly north of Pacific Heights facing the waterfront is the Marina, a neighborhood popular with young professionals that was largely built on reclaimed land from the Bay.\nIn the southeast quadrant of the city is the Mission District\u2014populated in the 19th century by Californios and working-class immigrants from Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Scandinavia. In the 1910s, a wave of Central American immigrants settled in the Mission and, in the 1950s, immigrants from Mexico began to predominate. In recent years, gentrification has changed the demographics of parts of the Mission from Latino, to twenty-something professionals. Noe Valley to the southwest and Bernal Heights to the south are both increasingly popular among young families with children. \nEast of the Mission is the Potrero Hill neighborhood, a mostly residential neighborhood that features sweeping views of downtown San Francisco. West of the Mission, the area historically known as Eureka Valley, now popularly called the Castro, was once a working-class Scandinavian and Irish area. It has become North America's first gay village, and is now the center of gay life in the city. \nLocated near the city's southern border, the Excelsior District is one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in San Francisco. The Bayview-Hunters Point in the far southeast corner of the city is one of the poorest neighborhoods, though the area has been the focus of several revitalizing and urban renewal projects.\nThe West Side of the city remained largely undeveloped until the early 20th century, due to the region being isolated from downtown because of the rugged terrain of Twin Peaks, Mount Sutro and Mount Davidson. Vast sand dunes made up the costal plain with the uninhibited area being dubbed the Outside Lands. The creation of Golden Gate Park in 1870\u20131900 contributed to the area being developed. The construction of the Twin Peaks Tunnel in 1918 connected southwest neighborhoods to downtown via streetcar, hastening the development of West Portal, and nearby affluent Forest Hill and St. Francis Wood. Further west, stretching all the way to the Pacific Ocean and north to Golden Gate Park lies the vast Sunset District, a large middle-class area with a predominantly Asian population.\nThe northwestern quadrant of the city contains the Richmond, a mostly middle-class neighborhood north of Golden Gate Park, home to immigrants from other parts of Asia as well as many Russian and Ukrainian immigrants. Together, these areas are known as The Avenues.\nMany piers remained derelict for years until the demolition of the Embarcadero Freeway reopened the downtown waterfront, allowing for redevelopment. The centerpiece of the port, the Ferry Building, while still receiving commuter ferry traffic, has been restored and redeveloped as a gourmet marketplace.\nClimate.\nSan Francisco has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Csb\", Trewartha: \"Csll\"), characteristic of California's coast, with cool, moist winters and mild dry summers with few hot days. San Francisco's weather is strongly influenced by the cool currents of the Pacific Ocean on the west side of the city, and the water of San Francisco Bay to the north and east. This moderates temperature swings and produces a remarkably mild year-round climate with little seasonal temperature variation.\nAmong major U.S. cities, San Francisco has the coolest daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures for June, July, and August. During the summer, rising hot air in California's interior valleys creates a low-pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the Golden Gate, which creates the city's characteristic cool winds and fog. The fog is less pronounced in eastern neighborhoods and during the late summer and early fall. The year's warmest month, on average, is September, and on average, October is warmer than July, especially in daytime.\nTemperatures reach or exceed on an average of only 21 and 23\u00a0days a year at downtown and San Francisco International Airport (SFO), respectively. The dry period of May to October is mild to warm, with the normal monthly mean temperature peaking in September at . The rainy period of November to April is slightly cooler, with the normal monthly mean temperature reaching its lowest in January at . \nOn average, there are 73 rainy days a year, and annual precipitation averages . Variation in precipitation from year to year is high. Above-average rain years are often associated with warm El Ni\u00f1o conditions in the Pacific while dry years often occur in cold water La Ni\u00f1a periods. In 2013 (a \"La Ni\u00f1a\" year), a record low of rainfall was recorded at downtown San Francisco, where records have been kept since 1849. Snowfall in the city is very rare, with only 10 measurable accumulations recorded since 1852, most recently in 1976 when up to fell on Twin Peaks.\nThe highest recorded temperature at the official National Weather Service downtown observation station was on September 1, 2017. During that hot spell, the warmest ever night of was also recorded. The lowest recorded temperature was on December 11, 1932.\nDuring an average year between 1991 and 2020, San Francisco recorded a warmest night at and a coldest day at . The coldest daytime high since the station's opening in 1945 was recorded in December 1972 at .\nAs a coastal city, San Francisco will be heavily affected by climate change. As of 2021[ [update]], sea levels are projected to rise by as much as , resulting in periodic flooding, rising groundwater levels, and lowland floods from more severe storms.\nSan Francisco falls under the USDA 10a Plant hardiness zone, though some areas, particularly downtown, border zone 10b. \nEcology.\nHistorically, tule elk were present in San Francisco County, based on archeological evidence of elk remains in at least five different Native American shellmounds: at Hunter's Point, Fort Mason, Stevenson Street, Market Street, and Yerba Buena. Perhaps the first historical observer record was from the De Anza Expedition on March 23, 1776. Herbert Eugene Bolton wrote about the expedition camp at Mountain Lake, near the southern end of today's Presidio: \"Round about were grazing deer, and scattered here and there were the antlers of large elk.\"\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe 2020 United States census showed San Francisco's population to be 873,965, an increase of 8.5% from the 2010 census. With roughly one-quarter the population density of Manhattan, San Francisco is the second-most densely populated large American city, behind only New York City among cities greater than 200,000 population, and the fifth-most densely populated U.S. county, following only four of the five New York City boroughs.\nSan Francisco is part of the five-county San Francisco\u2013Oakland\u2013Hayward, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area, a region of 4.7\u00a0million people (13th most populous in the U.S.), and has served as its traditional demographic focal point. It is also part of the greater 14-county San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland, CA Combined Statistical Area, whose population is over 9.6\u00a0million, making it the fifth-largest in the United States as of 2018[ [update]].\nRace, ethnicity, religion, and languages.\nAs of the 2020[ [update]] census, the racial makeup and population of San Francisco included: 361,382 Whites (41.3%), 296,505 Asians (33.9%), 46,725 African Americans (5.3%), 86,233 Multiracial Americans (9.9%), 6,475 Native Americans and Alaska Natives (0.7%), 3,476 Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (0.4%) and 73,169 persons of other races (8.4%). There were 136,761 Hispanic or Latino residents of any race (15.6%).\nSan Francisco is a majority minority city, as non-Hispanic White residents comprise less than half of the population; in 1940 they formed 92.5% of the population.\nIn 2010, residents of Chinese ethnicity constituted the largest single ethnic minority group in San Francisco at 21% of the population; other large Asian groups include Filipinos (5%) and Vietnamese (2%), with Japanese, Koreans and many other Asian and Pacific Islander groups represented in the city. The population of Chinese ancestry is most heavily concentrated in Chinatown and the Sunset and Richmond Districts. Filipinos are most concentrated in SoMa and the Crocker-Amazon; the latter neighborhood shares a border with Daly City, which has one of the highest concentrations of Filipinos in North America. The Tenderloin District is home to a large portion of the city's Vietnamese population as well as businesses and restaurants, which is known as the city's Little Saigon.\nThe principal Hispanic groups in the city were those of Mexican (7%) and Salvadoran (2%) ancestry. The Hispanic population is most heavily concentrated in the Mission District, Tenderloin District, and Excelsior District. The city's percentage of Hispanic residents is less than half of that of the state.\nAfrican Americans constituted about 5% of San Francisco's population in 2020; their share of the city's population has been decreasing since the 1970s. The majority of the city's Black residents live in the neighborhoods of Bayview-Hunters Point, Visitacion Valley, and the Fillmore District. There are smaller Black communities in Diamond Heights, Glen Park, and the Mission District.\nUnlike many other Western cities, San Francisco has a significant Irish American population. Drawn by the California Gold Rush, the Irish were one of the first major White immigrant groups to arrive in California, settling in the city of San Francisco. The Irish historically settled in Irish Hill, which was razed following World War II. Despite this, San Francisco is still one of only three counties in the entire Western United States whose White population is plurality (20.6%) Irish.\nThe city has long been home to a significant Jewish community; in 2018 Jewish Americans made up an estimated 10% (80,000) of the city's population. It the third-largest Jewish community in proportional terms in the United States, behind only those of New York City, and Los Angeles, respectively, and it is also relatively young compared to other major U.S. cities. The Jewish community resides throughout the city, but the Richmond District is home to an ethnic enclave of mostly Russian Jews. The Fillmore District was formerly a mostly Jewish neighborhood from the 1920s until the 1970s, when many of its Jewish residents moved to other neighborhoods of the city as well as the suburbs of nearby Marin County.\nIn a 2018 study by the Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco, Jews make up 10% (80,000) of the city's population, making Judaism the second-largest religion in San Francisco after Christianity. In a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, the largest religious groupings in San Francisco's metropolitan area are Christians (48%), followed by those of no religion (35%), Hindus (5%), Jews (3%), Buddhists (2%), Muslims (1%) and a variety of other religions have smaller followings. In 2014, about 20% of residents in the area are Protestant, and 25% professing Roman Catholic beliefs. 10% of the residents in metropolitan San Francisco identify as agnostics, while 5% identify as atheists.\nIn 2010, 55% (411,728) of San Francisco residents spoke only English at home, while 19% (140,302) spoke a variety of Chinese (mostly Taishanese and Cantonese), 12% (88,147) Spanish, 3% (25,767) Tagalog, and 2% (14,017) Russian. In total, 45% (342,693) of San Francisco's population spoke a language at home other than English.\nEthnic clustering.\nSan Francisco has several prominent Chinese, Mexican, and Filipino neighborhoods including Chinatown and the Mission District. In 2017, more than half of the Asian population in San Francisco was either Chinese-born (40.3%) or Philippine-born (13.1%). Of the Mexican population, 21% were Mexican-born. Between 1990 and 2000, the number of foreign-born residents increased from 33% to nearly 40%. During this same period, the San Francisco metropolitan area received 850,000 immigrants, ranking third in the United States after Los Angeles and New York.\nEducation, households, and income.\nOf all major cities in the United States, San Francisco has the second-highest percentage of residents with a college degree, second only to Seattle. Over 44% of adults have a bachelor's or higher degree. San Francisco had the highest rate at 7,031 per square mile, or over 344,000 total graduates in the city's .\nSan Francisco has the highest estimated percentage of gay and lesbian individuals of any of the 50 largest U.S. cities, at 15%. San Francisco also has the highest percentage of same-sex households of any American county, with the Bay Area having a higher concentration than any other metropolitan area.\nSan Francisco ranks third of American cities in median household income with a 2007 value of $65,519. Median family income is $81,136. An emigration of middle-class families has left the city with a lower proportion of children than any other large American city, with the dog population cited as exceeding the child population of 115,000, in 2018. In 2007, San Francisco's poverty rate was 12%, lower than the national average.\nHomelessness has been a chronic problem for San Francisco since the early 1970s.\nThe city is believed to have the highest number of homeless inhabitants per capita of any major U.S. city.\nThere are 345,811 households in the city. 133,366 households (39%) were individuals, 109,437 (32%) were opposite-sex married couples, 63,577 (18%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 21,677 (6%) were unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 10,384 (3%) were same-sex married couples or partnerships. The average household size was 2.26. The average family size was 3.11. 452,986 people (56%) lived in rental housing units. 327,985 people (41%) lived in owner-occupied housing units. The median age is 38 years.\nSan Francisco declared itself a sanctuary city in 1989. City officials strengthened the stance in 2013 with its 'Due Process for All' ordinance. The law declared local authorities could not hold immigrants for immigration offenses if they had no violent felonies on their records and did not currently face charges. The city issues a Resident ID Card regardless of the applicant's immigration status.\nHomelessness.\nHomelessness in San Francisco emerged as a major issue in the late 20th century and remains a growing problem in modern times.\nIn 2019, 8,035 homeless people were counted in San Francisco's point-in-time street and shelter count. This was an increase of more than 17% over the 2017 count of 6,858 people. 5,180 of the people were living unsheltered on the streets and in parks. 26% of respondents in the 2019 count identified job loss as the primary cause of their homelessness, 18% cited alcohol or drug use, and 13% cited being evicted from their residence. \nThe city of San Francisco has been dramatically increasing its spending to service the growing population homelessness crisis: spending jumped by $241 million in 2016\u201317 to total $275 million, compared to a budget of just $34 million the previous year. In 2017\u201318 the budget for combatting homelessness stood at $305 million. In the 2019\u20132020 budget year, the city budgeted $368 million for homelessness services. In the proposed 2020\u20132021 budget, the city budgeted $850 million for homelessness services.\nIn January 2018, a United Nations special rapporteur on homelessness, Leilani Farha, stated that she was \"completely shocked\" by San Francisco's homelessness crisis during a visit to the city. She compared the \"deplorable conditions\" of the homeless camps she witnessed on San Francisco's streets to those she had seen in Mumbai. In May 2020, San Francisco officially sanctioned homeless encampments.\nIn 2024, according to San Francisco's Point-in-Time (PIT) count, the homeless population was approximately 8,323 individuals. Additionally, over 20,000 people in the city were seeking homeless services.\nCrime.\nSan Francisco's violent crime rate is low compared to other major cities.\nIn 2011, 50 murders were reported, which is 6.1 per 100,000 people. There were about 134 rapes, 3,142 robberies, and about 2,139 assaults. There were about 4,469 burglaries, 25,100 thefts, and 4,210 motor vehicle thefts. The Tenderloin area has the highest crime rate in San Francisco: 70% of the city's violent crimes, and around one-fourth of the city's murders, occur in this neighborhood. The Tenderloin also sees high rates of drug abuse, gang violence, and prostitution. \nAnother area with high crime rates is the Bayview-Hunters Point area. In the first six months of 2015 there were 25 murders, compared to 14 in the first six months of 2014. However, the murder rate is still much lower than in past decades. That rate rose again by the close of 2016. According to the San Francisco Police Department, there were 59 murders in the city in 2016, an annual total that marked a 13.5% increase in the number of homicides (52) from 2015. The city has also gained a reputation for car break-ins, with over 19,000 car break-ins occurring in 2021.\nDuring the first half of 2018, human feces on San Francisco sidewalks were the second-most-frequent complaint of city residents, with about 65 calls per day. The city has formed a \"poop patrol\" to attempt to combat the problem.\nSeveral street gangs have operated in the city over the decades, including MS-13, the Sure\u00f1os and Norte\u00f1os in the Mission District.\nAfrican-American street gangs familiar in other cities, including the Bloods, Crips, and their sets, have struggled to establish footholds in San Francisco, while police and prosecutors have been accused of liberally labeling young African-American males as gang members.\nCriminal Triad groups, such as the Wo Hop To, were active in San Francisco in the 20th century. \nAccording to statistics released by SFPD in April 2024, the crime figures were down in the first 100 days of the year, namely in terms of robberies, burglaries and larceny. In the first half of 2024, San Francisco experienced a 32% decrease in overall crime compared to the previous year. Personal property theft saw a 41% reduction, and violent crimes, including gun-related incidents, decreased by 30%.\nEconomy.\nThe city has a diversified service economy, with employment spread across a wide range of professional services, including tourism, financial services, and high technology. In 2016, approximately 27% of workers were employed in professional business services; 14% in leisure and hospitality; 13% in government services; 12% in education and health care; 11% in trade, transportation, and utilities; and 8% in financial activities. In 2023, GDP in the five-county San Francisco metropolitan area grew 3.4% in real terms to $779\u00a0billion. \nIn 2023, the 14-county San Jose\u2013San Francisco\u2013Oakland combined statistical area had a GDP of $1.397\u00a0trillion, ranking 3rd among CSAs, and ahead of all but 15 countries. As of 2023[ [update]], San Francisco County ranked 11th by income per capita among U.S. counties, with a per capita personal income of $164,807. Marin County, directly to the north over the Golden Gate Bridge, and San Mateo County, directly to the south on the Peninsula, were the 7th and 9th highest-income counties respectively.\nThe legacy of the California gold rush turned San Francisco into the principal banking and finance center of the West Coast in the early twentieth century. Montgomery Street in the Financial District became known as the \"Wall Street of the West\", home to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and the site of the now-defunct Pacific Coast Stock Exchange. Bank of America, a pioneer in making banking services accessible to the middle class, was founded in San Francisco and in the 1960s, built the landmark modern skyscraper at 555 California Street for its corporate headquarters, since relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina. \nMany large financial institutions, multinational banks, and venture capital firms are based in or have regional headquarters in the city. With over 30 international financial institutions, six Fortune 500 companies, and a large supporting infrastructure of professional services\u2014including law, public relations, architecture and design\u2014San Francisco is designated as an Alpha(-) World City. The 2024 Global Financial Centres Index ranked San Francisco as the fifth-most competitive financial center in the world.\nBeginning in the 1990s, San Francisco's economy diversified away from finance and tourism towards the growing fields of high tech, biotechnology, and medical research. Technology jobs accounted for just 1 percent of San Francisco's economy in 1990, growing to 4 percent in 2010 and an estimated 8 percent by the end of 2013. San Francisco became a center of Internet start-up companies during the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the subsequent social media boom of the late 2000s (decade). Since 2010, San Francisco proper has attracted an increasing share of venture capital investments as compared to nearby Silicon Valley, attracting 423 financings worth US$4.58\u00a0billion in 2013. In 2004, the city approved a payroll tax exemption for biotechnology companies to foster growth in the Mission Bay neighborhood, site of a second campus and hospital of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Mission Bay hosts the UCSF Medical Center, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, and Gladstone Institutes, as well as more than 40 private-sector life sciences companies.\nAccording to academic Rob Wilson, San Francisco is a global city, a status that pre-dated the city's popularity during the California gold rush. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to high office vacancy rates and the accelerating evacuation of many retail and tech businesses out of the downtown core of San Francisco. Attributed causes include a shift to remote work in the technology and professional services sectors, as well as high levels of homelessness, drug use, and crime in areas around downtown San Francisco, such as the Tenderloin and Mid-Market neighborhoods.\nThe top employer in San Francisco is the city government itself, employing 5.6% (35,000+ people) of the city's workforce, followed by UCSF with over 29,000 employees. The largest private-sector employer is Salesforce, with 11,953 employees, as of 2024[ [update]]. Small businesses with fewer than 10 employees and self-employed firms made up 85% of city establishments in 2006, and the number of San Franciscans employed by firms of more than 1,000 employees has fallen by half since 1977. The growth of national big box and formula retail chains into the city has been made intentionally difficult by political and civic consensus. In an effort to buoy small privately owned businesses in San Francisco and preserve the unique retail personality of the city, the Small Business Commission started a publicity campaign in 2004 to keep a larger share of retail dollars in the local economy, and the Board of Supervisors has used the planning code to limit the neighborhoods where formula retail establishments can set up shop, an effort affirmed by San Francisco voters. However, by 2016, San Francisco was rated low by small businesses in a Business Friendliness Survey.\nLike many U.S. cities, San Francisco once had a significant manufacturing sector employing nearly 60,000 workers in 1969, but nearly all production left for cheaper locations by the 1980s. As of 2014[ [update]], San Francisco has seen a small resurgence in manufacturing, with more than 4,000 manufacturing jobs across 500 companies, doubling since 2011. The city's largest manufacturing employer is Anchor Brewing Company, and the largest by revenue is Timbuk2.\nAs of the first quarter of 2022[ [update]], the median value of homes in San Francisco County was $1,297,030. It ranked third in the U.S. for counties with highest median home value, behind Nantucket, Massachusetts and San Mateo County, California.\nTechnology.\nSan Francisco became a hub for technology-driven economic growth during the internet boom of the 1990s, and still holds an important position in the world city network today. Intense redevelopment towards the \"new economy\" makes business more technologically minded. Between the years of 1999 and 2000, the job growth rate was 4.9%, creating over 50,000 jobs in technology firms and internet content production. However, the technology industry has become geographically dispersed.\nIn the second technological boom driven by social media in the mid-2000s, San Francisco became a location for companies such as Apple, Google, Ubisoft, Facebook, and Twitter (now known as \"X\") to base their tech offices and for their employees to live.\nThe final wave of technology materialized as AI companies have either been founded in the city or moved there attracted to a large talent pool, proximity to venture capital, and serendipitous connections.\nThe Sunset Reservoir Solar Project, completed in 2010, installed 24,000 solar panels on the roof of the reservoir. The 5-megawatt plant more than tripled the city's 2-megawatt solar generation capacity when it opened in December 2010.\nTourism and conventions.\nTourism is one of San Francisco's most important private-sector industries, accounting for more than one out of seven jobs in the city. The city's frequent portrayal in music, film, and popular culture has made the city and its landmarks recognizable worldwide. In 2016, it attracted the fifth-highest number of foreign tourists of any city in the United States. In 2023, 23.1 million visitors arrived in San Francisco, adding US$9.3 billion to the economy.\nWith a large hotel infrastructure and a major convention facility in the Moscone Center, San Francisco is a popular destination for annual conventions and conferences.\nSome of the most popular tourist attractions in San Francisco, as noted by the Travel Channel, include the Golden Gate Bridge and Alamo Square Park, home to the famous \"Painted Ladies\". Both of these locations were often used as landscape shots for the hit American television sitcom \"Full House\". There is also Lombard Street, known for its \"crookedness\" and extensive views. Tourists also visit Pier 39, which offers dining, shopping, entertainment, and views of the bay, sunbathing California sea lions, the Aquarium of the Bay, and the famous Alcatraz Island.\nSan Francisco also offers tourists varied nightlife in its neighborhoods.\nThe new Terminal Project at Pier 27 opened September 25, 2014, as a replacement for the old Pier 35.\nA heightened interest in conventioneering in San Francisco, marked by the establishment of convention centers such as Yerba Buena, acted as a feeder into the local tourist economy and resulted in an increase in the hotel industry: \"In 1959, the city had fewer than thirty-three hundred first-class hotel rooms; by 1970, the number was nine thousand; and by 1999, there were more than thirty thousand.\" The commodification of the Castro District has contributed to San Francisco's tourist economy.\nArts and culture.\nAlthough the Financial District, Union Square, and Fisherman's Wharf are well known around the world, San Francisco is also characterized by its numerous culturally rich streetscapes featuring mixed-use neighborhoods anchored around central commercial corridors to which residents and visitors alike can walk. Because of these characteristics, San Francisco is ranked the \"most walkable\" city in the United States by Walk Score. \nMany neighborhoods feature a mix of businesses, restaurants and venues that cater to the daily needs of local residents while also serving many visitors and tourists. Some neighborhoods are dotted with boutiques, caf\u00e9s and nightlife such as Union Street in Cow Hollow, 24th Street in Noe Valley, Valencia Street in the Mission, Grant Avenue in North Beach, and Irving Street in the Inner Sunset. This approach especially has influenced the continuing South of Market neighborhood redevelopment with businesses and neighborhood services rising alongside high-rise residences.\nSince the 1990s, the demand for skilled information technology workers from local startups and nearby Silicon Valley has attracted white-collar workers from all over the world and created a high standard of living in San Francisco. Many neighborhoods that were once blue-collar, middle, and lower class have been gentrifying, as many of the city's traditional business and industrial districts have experienced a renaissance driven by the redevelopment of the Embarcadero, including the neighborhoods South Beach and Mission Bay. The city's property values and household income have risen to among the highest in the nation, creating a large and upscale restaurant, retail, and entertainment scene. According to a 2014 quality of life survey of global cities, San Francisco has the highest quality of living of any U.S. city. However, due to the exceptionally high cost of living, many of the city's middle and lower-class families have been leaving the city for the outer suburbs of the Bay Area, or for California's Central Valley. By June 2, 2015, the median rent was reported to be as high as $4,225. The high cost of living is due in part to restrictive planning laws which limit new residential construction.\nThe international character that San Francisco has enjoyed since its founding is continued today by large numbers of immigrants from Asia and Latin America. With 39% of its residents born overseas, San Francisco has numerous neighborhoods filled with businesses and civic institutions catering to new arrivals. In particular, the arrival of many ethnic Chinese, which began to accelerate in the 1970s, has complemented the long-established community historically based in Chinatown throughout the city and has transformed the annual Chinese New Year Parade into the largest event of its kind on the West Coast.\nWith the arrival of the \"beat\" writers and artists of the 1950s and societal changes culminating in the Summer of Love in the Haight-Ashbury district during the 1960s, San Francisco became a center of liberal activism and of the counterculture that arose at that time. The Democrats and to a lesser extent the Green Party have dominated city politics since the late 1970s, after the last serious Republican challenger for city office lost the 1975 mayoral election by a narrow margin. San Francisco has not voted more than 20% for a Republican presidential or senatorial candidate since 1988. In 2007, the city expanded its Medicaid and other indigent medical programs into the Healthy San Francisco program, which subsidizes certain medical services for eligible residents.\nSince 1993, the San Francisco Department of Public Health has distributed 400,000 free syringes every month aimed at reducing HIV and other health risks for drug users, as well as providing disposal sites and services.\nSan Francisco also has had a very active environmental community. Starting with the founding of the Sierra Club in 1892 to the establishment of the non-profit Friends of the Urban Forest in 1981, San Francisco has been at the forefront of many global discussions regarding the environment. The 1980 San Francisco Recycling Program was one of the earliest curbside recycling programs. The city's GoSolarSF incentive promotes solar installations and the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission is rolling out the CleanPowerSF program to sell electricity from local renewable sources.

He was a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in 1962 in Stockholm.\nHe received honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Case Western Reserve University in 1969, Princeton University in 1985, and the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York in 1990 in connection with an international symposium in his honor organized by John Corcoran.\nHe was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 1966, to the American Academy of the Arts and Sciences in 1967, to the National Academy of Sciences in 1978.\nChurch was a lifelong member of the Presbyterian church. He died on August 11, 1995, at the age of 92. He is buried in Princeton Cemetery.\nMathematical work.\nChurch is known for the following accomplishments:\nThe lambda calculus emerged in his 1936 paper showing the unsolvability of the Entscheidungsproblem. This result preceded Alan Turing's work on the halting problem, which also demonstrated the existence of a problem unsolvable by mechanical means. Upon hearing of Church's work, Turing enrolled at Princeton later that year under Church for a Ph.D. Church and Turing then showed that the lambda calculus and the Turing machine used in Turing's halting problem were equivalent in capabilities, and subsequently demonstrated a variety of alternative \"mechanical processes for computation.\" This resulted in the Church\u2013Turing thesis.\nThe efforts for automatically generating a controller implementation from specifications originates from his ideas.\nThe lambda calculus influenced the design of Lisp and functional programming languages in general. The Church encoding is named in his honor.\nIn his honor the Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation was established in 2015 by the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group for Logic and Computation (ACM SIGLOG), the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS), the European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL), and the Kurt G\u00f6del Society (KGS). The award is for an outstanding contribution to the field published within the past 25 years and must not yet have received recognition via another major award, such as the Turing Award, the Paris Kanellakis Award, or the G\u00f6del Prize.\nChurch also made contributions to the theory of random sequences.\nPhilosophical work.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Church\u2019s elaboration of a methodology involving the logistic method, his philosophical criticisms of nominalism and his defense of realism, his argumentation leading to conclusions about the theory of meaning, and the detailed construction of the Fregean and Russellian intensional logics, are more than sufficient to place him high up among the most important philosophers of this century.\u2014\u200a Church is also known for the Frege-Church ontology, which he created based on the philosophical ideas of Gottlob Frege. He is credited with formulating the Slingshot Argument, which suggests that sentential references must be truth-values, rather than propositions.\nInfluence.\nOver the course of his academic career, Church oversaw 31 doctoral students. Many of them have led distinguished careers in mathematics, computer science, and other academic subjects, including Peter B. Andrews, George A. Barnard, David Berlinski, William W. Boone, Martin Davis, Alfred L. Foster, Leon Henkin, John G. Kemeny, Stephen C. Kleene, Simon B. Kochen, Maurice L'Abb\u00e9, Gary R. Mar, Michael O. Rabin, Nicholas Rescher, Hartley Rogers, Jr., J. Barkley Rosser, Dana Scott, Raymond Smullyan and Alan Turing.\nIn addition to those he directly supervised, Church also had a large influence on other mathematicians and computer scientists. Haskell Curry, who expanded on Church's ideas with the concept of currying, stated that one of his textbooks, Introduction to Mathematical Logic (first published in 1944), was \"written with the meticulous precision which characterizes the author's work generally.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Australia manages the secretariat.\nThe initial members of the group had different assessments of which chemical precursors should be subject to export control. Later adherents initially had no such controls. Today, members of the group maintain export controls on a uniform list of 90 compounds, including several that are not prohibited for export under the Chemical Weapons Convention, but can be used in the manufacture of chemical weapons. Additionally, the Australia Group expanded its standardization of licensing and export controls to cover technology related to the manufacturing of chemical weapons or controlled components.\nIn 2002, the group took two important steps to strengthen export control. The first was the \"no-undercut\" requirement, which stated that any member of the group considering making an export to another state that had already been denied an export by any other member of the group must first consult with that member state before approving the export. The second was the \"catch-all\" provision, which requires member states to halt all exports that could be used by importers in chemical or biological weapons programs, regardless of whether the export is on the group's control lists.

It has since become a widespread and highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary. Ballet has been influential globally and has defined the foundational techniques which are used in many other dance genres and cultures. Various schools around the world have incorporated their own cultures. As a result, ballet has evolved in distinct ways.\nA \"ballet\" as a unified work comprises the choreography and music for a ballet production. Ballets are choreographed and performed by trained ballet dancers. Traditional classical ballets are usually performed with classical music accompaniment and use elaborate costumes and staging, whereas modern ballets are often performed in simple costumes and without elaborate sets or scenery.\nEtymology.\nBallet is a French word which had its origin in Italian \"balletto\", a diminutive of \"ballo\" (dance) which comes from Latin \"ballo\", \"ballare\", meaning \"to dance\", which in turn comes from the Greek \"\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03c9\" (\"ballizo\"), \"to dance, to jump about\". The word came into English usage from the French around 1630.\nIn French, the word refers to a ballet performance, a ballet work, and possibly to the dance genre itself, although the expression \"danse classique\" also exists for the latter meaning, is less equivocal and is more commonly used when referring to the learning of this dance.\nHistory.\nBallet originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Under Catherine de' Medici's influence as Queen, it spread to France, where it developed even further. The dancers in these early court ballets were mostly noble amateurs. Ornamented costumes were meant to impress viewers, but they restricted performers' freedom of movement.\nThe ballets were performed in large chambers with viewers on three sides. The implementation of the proscenium arch from 1618 on distanced performers from audience members, who could then better view and appreciate the technical feats of the professional dancers in the productions.\nFrench court ballet reached its height under the reign of King Louis XIV. Louis founded the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Danse (Royal Dance Academy) in 1661 to establish standards and certify dance instructors. In 1672, Louis XIV made Jean-Baptiste Lully the director of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique (Paris Opera) from which the first professional ballet company, the Paris Opera Ballet, arose. Pierre Beauchamp served as Lully's ballet-master. Together their partnership would drastically influence the development of ballet, as evidenced by the credit given to them for the creation of the five major positions of the feet. By 1681, the first \"ballerinas\" took the stage following years of training at the Acad\u00e9mie.\nBallet started to decline in France after 1830, but it continued to develop in Denmark, Italy, and Russia. The arrival in Europe of the Ballets Russes led by Sergei Diaghilev on the eve of the First World War revived interest in the ballet and started the modern era.\nIn the twentieth century, ballet had a wide influence on other dance genres, Also in the twentieth century, ballet took a turn dividing it from classical ballet to the introduction of modern dance, leading to modernist movements in several countries.\nFamous dancers of the twentieth century include \nMikhail Baryshnikov,\nErik Bruhn,\nMaria Tall Chief,\nJeanne Devereaux,\nSuzanne Farrell,\nMargot Fonteyn,\nRosella Hightower,\nGelsey Kirkland,\nNatalia Makarova,\nArthur Mitchell,\nRudolf Nureyev,\nAnna Pavlova,\nMaya Plisetskaya,\nand \nGalina Ulanova.\nStyles.\nStylistic variations and subgenres have evolved over time. Early, classical variations are primarily associated with geographic origin. Examples of this are Russian ballet, French ballet, and Italian ballet. Later variations, such as contemporary ballet and neoclassical ballet, incorporate both classical ballet and non-traditional technique and movement. Perhaps the most widely known and performed ballet style is late Romantic ballet (or Ballet blanc).\nClassical ballet.\nClassical ballet is based on traditional ballet technique and vocabulary. Different styles have emerged in different countries, such as French ballet, Italian ballet, English ballet, and Russian ballet. Several of the classical ballet styles are associated with specific training methods, typically named after their creators (see below). The Royal Academy of Dance method is a ballet technique and training system that was founded by a diverse group of ballet dancers. They merged their respective dance methods (Italian, French, Danish and Russian) to create a new style of ballet that is unique to the organization and is recognized internationally as the English style of ballet. Some examples of classical ballet productions are: \"Swan Lake\", \"The Sleeping Beauty\" and \"The Nutcracker.\"\nRomantic ballet.\nRomantic ballet was an artistic movement of classical ballet and several productions remain in the classical repertoire today. The Romantic era was marked by the emergence of pointe work, the dominance of female dancers, and longer, flowy tutus that attempt to exemplify softness and a delicate aura. This movement occurred during the early to mid-nineteenth century (the Romantic era) and featured themes that emphasized intense emotion as a source of aesthetic experience. The plots of many romantic ballets revolved around spirit women (sylphs, wilis, and ghosts) who enslaved the hearts and senses of mortal men. The 1827 ballet \"La Sylphide\" is widely considered to be the first, and the 1870 ballet \"Copp\u00e9lia\" is considered to be the last. Famous ballet dancers of the Romantic era include Marie Taglioni, Fanny Elssler, and Jules Perrot. Jules Perrot is also known for his choreography, especially that of \"Giselle\", often considered to be the most widely celebrated romantic ballet.\nNeoclassical ballet.\nNeoclassical ballet is usually abstract, with no clear plot, costumes or scenery. Music choice can be diverse and will often include music that is also neoclassical (e.g. Stravinsky, Roussel). Tim Scholl, author of \"From Petipa to Balanchine\", considers George Balanchine's \"Apollo\" in 1928 to be the first neoclassical ballet. \"Apollo\" represented a return to form in response to Sergei Diaghilev's abstract ballets. Balanchine worked with modern dance choreographer Martha Graham, and brought modern dancers into his company such as Paul Taylor, who in 1959 performed in Balanchine's \"Episodes\".\nWhile Balanchine is widely considered the face of neoclassical ballet, there were others who made significant contributions. Frederick Ashton's \"Symphonic Variations\" (1946) is a seminal work for the choreographer. Set to C\u00e9sar Franck's score of the same title, it is a pure-dance interpretation of the score.\nAnother form, Modern Ballet, also emerged as an offshoot of neoclassicism. Among the innovators in this form were Glen Tetley, Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino. While difficult to parse modern ballet from neoclassicism, the work of these choreographers favored a greater athleticism that departed from the delicacy of ballet. The physicality was more daring, with mood, subject matter and music more intense. An example of this would be Joffrey's \"Astarte\" (1967), which featured a rock score and sexual overtones in the choreography.\nContemporary ballet.\nThis ballet style is often performed barefoot. Contemporary ballets may include mime and acting, and are usually set to music (typically orchestral but occasionally vocal). It can be difficult to differentiate this form from neoclassical or modern ballet. Contemporary ballet is also close to contemporary dance because many contemporary ballet concepts come from the ideas and innovations of twentieth-century modern dance, including floor work and turn-in of the legs. The main distinction is that ballet technique is essential to perform a contemporary ballet.\nGeorge Balanchine is considered to have been a pioneer of contemporary ballet. Another early contemporary ballet choreographer, Twyla Tharp, choreographed \"Push Comes To Shove\" for the American Ballet Theatre in 1976, and in 1986 created \"In The Upper Room\" for her own company. Both of these pieces were considered innovative for their melding of distinctly modern movements with the use of pointe shoes and classically trained dancers.\nToday there are many contemporary ballet companies and choreographers. These include Alonzo King and his company LINES Ballet; Matthew Bourne and his company New Adventures; Complexions Contemporary Ballet; Nacho Duato and his Compa\u00f1ia Nacional de Danza; William Forsythe and The Forsythe Company; and Ji\u0159\u00ed Kyli\u00e1n of the Nederlands Dans Theater. Traditionally \"classical\" companies, such as the Mariinsky (Kirov) Ballet and the Paris Opera Ballet, also regularly perform contemporary works.\nThe term \"ballet\" has evolved to include all forms associated with it. Someone training as a ballet dancer will now be expected to perform neoclassical, modern and contemporary work. A ballet dancer is expected to be able to be stately and regal for classical work, free and lyrical in neoclassical work, and unassuming, harsh or pedestrian for modern and contemporary work. In addition, there are several modern varieties of dance that fuse classical ballet technique with contemporary dance, such as Hiplet, that require dancers to be practised in non-Western dance styles.\nTechnical methods of ballet instruction.\nThere are six widely used, internationally recognized methods to teach or study ballet. These methods are the French School, the Vaganova Method, the Cecchetti Method, the Bournonville method, the Royal Academy of Dance method (English style), and the Balanchine method (American style). Many more schools of technique exist in various countries.\nAlthough preschool-age children are a lucrative source of income for a ballet studio, ballet instruction is generally not appropriate for young children. Initial instruction requires standing still and concentrating on posture, rather than dancing. Because of this, many ballet programs have historically not accepted students until approximately age 8. Creative movement and non-demanding pre-ballet classes are recommended as alternatives for children.\nFrench method.\nThe French method is the basis of all ballet training. When Louis XIV created the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Danse in 1661, he helped to create the codified technique still used today by those in the profession, regardless of what method of training they adhere to. The French school was particularly revitalized under Rudolf Nureyev, in the 1980s. His influence revitalized and renewed appreciation for this style, and has drastically shaped ballet as a whole. In fact, the French school is now sometimes referred to as Nureyev school. The French method is often characterized by technical precision, fluidity and gracefulness, and elegant, clean lines. For this style, fast footwork is often utilized in order to give the impression that the performers are drifting lightly across the stage. Two important trademarks of this technique are the specific way in which the port de bras and the \u00e9paulement are performed, more rounded than when dancing in a Russian style, but not as rounded as the Danish style.\nVaganova method.\nThe Vaganova method is a style of ballet training that emerged from Russian ballet, created by Agrippina Vaganova. After retiring from dance in 1916, Vaganova turned to teaching at the Leningrad Choreographic School in 1921. Her training method is now internationally recognized and her book, \"The Fundamentals of Classical Dance\" (1934), is a classic reference. This method is marked by the fusion of the classical French style, specifically elements from the Romantic era, with the athleticism of the Italian method, and the soulful passion of Russian ballet. She developed an extremely precise method of instruction in her book \"Basic Principles of Russian Classical dance\" (1948). This includes outlining when to teach technical components to students in their ballet careers, for how long to focus on it, and the right amount of focus at each stage of the student's career. These textbooks continue to be extremely important to the instruction of ballet today.\nThe method emphasizes development of strength, flexibility, and endurance for the proper performance of ballet. She espoused the belief that equal importance should be placed on the arms and legs while performing ballet, as this will bring harmony and greater expression to the body as a whole.\nCecchetti method.\nDeveloped by Enrico Cecchetti (1850\u20131928), this method is one known internationally for its intense reliance of the understanding of anatomy as it relates to classical ballet. The goal of this method is to instill important characteristics for the performance of ballet into students so that they do not need to rely on imitations of teachers. Important components for this method is the emphasis of balance, elevations, ballon, poise, and strength.\nThis method espouses the importance of recognizing that all parts of the body move together to create beautiful, graceful lines, and as such cautions against thinking of ballet in terms of the arms, legs, and neck and torso as separate parts. This method is well known for eight port de bras that are utilized.\nBournonville method.\nThe Bournonville method is a Danish method first devised by August Bournonville. Bournonville was heavily influenced by the early French ballet method due to his training with his father, Antoine Bournonville and other important French ballet masters. This method has many style differences that differentiate it from other ballet methods taught today. A key component is the use of diagonal \u00e9paulements, with the upper body turning towards the working foot typically. This method also incorporates very basic use of arms, pirouettes from a low d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 position into seconde, and use of fifth position bras en bas for the beginning and end of movements.\nThe Bournonville method produces dancers who have beautiful \"ballon\" (\"the illusion of imponderable lightness\").\nThe Royal Academy of Dance method (RAD).\nThe Royal Academy of Dance method, also referred to as the English style of ballet, was established in 1920 by Genee, Karsavina, Bedells, E Espinosa, and Richardson. The goal of this method is to promote academic training in classical ballet throughout Great Britain. This style also spread to the United States, and is widely utilized still today. There are specific grade levels which a student must move through in order to complete training in this method. The key principle behind this method of instruction is that basic ballet technique must be taught at a slow pace, with difficulty progression often much slower than the rest of the methods. The idea behind this is if a student is to put in a large amount of effort into perfecting the basic steps, the technique learned in these steps allow a student to utilize harder ones at a much easier rate.\nBalanchine method.\nDeveloped by George Balanchine at the New York City Ballet. His method draws heavily on his own training as a dancer in Russia. The technique is known for extreme speed throughout routines, emphasis on lines, and deep pli\u00e9s. Perhaps one of the most well known differences of this style is the unorthodox positioning of the body. Dancers of this style often have flexed hands and even feet, and are placed in off-balance positions. Important ballet studios teaching this method are the Miami City Ballet, Ballet Chicago Studio company, and the School of American Ballet in New York.\nCostumes.\nBallet costumes play an important role in the ballet community. They are often the only survival of a production, representing a living imaginary picture of the scene.\nRenaissance and Baroque.\nThe roots of ballet go back to the Renaissance in France and Italy when court wear was the beginning of ballet costumes. Ballet costumes have been around since the early 15th century. Cotton and silk were mixed with flax, woven into semitransparent gauze to create exquisite ballet costumes.\n17th century.\nDuring the 17th century, different types of fabrics and designs were used to make costumes more spectacular and eye catching. Court dress still remained for women during this century. Silks, satins and fabrics embroidered with real gold and precious stones increased the level of spectacular decoration associated with ballet costumes. Women's costumes also consisted of heavy garments and knee-long skirts which made it difficult for them to create much movement and gesture.\n18th century.\nDuring the 18th century, stage costumes were still very similar to court wear but progressed over time, mostly due to the French dancer and ballet-master Jean-Georges Noverre (1727\u20131810) whose proposals to modernize ballet are contained in his revolutionary \"Lettres sur la danse et les ballets\" (1760). Noverre's book altered the emphasis in a production away from the costumes towards the physical movements and emotions of the dancers.\nEuropean ballet was centered in the Paris Opera. During this era, skirts were raised a few inches off the ground. Flowers, flounces, ribbons, and lace emphasized this opulent feminine style, as soft pastel tones in citron, peach, pink, and pistachio dominated the color range.\n19th century.\nDuring the early 19th century, close-fitting body costumes, floral crowns, corsages, and jewels were used. Ideals of Romanticism were reflected through female movements.\nCostumes became much tighter as corsets started to come into use, to show off the curves on a ballerina. Jewels and bedazzled costumes became much more popular.\n20th century.\nDuring the 20th century, ballet costumes transitioned back to the influence of Russian ballet. Ballerina skirts became knee-length tutus, later on in order to show off their precise pointe work. Colors used on stage costumes also became much more vibrant. Designers used colors such as red, orange, yellow, etc. to create visual expression when ballet dancers perform on stage.\nBallet as a career.\nProfessional dancers are generally not well paid, and earn less money than a typical worker. As of 2020, American dancers (including ballet and other dance forms) were paid an average of US$19 per hour, with pay somewhat better for teachers than for performers.\nThe job outlook is not strong, and the competition to get a job is intense, with the number of applicants vastly exceeding the number of job openings. Most jobs involve teaching in private dance schools.\nChoreographers are paid better than dancers. Musicians and singers are paid better per hour than either dancers or choreographers, about US$30 per hour; however, full-time work is unusual for musicians.\nHealth effects.\nTeenage girl ballet dancers are prone to stress fractures in the first rib. Posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS) most commonly affects people who perform repetitive plantar flexion, such as ballet dancers. Eating disorders are thought to be common, and a 2014 meta-analysis suggests that studies do indicate that ballet dancers are at higher risk than the general population for several kinds of eating disorders. In addition, some researchers have noted that intensive training in ballet results in lower bone mineral density in the arms.\nCriticism.\nMost ballet choreography is written so that it can only be performed by a relatively young dancer. The structure of ballet \u2013 in which a (usually) male choreographer or director uses (mostly) women's bodies to express his artistic vision, has been criticized as harming women.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Trade credit facilitates the purchase of supplies without immediate payment. Trade credit is commonly used by business organizations as a source of short-term financing. It is granted to those customers who have a reasonable amount of financial standing and goodwill. (Kuveya, 2020)\nThere are many forms of trade credit in common use. Various industries use various specialized forms. They all have, in common, the collaboration of businesses to make efficient use of capital to accomplish various business objectives.\nTrade credit is the largest use of capital for a majority of business-to-business (B2B) sellers in the United States and is a critical source of capital for a majority of all businesses. For example, Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world, has used trade credit as a larger source of capital than bank borrowings; trade credit for Wal-Mart is 8 times the amount of capital invested by shareholders.\nExample.\nThe operator of an ice cream stand may sign a franchising agreement, under which the distributor agrees to provide ice cream stock under the terms \"net 60\" with a ten percent discount on payment within 30 days, and a 20% discount on payment within 10 days. This means that the operator has 60 days to pay the invoice in full. If sales are good within the first week, the operator may be able to send a cheque for all or part of the invoice, and make an extra 20% on the ice cream sold. However, if sales are slow, leading to a month of low cash flow, then the operator may decide to pay within 30 days, obtaining a 10% discount, or use the money for another 30 days and pay the full invoice amount within 60 days.\nIf the ice cream distributor for its part were to receive trade credit from milk and sugar suppliers on terms of net 30 and 2% discount if paid within ten days, it would appear it were taking a loss or disadvantageous position in this web of trade credit balances. The ice cream distributor may be willing to do so if it has a substantial markup on the ingredients and other costs of production of the ice cream it sells to the operator, but there exists more than one reason to manage trade credit terms for the benefit of a business, and more than one way to do so. The ice cream distributor may be well-capitalized either from the owners' investment or from accumulated profits, and may be looking to expand his markets. They may be aggressive in attempting to locate new customers or to help them get established. It is not in their best interests for customers to go out of business from cash flow instabilities, so their financial terms aim to accomplish two things:\nAlternatives.\nOne alternative to straightforward trade credit is when a supplier offers to give product on consignment to a trader e.g. a gift shop. The terms of the arrangement mean that the original supplier retains ownership of the goods until the shop sells them.\nTrade credit has been identified as a critical source of short-term financing for listed manufacturing companies.

With a population of about 146,000 (as of 2024[ [update]]), Bern is the fifth-most populous city in Switzerland, behind Z\u00fcrich, Geneva, Basel and Lausanne. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000.\nBern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second-most populous of Switzerland's cantons. The city\u2019s official language is German. The main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Bernese German. In 1983, the historic old town (in ) in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is notably surrounded by the Aare, a major river of the Swiss Plateau.\nAlthough fortified settlements were established since antiquity, the medieval city proper was founded by the Z\u00e4hringer ruling family, probably in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen. Bern was made a free imperial city in 1218 and, in 1353, it joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming one of its eight early cantons. Since then, Bern became a large city-state and a prominent actor of Swiss history by pursuing a policy of sovereign territorial expansion. Since the 15th century, the city was progressively rebuilt and acquired its current characteristics. Bern was made the Federal City in 1848. From about 5,000 inhabitants in the 15th century, the city passed the 100,000 mark in the 1920s.\nEtymology.\nThe etymology of the name \"Bern\" is uncertain. According to the local legend, based on folk etymology, Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen, the founder of the city of Bern, vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, and this turned out to be a bear (Middle High German ). It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona, which at the time was known as \"Bern\" in Middle High German. The city was sometimes referred to as \"Bern im \u00dcechtland\" to distinguish it from Verona. As a result of the finding of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s, it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin, possibly \"*berna\" \"cleft\". The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s. The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the \"B\u00e4rengraben\" dates to the 1440s.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nNo archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today's city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far. In antiquity, a Celtic \"oppidum\" stood on the \"Engehalbinsel\" (peninsula) north of Bern, fortified since the second century BC (late La T\u00e8ne period), thought to be one of the 12 \"oppida\" of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar. During the Roman era, a Gallo-Roman \"vicus\" was on the same site. The Bern zinc tablet has the name \"Brenodor\" (\"dwelling of Breno\"). In the Early Middle Ages, a settlement in B\u00fcmpliz, now a city district of Bern, was some from the medieval city.\nThe medieval city is a foundation of the Z\u00e4hringer ruling family, which rose to power in Upper Burgundy in the 12th century. According to 14th-century historiography (\"Cronica de Berno\", 1309), Bern was founded in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen.\nIn 1218, after Berthold died without an heir, Bern was made a free imperial city by the \"Goldene Handfeste\" of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.\nOld Swiss Confederacy.\nIn 1353, Bern joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming the eighth canton of the formative period of 1353 to 1481.\nBern invaded and conquered Aargau in 1415 and Vaud in 1536, as well as other smaller territories, thereby becoming the largest city-state north of the Alps. By the 18th century, it comprised most of what is today the canton of Bern and the canton of Vaud.\nThe city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the river Aare. The \"Zytglogge\" tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256, when the \"K\u00e4figturm\" took over this role until 1345. It was succeeded by the \"Christoffelturm\" (formerly located closer to the site of the modern-day railway station) until 1622. During the Thirty Years' War, two new fortifications \u2013 the so-called big and small \"Schanze\" (entrenchments) \u2013 were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula.\nAfter a major blaze in 1405, the city's original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by half-timbered houses, and subsequently the sandstone buildings which came to be characteristic for the Old Town. Despite waves of pestilence that hit Europe in the 14th century, the city continued to grow, mainly due to immigration from the surrounding countryside.\nDuring the 18th century, the city of Bern was at one point the largest shareholder in the South Sea Company, a British joint-stock company which was involved in the Atlantic slave trade. From 1689 to 3 March 1798 in the town was printed, in French, the biweekly newspaper \"Gazette de Berne\", which reflected the opinions of Bern, usually hostile to the politics of Pre-revolutionary France.\nModern history.\nBern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars, when it was stripped of parts of its territories. It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802, and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814, it newly acquired the Bernese Jura. At this time, it once again became the largest canton of the Confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979.\nOn 28 November 1848, during the revolutions that year, a majority of the new Swiss Federal Assembly deputies chose Bern as the Federal City (seat of the government) of the newly created Swiss federal state, ahead of Z\u00fcrich and Lucerne. Bern was chosen as not to concentrate all the power in the economic powerhouse of Z\u00fcrich, while Catholic and conservative Lucerne had been part of the Sonderbund during the war a year before. In addition, Bern had a more central location and was supported by the French-speaking cantons due to proximity to them. However, the constitution doesn't define Bern as official capital of Switzerland, but as the seat of government.\nA number of congresses of the socialist First and Second Internationals were held in Bern, particularly during World War I when Switzerland was neutral; see Bern International.\nThe city's population rose from about 5,000 in the 15th century to about 12,000 by 1800 and to above 60,000 by 1900, passing the 100,000 mark during the 1920s. Population peaked during the 1960s at 165,000 and has since decreased slightly, to below 130,000 by 2000. As of September 2017, the resident population stood at 142,349, of which 100,000 were Swiss citizens and 42,349 (31%) resident foreigners. A further estimated 350,000 people live in the immediate urban agglomeration.\nGeography and climate.\nTopography.\nBern lies on the Swiss plateau in the canton of Bern, slightly west of the centre of Switzerland and north of the Bernese Alps.

The site of the old observatory in Bern is the point of origin of the CH1903 coordinate system at .\nThe city was originally built on a hilly peninsula surrounded by the river Aare, but outgrew natural boundaries by the 19th century. A number of bridges have been built to allow the city to expand beyond the Aare.\nBern is built on very uneven ground. An elevation difference of up to 60 metres exists between the inner city districts on the Aare (Matte, Marzili) and the higher ones (Kirchenfeld, L\u00e4nggasse).\nBern has an area, as of 2013[ [update]], of . Of this area, or 18.2% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 33.3% is forested.

Arms control is typically exercised through the use of diplomacy which seeks to impose such limitations upon consenting participants through international treaties and agreements, although it may also comprise efforts by a nation or group of nations to enforce limitations upon a non-consenting country.\nEnactment.\nArms control treaties and agreements are often seen as a way to avoid costly arms races which could prove counter-productive to national aims and future peace. Some are used as ways to stop the spread of certain military technologies (such as nuclear weaponry or missile technology) in return for assurances to potential developers that they will not be victims of those technologies. Additionally, some arms control agreements are entered to limit the damage done by warfare, especially to civilians and the environment, which is seen as bad for all participants regardless of who wins a war.\nWhile arms control treaties are seen by many peace proponents as a key tool against war, by the participants, they are often seen simply as ways to limit the high costs of the development and building of weapons, and even reduce the costs associated with war itself. Arms control can even be a way of maintaining the viability of military action by limiting those weapons that would make war so costly and destructive as to make it no longer a viable tool for national policy.\nEnforcement.\nEnforcement of arms control agreements has proven difficult over time. Most agreements rely on the continued desire of the participants to abide by the terms to remain effective. Usually, when a nation no longer desires to abide by the terms, they usually will seek to either covertly circumvent the terms or to end their participation in the treaty. This was seen with the Washington Naval Treaty (and the subsequent London Naval Treaty), where most participants sought to work around the limitations, some more legitimately than others. The United States developed better technology to get better performance from their ships while still working within the weight limits, the United Kingdom exploited a loop-hole in the terms, the Italians misrepresented the weight of their vessels, and when up against the limits, Japan left the treaty. The nations which violated the terms of the treaty did not suffer great consequences for their actions. Within little more than a decade, the treaty was abandoned. The Geneva Protocol has lasted longer and been more successful at being respected, but still nations have violated it at will when they have felt the need. Enforcement has been haphazard, with measures more a matter of politics than adherence to the terms. This meant sanctions and other measures tended to be advocated against violators primarily by their natural political enemies, while violations have been ignored or given only token measures by their political allies.\nMore recent arms control treaties have included more stringent terms on enforcement of violations as well as verification. This last has been a major obstacle to effective enforcement, as violators often attempt to covertly circumvent the terms of the agreements. Verification is the process of determining whether or not a nation is complying with the terms of an agreement, and involves a combination of release of such information by participants as well as some way to allow participants to examine each other to verify that information. This often involves as much negotiation as the limits themselves, and in some cases questions of verification have led to the breakdown of treaty negotiations (for example, verification was cited as a major concern by opponents of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, ultimately not ratified by the United States).\nStates may remain in a treaty while seeking to break the limits of that treaty as opposed to withdrawing from it. This is for two major reasons. To openly defy an agreement, even if one withdraws from it, often is seen in a bad light politically and can carry diplomatic repercussions. Additionally, if one remains in an agreement, competitors who are also participatory may be held to the limitations of the terms, while withdrawal releases your opponents to make the same developments you are making, limiting the advantage of that development.\nTheory of arms control.\nScholars and practitioners such as John D. Steinbruner, Thomas Schelling, Morton Halperin, Jonathan Dean or Stuart Croft worked extensively on the theoretical backing of arms control. Arms control is meant to break the security dilemma. It aims at mutual security between partners and overall stability (be it in a crisis situation, a grand strategy, or stability to put an end to an arms race). Other than stability, arms control comes with cost reduction and damage limitation. It is different from disarmament since the maintenance of stability might allow for mutually controlled armament and does not take a peace-without-weapons-stance. Nevertheless, arms control is a defensive strategy in principle, since transparency, equality, and stability do not fit into an offensive strategy.\nAccording to a 2020 study in the \"American Political Science Review\", arms control is rare because successful arms control agreements involve a difficult trade-off between transparency and security. For arms control agreements to be effective, there needs to be a way to thoroughly verify that a state is following the agreement, such as through intrusive inspections. However, states are often reluctant to submit to such inspections when they have reasons to fear that the inspectors will use the inspections to gather information about the capabilities of the state, which could be used in a future conflict.\nHistory.\nPre-19th century.\nOne of the first recorded attempts in arms control was a set of rules laid down in ancient Greece by the Amphictyonic Leagues. Rulings specified how war could be waged, and breaches of this could be punished by fines or by war.\nIn the 8th and 9th centuries AD, swords and chain mail armor manufactured in the Frankish empire were highly sought after for their quality, and Charlemagne (r. 768\u2013814), made their sale or export to foreigners illegal, punishable by forfeiture of property or even death. This was an attempt to limit the possession and use of this equipment by the Franks' enemies, including the Moors, the Vikings and the Slavs.\nThe church used its position as a trans-national organization to limit the means of warfare. The 989 Peace of God (extended in 1033) ruling protected noncombatants, agrarian and economic facilities, and the property of the church from war. The 1027 Truce of God also tried to prevent violence between Christians. The Second Lateran Council in 1139 prohibited the use of crossbows against other Christians, although it did not prevent its use against non-Christians.\nThe development of firearms led to an increase in the devastation of war. The brutality of wars during this period led to efforts to formalize the rules of war, with humane treatment for prisoners of war or wounded, as well as rules to protect non-combatants and the pillaging of their property. However, during the period until the beginning of the 19th century few formal arms control agreements were recorded, except theoretical proposals and those imposed on defeated armies.\nOne treaty which was concluded was the Strasbourg Agreement of 1675. This is the first international agreement limiting the use of chemical weapons, in this case, poison bullets. The treaty was signed between France and The Holy Roman Empire\n19th century.\nThe 1817 Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom was the first arms control treaty of what can be considered the modern industrial era, leading to the demilitarization of the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain region of North America. This was followed by the 1871 Treaty of Washington which led to total demilitarization.\nThe industrial revolution led to the increasing mechanization of warfare, as well as rapid advances in the development of firearms; the increased potential of devastation (which was later seen in the battlefields of World War I) led to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia calling together the leaders of 26 nations for the First Hague Conference in 1899. The Conference led to the signing of the Hague Convention of 1899 that led to rules of declaring and conducting warfare as well as the use of modern weaponry, and also led to the setting up of the Permanent Court of Arbitration.\n1900 to 1945.\nA Second Hague Conference was called in 1907 leading to additions and amendments to the original 1899 agreement. A Third Hague Conference was called for 1915, but this was abandoned due to the First World War.\nAfter the World War I, the League of Nations was set up which attempted to limit and reduce arms. However the enforcement of this policy was not effective. Various naval conferences, such as the Washington Naval Conference, were held during the period between the First and Second World Wars to limit the number and size of major warships of the five great naval powers.\nThe 1925 Geneva Conference led to the banning of chemical weapons being deployed against enemy nationals in international armed conflict as part of the Geneva Protocol. The 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, whilst ineffective, attempted for \"providing for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy\".\nSince 1945.\nAfter World War II, the United Nations was set up as a body to promote and to maintain international peace and security. The United States proposed the Baruch Plan in 1946 as a way to impose stringent international control over the nuclear fuel cycle and thereby avert a global nuclear arms race, but the Soviet Union rejected the proposal and negotiations failed. Following President Eisenhower's 1953 Atoms for Peace speech to the UN General Assembly, the International Atomic Energy Agency was set up in 1957 to promote peaceful uses of nuclear technology and apply safeguards against the diversion of nuclear material from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons.\nUnder the auspices of the United Nations, the Partial Test Ban Treaty, which aimed to end nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere, underwater and in outer-space, was established in 1963. The 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was signed to prevent further spread of nuclear weapons technology to countries outside the five that already possessed them: the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France and China. With the three main goals of establishing nonproliferation with inspections, nuclear arms reduction, and the right to use nuclear energy peacefully, this treaty initially met some reluctance from countries developing their own nuclear programs such as Brazil, Argentina and South Africa. Still, all countries with the exception of India, Israel, Pakistan and South Sudan decided to sign or ratify the document.\nThe Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) between the United States and Soviet Union in the late 1960s/early 1970s led to further weapons control agreements. The SALT I talks led to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and an \"Interim Strategic Arms Limitation Agreement\" (see SALT I), both in 1972. The SALT II talks started in 1972 leading to agreement in 1979. Due to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan the United States never ratified the treaty, but the agreement was honoured by both sides.\nThe Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was signed between the United States and Soviet Union in 1987 and ratified in 1988, leading to an agreement to destroy all missiles with ranges from 500 to 5,500 kilometers. This came in the context of a revitalised peace movement during the previous decade which included huge demonstrations around the world for nuclear disarmament.\nThe 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention was signed banning the manufacture and use of chemical weapons.\nThe Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties were signed, as START I and START II, by the US and Soviet Union, further restricting weapons. This was further moved on by the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions, which was in turn superseded by the New START Treaty.\nThe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was signed in 1996 banning all nuclear explosions in all environments, for military or civilian purposes, but it has not entered into force due to the non-ratification of eight specific states.\nIn 1998 the United Nations founded the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA). Its goal is to promote nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and the strengthening of the disarmament regimes in respect to other weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological weapons. It also promotes disarmament efforts in the area of conventional weapons, especially landmines and small arms, which are often the weapons of choice in contemporary conflicts.\nIn addition to treaties focused primarily on stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons, there has been a recent movement to regulate the sale and trading of conventional weapons. As of December 2014, the United Nations is preparing for entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty, which has been ratified by 89 nations. However, it is currently missing ratification by key arms producers such as Russia and China, and while the United States has signed the treaty it has not yet ratified it. The Treaty regulates the international trade in almost all categories of conventional weapons \u2013 from small arms to battle tanks, combat aircraft and warships. Ammunition, as well as parts and components, are also covered.\nMore recently, the United Nations announced the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in 2020, following the 50th ratification or accession by member states.\nList of treaties and conventions related to arms control.\nSome of the more important international arms control agreements follow:\nNuclear weapon-free zone treaties.\nOther treaties also envision the creation of NWFZ, among other objectives. These are the following:\nArms control organizations.\n intergovernmental organizations for arms control include:\nThere are also numerous non-governmental organizations that promote a global arms reduction and offer research and analysis about (US) nuclear weapons policy.

It is a memoir in two parts on the theme of poverty in the two cities. Its target audience was the middle- and upper-class members of society\u2014those who were more likely to be well educated\u2014and it exposes the poverty existing in two prosperous cities: Paris and London. The first part is an account of living in near-extreme poverty and destitution in Paris and the experience of casual labour in restaurant kitchens. The second part is a travelogue of life on the road in and around London from the tramp's perspective, with descriptions of the types of hostel accommodation available and some of the characters to be found living on the margins.\nBackground.\nAfter giving up his post as a policeman in Burma to become a writer, Orwell moved to rooms in Portobello Road, London at the end of 1927 when he was 24. While contributing to various journals, he undertook investigative tramping expeditions in and around London, collecting material for use in \"The Spike\", his first published essay, and for the latter half of \"Down and Out in Paris and London\". In spring of 1928 he moved to Paris and lived at 6 Rue du Pot de Fer in the Latin Quarter, a bohemian quarter with a cosmopolitan flavour. American writers like Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald had lived in the same area. Following the Russian Revolution, there was a large Russian emigre community in Paris. Orwell's aunt Nellie Limouzin also lived in Paris and gave him social and, when necessary, financial support. He led an active social life, worked on his novels and had several articles published in avant-garde journals.\nOrwell fell seriously ill in March 1929 and shortly afterwards had money stolen from the lodging house. The thief was probably not the young Italian described in \"Down and Out\". In a later account, he said the theft was the work of a young woman whom he had picked up and brought back with him; it has been submitted that \"consideration for his parents' sensibilities would have required the suppression of this misadventure\". Whoever reduced Orwell to destitution did him a good turn; his final ten weeks in Paris sowed the seed of his first published book. Whether through necessity or just to collect material, and probably both, he undertook casual work as a dishwasher in restaurants. In August 1929 he sent a copy of \"The Spike\" to the \"Adelphi\" magazine in London, and it was accepted for publication. Orwell left Paris in December 1929 and returned to England, going straight home to his parents' house in Southwold. Later he acted as a private tutor to a disabled child there and also undertook further tramping expeditions, culminating in a stint working in the Kent hop fields in August and September 1931. After this adventure, he ended up in the Tooley Street kip, which he found so unpleasant that he wrote home for money and moved to more comfortable lodgings.\nPublication.\nOrwell's first version of \"Down and Out\" was called \"A Scullion's Diary\". Completed in October 1930, it used only his Paris material. He offered it to Jonathan Cape in the summer of 1931. Cape rejected it in the autumn. A year later he offered \"a fatter typescript (the London chapters had been added)\" to Faber &amp; Faber, where T. S. Eliot, then an editorial director, also rejected it, stating, \"We did find it of very great interest, but I regret to say that it does not appear to me possible as a publishing venture.\"\nIt was in the home of Mabel Fierz that Orwell then discarded the typescript. She had, with her husband, a London businessman named Francis, been for a number of years a visitor to Southwold in the summer and was on friendly terms with the Blairs. Fierz at this point took it to a literary agent, Leonard Moore, who \"recognised it as a 'natural' for the new house of Gollancz.\" Victor Gollancz was prepared to publish the work, subject to the removal of bad language and some identifiable names, and offered an advance of \u00a340. Orwell complained that one passage that Gollancz asked be changed or cut was \"about the only good bit of writing in the book\". The title improvised by Gollancz, \"Confessions of a Down and Outer\", bothered Orwell. \"Would \"The Confessions of a Dishwasher\" do as well?\" he asked Moore. \"I would \"rather\" answer to \"dishwasher\" than \"down &amp; out\".\" In July 1932, Orwell had suggested calling the book \"The Lady Poverty\", in reference to a poem by Alice Meynell; in August 1932, he suggested \"In Praise of Poverty\". At the last minute, Gollancz shortened the title to \"Down and Out in Paris and London\". The author, after possibilities including \"X,\" \"P.S. Burton\" (an alias Orwell had used on tramping expeditions), \"Kenneth Miles\" and \"H. Lewis Allways\" had been considered, was renamed \"George Orwell.\" Orwell did not wish to publish under his own name Eric Blair, and Orwell was the name he used from then on for his main works\u2014although many periodical articles were still published under the name Eric Blair. \"Down and Out in Paris and London\" was published on 9 January 1933 and received favourable reviews from, among others, C. Day Lewis, WH Davies, Compton Mackenzie and JB Priestley. It was subsequently published by Harper &amp; Brothers in New York. Sales were low, however, until December 1940, when Penguin Books printed 55,000 copies for sale at sixpence.\nA French translation, which Orwell admired, by RN Raimbault and Gwen Gilbert, entitled \"\", was published by \u00c9ditions Gallimard, on 2 May 1935, with a preface by Panait Istrati and an introduction by Orwell.\nSummary.\nChapters 1\u201323 (Paris).\nThe scene-setting opening chapters describe the atmosphere in the Paris quarter and introduce various characters who appear later in the book. From Chapter III to Chapter X, where the narrator obtains a job at \"Hotel X,\" he describes his descent into poverty, often in tragi-comic terms. An Italian compositor forges room keys and steals his savings and his scant income vanishes when the English lessons he is giving stop. He begins at first to sell some of his clothes, and then to pawn his remaining clothes, and then searches for work with a Russian waiter named Boris\u2014work as a porter at Les Halles, work as an English teacher and restaurant work. He recounts his two-day experience without any food and tells of meeting Russian \"Communists\" who, he later concludes, on their disappearance, must be mere swindlers.\nAfter the various ordeals of unemployment and hunger the narrator obtains a job as a \"plongeur\" (dishwasher) in the \"H\u00f4tel X\" near the Place de la Concorde, and begins to work long hours there. In Chapter XIII, he describes the \"caste system\" of the hotel\u2014\"manager-cooks-waiters-plongeurs\"\u2014and, in Chapter XIV, its frantic and seemingly chaotic workings. He notes also \"the dirt in the H\u00f4tel X.,\" which became apparent \"as soon as one penetrated into the service quarters.\" He talks of his routine life among the working poor of Paris, slaving and sleeping, and then drinking on Saturday night through the early hours of Sunday morning. In Chapter XVI, he refers briefly to a murder committed \"just beneath my window [while he was sleeping ... The thing that strikes me in looking back,\" he says, \"is that I was in bed and asleep within three minutes of the murder [...] We were working people, and where was the sense of wasting sleep over a murder?\"\nMisled by Boris's optimism, the narrator is briefly penniless again after he and Boris quit their hotel jobs in the expectation of work at a new restaurant, the \"Auberge de Jehan Cottard,\" where Boris feels sure he will become a waiter again; at the Hotel X, he had been doing lower-grade work. The \"patron\" of the Auberge, \"an ex-colonel of the Russian Army,\" seems to have financial difficulties. The narrator is not paid for ten days and is compelled to spend a night on a bench\u2014\"It was very uncomfortable\u2014the arm of the seat cuts into your back\u2014and much colder than I had expected\"\u2014rather than face his landlady over the outstanding rent.\nAt the restaurant, the narrator finds himself working \"seventeen and a half hours\" a day, \"almost without a break,\" and looking back wistfully at his relatively leisured and orderly life at the Hotel X. Boris works even longer: \"eighteen hours a day, seven days a week.\" The narrator claims that \"such hours, though not usual, are nothing extraordinary in Paris.\" He adds\nby the way, that the Auberge was not the ordinary cheap eating-house frequented by students and workmen. We did not provide an adequate meal at less than twenty-five francs, and we were picturesque and artistic, which sent up our social standing. There were the indecent pictures in the bar, and the Norman decorations\u2014sham beams on the walls, electric lights done up as candlesticks, \"peasant\" pottery, even a mounting-block at the door\u2014and the \"patron\" and the head waiter were Russian officers, and many of the customers titled Russian refugees. In short, we were decidedly chic.\nHe falls into a routine again and speaks of quite literally fighting for a place on the Paris M\u00e9tro to reach the \"cold, filthy kitchen\" by seven. Despite the filth and incompetence, the restaurant turns out to be a success.\nThe narrative is interspersed with anecdotes recounted by some of the minor characters, such as Valenti, an Italian waiter at Hotel X, and Charlie, \"one of the local curiosities,\" who is \"a youth of family and education who had run away from home.\" In Chapter XXII, the narrator considers the life of a \"plongeur\":\n[A] \"plongeur\" is one of the slaves of the modern world. Not that there is any need to whine over him, for he is better off than many manual workers, but still, he is no freer than if he were bought and sold. His work is servile and without art; he is paid just enough to keep him alive; his only holiday is the sack [... He has] been trapped by a routine which makes thought impossible. If \"plongeurs\" thought at all, they would long ago have formed a labour union and gone on strike for better treatment. But they do not think, because they have no leisure for it; their life has made slaves of them.\nBecause of the stress of the long hours, he mails to a friend, \"B,\" back in London, asking if he could get him a job that allows more than five hours' sleep a night. His friend duly replies, offering a job taking care of a \"congenital imbecile,\" and sends him some money to get his possessions from the pawn. The narrator then quits his job as a \"plongeur\" and leaves for London.\nChapters 24\u201338 (London).\nThe narrator arrives in London expecting to have the job waiting for him. Unfortunately the would-be employers have gone abroad, \"patient and all.\"\nUntil his employers return, the narrator lives as a tramp, sleeping in an assortment of venues: lodging houses, tramps' hostels or \"spikes,\" and Salvation Army shelters. Because vagrants can not \"enter any one spike, or any two London spikes, more than once in a month, on pain of being confined for a week,\" he is required to keep on the move, with the result that long hours are spent tramping or waiting for hostels to open. Chapters XXV to XXXV describe his various journeys, the different forms of accommodation, a selection of the people he meets, and the tramps' reaction to Christian charity: \"Evidently the tramps were not grateful for their free tea. And yet it was excellent [...] I am sure too that it was given in a good spirit, without any intention of humiliating us; so in fairness we ought to have been grateful\u2014still, we were not.\" Characters in this section of the book include the Irish tramp called Paddy, \"a good fellow\" whose \"ignorance was limitless and appalling,\" and the pavement artist from the Embankment, Bozo, who has a good literary background and was formerly an amateur astronomer. He has a \"dreadfully deformed\" right foot and has fallen prey to a succession of similar misfortunes, in his trade and his life.\nThe final chapters provide a catalogue of various types of accommodation open to tramps, including the four penny coffin. The narrator offers some general remarks, concluding,\nAt present I do not feel that I have seen more than the fringe of poverty. Still, I can point to one or two things I have definitely learned by being hard up. I shall never again think that all tramps are drunken scoundrels, nor expect a beggar to be grateful when I give him a penny, nor be surprised if men out of work lack energy, nor subscribe to the Salvation Army, nor pawn my clothes, nor refuse a handbill, nor enjoy a meal at a smart restaurant. That is a beginning.\nFact and fiction.\nOne of the debates surrounding \"Down and Out\" is whether it was a piece of factual autobiography or part fiction. Orwell wrote in the Introduction to the 1935 French edition: \"I think I can say that I have exaggerated nothing except in so far as all writers exaggerate by selecting. I did not feel that I had to describe events in the exact order in which they happened, but everything I have described did take place at one time or another.\" In Chapter XXIV, it is \"clear that Orwell did distort facts by claiming on his return from Paris he found himself down and out in London and had not 'the slightest notion of how to get a cheap bed'. This of course heightens the tension [...] but the truth is that in Paris he had already written his first substantial essay, \"The Spike\", describing a night spent in a Notting Hill tramps' hostel. Before his departure from England he had voluntarily lived among tramps for some time.\"\nIn \"The Road to Wigan Pier\", Orwell referred to the tramping experiences described in \"Down and Out\", writing that \"nearly all the incidents described there actually happened, though they have been re-arranged.\" Some measure of the work's veracity may be gleaned from a marked-up copy, containing sixteen annotations, which Orwell gave to Brenda Salkeld. Of the descent into poverty from Chapter III, he wrote, \"Succeeding chapters are not actually autobiography but drawn from what I have seen.\" Of Chapter VII, however, he wrote, \"This all happened;\" of Hotel X, \"All as exact as I could make it;\" and, of the Russian restaurant, \"All the following is an entirely accurate description of the restaurant.\" On the personalities, Orwell's own introduction to the French edition states that the characters are individuals, but are \"intended more as representative types.\"\nThe luxury hotel in which Orwell worked in the autumn of 1929 was identified as the Crillon by Sonia Orwell, as recounted by Sam White, the London \"Evening Standard\"'s Paris correspondent in his column for 16 June 1967. The writers Stansky and Abrahams suggested, in their study of Orwell, that it was the Hotel Lotti.\nReception.\nWithin a month of publication, Humbert Possenti, \"a restaurateur and hotelier of forty years,\" had written to \"The Times\" complaining that the book was unfairly disparaging to the restaurant trade. The \"Times Literary Supplement\" had previously reviewed \"Down and Out in Paris and London\", describing it as \"a vivid picture of an apparently mad world.\" Orwell responded to the restaurateur's criticism with a letter to the same newspaper: \"I do know that in our hotel there were places which no customer could possibly have been allowed to see with any hope of retaining his custom.\" In France, political outlook very much determined the reception of \"La Vache enrag\u00e9e\". The left welcomed it as an indictment of health hazards in commercial kitchens. The right accused Orwell of Francophobia. A middle of the road paper surmised that Orwell's account was likely to \"give a retrospective retch to Americans\" who had patronized Parisian restaurants.\nIn the \"Adelphi\", C. Day Lewis wrote, \"Orwell's book is a tour of the underworld, conducted without hysteria or prejudice [...] a model of clarity and good sense.\" JB Priestley, in the \"Evening Standard\", considered it \"uncommonly good reading. An excellent book and a valuable social document. The best book of its kind I have read in a long time.\" Compton Mackenzie wrote of Orwell's \"immensely interesting book [...] a genuine human document, which at the same time is written with so much artistic force that, in spite of the squalor and degradation thus unfolded, the result is curiously beautiful with the beauty of an accomplished etching on copper. The account of a casual ward in this country horrifies like some scene of inexplicable misery in Dante.\"\nFollowing the American publication, James T. Farrell, writing in \"The New Republic\", called it \"genuine, unexaggerated and intelligent,\" while Herbert Gorman wrote for \"The New York Times Book Review\", \"He possesses a keen eye for character and a rough-and-ready 'styleless style' that plunges along and makes the reader see what the author wants him to see.\" In contrast, the reviewer for \"The New English Weekly\" wrote, \"This book [...] is forcefully written and is very readable, yet it fails to carry conviction. We wonder if the author was really down and out. Down certainly, but out?\"\nCyril Connolly later wrote, \"I don't think \"Down and Out in London and Paris\" is more than agreeable journalism; it was all better done by his friend Henry Miller. Orwell found his true form a few years later.\" Orwell agreed with this assessment. Miller's controversial novel \"Tropic of Cancer\" (1934) is based on his own experiences in Paris around the time Orwell was there.\nIn an essay for the 1971 \"The World of George Orwell\", Richard Mayne considered the book as typical of something that was true of a great deal of Orwell's later writing: his \"relish at revealing behind-the-scenes squalor. He was always taking the lid off things\u2014poverty, parlour Socialism, life in a coal mine, prep-school tyranny, the Empire, the Spanish Civil War, the Russian Revolution, the political misuse of language. He might well have echoed W. H. Auden: \"All I have is a voice/To undo the folded lie.\"\"\nThe narrator's comments on Jews in the book\u2014for example: \"The shopman was a red-haired Jew, an extraordinarily disagreeable man \u2026 it would have been a pleasure to flatten the Jew's nose if only one could have afforded it\"\u2014are cited by a journalist for \"Haaretz\" when considering what he terms \"Orwell\u2019s latent anti-Semitism\". Some suggest the work may have been Orwell's parody of his own social upbringing and social class, noticing the narrator has both racist and anti-racist outbursts. Another commentator cites the book as evidence that anti-Semitism was much more prevalent in Paris than in London.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They have been used in terrorist attacks such as those of the Unabomber. Some countries have agencies whose duties include the interdiction of letter bombs and the investigation of letter bombings. The letter bomb may have been in use for nearly as long as the common postal service has been in existence, as far back as 1764 (\"see Examples\").\nDescription.\nLetter bombs are usually designed to explode immediately on opening, with the intention of seriously injuring or killing the recipient (who may or may not be the person to whom the bomb was addressed). A related threat is mail containing unidentified powders or chemicals, as in the 2001 anthrax attacks.\nUse by suffragettes.\nOne of, if not the first, groups to consistently use letter bombs on a wide scale were the British suffragettes of the Women's Social and Political Union in the years before the First World War. The group were the original inventors of a form of letter bomb designed to maim or kill politicians or opponents. In 1913, numerous letter bombs were sent to politicians such as the Chancellor David Lloyd George and Prime Minister H.H. Asquith, but they invariably all exploded in post offices, post boxes or in mailbags while in transit across the country. Suffragettes also once attempted to assassinate a judge they considered to be anti-women's suffrage, Sir Henry Curtis-Bennett, with a letter-bomb made partly out of bullets, but the bomb was intercepted by London postal workers before it could reach him.\nPatentability.\nLetter-bombs, along with anti-personnel mines, are typical examples of subject-matter excluded from patentability under the European Patent Convention, because the publication or exploitation of such inventions are contrary to the \"ordre public\" and/or morality (https:// EPC).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was developed from and was subsequently used alongside punched cards, the difference being that the tape is continuous.\nPunched cards, and chains of punched cards, were used for control of looms in the 18th century. Use for telegraphy systems started in 1842. Punched tapes were used throughout the 19th and for much of the 20th centuries for programmable looms, teleprinter communication, for input to computers of the 1950s and 1960s, and later as a storage medium for minicomputers and CNC machine tools. During the Second World War, high-speed punched tape systems using optical readout methods were used in code breaking systems. Punched tape was used to transmit data for manufacture of read-only memory chips.\nHistory.\nPerforated paper tapes were first used by Basile Bouchon in 1725 to control looms. However, the paper tapes were expensive to create, fragile, and difficult to repair. By 1801, Joseph Marie Jacquard had developed machines to create paper tapes by tying punched cards in a sequence for Jacquard looms. The resulting paper tape, also called a \"chain of cards\", was stronger and simpler both to create and to repair. This led to the concept of communicating data not as a stream of individual cards, but as one \"continuous card\" (or tape). Paper tapes constructed from punched cards were widely used throughout the 19th century for controlling looms. Many professional embroidery operations still refer to those individuals who create the designs and machine patterns as \"punchers\" even though punched cards and paper tape were eventually phased out in the 1990s.\nIn 1842, a French patent by Claude Seytre described a piano playing device that read data from perforated paper rolls. By 1900, wide perforated music rolls for player pianos were used to distribute popular music to mass markets.\nIn 1846, Alexander Bain used punched tape to send telegrams. This technology was adopted by Charles Wheatstone in 1857 for the Wheatstone system used for the automated preparation, storage and transmission of data in telegraphy.\nIn the 1880s, Tolbert Lanston invented the Monotype typesetting system, which consisted of a keyboard and a composition caster. The tape, punched with the keyboard, was later read by the caster, which produced lead type according to the combinations of holes in up to 31 positions. The tape reader used compressed air, which passed through the holes and was directed into certain mechanisms of the caster. The system went into commercial use in 1897 and was in production well into the 1970s, undergoing several changes along the way.\nModern use.\nIn the 21st century, punched tape is obsolete except among hobbyists. In computer numerical control (CNC) machining applications, though paper tape has been superseded by digital memory, some modern systems still measure the size of stored CNC programs in feet or meters, corresponding to the equivalent length if the data were actually punched on paper tape.\nFormats.\nData was represented by the presence or absence of a hole at a particular location. Tapes originally had five rows of holes for data across the width of the tape. Later tapes had more rows. A 1944 electro-mechanical programmable calculating machine, the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator or Harvard Mark I, used paper tape with 24 rows, The IBM Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator (SSEC) used paper tape with 74 rows. Australia's 1951 electronic computer, CSIRAC, used wide paper tape with twelve rows.\nA row of smaller sprocket holes was always punched to be used to synchronize tape movement. Originally, this was done using a wheel with radial teeth called a sprocket wheel. Later, optical readers made use of the sprocket holes to generate timing pulses. The sprocket holes were slightly closer to one edge of the tape, dividing the tape into unequal widths, to make it unambiguous which way to orient the tape in the reader. The bits on the narrower width of the tape were generally the least significant bits when the code was represented as numbers in a digital system.\nMaterials.\nMany early machines used oiled paper tape, which was pre-impregnated with a light machine oil, to lubricate the reader and punch mechanisms. The oil impregnation usually made the paper somewhat translucent and slippery, and excess oil could transfer to clothing or any surfaces it contacted. Later optical tape readers often specified non-oiled opaque paper tape, which was less prone to depositing oily debris on the optical sensors and causing read errors. Another innovation was fanfold paper tape, which was easier to store compactly and less prone to tangling, as compared to rolled paper tape.\nFor heavy-duty or repetitive use, polyester Mylar tape was often used. This tough, durable plastic film was usually thinner than paper tapes, but could still be used in many devices originally designed for paper media. The plastic tape was sometimes transparent, but usually was aluminized to make it opaque enough for use in high-speed optical readers.\nDimensions.\nTape for punching was usually thick. The two most common widths were for five bit codes, and for tapes with six or more bits. Hole spacing was in both directions. Data holes were in diameter; sprocket feed holes were .\nChadless tape.\nMost tape-punching equipment used solid circular punches to create holes in the tape. This process created \"chad\", or small circular pieces of paper. Managing the disposal of chad was an annoying and complex problem, as the tiny paper pieces had a tendency to escape containment and to interfere with the other electromechanical parts of the teleprinter equipment. Chad from oiled paper tape was particularly problematic, as it tended to clump and build up, rather than flowing freely into a collection container.\nA variation on the tape punch was a device called a \"Chadless Printing Reperforator\". This machine would punch a received teleprinter signal into tape and print the message on it at the same time, using a printing mechanism similar to that of an ordinary page printer. The tape punch, rather than punching out the usual round holes, would instead punch little U-shaped cuts in the paper, so that no chad would be produced; the \"hole\" was still filled with a little paper trap-door. By not fully punching out the hole, the printing on the paper remained intact and legible. This enabled operators to read the tape without having to decipher the holes, which would facilitate relaying the message on to another station in the network. Also, there was no \"chad box\" to empty from time to time.\nA disadvantage to this technology was that, once punched, chadless tape did not roll up well for storage, because the protruding flaps of paper would catch on the next layer of tape so it could not be coiled up tightly. Another disadvantage that emerged in time, was that there was no reliable way to read chadless tape in later high-speed readers which used optical sensing. However, the mechanical tape readers used in most standard-speed equipment had no problem with chadless tape, because they sensed the holes by means of blunt spring-loaded mechanical sensing pins, which easily pushed the paper flaps out of the way.\nEncoding.\nText was encoded in several ways. The earliest standard character encoding was Baudot, which dates back to the 19th century and had five holes. The Baudot code was superseded by modified five-hole codes such as the Murray code (which added carriage return and line feed) which was developed into the Western Union code which was further developed into the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA 2), and a variant called the American Teletypewriter code (USTTY). Other standards, such as Teletypesetter (TTS), FIELDATA and Flexowriter, had six holes. In the early 1960s, the American Standards Association led a project to develop a universal code for data processing, which became the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). This seven-level code was adopted by some teleprinter users, including AT&amp;T (Teletype). Others, such as Telex, stayed with the earlier codes.\nApplications.\nCommunications.\nPunched tape was used as a way of storing messages for teletypewriters. Operators typed in the message to the paper tape, and then sent the message at the maximum line speed from the tape. This permitted the operator to prepare the message \"off-line\" at the operator's best typing speed, and permitted the operator to correct any error prior to transmission. An experienced operator could prepare a message at 135 words per minute (WPM) or more for short periods.\nThe line typically operated at 75\u00a0WPM, but it operated continuously. By preparing the tape \"off-line\" and then sending the message with a tape reader, the line could operate continuously rather than depending on continuous \"on-line\" typing by a single operator. Typically, a single 75\u00a0WPM line supported three or more teletype operators working offline. Tapes punched at the receiving end could be used to relay messages to another station. Large store and forward networks were developed using these techniques.\nPaper tape could be read into computers at up to 1,000 characters per second. In 1963, a Danish company called Regnecentralen introduced a paper tape reader called RC\u00a02000 that could read 2,000 characters per second; later they increased the speed further, up to 2,500\u00a0cps. As early as World War II, the Heath Robinson tape reader, used by Allied codebreakers, was capable of 2,000\u00a0cps while Colossus could run at 5,000\u00a0cps using an optical tape reader designed by Arnold Lynch.\nMinicomputers.\nWhen the first minicomputers were being released, most manufacturers turned to the existing mass-produced ASCII teleprinters (primarily the Teletype Model 33, capable of ten ASCII characters per second throughput) as a low-cost solution for keyboard input and printer output. The commonly specified Model 33 ASR included a paper tape punch/reader, where ASR stands for \"Automatic Send/Receive\" as opposed to the punchless/readerless KSR \u2013 Keyboard Send/Receive and RO \u2013 Receive Only models. As a side effect, punched tape became a popular medium for low-cost minicomputer data and program storage, and it was common to find a selection of tapes containing useful programs in most minicomputer installations. Faster optical readers were also common.\nBinary data transfer to or from these minicomputers was often accomplished using a doubly encoded technique to compensate for the relatively high error rate of punches and readers. The low-level encoding was typically ASCII, further encoded and framed in various schemes such as Intel Hex, in which a binary value of \"01011010\" would represent the ASCII character \"Z\". Framing, addressing and checksum (primarily in ASCII hex characters) information helped with error detection. Efficiencies of such an encoding scheme are on the order of 35\u201340% (e.g., 36% from 44 8-bit ASCII characters being needed to represent sixteen bytes of binary data per frame).\nComputer-aided manufacturing.\nIn the 1970s, computer-aided manufacturing equipment often used paper tape. A paper tape reader was smaller and less expensive than Hollerith card or magnetic tape readers, and the medium was reasonably reliable in a manufacturing environment. Paper tape was an important storage medium for computer-controlled wire-wrap machines, for example.\nPremium black waxed and lubricated long-fiber papers, and Mylar film tape were developed so that heavily used production tapes would last longer.\nData transfer for ROM and EPROM programming.\nIn the 1970s through the early 1980s, paper tape was commonly used to transfer binary data for incorporation in either mask-programmable read-only memory (ROM) chips or their erasable counterparts EPROMs. A significant variety of encoding formats were developed for use in computer and ROM/EPROM data transfer. Encoding formats commonly used were primarily driven by those formats that EPROM programming devices supported and included various ASCII hex variants as well as a number of proprietary formats.\nA much more primitive as well as a much longer high-level encoding scheme was also used, BNPF (Begin-Negative-Positive-Finish), also written as BPNF (Begin-Positive-Negative-Finish). In BNPF encoding, a single byte (8 bits) would be represented by a highly redundant character framing sequence starting with a single uppercase ASCII \"B\", eight ASCII characters where a \"0\" would be represented by a \"N\" and a \"1\" would be represented by a \"P\", followed by an ending ASCII \"F\". These ten-character ASCII sequences were separated by one or more whitespace characters, therefore using at least eleven ASCII characters for each byte stored (9% efficiency). The ASCII \"N\" and \"P\" characters differed in four bit positions, providing excellent protection from single punch errors. Alternative schemes named BHLF (Begin-High-Low-Finish) and B10F (Begin-One-Zero-Finish) were also available where either \"L\" and \"H\" or \"0\" and \"1\" were also available to represent data bits, but in both of these encoding schemes, the two data-bearing ASCII characters differ in only one bit position, providing very poor single punch error detection.\nCash registers.\nNCR of Dayton, Ohio, made cash registers around 1970 that would punch paper tape. Sweda made similar cash registers around the same time. The tape could then be read into a computer and not only could sales information be summarized, billings could be done on charge transactions. The tape was also used for inventory tracking, recording department and class numbers of items sold.\nNewspaper industry.\nPunched paper tape was used by the newspaper industry until the mid-1970s or later. Newspapers were typically set in hot lead by devices like Linotype machines. With the wire services coming into a device that would punch paper tape, rather than the Linotype operator having to retype all the incoming stories, the paper tape could be put into a paper tape reader on the Linotype and it would create the lead slugs without the operator re-typing the stories. This also allowed newspapers to use devices, such as the Friden Flexowriter, to convert typing to lead type via tape. Even after the demise of Linotype and hot lead typesetting, many early phototypesetter devices utilized paper tape readers.\nIf an error was found at one position on the six-level tape, that character could be turned into a null character to be skipped by punching out the remaining non-punched positions with what was known as a \u201cchicken plucker\". It looked like a strawberry stem remover that, pressed with thumb and forefinger, could punch out the remaining positions, one hole at a time.\nCryptography.\nVernam ciphers were invented in 1917 to encrypt teleprinter communications using a key stored on paper tape. During the last third of the 20th century, the National Security Agency (NSA) used punched paper tape to distribute cryptographic keys. The eight-level paper tapes were distributed under strict accounting controls and read by a fill device, such as the hand held KOI-18, that was temporarily connected to each security device that needed new keys. NSA has been trying to replace this method with a more secure electronic key management system (EKMS), but as of 2016[ [update]], paper tape was apparently still being employed. The paper tape canister is a tamper-resistant container that contains features to prevent undetected alteration of the contents.\nAdvantages and limitations.\nAcid-free paper or Mylar tapes can be read many decades after manufacture, in contrast with magnetic tape that can deteriorate and become unreadable with time. The hole patterns of punched tape can be decoded by eye if necessary, and even editing of a tape is possible by manual cutting and splicing. Unlike magnetic tape, magnetic fields such as produced by electric motors cannot alter the punched data. In cryptography applications, a punched tape used to distribute a key can be rapidly and completely destroyed by burning, preventing the key from falling into the hands of an enemy.\nReliability of paper tape punching operations was a concern, so that for critical applications a new punched tape could be read after punching to verify the correct contents. Rewinding a tape required a takeup reel or other measures to avoid tearing or tangling the tape. In some uses, \"fan fold\" tape simplified handling as the tape would refold into a \"takeup tank\" ready to be re-read. The information density of punched tape was low compared with magnetic tape, making large datasets clumsy to handle in punched tape form.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was the younger of the two daughters and co-heiresses of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (the \"Kingmaker\"), and Anne de Beauchamp. Before her marriage to Richard, she had been Princess of Wales as the wife of Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, the only son and heir apparent of King Henry VI.\nAs a member of the powerful House of Neville, Anne played a critical part in the Wars of the Roses fought between the houses of York and Lancaster for the English crown. Her father betrothed her as a girl to Prince Edward, the only son of the ousted king Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou. The marriage was to seal an alliance with the Lancastrians and halt the Wars of the Roses.\nAfter the death of Prince Edward and defeat of the Lancastrians at the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471, Anne married Richard, Duke of Gloucester, younger brother of King Edward IV and of George, Duke of Clarence, the husband of Anne's elder sister Isabel. Richard was also Anne's first cousin once removed; her great-aunt, Cecily Neville, was Richard's mother. Anne became queen when Richard acceded to the throne in June 1483, following the declaration that Edward IV's children by Elizabeth Woodville were illegitimate. Anne predeceased her husband by five months, dying in March 1485. Her only child, Edward of Middleham, died in 1484 at the age of seven.\nEarly life.\nAnne Neville was born at Warwick Castle on 11 June 1456, the younger daughter of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, and Anne de Beauchamp. Her father was one of the most powerful noblemen in England and the most important supporter of the House of York. Her grandfather's sister, Cecily Neville, was the wife of Richard, Duke of York, who claimed the crown for the House of York.\nMuch of Anne Neville's childhood was spent at Middleham Castle, one of her father's properties, where she and her elder sister, Isabel, met two younger sons of the Duke of York: Richard, Duke of Gloucester (the future Richard III) and George, Duke of Clarence. Richard especially attended his knighthood training at Middleham since mid-1461 until at least the spring of 1465, or possibly since 1465 until late 1468. It is possible that even at this early stage, a match between the Earl's daughters and the young dukes was being considered. The Duke of York was killed on 30 December 1460 but, with Warwick's help, his eldest son became King Edward IV in March 1461. In July 1469, Lady Isabel married Clarence, while in July 1470, after the Earl of Warwick's flight to France and change of allegiance, Anne Neville was betrothed to Edward of Westminster, the Lancastrian heir to the throne of England, and married to him by the end of the same year.\nPrincess of Wales.\nThe Earl of Warwick had been at odds with Edward IV for some time, resenting his clandestine marriage to Elizabeth Woodville and the subsequent rise in the king's favour of the new queen's family, the Woodvilles. In 1469, the earl tried to put his son-in-law George on the throne, but met resistance from Parliament. After a second rebellion against King Edward failed in early 1470, he was forced to flee to France, where he allied himself with the ousted House of Lancaster in 1470. With King Henry VI imprisoned in the Tower of London, the \"de facto\" Lancastrian leader was his consort, Margaret of Anjou, who was suspicious of Warwick's motives. To quell these suspicions, Anne Neville was formally betrothed to the son of Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou, Edward of Westminster, at the Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise in France. They were married in Angers Cathedral, probably on 13 December 1470, to make Anne Neville the Princess of Wales.\nWarwick restored Henry VI to the throne in October 1470; Edward IV however returned to the country in March 1471 and quickly captured London and the person of Henry VI. The mentally challenged Henry VI was taken by Edward IV as a prisoner to the Battle of Barnet, where Warwick was killed on 14 April 1471. Edward IV then incarcerated Henry VI in the Tower of London. Following the decisive Yorkist victory at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May, Henry was reported to have died of \"pure displeasure and melancholy,\" although \"The Great Chronicle of London\" reported that Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was responsible for his death. As Constable of England, he probably delivered King Edward's order to kill Henry to the Constable of the Tower.\nMargaret of Anjou had returned to England with Anne Neville and Prince Edward in April, bringing additional troops. At the Battle of Tewkesbury, Edward IV crushed this last Lancastrian army. Prince Edward was killed in or shortly after the battle, and Anne Neville was taken prisoner. She was taken first to Coventry and then to the house of her brother-in-law the Duke of Clarence in London, while her mother Anne Beauchamp, Warwick's wife, sought sanctuary in Beaulieu Abbey. When the crisis settled down and the Countess wished to be restored to her estates, Edward IV refused her safe conduct to plead her case; she wrote to Queen Elizabeth and several others to no avail.\nAnne, now widowed, became the subject of some dispute between George of Clarence and his brother Richard of Gloucester, who still wanted to marry her. Anne Neville and her sister, the Duchess of Clarence, were heiresses to their parents' vast estates. Clarence, anxious to secure the entire inheritance, treated her as his ward and opposed her getting married, which would strengthen her position to claim a share.\nThere are various accounts of what happened subsequently, including the story that Clarence hid her in a London cookshop, disguised as a servant, so that his brother would not know where she was. Gloucester is said to have tracked her down and escorted her to sanctuary at the Church of St Martin's le Grand. In order to win the final consent of his brother George to the marriage, Richard of Gloucester renounced most of Warwick's land and property, including the earldoms of Warwick (which the earl had held in his wife's right) and Salisbury and surrendered to Clarence the office of Great Chamberlain of England.\nDuchess of Gloucester.\nThe exact date of the wedding of Anne Neville and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, is not known, although most sources agree that a ceremony took place sometime in the late spring/early summer of 1472 in St Stephen's Chapel in the Palace of Westminster, after a dispensation to marry was issued from Rome on 22 April 1472. This dispensed the impediment of affinity created when Anne married Edward of Lancaster, who was Richard's blood cousin. The couple made their marital home in the familiar surroundings of Middleham Castle, Yorkshire, after Richard was appointed Governor of the North on the king's behalf. Upon her marriage, Anne was styled Duchess of Gloucester. They had only one child, Edward, born at Middleham allegedly sometime in 1473, but more probably in 1476. Anne's mother, the Countess of Warwick, joined her daughter's household in 1473 after Richard obtained the king's permission to release his mother-in-law from her guarded sanctuary.\nIn 1478, Anne Neville inherited the Lordship of Glamorgan. The title had been held by her father and on his death had passed to Anne's elder sister Isabel Neville. Women could not exercise the Lordship in their own right, so the title immediately transferred to Isabel's husband, George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence. On his death in February 1478, the title passed to Anne and was henceforth exercised by her husband, Richard of Gloucester until his death, when it passed to the new king, Henry VII.\nQueen of England.\nOn 9 April 1483, Edward IV died and Anne's husband Richard was named Lord Protector for his 12-year-old nephew Edward V. But on 25 June 1483, Edward V and his siblings were declared illegitimate and Richard ascended the throne as King Richard III. Anne Neville was crowned alongside her husband on 6 July 1483 by Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, the first joint coronation in England in 175 years. The queen's train was borne by Margaret, Countess of Richmond, whose son would become Henry VII after defeating Richard at the Battle of Bosworth. Almost the entire peerage of England was present at what was a magnificent spectacle. Richard and Anne's son, Edward of Middleham, was created Prince of Wales in York Minster on 8 September 1483 following their Royal Progress across England.\nAnne was on good terms with her mother-in-law Cecily Neville, Duchess of York, with whom she discussed religious works, such as the writings of Mechtilde of Hackeborn.\nEdward of Middleham died suddenly in April 1484 at Middleham Castle, while his parents were in Nottingham on their way to visit him. Both Richard and Anne were overwhelmed with grief at this news. Anne was particularly heartbroken, and she fell gravely ill only a few months later.\nAfter the death of her son, Anne Neville effectively adopted her nephew Edward, Earl of Warwick. After Anne Neville died, Richard may have named another nephew, John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, as his heir presumptive.\nDeath.\nAnne Neville died on 16 March 1485, probably of tuberculosis, at Westminster. The day she died, there was an eclipse, which some took to be an omen of her husband's fall from heavenly grace. She was buried in Westminster Abbey in an unmarked grave to the right of the High Altar, next to the door to the Confessor's Chapel. Richard III is said to have wept at her funeral. Nevertheless, rumours circulated that Richard III had poisoned her in order to marry his niece Elizabeth of York.\nRichard sent Elizabeth away from court to Sheriff Hutton and publicly rebutted these rumours on 30 March 1485 during an assembly of Lords he had summoned at the Hospital of St. John. Addressing them \"in a loud and distinct voice\", he \"showed his grief and displeasure aforesaid and said it never came into his thought or mind to marry in such manner wise, nor willing nor glad of the death of his queen but as sorry and in heart as heavy as man might be \u2026\". There is no reason to doubt that Richard's grief over his wife's death was genuine. Documents later found in the Portuguese royal archives show that after Anne's death, Richard's ambassadors were sent on a formal errand to negotiate a double marriage between Richard and the Portuguese king's sister Joanna (who was of Lancastrian descent), and Elizabeth of York and Joanna's cousin Duke Manuel (the future Manuel I).\nThere was no memorial to Queen Anne until 1960, when a bronze tablet was erected on a wall near her grave by the Richard III Society.\nCultural depictions.\nTheatre and film.\nAnne Neville appears in three scenes in William Shakespeare's \"Richard III\". In Act I, Scene 2, Richard III persuades her to marry him. In Act IV, Scene 1, just before Richard III's coronation, Anne Neville meets Edward IV's widow and laments her own position. In Act V, Scene 3, Anne Neville is one of the ghosts that appear to Richard III.\nThe role has been played in film by\nAnne Neville is also a character in the 1939 film \"Tower of London\" (played by Rose Hobart), and its 1962 remake (1962) (played by Joan Camden).\nIn German productions of musical \"Tanz Der Vampire (Dance of the Vampires)\" at the ball of Count von Krolock there are several historical figures among vampires, including Anne Neville and her husband King Richard III.\nNovels.\nAnne Neville is a major character in several historical novels.\nShe is the title character in:\nAnne Neville is one of the main characters in:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Initially, EULAs were often printed as shrink wrap contracts, where tearing the shrink wrap indicated acceptance. Software distributed via the internet is more commonly licensed via clickwrap (where the user clicks to agree to the license) or browsewrap (continuing to browse the website indicates agreement).\nMost companies prefer to sell licenses rather than copies of the software because it enables them to enforce stricter terms on the end user in a number of domains, especially by prohibiting transfer of ownership or use on multiple computers, and by asserting ownership of the copyright of derivative works, such as user-generated content in video games.\nEnforceability of EULAs has been a controversial issue and varies by jurisdiction. In the United States, it is possible to enforce a EULA that is shown to the customer after purchase, but this is not the case in Germany. European Union law only allows for enforcement of EULAs insofar as they do not breach reasonable customer expectations.\nSoftware copyright.\nThe source code (or compiled binaries in the form of object code) of a computer program is protected by copyright law that vests the owner with the exclusive right to copy the code. The underlying ideas or algorithms are not protected by copyright law, but are often treated as a trade secret and concealed by such methods as non-disclosure agreements. Software copyright has been recognized since the mid-1970s and is vested in the company that makes the software, not the employees or contractors who wrote it.\nThe tendency to license proprietary software\u2014to sell the right of use of the software rather than a copy of the software\u2014dates from the time period before the existence, then the scope of software copyright protection was clear. These licenses have continued in use after software copyright was recognized in the courts, and are considered to grant the company extra protection compared to copyright law. Virtually all proprietary software is not sold as a copy but rather as a license with associated EULA.\nDelivery of EULAs.\nInitially, end-user license agreement (EULAs) were printed on either the shrinkwrap packaging encasing the product (shrink wrap contract) or a piece of paper. The license often stipulated that a customer agreed if they did not return the product within a specified interval. After the advent of the internet, EULAs are more often found in clickwrap format where the user only needs to click an agree button. Without the constraints of having to print the license, the length of the agreements ballooned. Another type of license, browserwrap, intuits the user's consent after they simply visit a website and are made aware of the terms of use.\nEULAs are often written in vague language, and do not inform the customer of the limitations on the agreement's enforceability. Most EULAs have been designed so that it is very difficult to read and understand them, but easy to agree to the licensing terms without reading them. Regardless of how easy it is to access, very few consumers read any part of the license agreement. Most assume the terms are unobjectionable or barely notice agreeing while installing the software. Companies take advantage of consumers' inattention to insert provisions into EULAs. Many assert that the purchaser is an adult and takes responsibility for minors' use of the product, to relieve the vendor of the issue of contracting with a minor and liability from minors' use of the product.\nEULAs, almost always offered on a take-it-or-leave-it basis as a non-negotiable condition for using the software, are very far from the prototypical contract where both parties fully understand the terms and agree of their own free will. Proponents argue that the contracts streamline purchases and that savings for the company could be passed to the consumer. Enterprises buying software for a large number of employees often negotiate the licensing agreement with the vendor.\nCommon provisions.\nAccording to one study, economic competition from different software services leads to EULAs more favorable to the customer.\nResale.\nAccording to United States federal law, a company can restrict the parties to which it sells but it cannot prevent a buyer from reselling the product. Software licensing agreements usually prohibit resale, enabling the company to maximize revenue. Proprietary software is usually offered under a restrictive license that bans copying and reuse and often limits the purchaser to using the software on one computer. Source code is rarely available. Derivative software works and reverse engineering are usually explicitly prohibited. The issue of reuse is particularly important in the copyright law of English-speaking countries.\nData collection.\nMany EULAs allow the vendor to collect information about the user and use it in unrestricted ways. \nDerivative works.\nSome EULAs restrict the ability of users to exercise copyright over derivative work made using the software, such as creative creations in the virtual worlds of video games.\nAlthough most video game EULAs assert that the developer holds the copyright on any user-generated content, this is contested by users and has not been tested in the court system. Legal scholar Anthony Michael Catton suggests that user-generated content should be considered jointly authored by the video game developers and the users.\nSome companies do allow video footage of their games to be distributed online, even for profit.\nLicense term.\nTraditionally, software was distributed in the form of binary object code that could not be understood or modified by the user, but could be downloaded and run. The user bought a perpetual license to use a particular version of the software. Software as service (SaaS) vendors\u2014who have the majority market share in application software as of 2023[ [update]]\u2014rarely offer perpetual licenses. SaaS licenses are usually temporary and charged on a pay-per-usage or subscription basis, although other revenue models such as freemium are also used. Even if the user purchases a perpetual license, it is common for EULAs to allow unilateral termination by the vendor for any number of vague reasons or none at all. Furthermore, many EULAs allow the vendor to change the terms at any time and the customer must choose between agreeing or ceasing use of the product, without getting a refund. EULAs are also applicable to in-app purchases and microtransactions. As a result, players could lose access to purchased content if the vendor decides to terminate their license and withdraw the content.\nProduct liability.\nMost EULAs disclaim any liability for harms caused by the product, and prevent the purchaser from accessing the court system to seek a remedy.\nEnforceability.\nThere has been substantial debate on to what extent EULAs can be considered binding. Many EULAs contain stipulations that are illegal and therefore unenforceable. Software vendors keep these unenforceable provisions in the agreements, perhaps because users rarely resort to the legal system to challenge them.\nEuropean Union.\nUnder the New Digital Content Directive effective since 2022 in the European Union, EULAs are only enforceable to the extent that they do not breach reasonable consumer expectations. The gap between expectations and the content of EULAs is especially wide when it comes to restrictions on copying and transferring ownership of digital content. In Germany, EULAs are only valid if known to the customer before purchase.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe United Kingdom's National Consumer Council undertook a study published in 2008 which found issues with the way 17 major IT businesses had been using EULA's and asked the Office of Fair Trading to undertake an investigation. As of 2020, the enforceability of EULAs and provisions granting copyright of all derivative works to the developer has not been judicially tested in United Kingdom.\nUnited States.\nBefore the 1996 \"ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg\" in the United States, shrinkwrap licenses were not held to be binding, but since then they often have been. In some shrinkwrap cases the customer was found not to have consented to the EULA and was therefore not bound by it. Clickwrap has been found generally to be enforceable\u2014even when the license terms are provided after the sale. The enforceability of browserwrap is lower, but has been enforced in some cases where it can be proven that the user was presented with the terms of use and continued to use the website.\nTranslations.\nEULAs are primarily legal documents with IT terminology. As such, knowledge in several different domains may be necessary to produce a satisfactory translation. \nHumor.\nThere have been numerous attempts to make fun of EULAs not being read. Some EULAs bury a contract offering payment to a reader who notices the clause. As an April Fool's Day joke, Gamestation added a clause stating that users who placed an order on April 1, 2010, agreed to irrevocably give their soul to the company, which 7,500 users agreed to. Although there was a checkbox to exempt out of the \"immortal soul\" clause, few users checked it and thus Gamestation concluded that 88% of their users did not read the agreement. During the installation of version 4 of the Advanced Query Tool the installer measured the elapsed time between the appearance and the acceptance of the end-user license agreements to calculate the average reading speed. If the agreements were accepted fast enough, a popup congratulated the users for reading several hundred words per second. \"South Park\" parodied this in the episode \"HumancentiPad\", where Kyle had neglected to read the terms of service for his last iTunes update and therefore inadvertently agreed to have Apple employees experiment upon him. Business Insider joked about EULAs that include a stipulation to not use digital audio workstation software in the development of missiles or nuclear weapons.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are usually decorated and the person who starts the book writes their name and address as the first person sending the book. People often include a list of interests as well. The FB is then passed around from penpal to penpal, and can often also become a way for one to meet new penpals. Most people hope to see the book again once it is full so they add their return address to the back cover of the book too, or inscribe \"Return to Sender\" on it. People also sometimes make FBs for someone else rather than themselves, in which case they write the name and address of the recipient on the front/at the top. Some people find friendship books fun because you can see where they have been in a trail back to the original sender/recipient.\nThe German friendship books (or ) serve a similar purpose but are kept, not sent away. Access is considered more intimate; sometimes the book even has a lock. The information given about oneself often includes quotations, poetry and worldly wisdom. Typically they are more like shared journals between two best friends or a couple and are kept at one of their houses.\nFriendship books that require entrants to make drawings, use stickers or magazine photographs are known as \"deco\" friendship books or just simply \"decos\". Typically, each entrant in the \"deco\" must use one full page to express themselves. Glitter, sequins, feathers and other scrapbooking supplies are frequently used in \"decos.\" Despite the artistic expressions used in these types of friendship books, the basic rules of passing the friendship book to person to person is the same.\nWhen a 'friendship book' is only one page (no staples), it's called a 'friendship sheet.' If the page is small, like the size of a postcard, or smaller, it's called a 'cram.' Friendship books that have a musical theme, where you have to add lyrics to your entry, are called \"lyrix\" or \"lyrics sheets\".\nSlams.\nSlams are friendship books that include a theme of questions, either \"Sign if you did/like the following\", \"What is your favorite\" or other similar questions. These usually include one page as a \"sign in\", several pages of questions, and then a \"sign out\" or \"shout out\" page at the end. \nSlams can be themed or regular. Typically they are small like a standard friendship book. Often they have a \"sign-in\" page where you put your label or name, then each page will often contain a question which you answer (i.e. When was the last time you said \"I love you\") and the signer would write the appropriate response. At the end there is often a sign-out page as well where it's dated. Slams have many variations and can be \"sign if\" slams (you sign only if the statement or question applies to you). These are handled in a number of ways, but most of them become more clear when you have it in-hand.\nCrams.\nCrams are like friendship sheets or book, but no one includes any personal information. The idea (as the name implies) is to \"cram\" as many names and addresses into the provided space.\nFriendship sheet.\nAs the name implies, friendship sheets are nearly the same as friendship books, but they are made on a single sheet of paper or stationery.\nDeco.\nDecos are similar to FBs, but are often larger in size. The cover is often decorated with interesting materials like magazine pictures, rubber stamps, decorative papers, and other embellishments. Each person who signs decorates a full page in the book. Sometimes the book has a theme, for example cats. Then, each person decorates their page following the theme. As with FBs, when these are full, they are sent home to the person for whom the book was made.\nLyrix.\nLyrix are much like decos except that each page is decorated using lyrics from a song. Some are more plain with the words simply written in them, others are as artistic as decos with pictures and other ornamental adornments.\nQuotes.\nQuotes are like Lyrics, but instead of song lyrics they contain quotes from movies. These can also be themed, such as Brad Pitt movie quotes. Quotes can be plain text or decorative.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These bonds have a higher risk of default or other adverse credit events but offer higher yields than investment-grade bonds to compensate for the increased risk.\nDefault risk.\nAs indicated by their lower credit ratings, high-yield debt entails more risk to the investor compared to investment grade bonds. Investors require a greater yield to compensate them for investing in the riskier securities.\nIn the case of high-yield bonds, the risk is largely that of default: the possibility that the issuer will be unable to make scheduled interest and principal payments in a timely manner.:208 The default rate in the high-yield sector of the U.S. bond market has averaged about 5% over the long term. During the liquidity crisis of 1989\u201390, the default rate was in the 5.6% to 7% range. During the COVID-19 pandemic, default rates rose to just under 9%.:209 A recession and accompanying weakening of business conditions tends to increase the possibility of default in the high-yield bond sector.\nInvestors.\nInstitutional investors (such as pension funds, mutual funds, banks, and insurance companies) are the largest purchasers of high-yield debt. Individual investors participate in the high-yield sector mainly through mutual funds.:211\nSome institutional investors have by-laws that prohibit investing in bonds which have ratings below a particular level. As a result, the lower-rated securities may have a different institutional investor base than investment-grade bonds.\nU.S. market and indices.\nU.S. high-yield bonds outstanding as of the first quarter of 2022 are estimated to be about $1.8 trillion, comprising about 16% of the U.S. corporate bond market, which totals $10.7 trillion. New issuances amounted to $435 billion (~$ in 2024) in 2020.\nIndices for the high-yield market include:\nSome investors, preferring to dedicate themselves to higher-rated and less-risky investments, use an index that only includes BB-rated and B-rated securities. Other investors focus on the lowest quality debt rated CCC or distressed securities, commonly defined as those yielding 1,000 basis points over equivalent government bonds.\nUsage.\nCorporate debt.\nThe original speculative grade bonds were bonds that once had been investment grade at time of issue, but where the credit rating of the issuer had slipped and the possibility of default increased significantly. These bonds are called \"fallen angels\".\nThe investment banker Michael Milken realized that fallen angels had regularly been valued less than what they were worth. His experience with speculative grade bonds started with his investment in these. In the mid-1980s, Milken and other investment bankers at Drexel Burnham Lambert created a new type of high-yield debt: bonds that were speculative grade from the start, and were used as a financing tool in leveraged buyouts (LBOs) and hostile takeovers.:208 In a LBO, an acquirer would issue speculative grade bonds to help pay for an acquisition and then use the target's cash flow to help pay the debt over time. Companies acquired in this manner were commonly saddled with very high debt loads, hampering their financial flexibility. Debt-to-equity ratios of at least 6 to 1 were common in such transactions. This led to controversy as to the economic and social consequences of transforming firms through the aggressive use of financial leverage.\nIn 2005, over 80% of the principal amount of high-yield debt issued by U.S. companies went toward corporate purposes rather than acquisitions or buyouts.\nIn emerging markets, such as China and Vietnam, bonds have become increasingly important as short term financing options, since access to traditional bank credits has always been proved to be limited, especially if borrowers are non-state corporates. The corporate bond market has been developing in line with the general trend of capital market, and equity market in particular.\nDebt repackaging and subprime crisis.\nHigh-yield bonds can also be repackaged into collateralized debt obligations (CDO), thereby raising the credit rating of the senior tranches above the rating of the original debt. The senior tranches of high-yield CDOs can thus meet the minimum credit rating requirements of pension funds and other institutional investors despite the significant risk in the original high-yield debt.\nWhen such CDOs are backed by assets of dubious value, such as subprime mortgage loans, and lose market liquidity, the bonds and their derivatives become what is referred to as \"toxic debt\". Holding such \"toxic\" assets led to the demise of several investment banks such as Lehman Brothers and other financial institutions during the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007\u201309 and led the US Treasury to seek congressional appropriations to buy those assets in September 2008 to prevent a systemic crisis of the banks.\nSuch assets represent a serious problem for purchasers because of their complexity. Having been repackaged perhaps several times, it is difficult and time-consuming for auditors and accountants to determine their true value. As the recession of 2008\u201309 hit, their value decreased further as more debtors defaulted, so they represented a rapidly depreciating asset. Even those assets that might have gone up in value in the long-term depreciated rapidly, quickly becoming \"toxic\" for the banks that held them. Toxic assets, by increasing the variance of banks' assets, can turn otherwise healthy institutions into zombies. Potentially insolvent banks made too few good loans creating a debt overhang problem. Alternatively, potentially insolvent banks with toxic assets sought out very risky speculative loans to shift risk onto their depositors and other creditors.\nOn 23 March 2009, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced a Public-Private Investment Partnership (PPIP) to buy toxic assets from banks' balance sheets. The major stock market indices in the United States rallied on the day of the announcement rising by over six percent with the shares of bank stocks leading the way. PPIP has two primary programs. The Legacy Loans Program will attempt to buy residential loans from banks' balance sheets. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will provide non-recourse loan guarantees for up to 85 percent of the purchase price of legacy loans. Private sector asset managers and the U.S. Treasury will provide the remaining assets. The second program is called the legacy securities program which will buy mortgage backed securities (RMBS) that were originally rated AAA and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS) which are rated AAA. The funds will come in many instances in equal parts from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program monies, private investors, and from loans from the Federal Reserve's Term Asset Lending Facility (TALF). The initial size of the Public Private Investment Partnership is projected to be $500 billion. \nNobel Prize\u2013winning economist Paul Krugman has been very critical of this program arguing the non-recourse loans lead to a hidden subsidy that will be split by asset managers, banks' shareholders and creditors. Banking analyst Meredith Whitney argues that banks will not sell bad assets at fair market values because they are reluctant to take asset write downs. Removing toxic assets would also reduce the volatility of banks' stock prices. Because stock is akin to a call option on a firm's assets, this lost volatility will hurt the stock price of distressed banks. Therefore, such banks will only sell toxic assets at above market prices.\nEU member state debt crisis.\nOn 27 April 2010, the Greek debt rating was decreased to \"junk\" status by Standard &amp; Poor's amidst fears of default by the Greek Government. They also cut Portugal's credit ratings by two notches to A, over concerns about its government debt and public finances on 28 April.\nOn 5 July 2011, Portugal's rating was decreased to \"junk\" status by Moody's (by four notches from Baa1 to Ba2) saying there was a growing risk the country would need a second bail-out before it was ready to borrow money from financial markets again, and private lenders might have to contribute.\nOn 13 July 2012, Moody's cut Italy's credit rating two notches, to Baa2 (leaving it just above junk). Moody's warned the country it could be cut further.\nWith the ongoing deleveraging process within the European banking system, many European CFOs are still issuing high-yield bonds. As a result, by the end of September 2012, the total amount of annual primary bond issuances stood at \u20ac. It is assumed that high-yield bonds are still attractive for companies with a stable funding base, although the ratings have declined continuously for most of those bonds.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "49786", "revid": "1871064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49786", "title": "Microclimate", "text": "Local set of atmospheric conditions that differ significantly from the surrounding area\nA microclimate (or micro-climate) is a local set of atmospheric conditions that differ from those in the surrounding areas, often slightly but sometimes substantially. The term may refer to areas as small as a few square meters or smaller (for example a garden bed, underneath a rock, or a cave) or as large as many square kilometers. Because climate is statistical, which implies spatial and temporal variation of the mean values of the describing parameters, microclimates are identified as statistically distinct conditions which occur and/or persist within a region. Microclimates can be found in most places but are most pronounced in topographically dynamic zones such as mountainous areas, islands, and coastal areas.\nMicroclimates exist, for example, near bodies of water which may cool the local atmosphere, or in heavy urban areas where brick, concrete, and asphalt absorb the sun's energy, heat up, and re-radiate that heat to the ambient air: the resulting urban heat island (UHI) is a kind of microclimate that is additionally driven by relative paucity of vegetation.\nBackground.\nThe terminology \"micro-climate\" first appeared in the 1950s in publications such as \"Climates in Miniature: A Study of Micro-Climate Environment\" (Thomas Bedford Franklin, 1955).\nExamples of microclimates.\nThe area in a developed industrial park may vary greatly from a wooded park nearby, as natural flora in parks absorb light and heat in leaves that a building roof or parking lot radiates back into the air. Advocates of solar energy argue that widespread use of solar collection can mitigate overheating of urban environments by absorbing sunlight and putting it to work instead of heating the foreign surface objects.\nA microclimate can offer an opportunity as a small growing region for crops that cannot thrive in the broader area; this concept is often used in permaculture practiced in northern temperate climates. Microclimates can be used to the advantage of gardeners who carefully choose and position their plants. Cities often raise the average temperature by zoning, and a sheltered position can reduce the severity of winter. Roof gardening, however, exposes plants to more extreme temperatures in both summer and winter.\nIn an urban area, tall buildings create their own microclimate, both by overshadowing large areas and by channeling strong winds to ground level. Wind effects around tall buildings are assessed as part of a microclimate study.\nMicroclimates can also refer to purpose-made environments, such as those in a room or other enclosure. Microclimates are commonly created and carefully maintained in museum display and storage environments. This can be done using passive methods, such as silica gel, or with active microclimate control devices.\nUsually, if the inland areas have a humid continental climate, the coastal areas stay much milder during winter months, in contrast to the hotter summers. This is the case in places such as British Columbia, where Vancouver has an oceanic wet winter with rare frosts, but inland areas that average several degrees warmer in summer have cold and snowy winters.\nSources and influences on microclimate.\nTwo main parameters to define a microclimate within a certain area are temperature and humidity. A source of a drop in temperature and/or humidity can be attributed to different sources or influences.\nOften a microclimate is shaped by a conglomerate of different influences and is a subject of microscale meteorology.\nCold air pool.\nExamples of the cold air pool (CAP) effect are Gstettneralm Sinkhole in Austria (lowest recorded temperature ) and Peter Sinks in the US.\nThe main criterion on the wind speed formula_1 in order to create a warm air flow penetration into a CAP is the following:\nformula_2\nwhere formula_3 is the Froude number, formula_4 \u2014 the Brunt\u2013V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency, formula_5 \u2014 depth of the valley, and formula_6 \u2014 Froude number at the threshold wind speed.\nCraters.\nThe presence of permafrost close to the surface in a crater creates a unique microclimate environment.\nCaves.\nCaves are important geologic formations that can house unique and delicate geologic/biological environments. The vast majority of caves found are made of calcium carbonates such as limestone. In these dissolution environments, many species of flora and fauna find home. The mixture of water content within the cave atmosphere, air pressure, geochemistry of the cave rock as well as the waste product from these species can combine to make unique microclimates within cave systems. \nThe speleogenetic effect is an observed and studied process of air circulation within cave environments brought on by convection. In phreatic conditions the cave surfaces are exposed to the enclosed air (as opposed to submerged and interacting with water from the water table in vadose conditions). This air circulates water particles that condense on cave walls and formations such as speleothems. This condensing water has been found to contribute to cave wall erosion and the formation of morphological features. Some examples of this can be found in the limestone walls of Grotta Giusti; a thermal cave near Monsummano, Lucca, Italy. Any process that leads to an increase or decrease in chemical/physical processes will subsequently impact the environment within that system. Air density within caves, which directly relates to the convection processes, is determined by the air temperature, humidity, and pressure. In enclosed cave environments, the introduction of bacteria, algae, plants, animals, or human interference can change any one of these factors therefore altering the microenvironment within the cave. There are over 750 caves worldwide that are available for people to visit. The constant human traffic through these cave environments can have a negative effect on the microclimates as well as on the geological and archeological findings. Factors that play into the deterioration of these environments include nearby deforestation, agriculture operations, water exploitation, mining, and tourist operations.\nThe speleogenetic effect of normal caves tends to show a slow circulation of air. In unique conditions where acids are present, the effects of erosion and changes to the microenvironment can be drastically enhanced. One example is the effect of the presence of hydrosulfuric acid(). When the oxidized hydrosulfuric acid chemically alters to sulfuric acid(), this acid starts to react with the calcium carbonate rock at much higher rates. The water involved in this reaction tends to have a high pH of 3 which renders the water almost unlivable for many bacteria and algae. An example of this can be found in the Grotta Grande del Vento cave in Ancona, Italy.\nPlant microclimate.\nAs pointed out by meteorologist Rudolf Geiger, not only does climate influence the living plant, but the opposite effect of the interaction of plants on their environment can also take place, which is ultimately known as \"plant climate\". This effect has important consequences for forests in the midst of a continent; indeed, if forests were not creating their own clouds and water cycle with their efficient evapotranspiration activity, there would be no forest far away from coasts, as statistically, without any other influence, rainfall occurrence would decrease from the coast towards inland. Planting trees to fight drought has also been proposed in the context of afforestation.\nDams.\nArtificial reservoirs as well as natural ones create microclimates and often influence the macroscopic climate as well.\nSlopes.\nAnother contributing factor of microclimate is the slope or aspect of an area. South-facing slopes in the Northern Hemisphere and north-facing slopes in the Southern Hemisphere are exposed to more direct sunlight than opposite slopes and are therefore warmer for longer periods of time, giving the slope a warmer microclimate than the areas around the slope. The lowest area of a glen may sometimes frost sooner or harder than a nearby spot uphill, because cold air sinks, a drying breeze may not reach the lowest bottom, and humidity lingers and precipitates, then freezes.\nSoil types.\nThe type of soil found in an area can also affect microclimates. For example, soils heavy in clay can act like pavement, moderating the near ground temperature. On the other hand, if soil has many air pockets, then the heat could be trapped underneath the topsoil, resulting in the increased possibility of frost at ground level.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Like his friend Siegfried Sassoon, he wrote of his experiences in World War I in both verse and prose. For most of his career, Blunden was also a reviewer for English publications and an academic in Tokyo and later Hong Kong. He ended his career as Professor of Poetry at the University of Oxford. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature six times.\nEarly years.\nBorn in London, Blunden was the eldest of the nine children of Charles Edmund Blunden (1871\u20131951) and his wife, Georgina Margaret \"n\u00e9e\" Tyler, who were joint-headteachers of Yalding school. Blunden was educated at Christ's Hospital and The Queen's College, Oxford.\nWorld War I.\nIn September 1915, over a year after the outbreak of World War I, Blunden was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant into the British Army's Royal Sussex Regiment. He was posted to the 11th (Service) Battalion (1st South Down), Royal Sussex Regiment, a Kitchener's Army unit that formed part of the 116th Brigade of the 39th Division in May 1916, two months after the battalion's arrival in France. He served with the battalion on the Western Front to the end of the war, taking part in the actions at Ypres and the Somme, followed in 1917 by the Battle of Passchendaele. In January 1917, and by now a temporary lieutenant (having been promoted to that rank in September 1916), he was awarded the Military Cross (MC), the citation for which reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For conspicuous gallantry in action. He displayed great courage and determination when in charge of a carrying party under heavy fire. He has previously done fine work.\nBlunden survived nearly two years in the front line without physical injury (despite being gassed in October 1917), but for the rest of his life, he bore mental scars from his experiences. With characteristic self-deprecation, he attributed his survival to his diminutive size, which made \"an inconspicuous target\". His own account of his experiences was published in 1928, as \"Undertones of War\".\nUniversity.\nBlunden left the army in 1919 and took up the scholarship at Oxford that he had won while he was still at school. On the same English literature course was Robert Graves, and the two were close friends during their time at Oxford together, but Blunden found university life unsatisfactory and left in 1920 to take up a literary career, at first acting as assistant to Middleton Murry on the \"Athenaeum\".\nWriter.\nAn early supporter was Siegfried Sassoon, who became a lifelong friend. In 1920, Blunden published a collection of poems, \"The Waggoner\", and with Alan Porter, he edited the poems of John Clare (mostly from Clare's manuscript).\nBlunden's next book of poems, \"The Shepherd\", published in 1922, won the Hawthornden Prize, but his poetry, though well reviewed, did not provide enough to live on. In 1924, he accepted the post of lecturer of English at the University of Tokyo. In December 1925, he dedicated a poem \u00ab\u00a0UP!UP!\u00a0\u00bb to the rugby men of the University and this became the anthem of the Tokyo University RFC. He returned to England in 1927, and was literary editor of the \"Nation\" for a year. In 1927, he published a short book, \"On the Poems of Henry Vaughan, Characteristics and Intimations, with his principal Latin poems carefully translated into English verse\" (London: H. Cobden-Sanderson, 1927), expanding and revising an essay that he had published, in November 1926, in the \"London Mercury\". In 1931, he returned to Oxford as a Fellow of Merton College, where he was highly regarded as a tutor. During his years in Oxford, Blunden published extensively: several collections of poetry including \"Choice or Chance\" (1934) and \"Shells by a Stream\" (1944), prose works on Charles Lamb; Edward Gibbon; Leigh Hunt; Percy Bysshe Shelley (\"\"); John Taylor; and Thomas Hardy; and a book about a game he loved, \"Cricket Country\" (1944). He returned to full-time writing in 1944, becoming assistant editor of \"The Times Literary Supplement\". In 1947, he returned to Japan as a member of the British liaison mission in Tokyo. In 1953 after three years back in England, he accepted the post of Professor of English Literature at the University of Hong Kong.\nLater life.\nBlunden retired in 1964 and settled in Suffolk. In 1966, he was nominated for the Oxford Professorship of Poetry in succession to Graves; with some misgivings, he agreed to stand and was elected by a large majority over the other candidate, Robert Lowell. However, he now found the strain of public lecturing too much for him, and after two years, he resigned.\nHe died of a heart attack at his home at Long Melford, Suffolk, in 1974, and is buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford.\nPersonal life.\nBlunden was married three times. While still in the army, he met and married Mary Daines in 1918. They had three children, the first of whom died in infancy. They divorced in 1931, and in 1933, Blunden married Sylva Norman, a young novelist and critic. That marriage, which was childless, was dissolved in 1945. The same year, he married Claire Margaret Poynting (1918\u20132000), one of his former pupils. Together, they had four daughters, who included Margaret, Lucy, and Frances. While in Japan in the summer of 1925, he met Aki Hayashi, and he began a relationship. When Blunden returned to England in 1927, Aki accompanied him and would become his secretary. The relationship later changed from a romantic one to a platonic friendship, and they remained in contact for the rest of her life.\nBlunden's love of cricket, celebrated in his book \"Cricket Country\", is described by the biographer Philip Ziegler as fanatical. Blunden and his friend Rupert Hart-Davis regularly opened the batting for a publisher's eleven in the 1930s (Blunden insisted on batting without gloves). An affectionate obituary tribute in \"The Guardian\" commented, \"He loved cricket\u2026 and played it ardently and very badly\", and in a review of \"Cricket Country\", George Orwell described him as \"the true cricketer\":\nThe test of a true cricketer is that he shall prefer village cricket to 'good' cricket [... Blunden's] friendliest memories are of the informal village game, where everyone plays in braces, where the blacksmith is liable to be called away in mid-innings on an urgent job, and sometimes, about the time when the light begins to fail, a ball driven for four kills a rabbit on the boundary.\nIn a 2009 appreciation of the book and its author, Bangalore writer Suresh Menon wrote:\nAny cricket book that talks easily of Henry James and Siegfried Sassoon and Ranji and Grace and Richard Burton (the writer, not the actor) and Coleridge is bound to have a special charm of its own. As Blunden says, \"The game which made me write at all, is not terminated at the boundary, but is reflected beyond, is echoed and varied out there among the gardens and the barns, the dells and the thickets, and belongs to some wider field.\"\nPerhaps that is what all books on cricket are trying to say.\nBlunden had a robust sense of humour. In Hong Kong, he relished linguistic misunderstandings such as those of the restaurant that offered \"fried prawn's balls\" and the schoolboy who wrote, \"In Hong Kong there is a queer at every bus-stop\".\nHis fellow poets' regard for Blunden was illustrated by the contributions to a dinner in his honour for which poems were specially written by Cecil Day-Lewis and William Plomer; T. S. Eliot and Walter de la Mare were guests; and Sassoon provided the Burgundy.\nHonours.\nBlunden's public honours included the CBE, 1951; the Queen's gold medal for Poetry, 1956; the Royal Society of Literature's Benson Medal; the Order of the Rising Sun, 3rd Class (Japan), 1963; and honorary Membership of the Japan Academy.\nOn 11 November 1985, Blunden was among 16 Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. The inscription on the stone was taken from Wilfred Owen's \"Preface\" to his poems and reads: \"My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.\"\nWorks.\nBlunden's output was prolific, and he is one of the writers most quoted in \"The Great War and Modern Memory\", Paul Fussell's classic 1975 work on the literature of World War I. \nTo those who thought that he published too much, he quoted Walter de la Mare's observation that time was the poet's best editor.\nPoetry\nBiographical books on romantic figures:\nMemoir:\n\"Artists Rifles\", an audiobook CD published in 2004, includes a reading of \"Concert Party, Busseboom\" by Blunden himself, recorded in 1964 by the British Council. Other World War I poets heard on the CD include Siegfried Sassoon, Edgell Rickword, Graves, David Jones, and Lawrence Binyon. Blunden can also be heard on \"Memorial Tablet\", an audiobook of readings by Sassoon issued in 2003.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was an early associate of the Imagist movement. His 50-year writing career produced \"143 separate titles, including poetry, literary criticism, fiction, essays, anthologies, biographies, translations, and introductions. In addition, he published reviews of over 1,350 separate books, published hundreds of other articles, and wrote an immense quantity of letters, of which approximately 8,000 have been located since his death.\" He edited \"The Egoist\", a literary journal, and wrote for \"The Times Literary Supplement\", \"Vogue\", \"The Criterion\", and \"Poetry\". His biography, \"Wellington\" (1946), won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.\nAldington was married to the poet Hilda Doolittle, known by her initials H.D., from 1913 to 1938. His acquaintances included writers T. S. Eliot, D. H. Lawrence, Ezra Pound, W. B. Yeats, Lawrence Durrell, C. P. Snow, and others. He championed H.D. as the major poetic voice of the Imagist movement and helped her work gain international notice.\nEarly life and education.\nEdward Godfree (known from an early age as \"Richard\") Aldington was born in Portsmouth, on 8 July 1892, the eldest of four children of Albert Edward Aldington (1864\u20131921) and Jessie May (1872\u20131954), n\u00e9e Godfree. His father failed to establish himself as a solicitor, going into business as a bookseller and stationer on Portsmouth High Street, later a solicitor's clerk and amateur author; his mother was a novelist (as \"Mrs A. E. Aldington\") and keeper of the Mermaid Inn at Rye. Both his parents wrote and published books, and their home held a large library of European and classical literature. In addition to reading, Aldington's interests at this time, all of which continued in later life, included butterfly collecting, hiking, and learning languages \u2013 he went on to master French, Italian, Latin, and ancient Greek. He was educated at Mr. Sweetman's Seminary for Young Gentlemen, St Margaret's Bay, near Dover. His father died of heart problems at age 56.\nAldington attended Dover College, followed by the University of London. He was unable to complete his degree because of the financial circumstances of his family caused by his father's failed speculations and ensuing debt. Supported by a small allowance from his parents, he worked as a sports journalist, started publishing poetry in British journals, and gravitated towards literary circles that included poets William Butler Yeats and Walter de la Mare.\nIn 1911, Aldington met society hostess Brigit Patmore, with whom he had a passing affair. At the time he was described as \"tall and broad-shouldered, with a fine forehead, thick longish hair of the indefinite colour blond hair turns to in adolescence, very bright blue eyes, too small a nose, and a determined mouth.\" Through her he met American poets Ezra Pound and H.D., who had previously been engaged to each other. Doolittle and Aldington grew closer and in 1913 travelled together extensively through Italy and France, just before the war. On their return to London in the summer they moved into separate flats in Churchwalk, Kensington, in West London. Doolittle lived at No. 6, Aldington at No. 8, and Pound at No. 10. In the presence of Pound and the Doolittle family, over from America for the summer, the couple married. They moved to 5 Holland Place Chambers into a flat of their own, although Pound soon moved in across the hall.\nThe poets were caught up in the literary ferment before the war, where new politics and ideas were passionately discussed and created in Soho tearooms and society salons. The couple bonded over their visions of new forms of poetry, feminism, and philosophy, emerging from the wake of staid Victorian mores. The couple were fed by a sense of peership and mutualism between them, rejecting hierarchies, beginning to view Pound as an intruder and interloper rather than a literary igniter.\nThe couple met American poet Amy Lowell and she introduced them to writer D. H. Lawrence in 1914, who would become a close friend and mentor to both.\nCareer.\nAldington's poetry was associated with the Imagist group, championing minimalist free verse with stark images, seeking to banish Victorian moralism. The group was key in the emerging Modernist movement. Ezra Pound coined the term \"imagistes\" for H.D. and Aldington (1912). Aldington's poetry forms almost one third of the Imagists' inaugural anthology \"Des Imagistes\" (1914). The movement was heavily inspired by Japanese and classical European art. Aldington shared T. E. Hulme's conviction that experimentation with traditional Japanese verse forms could provide a way forward for avant-garde literature in English.\nPound sent three of Aldington's poems to Harriet Monroe's magazine \"Poetry\" and they appeared in November 1912. She notes \"Mr Richard Aldington is a young English poet, one of the \"Imagistes\", a group of ardent Hellenists who are pursuing interesting experiments in vers libre.\"She considered the poem \"Choricos\" to be his finest work, \"one of the most beautiful death songs in the language\", \"a poem of studied and affected gravity\".\nH.D. became pregnant in August 1914, and in 1915 Aldington and H.D. relocated from their home in Holland Park near Ezra Pound to Hampstead close to D. H. Lawrence and Frieda. They felt calmer out of the bustle of the city, with more space and green. The pregnancy ended in a stillborn daughter, which traumatised the couple and put a great strain on the relationship; H.D. was 28 and Aldington 22. The outbreak of war in 1914 deeply disturbed Aldington, though no draft was in place at this time. H.D. felt more distant from the melee, not having a close affinity to the European landscape, geographical or political. This rift also put pressure on the marriage. Unhappy, Aldington dreamed of escape to America and began to have affairs. He began a relationship with Florence Fallas, who had also lost a child.\nBetween 1914 and 1916 Aldington was literary editor and a columnist at \"The Egoist\". He was assistant editor with Leonard Compton-Rickett under Dora Marsden. Aldington knew Wyndham Lewis well and reviewed his work in \"The Egoist\". He was also an associate of Ford Madox Ford's, helping him with a propaganda volume for a government commission in 1914 and taking dictation for \"The Good Soldier\".\nWorld War I and aftermath.\nAldington joined up in June 1916 and was sent for training at Wareham in Dorset. H.D. moved to be closer to her husband. He was then sent to a camp near Manchester. They found the duality of their lives harsh, and the gruelling, regimented nature of the training felt hard for the sensitive professional poet. He felt fundamentally different from the other men, more given to intellectual pursuits than unending physical labour that left him little time to write. Their sporadic meetings were emotionally wrenching and the couple could make no plans for their future together. He encouraged H.D. to return to America where she could make a safer and more stable home. They both watched news come in of heavy troop losses in France at the Somme and on other battlefields. She could not have information given on her husband's future postings overseas, all held to be secret. Rationing and the forced draft began as the war turned against the British.\nWhen Aldington was sent to the front in December 1916, the couple's relationship became epistolary. He wrote that he had managed to complete 12 poems and three essays since joining up and wanted to work on producing a new book, in order to keep his mind on literature, despite his work of digging graves. He found the soldier's life degrading, living with lice, cold, mud and little sanitation. His encounters with gas on the front would affect him for the rest of his life. He was given leave in July 1917 and the couple enjoyed a reunion during this brief reprieve. He felt distant from old Imagist friends like Pound who had not undergone the torturous life of the soldiers on the front and could not imagine the living conditions.\nIn November 1917, Aldington joined up in the 11th Leicestershires and was later commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Sussex Regiment. He finished the war as a signals officer and temporary captain, being demobilised in February 1919. He likely never fully recovered from the trauma of World War I, writing of his field experiences in the collections \"Images of War\" and \"Images of Desire\" (1919), which were suffused with a new melancholy. By the end of World War I, he was feeling disconsolate about his own talent as a poet. \"Exile and Other Poems\" (1923) also dealt with the process of trauma. A collection of war stories \"Roads to Glory\", appeared in 1930. After this point he became known as a critic and biographer.\nTowards the end of the war, H.D. lived with composer Cecil Gray, a friend of D. H. Lawrence's. They had a daughter together in March 1919, the pregnancy much complicated by H.D.'s catching pneumonia towards the end. Neither Gray nor Aldington wanted to accept paternity. By the time of Aldington's return H.D. was involved with the female writer Bryher. H.D. and Aldington formally separated and had relationships with other people, but they did not divorce until 1938. They remained friends for the rest of their lives. He destroyed all the couple's pre-1918 correspondence.\nAldington helped T. S. Eliot by persuading Harriet Shaw Weaver to appoint Eliot as Aldington's successor at \"The Egoist\" magazine. In 1919, he introduced Eliot to the editor Bruce Richmond of \"The Times Literary Supplement\". Aldington was on the editorial board of Chaman Lall's London literary quarterly \"Coterie\" (published 1919\u20131921), accompanied by Conrad Aiken, Eliot, Lewis and Aldous Huxley. Eliot had a job in the international department of Lloyds Bank and well-meaning friends wanted him full-time writing poetry. Ezra Pound, plotting a scheme to \"get Eliot out of the bank\", was supported by Lady Ottoline Morrell, Leonard Woolf and Harry Norton Aldington began publishing in journals such as the Imagist \"The Chapbook\". In reply to Eliot's \"The Waste Land\", Aldington wrote \"A Fool i' the Forest\" (1924).\nAldington suffered a breakdown in 1925. His interest in poetry waned, and he developed an animosity towards Eliot's celebrity. Aldington grew closer to Eliot but gradually became a supporter of Vivienne Eliot in the troubled marriage. Aldington satirised her husband as \"Jeremy Cibber\" in \"Stepping Heavenward\" (1931). He had a relationship with writer Valentine Dobr\u00e9e and a lengthy and passionate affair with Arabella Yorke, a lover since Mecklenburgh Square days, coming to an end when he went abroad.\nAldington helped Irene Rathbone publish her semi-autobiographical novel \"We That Were Young\" in 1932. They had an affair that ended in 1937. Rathbone dedicated her 1936 novel \"They Call it Peace\" to him, and she wrote a long poem, \"Was There a Summer?: A Narrative Poem\", in 1943 about their relationship.\nExile.\nAldington went into self-imposed exile in 1928. He lived in Paris for years, living with Brigit Patmore and fascinated by Nancy Cunard, whom he met in 1928. Following his divorce in 1938 he married Netta Patmore, n\u00e9e McCullough, previously Brigit's daughter-in-law. In 1938, Richard and Netta had a daughter Catherine; in 1950, Netta left him to raise Catherine by himself.\n\"Death of a Hero\" (1929), which Aldington called a \"jazz novel,\" was his semi-autobiographical response to the war. He started writing it almost immediately after the armistice was declared. The novel condemned Victorian materialism as a cause of the tragedy and waste of the war. Rejectionist, an \"Expressionist scream\", it was commended by Lawrence Durrell as \"the best war novel of the epoch\". It was developed mostly while Aldington was living on the island of Port-Cros in Provence, building on the manuscript from a decade before. Opening with a letter to the playwright Halcott Glover, the book takes a satirical, cynical, and critical stance on Victorian and Edwardian cant. Published in September 1929, by Christmas it had sold more than 10,000 copies in England alone, part of a wave of war remembrances from writers such as Remarque, Sassoon, and Hemingway. The book was quickly translated into German and other European languages. In Russia the book was taken to be a wholesale attack on bourgeois politics, \"the inevitable result of the life which had preceded it\", as Aldington wrote. \"The next one will be much worse\". It was praised by Gorky as revolutionary, and the book, along with Aldington's later fiction, received huge Russian distribution. Aldington was, however, fiercely non-partisan in his politics, despite his passion for iconoclasm and feminism.\nThe character of George Winterbourne is loosely based on Aldington as an artist (Winterbourne a painter rather than writer), having a mistress before and through the war, and the novel portrays locations strongly resembling those he had travelled to. One of these locations, fictionally named \"The Chateau de Fressin,\" strongly resembled a castle he wrote about in a letter to H.D.\n\"Death of a Hero\", like many other novels published around this time about the war, suffered greatly from censorship. Instead of changing or cutting parts of his novel, he replaced objectionable words with asterisks. Although they looked awkward on the page, Aldington, among others, wanted to call attention to censoring by publishers.\nIn 1930 Aldington published a translation of \"The Decameron\" and then the romance \"All Men are Enemies\" (1933). In 1942, having relocated to the United States with his new wife Netta, he began to write biographies, starting with Wellington: \"The Duke: Being an Account of the Life &amp; Achievements of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington\" (1943). It was followed by works on D. H. Lawrence: \"Portrait of a Genius, But ...\" (1950), Robert Louis Stevenson: \"Portrait of a Rebel\" (1957), and T. E. Lawrence: \"Lawrence of Arabia: A Biographical Inquiry\" (1955). Under financial pressure, he also worked as a Hollywood screenwriter.\nAldington's excoriating biography of T. E. Lawrence caused a scandal on its publication in 1955. In the spirit of iconoclasm, he was the first to bring public notice to Lawrence's illegitimacy and asserted that he was a homosexual, a liar, a charlatan, an \"impudent mythomaniac\", a \"self-important egotist\", a poor writer and even a bad motorcyclist. The biography dramatically coloured popular opinion of Lawrence. Foreign and War Office files concerning Lawrence's career were released during the 1960s and further biographies continued to analyse the 'British hero'. Robert Graves, a friend of Lawrence, wrote that \"instead of a carefully considered portrait of Lawrence, I find the self-portrait of a bitter, bedridden, leering, asthmatic, elderly hangman-of-letters.\" Robert Irwin, in the London Review of Books, speculated that Aldington's spite was driven by jealousy and a sense of exclusion by the British establishment. Lawrence had attended Oxford and his father was a baronet; Aldington had suffered in the bloodbath of Europe during the First World War while Lawrence had gained a heroic reputation in the Middle Eastern theatre and became an international celebrity and homosexual icon. Irwin observes that he \"was industrious and his portrait of Lawrence was fuelled by careful research\". Christopher Sykes, in his 1969 introduction to the Collins edition (reprinted in Pelican Biographies in 1971), stated that \"for the first time, the awkward questions were faced squarely\"; Sykes's final assessment of Aldington's book is that it \"cleared the ground of rubbish, efficiently and thoroughly\".\nIn 1947 Aldington met the Australian writer Alister Kershaw in Paris. Kershaw became Aldington's secretary and moved in with Aldington and his wife Netta at their house at Saint Clair Le Lavandou in the south of France. \nAldington lived in Sury-en-Vaux, Cher, France, from 1958. His last significant book was a biography of the Proven\u00e7al poet and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral (1956).\nDeath.\nAldington died of a heart attack in Sury-en-Vaux on 27 July 1962, shortly after being honoured in Moscow on the occasion of his 70th birthday and the translation of some of his novels into Russian. He was honored in the Soviet Union, \"even if some of the f\u00eating was probably because he had, in his writings, sometimes suggested that the England he loved could, in certain of its aspects, be less than an earthly paradise.\"\nAldington is buried in the cemetery in Sury-en-Vaux. He was survived by a daughter, Catherine, the child of his second marriage, who died in 2010.\nLegacy.\nOn 11 November 1985 Aldington was among 16 Great War poets commemorated in stone at Westminster Abbey's Poet's Corner. The inscription on the stone was taken from Wilfred Owen's \"Preface\" to his poems and reads: \"My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.\"\nStyle and bitterness.\nAlec Waugh described Aldington as having been embittered by the war, but took it that he worked off his spleen in novels like \"The Colonel's Daughter\" (1931) rather than letting it poison his life. Douglas Bush describes his work as \"a career of disillusioned bitterness.\" His novels contained thinly veiled portraits of some of his friends, including Eliot, Lawrence and Pound; the friendship not always surviving. Lyndall Gordon characterises the sketch of Eliot in Aldington's memoirs \"Life for Life's Sake\" (1941) as \"snide.\" As a young man, he was cutting about Yeats, but they remained on good terms.\nAldington's obituary in \"The Times\" of London in 1962 described him as \"[a]n angry young man of the generation before they became fashionable ... who remained something of an angry old man to the end\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
