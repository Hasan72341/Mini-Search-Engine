{"id": "47096", "revid": "7852030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47096", "title": "Friedrich Engels", "text": "German philosopher (1820\u20131895)\nFriedrich Engels ( ; ; 28 November 1820 \u2013 5 August 1895) was a German philosopher, political theorist, journalist, and revolutionary socialist. He was also a businessman and Karl Marx's lifelong friend and closest collaborator, serving as the co-founder of Marxism.\nBorn in Barmen in the Kingdom of Prussia, Engels was the son of a wealthy textile manufacturer. Despite his bourgeois background, he became a staunch critic of capitalism, influenced by his observations of industrial working conditions in Manchester, England, as published in his early work \"The Condition of the Working Class in England\" (1845). He met Marx in 1844, after which they jointly authored works including \"The Holy Family\" (1844), \"The German Ideology\" (written 1846), and \"The Communist Manifesto\" (1848), and worked as political activists in the Communist League and First International. Engels also supported Marx financially for much of his life, enabling him to continue his writing in London. After Marx's death in 1883, Engels edited from his manuscripts to complete Volumes II and III of his work \"Das Kapital\" (1885 and 1894).\nEngels' own works, including \"Anti-D\u00fchring\" (1878), \"\" (1880), \"Dialectics of Nature\" (written 1872\u20131882), \"The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State\" (1884), and \"Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy\" (1886), are foundational to Marxist theory.\nLife and work.\nEarly life.\nFriedrich Engels was born on 28 November 1820 in Barmen, J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg, Prussia (now Wuppertal, Germany), as the eldest son of Friedrich Engels Sr. (1796\u20131860) and of Elisabeth \"Elise\" Franziska Mauritia van Haar (1797\u20131873). The wealthy Engels family owned large cotton-textile mills in Barmen and Salford, England, both expanding industrial cities. Friedrich's parents were devout Calvinists and raised their children accordingly\u2014he was baptised in the Calvinist Reformed Evangelical Parish of Elberfeld.\nAt the age of 13, Engels attended secondary school (\"Gymnasium\") in the adjacent city of Elberfeld but had to leave at 17 due to pressure from his father, who wanted him to become a businessman and work as a mercantile apprentice in the family firm. After a year in Barmen, the young Engels was, in 1838, sent by his father to undertake an apprenticeship at a trading house in Bremen. His parents expected that he would follow his father into a career in the family business. Their son's revolutionary activities disappointed them. It would be some years before he joined the family firm.\nWhile at Bremen, Engels began reading the philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, whose teachings dominated German philosophy at that time. In September 1838 he published his first work, a poem entitled \"The Bedouin\", in the \"Bremisches Conversationsblatt\" No. 40. He also engaged in other literary work and began writing newspaper articles critiquing the societal ills of industrialisation. He wrote under the pseudonym \"Friedrich Oswald\" to avoid connecting his family with his provocative writings.\nIn 1841, Engels performed his military service in the Prussian Army as a member of the Household Artillery (). Assigned to Berlin, he attended university lectures at the University of Berlin and began to associate with groups of Young Hegelians. He anonymously published articles in the \"Rheinische Zeitung\", exposing the poor employment and living conditions endured by factory workers. The editor of the \"Rheinische Zeitung\" was Karl Marx, but Engels would not meet Marx until late November 1842. Engels acknowledged the influence of German philosophy on his intellectual development throughout his career. In 1840, he also wrote: \"To get the most out of life you must be active, you must live and you must have the courage to taste the thrill of being young.\"\nEngels developed atheistic beliefs and his relationship with his parents became strained.\nManchester and Salford.\nIn 1842, his parents sent the 22-year-old Engels to Salford, England, a manufacturing centre where industrialisation was on the rise. He was to work in Weaste, Salford, in the offices of Ermen and Engels's Victoria Mill, which made sewing threads. Engels's father thought that working at the Salford firm might make his son reconsider some of his radical opinions. On his way to Salford and Manchester, Engels visited the office of the \"Rheinische Zeitung\" in Cologne and met Karl Marx for the first time. Initially, they were not impressed with each other. Marx mistakenly thought that Engels was still associated with the Young Hegelians of Berlin, with whom Marx had just broken off ties.\nIn Manchester, Engels met Mary Burns, a fierce young Irish woman with radical opinions who worked in the Engels factory. They began a relationship that lasted 20 years until her death in 1863. The two never married, as both were against the institution of marriage. While Engels regarded stable monogamy as a virtue, he considered the current state and church-regulated marriage as a form of class oppression. Burns guided Engels through Manchester and Salford, showing him the worst districts for his research.\nWhile in Manchester between October and November 1843, Engels wrote his first critique of political economy, entitled \"Umrisse zu einer Kritik der National\u00f6konomie\" (Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy). Engels sent the article to Paris, where Marx and Arnold Ruge published it in the \"Deutsch\u2013Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher\" in 1844.\nEngels observed the slums of Manchester in close detail, and took notes of its horrors, such as child labour, the despoiled environment, and overworked and impoverished labourers. He sent a trilogy of articles to Marx. These were published in the \"Rheinische Zeitung\" and then in the \"Deutsch\u2013Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher\", chronicling the conditions among the working class in Manchester. He later collected these articles for his influential first book, \"The Condition of the Working Class in England\" (1845). Written between September 1844 and March 1845, the book was published in German in 1845. In the book, Engels described the \"grim future of capitalism and the industrial age\", noting the details of the squalor in which the working people lived. The book was published in English in 1887. Archival resources contemporary to Engels's stay in Manchester shed light on some of the conditions he describes, including a manuscript (MMM/10/1) held by special collections at the University of Manchester. This recounts cases seen in the Manchester Royal Infirmary, where industrial accidents dominated, and which resonate with Engels's comments on the disfigured persons seen walking around Manchester as a result of such accidents.\nEngels continued his involvement with radical journalism and politics. He frequented areas popular among members of the English labour and Chartist movements, whom he met. He also wrote for several journals, including \"The Northern Star\", Robert Owen's \"New Moral World,\" and the \"Democratic Review\" newspaper.\nParis.\nEngels returned to Germany in 1844. On the way, he stopped in Paris to meet Karl Marx, with whom he had an earlier correspondence. Marx had been living in Paris since late October 1843, after the \"Rheinische Zeitung\" was banned in March 1843 by the Prussian government. Prior to meeting Marx, Engels had become established as a fully developed materialist and scientific socialist, independent of Marx's philosophical development.\nIn Paris, Marx and Arnold Ruge were publishing the \"Deutsch\u2013Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher\", of which only one issue appeared (in 1844), and in which Engels wrote \"Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy\". Engels met Marx for a second time at the Caf\u00e9 de la R\u00e9gence on the Place du Palais, on 28 August 1844. The two quickly became close friends and remained so their entire lives. Marx had read and was impressed by Engels's articles on \"The Condition of the Working Class in England\" in which he had written that \"[a] class which bears all the disadvantages of the social order without enjoying its advantages, [...] Who can demand that such a class respect this social order?\" Marx adopted Engels's idea that the working class would lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie as society advanced toward socialism, and incorporated this as part of his own philosophy.\nEngels stayed in Paris to help Marx write \"The Holy Family\". It was an attack on the Young Hegelians and the Bauer brothers and was published in late February 1845. Engels's earliest contribution to Marx's work was writing for the \"Deutsch\u2013Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher\", edited by both Marx and Arnold Ruge, in Paris in 1844. During this time in Paris, both Marx and Engels began their association with and then joined the secret revolutionary society called the League of the Just. The League of the Just had been formed in 1837 in France to promote an egalitarian society through the overthrow of the existing governments. In 1839, the League participated in the 1839 rebellion fomented by the French utopian revolutionary socialist, Louis Auguste Blanqui; as Ruge remained a Young Hegelian in his belief, Marx and Ruge soon split and Ruge left the \"Deutsch\u2013Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher\". Following the split, Marx remained friendly enough with Ruge that he sent Ruge a warning on 15 January 1845 that the Paris police were going to execute orders against him, Marx and others at the \"Deutsch\u2013Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher\" requiring all to leave Paris within 24 hours. Marx was expelled from Paris by French authorities on 3 February 1845 and settled in Brussels with his wife and one daughter. Having left Paris on 6 September 1844, Engels returned to his home in Barmen to work on his \"The Condition of the Working Class in England\", which was published in late May 1845. Even before the publication of his book, Engels moved to Brussels in late April 1845, to collaborate with Marx on another book, \"German Ideology\". While living in Barmen, Engels began making contact with Socialists in the Rhineland to raise money for Marx's publication efforts in Brussels; these contacts became more important as both Marx and Engels began political organising for the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany.\nBrussels.\nThe nation of Belgium, founded in 1830, had one of the most liberal constitutions in Europe and functioned as a refuge for progressives from other countries. From 1845 to 1848, Engels and Marx lived in Brussels, spending much of their time organising the city's German workers. Shortly after their arrival, they contacted and joined the underground German Communist League. The Communist League was the successor organisation to the League of the Just which had been founded in 1837 but had recently disbanded. Influenced by Wilhelm Weitling, the Communist League was an international society of proletarian revolutionaries with branches in various European cities.\nThe Communist League also had contacts with the underground conspiratorial organisation of Louis Auguste Blanqui. Many of Marx's and Engels's current friends became members of the Communist League. Old friends like Georg Friedrich Herwegh, who had worked with Marx on the \"Rheinsche Zeitung\", Heinrich Heine, the famous poet, a young physician by the name of Roland Daniels, Heinrich B\u00fcrgers and August Herman Ewerbeck, all maintained their contacts with Marx and Engels in Brussels. Georg Weerth, who had become a friend of Engels in England in 1843, now settled in Brussels. Carl Wallau and Stephen Born (real name Simon Buttermilch) were both German immigrant typesetters who settled in Brussels to help Marx and Engels with their Communist League work. Marx and Engels made many new important contacts through the Communist League. One of the first was Wilhelm Wolff, who soon became one of Marx's and Engels's closest collaborators. Others were Joseph Weydemeyer and Ferdinand Freiligrath, a famous revolutionary poet. While most of the associates of Marx and Engels were German immigrants living in Brussels, some were Belgians. Phillipe Gigot, a Belgian philosopher and Victor Tedesco, a lawyer from Li\u00e8ge, both joined the Communist League. Joachim Lelewel, a prominent Polish historian and participant in the Polish uprising of 1830\u20131831, was also a frequent associate.\nThe Communist League commissioned Marx and Engels to write a pamphlet explaining the principles of communism. This became the \"Manifesto of the Communist Party\", better known as \"The Communist Manifesto\". It was first published on 21 February 1848 and ends with the lines: \"Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletariat have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Working Men of All Countries, Unite!\"\nEngels's mother wrote in a letter to him of her concerns, commenting that he had \"really gone too far\" and \"begged\" him \"to proceed no further\". She further stated:You have paid more heed to other people, to strangers, and have taken no account of your mother's pleas. God alone knows what I have felt and suffered of late. I was trembling when I picked up the newspaper and saw therein that a warrant was out for my son's arrest.\nReturn to Prussia.\nThere was a revolution in France in 1848 that soon spread to other Western European countries. These events caused Engels and Marx to return to Cologne in their homeland of Prussia. While living there, they created and served as editors for a new daily newspaper called the \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung\". Besides Marx and Engels, other frequent contributors to the \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung\" included Karl Schapper, Wilhelm Wolff, Ernst Dronke, Peter Nothjung, Heinrich B\u00fcrgers, Ferdinand Wolff and Carl Cramer. Engels's mother gave unwitting witness to the effect of the \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung\" on the revolutionary uprising in Cologne in 1848. Criticising his involvement in the uprising she states in a 5 December 1848 letter to Friedrich that \"nobody, ourselves included, doubted that the meetings at which you and your friends spoke, and also the language of \"(Neue) Rh.Z.\" were largely the cause of these disturbances.\"\nEngels's parents hoped that young Engels would \"decide to turn to activities other than those which you have been pursuing in recent years and which have caused so much distress\". At this point, his parents felt the only hope for their son was to emigrate to America and start his life over. They told him that he should do this or he would \"cease to receive money from us\"; however, the problem in the relationship between Engels and his parents was worked out without Engels having to leave England or being cut off from financial assistance from his parents. In July 1851, Engels's father arrived to visit him in Manchester, England. During the visit, his father arranged for Engels to meet Peter Ermen of the office of \"Ermen &amp; Engels\", to move to Liverpool and to take over sole management of the office in Manchester.\nIn 1849, Engels travelled to Bavaria for the Baden and Palatinate revolutionary uprising, an even more dangerous involvement. Starting with an article called \"The Magyar Struggle\", written on 8 January 1849, Engels, himself, began a series of reports on the Revolution and War for Independence of the newly founded Hungarian Republic. Engels's articles on the Hungarian Republic became a regular feature in the \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung\" under the heading \"From the Theatre of War\"; however, the newspaper was suppressed during the June 1849 Prussian coup d'\u00e9tat. After the coup, Marx lost his Prussian citizenship, was deported and fled to Paris, then London. Engels stayed in Prussia and took part in an armed uprising in South Germany as an aide-de-camp in the volunteer corps of August Willich. Engels also took two cases of rifle cartridges with him when he went to join the uprising in Elberfeld on 10 May 1849. Later when Prussian troops came to Kaiserslautern to suppress an uprising there, Engels joined a group of volunteers under the command of August Willich, who were going to fight the Prussian troops. When the uprising was crushed, Engels was one of the last members of Willich's volunteers to escape by crossing the Swiss border. Marx and others became concerned for Engels's life until they heard from him.\nEngels travelled through Switzerland as a refugee and eventually made it to safety in England. On 6 June 1849 Prussian authorities issued an arrest warrant for him which contained a physical description as \"height: 5 feet 6 inches; hair: blond; forehead: smooth; eyebrows: blond; eyes: blue; nose and mouth: well proportioned; beard: reddish; chin: oval; face: oval; complexion: healthy; figure: slender. Special characteristics: speaks very rapidly and is short-sighted\". As to his \"short-sightedness\", Engels admitted as much in a letter written to Joseph Weydemeyer on 19 June 1851 in which he says he was not worried about being selected for the Prussian military because of \"my eye trouble, as I have now found out once and for all which renders me completely unfit for active service of any sort\". Once he was safe in Switzerland, Engels began to write down all his memories of the recent military campaign against the Prussians. This writing eventually became the article published as \"The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution\".\nBack in Britain.\nTo help Marx with \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung Politisch-\u00f6konomische Revue\", the new publishing effort in London, Engels sought ways to escape the continent and travel to London. On 5 October 1849, Engels arrived in the Italian port city of Genoa. There, Engels booked passage on the English schooner, \"Cornish Diamond\" under the command of a Captain Stevens. The voyage across the western Mediterranean, around the Iberian Peninsula by sailing schooner took about five weeks. Finally, the \"Cornish Diamond\" sailed up the River Thames to London on 10 November 1849 with Engels on board.\nUpon his return to Britain, Engels re-entered the Manchester company in which his father held shares to support Marx financially as he worked on \"Das Kapital\". Unlike his first period in England (1843), Engels was now under police surveillance. He had \"official\" homes and \"unofficial homes\" all over Salford, Weaste and other inner-city Manchester districts where he lived with Mary Burns under false names to confuse the police. Little more is known, as Engels destroyed over 1,500 letters between himself and Marx after the latter's death so as to conceal the details of their secretive lifestyle.\nDespite his work at the mill, Engels found time to write a book on Martin Luther, the Protestant Reformation and the 1525 revolutionary war of the peasants, entitled \"The Peasant War in Germany\". He also wrote a number of newspaper articles including \"The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution\" which he finished in February 1850 and \"On the Slogan of the Abolition of the State and the German 'Friends of Anarchy'\" written in October 1850. In April 1851, he wrote the pamphlet \"Conditions and Prospects of a War of the Holy Alliance against France\".\nMarx and Engels denounced Louis Bonaparte when he carried out a coup against the French government and made himself president for life on 2 December 1851. Engels wrote to Marx on 3 December 1851, characterising the coup as \"comical\" and referred to it as occurring on \"the 18th Brumaire\", the date of Napoleon I's coup of 1799 according to the French Republican Calendar. Marx later incorporated this comically ironic characterisation of the coup into his essay about it. He called the essay \"The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte\" using Engels's suggested characterisation. Marx also borrowed Engels' characterisation of Hegel's notion of the World Spirit that history occurred twice, \"once as a tragedy and secondly as a farce\" in the first paragraph of his new essay.\nMeanwhile, Engels started working at the mill owned by his father in Manchester as an office clerk, the same position he held in his teens while in Germany where his father's company was based. Engels worked his way up to become a partner in the firm in 1864. Five years later, Engels retired from the business and could focus more on his studies. At this time, Marx was living in London but they were able to exchange ideas through daily correspondence. One of the ideas that Engels and Marx contemplated was the possibility and character of a potential revolution in Russia. As early as April 1853, Engels and Marx anticipated an \"aristocratic-bourgeois revolution in Russia which would begin in \"St. Petersburg with a resulting civil war in the interior\". The model for this type of aristocratic-bourgeois revolution in Russia against the autocratic Tsarist government in favour of a constitutional government had been provided by the Decembrist Revolt of 1825.\nDespite the unsuccessful revolt against the Tsarist government in favour of a constitutional government, both Engels and Marx anticipated a bourgeois revolution in Russia would occur, which would bring about a bourgeois stage in Russian development to precede a communist stage. By 1881, both Marx and Engels began to contemplate a course of development in Russia that would lead directly to the communist stage without the intervening bourgeois stage. This analysis was based on what Marx and Engels saw as the exceptional characteristics of the Russian village commune or obshchina. While doubt was cast on this theory by Georgi Plekhanov, Plekhanov's reasoning was based on the first edition of \"Das Kapital\" (1867) which predated Marx's interest in Russian peasant communes by two years. Later editions of the text demonstrate Marx's sympathy for the argument of Nikolay Chernyshevsky, that it should be possible to establish socialism in Russia without an intermediary bourgeois stage provided that the peasant communes were used as the basis for the transition.\nIn 1870, Engels moved to London where he and Marx lived until Marx's death in 1883. Engels's London home from 1870 to 1894 was at 122 Regent's Park Road. In October 1894 he moved to 41 Regent's Park Road, Primrose Hill, NW1, where he died the following year.\nMarx's first London residence was a cramped flat at 28 Dean Street, Soho. From 1856, he lived at 9 Grafton Terrace, Kentish Town, and then in a tenement at 41 Maitland Park Road in Belsize Park from 1875 until his death in March 1883.\nMary Burns died suddenly of heart disease in 1863, after which Engels became close with her younger sister Lydia (\"Lizzie\"). They lived openly as a couple in London and married on 11 September 1878, hours before Lizzie's death.\nLater years.\nLater in their lives, Marx and Engels explored the possibility that in some countries workers might be able to achieve their aims through peaceful means, but remained consistent in their view that force was necessary for the transition between systems of production, i.e. the transition from capitalism to socialism and ultimately communism. Engels also wrote in his introduction to the 1891 edition of Marx's \"The Class Struggles in France\" that \"rebellion in the old style, street fighting with barricades, which decided the issue everywhere up to 1848, was to a considerable extent obsolete\", although historians such as David W. Lowell empashised their cautionary and tactical meaning, arguing that \"Engels questions only rebellion 'in the old style', that is, insurrection: he does not renounce revolution. The reason for Engels' caution is clear: he candidly admits that ultimate victory for any insurrection is rare, simply on military and tactical grounds\".\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Marx's \"The Class Struggles in France\", Engels outlines the role that reforms have in revolutionary work by acknowledging the tactical importance of certain reforms and short-term electoral politics (particularly in regards to agitation and propaganda):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The revolutionary workers of the Latin countries had been wont to regard the suffrage as a snare, as an instrument of government trickery. It was different in Germany. The Communist Manifesto had already proclaimed the winning of universal suffrage, of democracy, as one of the first and most important tasks of the militant proletariat, and Lassalle had again taken up this point. Now that Bismarck found himself compelled to introduce this franchise as the only means of interesting the mass of the people in his plans, our workers immediately took it in earnest and sent August Bebel to the first, constituent Reichstag. And from that day on they have used the franchise in a way which has paid them a thousandfold and has served as a model to the workers of all countries. The franchise has been, in the words of the French Marxist programme, transform\u00e9 de moyen de duperie qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jusquici en instrument d'emancipation \u2014 transformed by them from a means of deception, which it was before, into an instrument of emancipation. And if universal suffrage had offered no other advantage than that it allowed us to count our numbers every three years; that by the regularly established, unexpectedly rapid rise in our vote it increased in equal measure the workers\u2019 certainty of victory and the dismay of their opponents, and so became our best means of propaganda; that it accurately informed us of our own strength and that of all opposing parties, and thereby provided us with a measure of proportion second to none for our actions, safeguarding us from untimely timidity as much as from untimely foolhardiness \u2014 if this had been the only advantage we gained from the suffrage, it would still have been much more than enough. But it did more than this by far. In election propaganda it provided us with a means, second to none, of getting in touch with the mass of the people where they still stand aloof from us; of forcing all parties to defend their views and actions against our attacks before all the people; and, further, it provided our representatives in the Reichstag with a platform from which they could speak to their opponents in parliament, and to the masses outside, with quite different authority and freedom than in the press or at meetings.\u2014\u200a\nEngels's statements in the French newspaper \"Le Figaro\", in which he wrote that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena, and asserted that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Why, we have no final goal. We are evolutionaries, we have no intention of dictating definitive laws to mankind. Prejudices instead of detailed organisation of the society of the future? You will find no trace of that amongst us. We shall be satisfied when we have placed the means of production in the hands of the community, and we fully realise that this is quite impossible with the present monarchist and federalist government.\u2014\u200a\nEngels also argued that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power that he predicted could bring \"social democracy into power as early as 1898\". Engels's stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour a revolutionary seizure at that moment in time caused confusion. Marxist revisionist Eduard Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels's stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of \"The Class Struggles in France\" had been edited by Bernstein and orthodox Marxist Karl Kautsky in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism. On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels responded to Kautsky:\nI was amazed to see today in the \"Vorw\u00e4rts\" an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs]. Which is all the more reason why I should like it to appear in its entirety in the \"Neue Zeit\" in order that this disgraceful impression may be erased. I shall leave Liebknecht in no doubt as to what I think about it and the same applies to those who, irrespective of who they may be, gave him this opportunity of perverting my views and, what's more, without so much as a word to me about it.\nAfter Marx's death, Engels devoted much of his remaining years to editing Marx's unfinished volumes of \"Das Kapital\". He is credited with preventing the work from being lost due to Marx's \"incredibly difficult handwriting\". He had to provide it with structure and develop its lines of thought, so that the second and third volumes of \"Capital\" are effectively joint in authorship and its content (except for the extensive forewords added by Engels) cannot be attributed exclusively to either author. Some scholars, notably Georges Labica, thought that Engels had altered the course of Marx's analysis, but the shift in focus from the exploitation of labourers to the accumulation of capital, and the introduction of the possibility that capitalism could survive the tendency of the rate of profit to fall is argued by van Holthoon to be already Marx's, with the latter notion present in the long unpublished \"Grundrisse\".\nWhile the task of editing \"Capital\" forced Engels to abandon his unfinished \"Dialectics of Nature\", he still completed two other works of his own in the years following Marx's death. In \"The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State\" (1884), he made an argument using anthropological evidence of the time to show that family structures changed over history and that the concept of monogamous marriage came from the necessity within class society for men to control women to ensure their own children would inherit their property. He argued a future communist society would allow people to make decisions about their relationships free of economic constraints. \"Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy\" was published in 1886. On 5 August 1895, Engels died of throat cancer in London, aged 74. Following cremation at Woking Crematorium, his ashes were scattered off Beachy Head, near Eastbourne, as he had requested. He left a considerable estate to Eduard Bernstein and Louise Freyberger (wife of ), valued for probate at \u00a325,265 0s. 11d, equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023.\nPersonality.\nEngels's interests included poetry, fox hunting and hosting regular Sunday parties for London's left-wing intelligentsia where, as one regular put it, \"no one left before two or three in the morning\". His stated personal motto was \"take it easy\" while \"jollity\" was listed as his favourite virtue.\nOf Engels's personality and appearance, Robert Heilbroner described him in \"The Worldly Philosophers\" as \"tall and rather elegant, he had the figure of a man who liked to fence and to ride to hounds and who had once swum the Weser River four times without a break\" as well as having been \"gifted with a quick wit and facile mind\" and of a gay temperament, being able to \"stutter in twenty languages\". He had a great enjoyment of wine and other \"bourgeois pleasures\". Engels favoured forming romantic relationships with women of the proletariat and found a long-term partner in a working-class woman named Mary Burns, although they never married. After her death, Engels was romantically involved with her younger sister Lydia Burns.\nEngels was a polyglot and was able to write and speak in numerous languages, including Russian, Italian, Portuguese, Irish, Spanish, Polish, French, English, German and the Milanese dialect.\nLegacy.\nIn his biography of Engels, Vladimir Lenin wrote: \"After his friend Karl Marx (who died in 1883), Engels was the finest scholar and teacher of the modern proletariat in the whole civilised world. [...] In their scientific works, Marx and Engels were the first to explain that socialism is not the invention of dreamers, but the final aim and necessary result of the development of the productive forces in modern society. All recorded history hitherto has been a history of class struggle, of the succession of the rule and victory of certain social classes over others.\" According to Paul Kellogg, there is \"some considerable controversy\" regarding \"the place of Frederick Engels in the canon of 'classical Marxism'\". While some such as Terrell Carver dispute \"Engels' claim that Marx agreed with the views put forward in Engels' major theoretical work, \"Anti-D\u00fchring\"\", others such as E. P. Thompson \"identified a tendency to make 'old Engels into a whipping boy, and to impugn him any sign that once chooses to impugn subsequent Marxisms'\".\nPaul Thomas, of the University of California, Berkeley, claims that while Engels had been the most important and dedicated facilitator and diffuser of Marx's writings, he significantly altered Marx's intents as he held, edited and released them in a finished form and commentated on them. Engels attempted to fill gaps in Marx's system and extend it to other fields. In particular, Engels is said to have stressed historical materialism, assigning it a character of scientific discovery and a doctrine, forming Marxism as such. A case in point is \"Anti-D\u00fchring\" which both supporters and detractors of socialism treated as an encompassing presentation of Marx's thought. While in his extensive correspondence with German socialists, Engels modestly presented his own secondary place in the couple's intellectual relationship and always emphasised Marx's outstanding role, Russian communists such as Lenin raised Engels up with Marx and conflated their thoughts. Soviet Marxists then developed this tendency to the state doctrine of dialectical materialism.\nSince 1931, Engels has had a Russian city named after him\u2014Engels, Saratov Oblast. It served as the capital of the Volga German Republic within Soviet Russia and as part of Saratov Oblast. A town named Marx is located northeast.\nIn July 2017, as part of the Manchester International Festival, a Soviet-era statue of Engels was installed by sculptor Phil Collins at Tony Wilson Place in Manchester. It was transported from the village of Mala Pereshchepina in Eastern Ukraine, after the statue had been deposed from its central position in the village in the wake of laws outlawing communist symbols in Ukraine introduced in 2015. In recognition of the important influence Manchester had on his work, the 3.5-metre statue now stands on Manchester's First Street. The installation of what was originally an instrument of propaganda drew criticism from Kevin Bolton in \"The Guardian\".\nThe Friedrich Engels Guards Regiment (also known as NVA Guard Regiment 1) was a special guard unit of the East German National People's Army (NVA). The guard regiment was established in 1962 from parts of the Hugo Eberlein Guards Regiment and given the title \"Friedrich Engels\" in 1970.\n In Brighton and Hove there is a Bus named after Engels, due to his love of the Eastbourne as a holiday resort and ashes being scattered in the city.\nInfluences.\nAccording to Norman Levine, in spite of his criticism of the utopian socialists, Engels's beliefs were influenced by the French socialist Charles Fourier. From Fourier, he derives four main points that characterise the social conditions of a communist state. The first point maintains that every individual would be able to fully develop their talents by eliminating the specialisation of production. Without specialisation, every individual would be permitted to exercise any vocation of their choosing for as long or as little as they would like. If talents permitted it, one could be a baker for a year and an engineer the next. The second point builds upon the first, as with the ability of workers to cycle through different jobs of their choosing, the fundamental basis of the social division of labour is destroyed and the social division of labour will disappear as a result. If anyone can be employed at any job that they wish, then there are clearly no longer any divisions or barriers to entry for labour, otherwise, such fluidity between entirely different jobs would not exist. The third point continues from the second as once the social division of labour is gone, the division of social classes based on property ownership will fade with it. If the labour division puts a man in charge of a farm, that farmer owns the productive resources of that farm. The same applies to the ownership of a factory or a bank. Without labour division, no single social class may claim exclusive rights to a particular means of production since the absence of labour division allows all to use it. Finally, the fourth point concludes that the elimination of social classes destroys the sole purpose of the state and it will cease to exist. As Engels stated in his own writing, the only purpose of the state is to abate the effects of class antagonisms. With the elimination of social classes based on property, the state becomes obsolete and a communist society, at least in the eyes of Engels, is achieved.\nMajor works.\n\"The Holy Family\" (1844).\nThis book was written by Marx and Engels in November 1844. It is a critique of the Young Hegelians and their trend of thought which was very popular in academic circles at the time. The title was suggested by the publisher and is meant as a sarcastic reference to the Bauer Brothers and their supporters.\nThe book created a controversy with much of the press and caused Bruno Bauer to attempt to refute the book in an article published in Wigand's \"Vierteljahrsschrift\" in 1845. Bauer claimed that Marx and Engels misunderstood what he was trying to say. Marx later replied to his response with his own article published in the journal \"Gesellschaftsspiegel\" in January 1846. Marx also discussed the argument in chapter 2 of \"The German Ideology\".\n\"The Condition of the Working Class in England\" (1845).\nA study of the deprived conditions of the working class in Manchester and Salford, based on Engels's personal observations. The work also contains seminal thoughts on the state of socialism and its development. Originally published in German and only translated into English in 1887, the work initially had little impact in England; however, it was very influential with historians of British industrialisation throughout the twentieth century.\n\"The Peasant War in Germany\" (1850).\nAn account of the early 16th-century uprising known as the German Peasants' War, with a comparison with the recent revolutionary uprisings of 1848\u20131849 across Europe.\n\"Herr Eugen D\u00fchring's Revolution in Science\" (1878).\nPopularly known as \"Anti-D\u00fchring\", this book is a detailed critique of the philosophical positions of Eugen D\u00fchring, a German philosopher and critic of Marxism. In the course of replying to D\u00fchring, Engels reviews recent advances in science and mathematics seeking to demonstrate the way in which the concepts of dialectics apply to natural phenomena. Many of these ideas were later developed in the unfinished work, \"Dialectics of Nature\". Three chapters of \"Anti-D\u00fchring\" were later edited and published under the separate title, \"Socialism: Utopian and Scientific\".\n\"Socialism: Utopian and Scientific\" (1880).\nIn this work, one of the best-selling socialist books of the era, Engels briefly described and analyzed the ideas of notable utopian socialists such as Charles Fourier and Robert Owen. Engels pointed out their strong points and shortcomings, and provided an explanation of the scientific socialist framework for the understanding of capitalism, and an outline of the progression of social and economic development from the perspective of historical materialism.\n\"Dialectics of Nature\" (1883).\n\"Dialectics of Nature\" (German: \"Dialektik der Natur\") is an unfinished 1883 work by Engels that applies Marxist ideas, particularly those of dialectical materialism, to science. It was first published in the Soviet Union in 1925.\n\"The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State\" (1884).\nIn this work, Engels argues that the family is an ever-changing institution that has been shaped by capitalism. It contains a historical view of the family in relation to issues of class, female subjugation and private property.\nTristram Hunt describes Engels as a pioneering feminist and as \"the intellectual architect of socialist feminism\", and according to him, \"Engels' relevance rests on... \"The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State\".\" Engels wrote that in primeval societies women were treated with a high degree of respect and took major social roles, but this changed drastically with the development of private property and monogamic family; in times contemporary to Engels, monogamic family was underpinned by capitalism, what asserted the suppression of women's rights.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nGraphic novel.\nA biographical German graphic novel called \"Engels \u2013 Unternehmer und Revolution\u00e4r\" (\"Engels \u2013 Businessman and Revolutionary\") was published in 2020.

He was the elder son of Edmund\u00a0I and his first wife \u00c6lfgifu, who died in 944. Eadwig and his brother Edgar were young children when their father was killed trying to rescue his seneschal from attack by an outlawed thief on 26 May 946. As Edmund's sons were too young to rule he was succeeded by his brother Eadred, who suffered from ill health and died unmarried in his early 30s.\nEadwig became king in 955 aged about fifteen and was no more than twenty when he died in 959. He clashed at the beginning of his reign with Dunstan, the powerful Abbot of Glastonbury and future Archbishop of Canterbury, and exiled him to Flanders. He later came to be seen as an enemy of monasteries, but most historians think that this reputation is unfair. In 956, he issued more than sixty charters transferring land, a yearly total unmatched by any other European king before the twelfth century, and this is seen by some historians as either an attempt to buy support or rewarding his favourites at the expense of the powerful old guard of the previous reign.\nIn 957, the kingdom was divided between Eadwig, who kept the territory south of the Thames, and Edgar, who became king of the land north of it. Historians disagree whether this had been planned since the beginning of his reign or was the result of a successful revolt brought about by Eadwig's enemies. The following year, Oda, Archbishop of Canterbury, separated Eadwig from his wife \u00c6lfgifu on the ground that they were too closely related. Edgar succeeded to the whole kingdom when Eadwig died in 959.\nThe Benedictine reform movement became dominant in Edgar's reign with his strong support, and monastic writers praised him and condemned Eadwig as irresponsible and incompetent. Their view was generally accepted by historians until the late twentieth century, but in the twenty-first century some historians have defended Eadwig, while others see his character and the events of his reign as unclear due to uncertain and conflicting evidence.\nBackground.\nIn the ninth century Anglo-Saxon England came under increasing attack from Viking raids, culminating in invasion by the Viking Great Heathen Army in 865. By 878, the army had overrun the kingdoms of Northumbria, East Anglia, and Mercia, and nearly conquered Wessex, but in that year the West Saxons achieved a decisive victory at the Battle of Edington under King Alfred the Great. By 883, \u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians, had accepted Alfred's overlordship, and in the 880s and 890s the Anglo-Saxons ruled Wessex and western Mercia, but the rest of England was under Viking rule. Alfred died in 899 and was succeeded by his son, Edward the Elder. In the 910s, Edward and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, Lady of the Mercians, who was his sister and \u00c6thelred's widow, conquered Viking-ruled eastern Mercia and East Anglia. \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d died in 918 and the Mercians installed her daughter \u00c6lfwynn as the second Lady of the Mercians, but Edward seized her and established full control over Mercia. When he died in 924, he controlled all of England south of the Humber.\nEdward was succeeded by his eldest son \u00c6thelstan, who may have been king only of Mercia at first, but ruled the whole of his father's realm by the next year. In 927, he conquered Northumbria and thus became the first king of all of England. He died in October 939 and was succeeded by his half-brother and Eadwig's father, Edmund, who was the first king to succeed to the throne of all England. He almost immediately lost control of the north when Anlaf Guthfrithson, the Viking king of Dublin, crossed the sea to become king of York (southern Northumbria). He then invaded Mercia and Edmund was forced to surrender north-east Mercia to him, but Guthfrithson died in 941. By 944, York was ruled by two Viking kings, Anlaf Sihtricson and Ragnall Guthfrithson, and in that year Edmund expelled them and recovered full control of England. On 26 May 946, he was stabbed to death trying to protect his seneschal from attack by a convicted outlaw at Pucklechurch in Gloucestershire, and as his sons Eadwig and Edgar were young children, their uncle Eadred became king.\nLike Edmund, Eadred inherited the kingship of the whole of England but soon lost it when York accepted a Viking leader as king. The sequence of events is unclear, but Eadred, Anlaf Sihtricson and Erik Bloodaxe ruled the kingdom of York at different periods until its magnates expelled Erik, and Northumbria became permanently part of England. Eadred then appointed Osulf, the Anglo-Saxon ruler of Bamburgh (northern Northumbria), as the earl of all Northumbria. Eadred died on 23 November 955, and Eadwig succeeded at the age of around fifteen. He was the first king since the early ninth century not to face the threat of imminent foreign invasion, although this could not have been known at the time. In his will Eadred left 1600 pounds to be used for protection of his people from famine or to buy peace from a heathen army, showing that he did not regard England as safe from attack.\nFamily and early life.\nEadwig was born around 940. He was the elder son of Edmund and his first wife \u00c6lfgifu, who died in 944. She and her mother Wynfl\u00e6d were benefactors to Shaftesbury Abbey, where \u00c6lfgifu was buried and venerated as a saint. \u00c6lfhere, the ealdorman of Mercia, was acknowledged as a relative of the royal family, and his sister married the magnate \u00c6lfric Cild, who is described in a charter of 956 as Eadwig's . This term is generally taken by historians to refer to \u00c6lfric's status as a relative of Eadwig by marriage, but he may have played a role in bringing up Eadwig. Eadwig and Edgar are not recorded in contemporary sources until 955, when they first attested charters, suggesting that they did not regularly attend court when they were young. King Eadred never married, and his attitude towards the claims of his nephews is uncertain. Eadwig attested Eadred's charters as or (Old English and Latin respectively for prince), and while some give Edgar the same title, others show him as Eadwig's brother.\nReign.\nThe evidence for Eadwig's reign is ambiguous and unclear, and historians differ widely both on his character and on the politics of his reign. The principal controversies concern his marriage and its dissolution in 958, and the division of the kingdom in 957 between Eadwig, who kept England south of the Thames, and Edgar, who became king of the land north of it.\nEadwig's marriage.\nEadwig was crowned at Kingston upon Thames, probably in late January 956. After the ceremony, a feast was held for the king and his leading magnates, including Oda, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Dunstan, the Abbot of Glastonbury and a future Archbishop of Canterbury. According to Dunstan's earliest hagiographer, who identified himself only as \"B\", a well born woman and her adult daughter, who hoped to secure a marriage with Eadwig to one of them, were pursuing Eadwig with \"indecent proposals\", and he offended the assembled nobles by leaving the feast to \"caress these whores\". Oda urged that he should be brought back to the feast, but almost all the nobles feared to offend the king, and only Dunstan and his relative Cynesige, Bishop of Lichfield, had the courage to face his ire. B went on:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As the nobles had requested, they went in and found the royal crown, brilliant with the wonderful gold and silver and variously sparkling jewels that made it up, tossed carelessly on the ground some distance from the king's head, while \"he\" was disporting himself disgracefully between the two women as though they were wallowing in some revolting pigsty. They said to the king: \"Our nobles have sent us to ask you to come with all speed to take your proper place in the hall, and not to refuse to show yourself at this happy occasion with your great men.\" Dunstan first told off the foolish women. As for the king, since he would not get up, Dunstan put out his hand and removed him from the couch where he had been fornicating with the harlots, put his diadem on him, and marched him off to the royal company, parted from his women if only by main force.\n\"B\" names one of the women as \u00c6thelgifu, the mother of Eadwig's future wife, \u00c6lfgifu, but he does not name the daughter in his account. \"B\" aimed both to show Dunstan in a favourable light and to present Eadwig as acting unregally at the coronation feast, thus demonstrating his unfitness to be king. Dunstan was exiled from England, and \"B\" said that he was driven out as a result of the machinations of \u00c6thelgifu, and that Dunstan's own pupils sided against him. Dunstan's opponents probably included \u00c6thelwold, Abbot of Abingdon and future Bishop of Winchester. \u00c6thelwold supported the marriage, describing \u00c6lfgifu in an Abingdon charter as \"the king's wife\", and she left him an estate in her will.\n\"B\"'s version is accepted by Michael Wood, who describes Eadwig as \"deeply unpleasant\", but most historians are sceptical. \u00c6lfgifu was a member of the highest West Saxon aristocracy and she appears to have been on good terms with Edgar after his accession. He described her as his relative in charters granting her property. The historian Rory Naismith sees the story of Dunstan's intervention at the coronation dinner as \"essentially a piece of propaganda designed to blacken the reputation of Eadwig, \u00c6lfgifu and her mother\". Frank Stenton comments on the story:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Even in its earliest form it has already assumed a scandalous colour which clashes with better evidence. It is known, for example, that the younger of the two ladies married the king and that she was honoured in one of the greatest of English monasteries. In the of New Minster, \u00c6lfgifu, wife of King Eadwig, appears in a list of \"illustrious women, choosing this holy place for the love of God, who have commended themselves to the prayers of the community by the gift of alms\". Churchmen of the highest merit were willing to come to court when both the ladies were present. All that can be safely inferred from the story is the high probability that Dunstan was exiled because he had affronted the king, the woman who became the king's wife, and her mother.\nThe marriage was politically important as part of Eadwig's efforts to strengthen his position as king, and it may have been seen as a threat by the circle around Edgar as it could have cut him out from the prospect of inheriting the crown. According to version \"D\" of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" (\"ASC D\"), in 958 \"Archbishop Oda separated King Eadwig and \u00c6lfgifu, because they were too closely related\". It is not certain what their relationship was, but Eadwig's wife has been identified as the \u00c6lfgifu who made a will naming \u00c6thelweard as her brother, and he has been identified as the chronicler \u00c6thelweard, who was descended from King \u00c6thelred I, which would have made her Eadwig's third cousin once removed.\nSimon Keynes also questions \"B\"'s account of the coronation feast, suggesting that Oda may have objected to the marriage on the ground that it was against ecclesiastical law and that \"B\"'s version may have been based on an unsuccessful attempt by Dunstan and Cynesige to dissuade him from the marriage. In the view of Michael Winterbottom and Michael Lapidge \"B's account [of the feast] is a lurid fabrication of Oda's implementation of the procedures of canon law\". On the other hand, Sean Miller argues that objections to the marriage were political rather than religious, and Pauline Stafford sees the annulment as a result of the successful revolt of Edgar, which weakened Eadwig so much that his enemies felt able to act against him.\nByrhtferth, in his hagiographical \"Life of St Oswald\", states that Eadwig, who was \"leading a wicked life\u00a0\u2013 as immoderate youth is accustomed to do\u00a0\u2013 loved another woman as if she were his own wife\"; he eloped with her, and Oda (Oswald's uncle) went on horseback to the house where she was staying, seized her and took her out of the kingdom. He then urged Eadwig to abandon his wicked ways, and henceforth the king \"knelt before Oda with contrite visage\". Some historians regard this story as a version of the account of Eadwig's marriage, but Keynes thinks that different stories about Eadwig and his women may have been conflated.\nHistorians almost all accept that the marriage between Eadwig and \u00c6lfgifu was dissolved, but Stenton was an exception, pointing out that \"ASC D\", which is a northern document dating to the second half of the eleventh century or the early twelfth, is the only source for the annulment. In his view it \"is too late to have authority on a subject which invited legendary accretions\".\nEarly reign 955\u2013957.\nEadwig's predecessor Eadred suffered from ill health which became much worse in his last years, and he relied on key advisers, including his mother Eadgifu, Archbishop Oda, Abbot Dunstan of Glastonbury, \u00c6lfsige, whom he appointed Bishop of Winchester, and \u00c6thelstan, Ealdorman of East Anglia, who was so powerful that he was known as the Half-King. Most surviving charters of the last two years of Eadred's reign were produced at Glastonbury Abbey, and almost all of these were not attested by the king, suggesting that Dunstan was authorised to issue charters in Eadred's name when he was too ill to carry out his duties. When Eadwig succeeded, the court was ruled by powerful factions. He appears to have been determined to show his independence from the previous regime from the start: the historian Ben Snook comments that \"Eadwig, unlike his brother Edgar, was clearly his own man. Immediately on coming to power, he acted to put a stop to all this.\" However, in the view of Keynes, \"whether Eadwig and Edgar were able to assert their own independence of action, or remained at the mercy of established interests at court, is unclear\".\nEadred was buried in the Old Minster, Winchester even though his will suggests that this location was not his choice. He probably wished to be buried at a reformed Benedictine monastery such as Glastonbury, but Eadwig may have wanted to ensure that his tomb would not become a focus for opponents such as Dunstan. The main beneficiary in Eadred's will was his mother Eadgifu, and Eadwig was not mentioned. She does not appear to have received the bequest as she later complained that she had been \"despoiled of all her property\", on Eadwig's accession, perhaps because he resented her power. Eadgifu had frequently attested charters in the reigns of her sons Edmund and Eadred, but she attested only one of Eadwig's, whereas Edgar was prominent at his brother's court between 955 and 957, attesting many of his charters. The position of \u00c6thelstan Half-King was too strong for Eadwig to be able to remove him, but in 956 Eadwig appointed several new ealdormen covering parts of the area in \u00c6thelstan's jurisdiction, including \u00c6thelstan's eldest son \u00c6thelwold, perhaps presaging a rearrangement.\nHistorians have often been critical of Eadwig, portraying him as irresponsible or incompetent, and the key evidence cited for this view is the exceptional number of charters he issued in 956. His sixty-odd gifts of land in that year make up around five percent of all genuine Anglo-Saxon charters, and no other ruler in Europe is known to have matched that yearly total before the twelfth century. They were mainly in favour of laymen, and it is possible that some church land was being alienated, but only a few estates are known to have formerly been in religious ownership. Historians sometimes assume that he was giving away royal property in order to buy support, but again there is little evidence for this. He may have been selling privileges, allowing landholders to convert folkland, which they already owned as hereditary family estates which owed food, rent and services to the crown, into bookland which was exempt from most obligations, thus making money but reducing the income of the crown in the long term. However, many of the estates had recently been the subject of royal charters, which means they must have already been bookland, and suggests that in some cases he may have been seizing estates and selling or giving them to his favourites. Ann Williams observes that the large number of charters may indicate that Eadwig had to buy support, but too little is known about the background to be sure. The wealth of the crown was so great that the grants do not seem to have significantly depleted its resources.\nSome of the hostility towards Eadwig was probably due to his promotion of his friends, especially \u00c6lfhere, at the expense of the old guard, such as Dunstan. \u00c6lfhere and his brothers were acknowledged by several kings as relatives, but the nature of the relationship is unknown. They were close to Eadwig and he made the eldest, \u00c6lfheah, his seneschal. \u00c6lfheah and his wife \u00c6lfswith, who was also acknowledged by Eadwig as a relative, benefited from his generosity. \u00c6lfhere, who was to become the pre-eminent lay magnate until his death in 983, was appointed an ealdorman in Mercia in 956. Other ealdormen appointed in the first year of Eadwig's reign were \u00c6thelstan Rota in Mercia and \u00c6thelstan Half-King's son \u00c6thelwold in East Anglia, while Byrhtnoth, the future hero of the Battle of Maldon, became ealdorman of Essex. These were sound appointments of men from established families and Edgar kept them when he came to power, but the rivalries between the families of \u00c6lfhere and \u00c6thelstan Half-King's son \u00c6thelwine were to destabilise the country and broke into open hostilities after Edgar's death.\nThe titles given to kings Edmund and Eadred in charters varied, with the most common being \"king of the English\". In Eadwig's charters issued before the division of the kingdom in 957, he was variously styled king of \"the Anglo-Saxons\", \"the English\", \"Albion\" and \"the whole of Britain\". Oda's attestations during Edmund's and Eadred's reigns had been longer and more boastful than those of the king, but these were cut down during Eadwig's time, no longer allowing him to overshadow his royal master.\nDivision of the kingdom 957\u2013959.\nIn the summer of 957, the kingdom was divided between Eadwig in the south and Edgar in the north, with the River Thames forming the boundary. According to \"B\", \"King Eadwig was totally abandoned by the people north [of the Thames]. They despised him for his imprudent discharge of the power entrusted to him. The wise and sensible he destroyed in a spirit of idle hatred, replacing them with ignoramuses like himself to whom he took a liking.\"\nUntil the late twentieth century most historians blamed the division on Eadwig's incompetent rule. William Hunt in his entry on Eadwig in the original \"Dictionary of National Biography\", published in 1889, stated that Eadwig carried on the government foolishly and provoked the Mercians and Northumbrians to rebellion by favouring the West Saxons. In 1922, J. Armitage Robinson saw the division as the result of a revolt by the Mercians against Eadwig's misrule, and in 1984 Henry Loyn attributed the division to Eadwig having \"alienated responsible ecclesiastical opinion\". Stenton commented that it was probably through \"mere irresponsibility\" that Eadwig lost the greater part of his kingdom, that in the society of his West Saxon friends it is likely that he lost touch with the aristocracy of remoter areas. In the twenty first century, Christopher Lewis sees the division as the solution to \"a dangerously unstable government and a court in deep crisis\", while Miller and Naismith attribute it to an unsuccessful attempt to promote a powerful new faction at the expense of the old guard.\nOther historians reject the view that the division was caused by Eadwig's failures. Four versions of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" mention the division of the kingdom, and they all describe it as the \"succession\" of Edgar to the kingship of the Mercians, as if it was a normal and expected event. \"ASC D\" and \"ASC F\" date the division to 955, whereas \"ASC B\" and \"ASC C\" correctly date it to 957. In Barbara Yorke's view, the difference in dates may be because it was always intended that Edgar would rule Mercia as a sub-king, but he was unable to act in person until he came of age when he reached the age of fourteen in 957. The Worcester charter S 633 of 956 (see the \"Charters\" section below) describes Edgar as (underking). Charters of 957 to 959 suggest that the division was a peaceful political settlement: ealdormen and bishops with jurisdictions south of the Thames stayed with Eadwig and those with northern ones with Edgar, including those who had been promoted by Eadwig. Almost all thegns who attested his charters before the division were loyal to him after it. Both Edgar's prominence as an attester of charters up to the division, and his retention as king of Mercia of ealdormen appointed by Eadwig, are evidence of continuity, and that the division of the kingdom was not a coup against Eadwig. Keynes considers both views of the division of the kingdom plausible, commenting that it may have been the result of dissatisfaction with Eadwig's rule north of the Thames, but on the other hand there would have been no presumption at that period that political unity was desirable for its own sake, and it may always have been intended that Eadwig would share the kingship with his brother.\nEadwig seems to have retained some seniority. He is described as \"King of the English\" in his charters, a title which Edgar only occasionally used; Edgar was mostly \"King of the Mercians\", and rarely also of the Northumbrians and the Britons. All coins, including those issued in Mercia, were in Eadwig's name until his death, and the historian Frederick Biggs comments that if Edgar had seized control of Mercia, it is unlikely that he would have allowed Eadwig to keep control over the area's coinage. Biggs sees the division as a survival of the early Anglo-Saxon tradition of joint kingship. Benedictine reformers such as \u00c6thelwold opposed division because they wanted uniform monastic observance, which would be jeopardised if different kings supported different practices. \u00c6thelwold criticised Eadwig for dividing the kingdom and praised Edgar for bringing it \"back to oneness\".\nThere is no evidence of rivalry between the brothers, but there were disagreements. Soon after becoming king of Mercia Edgar recalled Dunstan from his exile, and he showed his disapproval of Eadwig's treatment of their grandmother by restoring her property when he acceded to the throne of England in 959. \u00c6thelstan Half-King appears to have retired around the time of the division; he had been Edgar's foster-father and he may have thought it was the right time to hand over his responsibilities. As \u00c6lfhere was a Mercian ealdorman, he served under Edgar when the kingdom was divided even though he had been appointed by Eadwig, and he became Edgar's senior ealdorman.\nLittle is known of Eadwig after the division of the kingdom. A man called \u00c6lfric became an ealdorman in the south-east in 957, but he probably died in 958. Eadmund, probably Ealdorman of the Western Shires, had usually attested second among the lay magnates after \u00c6thelstan before the division, and after it he moved up to first in Eadwig's charters until \u00c6lfhere's brother \u00c6lfheah was promoted from seneschal to Ealdorman of Central Wessex shortly before Eadwig died, and immediately went to the head of the lay attesters.\nCharters.\nMost charters in the mid-tenth century were written in a style known as the \"diplomatic mainstream\", but there were also two other traditions, one associated with Dunstan, the Dunstan B charters, and the other with Cenwald, Bishop of Worcester, called the alliterative charters. Almost all charters of Eadwig's reign are mainstream. There are Dunstan B charters dating to the reigns of Eadred and Edgar, but none of Eadwig, while only one alliterative charter (S 633) of Eadwig is known, a grant to Worcester minster. His charters were probably drawn up by a central writing office in the king's household which had existed since the 930s. About ninety charters survive, an exceptionally large number, but analysis is limited because only seven are original documents, with the rest being later copies. The sixty dating to 956 seem to have been mainly issued on four occasions, on his coronation in late January, on around 13 February, on a third occasion which cannot be dated, and on about 29 November.\nCoinage.\nThe only coin in common use in late Anglo-Saxon England was the silver penny. The horizontal coin designs (with the moneyer's name horizontally on the reverse) in Eadwig's reign followed the three basic horizontal types of Eadred, HT1, HR1 and HR2. There were also additional horizontal types. Many HT1 coins were produced in the Midlands and South by some 35 moneyers, 17 of whom showed the mint town. There was an unexpectedly high number of HT1 coins from two York moneyers considering the shortness of Eadwig's reign, and 13 moneyers in the rest of north-east England.\nEadwig's reign saw several typological developments: especially the revival in London of the \"Bust Crowned\", with a crude portrait of the king on the obverse, and in the south-west of the \"Circumscription Cross\", with a cross on both sides of the coin in the centre and the inscriptions round the edge. These were both produced in very limited numbers, but foreshadowed more extensive use in Edgar's reign. East Anglian moneyers had generally used the \"Bust Crowned\" design since the reign of \u00c6thelstan, but may have switched temporarily to \"Horizontal\" types under Eadwig. The weight of the coins continued a gradual decline since the reign of Edward the Elder. The high silver content in the period of 85\u201395% was generally maintained, but as under Eadred there were a few less fine coins produced.\nThere is no evidence that coins were struck in the name of Edgar during Eadwig's reign, and coins of Eadwig in Mercia and Northumbria were much more common than would be expected if some had been struck in Edgar's name in 957\u2013959, indicating that all coins were struck in Eadwig's name throughout his reign.\nReligion.\nDuring Edgar's reign, the Benedictine reform movement with monasteries following strict rules of celibacy and prohibition of personal property, became dominant in religion and politics. Kings before Edgar were sympathetic to its ideals, but they did not take the view of Bishop \u00c6thelwold and his circle that it was the only worthwhile religious life, and that the secular clergy (clerks), who owned property and many of whom were married, were corrupt and immoral. Like Edmund and Eadred, Eadwig donated both to communities of Benedictine monks and of secular clergy, but he was later portrayed as an enemy of the movement who despoiled the monasteries and favoured the secular clergy. According to the Benedictine chronicler William of Malmesbury, writing in the twelfth century:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For soon, with the support of his pitiful toadies, [Eadwig] plunged all men of the monastic order all over England into undeserved calamities, first stripping them of the support of their revenues and then driving them into exile. Dunstan himself as head of all the monks was sent packing into Flanders. That was a time when all monasteries wore an unkempt and pitiful air. Even the convent of Malmesbury, where monks had dwelt for over two hundred and seventy years, he made into a bawdy house for clerks. But you, O Lord Jesus, our creator and re-creator, a skilled artificer well able to reform our deformities, used these unruly and wandering persons to bring to light and public knowledge your treasure that for so many years lay hidden\u00a0\u2013 I mean the body of St Aldhelm, which they themselves raised from the ground and established in a shrine. The prestige of those clerks was further enhanced by royal generosity, which gave the saint an estate admirably adapted both by its size and by its convenient position. All the same, even at this distance, it is horrible to remember how cruelly the king behaved to the other monasteries, being himself young and foolish, and moved too by the advice of his mistress, who constantly laid siege to his childish mind.\nEadwig gave land to \u00c6thelwold's Abingdon in many charters, leading him to be later regarded by its monks as one of its greatest royal benefactors. He is also named as a benefactor of Abingdon in a charter of 993. The construction of a new church was commenced by Eadred and completed under Edgar, but a charter of Eadwig granting Abingdon a wood for building the church suggests that the work continued during his reign. \u00c6thelwold sided with Eadwig over his marriage against Oda and Dunstan and Eadwig probably sent Edgar to be tutored by \u00c6thelwold. Religious reform does not appear to have been an important issue for Edgar and his advisers in 958, when he granted estates to the unreformed house of secular clerks at the minster church of St Werburgh in Chester, but in the 970s Benedictine reformers rewrote the history of the 950s and presented Edgar's accession as a victory for the movement over the unfit rule of Eadwig. \u00c6thelwold wrote that Eadwig \"through the ignorance of childhood[...] distributed the lands of the holy churches to rapacious strangers\". Eadwig's gifts to monasteries are numerous enough to show that he was not hostile to them, and his reputation as an opponent seems to be due to the fact that he regarded Dunstan as a personal enemy. Some early sources, such as Dunstan's biographer B and Byrhtferth, criticised Eadwig but do not list spoliation of the church among his crimes, and he was selected by some monastic forgers as the grantor of estates to their establishments, showing that he was considered a plausible benefactor.\nIn addition to Malmesbury and Abingdon, Eadwig gave land to Worcester Minster and Bampton Minster. Estates at Beccles and Elmswell which he gave to Bury St Edmunds were still in the abbey's hands at the time of the Domesday Book. He also gave land to the Bishop of London and the Archbishop of Canterbury. Southwell Minster was founded on a large estate which Eadwig gave to Oscytel, Bishop of Dorchester in 956.\nEadwig's close allies included \u00c6lfsige, who had been appointed Bishop of Winchester by Eadred in 951. \u00c6lfsige was a wealthy married man with a son, who had strong connections with the West Saxon aristocracy. He described \u00c6lfhere's brother, \u00c6lfheah, as \"my beloved friend\", and appointed him guardian of his son. \u00c6lfsige was also close to another supporter of Eadwig, Wulfric Cufing, and left him an estate in his will. \u00c6lfsige's lifestyle made him abhorrent to the reformers. He was an enemy of Oda, and Byrhtferth accused him of gloating over Oda's death and striking his tomb with his staff. When Oda died in 958, Eadwig appointed \u00c6lfsige as Archbishop of Canterbury, but he froze to death in the Alps on the way to Rome to collect his pallium. Eadwig then translated Bishop Byrhthelm of Wells to Canterbury, but when Edgar succeeded he dismissed Byrhthelm in favour of Dunstan.\nDeath.\nEadwig died on 1 October 959 and was buried in the New Minster, Winchester, which had been built by Edward the Elder to serve as a royal mausoleum. Alfred and Edward were buried there, but the only later royal entombment was that of Eadwig, associating his reign with that of his illustrious ancestors.\nReputation.\n\"B\"'s condemnation of Eadwig has influenced later opinion. From soon after his death, most judgments of him were harsh, amounting in the view of the historian Shashi Jayakumar to \"a type of \". The hostile views of Eadwig in the lives of Saints Dunstan and Oswald were adopted by post-Conquest hagiographers and monastic chroniclers. According to John of Worcester, \"Eadwig, king of the English, since he behaved foolishly in the government entrusted to him, was abandoned by the Mercians and the Northumbrians with contempt\". To William of Malmesbury he \"was a wanton youth, and one who misused his personal beauty in lascivious behaviour\".\nSome contemporaries were more sympathetic. \u00c6thelweard, who may have been Eadwig's brother-in-law, wrote that \"he for his great beauty got the nickname \"All-fair\" from the common people. He held the kingdom continuously for four years, and deserved to be loved.\" The New Minster, where he was buried, also remembered him favourably, saying in its tenth century history that he was \"mourned by many tears of his people\". The Minster was a beneficiary of \u00c6lfgifu's will, and its is one of the few sources to describe her as Eadwig's wife. In the late tenth or early eleventh century, a slave was freed in his memory at St Petroc's Church in Cornwall. \u00c6thelred the Unready named his sons after his predecessors, and his fifth son was named Eadwig.\nModern historians generally reject \"B\"'s verdict. Williams sees his comments as \"mere spite\" from a partisan of Dunstan. Snook says that \"B\" \"conducted a comprehensive hatchet-job on Eadwig's reputation, portraying him as an incompetent, lecherous, vengeful, impious tyrant\". \"B\" and his successors wrote \"all manner of puerile prattle about his impiety and his unsuitability for high office\". In Keynes's view:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStafford comments:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Eadwig left no family to cultivate his memory, was too easy a target for the moralists-in-politics of the late tenth century. The circumstances of his brief reign were complex and some arguments against him must have been strictly contemporary, part of the debate about succession which took place between 955 and 957. At best we have received only half of those arguments, those used to bury Eadwig not to praise him.\nSnook gives the most favourable modern verdict:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther historians are more cautious. Williams comments that \"much is still obscure about the politics of Eadwig's reign\", and Richard Huscroft agrees, saying that \"the evidence about Eadwig's reign remains obscure and ambiguous\".\nIn art and literature.\nThe story of Eadwig and \u00c6lfgifu was a popular subject for artists, playwrights and poets in the second half of the eighteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth. Artists included William Bromley, who showed his \"The Insolence of Dunstan to King Edwy\" at the Royal Academy, William Hamilton (see image), William Dyce and Richard Dadd, while there were poems such as \"Edwy: a Dramatic Poem\" by Thomas Warwick in 1784. Another poem, Thomas Sedgwick Whalley's \"Edwy and Edilda\", was published in 1779. Fanny Burney's play, \"Edwy and Elgiva\", was performed at the Drury Lane Theatre on 21 March 1795 with Charles Kemble as Edwy and Sarah Siddons as Elgiva, but closed after one disastrous performance.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

IP over Avian Carriers was initially described in issued by the Internet Engineering Task Force, written by David Waitzman, and released on April 1, 1990. It is one of several April Fools' Day Request for Comments.\nWaitzman described an improvement of his protocol in , \"IP over Avian Carriers with Quality of Service\" (1 April 1999). Later, in \u2014released on 1 April 2011, and 13 years after the introduction of IPv6\u2014Brian Carpenter and Robert Hinden published \"Adaptation of RFC 1149 for IPv6\".\nIPoAC has been successfully implemented, but for only nine packets of data, with a packet loss ratio of 55% (due to operator error), and a response time ranging from to over . Thus, this technology suffers from extremely high latency.\nReal-life implementation.\nOn 28 April 2001, IPoAC was implemented by the Bergen Linux user group, under the name CPIP (Carrier Pigeon Internet Protocol). They sent nine packets over a distance of approximately , each carried by an individual pigeon and containing one ping (ICMP echo request), and received four responses.\nThis real-life implementation was mentioned by the French member of parliament Martine Billard in the French National Assembly, during debates about HADOPI.\nRisks.\nIn December 2005, a Gartner report on bird flu that concluded \"A pandemic wouldn't affect IT systems directly\" was humorously criticized for neglecting to consider RFC 1149 and RFC 2549 in its analysis.\nKnown risks to the protocol include:\nOther avian data transfer methods.\nRafting photographers already use pigeons as a sneakernet to transport digital photos on flash media from the camera to the tour operator. Over a distance, a single pigeon may be able to carry tens of gigabytes of data in around an hour, which on an average bandwidth basis compared very favorably to early ADSL standards, even when accounting for lost drives.\nOn March 12, 2004, Yossi Vardi, Ami Ben-Bassat, and Guy Vardi sent three homing pigeons a distance of , \"each carrying 20\u201322 tiny memory cards containing 1.3\u00a0GB, amounting in total of 4\u00a0GB of data.\" An effective throughput of 2.27 Mbit/s was achieved. The purpose of the test was to measure and confirm an improvement over RFC 2549.\nInspired by RFC 2549, on 9 September 2009, the marketing team of The Unlimited, a regional company in South Africa, decided to host a tongue-in-cheek pigeon race between their pet pigeon Winston and local telecom company Telkom SA. The race was to send 4 gigabytes of data from Howick to Hillcrest, approximately apart. The pigeon carried a microSD card and competed against a Telkom ADSL line. Winston beat the data transfer over Telkom's ADSL line, with a total time of two hours, six minutes and 57 seconds from uploading data on the microSD card to completion of download from the card. At the time of Winston's victory, the ADSL transfer was just under 4% complete.\nIn November 2009, the Australian comedy/current-affairs television program \"Hungry Beast\" repeated this experiment. The \"Hungry Beast\" team took up the challenge after a parliament session wherein the government of the time criticised the opposition for not supporting telecommunications investments, saying that if the opposition had their way, Australians would be doing data transfer over carrier pigeons. The \"Hungry Beast\" team had read about the South African experiment and assumed that, as a developed Western country, Australia would have higher speeds. The experiment had the team transfer a 700 MB file via three delivery methods to determine which was the fastest: a carrier pigeon with a microSD card, a car carrying a USB stick, and a Telstra (Australia's largest telecom provider) ADSL line. The data was to be transferred from Tarana in rural New South Wales to the western-Sydney suburb of Prospect, New South Wales, a distance of by road. Approximately halfway through the race, the internet connection unexpectedly dropped and the transfer had to be restarted. The pigeon won the race with a time of approximately 1 hour 5 minutes, the car came in second at 2 hours 10 minutes, while the internet transfer did not finish, having dropped out a second time and not coming back. The estimated time to upload completion at one point was as high as 9 hours, and at no point did the estimated upload time fall below 4 hours.\nA similar pigeon race was conducted in September 2010 by tech blogger (trefor.net) and ISP Timico CTO Trefor Davies with farmer Michelle Brumfield in rural Yorkshire, England: delivering a five-minute video to a BBC correspondent 75 miles away in Skegness. The pigeon (carrying a memory card with a 300 MB HD video of Davies having a haircut) was pitted against an upload to YouTube via British Telecom broadband; the pigeon was released at 11:05 am and arrived in the loft one hour and fifteen minutes later while the upload was still incomplete, having failed once in the interim.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "47107", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47107", "title": "Phosgene", "text": "Toxic gaseous compound (COCl2)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nPhosgene is an organic chemical compound with the formula . It is a toxic, colorless gas; in low concentrations, its musty odor resembles that of freshly cut hay or grass. It can be thought of chemically as the double acyl chloride analog of carbonic acid, or structurally as formaldehyde with the hydrogen atoms replaced by chlorine atoms. In 2013, about 75\u201380 % of global phosgene was consumed for isocyanates, 18% for polycarbonates and about 5% for other fine chemicals.\nPhosgene is extremely poisonous and was used as a chemical weapon during World War I, where it was responsible for 85,000 deaths. It is a highly potent pulmonary irritant and quickly filled enemy trenches due to it being a heavy gas.\nIt is classified as a Schedule 3 substance under the Chemical Weapons Convention. In addition to its industrial production, small amounts occur from the breakdown and the combustion of organochlorine compounds, such as chloroform.\nStructure and basic properties.\nPhosgene is a planar molecule as predicted by VSEPR theory. The C=O distance is 1.18\u00a0\u00c5, the C\u2212Cl distance is 1.74\u00a0\u00c5 and the Cl\u2212C\u2212Cl angle is 111.8\u00b0. Phosgene is a carbon oxohalide and it can be considered one of the simplest acyl chlorides, being formally derived from carbonic acid.\nProduction.\nIndustrially, phosgene is produced by passing purified carbon monoxide and chlorine gas through a bed of porous activated carbon, which serves as a catalyst:\n (\u0394\"H\"rxn = \u2212107.6 kJ/mol)\nThis reaction is exothermic and is typically performed between 50 and 150\u00a0\u00b0C. Above 200\u00a0\u00b0C, phosgene reverts to carbon monoxide and chlorine, \"K\"eq(300\u00a0K) = 0.05. World production of this compound was estimated to be 2.74 million tonnes in 1989.\nPhosgene is fairly simple to produce, but is listed as a Schedule 3 substance under the Chemical Weapons Convention. As such, it is usually considered too dangerous to transport in bulk quantities. Instead, phosgene is usually produced and consumed within the same plant, as part of an \"on demand\" process. This involves maintaining equivalent rates of production and consumption, which keeps the amount of phosgene in the system at any one time fairly low, reducing the risks in the event of an accident. Some batch production does still take place, but efforts are made to reduce the amount of phosgene stored.\nInadvertent generation.\nAtmospheric chemistry.\nSimple organochlorides slowly convert into phosgene when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation in the presence of oxygen. Before the discovery of the ozone hole in the late 1970s large quantities of organochlorides were routinely used by industry, which inevitably led to them entering the atmosphere. In the 1970-80s phosgene levels in the troposphere were around 20-30 parts per trillion by volume (peak 60 parts per trillion by volume). These levels had not decreased significantly nearly 30 years later, despite organochloride production becoming restricted under the Montreal Protocol.\nPhosgene in the troposphere can last up to about 70 days and is removed primarily by hydrolysis with ambient humidity or cloudwater. Less than 1% makes it to the stratosphere, where it is expected to have a lifetime of several years, since this layer is much drier and phosgene decomposes slowly through UV photolysis. It plays a minor part in ozone depletion.\nCombustion.\nCarbon tetrachloride () can turn into phosgene when exposed to heat in air. This was a problem as carbon tetrachloride is an effective fire suppressant and was formerly in widespread use in fire extinguishers. There are reports of fatalities caused by its use to fight fires in confined spaces. Carbon tetrachloride's generation of phosgene and its own toxicity mean it is no longer used for this purpose.\nBiologically.\nPhosgene is also formed as a metabolite of chloroform, likely via the action of cytochrome P-450.\nHistory.\nPhosgene was synthesized by the Cornish chemist John Davy (1790\u20131868) in 1812 by exposing a mixture of carbon monoxide and chlorine to sunlight. He named it \"phosgene\" from Greek (, light) and (, to give birth) in reference of the use of light to promote the reaction. It gradually became important in the chemical industry as the 19th century progressed, particularly in dye manufacturing.\nReactions and uses.\nThe reaction of an organic substrate with phosgene is called phosgenation. Phosgenation of diols give carbonates (R = H, alkyl, aryl), which can be either linear or cyclic:\nAn example is the reaction of phosgene with bisphenol A to form polycarbonates. Phosgenation of diamines gives di-isocyanates, like toluene diisocyanate (TDI), methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). In these conversions, phosgene is used in excess to increase yield and minimize side reactions. The phosgene excess is separated during the work-up of resulting end products and recycled into the process, with any remaining phosgene decomposed in water using activated carbon as the catalyst. Diisocyanates are precursors to polyurethanes. More than 90% of the phosgene is used in these processes, with the biggest production units located in the United States (Texas and Louisiana), Germany, Shanghai, Japan, and South Korea. The most important producers are Dow Chemical, Covestro, and BASF. Phosgene is also used to produce monoisocyanates, used as pesticide precursors (\"e.g.\" methyl isocyanate (MIC).\nAside from the widely used reactions described above, phosgene is also used to produce acyl chlorides from carboxylic acids:\nFor this application, thionyl chloride is commonly used instead of phosgene.\nLaboratory uses.\nThe synthesis of isocyanates from amines illustrates the electrophilic character of this reagent and its use in introducing the equivalent synthon \"CO2+\":\n, where R = alkyl, aryl\nSuch reactions are conducted on laboratory scale in the presence of a base such as pyridine that neutralizes the hydrogen chloride side-product.\nPhosgene is used to produce chloroformates such as benzyl chloroformate:\nIn these syntheses, phosgene is used in excess to prevent formation of the corresponding carbonate ester.\nWith amino acids, phosgene (or its trimer) reacts to give amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides. More generally, phosgene acts to link two nucleophiles by a carbonyl group. For this purpose, alternatives to phosgene such as carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) are safer, albeit expensive. CDI itself is prepared by reacting phosgene with imidazole.\nPhosgene is stored in metal cylinders. In the US, the cylinder valve outlet is a tapered thread known as \"CGA 160\" that is used only for phosgene.\nAlternatives to phosgene.\nIn the research laboratory, due to safety concerns phosgene nowadays finds limited use in organic synthesis. A variety of substitutes have been developed, notably trichloromethyl chloroformate (\"diphosgene\"), a liquid at room temperature, and bis(trichloromethyl) carbonate (\"triphosgene\"), a crystalline substance.\nOther reactions.\nPhosgene reacts with water to release hydrogen chloride and carbon dioxide:\nAnalogously, upon contact with ammonia, it converts to urea:\nHalide exchange with nitrogen trifluoride and aluminium tribromide gives and , respectively.\nChemical warfare.\nIt is listed on Schedule 3 of the Chemical Weapons Convention: All production sites manufacturing more than 30 tonnes per year must be declared to the OPCW. Although less toxic than many other chemical weapons such as sarin, phosgene is still regarded as a viable chemical warfare agent because of its simpler manufacturing requirements when compared to that of more technically advanced chemical weapons such as tabun, a first-generation nerve agent.\nPhosgene was first deployed as a chemical weapon by the French in 1915 in World War I. It was also used in a mixture with an equal volume of chlorine, with the chlorine helping to spread the denser phosgene. Phosgene was more potent than chlorine, though some symptoms took 24 hours or more to manifest.\nFollowing the extensive use of phosgene during World War I, it was stockpiled by various countries.\nPhosgene was then only infrequently used by the Imperial Japanese Army against the Chinese during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Gas weapons, such as phosgene, were produced by the IJA's Unit 731.\nToxicology and safety.\nPhosgene is an insidious poison as the odor may not be noticed and symptoms may be slow to appear.\nAt low concentrations, phosgene may have a pleasant odor of freshly mown hay or green corn, but has also been described as sweet, like rotten banana peels.\nThe odor detection threshold for phosgene is 0.4 ppm, four times the threshold limit value (time weighted average). Its high toxicity arises from the action of the phosgene on the , and groups of the proteins in pulmonary alveoli (the site of gas exchange), respectively forming ester, amide and thioester functional groups in accord with the reactions discussed above. This results in disruption of the blood\u2013air barrier, eventually causing pulmonary edema. The extent of damage in the alveoli does not primarily depend on phosgene concentration in the inhaled air, with the dose (amount of inhaled phosgene) being the critical factor. Dose can be approximately calculated as \"concentration\" \u00d7 \"duration of exposure\". Therefore, persons in workplaces where there exists risk of accidental phosgene release usually wear indicator badges close to the nose and mouth. Such badges indicate the approximate inhaled dose, which allows for immediate treatment if the monitored dose rises above safe limits.\nIn case of low or moderate quantities of inhaled phosgene, the exposed person is to be monitored and subjected to precautionary therapy, then released after several hours. For higher doses of inhaled phosgene (above 150 ppm \u00d7 min) a pulmonary edema often develops which can be detected by X-ray imaging and regressive blood oxygen concentration. Inhalation of such high doses can eventually result in fatality within hours up to 2\u20133 days of the exposure.\nThe risk connected to a phosgene inhalation is based not so much on its toxicity (which is much lower in comparison to modern chemical weapons like sarin or tabun) but rather on its typical effects: the affected person may not develop any symptoms for hours until an edema appears, at which point it could be too late for medical treatment to assist. Nearly all fatalities as a result of accidental releases from the industrial handling of phosgene occurred in this fashion. On the other hand, pulmonary edemas treated in a timely manner usually heal in the mid- and longterm, without major consequences once some days or weeks after exposure have passed. Nonetheless, the detrimental health effects on pulmonary function from untreated, chronic low-level exposure to phosgene should not be ignored; although not exposed to concentrations high enough to immediately cause an edema, many synthetic chemists (\"e.g.\" Leonidas Zervas) working with the compound were reported to experience chronic respiratory health issues and eventual respiratory failure from continuous low-level exposure.\nIf accidental release of phosgene occurs in an industrial or laboratory setting, it can be mitigated with ammonia gas; in the case of liquid spills (\"e.g.\" of diphosgene or phosgene solutions) an absorbent and sodium carbonate can be applied.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He ruled the empire at its territorial peak, when it included much of West Asia, parts of the Balkans (Thrace\u2013Macedonia and Paeonia) and the Caucasus, most of the Black Sea's coastal regions, Central Asia, the Indus Valley in the far east, and portions of North Africa and Northeast Africa including Egypt (\"Mudr\u00e2ya\"), eastern Libya, and coastal Sudan.\nDarius ascended the throne after overthrowing the Achaemenid monarch Bardiya (or \"Smerdis\"), who he claimed was in fact an imposter named Gaumata. The new king met with rebellions throughout the empire but quelled each of them; a major event of Darius's career described in Greek historiography was his punitive expedition against Athens and Eretria for their participation in the Ionian Revolt.\nDarius organized the empire by dividing it into administrative provinces, each governed by a satrap. He organized Achaemenid coinage as a new uniform monetary system, and he made Aramaic a co-official language of the empire alongside Old Persian. He also put the empire in better standing by improving roads and introducing standard weights and measures. Through these changes, the Achaemenid Empire became centralized and unified. Darius undertook other construction projects throughout his realm, primarily focusing on Susa, Pasargadae, Persepolis, Babylon, and Egypt. He had an inscription carved upon a cliff-face of Mount Behistun to record his conquests, which would later become important evidence of the Old Persian language.\nEtymology.\n and are the Latin forms of the Greek (), itself from Old Persian (, ; which is a shortened form of \"D\u0101rayava\u02b0u\u0161\" (, ). The longer Persian form is reflected in the Elamite , Babylonian , and Aramaic () forms, and possibly in the longer Greek form, (). The name in nominative form means \"he who holds firm the good(ness)\", which can be seen by the first part , meaning \"holder\", and the adverb , meaning \"goodness\".\nPrimary sources.\nAt some time between his coronation and his death, Darius left a tri-lingual monumental relief on Mount Behistun, which was written in Elamite, Old Persian and Babylonian. The inscription begins with a brief autobiography including his ancestry and lineage. To aid the presentation of his ancestry, Darius wrote down the sequence of events that occurred after the death of Cyrus the Great. Darius mentions several times that he is the rightful king by the grace of the supreme deity Ahura Mazda. In addition, further texts and monuments from Persepolis have been found, as well as a clay tablet containing an Old Persian cuneiform of Darius from Gherla, Romania (Harmatta) and a letter from Darius to Gadates, preserved in a Greek text of the Roman period. In the foundation tablets of Apadana Palace, Darius described in Old Persian cuneiform the extent of his Empire in broad geographical terms:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Darius the great king, king of kings, king of countries, son of Hystaspes, an Achaemenid. King Darius says: This is the kingdom which I hold, from the Sacae who are beyond Sogdia to Kush, and from Sind (Old Persian: , \"Hidauv\", locative of \"Hidu\u0161\", i.e. \"Indus valley\") to Lydia (Old Persian: \"Spard\u00e2\") \u2013 [this is] what Ahuramazda, the greatest of gods, bestowed upon me. May Ahuramazda protect me and my royal house!\"\u2014\u200a\nHerodotus, a Greek historian and author of \"The Histories\", provided an account of many Persian kings and the Greco-Persian Wars. He wrote extensively on Darius, spanning half of Book 3 along with Books 4, 5 and 6. It begins with the removal of the alleged usurper Gaumata and continues to the end of Darius's reign.\nEarly life.\nDarius was the eldest of five sons to Hystaspes. The identity of his mother is uncertain. According to the modern historian Alireza Shapour Shahbazi (1994), Darius's mother was thought to have been a woman named Rhodogune. However, according to Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones (2013), recently uncovered texts in Persepolis indicate that his mother was Irdabama, an affluent landowner descended from a family of local Elamite rulers. Richard Stoneman likewise refers to Irdabama as the mother of Darius. The Behistun Inscription of Darius states that his father was satrap of Bactria in 522 BCE. According to Herodotus (III.139), Darius, prior to seizing power and \"of no consequence at the time\", had served as a spearman (\"doryphoros\") in the Egyptian campaign (528\u2013525 BCE) of Cambyses II, then the Persian Great King; this is often interpreted to mean he was the king's personal spear-carrier, an important role. Hystaspes was an officer in Cyrus's army and a noble of his court.\nBefore Cyrus and his army crossed the river Araxes to battle with the Armenians, he installed his son Cambyses II as king in case he should not return from battle. However, once Cyrus had crossed the Aras River, he had a vision in which Darius had wings atop his shoulders and stood upon the confines of Europe and Asia (the known world). When Cyrus awoke from the dream, he inferred it as a great danger to the future security of the empire, as it meant that Darius would one day rule the whole world. However, his son Cambyses was the heir to the throne, not Darius, causing Cyrus to wonder if Darius was forming treasonable and ambitious designs. This led Cyrus to order Hystaspes to go back to Persis and watch over his son strictly, until Cyrus himself returned.\nAccession.\nThere are different accounts of the rise of Darius to the throne from both Darius himself and Greek historians. The oldest records report a convoluted sequence of events in which Cambyses II lost his mind, had his brother Bardiya murdered, and died from an infected leg wound. After this, Darius and a group of six nobles travelled to Sikayauvati to kill an usurper, Gaumata, who had taken the throne by pretending to be Bardiya during the true king's absence.\nDarius's account, written at the Behistun Inscription, states that Cambyses II killed his own brother Bardiya, but that this murder was not known among the Iranian people. A would-be usurper named Gaumata came and lied to the people, stating that he was Bardiya. The Iranians had grown rebellious against Cambyses's rule and, on 11 March 522 BCE, a revolt against Cambyses broke out in his absence. On 1 July, the Iranian people chose to be under the leadership of Gaumata, as \"Bardiya\". No member of the Achaemenid family would rise against Gaumata for the safety of their own life. Darius, who had served Cambyses as his lance-bearer until the deposed ruler's death, prayed for aid and, in September 522 BCE, along with Otanes, Intaphrenes, Gobryas, Hydarnes, Megabyzus and Aspathines, killed Gaumata in the fortress of Sikayauvati.\nHerodotus provides a dubious account of Darius's ascension: Several days after Gaumata had been assassinated, Darius and the other six nobles discussed the fate of the empire. At first, the seven discussed the form of government: A democratic republic (\"Isonomia\") was strongly pushed by Otanes, an oligarchy was pushed by Megabyzus, while Darius pushed for a monarchy. After stating that a republic would lead to corruption and internal fighting, while a monarchy would be led with a single-mindedness not possible in other governments, Darius was able to convince the other nobles.\nTo decide who would become the monarch, six of them decided on a test, with Otanes abstaining, as he had no interest in being king. They were to gather outside the palace, mounted on their horses at sunrise, and the man whose horse neighed first in recognition of the rising sun would become king. According to Herodotus, Darius had a slave, Oebares, who rubbed his hand over the genitals of a mare that Darius's horse favoured. When the six gathered, Oebares placed his hands beside the nostrils of Darius's horse, who became excited at the scent and neighed. This was followed by lightning and thunder, leading the others to dismount and kneel before Darius in recognition of his apparent divine providence. In this account, Darius himself claimed that he achieved the throne not through fraud, but cunning, even erecting a statue of himself mounted on his neighing horse with the inscription: \"Darius, son of Hystaspes, obtained the sovereignty of Persia by the sagacity of his horse and the ingenious contrivance of Oebares, his groom.\"\nAccording to the accounts of Greek historians, Cambyses II had left Patizeithes in charge of the kingdom when he headed for Egypt. He later sent Prexaspes to murder Bardiya. After the killing, Patizeithes put his brother Gaumata, a Magian who resembled Bardiya, on the throne and declared him the Great King. Otanes discovered that Gaumata was an impostor, and along with six other Iranian nobles, including Darius, created a plan to oust the pseudo-Bardiya. After killing the impostor along with his brother Patizeithes and other Magians, Darius was crowned king the following morning.\nThe details regarding Darius's rise to power is generally acknowledged as forgery and was in reality used as a concealment of his overthrow and murder of Cyrus's rightful successor, Bardiya. To legitimize his rule, Darius had a common origin fabricated between himself and Cyrus by designating Achaemenes as the eponymous founder of their dynasty. In reality, Darius was not from the same house as Cyrus and his forebears, the rulers of Anshan.\nEarly reign.\nEarly revolts.\nFollowing his coronation at Pasargadae, Darius moved to Ecbatana. He soon learned that support for Bardiya was strong, and revolts in Elam and Babylonia had broken out. Darius ended the Elamite revolt when the revolutionary leader Aschina was captured and executed in Susa. After three months the revolt in Babylonia had ended. While in Babylonia, Darius learned a revolution had broken out in Bactria, a satrapy which had always been in favour of Darius, and had initially sent an army of soldiers to quell revolts. Following this, revolts broke out in Persis, the homeland of the Persians and Darius and then in Elam and Babylonia, followed by in Media, Parthia, Assyria, and Egypt.\nBy 522 BCE, there were revolts against Darius in most parts of the Achaemenid Empire leaving the empire in turmoil. Even though Darius did not seem to have the support of the populace, Darius had a loyal army, led by close confidants and nobles (including the six nobles who had helped him remove Gaumata). With their support, Darius was able to suppress and quell all revolts within a year. In Darius's words, he had killed a total of nine \"lying kings\" through the quelling of revolutions. Darius left a detailed account of these revolts in the Behistun Inscription.\nElimination of Intaphernes.\nOne of the significant events of Darius's early reign was the slaying of Intaphernes, one of the seven noblemen who had deposed the previous ruler and installed Darius as the new monarch. The seven had made an agreement that they could all visit the new king whenever they pleased, except when he was with a woman. One evening, Intaphernes went to the palace to meet Darius, but was stopped by two officers who stated that Darius was with a woman. Becoming enraged and insulted, Intaphernes drew his sword and cut off the ears and noses of the two officers. While leaving the palace, he took the bridle from his horse, and tied the two officers together.\nThe officers went to the king and showed him what Intaphernes had done to them. Darius began to fear for his own safety; he thought that all seven noblemen had banded together to rebel against him and that the attack against his officers was the first sign of revolt. He sent a messenger to each of the noblemen, asking them if they approved of Intaphernes's actions. They denied and disavowed any connection with Intaphernes's actions, stating that they stood by their decision to appoint Darius as King of Kings. Darius's choice to ask the noblemen indicates that he was not yet completely sure of his authority.\nTaking precautions against further resistance, Darius sent soldiers to seize Intaphernes, along with his son, family members, relatives and any friends who were capable of arming themselves. Darius believed that Intaphernes was planning a rebellion, but when he was brought to the court, there was no proof of any such plan. Nonetheless, Darius killed Intaphernes's entire family, excluding his wife's brother and son. She was asked to choose between her brother and son. She chose her brother to live. Her reasoning for doing so was that she could have another husband and another son, but she would always have but one brother. Darius was impressed by her response and spared both her brother's and her son's life.\nMilitary campaigns.\nEgyptian campaign.\nAfter securing his authority over the empire, Darius embarked on a campaign to Egypt where he defeated the rebel forces and secured the lands that Cambyses had conquered while incorporating a large portion of Egypt into the Achaemenid Empire. According to the Bisitun inscription, the Egyptian rebellion began while Darius was in Babylon dealing with the rebellion there. It has been suggested that the inclusion of Egypt among the list of rebelling provinces in this inscription was a scribal error, and various dates are possible for an actual rebellion. Likewise, the identity of the rebel leader is not known, but it has been suggested to be Petubastis III.\nThrough another series of campaigns, Darius I would eventually reign over the territorial apex of the empire, when it stretched from parts of the Balkans (Thrace-Macedonia, Bulgaria-Paeonia) in the west, to the Indus Valley in the east.\nInvasion of the Indus Valley.\nIn 516 BCE, Darius embarked on a campaign to Central Asia, Aria and Bactria and then marched into Afghanistan to Taxila in modern-day Pakistan. Darius spent the winter of 516\u2013515 BCE in Gandhara, preparing to conquer the Indus Valley. Darius conquered the lands surrounding the Indus River in 515 BCE. Darius I controlled the Indus Valley from Gandhara to modern Karachi and appointed the Greek Scylax of Caryanda to explore the Indian Ocean from the mouth of the Indus to Suez.\nBabylonian revolt.\nAfter Bardiya was murdered, widespread revolts occurred throughout the empire, especially on the eastern side. Darius asserted his position as king by force, taking his armies throughout the empire, suppressing each revolt individually. The most notable of all these revolts was the Babylonian revolt which was led by Nebuchadnezzar III. This revolt occurred when Otanes withdrew much of the army from Babylon to aid Darius in suppressing other revolts. Darius felt that the Babylonian people had taken advantage of him and deceived him, which resulted in Darius gathering a large army and marching to Babylon. At Babylon, Darius was met with closed gates and a series of defences to keep him and his armies out.\nDarius encountered mockery and taunting from the rebels, including the famous saying \"Oh yes, you will capture our city, when mules shall have foals.\" For a year and a half, Darius and his armies were unable to retake the city, though he attempted many tricks and strategies\u2014even copying that which Cyrus the Great had employed when he captured Babylon. However, the situation changed in Darius's favour when, according to the story, a mule owned by Zopyrus, a high-ranking soldier, foaled. Following this, a plan was hatched for Zopyrus to pretend to be a deserter, enter the Babylonian camp, and gain the trust of the Babylonians. The plan was successful and Darius's army eventually surrounded the city and overcame the rebels.\nDuring this revolt, Scythian nomads took advantage of the disorder and chaos and invaded Persia. Darius first finished defeating the rebels in Elam, Assyria, and Babylon and then attacked the Scythian invaders. He pursued the invaders, who led him to a marsh; there he found no known enemies but an enigmatic Scythian tribe. He managed to capture the Scythian king Skunkha and added him to the other rebel kings depicted in the Behistun Inscription.\nEuropean Scythian campaign.\nThe Scythians were a group of north Iranian nomadic tribes, speaking an Eastern Iranian language (Scythian languages) who had invaded Media, killed Cyrus in battle, revolted against Darius and threatened to disrupt trade between Central Asia and the shores of the Black Sea as they lived between the Danube River, River Don and the Black Sea.\nDarius crossed the Black Sea at the Bosphorus Straits using a bridge of boats. Darius conquered large portions of Eastern Europe, even crossing the Danube to wage war on the Scythians. Darius invaded European Scythia in 513 BCE, where the Scythians evaded Darius's army, using feints and retreating eastwards while laying waste to the countryside, by blocking wells, intercepting convoys, destroying pastures and continuous skirmishes against Darius's army. Seeking to fight with the Scythians, Darius's army chased the Scythian army deep into Scythian lands, where there were no cities to conquer and no supplies to forage. In frustration Darius sent a letter to the Scythian ruler Idanthyrsus to fight or surrender. The ruler replied that he would not stand and fight with Darius until they found the graves of their fathers and tried to destroy them. Until then, they would continue their strategy as they had no cities or cultivated lands to lose.\nDespite the evading tactics of the Scythians, Darius's campaign was so far relatively successful. As presented by Herodotus, the tactics used by the Scythians resulted in the loss of their best lands and of damage to their loyal allies. This gave Darius the initiative. As he moved eastwards in the cultivated lands of the Scythians in Eastern Europe proper, he remained resupplied by his fleet and lived to an extent off the land. While moving eastwards in the European Scythian lands, he captured the large fortified city of the Budini, one of the allies of the Scythians, and burnt it.\nDarius eventually ordered a halt at the banks of Oarus, where he built \"eight great forts, some distant from each other\", no doubt as a frontier defence. In his \"Histories\", Herodotus states that the ruins of the forts were still standing in his day. After chasing the Scythians for a month, Darius's army was suffering losses due to fatigue, privation and sickness. Concerned about losing more of his troops, Darius halted the march at the banks of the Volga River and headed towards Thrace. He had conquered enough Scythian territory to force the Scythians to respect the Persian forces.\nPersian invasion of Greece.\nDarius's European expedition was a major event in his reign, which began with the invasion of Thrace. Darius also conquered many cities of the northern Aegean, Paeonia, while Macedonia submitted voluntarily, after the demand of earth and water, becoming a vassal kingdom. He then left Megabyzus to conquer Thrace, returning to Sardis to spend the winter. The Greeks living in Asia Minor and some of the Greek islands had submitted to Persian rule already by 510 BCE. Nonetheless, there were certain Greeks who were pro-Persian, although these were largely based in Athens. To improve Greek-Persian relations, Darius opened his court and treasuries to those Greeks who wanted to serve him. These Greeks served as soldiers, artisans, statesmen and mariners for Darius. However, the increasing concerns among the Greeks over the strength of Darius's kingdom along with the constant interference by the Greeks in Ionia and Lydia were stepping stones towards the conflict that was yet to come between Persia and certain of the leading Greek city states.\nWhen Aristagoras organized the Ionian Revolt, Eretria and Athens supported him by sending ships and troops to Ionia and by burning Sardis. Persian military and naval operations to quell the revolt ended in the Persian reoccupation of Ionian and Greek islands, as well as the re-subjugation of Thrace and the conquering of Macedonia in 492\u00a0BCE under Mardonius. Macedon had been a vassal kingdom of the Persians since the late 6th century\u00a0BCE, but retained autonomy. Mardonius's 492 campaign made it a fully subordinate part of the Persian kingdom. These military actions, coming as a direct response to the revolt in Ionia, were the beginning of the first Persian invasion of mainland Greece. At the same time, anti-Persian parties gained more power in Athens, and pro-Persian aristocrats were exiled from Athens and Sparta.\nDarius responded by sending troops led by his son-in-law across the Hellespont. However, a violent storm and harassment by the Thracians forced the troops to return to Persia. Seeking revenge on Athens and Eretria, Darius assembled another army of 20,000 men under his Admiral, Datis, and his nephew Artaphernes, who met success when they captured Eretria and advanced to Marathon. In 490\u00a0BCE, at the Battle of Marathon, the Persian army was defeated by a heavily armed Athenian army, with 9,000 men who were supported by 600 Plataeans and 10,000 lightly armed soldiers led by Miltiades. The defeat at Marathon marked the end of the first Persian invasion of Greece. Darius began preparations for a second force which he would command, instead of his generals; however, before the preparations were complete, Darius died, thus leaving the task to his son Xerxes.\nFamily.\nDarius was the son of Hystaspes and the grandson of Arsames. Darius married Atossa, daughter of Cyrus, with whom he had four sons: Xerxes, Achaemenes, Masistes and Hystaspes. He also married Artystone, another daughter of Cyrus, with whom he had two known sons, Arsames and Gobryas. Darius married Parmys, the daughter of Bardiya, with whom he had a son, Ariomardus. Furthermore, Darius married his niece Phratagune, with whom he had two sons, Abrokomas and Hyperantes. He also married another woman of the nobility, Phaidyme, the daughter of Otanes. It is unknown if he had any children with her. Before these royal marriages, Darius had married an unknown daughter of his good friend and lance carrier Gobryas from an early marriage, with whom he had three sons, Artobazanes, Ariabignes and Arsamenes. Any daughters he had with her are not known. Although Artobazanes was Darius's first-born, Xerxes became heir and the next king through the influence of Atossa; she had great authority in the kingdom as Darius loved her the most of all his wives.\nDeath and succession.\nAfter becoming aware of the Persian defeat at the Battle of Marathon, Darius began planning another expedition against the Greek city-states; this time, he, not Datis, would command the imperial armies. Darius had spent three years preparing men and ships for war when a revolt broke out in Egypt. This revolt in Egypt worsened his failing health and prevented the possibility of his leading another army. Soon afterwards, Darius died, after thirty days of suffering through an unidentified illness, partially due to his part in crushing the revolt, at about sixty-four years old. In October 486 BCE, his body was embalmed and entombed in the rock-cut tomb at Naqsh-e Rostam, which he had been preparing. An inscription on his tomb introduces him as \"Great King, King of Kings, King of countries containing all kinds of men, King in this great earth far and wide, son of Hystaspes, an Achaemenian, a Persian, son of a Persian, an Aryan, having Aryan lineage.\" A relief under his tomb portraying equestrian combat was later carved during the reign of the Sasanian King of Kings, Bahram II (r.\u2009274\u00a0\u2013\u00a0293\u00a0CE).\nXerxes, the eldest son of Darius and Atossa, succeeded to the throne as Xerxes I; before his accession, he had contested the succession with his elder half-brother Artobarzanes, Darius's eldest son, who was born to his first wife before Darius rose to power. With Xerxes's accession, the empire was again ruled by a member of the house of Cyrus.\nGovernment.\nOrganization.\nEarly in his reign, Darius wanted to reorganize the structure of the empire and reform the system of taxation he inherited from Cyrus and Cambyses. To do this, Darius created twenty provinces called satrapies (or \"archi\") which were each assigned to a satrap (\"archon\") and specified fixed tributes that the satrapies were required to pay. A complete list is preserved in the catalogue of Herodotus, beginning with Ionia and listing the other satrapies from west to east excluding Persis, which was the land of the Persians and the only province which was not a conquered land. Tributes were paid in both silver and gold talents. Tributes in silver from each satrap were measured with the Babylonian talent. Those paid in gold were measured with the Euboic talent. The total tribute from the satraps came to an amount less than 15,000 silver talents.\nThe majority of the satraps were of Persian origin and were members of the royal house or the six great noble families. These satraps were personally picked by Darius to monitor these provinces. Each of the provinces was divided into sub-provinces, each having its own governor, who was chosen either by the royal court or by the satrap. To assess tributes, a commission evaluated the expenses and revenues of each satrap. To ensure that one person did not gain too much power, each satrap had a secretary, who observed the affairs of the state and communicated with Darius; a treasurer, who safeguarded provincial revenues; and a garrison commander, who was responsible for the troops. Additionally, royal inspectors, who were the \"eyes and ears\" of Darius, completed further checks on each satrap.\nThe imperial administration was coordinated by the chancery with headquarters at Persepolis, Susa, and Babylon with Bactria, Ecbatana, Sardis, Dascylium and Memphis having branches. Darius kept Aramaic as the common language, which soon spread throughout the empire. However, Darius gathered a group of scholars to create a separate language system only used for Persis and the Persians, which was called Aryan script and was only used for official inscriptions. Before this, the accomplishments of the king were addressed in Persian solely through narration and hymns and through the \"masters of memory\". Indeed, oral history continued to play an important role throughout the history of Iran.\nEconomy.\nDarius introduced a new universal currency, the daric, sometime before 500 BCE. Prior to its introduction payments had been in barter or used coins issued by Lydia or other Ionian cities. Darius used the coinage system as a transnational currency to regulate trade and commerce throughout his empire. The Daric was also recognized beyond the borders of the empire, in places such as Celtic Central Europe and Eastern Europe. There were two types of darics, a gold daric and a silver daric. Only the king could mint gold darics. Important generals and satraps minted silver darics, the latter usually to recruit Greek mercenaries in Anatolia. The daric was a major boost to international trade. Trade goods such as textiles, carpets, tools and metal objects began to travel throughout Asia, Europe and Africa.\nThe daric also improved government revenues as the introduction of the daric made it easier to collect new taxes on land, livestock and marketplaces. This led to the registration of land which was measured and then taxed. The increased government revenues helped maintain and improve existing infrastructure and helped fund irrigation projects in dry lands. This new tax system also led to the formation of state banking and the creation of banking firms. One of the most famous banking firms was Murashu Sons, based in the Babylonian city of Nippur. These banking firms provided loans and credit to clients.\nIn an effort to further improve trade, Darius built canals, underground waterways and a powerful navy. According to Herodotus, qanat irrigation technology was introduced to Egypt, which is supported by the historian Albert T. Olmstead. He further improved and expanded the network of roads and way stations throughout the empire, so that there was a system of travel authorization for the King, satraps and other high officials, which entitled the traveller to draw provisions at daily stopping places.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"By the grace of Ahuramazda am I king; Ahuramazda has granted me the kingdom.\"&lt;br&gt;\u2014 Darius, on the Behistun Inscription\nWhile there is no general consensus in scholarship whether Darius and his predecessors had been influenced by Zoroastrianism, it is well established that Darius was a firm believer in Ahura Mazda, whom he saw as the supreme deity. However, Ahura Mazda was also worshipped by adherents of the Indo-Iranian religious tradition. As can be seen at the Behistun Inscription, Darius believed that Ahura Mazda had appointed him to rule the Achaemenid Empire.\nDarius had dualistic philosophical convictions and believed that each rebellion in his kingdom was the work of druj, the enemy of Asha. Darius believed that because he lived righteously by Asha, Ahura Mazda supported him. In many cuneiform inscriptions denoting his achievements, he presents himself as a devout believer, perhaps even convinced that he had a divine right to rule over the world. In one inscription he writes \"Ahura Mazda is mine, I am Ahura Mazda's\".\nIn the lands that were conquered by his empire, Darius followed the same Achaemenid tolerance that Cyrus had shown and later Achaemenid kings would show. He supported faiths and religions that were \"alien\" as long as the adherents were \"submissive and peaceable\", sometimes giving them grants from his treasury for their purposes. He had funded the restoration of the Israelite temple which had originally been decreed by Cyrus, was supportive towards Greek cults which can be seen in his letter to Gadatas, and supported Elamite priests. He had also observed Egyptian religious rites related to kingship and had built the temple for the Egyptian god, Amun.\nBuilding projects.\nEarly on, Darius and his advisors had the idea to establish new royal mansions at Susa and Persepolis because he was eager to demonstrate his newfound power and leave a lasting legacy. Since Cyrus's conquest, Susa's urban layout had remained unchanged, maintaining the layout from the Elamite era. Only during Darius's rule does the archaeological evidence at Susa start showing any signs of an Achaemenid layout.\nDuring Darius's Greek expedition, he had begun construction projects in Susa, Egypt and Persepolis. The Darius Canal that connected the Nile to the Red Sea was constructed by him. It ran from present-day Zagazig in the eastern Nile Delta through Wadi Tumilat, Lake Timsah, and Great Bitter Lake, which are both close to present-day Suez. To open this canal, he travelled to Egypt in 497 BCE, where the inauguration was carried out with great fanfare and celebration. Darius also built a canal to connect the Red Sea and Mediterranean. On this visit to Egypt he erected monuments and executed Aryandes on the charge of treason. When Darius returned to Persis, he found that the codification of Egyptian law had been finished. Darius improved the Royal Road, turning it into a smooth communication network with lodging services located at regular intervals.\nIn Egypt, Darius built many temples and restored those that had previously been destroyed. Even though Darius was a believer of Ahura Mazda, he built temples dedicated to the Gods of the Ancient Egyptian religion. Several temples found were dedicated to Ptah and Nekhbet. Darius also created several roads and routes in Egypt. The monuments that Darius built were often inscribed in the official languages of the Persian Empire, Old Persian, Elamite and Babylonian and Egyptian hieroglyphs. He also ordered the creation of the Old Persian cuneiform script. To construct these monuments, Darius employed a large number of workers and artisans of diverse nationalities. Several of these workers were deportees who had been employed specifically for these projects. These deportees enhanced the empire's economy and improved inter-cultural relations. At the time of Darius's death construction projects were still under way. Xerxes completed these works and in some cases expanded his father's projects by erecting new buildings of his own.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The victor, Ochus, adopted the name Darius (Greek sources often call him Darius \"Nothos\", \"Bastard\"), in reference to his unattested lineage. His reign was marked by a series of revolts by various satraps and involvement in the Greek Peloponnesian War.\nIt seems that Darius II was quite dependent on his wife Parysatis. In excerpts from Ctesias, some harem intrigues are recorded, in which he played a disreputable part. The Elephantine papyri mention Darius II as a contemporary of the high priest Johanan of Ezra 6:10. Darius II is potentially mentioned in the books of Haggai, Zechariah, and Ezra\u2013Nehemiah of the Hebrew Bible (the Christian Old Testament). There is some debate on whether these books refer to Darius the Great though.\nRise to power.\nTexts from the Babylonian Murashu Archive date the transition from Artaxerxes I to Darius II between December 424 BC and February 423 BC. These Babylonian records do not reference any other contenders for the Persian throne directly, but Classical Greek and Latin historians, primarily Ctesias of Cnidus, describe a struggle for power within the Achamenid royal family. Darius II received his royal name and recognition from supporters in Babylon, while his half-brothers, Xerxes II and Sogdianus, claimed authority elsewhere in the Empire. After just 45 days, Sogdianus orchestrated Xerxes's assassination.\nDarius quickly gathered support from influential figures in the Persian Empire, including Sogdianus\u2019s former cavalry commander, Arbarius, Satrap Arsames of Egypt, the influential Paphlagonian eunuch Artoxares, and possibly Satrap Hydarnes of Armenia. Rather than fighting Sogdianus, Darius and his wife and half-sister, Parysatis, arranged to negotiate. When Sogdianus arrived for negotiations, he was seized and executed in a pit of hot ashes.\nSoon after defeating his half-brothers, Darius\u2019s full brother, Arsites, rebelled for unclear reasons. Arsites was Satrap of Syria and had the support of Artyphius, son of the earlier rebel Satrap Megabyzus. Darius sent an army to confront his brother under the command of Artasyrus, a Bactrian nobleman. The rebels defeated Artasyrus' army in two engagements, but they were defeated in a third. After that defeat, Artasyrus bribed the Greek mercenaries in Arsites's army to surrender and captured Artyphius. Artyphius was temporarily spared on Parysatis\u2019 advice to demonstrate the new regime\u2019s leniency. When Arsites surrendered, he and Artyphius were both executed with hot ashes as well.\nInternal rebellions.\nEarly in Darius\u2019s reign, Pissuthnes, the Satrap of Lydia, also staged a revolt for unknown reasons. Pissuthnes employed the Athenian general Lycon to command Greek mercenaries on his behalf while Darius sent Tissaphernes, a younger son of Hydarnes, to combat the rebellion. Tissaphernes immediately sent a letter to Lycon, offering the Greek mercenaries greater rewards if they turned on Pissouthnes and joined Tissaphernes\u2019 army. The rebellious satrap was forced to negotiate and surrender. Tissaphernes sent him back to Persia to face execution and became the new Satrap of Lydia as a reward.\nPissuthnes' son, Amorges, continued the rebellion with a band of mercenaries funded by Athens in Iasus. Darius may have been hesitant to pursue Amorges in order to avoid conflict with Athens, but after the disastrous Athenian expedition to Sicily, the king ordered Tissaphernes and the neighboring satrap, Pharnabazus II, to defeat the rebels and exact tribute from Athenian-held territory in Asia Minor. Tissaphernes arranged an alliance with Sparta, and the Spartan navy assisted the Persians in defeating Amorges and re-taking Iasus in 412 BC.After Darius took power, he arranged diplomatic marriages between his own family and that of Hydarnes in Armenia. Darius\u2019s eldest son, Arsaces (the future Artaxerxes II), married Hydarnes's daughter, Stateira. Hydarnes\u2019 son, Terituchmes, married Darius\u2019s daughter, Amestris. When Hydarnes died, Terituchmes inherited his position as Satrap of Armenia but came to resent his royal marriage. According to Ctesias, the new Satrap was in love with his own sister, Rhoxane and made plans to murder Amestris and marry Rhoxane instead.\nTerituchmes gathered 300 men to stuff Amestris in a sack and stab her to death. Murdering a member of the royal family was an act of rebellion, but before Darius could mobilize against Armenia, an Armenian nobleman, Udiastes, offered to raise an army and put down the rebellion himself, killing Terituchmes and 37 of his assassins in the resulting battle. Udiastes's own son was one of the rebels and attempted to flee with one of Terituchmes's sons to Zaris, but they were soon captured and executed as well. Armenia was temporarily governed by Artasyrus as a \u201cKing\u2019s Eye,\u201d before passing the province to his son, Orontes I.\nXenophon and Diodorus Siculus reference several other minor revolts in their works, including conflict with the Medes, Cadusians, Pisidians, Arabs, and Egyptians.\nConflict with Athens.\nAs long as the power of Athens remained intact Darius did not meddle in Greek affairs. In 424 or 423 BC, Darius and the Athenian emissary Epilycus confirmed the peace between Persia and Athens, either through a new agreement or a renewal of the Peace of Callias. When in 413 BC, Athens supported the rebel Amorges in Caria, Darius II would not have responded had not the Athenian power been broken in the same year at Syracuse. As a result of that event, Darius II gave orders to his satraps in Asia Minor, Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus, to send in the overdue tribute of the Greek towns and to begin a war with Athens. To support the war with Athens, the Persian satraps entered into an alliance with Sparta. In 408 BC he sent his son Cyrus to Asia Minor, to carry on the war with greater energy.\nDarius II may have expelled various Greek dynasts who had been ruling cities in Ionia: Pausanias wrote that the sons of Themistocles, which include Archeptolis, Governor of Magnesia, \"appear to have returned to Athens\", and that they dedicated a painting of Themistocles in the Parthenon and erected a bronze statue to Artemis Leucophryene, the goddess of Magnesia, on the Acropolis. They may have returned from Asia Minor in old age, after 412 BC, when the Achaemenids took again firm control of the Greek cities of Asia, and they may have been expelled by the Achaemenid satrap Tissaphernes sometime between 412 and 399 BC. In effect, from 414 BC, Darius II had started to resent increasing Athenian power in the Aegean and had Tissaphernes enter into an alliance with Sparta against Athens, which in 412 BC led to the Persian conquest of the greater part of Ionia.\nDarius is said to have received the visit of Greek athlete and Olympic champion Polydamas of Skotoussa, who made a demonstration of his strength by killing three Immortals in front of the Persian ruler. A sculpture representing the scene is visible in the Museum of the History of the Olympic Games of antiquity.Darius II died in 404 BC, in the nineteenth year of his reign, and was followed as Persian king by Artaxerxes II.\nAmestris the wife of Terituchmes\nArtaxerxes II\nCyrus the Younger\nArtostes\nOstanes\nOxathres or Oxendares or Oxendras\nSeven other unnamed children died in childhood\nThe unnamed satrap of Media at 401 B.C.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During his early career, he was reportedly an obscure figure among his peers and first rose to prominence during the Cadusian expedition of Artaxerxes III in the 350s BC. As a reward for his bravery, he was given the Satrapy of Armenia. Around 340 BC, he was placed in charge of the royal \"postal service,\" a high-ranking position. In 338 BC, Artaxerxes III met an abrupt end after being poisoned by the court eunuch and chiliarch (\"hazahrapatish\") Bagoas, who installed Artaxerxes' youngest son Arses on the throne. He only reigned for a few years, until Bagoas had him poisoned as well. Darius was subsequently installed on the throne and soon forced Bagoas to drink his poison after discovering that the eunuch had planned to poison him as well.\nIn 334\u00a0BC, Alexander the Great began his invasion of the Persian Empire and subsequently defeated the Persians in several battles before looting and destroying their capital, Persepolis, by fire in 330\u00a0BC. With the Persian Empire now effectively under Alexander's control, Alexander then decided to pursue Darius. Before Alexander reached him, however, Darius was killed by his relative Bessus, who was also the satrap of Bactria.\nName.\nBefore his accession, Darius bore the name of Artashata (Old Persian: \"*Arta\u0161iy\u0101ta\", \"Happy in Arta\"). The 2nd-century Roman historian Justin is the only historian to refer Darius as Codomannus, a name he supposedly bore before he rose to prominence. It may have been his nickname, or possibly a third name. Its etymology is uncertain. Badian has suggested that the name was of Western Semitic origin, most likely from the Aramaic \"qdmwn\" (\"from the East, Easterner\"). Having two names was not unusual; there are several recorded instances of Babylonian figures having two names, often a Babylonian and Aramaic name. One Persian magnate is also attested with a Babylonian and Iranian name. However, this practice seems to have fallen out of favour during Darius's lifetime. Badian suggests that his birth name was the Aramaic Codomannus, which he later dropped in favour of Artashata when he rose in ranks. He first adopted the regnal name of Darius (Old Persian: \"Daraya-vahau\u0161\", \"he who holds firm the good(ness)\") when he ascended the Achaemenid throne in 336 BC.\nHistoriography.\nThe last century of the Achaemenid era is notable for lacking in sources, especially during the reign of Darius III. He is not attested in any Persian sources and is almost completely only known from the reports of Greek historians, who portray his career as a contradiction to that of the successful Alexander the Great.\nBackground.\nDarius was born in c.\u2009380 BC. He was a distant member of the royal Achaemenid dynasty. He was the son of a certain Arsames, and grandson of Ostanes, whose father Darius II ruled the Achaemenid Empire from 424 BC to 405 BC. His mother was Sisygambis, a woman of obscure origins. She was probably of Achaemenid descent, although it is unknown to which branch she belonged. She may have been the daughter of Ostanes, and thus the sister of Arsames. Darius had a brother and sister; Oxyathres and Stateira I, respectively.\nEarly life.\nArtashata is first attested during the Cadusian expedition of Artaxerxes III (r.\u2009358\u00a0\u2013\u00a0338\u00a0BC) in the 350s BC. During a battle, Artashata distinguished himself by slaying a warrior in single combat. His exploit was noticed by Artaxerxes III, who sent him gifts and gave him the Satrapy of Armenia. It was probably after this promotion that Artashata married for the first time, to an unknown noblewoman, who bore him two daughters, and possibly a son named Ariobarzanes. His first marriage has suggested being the \"terminus ad quem\" for when he dropped his Aramaic name, Codomannus. Greek writers report that Artashata later became the \"courier\" and \"slave\" of the king, which some modern historians believe was written to belittle Artashata. However, the terms are in reality a Greek translation of the Old Persian \"bandaka\", which did not mean slave, but \"henchman, (loyal) servant, vassal.\"\nOn the Behistun inscription, Darius the Great (r.\u2009522\u00a0\u2013\u00a0486\u00a0BC) uses the term to refer to his high-ranking officers. It has been deduced that Artashata was probably in charge of the royal \"postal service,\" a high-ranking position. He may have held the same Persepolis sector headed by the prominent Persian officer Pharnaces (d. 497 BC). It is uncertain when this happened, it has been suggested this promotion took place around 340 BC, when Artashata married for a second time, with his sister Stateira I. In 339 BC, they had a son named Ochus. This demonstrates that Artaxerxes III, who was highly alert on any possible relative to challenge the throne, did not consider Artashata to pose the slightest threat to him or his son Arses.\nIn late August/late September 338 BC, the court eunuch and chiliarch (\"hazahrapatish\") Bagoas instigated the murder of Artaxerxes III, and of all the king's sons except for Arses and Bisthanes. Artaxerxes III's early death proved to be a problematic issue for Persia. Several modern historians argue that it paved the way for the fall of the Achaemenid Empire. Bagoas, acting as kingmaker, put the young Arses (Artaxerxes IV) on the throne. Arses was determined on trying to free himself from Bagoas' authority and influence; he made an unsuccessful effort to have the latter poisoned, only to be poisoned himself along with the rest of his family by Bagoas, who put Artashata on the throne in 336 BC. Darius III's reputation for bravery, his probable royal descent, and the support he enjoyed from Artaxerxes III all helped him gain acceptance amongst the aristocracy. Macedonian propaganda, made to legitimize the conquests of Alexander the Great a few years later, accused Darius III of playing a key role in the murder of Arses, who was portrayed as the last king of the Achaemenid royal house.\nConflict with the Greeks.\nPhilip's campaign.\nBagoas soon attempted to poison Darius III as well, but his plans were discovered. Darius III summoned Bagoas and asked him to drink a toast for him, giving him his cup which was filled with poison. Bagoas was forced to drink the cup, resulting in his death. This happened around the time of Alexander's accession to the Macedonian throne in the autumn of 336 BC. At the start of Darius III's reign, Egypt and Babylon may have briefly been plunged into rebellion. Regardless, they were seemingly not of heavy significance, as reports about the events quickly disappear.\nIn 336 BC Philip II of Macedon was authorized by the League of Corinth as its Hegemon to initiate a sacred war of vengeance against the Persians for desecrating and burning the Athenian temples during the Second Persian War, over a century before. He sent an advance force into Asia Minor under the command of his generals Parmenion and Attalus to liberate the Greeks living under Persian control. After they took the Greek cities of Asia from Troy to the Maiandros river, Philip was assassinated and his campaign was suspended while his heir consolidated his control of Macedonia and the rest of Greece.\nAlexander's campaign.\nIn the spring of 334 BC, Philip's heir, Alexander, who had himself been confirmed as Hegemon by the League of Corinth, invaded Asia Minor at the head of an army of Macedonian and other Greek soldiers. This invasion, which marked the beginning of the Wars of Alexander the Great, was followed almost immediately by the victory of Alexander over the Persians at Battle of the Granicus. Darius never showed up for the battle, because there was no reason for him to suppose that Alexander intended to conquer the whole of Asia, and Darius may well have supposed that the satraps of the 'lower' satrapies could deal with the crisis, so he instead decided to remain at home in Persepolis and let his satraps handle it. In the previous invasion of Asia Minor by the Spartan king Agesilaus II, the Persians had pinned him in Asia Minor while fomenting rebellion in Greece. Darius attempted to employ the same strategy, with the Spartans rebelling against the Macedonians, but the Spartans were defeated at Megalopolis.\nDarius did not take the field against Alexander's army until a year and a half after Granicus, at the Battle of Issus in 333\u00a0BC. His forces outnumbered Alexander's soldiers by at least a 2 to\u00a01 ratio, but Darius was still outflanked, defeated, and forced to flee. It is told by Arrian that at the Battle of Issus the moment the Persian left went to pieces under Alexander's attack and Darius, in his war-chariot, saw that it was cut off, he incontinently fled \u2013 indeed, he led the race for safety. On the way, he left behind his chariot, his bow, and his royal mantle, all of which were later picked up by Alexander. Greek sources such as Diodorus Siculus' \"Library of History\" and Justin's \"Epitoma Historiarum Philippicarum\" recount that Darius fled out of fear at the Battle of Issus and again two years later at the Battle of Gaugamela despite commanding a larger force in a defensive position each time. At the Battle of Issus, Darius III even caught Alexander by surprise and failed to defeat Alexander's forces. Darius fled so far so fast that Alexander was able to capture Darius's headquarters and take Darius's family as prisoners in the process. Darius petitioned to Alexander through letters several times to get his family back, but Alexander refused to do so unless Darius would acknowledge him as the new emperor of Persia.\nCircumstances were more in Darius's favor at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331\u00a0BC. He had a good number of troops who had been organized on the battlefield properly, he had the support of the armies of several of his satraps, and the ground on the battlefield was almost perfectly even, so as not to impede movement of his scythed chariots. Despite all these beneficial factors, he still fled the battle before any victor had been decided and deserted his experienced commanders as well as one of the largest armies ever assembled. Another source accounts that when Darius perceived the fierce attack of Alexander, as at Issus he turned his chariot around, and was the first to flee, once again abandoning all of his soldiers and his property to be taken by Alexander. Many Persian soldiers died that day, so many in fact that after the battle the casualties of his forces ensured that Darius would never again raise an imperial army. Darius then fled to Ecbatana and attempted to raise a third army, while Alexander took possession of Babylon, Susa, and the Persian capital at Persepolis. Darius reportedly offered all of his empire west of the Euphrates River to Alexander in exchange for peace several times, each time denied by Alexander against the advice of his senior commanders. Alexander could have declared victory after the capture of Persepolis, but he instead decided to pursue Darius.\nThe Battle of Gaugamela, in which Alexander the Great defeated Darius III of Persia in 331 BC, took place approximately 100 kilometres (62\u00a0mi) west of Erbil, Iraq. After the battle, Darius managed to flee to the city. However, somewhat inaccurately, the confrontation is sometimes known as the \"Battle of Arbela.\"\nFlight, imprisonment, and death.\nDarius attempted to restore his once-great army after his defeat at the hands of Alexander, but he failed to raise a force comparable to that which had fought at Gaugamela, partly because the defeat had undermined his authority, and also because Alexander's liberal policy, for instance in Babylonia and Persis, offered an acceptable alternative to Persian policies.\nWhen at Ecbatana, Darius learned of Alexander's approaching army, he decided to retreat to Bactria where he could better use his cavalry and mercenary forces on the more even ground of the plains of Asia. He led his army through the Caspian Gates, the main road through the mountains that would work to slow the following army. Persian forces became increasingly demoralized with the constant threat of a surprise attack from Alexander, leading to many desertions and eventually a coup led by Bessus, a satrap, and Nabarzanes, who managed all audiences with the King and was in charge of the palace guard. The two men suggested to Darius that the army regroup under Bessus and that power would be transferred back to the King once Alexander was defeated. Darius did not accept this plan and his conspirators became more anxious to remove him for his successive failures against Alexander and his forces. Patron, a Greek mercenary, encouraged Darius to accept a bodyguard of Greek mercenaries rather than his usual Persian guard to protect him from Bessus and Nabarzanes, but the King could not accept for political reasons and grew accustomed to his fate. Bessus and Nabarzanes eventually bound Darius and threw him in an ox-cart while they ordered the Persian forces to continue. According to Curtius' \"History of Alexander\", at this point Alexander and a small, mobile force arrived and threw the Persians into a panic, leading Bessus and two other conspirators, Satibarzanes and Barsaentes, to wound the king with their javelins and leave him to die.\nA Macedonian soldier found Darius either dead or dying in the wagon shortly thereafter\u2014a disappointment to Alexander, who wanted to capture Darius alive. Alexander saw Darius' dead body in the wagon and took the signet ring off the dead king's finger. Afterwards, he sent Darius's body back to Persepolis, gave him a magnificent funeral and ordered that he be buried, like all his royal predecessors, in the royal tombs. Darius's tomb has not yet been discovered. Alexander eventually married Darius's daughter Stateira at Susa in 324\u00a0BC.\nWith the old king defeated and given a proper burial, Alexander's rulership of Persia became official. This led to Darius being regarded by some historians as cowardly and inefficient, as under his rulership, the entirety of the Persian Empire fell to a foreign invader. After killing Darius, Bessus took the regal name Artaxerxes V and began calling himself the King of Asia. He was subsequently captured by Alexander, tortured, and executed. Another of Darius's generals ingratiated himself to Alexander by giving the conqueror Darius's favored companion, Bagoas.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In matrix theory he is visible today in having his name on the Smith normal form of a matrix. Smith was also first to discover the Cantor set.\nLife.\nSmith was born in Dublin, Ireland, the fourth child of John Smith (1792\u20131828), a barrister, who died when Henry was two. His mother, Mary Murphy (d.1857) from Bantry Bay, very soon afterwards moved the family to England. He had thirteen siblings, including Eleanor Smith, who became a prominent educational activist. He lived in several places in England as a boy. His mother did not send him to school but educated him herself until age 11, at which point she hired private tutors. At age 15 Smith was admitted in 1841 to Rugby School in Warwickshire, where Thomas Arnold was the school's headmaster. This came about because his tutor Henry Highton took up a housemaster position there.\nAt 19 he won an entrance scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford. He graduated in 1849 with high honours in both mathematics and classics. Smith was fluent in French having spent holidays in France, and he took classes in mathematics at the Sorbonne in Paris during the 1846\u20137 academic year. He was unmarried and lived with his mother until her death in 1857. He then brought his sister, Eleanor Smith, to live with him as housekeeper at St Giles.\nSmith remained at Balliol College as a mathematics tutor following his graduation in 1849 and was soon promoted to Fellow status.\nIn 1861, he was promoted to the Savilian Chair of Geometry at Oxford. In 1873, he was made the beneficiary of a fellowship at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and gave up teaching at Balliol.\nIn 1874 he became Keeper of the University Museum and moved (with his sister) to the Keeper's House on South Parks Road in Oxford.\nOn account of his ability as a man of affairs, Smith was in demand for academic administrative and committee work: he was Keeper of the Oxford University Museum; a Mathematical Examiner for the University of London; a member of a Royal Commission to review scientific education practice; a member of the commission to reform University of Oxford governance; chairman of the committee of scientists overseeing the Meteorological Office; twice president of the London Mathematical Society; etc.\nHe died in Oxford on 9 February 1883. He is buried in St Sepulchre's Cemetery in Oxford.\nWork.\nResearches in number theory.\n\"An overview of Smith's mathematics contained in a lengthy obituary published in a professional journal in 1884 is reproduced at NumberTheory.Org. The following is an extract from it.\"\nSmith's two earliest mathematical papers were on geometrical subjects, but the third concerned the theory of numbers. Following the example of Gauss, he wrote his first paper on the theory of numbers in Latin: \"De compositione numerorum primorum form\u00e6 formula_1 ex duobus quadratis.\" In it he proves in an original manner the theorem of Fermat---\"That every prime number of the form formula_1 (formula_3 being an integer) is the sum of two square numbers.\" In his second paper he gives an introduction to the theory of numbers.\nIn 1858, Smith was selected by the British Association to prepare a report upon the Theory of Numbers. It was prepared in five parts, extending over the years 1859\u20131865. It is neither a history nor a treatise, but something intermediate. The author analyzes with remarkable clearness and order the works of mathematicians for the preceding century upon the theory of congruences, and upon that of binary quadratic forms. He returns to the original sources, indicates the principle and sketches the course of the demonstrations, and states the result, often adding something of his own.\nDuring the preparation of the Report, and as a logical consequence of the researches connected therewith, Smith published several original contributions to the higher arithmetic. Some were in complete form and appeared in the \"Philosophical Transactions\" of the Royal Society of London; others were incomplete, giving only the results without the extended demonstrations, and appeared in the Proceedings of that Society. One of the latter, entitled \"On the orders and genera of quadratic forms containing more than three indeterminates,\" enunciates certain general principles by means of which he solves a problem proposed by Eisenstein, namely, the decomposition of integer numbers into the sum of five squares; and further, the analogous problem for seven squares. It was also indicated that the four, six, and eight-square theorems of Jacobi, Eisenstein and Liouville were deducible from the principles set forth.\nIn 1868, Smith returned to the geometrical researches which had first occupied his attention. For a memoir on \"Certain cubic and biquadratic problems\" the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin awarded him the Steiner prize.\nIn February, 1882, Smith was surprised to see in the \"Comptes rendus\" that the subject proposed by the Paris Academy of Science\nfor the \"Grand prix des sciences math\u00e9matiques\" was the theory of the decomposition of integer numbers into a sum of five squares; and that the attention of competitors was directed to the results announced without demonstration by Eisenstein, whereas nothing was said about his papers dealing with the same subject in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. He wrote to M. Hermite calling his attention to what he had published; in reply he was assured that the members of the commission did not know of the existence of his papers, and he was advised to complete his demonstrations and submit the memoir according to the rules of the competition. According to the rules each manuscript bears a motto, and the corresponding envelope containing the name of the successful author is opened. There were still three months before the closing of the \"concours\" (1 June 1882) and Smith set to work, prepared the memoir and despatched it in time.\nTwo months after Smith's death, the Paris Academy made their award. Two of the three memoirs sent in were judged worthy of the prize. When\nthe envelopes were opened, the authors were found to be Smith and Minkowski, a young mathematician of K\u00f6nigsberg, Prussia. No notice was taken of Smith's previous publication on the subject, and M. Hermite on being written to, said that he forgot to bring the matter to the notice of the commission.\nWork on the Riemann integral.\nIn 1875 Smith published the important paper on the integrability of discontinuous functions in Riemann's sense. In this work, while giving a rigorous definition of the Riemann integral as well as explicit rigorous proofs of many of the results published by Riemann, he also gave an example of a meagre set which is not negligible in the sense of measure theory, since its measure is not zero: a function which is everywhere continuous except on this set is not Riemann integrable. Smith's example shows that the proof of sufficient condition for the Riemann integrability of a discontinuous function given earlier by Hermann Hankel was incorrect and the result does not hold: however, his result remained unnoticed until much later, having no influence on successive developments. In an 1875 paper, he discussed a nowhere-dense set of positive measure on the real line, an early version of the Cantor set, now known as the Smith\u2013Volterra\u2013Cantor set.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and the Eton Group. It is Britain's oldest public school and is considered to be the oldest continuously operating school in the world, as education on the Abbey and Cathedral grounds has been uninterrupted since AD 597.\nHistory.\nThe school started as a medieval cathedral school said to have been founded during late antiquity in AD 597, a century after the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, by Augustine of Canterbury, considered the \"Apostle to the English\" and a founder of the English Church, thus making it arguably the world's oldest extant school. This is based on the fact that St Augustine founded an abbey (within the current school's grounds) where it is known that teaching took place.\nWhen the Dissolution of the Monasteries took place, the school was re-founded by royal charter in 1541. A Headmaster, a Lower Master, and fifty King's Scholars were established and the name \"King's School\" was used for the first time, referring to King Henry VIII. Cardinal Pole moved the school to the Mint Yard and acquired the Almonry building, which was in use for over 300 years.\nThroughout the next 100 years several former pupils achieved national recognition helping the school establish its reputation; these include the first headmaster, John Twyne, and Christopher Marlowe, William Harvey and John Tradescant the Younger. The buildings were improved and academic standards raised during the leadership of John Mitchinson and around this time the school became a \"public school\" with a national reputation.\nWhen Canon John \"Fred\" Shirley became headmaster in 1935 the school was suffering from the effects of the depression. He managed the school's rapid expansion to around 600 pupils over the next 30 years, constructing further buildings in the precincts and helping the school survive the war-time evacuation. The school received a new Royal Charter from King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1946. During this time, the reputation of the school grew, helped by its academic and sporting successes.\nThe school was boys-only for almost 1400 years, until the early 1970s, when girls were admitted to the Sixth Form for the first time, and the school has been fully co-educational since 1990. The school is also the oldest charity in the UK.\nAssessment.\nIn 2011, the school was rated as \"Good\" by Ofsted. In 2017, the school was subject to its latest regular, independent inspection. The inspection team praised the \"outstanding academic results\" and the pupils' integrity, self-assurance, and \"generosity of spirit\". According to the \"Good Schools Guide\", the school is \"highly successful, producing excellent results\". The \"Guide\" also stated, \"You need to be creative, academically able and hard-working, as everything moves fast here.\"\nAcademic results.\nIn 2019, 54% of pupils scored A*-A for their A-Levels examination, and in 2022, 72% scored A*-A for their GCSEs.\nHouses.\nThere are 16 houses at King's, 13 boarding and 3 day. Most are named after past headmasters or people of interest in the school's history, with the exception of \"School House\", \"The Grange\" and \"Carlyon\". The Houses of the School are:\nFacilities.\nThe school's Norman staircase is one of the most painted, photographed and admired sites in Canterbury. As its name suggests it dates back to the 12th century. For formal occasions, the School traditionally gathered here. Archbishops of Canterbury addressed the School from the Staircase during Visitations. King George VI, accompanied by Queen Elizabeth and Princess Elizabeth, presented the School's Royal Charter to the Dean on 11 July 1946.\nTraditions.\nKing's has many traditions including:\nKing's Week.\nA festival of arts, held during the last week of the summer term, introduced by Fred Shirley in 1952. The week has featured over 100 events, ranging from classical concerts to theatre performances, held in locations around Canterbury. Events have been free to attend and required no booking and a number were broadcast live.\nThe week has culminated in Commemoration day (known as \"Commem\") on the last day of the school year when the school leavers in 6a wore court dress of white tie and tails, with breeches and black stockings, or their national dress, and the whole school attended a service to commemorate the school benefactors; such benefactors include Mathew Parker, the first Archbishop of Canterbury of Elizabeth I.\nOffice of Fair Trading investigation.\nIn 2005, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) provisionally found that the school exchanged detailed information about prospective fee increases with approximately 50 other prominent UK independent schools, including Eton and Sevenoaks. The OFT stated that \"regular and systematic exchange of confidential information as to intended fee increases was anti-competitive and resulted in parents being charged higher fees than would otherwise have been the case.\"\nStaffing.\nPeter Roberts retired as Headmaster at the close of the Summer Term on Thursday, 7 July 2022. Elizabeth Worthington, Senior Deputy Head, was the interim head until September 2023 when Jude Lowson became the first female Head in the history of the School.\nThe Junior King's School, Canterbury.\nThe King's School has a feeder preparatory school, the Junior King's School (JKS), previously Milner Court Preparatory School. The school is a coeducational boarding and day establishment and currently has around 400 pupils aged 3 to 13. Whilst there are boarding facilities available, the majority are day pupils. JKS is now located at Milner Court in Sturry, having been originally based in the crypt of Canterbury Cathedral.\nThe current site was donated by Lady Milner following the death of Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner in 1925. The buildings on site were opened by Rudyard Kipling in 1929, in his capacity as a close friend of Alfred Milner.

Originating among German Lutherans, the \"Easter Hare\" originally played the role of a judge, evaluating whether children were good or disobedient in behavior at the start of the season of Eastertide, similar to the \"naughty or nice\" list made by Santa Claus. As part of the legend, the creature carries colored eggs in its basket, as well as candy, and sometimes toys, to the homes of children. As such, the Easter Bunny again shows similarities to Santa (or the Christkind) and Christmas by bringing gifts to children on the night before a holiday. The custom was first mentioned in Georg Franck von Franckenau's \"De ovis paschalibus\" (\"About Easter Eggs\") in 1682, referring to a German folk belief of an Easter Hare laying eggs hidden in garden and bushes for children to find.\nSymbols.\nRabbits and hares.\nThe hare was a popular motif in medieval church art. In ancient times, it was widely believed (as by Pliny, Plutarch, Philostratus, and Aelian) that the hare was a hermaphrodite. The idea that a hare could reproduce without loss of virginity led to an association with the Virgin Mary, with hares sometimes occurring in illuminated manuscripts and Northern European paintings of the Virgin and Christ Child. It may also have been associated with the Holy Trinity, as in the three hares motif.\nEggs.\nIn Christianity, for the celebration of Eastertide, Easter eggs symbolize the tomb of Jesus, from which Jesus was resurrected. Eggs became associated with Easter specifically when eating them was prohibited during the fast of Lent, when believers abstained from meat and animal products\u2014a practice that continues in certain Christian denominations today, such as the Coptic Orthodox Church, and among Western Christians observing the Daniel Fast. A common practice in England during the medieval Christian era was for children to go door-to-door begging for eggs on the Saturday before Lent began. People handed out eggs as special treats for children to enjoy prior to the Lenten fast; people then abstained from eggs throughout Lent and could enjoy them once again with the conclusion of Lent at the arrival of Easter Sunday. As a special dish, eggs have been decorated by Christians as part of the Easter celebrations. Eggs boiled with some flowers change their color, bringing the spring into the homes, and some over time added the custom of decorating the eggs. Many Christians of the Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodox Church to this day typically dye their Easter eggs red \"in memory of the blood of Christ, shed as at that time of his crucifixion.\" The Ukrainian art of decorating eggs, known as \"pysanky\". Similar variants of this form of artwork are seen among other eastern and central European cultures.\nThe idea of an egg-giving hare went to the U.S. in the 18th century. Protestant German immigrants in the Pennsylvania Dutch area told their children about the \"\"Osterhase\"\" (sometimes spelled \"\"Oschter Haws\"\"). \"Hase\" means \"hare\", not rabbit, and in Northwest European folklore the \"Easter Bunny\" indeed is a hare. According to the legend, only good children received gifts of colored eggs in the nests that they made in their caps and bonnets before Easter.\nHistory.\nHistorical evidence.\nThe earliest attested reference to the Easter Hare (\"Osterhase\") appears in 1678, recorded in \"De ovis paschalibus\" ('About Easter Eggs') by the physician Georg Franck von Franckenau in south-west Germany. The tradition, however, remained largely unknown in other German regions until the 18th century. According to scholar Richard Sermon, hares were a common sight in gardens during the spring and may have provided a convenient explanation for the coloured eggs that were hidden there for children. Alternatively, he notes, a long-standing European belief held that hares laid eggs, likely arising from the similarity between a hare\u2019s form or resting place and the nest of a lapwing, both of which are found in grassland and appear in spring. During the 19th century, the growing influence of Easter-themed cards, toys, and books helped popularize the Easter Hare or Rabbit across Europe. German immigrants subsequently carried the custom to Britain and America, where it developed into the Easter Bunny.\nAlleged association with \u0112ostre.\nIn a publication from 1874 German philologist Adolf Holtzmann stated \"The Easter Hare is unintelligible to me, but probably the hare was the sacred animal of Ostara\". The connection between Easter and that goddess had been made by Jacob Grimm in his 1835 \"Deutsche Mythologie\". This proposed association was repeated by other authors including Charles Isaac Elton and Charles J. Billson. In 1961 Christina Hole wrote, \"The [hare] is the true Easter beast, for he was once sacred to the European Spring-Goddess whom we have already met under her Anglo-Saxon name of \u0112ostre.\" The belief that \u0112ostre had a hare companion who became the Easter Bunny was popularized when it was presented as fact in the BBC documentary \"Shadow of the Hare\" (1993).\nThe Oxford \"Dictionary of English Folklore\" however states \"nowadays, many writers claim that hares were sacred to the Anglo-Saxon goddess \u0112ostre, but there is no shred of evidence for this; Bede, the only writer to mention \u0112ostre, does not link her with any animal\".\nA legend often encountered in contemporary times is that Eostre freed a frozen bird from a tree branch by turning it into a hare. It still continued to lay eggs but, having no use for them anymore and in gratitude to the goddess, gave them away. This has no basis in any authentic, pre-Christian folklore, myth or religion and only appears to date from 1883, first published by K. A. Oberle in a book in German and later quoted by H. Krebs in a notes section in the journal \"Folk-Lore\", also in 1883. His quote is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Some time ago the question was raised how it came that, according to South German still prevailing folk-lore, the Hare is believed by children to lay the Easter-eggs. I venture now to offer a probable answer to it. Originally the hare seems to have been a bird which the ancient Teutonic goddess Ostara (the Anglo-Saxon E\u00e0stre or Eostre, as Bede calls her) transformed into a quadruped. For this reason the Hare, in grateful recollection of its former quality as bird and swift messenger of the Spring-Goddess, is able to lay eggs on her festival at Easter-time.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Formed in 1978, they broke up in 1984, reunited in 2000, and remained sporadically active from then until 2021, when their frontman, Henny Vrienten, died. Throughout their career, the band released five studio albums, four live albums, ten compilations, and numerous singles.\nHistory.\nFormation, first albums, and breaktrough.\nDoe Maar was formed in 1978 by keyboardist and vocalist Ernst Jansz, bassist Piet Dekker (they had previously played in several projects together, including Boudewijn de Groot's backing band), guitarist Jan Hendriks, and drummer Carel Copier. They released their debut, self-titled album a year later, and Dekker departed in 1980.\nAt the end of their first tour, Jansz invited Henny Vrienten, a professional musician and composer, to join the band as their bassist. They began work on the group's second album, \"Skunk\", which was released in March 1981.\nIn 1982, Carel Copier suffered a career-ending injury, forcing him to depart the band. Ren\u00e9 van Collem was recruited in time to record Doe Maar's third album, \"Doris Day en andere Stukken\", whose title track, \"Doris Day\", proved a hit. The album was a success and gained the band prominence among Dutch audiences. A dub version of the record, titled \"Doe De Dub\", mixed by Vrienten and producer Peter Vincent, came out the same year, and the band won a Zilveren Harp award from Buma Cultuur. In May 1982, they were the opening act at Pinkpop. Van Collem left shortly after (he joined Spargo the following year) and was replaced by Jan Pijnenburg.\n\"4us\", touring, and breakup.\nIn March 1983, Doe Maar issued their fourth album, titled \"4us\" (a creative spelling of \"virus\"). In September, the band embarked on their first tour of Belgium. They also released their first live album, titled \"Lijf aan lijf\".\nJansz published his debut novel, \"Gideon's droom\", while Vrienten recorded his first Dutch-language solo album, \"Geen ballade\", having previously released the English-language record \"Paul Santos\", in 1977. The last track on \"Geen ballade\", the instrumental \"Amstel Hotel 13:00\", features all Doe Maar members playing their instruments.\nIn February 1984, Doe Maar went into the studio to record their fifth album. However, they made little headway, and after releasing the single \"Macho\", they decided to split up. The band played two farewell concerts at Maaspoort in Den Bosch, the recordings of which were released in 1995. They also released their first compilation album, titled \"5 Jaar \u2013 Het complete overzicht\", which included two new tracks. In the following years, the band played several reunion shows and released five more compilations.\nReunions, new music, and Vrienten's death.\nIn November 1999, Doe Maar announced a one-time reunion. In February 2000, they issued two singles on the same day: Vrienten's \"Als niet als\", featuring rapper Brainpower, and Jansz' \"Watje\". In April, a new album from the band came out, titled \"Klaar\". They played several concerts at Rotterdam Ahoy, a recording of which was released the same year, under the title \"Hees van Ahoy\".\nIn December 2000, a tribute album, titled \"TriLLend Op M'n Benen (Doe Maar Door Anderen)\", consisting of 14 Doe Maar songs recorded by various artists, was released. Contributors to the record included Bl\u00f8f, Postmen feat. Def Rhymz, Rowwen H\u00e8ze, Skik, Trijntje Oosterhuis, Caesar, the Prodigal Sons, Grof Geschut, Daryll-Ann, Abel, Heideroosjes, Marcel de Groot, Bob Fosko, and Osdorp Posse.\nAt the end of October 2005, reports appeared in the media that Doe Maar was working with V&amp;V Entertainment on a musical theatre production set to their music. \"Doe Maar!\", subtitled \"De popmusical\", premiered in Tilburg on 28 January 2007 and was attended by the full band. It was nominated for five John Kraaijkamp Music Awards and won four, including best male lead (Dani\u00ebl Boissevain), best male supporting role (Jan Elbertse), best female supporting role (Annick Boer), as well as the audience award. Written by Pieter van de Waterbeemd, the production's cast also included Kim-Lian and Jan Rot.\nIn May 2012, Vrienten announced on the television program \"De Wereld Draait Door\" that Doe Maar was working on new material, in collaboration with the record label TopNotch. Released in September of that year, \"Versies/Limmen Tapes\" was a double album that consisted of new versions of the band's classic songs on the first disc, \"Limmen Tapes\", and rap covers of Doe Maar tracks on \"Versies\", produced by the Anonymous Mis, by such artists as Gers Pardoel, Kempi, Kraantje Pappie, the Opposites, Winne, Extince, Postmen, Def Rhymz, and Spinvis.\nLater that year, the band received the Edison Award, and they held a charity concert for War Child.\nIn early 2013, Doe Maar embarked on the Glad ijs tour. Later that year, the television documentary \"Doe Maar: Dit is Alles\" was broadcast. In 2016, they celebrated the 32nd anniversary of their breakup and released a Dutch version of Toots and the Maytals' \"54-46 That's My Number\" with Surinamese reggae singer Kenny B.\nIn 2018, Doe Maar celebrated their 40th anniversary with the club tour Er verandert NIX. In 2021, the band was set to perform at Down the Rabbit Hole, but the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A farewell tour for the group, which was to start at the end of 2021, was also cancelled, owing to Vrienten's illness.\nOn 25 April 2022, Henny Vrienten died of lung cancer, at the age of 73.\nOn 31 May 2024, the band's original drummer, Carel Copier, died of cancer, at the age of 72.\nTrivia.\nDoe Maar have a tile on the Walk of Fame outside GelreDome stadium, in Arnhem, for four sold-out shows of \"Symphonica in Rosso\" they performed there in 2012.\nDiscography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAlbums.\nStudio albums\nLive albums\nCompilations\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther albums\nCompilation appearances\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47127", "revid": "3091149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47127", "title": "Baby boomers", "text": "Cohort born from 1946 to 1964\nBaby boomers, often shortened to boomers, are the demographic cohort preceded by the Silent Generation and followed by Generation X. The generation is often defined as people born from 1946 to 1964 during the mid-20th-century baby boom that followed the end of World War II. The dates, the demographic context, and the cultural identifiers may vary by country. Most boomers are the parents of Generation X and Millennials.\nIn the West, boomers' childhoods in the 1950s and 1960s had significant reforms in education, both as part of the ideological confrontation that was the Cold War, and as a continuation of the interwar period. Theirs was a time of economic prosperity and rapid technological progress, and many grew up expecting the world to improve with time.\nAs this relatively large number of young people entered their teens and young adulthood, they, and those around them, created a very specific rhetoric around their cohort, and social movements brought about by their size in numbers. This impacted society's perception of the boomers and further popularized generational thinking, which was a relatively new phenomenon at the time. In many countries, this period was one of deep political instability due to the postwar youth bulge. In Europe and North America, older boomers came of age during the counterculture of the mid-1960s to early 1970s and its backlash. In the U.S., younger boomers (or Generation Jones) came of age in the \"malaise\" years of the mid-1970s to early 1980s. In China, boomers lived through the Cultural Revolution and were subject to the one-child policy as adults.\nIn the early 21st century, baby boomers in some developed countries are the single biggest cohort in their societies due to sub-replacement fertility and population aging. In the United States, despite their advancing age, they remain the second-largest age demographic after the millennials.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"baby boom\" refers to a noticeable increase in the birth rate. The post-World War II population increase was described as a \"boom\" by various newspaper reporters, including Sylvia F. Porter in a column in the May 4, 1951, edition of the \"New York Post\", based on the increase of 2,357,000 in the population of the U.S. from 1940 to 1950.\nThe first recorded use of \"baby boomer\" is in a January 1963 \"Daily Press\" article by Leslie J. Nason describing a massive surge of college enrollments approaching as the oldest boomers were coming of age. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" dates the modern meaning of the term to a January 23, 1970, article in \"The Washington Post\".\nDate range and definitions.\nA significant degree of consensus exists around the date range of the baby boomer cohort, with the generation considered to cover those born from 1946 to 1964 by various organizations such as the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, Pew Research Center, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Federal Reserve Board, Australian Bureau of Statistics, Gallup, YouGov and Australia's Social Research Center. The United States Census Bureau defines baby boomers as \"individuals born in the United States between mid-1946 and mid-1964\". Landon Jones, in his book \"Great Expectations: America and the Baby Boom Generation\" (1980), defined the span of the baby-boom generation as extending from 1946 through 1964.\nOthers have delimited the baby boom period differently. Authors William Strauss and Neil Howe, in their 1991 book \"Generations\", define the social generation of boomers as that cohort born from 1943 to 1960, who were too young to have any personal memory of World War II, but old enough to remember the postwar American High before John F. Kennedy's assassination.\nDavid Foot, author of \"Boom, Bust and Echo: Profiting from the Demographic Shift in the 21st\u00a0Century\" (1997), defined a Canadian boomer as someone born from 1947 to 1966, the years in which more than 400,000 babies were born. He acknowledges, though, that this is a demographic definition, and that culturally, it may not be as clear-cut. Doug Owram argues that the Canadian boom took place from 1946 to 1962, but that culturally, boomers everywhere were born between the late war years and about 1955 or 1956. Those born in the 1960s might feel disconnected from the cultural identifiers of the earlier boomers.\nFrench politician Mich\u00e8le Delaunay in her book \"Le Fabuleux Destin des Baby-Boomers\" (2019), places the baby-boom generation in France between 1946 and 1973, and in Spain between 1958 and 1975. Another French academic, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Sirinelli, in an earlier study, \"Les Baby-Boomers: Une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration 1945-1969\" (2007) denotes the generation span between 1945 and 1969.\nThe Office for National Statistics has described the UK as having had two baby booms in the middle of the 20th century, one in the years immediately after World War II and one around the 1960s with a noticeably lower birth rate (but still significantly higher than that seen in the 1930s or later in the '70s) during part of the 1950s. Bernard Salt places the Australian baby boom between 1946 and 1961.\nIn the US, the generation can be segmented into two broadly defined cohorts: the \"leading-edge boomers\" (or \"early boomers\") are individuals born between 1946 and 1955, those who came of age during the Vietnam War and Civil Rights eras. This group represents slightly more than half of the generation, or roughly 38,002,000 people. The other half of the generation, usually called \"Generation Jones\" (also called \"late boomers\" or \"trailing-edge boomers\"), was born between 1956 and 1964, and came of age during the Watergate scandal and economic struggles of the 1970s. This second cohort includes about 37,818,000 people. Others use the term Generation Jones to refer to a cusp generation, which includes those born in the latter half of the Baby Boomers to the early years of Generation X, with a typical range of 1954 to 1965.\nDemographics.\nAsia.\n During the time of the Great Leap Forward, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) encouraged couples to have as many children as possible because it believed a growing labor force was needed for national development along socialist lines. China's baby-boom cohort is the largest in the world. According to journalist and photographer Howard French, who spent many years in China, many Chinese neighborhoods were, by the mid-2010s, disproportionately filled with the elderly, to whom the Chinese themselves referred as a \"lost generation\", who grew up during the Cultural Revolution, when higher education was discouraged and large numbers of people were sent to the countryside for political reasons. As China's baby boomers retire in the late-2010s and onward, the people replacing in the workforce will be a much smaller cohort due to the one-child policy. Consequently, China's central government faces a stark economic trade-off between \"cane and butter\"\u2014how much to spend on social welfare programs such as state pensions to support the elderly and how much to spend in the military to achieve the nation's geopolitical objectives.\nAccording to the National Development Council of Taiwan, the nation's population could start shrinking by 2022 and the number of people of working age could fall 10% by 2027. About half of Taiwanese would be aged 50 or over by 2034. At the current rate, Taiwan is set to transition from an aged to super-aged society, where 21% of the population is over 65 years of age, in eight years, compared to seven years for Singapore, eight years for South Korea, 11 years for Japan, 14 for the United States, 29 for France, and 51 for the United Kingdom.\nJapan at present has one of the oldest populations in the world and persistently subreplacement fertility, currently 1.4 per woman. Japan's population peaked in 2017. Forecasts suggest that the elderly will make up 35% of Japan's population by 2040. As of 2018, Japan was already a super-aged society, with 27% of its people being older than 65 years. According to government data, Japan's total fertility rate was 1.43 in 2017. According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Japan has one of the oldest populations in the world, with a median age of 47 years in 2017.\nA baby boom occurred in the aftermath of the Korean War, and the government subsequently encouraged people to have no more than two children per couple. Although South Korean fertility remained above replacement well in to the 1970s, its fertility has since been declining due to declining economic prospects for young people, and women's liberation. In recent times, the South Korean government has since made many efforts to increase the national fertility rate through subsidies; however, these efforts have failed, and South Korea retains one of the world's lowest fertility rates, with a total fertility rate of less than 1 child per woman.\nEurope.\nFrom about 1750 to 1950, Western Europe transitioned from having both high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates. By the late 1960s or 1970s, the average woman had fewer than two children, and although demographers at first expected a \"correction\", such a rebound never came. Despite a bump in the total fertility rates of some European countries in the very late 20th century (the 1980s and 1990s), especially France and Scandinavia, they never returned to replacement level; the bump was largely due to older women realizing their dreams of motherhood. Member states of the European Economic Community saw a steady increase in not just divorce and out-of-wedlock births between 1960 and 1985 but also falling fertility rates. In 1981, a survey of countries across the industrialized world found that while more than half of people aged 65 and over thought that women needed children to be fulfilled, only 35% of those between the ages of 15 and 24 (younger baby boomers and older generation Xers) agreed. Falling fertility was due to urbanization and decreased infant mortality rates, which diminished the benefits and increased the costs of raising children. In other words, investing more in fewer children became more economically sensible, as economist Gary Becker argued. (This is the first demographic transition.) By the 1960s, people began moving from traditional and communal values towards more expressive and individualistic outlooks due to access to and aspiration of higher education, and to the spread of lifestyle values once practiced only by a tiny minority of cultural elites. (This is the second demographic transition.)\nAt the start of the 21st century, Europe has an aging population. This problem is especially acute in Eastern Europe, whereas in Western Europe, it is alleviated by international immigration. Researches by demographers and political scientists Eric Kaufmann, Roger Eatwell, and Matthew Goodwin suggest that such immigration-induced ethnodemographic change is one of the key reasons behind public backlash in the form of national populism across the rich liberal democracies, an example of which is the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum (Brexit).\nIn 2018, 19.70% of the population of the European Union (EU) were 65 or older. The median age was 43 in 2019, and was about 29 in the 1950s. Europe had significant population growth in the late 20th century. However, Europe's growth is projected to halt by the early 2020s due to falling fertility rates and an aging population. In 2015, a woman living in the EU had on average 1.5 children, down from 2.6 in 1960. Although the EU continues to experience a net influx of immigrants, this is not enough to balance out the low fertility rates. In 2017, the median age was 53.1 years in Monaco, 45 in Germany and Italy, and 43 in Greece, Bulgaria, and Portugal, making them some of the oldest countries in the world besides Japan and Bermuda. They are followed by Austria, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, and Spain, whose median age was 43.\nNorth America.\nBy the mid-2010s, sub-replacement fertility and growing life expectancy meant that Canada had an aging population. Statistics Canada reported in 2015 that for the first time in Canadian history, more people were aged 65 and over than people below the age of 15. One in six Canadians was above the age of 65 in July 2015. Projections by Statistics Canada suggest this gap will only increase in the next 40 years. Economist and demographer David Foot from the University of Toronto told CBC that policymakers have ignored this trend for decades. With the massive baby-boom generation entering retirement, economic growth will be slower and demand for social support will rise. This will significantly alter the Canadian economy. Nevertheless, Canada remained the second-youngest G7 nation, as of 2015.\nAmerican parents of the postwar era married earlier and had more children than their predecessors. Pediatrician Benjamin Spock published his \"The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care\" in 1946, just in time of the coming population boom.419 In addition, the ideals of universalism and cosmopolitanism became institutionalized after the Second World War, and ethnic minorities started moving towards institutional parity with the once-dominant Anglo-Protestants. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (also known as the Hart\u2013Celler Act), passed at the urging of President Lyndon B. Johnson, abolished national quotas for immigrants, and replaced it with a system that admits a fixed number of persons per year based in qualities such as skills and the need for refuge. Immigration subsequently surged from elsewhere in North America (especially Canada and Mexico), Asia, Central America, and the West Indies. By the mid-1980s, most immigrants originated from Asia and Latin America. Some were refugees from Vietnam, Cuba, Haiti, and other parts of the Americas, while others came illegally by crossing the long and largely undefended U.S.-Mexican border. Although Congress offered amnesty to \"undocumented immigrants\" who had been in the country for a long time and attempted to penalize employers who recruited them, their influx continued. At the same time, the postwar baby boom and subsequently falling fertility rate seemed to jeopardize America's Social Security system as the baby boomers retire in the early 21st century.\nUsing their own definition of baby boomers as people born between 1946 and 1964 and U.S. census data, the Pew Research Center estimated 71.6 million boomers were in the United States as of 2019. The age wave theory suggests an economic slowdown when the boomers started retiring during 2007\u20132009. In 2018, though, 29% of people aged 65\u201372 in the United States remained active in the labor force, according to the Pew Research Center. This trend follows from the general expectation of Americans to work after the age of 65. The baby boomers who chose to remain in the work force after the age of 65 tended to be university graduates, whites, and residents of the big cities. That the boomers maintained a relatively high labor participation rate made economic sense because the longer they postpone retirement, the more Social Security benefits they could claim, once they finally retire.\nIn childhood and youth.\nStandards of living and economic prospects.\nAfter the Second World War, the United States offered massive financial assistance to Western European nations in the form of the Marshall Plan to rebuild themselves and to extend U.S. economic and political influence. The Soviet Union did the same for Eastern Europe with the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. Western Europe had considerable economic growth, due to both the Marshall Plan and initiatives aimed at European integration, starting with the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community by France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg in 1951 and the European Community in 1957\u201358. As a matter of fact, the Anglo-Americans spoke of the 'Golden Age' and French of '30 glorious years' (\"les trente glorieuses\") continued economic growth. For the United States, the postwar economic expansion was a continuation of what had occurred during the war, but for Western Europe and Japan, the primary economic goal was to return to prewar levels of productivity and prosperity, and many managed to close the gap with the United States in productivity per work hour and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Full employment was reached on both sides of the Atlantic by the 1960s. In Western Europe, the average unemployment figure stood at 1.5% at that time. The automobile, already a common sight in North America, became so in Western Europe, and to a lesser extent, Eastern Europe and Latin America. At the same time, governments around the world undertook the construction or expansion of public transportation networks at a rate never before seen.\nMany items previously deemed luxurious, such as the laundry machine, the dishwasher, the refrigerator, and the telephone, entered mass production for the average consumer. The average person could live like the upper class in the previous generation. Technological advances made before, during, and after the war, such as plastics, television, magnetic tape, transistors, integrated circuits, and lasers, played a key role in the tremendous improvements in the standards of living for the average citizen in the developed world. This was a time of optimism, economic prosperity, and a growing middle class. In some instances, the rate of technological change was so rapid even when compared to optimistic projections, so much so that some social theorists of the day warned of boredom for the housewife. In reality, it paved the way for a more individualistic culture and women's emancipation, something the Baby Boomers would push for when they came of age during the late 1960s and 1970s. It was also one of the reasons why the baby boom lasted for as long as it did; housekeeping and child-rearing became less onerous for women. Nevertheless, after 1945, because child labor had been virtually eradicated in the West, married women from families of modest means had to join the work force. As historians Louise Tilly and Joan Scott explain, \"in the past children had worked so that their mothers could remain at home fulfilling domestic and reproductive responsibilities. Now when families needed additional income, mothers worked instead of children.\"\nDemand for housing exploded. Governments both in the East and the West massively subsidized housing with many public housing projects in urban areas in the form of high-rise apartment buildings. In many cases, this came at the cost of destroying historical sites. The United States saw the beginning of mass suburbanization, a phenomenon not seen in European democracies, as the long commutes were not affordable.223 suburban communities began developing their own entertainment quarters and shopping malls.\nPublic health improved, too, with vaccination programs playing an important role. In the United Kingdom, for example, the introduction of vaccines against poliomyelitis, measles, and pertussis (whooping cough) in the 1950s and 1960s caused infection rates to plummet, albeit with some upticks due to vaccine hesitancy. In the United States, vaccination against measles resulted in not only falling childhood mortality rates but also other positive life outcomes such as rising family income. In the West, average life expectancy increased by about seven years between the 1930s and 1960s. In developed countries, boomers reached puberty at an earlier age than previous generations.\nProsperity was taken for granted. Indeed, for older boomers who came of age in the 1960s, the interwar experience of mass unemployment and stable or falling prices was confined to the history books, and full employment and inflation were the norm. Those with higher standards of living and educational levels were often the most demanding of betterment. The new-found wealth allowed many Western governments to finance generous welfare programs. By the 1970s, all industrialized capitalist nations had become welfare states. Six of them\u2014Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, West Germany, and Italy\u2014spent more than 60% of their national budgets on welfare. When the 'Golden Age' came to an end, such government largess proved problematic.\nThe 'Golden Age' finally petered out in the 1970s, as automation started eating away jobs at the low to medium skill levels, and as younger boomers (Generation Jones) entered the workplace en masse. In the United States, at least, the onset of a recession\u2014as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research\u2014typically occurred within a few years of a peak in the rate of change of the young-adult population, both positive and negative, and indeed, the recession of the mid-1970s took place shortly after older boomers' growth in the late 1960s. Western capitalist nations slid into recessions during the mid-1970s to early 1980s. Although the collective GDP of these nations continued to grow until the early 1990s, so much so that they became much wealthier and more productive by that date, unemployment, especially youth unemployment, exploded in many industrialized countries. In the European Community, the average unemployment rate stood at 9.2% by the late 1980s, despite the deceleration of population growth. Youth unemployment during the 1980s was over 20% in the United Kingdom, more than 40% in Spain, and around 46% in Norway. Generous welfare programs alleviated the potential of social unrest, though Western governments found themselves squeezed by a combination of falling tax revenue and high state spending. Members of the Silent Generation found themselves in an abundance of employment opportunities as they entered the workforce in the 1950s. In fact, they could expect to achieve parity with their fathers' wages at the entrance level. This, however, was not the case for Jonesers. By the mid-1980s, younger boomers could only expect to make a third of what their fathers made as new entrants to the labor force.\nThe pace of economic growth in the 1960s was understood to be unprecedented. In the long-term view, though, it was just another upswing in the Kondratiev cycle (see figure), much like the mid-Victorian boom or the \"Belle \u00c9poque\" from around 1850 to 1873 in Britain and France, respectively. Globally, agricultural output doubled between the early 1950s and early 1980s\u2014more than that in North America, Western Europe, and East Asia\u2014while the fishing industry tripled its catches.Communist nations, especially the Soviet Union and the Eastern European states, grew considerably, too. Heretofore agrarian states such as Bulgaria and Romania began to industrialize. By the 1960s, though, the growth of the communist states faltered compared to the capitalist industrialized countries. By the 1980s, the economies of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe became stagnant. This was, however, not the case in the newly industrializing economies such as China or South Korea, whose process of industrialization began much later, nor was it in Japan.\nThe developing world achieved significant growth during the 1950s and 1960s, though it never quite reached the level of affluence of industrialized societies. The populations of Africa, Asia, and Latin America boomed between 1950 and 1975. Food production comfortably outpaced population growth. As a consequence, this period saw no major famines other than cases due to armed conflict and politics, which did happen in Communist China. People who experienced the Great Famine of China (1958\u20131961) as toddlers were noticeably shorter than those who did not. The Great Famine killed up to 30 million people and massively reduced China's economic output. But before the Famine, China's agricultural output increased 70% from the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 to 1956, according to official statistics. Chairman Mao Zedong introduced a plan for the rapid industrialization of his country, the Great Leap Forward. Steel production, mainly from flimsy household furnaces, tripled between 1958 and 1960, but fell to a level lower than that at the start of the Great Leap Forward by 1962. Rural life\u2014China was a predominantly rural society at this point in history\u2014including family affairs, was collectivized. Women were recruited to the workplace, that is, the fields, while the government provided them with nursery and childcare services. In general, monetary income was replaced by six basic services: food, healthcare, education, haircuts, funerals, and movies. Mao's plan was quickly abandoned, not just because it failed, but also because of the Great Famine. Yet despite the disastrous results of Maoist policies, by the standards of the developing world, China was not doing so poorly. By the mid-1970s, China's food consumption measured in calories was just above the global median and the nation's life expectancy grew steadily, interrupted only by the famine years.\nBetween 1960 and 1975, the Chinese mainland's growth was fast, but lagged behind the growth of Japan and the rise of the Four Asian Tigers (South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore) grew even faster.\nEducation.\nUniversal literacy was a major goal for practically all governments in the developing world and many made significant progress towards this end, even if their 'official' statistics were questionably optimistic. In the 1980s, James R. Flynn examined psychometric data and discovered evidence that the IQ scores of Americans were increasing significantly between the early 1930s and late 1970s. On average, younger cohorts scored higher than their elders. This was confirmed by later studies and on data in other countries; the discovery became known as the Flynn effect. During the postwar era, the importance of modern mathematics\u2014especially mathematical logic, optimization, and numerical analysis\u2014was acknowledged for its usefulness during the war. From this sprang proposals for reforms in mathematics education. The international movement to bring about such reforms was launched in the late 1950s, with heavy French influence. In France, they also grew out of a desire to bring the subject as it was taught in schools closer to the research done by pure mathematicians, particularly the Nicholas Bourbaki school, which emphasized an austere and abstract style of doing mathematics, axiomatization. Up until the 1950s, the purpose of primary education was to prepare students for life and future careers. This changed in the 1960s. A commission headed by Andr\u00e9 Lichnerowicz was established to work out the details of the desired reforms in mathematics education. At the same time, the French government mandated that the same courses be taught to all schoolchildren, regardless of their career prospects and aspirations. Thus the same highly abstract courses in mathematics were taught to not just those willing and able to pursue university studies but also those who left school early to join the workforce. From elementary school to the French Baccalaureate, Euclidean geometry and calculus were de-emphasized in favor of set theory and abstract algebra. This conception of mass public education was inherited from the interwar period and was taken for granted; the model for the elites was to be applied to all segments of society. But by the early 1970s, the Commission ran into problems. Mathematicians, physicists, members of professional societies, economists, and industrial leaders criticized the reforms as being suitable for neither schoolteachers nor students. Many teachers were ill-prepared and ill-equipped. One member of the Lichnerowicz Commission asked, \"Should we teach outdated mathematics to less intelligent children?\" Lichnerowicz resigned and the commission was disbanded in 1973. In the United States, the \"New Math\" initiative\u2014under which students received lessons in set theory, which is what mathematicians actually use to construct the set of real numbers, something advanced undergraduates learned in a course on real analysis, and arithmetic with bases other than ten\u2014was similarly unsuccessful, and was widely criticized by not just parents, but also STEM experts. Nevertheless, the influence of the Bourbaki school in mathematics education lived on, as the Soviet mathematician Vladimir Arnold recalled in a 1995 interview.\nBefore World War II, the share of university-educated people in even the most advanced of industrialized nations, except the United States, a world leader in post-secondary education, was negligible. After the war, the number of university students skyrocketed, not just in the West, but also among developing countries as well. In Europe, between 1960 and 1980, the number of university students increased by a factor of four to five in West Germany, Ireland, and Greece, a factor of five to seven in Finland, Iceland, Sweden and Italy, and a factor of seven to nine in Spain and Norway. In West Germany, the number of university students steadily grew in the 1960s despite the construction of the Berlin Wall, which prevented East German students from coming. By 1966, West Germany had a grand total of 400,000 students, up from 290,000 in 1960. In the Republic of Korea (South Korea), the number of university students as a share of the population grew from around 0.8% to 3% between 1975 and 1983. Families typically considered higher education to be the gateway towards a higher social status and higher income, or, in short, a better life; as such they pushed their children to university whenever possible. In general, the postwar economic expansion made it possible for a larger percentage of the population to send their children to university as full-time students. Moreover, many Western welfare states, starting with U.S. government subsidies to military veterans who wished to attend university, provided financial aid in one form or another to university students, though they were still expected to live frugally. In most countries, with the notable exceptions of Japan and the U.S., universities were more likely to be public rather than private. The total number of universities worldwide more than doubled in the 1970s. The rise of university campuses and university towns was a culturally and politically novel phenomenon, and one that would usher in the political turbulence of the late 1960s around the world.\nAfter World War I, the goal of primary education in the United States shifted from using schools to realize social change to employing them to promote emotional development. While it might have helped students improve their mental welfare, critics pointed to the de-emphasizing of traditional academic subjects leading to poor work habits and plain ignorance. Such a system became less and less tenable because society increasingly demanded rigorous education. In his book \"The American High School Today\" (1959), former Harvard president James B. Conant laid out his critique of the status quo. In particular, he pointed to the failure of English classes in teaching proper grammar and composition, the neglect of foreign languages, and the inability to meet the needs of gifted and slow students alike. People like Conant rose to prominence due to the successful launch of the \"Sputnik\" satellite by the Soviet Union in 1957. As a matter of fact, the passages of the artificial satellite were recorded by the Boston newspapers and viewed with the naked eye from rooftops.\nThis surprising Soviet success demonstrated to the Americans that their education system had fallen behind. \"Life\" magazine reported that three quarters of American high-school students took no physics at all. The U.S. government realized it needed thousands of scientists and engineers to match the might of its ideological rival. On President Dwight D. Eisenhower's direct orders, science education underwent major reforms and the federal government started pouring enormous sums of money into not just education but also research and development. Private institutions, such as the Carnegie Corporation and the Ford Foundation provided funding for education, too. Authors felt inspired to cater to the physics textbook market, and one of the results was the \"Berkeley Physics Course\", a series for undergraduates influenced by MIT's Physical Science Study Committee, formed right before the launch of \"Sputnik\". One of the most famous of textbooks from the \"Berkeley\" series is \"Electricity and Magnetism\" by Nobel laureate Edward Mills Purcell, which has gone through multiple editions and remains in print in the twenty-first century.\nIn any case, academic performance reclaimed its importance in the United States. At the same time, large numbers of young people desired to go to college due to population growth and the needs of society for specialized skills. Prestigious institutions were able to handpick the very best of students from massive pools of applications and consequently became the training centers for a growing class of cognitive elites. Indeed, the share of college graduates among 23-year-olds steadily rose after World War II, first due to veterans returning to civilian life and later due to people born after the war. In 1950, there were 2.6 million students in American institutions of higher learning. By 1970, that number was 8.6 million, and by 1980, it became 12 million. In the 1970s, there was a seemingly infinite number of Baby Boomers applying for admissions at institutions of higher learning in the U.S., so much so that many schools became extremely difficult to get into. This cooled off by the 1980s, though. In the end, about a quarter of Baby Boomers had at least a bachelor's degree. More women earned university degrees than ever before, and became professionals at an unprecedented rate. Because so many Baby Boomers pursued higher education, costs started to rise, making the Silent Generation was the last cohort to benefit from tuition-free public universities anywhere in the United States. The number of women pursuing higher education grew in other countries, too, including those on the other side of the Iron Curtain.\nAmerican physicist Herbert Callen observed that even though a survey conducted by the American Physical Society Committee on the Applications of Physics reported (in the \"Bulletin of the APS\") in 1971 that industry leaders desired a greater emphasis on more practical subjects, such as thermodynamics as opposed to the more abstract statistical mechanics, academia subsequently went the other way. British physicist Paul Dirac, who had relocated to the United States in the 1970s, opined to his colleagues he doubted the wisdom of educating so many undergraduates in science when so many of them had neither the interest nor the aptitude. Having a youth bulge can be seen as one factor among many in explaining social unrest and uprisings in society. Quantitative historian Peter Turchin noted intensifying competition among graduates, whose numbers were larger than what the economy could absorb, a phenomenon he termed elite overproduction, led to political polarization, social fragmentation, and even violence as many became disgruntled with their dim prospects despite having attained a high level of education. Income inequality, stagnating or declining real wages, and growing public debt were contributory factors. Turchin argued that having a youth bulge and massive young population with university degrees were the key reasons for the instability of the 1960s and 1970s and predicted that the 2020s would see the pattern repeat itself.\nBecause the baby boomers were a huge demographic cohort, when they entered the workforce they took up all the jobs they could find, including those below their skill levels. As a result, wages were depressed and many households needed two streams of income in order to pay their bills.\nIn China, even though the Central Government made plans for increasing the people's access to education, school attendance, including at the elementary level, dropped by 25 million due to the Great Famine, and another fifteen million due to the Cultural Revolution. Yet despite all this, by the mid-1970s almost all Chinese children went to elementary school (96%), up six times from the early 1950s. Although Chinese figures for the people deemed illiterate or semi-literate appeared high\u2014a quarter of Chinese over twelve years of age fell into these categories in 1984\u2014the peculiarities of the Chinese language made direct comparisons with other countries difficult.\nIgnoring the skepticism of his comrades, Chairman Mao introduced the Hundred Flowers Campaign of 1956-57 encouraging intellectuals and elites from the old era to share their thoughts freely with the slogan, \"Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred school of thoughts contend\". Mao thought that his revolution had already transformed Chinese society for good. The result was an outburst of ideas deemed unacceptable by the CCP and above all, Mao himself, which fueled his distrust of intellectuals. Mao responded with the Cultural Revolution, which saw the intelligentsia being sent to the countryside for manual labor. Post-secondary education was almost completely abolished in mainland China. There existed only 48,000 university students in China in 1970, including 4,260 in the natural sciences and 90 in the social sciences, 23,000 technical school students in 1969, and 15,000 teachers in training in 1969. Data on post-graduate students was not available, presumably because there were no such students. China had a population of around 830 million in 1970.\nIn China, the baby boomers grew up during the Cultural Revolution, when institutions of higher learning were closed. As a consequence, when China introduced some elements of capitalist reforms in the late 1970s, most of this cohort found itself at a severe disadvantage as people were unable to take the various jobs that became vacant.\nCultural and sociopolitical identities.\nPopular culture.\nIn the United States, a new doll named Barbie Millicent Roberts was brought to market in 1959, proving to be an icon of girlhood.264 The television set was available for sale right after the Second World War, and quickly became a major source of entertainment for families. Soap operas\u2014characterized by melodramatic plots focused on interpersonal affairs and cheap production value\u2014are a genre that was named after being sponsored by soap and detergent companies. They proved to be popular in the 1930s on radio and migrated to television in the 1950s. Again successful in the new broadcast environment, many of their viewers from the 1950s and 1960s grew old with them and introduced them to their children and grandchildren. In the United States, soap operas often dealt with the various social issues of the day, such as abortion, race relations, sexual politics, and inter-generational conflicts, and they often took positions that were, by the standards of their day, progressive. In Europe, and especially in the United Kingdom, the top soap operas typically featured working- or middle-class people, and most soap operas promoted post-war social-democratic values.\nFollowing the Second World War, the United States was not just a land of peace and prosperity but also of anxiety and fear of cultural deviancy and ideological subversion. And one victim of said moral panic was comic books. Some well-established fictional characters were attacked directly; Batman and Robin (Dick Grayson) were accuse of homosexuality and Wonder Woman of sexual deviancy. Comic books were blamed for the rise in juvenile delinquency in that country because a number of juvenile offenders admitted to reading them. This culminated in the book \"Seduction of the Innocent\" (1954) by Fredric Wertham, causing a decline in the comics industry. To address public concerns, in 1954 the Comics Code Authority was created to regulate and curb violence in comics, marking the start of a new era, the Silver Age of American comics, which lasted until the early 1970s. Unlike those of the Golden Age, stories from the Silver Age moved away from horror, and crime. Plots shifted towards romance and science fiction, deemed acceptable by the Code. For a variety of stories and characters, scientific-sounding concepts replaced magic and gods. Initially, many plots were escapist fantasies and reflected the cultural zeitgeist of the day, featuring traditional family values (with an emphasis on gender roles and marriage) as well as gender equality, But later, in parallel with the fomenting counterculture of the 1960s, comic books began addressing the social issues of the day, such as the civil-rights movement. Originally aimed at children, they soon attracted growing numbers of young adults; that the younger Baby Boomers had their imaginations fed by superhero comics ensured that this genre of fiction would remain in American popular culture well into the twenty-first century. A number of fictional characters invented during the Silver Age\u2014such as Batgirl (Barbara Gordon), Spider-Man (Peter Parker), and the X-Men\u2014continue to be popular decades later.\nJ. D. Salinger's \"The Catcher in the Rye\" (1951) attracted the attention of adolescent readers even though it was written for adults. The themes of adolescent angst and alienation in the novel have become synonymous with young-adult literature. But according to Michael Cart, it was the 1960s that saw the maturing of novels for teenagers and young adults. One early example of this genre was S. E. Hinton's \"The Outsiders\" (1967). The novel features a truer, darker side of adolescent life that was not often represented in works of fiction of the time. Written during high school and written when Hinton was only 16, \"The Outsiders\" also lacked the nostalgic tone common in books about adolescents written by adults. \"The Outsiders\" remains one of the best-selling young-adult novels of all time. \"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.\" (1970) by Judy Blume was another major success. Blume was one of the first novelists who focused on such controversial topics as masturbation, menstruation, teen sex, birth control, and death.\nCultural influences.\nIn the West, those born in the years before the actual boom were often the most influential people among boomers. Some of these people were musicians such as The Beatles, Bob Dylan, and The Rolling Stones; writers like Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Betty Friedan, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Herbert Marcuse, and other authors of the Frankfurt School of Social Theory; and political leaders such as Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, and Che Guevara. As romanticists and idealists safe from political retribution, radical youths did not care for competency or results as much as ideology. To this end, revolutionary icons such as Mao, Castro, or Guevara proved to be potent symbols. Kerouac, Ginsberg, and the poet Sylvia Plath encouraged their readers to question cultural norms. Parents, by contrast, saw their influence greatly diminished. This was a time of rapid change, and what the parents could teach their children was less important than what the children knew and what their parents did not. For young people, life was vastly different from what their parents experienced during the interwar and war years. Economic depression, mass unemployment, war, and chaos were a distant memory; full employment and material comfort were the norm. Such a drastic difference in outlook and experience created a rift between the generations. As for the peers, they did have a significant influence on young people, for while the \"modus operandi\" of youth culture at the time was to be oneself and to disregard the opinions of others, in practice, peer pressure ensured conformity and uniformity, at least within a given subculture.\nIn the United States, while the 1950s may be remembered by some as an orderly and tranquil decade, dissent and rebellion were just beneath the surface, ready to erupt. Indeed, the generational gap became apparent in the late 1960s.306 Moreover, the Baby Boomers lived through a period of dramatic cultural cleavage between the left-leaning proponents of change and the more conservative individuals. Analysts believe this cleavage has played out politically from the time of the Vietnam War to the present day, to some extent defining the divided political landscape in the country. Leading-edge boomers are often associated with the counterculture of the 1960s, the later years of the civil rights movement, and the second wave of feminism in the 1970s. Conversely, many trended in moderate to conservative directions opposite to the counterculture, especially those making professional careers in the military (officer and enlisted), law enforcement, business, blue-collar trades, and Republican Party politics. On the other hand, trailing-edge boomers (also known as Generation Jones) came of age in the \"malaise era\" of the 1970s with events such as the Watergate scandal, the 1973\u20131975 recession, the 1973 oil crisis, the United States Bicentennial (1976), and the Iranian hostage crisis (1979). Politically, early boomers in the United States tend to be Democrats, while later boomers tend to be Republicans.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the music industry made a fortune selling rock records to people between the ages of fourteen and twenty-five. This era was home to many youthful stars\u2014people like Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, or Janis Joplin\u2014who had lifestyles that all but guaranteed their early deaths.\nAcross the Anglosphere, and increasingly in many other countries, middle- and upper-class youths started adopting the popular culture of the lower-classes, in stark contrast with previous generations. In the United Kingdom, for instance, young people from wealthy families changed their accents to approximate how working-class people spoke, and were not averse to the occasional use of profanities. In France, the fashion industry discovered that trousers could outsell skirts in the mid-1960s. Blue jeans, made popular by the likes of actor James Dean, steadily became a common sight across the Western world, even outside of college campuses.A remarkable characteristic of youth culture from this period is its internationalism. Whereas previous generations typically preferred cultural products from their own countries, those who came of age during the 1960s and 1970s readily consumed the music of other countries, above all the United States, the cultural hegemon of the era. English-language music was normally left untranslated. Musical styles from the Caribbean, Latin America, and later, Africa also proved popular.\nIn Roman Catholic countries such as Ireland and Italy, the 1960s and 1970s saw a schism between the Church and the young on issues such as divorce or abortion. In the Canadian province of Quebec, religious attendance plummeted in the same period.\nIn China, despite the passage of the National Marriage Law in 1950, which prohibited having concubines, allowed women to file for divorce, and banned arranged marriages, arranged marriages in fact remained common, and the notion of marrying for romantic love was considered a capitalist invention to be opposed during the period of the Cultural Revolution.\nCounterculture.\nIn the decades following the Second World War, cultural rebellion became a common feature in urbanized and industrialized societies, both East and West. In the context of the ideological competition of the Cold War, governments sought to improve the material standards of living of their own citizens but also to encourage them to seek meaning in their daily lives. However, young people felt a sense of alienation and sought to assert their own individuality, freedom, and authenticity. Journalist Tom Wolfe coined the phrase \"Me Decade\" to describe the 1960s. By the early 1960s, elements of the counterculture had already entered public consciousness on both sides of the Atlantic, but were not yet viewed as a threat. But even then, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer acknowledged that the \"most important problem of our epoch\" was what many youths viewed as the empty materialism and superficiality of modern life. In the Soviet Union, the official youth periodical, \"Komsomol'skaia pravda\", called for attention to the \"psychology of contemporary young people\". By 1968, counterculture was considered a serious threat. In the United States, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) reported to the President that counterculture was a highly disruptive force not just in the nation but also abroad. In the CIA's view, it undermined societies East and West, from U.S. allies like West Germany, Japan, and South Korea to Communist nations like Poland, the Soviet Union, and China. Long-time director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) J. Edgar Hoover suspected that students' protests and counterculture were instigated by Communist agents. However, the CIA subsequently found no evidence of foreign subversion. Counterculture also affected Third World nations\u2014those that chose to remain unaligned in the Cold War. In the Soviet Union, director of the Committee for State Security (KGB) Yuri Andropov became paranoid about the internal security. Under General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, the KGB amplified its efforts to suppress politically dissident voices, though the Soviet Union never quite returned to Joseph Stalin's style of governance.\nWith hindsight, the CIA's assessments proved overly pessimistic. These youth movements had a bark that was worse than their bite. Despite sounding radical, the proponents of counterculture did not exactly demand the complete destruction of society in order to build it anew; they only wanted to work within the confines of the \"status quo\" to bring about the change they desired. Changes, if they came, were less well-organized than the activists themselves. Moreover, the loudest and most visible participants of counterculture often came from privileged backgrounds\u2014with heretofore unheard-of access to higher education, material comfort, and leisure\u2014which allowed them to feel secure enough in their activism. Counterculture was therefore not about material desires.\nCounterculture did, however, come with an entire pharmacopeia, including marijuana, amphetamines (such as \"purple hearts\"), and magic mushrooms. But perhaps the most notorious was a substance known as \"acid\" or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Synthesized in 1938 by chemist Albert Hoffmann in his quest to cure migraine, its use as a psychedelic drug was promoted in the 1960s by psychologist Timothy Leary. Attempts to ban it in 1966 made the substance even more popular. A number of cultural icons of the late 1960s, such as poet Allen Ginsberg were known for using this drug.\nDuring the 1960s, conservative students objected to the counterculture and found ways to celebrate their conservative ideals by reading books such as J. Edgar Hoover's \"A Study of Communism\", joining student organizations like the College Republicans, and organizing Greek events which reinforced gender norms. While historians disagree over the influence of the countercultural movements of the 1960s in American politics and society, they tend to describe it in similar terms. For instance, sociologist Todd Gitlin calls it self-indulgent, childish, irrational, narcissistic, and even dangerous. Moreover, it is possible that this movement did no more than creating new marketing segments for the specific sectors of the population, the \"hip\" crowd.\nProtests and riots.\nWhen they came of age during the late 1960s and 1970s, Baby Boomers immediately became politically active and made themselves heard due to the sheer size of their demographic cohort. Violent crime and protests increased markedly in the late 1960s and early 1970s. University students in three continents revolted.309 Many proponents of counterculture idealized violence and armed struggle against what they considered oppression, drawing inspiration from conflicts in the Third World and from the Cultural Revolution in Communist China, a creation of Mao Zedong intended to thoroughly sever the ties of society to its history, with deadly results. Some young men and women simply refused to engage in dialogue with mainstream society and instead believed that violence was a sign of their status as resistance fighters. \nIn May 1968, French youths launched massive protest demanding social and educational reforms, while labor unions simultaneously initiated a general strike, prompting countermeasures by the government. This led to a general mayhem in a manner similar to a civil war, especially in Paris. Finally, the government acquiesced to the demands of the students and workers; Charles de Gaulle stepped down as president in 1969.\nIn the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), the 1950s was a period of strong economic growth and prosperity. But like so many other Western nations, it soon faced severe political polarization thanks to youth revolts. By the 1960s there was a general feeling of stagnation, which stimulated the creation of the primarily student-backed Extra-parliamentary Opposition (APO). One of the goals of the APO was reforms to the university system of admissions and registration. One of the most prominent APO activists was Rudi Dutschke, who declared \"the long march through the institutions\" in the context of recruitment for the civil service. Another major student movement of this era was the Red Army Faction (RAF), a militant Marxist group most active in the 1970s and the 1980s. Members of the RAF believed the West German economic and political systems to be inhumane and fascist; they looted stores, robbed banks, and kidnapped or assassinated West German businessmen, politicians, and judges. The RAF's reign of terror lasted until around 1993. It disbanded itself in 1998. The RAF turned out to be deadlier than its American counterpart, the Weather Underground, which declared itself a \"movement that fights, not just talks about fighting.\"\nMany West German youths in the late 1960s were suspicious of authority. Student demonstrators protested West Germany's rearmament, NATO membership, refusal to recognize the Democratic Republic of Germany (East Germany), and the role of the United States in the Vietnam War. On the other hand, the construction of the Berlin Wall (starting in August 1961, after the Berlin standoff) by East Germany boosted anti-communist sentiments in the West, where there was growing demands for high academic standards and opposition to communist indoctrination. A sort of civil war erupted in German academia. The Free University of Berlin was the heart of West German student movements. Many leading professors left because of the asphyxiating political atmosphere. However, by the mid-1970s, things calmed down. Students were more interested in academics and career preparation. Indeed, counterculture had by this time invited stern public backlash. Resistance to change heightened. Major governments around the world implemented various policies intended to ensure \"law and order\".\nSome well-known slogans among youth rebels were, \"When I think of revolution I want to make love,\" \"I take my desires for reality and I believe in the reality of my desires,\" and \"We want everything and we want it now!\" These were evidently not what would normally be recognized as political slogans; rather, they were subjective expressions of the private individual.\nIn general, though, no major government was overthrown by the protests and riots of the 1960s; indeed, governments proved rather stable during this turbulent period in history. Growing demands for change stimulated resistance to change. Frustrated with the lack of revolutionary results despite their protests, which some skeptical observers such as Raymond Aron dismissed as no more than 'psychodrama' and 'street theater', some students became radicalized and opted for violence and even terrorism to achieve their goals. Nevertheless, other than publicity they achieved little. Doing one's \"revolutionary service\"\u2014as the joke goes in Peru\u2014did wonders for one's future career, though. From Latin America to France, students were aware that the civil service recruited university graduates and in fact, many had a successful career working for the government after leaving radical groups (and in some cases, becoming completely apolitical). Governments understood that people became less rebellious as they aged.\nIn the United States, protests against American participation in the War in Vietnam shook college campuses and cities across the nation, even though the U.S. Armed Forces were deployed for similar (anti-communist) reasons they were during the Korean War, a conflict that provoked little political headwind. This was a time of growing focus on the self and mistrust of authority. Young people were no longer interested in military service the way their forebears were. Draft evasion grew, and many took to the streets to demand the abolition of conscription, which became a reality. Some of these student demonstrations grew violent, with fatal consequences. Among counties that saw only peaceful demonstrations, the chances of the Democratic Party winning elections were unharmed. But in those that had riots, the Republican Party was able to attract new votes by appealing to the desire for security and stability. In fact, the backlash against the civil unrest of the late 1960s and early 1970s was so strong that even politicians in the 1990s like Bill Clinton had no choice but to endorse tough policies regarding public security in order to win elections. High-profile protestors such as the hippies who confronted the police were the target of public hostility and condemnation. Meanwhile, many American university students disapproved of their rebellious peers and concentrated on their studies.309\nIn Mexico, authorities deployed security forces to quell a youth protest in preparation for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City.\nAs a group, Western left-wing activists and radicals of the 1960s were intellectuals, and this was reflected in the ways their variants of political action and beliefs, primarily drawn from the experience in the classroom rather than on the factory floor. Many of these remained in academia and consequently became an unprecedentedly large cadre of cultural and political radicals on campus.\nOne side effect of the student revolts of the late-1960s was that it made unions and workers realize they could demand more from their employers. Nevertheless, after so many years of full employment and growing wages and benefits, the working class was simply uninterested in starting a revolution. To the contrary, some Americans even took to the streets to denounce counterculture and anti-war activists in the context of the War in Vietnam.\nIn China, Chairman Mao in 1965 created the Red Guards, which initially consisted mainly of students, to purge dissident CCP officials and intellectuals in general, as part of the Cultural Revolution. The result was general mayhem. Mao eventually opted to deploy the People's Liberation Army against his own Red Guards to restore public order. Mao disposed of millions of Red Guards by sending them to the countryside.\nHippies and the Hippie Trail.\nThe youthful proponents of counterculture, known as the hippies, disapproved of the modern world so much they sought refuge from it in communes and mystical religions. During the 1960s and 1970s, large groups of them could be found in any major European or American city. Male hippies wore long hair and grew beards, while female hippies eschewed anything that women traditionally wore to make themselves attractive, such as makeup and bras. Hippies were iconoclasts to varying degrees and rejected the traditional work ethic. They preferred love to money, feelings to facts, and natural things to manufactured items. They engaged in casual sex and used various hallucinogens. They were generally pacifists and pessimists. Many disliked politics and activism, though they were influenced by the political atmosphere of the time. A significant cultural event of this era was the Woodstock Festival in August 1969, which drew huge crowds despite bad weather and a general lack of facilities. Although it is commonly asserted that some half a million people attended, the actual figure is difficult to determine, even with aerial photography, as crowd experts would attest.\nThe so-called Hippie Trail probably started in the mid-1950s, as expeditions of wealthy tourists and students traveling in small groups. They started from the United Kingdom, heading eastwards. As Western European economies grew, so did demand for international travel; many bus services sprang up to serve tourists. The first hippies\u2014initially used to refer to men with long hair\u2014joined the trail in the late 1960s. Many young people were beguiled by Eastern religions and mysticism, and they wanted to visit Asia to learn more. Others wanted to escape the conventional lifestyles of their home countries or saw opportunities for profit. Some smoked marijuana and wished to visit the Middle East and South Asia, where their favored products came from. But air travel was in its infancy at this time in history and was beyond the reach of most. For those seeking an adventure, traveling by long-distance bus and trains from Western Europe to Asia became an affordable alternative. But not all who traversed the Hippie Trail were from Europe. In fact, many hailed from Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. Visas were easily obtained and in some cases were not required at all. Many young and naive Western tourists fell victim to scammers, tricksters, and even murderers, taking advantage of the nascent global drug culture at the time. The Hippie Trail ended in 1979 with the Iranian Revolution and the start of the Soviet\u2013Afghan War (1979\u20131989).\nSexual revolution and feminism.\nIn the United Kingdom, the Lady Chatterley trial (1959) and the first long-play of the Beatles, \"Please Please Me\" (1963) were to begin the process of altering public perception of human mating, a cause subsequently taken up by young people seeking personal liberation.\nIn the United States, the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) in May 1960 approved the first contraceptive pill, a drug that has had a huge impact on the nation's history. Invented by Gregory Pincus in 1956, the pill, as it is commonly called, marked the first time in human history when sexuality and reproduction can be reliably separated. The pill and antibiotics capable of curing various venereal diseases eliminated two leading arguments against extra-marital sex, paving the way for the sexual revolution. But the revolution did not happen right away; it was not until the 1980s that the pill become widely available in the United States and other Western nations. In the case of the U.S., contraception outside of married remained illegal until the 1970s.222-5 In fact, the first wave of Baby Boomers married and had children early, following the footsteps of their parents. Eventually, though, political attitudes towards human sexuality altered dramatically in the late 1960s because of young people. Although the behavior of most Americans did not change overnight, the heretofore mainstream beliefs on issues such as premarital sex, birth control, abortion, homosexuality, and pornography were openly challenged and no longer considered automatically valid. Individuals no longer feared social consequences when they expressed deviant ideas. Indeed, the 1960s and 1970s were the most consequential in the history of human sexuality. While there was a backlash on moral or religious grounds, the sexual mores in Western societies were forever changed. Nevertheless, there were concerns over possible abandonment or disrespect among (older) teenage girls and young women if they were to offer themselves to their boyfriends, a sentiment captured by the song \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow?\" from 1960. Going steady\u2014the practice of dating one person exclusively (as opposed to \"playing the field\")\u2014rose in popularity among young Americans following the Second World War and was part of mainstream youth culture through the 1980s, with teenagers beginning to go steady at progressively earlier ages.\nSexologist Alfred C. Kinsey's books, \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Male\" (1948) and \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Female\" (1958), employed confidential interviews to proclaim that sexual behaviors previously deemed unusual were more common than people thought. Despite triggering a storm of criticisms, the Kinsey Reports earned him the nickname the \"Marx of the sexual revolution\" due to their revolutionary influence. Many men and women celebrated their newfound freedom and had their satisfactions, but the sexual revolution also paved the way to new problems. Many young people were under peer pressure to enter relationships they felt they were ill-prepared for, with serious psychological consequences. Illegitimate births ballooned, as did sexually transmitted diseases. Public health officials raised the alarm on an epidemic of gonorrhea and the emergence of the lethal acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Because many had strong opinions on various subjects relating to sexuality, the sexual revolution exacerbated sociopolitical stratification.\nCoupled with the sexual revolution was a new wave of feminism, as the relaxation of traditional views heightened women's awareness of what they might be able to change. Competition in the job market led many to demand equal pay for equal work and government-funded daycare services. Some groups, such as the National Organization for Women (NOW) equated women's rights with civil rights and copied the tactics of black activists, demanding an Equal Rights Amendment, changes to the divorce laws making them more favorable to women, and the legalization of abortion.\nIn her book \"The Feminine Mystique\", Betty Friedan discussed what she called \"the problem that has no name\"\u2014namely, that married women with children were unhappy as housewives because \"There is no other way for a woman to dream of creation or of the future. There is no way she can even dream about herself, except as her children's mother, her husband's wife.\" \"The personal is political\" became the motto for the second wave of feminism. But the feminist movement splintered, because some became radicalized and thought that groups such as NOW were not enough. Such radical feminists believed that people should start using gender-neutral language, marriage should be abolished, and that the traditional family unit was \"a decadent, energy-absorbing, destructive, wasteful institution,\" rejected heterosexuality as a matter of principle, and attacked \"not just capitalism, but men.\" At the other extreme, staunch social conservatives launched a major backlash, for example, by starting anti-abortion movements after the Supreme Court of the United States declared abortion constitutional in \"Roe v. Wade\" (1973). Yet despite their best efforts, mainstream American society changed. Many women entered the workforce, taking a variety of jobs and thus altered the balance of power between the sexes.\nAlthough the new feminist movement germinated in the United States in the 1960s, initially to address the concerns of middle-class women, thanks to the appearance of the word 'sex' in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was primarily intended to prohibit racial discrimination, it quickly spread to other Western nations in the 1970s and especially the 1980s. More women realized how much power they had as a group and they made use of it immediately, as can be seen in reforms regarding divorce and abortion laws in Italy, for example.\nWomen flooded the workforce, and by the early 1980s, many sectors of the economy were feminized, though men continued to monopolize manual labor. Due to the law of supply and demand, such a surge in the number of workers diminished the prestige and income of those jobs. For many middle-class married women, joining the workforce made little economic sense, after accounting for all the extra costs, such as paid childcare and house work, but many chose to work anyway in order to achieve financial independence. But as the desire to send one's children to university became ever more common, middle-class women worked outside the home for the same reason their poorer counterparts did: making ends meet. Nevertheless, at least among middle-class intellectuals, men became much more reluctant to disrupt the careers of their wives, who were not as willing to follow their husbands wherever their jobs led them as was the case for previous generations.\nAlthough, in practice, the practitioners of feminism did not necessarily form an ideologically coherent group, they did succeed in creating a collective consciousness for women, something left-wing politicians in democracies were keen to acknowledge in order to court their votes. By the 1970s and 1980s, the traditional solidarity of the working class was fading away as different segments of this group began experience divergent economic prospects due to the continuation of industrial automation.\nFollowing the advent of a new atmosphere of sexual freedom, in the 1970s and 1980s, homosexuals were increasingly willing to demand acceptance by society and full legal rights. It proved difficult to object to what consenting adults practiced in private. Stating one's commitment to a heretofore prohibited or ostracized way of life, that is, 'coming out', was important to this movement. Homosexuality was decriminalized in England, Wales, and the United States in the late 1960s. The world's first Gay Pride parade took place in 1969. However, the HIV/AIDS epidemic acted as a brake on this social trend when its first victims were identified as such in the early 1980s. Writer Randy Shilts, himself a gay man, noted, \"HIV is certainly character-building. It's made me see all the shallow things we cling to, like ego and vanity. Of course, I'd rather have a few more T-cells and a little less character.\"\nMarriage and family.\nMarriage in many developed countries became much less stable in the 1980s, when Baby Boomers were getting married. In the West, this manifested in rising divorce rates. But this pattern was not seen East Asia. Instead, the region saw declining marriage rates, particularly in Japan, where social changes led to the deterioration of Japanese men's social standing after World War II. Men in East Asia were more likely to be unmarried than men in the West.\nBetween 1970 and 1985, the number of divorces per thousand people doubled in Denmark and Norway and tripled in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. In England and Wales, while there was only one divorce per fifty-two weddings in 1938, that number became one every 2.2 fifty years later; this trend accelerated in the 1960s. During the 1970s, Californian women visiting their doctors showed a marked decline in the desire for marriage and children. In all Western nations, the number of single-person households steadily rose. In the major metropolitan areas, half the population lived alone. Meanwhile, the \"traditional\" nuclear family\u2014a phrase first coined in 1924\u2014was in decline. In Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany, only a minority of households consisted of two parents and their children by the 1980s, down from half or more than half in 1960. In Sweden, such a family unit fell from 37% to 25% in the same period; in fact, more than half of all children in Sweden in the mid-1980s were born to unmarried women.\nIn the United States, what set the Boomers apart from their parents was not their marriage rates, or that they married in their early 20s, but rather that they were much more likely to be divorced. Divorced Boomers were less likely to remarry than their counterparts from the Silent Generation. Statistically, marrying before the age of 25 increased the probability of divorce. The nuclear family fell from 44% of all households in 1960 to 29% in 1980. But for African Americans, the figure was higher. In 1991, single mothers had given birth to the majority of children (70%) and headed a majority of households (58%). As women's labor participation rose, rumors that career-oriented women were unhappy and unfulfilled or that mothers regretted returning to work began to spread. Mothers-in-law and medical doctors began urging women to forgo their ambitions in order to have children early to avoid problems infertility later on. Popular media frequently exhorted working women\u2014if implicitly\u2014to quit their jobs. In a 1978 column for the \"Washington Post\", Richard Cohen coined the term \"biological clock\" in the context of women's fertility decline. Media outlets frequently glamorized women who pursued both demanding careers and had children before it was too late for them to do so. However, as psychologist Jean Twenge pointed out, statistics concerning women's fertility decline as a function of age used at the time were misleading because they relied on French birth records between 1670 and 1830, \"a time before electricity, antibiotics, or fertility treatment.\" Nevertheless, the share of American adults who rejected traditional gender roles steadily rose during the 1970s and 1980s. As more and more women became financially independent, the traditional reason for women to marry faded away. Marriage became increasingly viewed as an option, rather than an obligation. In fact, since the 1960s, marriage has stopped being primarily focused on having and raising children but instead, the fulfillment of adults. Married men were noticeably less willing to disrupt the careers of their wives. Unmarried women were no longer deemed as \"sick\" or \"immoral\" the way they were in the 1950s. In addition, neither working mothers nor single parenthood (what used to be called illegitimacy) was socially ostracized the way they used to be.\nParts of the reason why marriages were delayed or avoided were economic. People who entered the workforce during the 1970s and 1980s made less than their fathers did in the 1950s. Fertility rates fell as a result. The rise in the number of cohabitating couples was also a factor. These couples claimed cohabitation helped them assess the suitability of a mate before marriage.\nIn Italy, divorce was legalized in 1970 and confirmed by referendum in 1974. Abortion went through the same process in 1978 and 1981, respectively. In the Canadian province of Quebec, the birth rate fell considerably during the 1960s and 1970s as the influence of the Catholic Church declined.\nWhile sociologists had known for a long time that humans tend to select mates sharing many similar characteristics, a phenomenon known as assortative mating, during the 1970s and 1980s, an even stronger correlation between the educational levels of a married couple was observed in the United States. In fact, both the age at (first) marriage and the amount of time spent in school increased in the 1970s. Higher rates of university attendance and workforce participation by women affected the marital expectations of both sexes in that both men and women became more symmetrical in what they desired in a mate.\nPart of the reason why people increasingly married their socioeconomic and educational peers was economic in nature. Innovations that became commercially available in the late twentieth century such as the washing machine and frozen food reduced the amount of time people needed to spend on housework, which diminished the importance of domestic skills. Moreover, it was no longer possible for a couple with one spouse having no more than a high-school diploma to earn about the national average; on the other hand, couples both of whom had at least a bachelor's degree could expect to make a significant amount above the national average. People thus had a clear economic incentive to seek out a mate with at least as high a level of education in order to maximize their potential income. A societal outcome of this was that as household gender equality improved because women had more choices, income inequality widened.\nIn midlife.\nEconomic power.\nBy the early 2000s, the Baby Boomers reached middle age and were starting to save for retirement, though not necessarily enough. Seeking to increase their income and thus savings, many started investing, pushing interest rates to the floor. Borrowing became so cheap that some investors made rather risky decisions in order to get better returns. Financial analysts call this the \"seeking yield\" problem. But even the United States was not enough to absorb all these investments, so the capital flowed overseas, helping to fuel the considerable economic growth of various developing countries. Steve Gillon has suggested that one thing that sets the Baby Boomers apart from other generational groups is the fact that \"almost from the time they were conceived, boomers were dissected, analyzed, and pitched to by modern marketers, who reinforced a sense of generational distinctiveness\".\nThis is supported by the articles of the late 1940s identifying the increasing number of babies as an economic boom, such as a 1948 \"Newsweek\" article whose title proclaimed \"Babies Mean Business\", or a 1948 \"Time\" magazine article called \"Baby Boom\".\nFrom 1979 to 2007, those receiving the highest one percentile of incomes saw their already large incomes increase by 278% while those in the middle at the 40th\u201360th percentiles saw a 35% increase. Since 1980, after the vast majority of Baby Boomer college goers graduated, the cost of college has been increased by over 600% (inflation-adjusted).\nAfter the CCP opened up their nation's economy in the late 1970s, because so many Baby Boomers did not have access to higher education, they were simply left behind as the Chinese economy grew enormously thanks to said reforms.\nFamily values.\nAmong Americans aged 50 and up, the divorce rate per 1,000 married persons went from 5 in 1990 to 10 in 2015; that among those in the 65 and higher age group tripled to 6 per 1,000 during the same period. Marriage instability in early adulthood contributed to their high rate of divorce. For comparison, the divorce rate for that same period for people aged 25 to 39 went from 30 down to 24, and those aged 40 to 49 increased from 18 to 21 per 1,000 married persons.\nBecause the Baby Boomers came of age during a time of reliable contraception and legal abortion, their children\u2014the Millennials\u2014were wanted and planned. Boomers typically had fewer children than previous cohorts and invested more in each child. By the 1980s and 1990s, parenting in the United States had become more competitive.\nAmong Frenchwomen born in the early 1960s, only a third had at least three children. Yet they were responsible for more than half of the next generation because so many of their contemporaries had just one or even none at all. In the United States, one-fifth of women born in the 1950s ended their fertile years without giving birth. 17% of women from the Baby Boom Generation had only one child each and were responsible for only 8% of the next generation. On the other hand, 11% of Baby Boomer women gave birth to at least four children each, for a grand total of one-quarter of the Millennial generation. Those who had many children were likely religious (especially practicing Christians) while those who chose to remain childless were often members of countercultural or feminist movements of the 1960s and 1970s.\nDue to the one-child policy introduced in the late 1970s, one-child households have become the norm in China, leading to rapid population aging, especially in the cities where the costs of living are much higher than in the countryside.\nAttitude towards religion.\nIn the United States, radical activists of the 1960s prompted a backlash by religious leaders, who advocated a return to basic \"family values\". Evangelical Christians grew considerably in numbers in the 1970s. This movement became politically active, resulting in the fusion between Christian fundamentalism and neoconservatism in the late 1970s and 1980s and the election of Ronald Reagan as president.\nIn 1993, \"Time\" magazine reported on the religious affiliations of Baby Boomers. Citing Wade Clark Roof, a sociologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara, the articles stated that about 42% of Baby Boomers had already left formal religion, 33% had never strayed from church, and 25% of boomers were returning to religious practice. The boomers returning to religion were \"usually less tied to tradition and less dependable as church members than the loyalists. They are also more liberal, which deepens rifts over issues like abortion and homosexuality.\"\nIn later years.\nWork and retirement.\nBaby boomers started entering retirement in the mid-2000s and have already begun withdrawing their investments. Any economic activities that depend on the cheap capital courtesy of the Baby Boomers will cease to be. From a demographic point of view, the aging of the American workforce is inevitable due to the sheer number of the Baby Boomers. Economists expected the United States to face a labor crunch in the 2010s as more and more Baby Boomers retired. However, in 2018, a large portion of the older Baby Boomers (65\u201372 years of age) in the United States remained active in the labor force (29%), compared to the Silent Generation (21%) and the Greatest Generation (19%) when they were the same age, the Pew Research Center found by analyzing official labor statistics. The labor participation rate of women aged 65 to 72 in 2018 was 25% and of men of the same age group was 35%. This trend follows from the general expectation of Americans to work after the age of 65, as life expectancy is higher than for previous generations. The Baby Boomers who chose to remain in the work force after the age of 65 are mostly university graduates, whites, and residents of the big cities. That the Boomers maintained a relatively high labor participation rate made economic sense because the longer they postpone retirement, the more Social Security benefits they could claim, once they finally retire. Many of these Boomers work past the age of retirement not because they cannot afford to retire, but because they enjoy their work. Large numbers prefer semi-retirement arrangements or flexible work schedules. There is an ongoing shift away from pension plans in favor of 401(k) or similar options, which do not mandate retirement at a certain age. Among the Boomers who have retired, a significant portion opts to live in the suburbs, where the Millennials are also moving to in large numbers as they have children of their own. These confluent trends increase the level of economic activities in the American suburbs. Moreover, during the late 2010s, Millennials and seniors in the U.S. were driving up demand for affordable housing outside the major cities; to prevent another housing bubble, banks and regulators have restricted lending to filter out speculators and those with bad credit.\nAccording to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), elders in nations where people typically retire late like Sweden and Switzerland tended to experience memory loss at a rate twice as slow as their counterparts from countries where people usually retire early, such as France. Evidence suggests that those who remain mentally active are more likely to maintain their faculties.\nBy the mid-2010s, it has already become apparent that China was facing a serious demographic crisis as the population of retirees boomed while the number of working-age people shrank. This poses serious challenges for any attempts to implement social support for the elderly and imposes constraints on China's future economic prospects. In 2018, about 17.8% of China's population, or around 250 million people, was at least 60 years old. The Central Government has been considering raising the retirement age, like many other countries have done, though this is controversial among the Chinese public, who dislike postponing their pensions. As of 2020, China's retirement age is 60 for men and 55 for women working for the government or in other white-collar jobs. But China's demography is such that the nation's pension funds will be \"insolvent\" by 2035 if current trends continue, according to an official report.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may have spurred some Baby Boomers to exit the workforce. In the United Kingdom, data collected by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in June and July 2020 showed that 6% of those aged 66\u201370 and 11% of those aged 71 and older who were working immediately before the crisis had retired, half of whom had not previously planned to do so. In the United States, Pew Research Center reported that the number of Baby Boomers in retirement had increased by 2.3 million in 2020 the largest annual increase since the oldest Baby Boomers turned 65 during 2011. This surge in the number of retirees contributed to the labor shortage as the country recovered from the pandemic. In fact, the retiring Boomers contributed to an economic phenomenon dubbed the Great Resignation of the early 2020s.\nCountries facing population aging around the world have accelerated automation in order to cope with labor shortages and to help care for the elderly. In general, an aging population and a labor shortage accelerate industrial automation, not just to replace the \"missing\" workers but also to cut costs, though these technologies still have much room for improvement.\nFinancial position.\nIn the United Kingdom, the rate of home ownership of Baby Boomers was 75% and \"the real value of estates passing on death has more than doubled over the past 20 years\", according to a 2017 report by the Resolution Foundation. For this reason, the transfer of wealth between the baby boomers and their children, the millennials, will prove highly beneficial to the latter compared to previous cohorts, especially those who came from high-income families.\nA 2020 paper by economists William G. Gale, Hilary Gelfond, Jason J. Fichtner, and Benjamin H. Harris examines the wealth accumulated by different U.S. demographic cohorts using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. They find that while the Great Recession has diminished the wealth of all age groups in the short run, a longitudinal analysis reveals that older generations, including the baby boomers, have been able to acquire more wealth whereas millennials have gotten poorer overall. Nevertheless, some American politicians have warned that many senior citizens did not have enough savings for retirement. A survey found that nearly a third of baby boomer multimillionaires polled in the US would prefer to pass on their inheritance to charities rather than pass it down to their children. Of these boomers, 57% believed it was important for each generation to earn their own money; 54% believed it was more important to invest in their children while they were growing up. Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated in 2014 that the 'silver economy' would be worth US$15 trillion in 2020, up from US$8 trillion ten years prior. This dramatic growth is due not just to baby boomers retiring en masse, but also to their spending habits. While previous generations generally preserved their wealth and passed it onto their children, many baby boomers prefer to spend their money on their own long retirement.\nLeisure and other habits.\nAs younger generations move towards getting more of their entertainment via the internet, traditional television has held up better in the leisure time of baby boomers. Research from 2018 into British viewing habits suggested that individuals aged 65 to 74 (mainly older baby boomers) viewed an average of 333 minutes of broadcast TV each day higher than any younger age group and only nine minutes less than in 2010. In the case of younger baby boomers the figures suggested that 55 to 64 year olds consumed an average 277 minutes of broadcast TV each day in 2018 (still higher than any age range their junior) with a sharper decline since 2010 of 44 minutes. In the same year, three main cable news stations in the United States all had average viewer ages' within the Baby boomer range.\nIn 2019, advertising platform Criteo conducted a survey of 1,000 U.S. consumers which showed baby boomers were less likely than millennials to purchase groceries online. Of the baby boomers surveyed, 30 percent said they used some form of online grocery delivery service.\nLife expectancy and health.\nA 2020 study by sociologist Hui Zheng suggests that early US baby boomers (born between the late-1940s and early-1950s) and middle baby boomers (born between the mid- to late-1950s) had significant cognitive decline at age 50 and over compared to their elders, though the generations born before and during the Second World War had increasing cognitive scores from one generation to the next when they were at the same age.\nAround the world, people are living longer than ever before. Global life expectancy has increased from 47 years in the 1950s to over 72 years in 2016. As a result, the number of people older than 65 years of age has gone up over the decades, as has their share of the global population. However, the rate of population aging in the developing world is faster than among developed nations. Asia, South America, and the Caribbean are all aging rapidly. Globally, the ratio of the number of working-age people (15\u201364) to those aged 65 and over\u2014the support ratio\u2014has fallen from 11.75 in 1950 to 8.5 in 2012 and is on course to drop even further in the upcoming decades. These developments will fundamentally change the patterns of consumption in the global economy. The global disease burden will also change, with conditions affecting the elderly, such as dementia, becoming more common.\nAs countries around the world face the problem of a 'boomer dense' population, they find their tax revenues and what they can spend on elderly support in decline. Some countries, such as Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, have invested considerable sums of money on a variety of novel medical devices, robotics, and other gadgets to assist the elderly in their sunset years. Others, such as Austria and the Netherlands, have created specialized services for the elderly, among them dementia-friendly villages decorated with items and music from the 1950s and 1960s to help residents feel at home. Meanwhile, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and India passed legislation to incentivize people to provide more financial support for their elders. In the United States, the sheer number of baby boomers can put a strain on Medicare. According to the American Medical Student Association, the population of individuals over the age of 65 will increase by 73 percent between 2010 and 2030, meaning one in five Americans will be a senior citizen.\nPolitical evolution.\nIn Europe, the period between the middle to the late twentieth century could be described as an era of mass politics, meaning people were generally loyal to a chosen political party. Political debates were mostly about economic questions, such as wealth redistribution, taxation, jobs, and the role of government. But as countries transitioned from having industrial economies to a post-industrial and globalized world, and as the twentieth century became the twenty-first, topics of political discourse changed to other questions and polarization due to competing values intensified.\nScholars such as Ronald Inglehart traced the roots of this new 'culture conflict' all the way back to the 1960s, which witnessed the emergence of the Baby Boomers, who were generally university-educated middle-class voters. Whereas their predecessors in the twentieth century\u2014the Lost Generation, the Greatest Generation, and the Silent Generation\u2014had to endure severe poverty and world wars, focused on economic stability or simple survival, the Baby Boomers benefited from an economically secure, if not affluent, upbringing and as such tended to be drawn to 'post-materialist' values. Major topics for political discussion at that time were things like the sexual revolution, civil rights, nuclear weaponry, ethnocultural diversity, environmental protection, European integration, and the concept of 'global citizenship'. Some mainstream parties, especially the social democrats, moved to the left in order to accommodate these voters. In the twenty-first century, supporters of post-materialism lined up behind causes such as LGBT rights, climate change, multiculturalism, and various political campaigns on social media. Inglehart called this the \"Silent Revolution\". But not everyone approved, giving rise to what Piero Ignazi called the \"Silent Counter-Revolution\". The university-educated and non-degree holders have very different upbringing, live very different lives, and as such hold very different values. Education plays a role in this 'culture conflict' as national populism appeals most strongly to those who finished high school but did not graduate from university while the experience of higher education has been shown to be linked to having a socially liberal mindset. Degree holders tend to favor tolerance, individual rights, and group identities whereas non-degree holders lean towards conformity, and maintaining order, customs, and traditions. While the number of university-educated Western voters continues to grow, in many democracies non-degree holders still form a large share of the electorate. According to the OECD, in 2016, the average share of voters between the ages of 25 and 64 without tertiary education in the European Union was 66% of the population. In Italy, it exceeded 80%. In many major democracies, such as France, although the representation of women and ethnic minorities in the corridors of power has increased, the same cannot be said for the working-class and non-degree holders.\nIn the United Kingdom, political scientists James Tilley and Geoffrey Evans conducted a longitudinal analysis of the electoral behavior of the same cohort between 1964 and 2010 and found that the average likelihood of a person voting for the right-leaning Conservative Party increased by 0.38% each year. Previous research suggests that aging and key life events\u2014such as seeking employment, marriage, rearing children, and retirement\u2014all make a person more skeptical of change and more conservative.\nIn the United States, the baby boomers have been described as \"the largest and most powerful generation in US history.\" Even though the Baby Boomers were responsible for the cultural revolution of the late 1960s and 1970s, their political views shifted quickly and decisively during the 1980s. This was not because they wanted to reverse the changes they have brought about, but rather because they wanted to preserve the status quo. In fact, the level of support for conservatism among Boomers was higher than older generations when they were at the same age. Compared to younger generations coming of age in the early twenty-first century, boomers are more conservative as well. In addition, especially since the 1970s, working-class voters, who had previously formed the backbone of support for the New Deal introduced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, have been turning away from the left-leaning Democratic Party in favor of the right-leaning Republican Party. As the Democratic Party attempted to make itself friendlier towards the university-educated and women during the 1990s, more blue-collar workers and non-degree holders left.\nIn 2018, Gallup conducted a survey of almost 14,000 Americans from all 50 states and the District of Columbia aged 18 and over on their political sympathies. They found that overall, younger adults tended to lean liberal while older adults tilted conservative. More specifically, groups with strong conservative leanings included the elderly, residents of the Midwest and the South, and people with some or no college education. Groups with strong liberal leanings were adults with advanced degrees, whereas those with moderate liberal leanings included younger adults (18 to 29 and 30 to 49), women, and residents of the East. Gallup found little variations by income groups compared to the national average. Among people between the ages of 50 and 64\u2014older Generation X and younger Baby Boomers\u2014Gallup found that 23% identified as liberals, 32% as moderates, and 41% as conservatives. Among those aged 65 and over\u2014older Baby Boomers\u2014they found that 22% considered themselves liberals, 30% moderates, and 43% conservatives. (See above.)\nIn both Europe and the United States, older voters are the primary support base for the rise of nationalist and populist movements, though there are pockets of support among young people as well. During the 2010s, a consistent trend in many Western countries is that older people are more likely to vote than their younger countrymen, and they tend to vote for more right-leaning (or conservative) candidates. Due to the continued aging of these countries and the long life expectancy of their voters, right-leaning parties will continue to have a strong base of support.\nWhen the 'Golden Age' of economic boom finally came to a grinding halt in the 1970s, various reforms were introduced. High-skilled workers earned even more than before whereas low-skilled workers saw their fortunes melt away and consequently became dependent on welfare. This created a schism between the two groups, with the upper-end of the working class now supporting the political Right upon realizing that it was they, viewing themselves as hard-working taxpayers, who were the ones financing welfare, something they would rather do without except in cases of emergency. The fact that some governments incautiously made such welfare programs quite generous during the boom years exacerbated resentment for 'the underclass'. Public housing complexes came to be viewed as nothing more than residences for those who were socially problematic and chronically dependent on welfare.\nGenerational milestones.\nAccording to journalist and satirist P. J. O'Rourke, \"You're not a baby boomer if you don't have a visceral recollection of a Kennedy and a King assassination, a Beatles breakup, a U.S. defeat in Vietnam, and a Watergate.\" In a 1985 study of U.S. generational cohorts by Schuman and Scott, a broad sample of adults was asked, \"What world events over the past 50 years were especially important to you?\" For the baby boomers, the results were divided into two groups:\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"For better or for worse, the world today is committed to accelerating change: radical, wrenching, erosive of both traditions and old values. Its Inheritors have grown up with rapid change, are better prepared to accommodate it than any in history, indeed embrace change as a virtue in itself. With his skeptical yet humanistic outlook, his disdain for fanaticism and his scorn for the spurious, the Man of the Year suggests that he will infuse the future with a new sense of morality, a transcendent and contemporary ethic that could infinitely enrich the \u2019empty society.'\"\n\"Time\"\nIn recognition of the historical significance of this demographic cohort, \"Time\" magazine designated the Baby Boomers \"Man of the Year\" in 1966. The face most prominently seen on the cover representing the generation, called \"The Inheritors\" by \"Time\", was that of Thomas M. McLaughlin, an alumnus of Yale University and a decorated U.S. Air Force pilot who served in Vietnam. Due to their number, the Baby Boomers have been a dominant factor in American life since the time they were born. While they were being born and growing up from the late 1940s to 1960s, American culture was centered around child-rearing. As young adults during the late 1960s and 1970s, the Boomers instigated a period of serious social and political turbulence. While building their careers during the 1980s and 1990s, the Baby Boomers insisted on stability. When the youngest among them reached retirement in the early 2020s, they left behind a labor shortage. In fact, retiring Baby Boomers were a contributing factor to the Great Resignation. As Claire Raines points out in \"Beyond Generation X\" (1997), \"never before in history had youth been so idealized as they were at this moment.\" According to her, when Generation\u00a0X came along, it had much to live up to.\nAlthough the fortunes of their nation may wax and wane, as individuals, American Baby Boomers have been quite ambitious in what they expect from life. In spite of the fact that the seeds of expressive individualism had already been sown by the Silent Generation, it was the Baby Boomers who pushed for the social and cultural changes that echoed down the decades, many of which taken for granted by subsequent cohorts. For instance, young women in the 2000s could pursue careers their grandmothers could only dream about, and young people of color could take advantage of opportunities not accessible to their ancestors.\nWhile older Boomers who attended colleges and universities were interested in learning new things, later Boomers and Generation X were more likely to say they wanted to make more money. In fact, by the late 2010s, this has become the dominant justification for higher education. Later Boomers and Generation X were also the first group to treat higher education as a commodity and to consider themselves as customers who were entitled to high grades. Thanks to the Baby Boomers, materialism became the norm in American culture by the time Generation X came of age.\nThe experimentation with marijuana and psychedelic drugs spearheaded by some of the baby boomers in their youth has continued to present day, leading in some countries to re-evaluation of these substances as useful medicinal and psychotherapeutic tools.\nJust as Paul Erlich's \"The Population Bomb\" (1968) was released, feminist movements were spreading all across the Western world. As access to education improved and contraception became readily available, women during the 1970s and 1980s became a lot more willing to delay or eschew marriage and to reduce the number of children, if any, they had. Because so many women during this period seized the opportunity to control their fertility, they have had a significant impact on the trajectory of human history.\nThis intentional reduction of fertility occurred not just in Western countries, but also in places like India and Iran. Consequently, the predictions of Erlich failed to match reality. This development paved the way for the phenomenon of population aging observed in many countries around the world in the early twenty-first century. Geopolitical analyst Peter Zeihan predicted that this demographic trend would result in \"accelerating population falls unparalleled in speed and depth by any peacetime event in human history with the singular exception of the Black Plague.\" He noted, however, that baby boomers in Australia, New Zealand, Cyprus, Ireland, Iceland, and the United States had enough children so that their nations were not aging as rapidly as other developed and even some developing countries.\nAccording to the United Nations, between 2015 and 2040, East Asia would be the world's fastest aging region on Earth, with a forecasted increase in median age of 9.5 years. U.N. data also shows that the region has been aging faster than the global average since the mid-1970s. On one hand, this reflects dramatic improvements in standards of living compared to the 1960s; on the other hand, many East Asian polities, such as South Korea, are facing a demographic time bomb.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "47136", "revid": "45807317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47136", "title": "Ying Wa College", "text": "Boys' secondary school in Kowloon, Hong Kong\nYing Wa College (YWC, ) is a directly subsidised boys' secondary school in Kowloon, Hong Kong. It was established in 1818 in Malacca as the Anglo-Chinese College by Robert Morrison, the first Protestant missionary to China, before being relocated to Hong Kong in 1843. With over 200 years of history, it is the oldest school in Hong Kong.\nThe College Deed, signed in 1821, outlined the school's mission as the reciprocal cultivation of English and Chinese literature as well as the diffusion of Christianity ().\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nThe college's founder, Robert Morrison of the London Missionary Society, arrived in China in 1807 to begin his work of evangelisation. He planned to establish a school that would allow Western missionaries to learn Oriental cultures and languages, playing a role in introducing the East to the West and vice versa. He hoped to mediate between the two and thus to pave way for the quiet and peaceful dissemination of Christian thought in China. With the help of William Milne, who joined Morrison in 1813, the Anglo-Chinese College was established in 1818 in Malacca with Milne as the first headmaster. Even with Milne at its head, Morrison maintained a strong role in leading and fundraising for the school, and was a committed teacher.\nEarly period (1818\u20131858).\nApart from its work as a school, the college also trained evangelists and pastors. Amongst them, former student Hoh Fuk Tong () was made pastor in 1846. He preached in Foshan and Canton to his fellow Chinese people. Liang Fa (also known as Leung Faat), who was a craftsman in the printing centre of the college, also heeded the call to preach Gospel.\nA printing press was set up within the school premises to publish the Chinese Bible and other Chinese Christian tracts and publications, well before China was opened by the Opium Wars. In 1853, the first Chinese newspaper, \"Chinese Serial\", was published by the college's printing press.\nIn 1840, James Legge became headmaster. Two years later, Hong Kong was ceded to the United Kingdom under the Treaty of Nanking. The London Missionary Society thus decided to move the college to Hong Kong in 1843. The school building was situated at the junction of Staunton Street and Aberdeen Street. At that time, Christian churches had not yet been officially established. Thus the college was used as a religious centre where Christians assembled to worship. Since the London Missionary Society deemed that the college should focus more on the training of evangelists after the relocation, the college was renamed \"The Theological Seminary of the London Missionary Society in China.\" When Legge returned to Britain in 1846, he brought with him three of his Chinese students. Legge and the students were received by Queen Victoria.\nLegge held his headship until he was appointed by the Hong Kong Government in 1864 to help prepare for the opening of Queen's College. Due to the lack of a successor as well as political instability, the college ceased to operate at the end of 1856 and teaching ended in 1858. But the printing press continued its work until 1870 when it was sold to Wang Tao and Wong Shing.\nRestoration (1914\u20131929).\nIn 1911, the elders of the To Tsai Church together with Rev. Cheung Chuk Ling, Rev. W. T. Pearce and Rev. H. R. Wells revived the college so that the training of the sons of church members might be carried on. In 1913, the London Missionary Society responded to the appeal of the To Tsai Church. Rev. Arnold Hughes was sent to Hong Kong to assume headship, and the college was re-opened as a middle school in 1914 in rented premises, first at 9 Caine Road, later at 45 Caine Road, and finally at 82 Bonham Road (a former property of the German Rhenish Missionary).\nThe college grappled with many financial problems and it was at this time that help was received from the China Congregational Church. Financial assistance was also received from the Government.\nIn 1917, Hughes was called up for service in the First World War. Rev. W. T. Pearce became Acting Headmaster until Hughes returned after the war. The college suffered a great loss in 1922 when Hughes became ill and died in Japan while on his way back to England on sick leave. In that year, the London Missionary Society transferred Rev. L. G. Phillips from Amoy to Hong Kong. He served as Headmaster for over two years.\nWith Phillips's departure in 1924 and troubles in connection with the premises at 80 Bonham Road, the college entered another difficult period. The premises were rented from the government who now wanted to auction them off. The School Committee requested to be allowed to buy the property but there aroused a dispute with the Rhenish Mission even though the rental had originally been undertaken with a view to protecting the property and preserving it for the German mission. The committee contemplated closing the school, but eventually, the dispute was resolved and the college continued its operation under the headship of Richard Shum.\nExpansion period (1929\u20131963).\nIn 1927, the college decided to build its own campus. Shum succeeded in raising over six thousand dollars from the staff and students. Together with fourteen thousand dollars from the Provident Fund and a government subvention of twenty thousand dollars, the School Committee decided to construct the new school building on the site of Mongkok Church at Bute Street in Mongkok, with the understanding that the college was to share its new hall with Mongkok Church. The government withdrew its financial aid when construction work was underway and the college was completed in September 1928 with the aid of some loans.\nIn 1930, Shum resigned and the London Missionary Society agreed to urgent appeals from the School Committee that Rev. Frank Short should be allowed to serve the college as Headmaster. Rev. Short administered and developed the college so well that it was restored to the Grant List. The extra funds thus gained made improvement in facilities possible. Rev. Frank Short continued in office until 1938 when he had to devote more time to the administrative work for the London Missionary Society. Herbert Noble, who taught in the college since 1933, succeeded Short.\nIn December 1941, Hong Kong fell into the control of the Imperial Japan. The school building itself, commandeered by the Japanese authorities, was used as a P.W.D. depot. Mr Noble, being a member of the naval volunteers, was taken a prisoner of war.\nAt the closure of the war, the school building was restored to the School Committee and the college was re-opened in November 1945. Noble convalesced in London and was temporarily substituted by the senior master Yung Kai-yin. When Noble resumed duty in 1946, the enrolment had increased to such an extent that around 600 students crammed into the building originally designed for 350. The college premises in Bute Street, Mongkok proved to be too small to operate an ideal school. A project for building a new school was therefore contemplated and negotiations resulted in the selling of the existing land and building to the Mongkok Church.\nWith a plot of land granted by the Government as the college site, the school authority started the construction of a new campus in 1B Oxford Road, Kowloon Tong. The construction work suffered repeated setbacks concerning its location, foundation and plan. It was only through the zealous efforts of Noble, who exhausted himself, and the magnanimity of the public, who made generous donations, that the project was realised in June 1962. In the same year, Mr Daniel P. K. Au officiated at the foundation ceremony. The new campus was opened by Sir Robert Black, the Governor of Hong Kong, in October 1963.\nOxford Road period (1963\u20132003).\nThe Oxford Road campus was situated in a tranquil neighbourhood with adequate facilities. It was also a highly regarded school zone with some of the top schools in Hong Kong situated there. The college has reached its first climax during this period. But Herbert Noble, after serving the college for 30 years, retired in 1964 on account of his poor health. He returned to England soon after retirement and died in December 1964. He was remembered for his dedicated service and remarkable contributions which helped enhance the prestige of the school. The College Hall, for both the Oxford Road and later the Sham Shui Po campuses, known as the Noble Hall, was named after Mr Noble.\nOn the other hand, Ying Wa Primary School was forced to close down due to lack of space of the new campus. It was not until 40 years later that the primary school division was re-established.\nThe London Missionary Society, the then sponsoring body of the college, merged with other missionaries to form the Council for World Mission. The sponsorship of the college was subsequently handed over to the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China. A board of directors was established. Terence Iles was appointed to succeed Noble as headmaster.\nIles was most active in organising various extracurricular activities, with a view to developing students' all-roundedness. He had established the house system, in which students were divided into different houses upon arrival to the school. This intensified the competitive spirit within inter-house competitions, such as the Swimming Galas and the Athletic Meets. Speech Day and Open Day were first held during Iles's headship. The college newspaper, \"Torch\", was first published in 1964, making it the earliest school publication in Hong Kong. School teams joined various Hong Kong inter-school activities and competitions. In 1968, the school established its first Chinese Society to remind students of the importance of learning traditional Chinese culture in \"the reciprocal cultivation of English and Chinese literature and the diffusion of Christianity\".\nIn 1969, Iles admitted 15 girls to Form 6. This was controversial, but for some, a rather welcoming move.\nAfter 8 years of devoted service, Iles resigned in 1972 and was succeeded by Mr Rex King. In addition to improving the school facilities, he also attended to pupils' application, which resulted in marked progress in academic work. His efforts in promoting Putonghua was pioneering. During his headship, the number of classes rose to 31 while the number of students reached around 1200. When King resigned in 1978, Mr Mui Ho-bun replaced him as headmaster. 12 years later, Mui retired in 1990. An old boy and former member of the Legislative Council, Mr. Yeung Po-kwan, took over the reins.\nYeung reintroduced the house system that was suspended for decades in 1991. He promoted the democratisation of school policies and established the Parent Teacher Association.\nIn 2000, the board of directors put in an application to the government for the construction of a millennium campus (aka Y2K campus) on a plot of reclaimed land in West Kowloon. It also decided to re-establish the primary school division and consequently joined the Through-train scheme with effect from September 2003. The new campus at Ying Wa Street was officially opened in July 2003. The Primary School also had its first intake in September 2003.\nThe Millennium (2003\u2013present).\nThe relocation of the college was wildly debated within the school. Some feared that by withdrawing from the Kowloon Tong school zone, the standard of the college would be lowered. Others deemed that the Sham Shui Po District was far too distracting for the school to be set up there. But so far, it was proven that the new campus provided students with more space to engage in activities. Students also organised service projects to serve the neighbourhood, which was regarded as the poorest in Hong Kong.\nYeung stepped down in 2003 and was succeeded by Mr Roger Lee, an old boy of class 1979. Students were encouraged to join various kinds of activities and competitions and has won a lot of inter-school sports and music awards. In 2004, the handball team won the Inter-school Handball Competition for the tenth consecutive year.\nThe Ying Wa Heritage, a school museum, was established in 2005. Old artefacts and documents relating to the college were displayed, including a Bible published by the college back in the 19th century. Some of them were on display in an exhibition of the Hong Kong Museum of Education of the Hong Kong Institute of Education in 2012.\nIn March 2007, the board of directors decided to join the Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS) with effect from September 2007, making it the ninth school in Hong Kong to join the DSS.\nRoger Lee informed the students of his decision to leave the school in March 2011. Mr Allan Cheng, the Vice-Principal(Academic) and an old boy, served as the Acting Principal since September 2011.\nOn 11 November 2011, a celebration fun day for the 193rd anniversary of the college was held. It was the biggest anniversary celebration activity held since 2003.\nOn 23 November 2012, the Supervisor of the college confirmed that Cheng would become the Principal with effect from 1 January 2013, subject to final approval from the Education Bureau.\nOn 9 November 2018, Hong Kong Post issued a Stamp Sheetlet to celebrate the \"Bicentenary of Ying Wa College.\" It features the College motto \"Live the Mission, Brave the Course\".\nIn February 2021, Didi Tang stated that in light of the imposition of the Hong Kong National Security Law, Ying Wa College \"reportedly lost about 60 students in months.\"\nHouse system.\nThe house system was first introduced by Terence Iles during his headship in the 1960s. But it was later suspended and not until 1991 was it re-introduced by Yeung Po-kwan. The five houses, each with its own signature colour and mascot, commemorate five very important persons in the history of the school, namely Hoh Fuk Tong, Leung Faat, Milne, Morrison and Noble. The Houses, abbreviations, representative colours and mascots are as shown in the inset on the right.\nUpon entering the Ying Wa College, new students are divided into five houses. The five houses compete every year in culture, music and athletics with a prize. The house with the highest overall score is awarded a trophy. Through this system, the competition encourages student excitement, achievement, school mate camaraderie and greater enthusiasm and school spirit. In the past, student was divided into houses according to their classes during secondary 1, i.e. students of the same class belonged to the same house. This policy has changed in recent years, where now there are members of the five houses in one class in secondary 1.\nSchool song, school hymn, school cry.\nSchool song.\nThere are at least two school songs created since the establishment of Ying Wa College. The Ying Wa College Song (The British Grenadiers)(c.1914) and the current song \"Home of Our Youth\". The current song is written by Rupert Baldwin in 1938; it is also a figuration of the College, a symbol of the brotherhood of the students. \nHome of Our Youth.\n&lt;poem&gt;Home of our youth\nTo thee we bring the homage of lives at the spring\nTraining thy sons for the game of life\nSending them forth to the age-long strife\nReady thy name ever-bright to uphold\nReady \u2019gainst evil, to fight and be bold\nMay those who left thee in years that are past\nGuard well thy honour, to truth holding fast\nHome of our youth,To thee will we sing\nLong may thy name on our lips proudly ring&lt;/poem&gt;\nSchool Hymn.\nThe school hymn, \"We build our School on Thee, O Lord\" by Sebastian W. Meyer, is not used as frequently used as the school song; it is typically used in the Annual Speech Day amongst other ceremonious occasions. It is also used in some other schools in Hong Kong, including Sheng Kung Hui Lam Woo Memorial Secondary School, Sheng Kung Hui Tang Shiu Kin Secondary School, St. Paul's College and St Stephen's Girls' College.\nSchool Cry.\n&lt;poem&gt;TWO, FOUR, SIX, EIGHT, WHAT DO WE APPRECIATE? YING WA! YING WA! WA! WA! WA!&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe Ying Wa Cry is a mantra devised by former headmaster Mr Terence Iles for cheering purpose in inter-school sports events. Its use is not limited today, as students would chant spontaneously in various school events, like the swimming gala, the athletic meet and the school anniversary day.\nThere is a special tradition involving the Ying Wa Cry. Each time after the school song is sung (excluding formal events, e.g. events that take place in the Noble Hall), students would chant the cry continuously under the lead of one or more students, and the ceremony would end in a rumble of claps.\nTo lead the cry, one has to say (in Cantonese) \"Ying Wa Boys: one, two, three...\" (\"\u82f1\u83ef\u4ed4\uff1a\u4e00\u3001\u4e8c\u3001\u4e09\u22ef\u22ef\"), and then the mass would follow \"TWO, FOUR, SIX, EIGHT, WHAT DO WE APPRECIATE? YING WA! YING WA! WA! WA! WA!\"\nExtracurricular activities.\nStudent Council.\nEstablished in the 1960s, the College Student Council is responsible for organising various kinds of in-school and inter-school activities. The Council consists of ten cabinet members, sub-committee members and representatives of different student bodies, including the Prefects' Board, the Houses, the Music Union, the Sports Union, the school newspaper editorial board, as well as other clubs and societies.\nThe Cabinet.\nThe Cabinet of the Council consists of ten members:\nThe election of the Council is usually held in October, in which members of the Cabinet are elected by the whole school, including teachers and students. If the Cabinet is not formed due to whatever reason, the previous Cabinet (i.e. that from last year) will continue their service until the end of the first term. This had happened twice, in 2019 and in 2024. The Inauguration of the members of the Student Council, as well as the Clubs and Societies, will be held after the election. They are required to read out the Oath of Office after the Headmaster.\nOnce the Cabinet is formed, the cabinet members are responsible for the function of the Council. They are assisted by a group of sub-committee members in organising different events, such as the Annual Christmas Ball, Ying Wa Premier League (YWPL) (football) matches, Ying Wa Basketball All-star (YWBA) (basketball) matches, celebrating events on the School Anniversary Day, etc.\nThe Nineteen Members' Board.\nThe Nineteen Members' Board, known as the 'Big Nineteen' (or \u5341\u4e5d\u5927 in Chinese), consists of the ten members of the Cabinet as well as nine representatives of the student groups:\nThe Board is responsible for passing the proposal and the budget of the Cabinet.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "47139", "revid": "47900651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47139", "title": "Incandescent light bulb", "text": "Electric light bulb with a resistively heated wire filament\nAn incandescent light bulb, also known as an incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe, is an electric light that produces illumination by Joule heating a filament until it glows. The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb that is either evacuated or filled with inert gas to protect the filament from oxidation. Electric current is supplied to the filament by terminals or wires embedded in the glass. A bulb socket provides mechanical support and electrical connections.\nIncandescent bulbs are manufactured in a wide range of sizes, light output, and voltage ratings, from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts. They require no external regulating equipment, have low manufacturing costs, and work equally well on either alternating current or direct current. As a result, the incandescent bulb became widely used in household and commercial lighting, for portable lighting such as table lamps, car headlamps, and flashlights, and for decorative and advertising lighting.\nIncandescent bulbs are much less efficient than other types of electric lighting. Less than 5% of the energy they consume is converted into visible light; the rest is released as heat. The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb 16 lumens per watt (lm/W) for a 120\u00a0V bulb or 13 lm/W for a 230\u00a0V bulb, compared with 60\u00a0lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 100\u00a0lm/W for typical white LED lamps.\nThe heat produced by filaments is used in some applications, such as heat lamps in incubators, lava lamps, Edison effect bulbs, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy. Quartz envelope halogen infrared heaters are used for industrial processes such as paint curing and space heating.\nIncandescent bulbs typically have shorter lifetimes compared to other types of lighting; around 1,000 hours for home light bulbs versus typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 20,000\u201330,000 hours for lighting LEDs. Most incandescent bulbs can be replaced by fluorescent lamps, high-intensity discharge lamps, and light-emitting diode lamps (LED). Some governments have begun a phase-out of incandescent light bulbs to reduce energy consumption.\nHistory.\nHistorians Robert Friedel and Paul Israel list inventors of incandescent lamps prior to Joseph Swan and Thomas Edison of General Electric. They conclude that Edison's version was the first practical implementation, able to outstrip the others because of a combination of four factors: an effective incandescent material; a vacuum higher than other implementations which was achieved through the use of a Sprengel pump; a high resistance that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable, and the development of the associated components required for a large-scale lighting system. However, Joseph Swan's incandescent light bulb pre-dated Edison's and was sufficiently practical that it was actually installed and in daily use in London in 1881.\nHistorian Thomas Hughes has attributed Edison's business success to his development of an entire, integrated system of electric lighting.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The lamp was a small component in his system of electric lighting, and no more critical to its effective functioning than the Edison Jumbo generator, the Edison main and feeder, and the parallel-distribution system. Other inventors with generators and incandescent lamps, and with comparable ingenuity and excellence, have long been forgotten because their creators did not preside over their introduction in a system of lighting.\nEarly pre-commercial research.\nIn 1761, Ebenezer Kinnersley demonstrated heating a wire to incandescence. However such wires tended to melt or oxidize very rapidly (burn) in the presence of air. Limelight became a popular form of stage lighting in the early 19th century, by heating a piece of calcium oxide to incandescence with an oxyhydrogen torch.\nIn 1802, Humphry Davy used what he described as \"a battery of immense size\", consisting of 2,000 cells housed in the basement of the Royal Institution of Great Britain, to create an incandescent light by passing the current through a thin strip of platinum, chosen because the metal had an extremely high melting point. It was not bright enough nor did it last long enough to be practical, but it was the precedent behind the efforts of scores of experimenters over the next 75 years. Davy also demonstrated the electric arc, by passing high current between two pieces of charcoal.\nFor the next 40 years much research was given to turning the carbon arc lamp into a practical means of lighting. The carbon arc itself was dim and violet in color, emitting most of its energy in the ultraviolet, but the positive electrode was heated to just below the melting point of carbon and glowed very brightly with incandescence very close to that of sunlight. Arc lamps burned up their carbon rods very rapidly, expelled dangerous carbon monoxide, and tended to produce outputs in the tens of kilowatts. Therefore, they were only practical for lighting large areas, so researchers continued to search for a way to make lamps suitable for home use.\nOver the first three-quarters of the 19th century, many experimenters worked with various combinations of platinum or iridium wires, carbon rods, and evacuated or semi-evacuated enclosures. Many of these devices were demonstrated and some were patented.\nIn 1835, James Bowman Lindsay demonstrated a constant electric light at a public meeting in Dundee, Scotland. He stated that he could \"read a book at a distance of one and a half feet\". However he did not develop the electric light any further.\nIn 1838, Belgian lithographer Marcellin Jobard invented an incandescent light bulb with a vacuum atmosphere using a carbon filament.\nIn 1840, British scientist Warren De la Rue enclosed a coiled platinum filament in a vacuum tube and passed an electric current through it. The design was based on the concept that the high melting point of platinum would allow it to operate at high temperatures and that the evacuated chamber would contain fewer gas molecules to react with the platinum, improving its longevity. Although a workable design, the cost of the platinum made it impractical for commercial use.\nIn 1841, Frederick de Moleyns of England was granted the first patent for an incandescent lamp, with a design using platinum wires contained within a vacuum bulb. He also used carbon.\nIn 1845, American John W. Starr patented an incandescent light bulb using carbon filaments. His invention was never produced commercially.\nIn 1851, Jean Eug\u00e8ne Robert-Houdin publicly demonstrated incandescent light bulbs on his estate in Blois, France. His light bulbs are on display in the museum of the Ch\u00e2teau de Blois.\nIn 1859, Moses G. Farmer built an electric incandescent light bulb using a platinum filament. Thomas Edison later saw one of these bulbs in a shop in Boston, and asked Farmer for advice on the electric light business.\nIn 1872, Russian Alexander Lodygin invented an incandescent light bulb and obtained a Russian patent in 1874. He used as a burner two carbon rods of diminished section in a glass receiver, hermetically sealed, and filled with nitrogen, electrically arranged so that the current could be passed to the second carbon when the first had been consumed. Later he lived in the US, changed his name to Alexander de Lodyguine and applied for and obtained patents for incandescent lamps having chromium, iridium, rhodium, ruthenium, osmium, molybdenum and tungsten filaments.\nOn 24 July 1874, a Canadian patent was filed by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans for a lamp consisting of carbon rods mounted in a nitrogen-filled glass cylinder. They were unsuccessful at commercializing their lamp, and sold rights to their patent to Thomas Edison in 1879. (Edison needed ownership of the novel claim of lamps connected in a parallel circuit.) The government of Canada maintains that it is Woodward and Evans who invented the lightbulb.\nCommercialization.\nCarbon filament and vacuum.\nJoseph Swan (1828\u20131914) was a British physicist and chemist. In 1850, he began working with carbonized paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. By 1860, he was able to demonstrate a working device but the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate supply of electricity resulted in a short lifetime for the bulb and an inefficient source of light. By the mid-1870s better pumps had become available, and Swan returned to his experiments.\nWith the help of Charles Stearn, an expert on vacuum pumps, in 1878, Swan developed a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening. This received a British Patent in 1880. On 18 December 1878, a lamp using a slender carbon rod was demonstrated at a meeting of the Newcastle Chemical Society though it only worked for a few minutes. Swan repeated the demonstration at another meeting on 17 January 1879 where it worked successfully. It was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 February 1879. The society's building was the first public building to be lit by electricity. The lamps Swan demonstrated used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament. Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not commercially practical, although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum, a carbon conductor, and platinum lead-in wires. This bulb lasted about 40 hours.\nSwan then turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread' in the early 1880s and obtained British Patent 4933 that same year. From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England. His house, Underhill, Low Fell, Gateshead, was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb. In the early 1880s he had started his company. In 1881, the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster, London was lit by Swan incandescent lightbulbs, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity. The first street in the world to be lit by an incandescent lamps was Mosley Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom in 1880.\nThomas Edison began serious research into developing a practical incandescent lamp in 1878. Edison filed his first patent application for \"Improvement in Electric Lights\" on 14 October 1878. After many experiments, first with carbon in the early 1880s and then with platinum and other metals, in the end Edison returned to a carbon filament. The first successful test was on 22 October 1879, and lasted 13.5 hours. Edison continued to improve this design and by 4 November 1879, filed for a US patent for an electric lamp using \"a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected ... to platina contact wires.\" Although the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including using \"cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways,\" Edison and his team later discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could last more than 1200 hours. In 1880, the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company steamer, \"Columbia\", became the first application for Edison's incandescent electric lamps (it was also the first ship to use a dynamo).\nAlbon Man, a New York lawyer, started Electro-Dynamic Light Company in 1878 to exploit his patents and those of William Sawyer. Weeks later the United States Electric Lighting Company was organized. This company did not make their first commercial installation of incandescent lamps until the fall of 1880, at the Mercantile Safe Deposit Company in New York City, about six months after the Edison incandescent lamps had been installed on the \"Columbia\". Hiram S. Maxim was the chief engineer at the US Electric Lighting Co. After the great success in the United States, the incandescent light bulb patented by Edison also began to gain widespread popularity in Europe as well; among other places, the first Edison light bulbs in the Nordic countries were installed at the weaving hall of the Finlayson's textile factory in Tampere, Finland in March 1882.\nOn 4 March 1880, just five months after Edison's light bulb, Alessandro Cruto developed a process to create thin carbon filaments by heating thin platinum filaments in the presence of gaseous ethyl alcohol to coat them with pure graphite, and then sublimating the platinum at high temperatures. In 1882 at the Munich Electrical Exhibition in Bavaria, Germany Cruto demonstrated bulbs that were more efficient than Edison's and produced a better, whiter light.\nLewis Latimer, employed at the time by Edison, developed an improved method of heat-treating carbon filaments which reduced breakage and allowed them to be molded into novel shapes, such as the characteristic \"M\" shape of Maxim filaments. On 17 January 1882, Latimer received a patent for the \"Process of Manufacturing Carbons\", an improved method for the production of light bulb filaments, which was purchased by the United States Electric Light Company. Latimer patented other improvements such as a better way of attaching filaments to their wire supports.\nIn Britain, the Edison and Swan companies merged into the Edison and Swan United Electric Company (later known as Ediswan, and ultimately incorporated into Thorn Lighting Ltd). Edison was initially against this combination, but Edison was eventually forced to cooperate and the merger was made. Eventually, Edison acquired all of Swan's interest in the company. Swan sold his US patent rights to the Brush Electric Company in June 1882.\nThe United States Patent Office gave a ruling 8 October 1883, that Edison's patents were based on the prior art of William Sawyer and were invalid. Litigation continued for a number of years. Eventually on 6 October 1889, a judge ruled that Edison's electric light improvement claim for \"a filament of carbon of high resistance\" was valid.\nIn 1893, Heinrich G\u00f6bel claimed he had designed the first incandescent light bulb in 1854, with a thin carbonized bamboo filament of high resistance, platinum lead-in wires in an all-glass envelope, and a high vacuum. Judges of four courts raised doubts about the alleged G\u00f6bel anticipation, but there was never a decision in a final hearing due to the expiration of Edison's patent. Research work published in 2007 concluded that the story of the G\u00f6bel lamps in the 1850s is fictitious.\nThe main difficulty with evacuating the lamps was moisture inside the bulb, which split when the lamp was lit, with resulting oxygen attacking the filament. In the 1880s, phosphoric anhydride was used in combination with expensive mercury vacuum pumps. However, about 1893, Italian inventor Arturo Malignani (1865\u20131939), who lacked these pumps, discovered that phosphorus vapours did the job of chemically binding the remaining amounts of water and oxygen. In 1896 he patented a process of introducing red phosphorus as the so-called getter inside the bulb ), which allowed obtaining economic bulbs lasting 800 hours; his patent was acquired by Edison in 1898.\nIn 1897, German physicist and chemist Walther Nernst developed the Nernst lamp, a form of incandescent lamp that used a ceramic globar and did not require enclosure in a vacuum or inert gas. Twice as efficient as carbon filament lamps, Nernst lamps were briefly popular until overtaken by lamps using metal filaments.\nMetal filament, inert gas.\nUS575002A patent on 01.Dec.1897 to Alexander Lodyguine (Lodygin, Russia) describes filament made of rare metals, amongst them was tungsten. Lodygin invented a process where rare metals such as tungsten can be chemically treated and heat-vaporized onto an electrically heated thread-like wire (platinum, carbon, gold) acting as a temporary base or skeletal form. (US patent 575,002). Lodygin later sold the patent rights to GE.\nIn 1902, Siemens developed a tantalum lamp filament that was more efficient than even graphitized carbon filaments since they could operate at higher temperature. Since tantalum metal has a lower resistivity than carbon, the tantalum lamp filament was quite long and required multiple internal supports. The metal filament gradually shortened in use; the filaments were installed with large slack loops. Lamps used for several hundred hours became quite fragile. Metal filaments had the property of breaking and re-welding, though this would usually decrease resistance and shorten the life of the filament. General Electric bought the rights to use tantalum filaments and produced them in the US until 1913.\nFrom 1898 to around 1905, osmium was also used as a filament in lamps made by Carl Auer von Welsbach. The metal was so expensive that used lamps could be returned for partial credit. It could not be made for 110\u00a0V or 220\u00a0V so several lamps were wired in series for use on standard voltage circuits. These were primarily sold in Europe.\nTungsten filament.\nOn 13 December 1904, Hungarian S\u00e1ndor Just and Croatian Franjo Hanaman were granted a Hungarian patent (No. 34541) for a tungsten filament lamp that lasted longer and gave brighter light than the carbon filament. Tungsten filament lamps were first marketed by the Hungarian company Tungsram in 1904. This type is often called Tungsram-bulbs in many European countries. Filling a bulb with an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen slows down the evaporation of the tungsten filament compared to operating it in a vacuum. This allows for greater temperatures and therefore greater efficacy with less reduction in filament life.\nIn 1906, William D. Coolidge developed a method of making \"ductile tungsten\" from sintered tungsten which could be made into filaments while working for General Electric Company. By 1911 General Electric had begun selling incandescent light bulbs with ductile tungsten wire.\nIn 1913, Irving Langmuir found that filling a lamp with inert gas (nitrogen at first, and later argon) instead of a vacuum resulted in twice the luminous efficacy and reduced bulb blackening. He patented his device on April 18, 1916.\nIn 1917, Burnie Lee Benbow was granted a patent for the \"coiled coil filament\", in which a coiled filament is then itself wrapped into a coil by use of a mandrel. In 1921, Junichi Miura created the first double-coil bulb using a coiled coil tungsten filament while working for Hakunetsusha (a predecessor of Toshiba). At the time, machinery to mass-produce coiled coil filaments did not exist. Hakunetsusha developed a method to mass-produce coiled coil filaments by 1936.\nBetween 1924 and the outbreak of the Second World War, the Phoebus cartel attempted to fix prices and sales quotas for bulb manufacturers outside of North America.\nIn 1925, Marvin Pipkin, an American chemist, patented a process for frosting the inside of lamp bulbs without weakening them. In 1947, he patented a process for coating the inside of lamps with silica.\nIn 1930, Hungarian Imre Br\u00f3dy filled lamps with krypton gas rather than argon, and designed a process to obtain krypton from air. Production of krypton filled lamps based on his invention started at Ajka in 1937, in a factory co-designed by Pol\u00e1nyi and Hungarian-born physicist Egon Orowan.\nBy 1964, improvements in efficiency and production of incandescent lamps had reduced the cost of providing a given quantity of light by a factor of thirty, compared with the cost at introduction of Edison's lighting system.\nConsumption of incandescent light bulbs grew rapidly in the US. In 1885, an estimated 300,000 general lighting service lamps were sold, all with carbon filaments. When tungsten filaments were introduced, about 50 million lamp sockets existed in the US. In 1914, 88.5 million lamps were used, (only 15% with carbon filaments), and by 1945, annual sales of lamps were 795 million (more than 5 lamps per person per year).\nEfficacy and efficiency.\nLess than 5% of the power consumed by a typical incandescent light bulb is converted into visible light, with most of the rest being emitted as invisible infrared radiation. Light bulbs are rated by their luminous efficacy, which is the ratio of the amount of visible light emitted (luminous flux) to the electrical power consumed. Luminous efficacy is measured in lumens per watt (lm/W).\nThe luminous \"efficiency\" of a source is defined as the ratio of its luminous efficacy to the maximum possible luminous efficacy, which is 683\u00a0lm/W. An ideal white light source could produce about 250 lumens per watt, corresponding to a luminous efficiency of 37%.\nFor a given quantity of light, an incandescent light bulb consumes more power and emits more heat than most other types of electric light. In buildings where air conditioning is used, incandescent lamps' heat output increases load on the air conditioning system. While heat from lights will reduce the need to run a building's heating system, the latter can usually produce the same amount of heat at lower cost than incandescent lights.\nThe chart below lists the luminous efficacy and efficiency for several types of incandescent bulb. A longer chart in luminous efficacy compares a broader array of light sources. \nColor rendering.\nThe spectrum of light produced by an incandescent lamp closely approximates that of a black body radiator at the same temperature. The basis for light sources used as the standard for color perception is a tungsten incandescent lamp operating at a defined temperature.\nLight sources such as fluorescent lamps, high-intensity discharge lamps and LED lamps have higher luminous efficiency. These devices produce light by luminescence. Their light has bands of characteristic wavelengths, without the \"tail\" of invisible infrared emissions, instead of the continuous spectrum produced by a thermal source. By careful selection of fluorescent phosphor coatings or filters which modify the spectral distribution, the spectrum emitted can be tuned to mimic the appearance of incandescent sources, or other different color temperatures of white light. When used for tasks sensitive to color, such as motion picture lighting, these sources may require particular techniques to duplicate the appearance of incandescent lighting. Metamerism describes the effect of different light spectrum distributions on the perception of color.\nCost of lighting.\nThe initial cost of an incandescent bulb is small compared to the cost of the energy it uses over its lifetime. Incandescent bulbs have a shorter life than most other lighting, an important factor if replacement is inconvenient or expensive. Some types of lamp, including incandescent and fluorescent, emit less light as they age; this may be an inconvenience, or may reduce effective lifetime due to lamp replacement before total failure. A comparison of incandescent lamp operating cost with other light sources must include illumination requirements, cost of the lamp and labor cost to replace lamps (taking into account effective lamp lifetime), cost of electricity used, effect of lamp operation on heating and air conditioning systems. When used for lighting in houses and commercial buildings, the energy lost to heat can significantly increase the energy required by a building's air conditioning system. During the heating season heat produced by the bulbs is not wasted, although in most cases it is more cost effective to obtain heat from the heating system. Regardless, over the course of a year a more efficient lighting system saves energy in nearly all climates.\nMeasures to ban use.\nSince incandescent light bulbs use more energy than alternatives such as CFLs and LED lamps, many governments have introduced measures to ban their use, by setting minimum efficacy standards higher than can be achieved by incandescent lamps. Measures to ban light bulbs have been implemented in the European Union, the United States, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Canada and Australia, among others. The European Commission has calculated that the ban contributes \u20ac to \u20ac to the economy and saves 40\u00a0TWh of electricity every year, translating in CO2 emission reductions of .\nObjections to banning the use of incandescent light bulbs include the higher initial cost of alternatives and lower quality of light of fluorescent lamps. Some people have concerns about the health effects of fluorescent lamps.\nEfforts to improve efficacy.\nSome research has been carried out to improve the efficacy of commercial incandescent lamps. In 2007, General Electric announced a \"high efficiency incandescent\" (HEI) lamp project, which they claimed would ultimately be as much as four times more efficient than current incandescents, although their initial production goal was to be approximately twice as efficient. The HEI program was terminated in 2008 due to slow progress.\nUS Department of Energy research at Sandia National Laboratories initially indicated the potential for dramatically improved efficiency from a photonic lattice filament. However, later work indicated that initially promising results were in error.\nPrompted by legislation in various countries mandating increased bulb efficiency, \"hybrid\" incandescent bulbs have been introduced by Philips. The \"Halogena Energy Saver\" incandescents can produce about 23\u00a0lm/W; about 30 percent more efficient than traditional incandescents, by using a reflective capsule to reflect formerly wasted infrared radiation back to the filament from which some is re-emitted as visible light. This concept was pioneered by Duro-Test in 1980 with a commercial product that produced 29.8\u00a0lm/W. More advanced reflectors based on interference filters or photonic crystals can theoretically result in higher efficiency, up to a limit of about 270\u00a0lm/W (40% of the maximum efficacy possible). Laboratory proof-of-concept experiments have produced as much as 45\u00a0lm/W, approaching the efficacy of compact fluorescent bulbs.\nConstruction.\nIncandescent light bulbs consist of an air-tight glass enclosure (the envelope, or bulb) with a filament of tungsten wire inside the bulb, through which an electric current is passed. Contact wires and a base with two (or more) conductors provide electrical connections to the filament. Incandescent light bulbs usually contain a stem or glass mount anchored to the bulb's base that allows the electrical contacts to run through the envelope without air or gas leaks. Small wires embedded in the stem in turn support the filament and its lead wires.\nAn electric current heats the filament to typically , well below tungsten's melting point of . Filament temperatures depend on the filament type, shape, size, and amount of current drawn. The heated filament emits light that approximates a continuous spectrum. The useful part of the emitted energy is visible light, but most energy is given off as heat in the near-infrared wavelengths.\nBulbs.\nMost light bulbs have either clear or coated glass. Coated glass bulbs have kaolin clay blown in and electrostatically deposited on the interior of the bulb. The powder layer diffuses the light from the filament. Pigments may be added to the clay to adjust the color of the light emitted. Kaolin diffused bulbs are used extensively in interior lighting because of their comparatively gentle light. Other kinds of colored bulbs are also made, including the various colors used for \"party bulbs\", Christmas tree lights and other decorative lighting. These are created by coloring the glass with a dopant; which is often a metal like cobalt (blue) or chromium (green). Neodymium-containing glass is sometimes used to provide a more natural-appearing light.\nThe glass bulb of a general service lamp can reach temperatures between . Lamps intended for high power operation or used for heating purposes will have envelopes made of hard glass or fused quartz.\nIf a light bulb envelope leaks, the hot tungsten filament reacts with air, yielding an aerosol of brown tungsten nitride, brown tungsten dioxide, violet-blue tungsten pentoxide, and yellow tungsten trioxide that then gets deposited on the nearby surfaces or the bulb interior.\nGas fill.\nMost modern bulbs are filled with an inert gas to reduce evaporation of the filament and prevent its oxidation. The gas is at a pressure of about .\nThe gas reduces evaporation of the filament, but the fill must be chosen carefully to avoid introducing significant heat losses. For these properties, chemical inertness and high atomic or molecular weight is desirable. The presence of gas keeps the tungsten below its vapor pressure, allowing it to be operated at higher temperature without reducing its life (or, for operating at the same temperature, prolongs the filament life). On the other hand, the presence of the gas leads to heat loss from the filament\u2014and therefore efficiency loss due to reduced incandescence\u2014by heat conduction and heat convection.\nEarly lamps used only a vacuum to protect the filament from oxygen. The vacuum increases evaporation of the filament but eliminates two modes of heat loss. Some small modern lamps use vacuum as well.\nThe most commonly used fills are:\nThe gas fill must be free of traces of water, which greatly accelerates bulb blackening (see below).\nThe gas layer close to the filament (called the Langmuir layer) is stagnant, with heat transfer occurring only by conduction. Only at some distance does convection occur to carry heat to the bulb's envelope.\nThe orientation of the filament influences efficiency. Gas flow parallel to the filament, e.g., a vertically oriented bulb with vertical (or axial) filament, reduces convective losses.\nThe efficiency of the lamp increases with a larger filament diameter. Thin-filament, low-power bulbs benefit less from a fill gas, so are often only evacuated.\nEarly light bulbs with carbon filaments also used carbon monoxide, nitrogen, or mercury vapor. However, carbon filaments operate at lower temperatures than tungsten ones, so the effect of the fill gas was not significant as the heat losses offset any benefits.\nManufacturing.\nEarly bulbs were laboriously assembled by hand. After automatic machinery was developed, the cost of bulbs fell. Until 1910, when Libbey's Westlake machine went into production, bulbs were generally produced by a team of three workers (two gatherers and a master gaffer) blowing the bulbs into wooden or cast-iron molds, coated with a paste. Around 150 bulbs per hour were produced by the hand-blowing process in the 1880s at Corning Glass Works.\nThe Westlake machine, developed by Libbey Glass, was based on an adaptation of the Owens-Libbey bottle-blowing machine. Corning Glass Works soon began developing competing automated bulb-blowing machines, the first of which to be used in production was the E-Machine.\nRibbon machine.\nCorning continued developing automated bulb-production machines, installing the Ribbon Machine in 1926 in its Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, factory. The Ribbon Machine surpassed any previous attempts to automate bulb production and was used to produce incandescent bulbs into the 21st century. The inventor, William Woods, along with his colleague at Corning Glass Works, David E. Gray, had created a machine that by 1939 was turning out 1,000 bulbs per minute.\nThe Ribbon Machine works by passing a continuous ribbon of glass along a conveyor belt, heated in a furnace, and then blown by precisely aligned air nozzles through holes in the conveyor belt into molds. Thus the glass bulbs or envelopes are created. A typical machine of this sort can produce anywhere from 50,000 to 120,000 bulbs per hour, depending on the size of the bulb. By the 1970s, 15 ribbon machines installed in factories around the world produced the entire supply of incandescent bulbs. The filament and its supports are assembled on a glass stem, which is then fused to the bulb. The air is pumped out of the bulb, and the evacuation tube in the stem press is sealed by a flame. The bulb is then inserted into the lamp base, and the whole assembly tested. The 2016 closing of Osram-Sylvania's Wellsboro, Pennsylvania plant meant that one of the last remaining ribbon machines in the United States was shut down.\nFilament.\nCarbon has the highest melting point of any element, and in carbon arc lamps it had been demonstrated to produce incandescence fairly close to that of sunlight. However, carbon has a tendency to sublimate before reaching its melting point depending on pressure, which led to rapid blackening of vacuumed bulbs. The first commercially successful light bulb filaments were made from carbonized paper or bamboo. Carbon filaments have a negative temperature coefficient of resistance\u2014as they get hotter, their electrical resistance decreases. This made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply, since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up, reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further.\nCarbon filaments were \"flashed\" by heating in a hydrocarbon vapor (usually gasoline), to improve their strength and uniformity. Metallized or \"graphitized\" filaments were first heated to high temperature to transform them into graphite, which further strengthened and smoothed the filament. These filaments have a positive temperature coefficient, like a metallic conductor, which stabilized the lamps operating properties against minor variations in supply voltage.\nMetal filaments were tried in 1897 and started to displace carbon starting around 1904. Tungsten has the highest available melting point, but brittleness was a big obstacle. By 1910, a process was developed by William D. Coolidge at General Electric for production of a ductile form of tungsten. The process required pressing tungsten powder into bars, then several steps of sintering, swaging, and then wire drawing. It was found that very pure tungsten formed filaments that sagged in use, and that a very small \"doping\" treatment with potassium, silicon, and aluminium oxides at the level of a few hundred parts per million (so-called AKS tungsten) greatly improved the life and durability of the tungsten filaments.\nThe predominant mechanism for failure in tungsten filaments even now is grain boundary sliding accommodated by diffusional creep. During operation, the tungsten wire is stressed under the load of its own weight and because of the diffusion that can occur at high temperatures, grains begin to rotate and slide. This stress, because of variations in the filament, causes the filament to sag nonuniformly, which ultimately introduces further torque on the filament. It is this sagging that inevitably results in a rupture of the filament, rendering the incandescent lightbulb useless.\nCoiled coil filament.\nTo improve the efficiency of the lamp, the filament usually consists of multiple coils of coiled fine wire, also known as a coiled coil. Light bulbs using coiled coil filaments are sometimes referred to as 'double-coil bulbs'. For a 60-watt 120-volt lamp, the uncoiled length of the tungsten filament is usually , and the filament diameter is . The advantage of the coiled coil is that evaporation of the tungsten filament is at the rate of a tungsten cylinder having a diameter equal to that of the coiled coil. The coiled-coil filament evaporates more slowly than a straight filament of the same surface area and light-emitting power. As a result, the filament can then run hotter, which results in a more efficient light source while lasting longer than a straight filament at the same temperature.\nManufacturers designate different forms of lamp filament with an alphanumeric code.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nElectrical filaments are also used in hot cathodes of fluorescent lamps and vacuum tubes as a source of electrons or in vacuum tubes to heat an electron-emitting electrode. When used as a source of electrons, they may have a special coating that increases electron production.\nReducing filament evaporation.\nDuring ordinary operation, the tungsten of the filament evaporates; hotter, more-efficient filaments evaporate faster. Because of this, the lifetime of a filament lamp is a trade-off between efficiency and longevity. The trade-off is typically set to provide a lifetime of 1,000 to 2,000 hours for lamps used for general illumination. Theatrical, photographic, and projection lamps may have a useful life of only a few hours, trading life expectancy for high output in a compact form. Long-life general service lamps have lower efficiency, but prior to the development of compact fluorescent and LED lamps they were useful in applications where the bulb was difficult to change.\nIrving Langmuir found that an inert gas, instead of vacuum, would retard evaporation. General service incandescent light bulbs over about 25 watts in rating are now filled with a mixture of mostly argon and some nitrogen, or sometimes krypton. While inert gas reduces filament evaporation, it also conducts heat from the filament, thereby cooling the filament and reducing efficiency. At constant pressure and temperature, the thermal conductivity of a gas depends upon the molecular weight of the gas and the cross sectional area of the gas molecules. Higher molecular weight gases have lower thermal conductivity, because both the molecular weight and cross sectional area are higher. Xenon gas improves efficiency because of its high molecular weight, but is also more expensive, so its use is limited to smaller lamps.\n\"Filament notching\" is due to uneven evaporation of the filament. Small variations in resistivity along the filament cause \"hot spots\" to form at points of higher resistivity; a variation of diameter of only 1% will cause a 25% reduction in service life. Since filament resistance is highly temperature-dependent, spots with higher temperature will have higher resistance, causing them to dissipate more energy, making them hotter \u2013 a positive feedback loop. These hot spots evaporate faster than the rest of the filament, permanently increasing the resistance at that point. The process ends in the familiar tiny gap in an otherwise healthy-looking filament.\nLamps operated on direct current develop random stairstep irregularities on the filament surface which may cut lifespan in half compared to AC operation; different alloys of tungsten and rhenium can be used to counteract the effect.\nSince a filament breaking in a gas-filled bulb can form an electric arc, which may spread between the terminals and draw very heavy current, intentionally thin lead-in wires or more elaborate protection devices are therefore often used as fuses built into the light bulb. More nitrogen is used in higher-voltage lamps to reduce the possibility of arcing.\nBulb blackening.\nIn a conventional lamp, the evaporated tungsten eventually condenses on the inner surface of the glass envelope, darkening it. For bulbs that contain a vacuum, the darkening is uniform across the entire surface of the envelope. When a filling of inert gas is used, the evaporated tungsten is carried in the thermal convection currents of the gas, and is deposited preferentially on the uppermost part of the envelope, blackening just that portion of the envelope. An incandescent lamp that gives 93% or less of its initial light output at 75% of its rated life is regarded as unsatisfactory, when tested according to IEC Publication 60064. Light loss is due to filament evaporation and bulb blackening. Study of the problem of bulb blackening led to the discovery of thermionic emission, the invention of the vacuum tube, and evaporation deposition used to make mirrors and other optical coatings.\nA very small amount of water vapor inside a light bulb can significantly increase lamp darkening. Water vapor dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen at the hot filament. The oxygen attacks the tungsten metal, and the resulting tungsten oxide particles travel to cooler parts of the lamp. Hydrogen from water vapor reduces the oxide, reforming water vapor and continuing this \"water cycle\". The equivalent of a drop of water distributed over 500,000 lamps will significantly increase darkening. Small amounts of substances such as zirconium are placed within the lamp as a getter to react with any oxygen that may bake out of the lamp components during operation.\nSome old, high-powered lamps used in theater, projection, searchlight, and lighthouse service with heavy, sturdy filaments contained loose tungsten powder within the envelope. From time to time, the operator would remove the bulb and shake it, allowing the tungsten powder to scrub off most of the tungsten that had condensed on the interior of the envelope, removing the blackening and brightening the lamp again.\nHalogen lamps.\nThe halogen lamp reduces uneven evaporation of the filament and eliminates darkening of the envelope by filling the lamp with a halogen gas at low pressure, along with an inert gas. The halogen cycle increases the lifetime of the bulb and prevents its darkening by redepositing tungsten from the inside of the bulb back onto the filament. The halogen lamp can operate its filament at a higher temperature than a standard gas filled lamp of similar power without loss of operating life. Such bulbs are much smaller than normal incandescent bulbs, and are widely used where intense illumination is needed in a limited space. Fiber-optic lamps for optical microscopy is one typical application.\nIncandescent arc lamps.\nA variation of the incandescent lamp did not use a hot wire filament, but instead used an arc struck on a spherical bead electrode to produce heat. The electrode then became incandescent, with the arc contributing little to the light produced. Such lamps were used for projection or illumination for scientific instruments such as microscopes. These arc lamps ran on relatively low voltages and incorporated tungsten filaments to start ionization within the envelope. They provided the intense concentrated light of an arc lamp but were easier to operate. Developed around 1915, these lamps were displaced by mercury and xenon arc lamps.\nElectrical characteristics.\nPower.\nIncandescent lamps are nearly pure resistive loads with a power factor of 1. Unlike discharge lamps or LED lamps, the power consumed is equal to the apparent power in the circuit. Incandescent light bulbs are usually marketed according to the electrical power consumed. This depends mainly on the operating resistance of the filament. For two bulbs of the same voltage, and type, the higher-powered bulb gives more light.\nThe table shows the approximate typical output, in lumens, of standard 120 volt incandescent light bulbs at various powers. Light output of similar 230\u00a0V bulbs is slightly less. The lower current (higher voltage) filament is thinner and has to be operated at a slightly lower temperature for the same life expectancy, which reduces energy efficiency. The lumen values for \"soft white\" bulbs will generally be slightly lower than for clear bulbs at the same power.\nCurrent and resistance.\nThe resistance of the filament is temperature dependent. The cold resistance of tungsten-filament lamps is about &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204415 the resistance when operating. For example, a 100-watt, 120-volt lamp has a resistance of 144\u00a0ohms when lit, but the cold resistance is much lower (about 9.5\u00a0ohms). Since incandescent lamps are resistive loads, simple phase-control TRIAC dimmers can be used to control brightness. Electrical contacts may carry a \"T\" rating symbol indicating that they are designed to control circuits with the high inrush current characteristic of tungsten lamps. For a 100-watt, 120-volt general-service lamp, the current stabilizes in about 0.10 seconds, and the lamp reaches 90% of its full brightness after about 0.13 seconds.\nPhysical characteristics.\nSafety.\nThe filament in a tungsten light bulb is not easy to break when the bulb is cold, but filaments are more vulnerable when they are hot because the incandescent metal is less rigid. An impact on the outside of the bulb may cause the filament to break or experience a surge in electric current that causes part of it to melt or vaporize.\nIn most modern incandescent bulbs, part of the wire inside the bulb acts like a fuse: if a broken filament produces an electrical short inside the bulb, the fusible section of wire will melt and cut the current off to prevent damage to the supply lines.\nA hot glass bulb may fracture on contact with cold objects. When the glass envelope breaks, the bulb implodes, exposing the filament to ambient air. The air then usually destroys the hot filament through oxidation.\nBulb shapes.\nBulb shape and size designations are given in national standards. \nSome designations are one or more letters followed by one or more numbers, e.g. A55 or PAR38, where the letters identify the shape and the numbers some characteristic size.\nNational standards such as ANSI C79.1-2002, IS 14897:2000 and JIS C 7710:1988 cover a common terminology for bulb shapes.\nLight emitted in (nearly) all directions. Available either clear or frosted.\nTypes: General (A), elliptical (E), mushroom (M), sign (S), tubular (T)\n120\u00a0V sizes: A17, 19 and 21\n230\u00a0V sizes: A55 and 60\nLamps greater than 200 watts.\nTypes: Pear-shaped (PS)\nlamps used in chandeliers, etc. Smaller candle-sized bulbs may use a smaller socket.\nTypes: candle (B), twisted candle, bent-tip candle (CA &amp; BA), flame (F), globe (G), lantern chimney (H), fancy round (P)\n230\u00a0V sizes: P45, G95\nTypes: Standard reflector (R), bulged reflector (BR), elliptical reflector (ER), crown-silvered\n120\u00a0V sizes: R16, 20, 25 and 30\n230\u00a0V sizes: R50, 63, 80 and 95\nParabolic aluminized reflector (PAR) bulbs control light more precisely. They produce about four times the concentrated light intensity of general service (A), and are used in recessed and track lighting. Weatherproof casings are available for outdoor spot and flood fixtures.\n120\u00a0V sizes: PAR 16, 20, 30, 38, 56 and 64\n230\u00a0V sizes: PAR 16, 20, 30, 38, 56 and 64\nAvailable in numerous spot and flood beam spreads. Like all light bulbs, the number represents the diameter of the bulb in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20448 of an inch. Therefore, a PAR 16 is in diameter, a PAR 20 is in diameter, PAR 30 is and a PAR 38 is in diameter.\nMultifaceted reflector bulbs are usually smaller in size and run at a lower voltage, often 12\u00a0V.\nLamp bases.\nLarge lamps may have a screw base or a bayonet base, with one or more contacts on the base. The shell may serve as an electrical contact or only as a mechanical support. Bayonet base lamps are frequently used in automotive lamps to resist loosening by vibration. Some tubular lamps have an electrical contact at either end. Miniature lamps may have a wedge base and wire contacts, and some automotive and special purpose lamps have screw terminals for connection to wires. Very small lamps may have the filament support wires extended through the base of the lamp for connections. A bipin base is often used for halogen or reflector lamps.\nIn the late 19th century, manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible lamp bases. General Electric's \"Mazda\" standard base sizes were soon adopted across the US.\nLamp bases may be secured to the bulb with a cement, or by mechanical crimping to indentations molded into the glass bulb.\nLamps intended for use in optical systems have bases with alignment features so that the filament is positioned accurately within the optical system. A screw-base lamp may have a random orientation of the filament when the lamp is installed in the socket.\nContacts in the lightbulb socket allow the electric current to pass through the base to the filament. The socket provides electrical connections and mechanical support, and allows changing the lamp when it burns out.\nLight output and lifetime.\nIncandescent lamps are very sensitive to changes in the supply voltage. These characteristics are of great practical and economic importance.\nFor a supply voltage \"V\" near the rated voltage of the lamp:\nA 5% reduction in voltage will double the life of the bulb, but reduce its light output by about 16%. Long-life bulbs take advantage of this trade-off in applications such as traffic signal lamps. Since electric energy they use costs more than the cost of the bulb, general service lamps emphasize efficiency over long operating life. The objective is to minimize the cost of light, not the cost of lamps. Early bulbs had a life of up to 2500 hours, but in 1924 the Phoebus cartel agreed to limit life to 1000 hours. When this was exposed in 1953, General Electric and other leading American manufacturers were banned from limiting the life.\nThe relationships above are valid for only a few percent change of voltage around standard rated conditions, but they indicate that a lamp operated at low voltage could last much longer than at rated voltage, albeit with greatly reduced light output. The \"Centennial Light\" is a light bulb that is accepted by the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as having been burning almost continuously at a fire station in Livermore, California, since 1901. However, the bulb emits the equivalent light of a four watt bulb. A similar story can be told of a 40-watt bulb in Texas that has been illuminated since 21 September 1908. It once resided in an opera house where notable celebrities stopped to take in its glow, and was moved to an area museum in 1977.\nPhotoflood lamps used for photographic lighting favor light output over life, with some lasting only two hours. The upper temperature limit for the filament is the melting point of the metal. Tungsten is the metal with the highest melting point, . A 50-hour-life projection bulb, for instance, is designed to operate only below that melting point. Such a lamp may achieve up to 22 lumens per watt, compared with 17.5 for a 750-hour general service lamp.\nLamps of the same power rating but designed for different voltages have different luminous efficacy. For example, a 100-watt, 1000 hour, 120-volt lamp will produce about 17.1 lumens per watt. A similar lamp designed for 230\u00a0V would produce only around 12.8 lumens per watt, and one designed for 30 volts (train lighting) would produce as much as 19.8 lumens per watt. Lower voltage lamps have a thicker filament, for the same power rating. They can run hotter for the same lifetime before the filament evaporates.\nThe wires used to support the filament make it mechanically stronger, but remove heat, creating another tradeoff between efficiency and long life. Many general-service 120-volt lamps use no additional support wires, but lamps designed for \"rough service\" or \"vibration service\" may have as many as five. Low-voltage lamps have filaments made of heavier wire and do not require additional support wires.\nVery low voltages are inefficient since the lead wires would conduct too much heat away from the filament, so the practical lower limit for incandescent lamps is 1.5 volts. Very long filaments for high voltages are fragile, and lamp bases become more difficult to insulate, so lamps for illumination are not made with rated voltages over 300 volts. Some infrared heating elements are made for higher voltages, but these use tubular bulbs with widely separated terminals.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Members are generally unrelated to each other, unlike in an asteroid family, which often results from the break-up of a single asteroid. It is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered, which is often the largest.\nGroups out to the orbit of Earth.\nThere are relatively few asteroids that orbit close to the Sun. Several of these groups are hypothetical at this point in time, with no members having yet been discovered; as such, the names they have been given are provisional.\nThe asteroid belt.\nThe overwhelming majority of known asteroids have orbits lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, roughly between 2 and 4\u00a0AU. These could not form a planet due to the gravitational influence of Jupiter. Jupiter's gravitational influence, through orbital resonance, clears Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt, first recognised by Daniel Kirkwood in 1874.\nThe region with the densest concentration (lying between the Kirkwood gaps at 2.06 and 3.27\u00a0AU, with eccentricities below about 0.3, and inclinations smaller than 30\u00b0) is called the asteroid belt.

Bassey is one of the most popular vocalists in Britain.\nBorn in Cardiff, Bassey began performing as a teenager in 1953. In 1959, she became the first Welsh person to gain a number-one single on the UK Singles Chart. In the following decades, Bassey amassed 27 top 40 hits in the UK, including two number ones (\"As I Love You\" and the double A-side \"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\"/\"Reach for the Stars\") plus a number one on the Dance Chart (\"History Repeating\"). She became well known for recording theme songs of the James Bond films \"Goldfinger\" (1964), \"Diamonds Are Forever\" (1971), and \"Moonraker\" (1979).\nBassey has had numerous BBC television specials and hosted her own variety series, \"Shirley Bassey\". In 2011, BBC aired the television film \"Shirley\", based on Bassey's life and career. Since making her first appearance at the Royal Albert Hall in 1971, she has performed at the venue 45 times. Bassey received the first award for Best British Female Solo Artist at the 1st Brit Awards in 1977. She was appointed a Dame in 1999 for services to the performing arts. In 2003, she was ranked among the \"100 Great Black Britons\". Her song \"Goldfinger\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008. She has influenced many other singers, including Aretha Franklin.\nIn a career spanning more than 70 years, Bassey has sold more than 140 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling female artists of all time. She is the first woman in history to claim a Top 40 album in seven consecutive decades in the United Kingdom.\nEarly life.\nShirley Veronica Bassey was born the sixth and youngest child of Henry Bassey and Eliza Jane Start on Bute Street in Tiger Bay, Cardiff. She grew up in the nearby community of Splott. Her father was Nigerian, and her English mother came from New Marske, North Yorkshire.\nTwo of her mother's four children from previous relationships lived in the Bassey household. Bassey's mother listed her first husband, Alfred Metcalfe, as her own father in the registry of her marriage to Henry Bassey, giving rise to speculation that this marriage was bigamous in the absence of a prior divorce. Eliza and Henry's second child died in infancy, so Shirley was born into a household of three sisters, two half-sisters, and one brother.\nTeachers and students alike at Moorland Road School noticed Bassey's strong voice but gave the pre-teen little encouragement: \"everyone told me to shut up. Even in the school choir the teacher kept telling me to back off till I was singing in the corridor!\" A classmate recalled her singing the refrain \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\" from \"Show Boat\" with such feeling that she made their teacher uncomfortable. She left Splott secondary modern school at age 14 to work at Curran Steels and, in the evenings and weekends, to sing in local pubs and clubs.\nCareer.\n1950s.\nIn 1953, Bassey signed her first professional contract, touring with the variety show \"Memories of Jolson\", a musical based on the life of Al Jolson. On 17 December 1953, Bassey signed a contract with Columbia Productions for two performances at the salary of \u00a310. Her next professional engagement was in the touring show \"Hot from Harlem\", in which she and other mixed-race Cardiff performers played Black Americans in 1954. A review of the show in March 1954 included: \"Shirley Bassey, an attractive young singer, is an asset to the show.\" Later that year, Bassey gave birth to her daughter Sharon, while staying with her sister Ella in London.\nWhile performing in Jersey, Bassey met her first manager, Mike Sullivan. In 1955, Bassey toured various theatres until she was noticed by the impresario Jack Hylton at the Astor Club in September 1955. He invited her to feature in Al Read's \"Such Is Life\", which opened on 14 December 1955 at the Adelphi Theatre in London's West End. In the show, which ran until 3 November 1956, she featured the song \"Burn My Candle\", leading one reviewer to say that she had nearly stopped the show with the song \"which brought outraged mutters, then roars of shamefaced applause.\" During the show's run, Philips record producer Johnny Franz spotted her on television, was impressed, and offered her a recording deal. Bassey recorded her first single, \"Burn My Candle\", the song she had featured in \"Such is Life\", and this was released in February 1956. The cabaret-style song was banned by the BBC because the lyrics were considered too suggestive. More singles followed, and in February 1957, Bassey had her first hit with \"The Banana Boat Song\", which reached No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart.\nFollowing a successful run at the Caf\u00e9 de Paris, London, Bassey made her American stage d\u00e9but in Las Vegas at El Rancho Vegas in February 1957. Following on from Las Vegas, Bassey opened at Ciro's on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood on 15 February 1957. She also recorded under the direction of American producer Mitch Miller in New York City for the Columbia Records label (which at the time had a distribution deal with Philips), producing the single \"If I Had a Needle and Thread\" b/w \"Tonight My Heart She Is Crying\". On her return to the UK in April 1957, she starred in \"Sunday Night at the London Palladium\" for the first time on 28 April 1957.\nIn mid-1958, Bassey recorded two singles that would become classics in the Bassey catalogue. \"As I Love You\" was released as the B-side of another ballad, \"Hands Across the Sea\"; it did not sell well at first but, after another appearance at the London Palladium on 30 November, sales began to pick up. In January 1959, \"As I Love You\" reached number-one and stayed there for four weeks; it was the first number-one single by a Welsh artist. While \"As I Love You\" climbed the charts, so did Bassey's recording of \"Kiss Me, Honey Honey, Kiss Me\" and both records would end up occupying the top 3 at the same time. Having been with Decca Records for four years, Bassey then signed to EMI's Columbia label on 20 April 1959. Her first album for Columbia, \"The Fabulous Shirley Bassey\", was later released and reached. No. 12 on the UK Albums Chart.\n1960s.\nBetween 1960 and 1961, Bassey had four Top 10 hits in the UK. Her 1960 recording of \"As Long As He Needs Me\" from Lionel Bart's \"Oliver!\" peaked at No. 2, and had a chart run of 30 weeks. She made her American television d\u00e9but on 13 November 1960, when she performed on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". In 1961, the double A-side \"Reach for the Stars\"/\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\" reached number-one. Bassey's version of \"As Long as He Needs Me\" reached No. 2. Her single \"I'll Get By\" peaked at No. 10. Bassey's rendition of \"You'll Never Know\" was one of the UK's top hits in 1961, reaching No. 6 on the charts. She began to gain recognition in the American market and signed to United Artists Records in August 1961. The following month she began a five-week engagement at the Persian Room inside New York's Plaza Hotel.\nBassey's collaboration with Nelson Riddle and his orchestra, the album \"Let's Face the Music\" (1962), reached No. 12 in the UK album chart; and the single, \"What Now My Love\" made it to No. 5 in 1962. Her cover version of the Ben E. King hit \"I (Who Have Nothing)\" reached No. 6 in 1963. In January 1963, Bassey performed at a gala commemorating the second anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's inauguration in Washington, D.C. In March 1963, she appeared on the cover of \"Ebony\" magazine. Bassey made her Carnegie Hall debut on 15 February 1964. The complete concert recording was not released until it was included in the EMI compilation \"The EMI/UA Years 1959\u20131979\" in 1994.\nIn 1965, Bassey enjoyed her only Top 40 hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 with the title song of the James Bond film, \"Goldfinger\". The single \"Goldfinger\" was released in the US in January 1965, peaking at No 8. The original soundtrack for \"Goldfinger\" hit number-one in the US that year. The \"Goldfinger\" theme song had a lasting impact on her career. In the sleeve notes for Bassey's \"25th Anniversary Album\" (1978), Peter Clayton noted that: \"Acceptance in America was considerably helped by the enormous popularity of (\"Goldfinger\")...But she had actually established herself there as early as 1961, in cabaret in New York. She was also a success in Las Vegas...'I suppose I should feel hurt that I've never been really big in America on record since \"Goldfinger\"...But, concertwise, I always sell out.'...\"\nHer live 1965 album \"Shirley Bassey at the Pigalle\", recorded during a sold-out run at the Pigalle in London, peaked at No. 15 on the UK album chart. Also in 1965, she sang the title song for the James Bond spoof \"The Liquidator.\" Bassey recorded a song for the next Bond film, \"Thunderball\" (1965). \"Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" was not used in the movie, although the film's score follows its melodic theme. Written by John Barry and Leslie Bricusse, \"Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" was re-recorded by American singer Dionne Warwick, and then rejected in favor of a new song, \"Thunderball\", hastily written by Barry and given to Welsh singer Tom Jones after the film's producers decided the song over the opening credits must feature the film's title.\nIn the aftermath of \"Goldfinger\" her UK sales started to falter as well: only two of her singles would enter the UK top 40 from 1966 to 1970. Her first album on United Artists, \"I've Got a Song for You\" (1966), spent one week on the chart. From 1966 to 1970, only two albums would chart, one of those a compilation. One of her best-known singles, \"Big Spender\" was released in 1967, charting just short of the UK top 20.\nBassey began to live as a tax exile in 1968, during a period of very high income tax, and was unable to work in Britain for almost two years. In 1969, she appeared in NBC's \"The Spring Thing,\" a musical television special hosted by Bobbie Gentry and Noel Harrison. Guests included were Goldie Hawn, Meredith MacRae, Irwin C. Watson, Rod McKuen, and Harpers Bizarre.\n1970s.\nBassey's UK comeback came in 1970 leading to one of the most successful periods of her career. Starting the year with a BBC Television 'Special', \"The Young Generation Meet Shirley Bassey\", recorded in Sweden and shown on BBC1 on 18 March. She returned to the UK with a record-breaking run of performances at the Talk of the Town nightclub. Also in 1970, she released the album \"Something\", which marked a stylistic shift for her, as producer/arranger Johnny Harris built on her traditional pop roots by incorporating more contemporary material and arrangements. The title single became one of her biggest UK hits, reaching No. 4 (the same peak as the Beatles\u2019 version) and staying on the charts for 22 weeks \u2013 one of her longest chart runs. However, Bassey continued to record standards, show tunes, and torch songs throughout her career.\nHer song \"Something\" was also a top 10 US hit on the Adult Contemporary chart. Other singles of this period included the hit \"Never Never Never\", an English version of the Italian \"Grande grande grande\", reaching the top 10 in the US Adult Contemporary Chart, the UK top 10 and number one in Australia and South Africa. In 1972, \"For All We Know\" won The Best Female Performance Of The Year at The Radio Luxembourg Awards.\nReturning to the James Bond franchise, she recorded the theme song for \"Diamonds Are Forever\" (1971). Bassey appeared on the \"Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show\", broadcast on Christmas Day in 1971.\nBassey was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" on two occasions: firstly, in November 1972 when Eamonn Andrews 'surprised' her at Heathrow Airport, and then in January 1993, when Michael Aspel surprised her at the curtain call of a sell-out concert at the Royal Albert Hall.\nBassey recorded a series of successful albums on the United Artists label, including: \"Something Else\" (1971); \"And I Love You So\" (1972); \"I Capricorn\" (1972); \"Never Never Never\" (1973); \"Good, Bad but Beautiful\" (1975); \"Love, Life and Feelings\" (1976); \"You Take My Heart Away\" (1977) and \"Yesterdays\" (1978). Additionally, two of Bassey's earlier LPs also entered the charts in the '70s: \"And We Were Lovers\" (1967, re-issued as \"Big Spender\"), and \"Let's Face the Music\" (1962, re-issued as \"What Now My Love\"). Two compilations, \"The Shirley Bassey Singles Album\" (1975) and \"25th Anniversary Album\" (1978), both made the top three of the UK charts: \"The Shirley Bassey Singles Album\", her highest-charting album, reached number two and earned a gold disc, and the \"25th Anniversary Album\" eventually went platinum.\nBetween 1970 and 1979, Bassey had 18 hit albums in the UK Albums Chart. Her album \"The Magic Is You\" (1979) featured a portrait by the photographer Francesco Scavullo. In 1973, her sold-out concerts at New York's Carnegie Hall were recorded and released as a two-LP set, \"Shirley Bassey: Live at Carnegie Hall\"; this album reached No. 20 on the Billboard R&amp;B album chart.\nIn 1976, Bassey starred in the six-episode \"Shirley Bassey\" show, the first of her television programmes for the BBC, followed by a second series of six episodes in 1979. The final show of the first series was nominated for the Golden Rose of Montreux in 1977. The series featured guests including Neil Diamond, Michel Legrand, The Three Degrees and Dusty Springfield and featured Bassey in various international locations as well as in the television studio. In 1978, Bassey pleaded guilty to being drunk and disorderly \"after shouting abuse in the street and pushing a policeman\". In 1979, Bassey recorded the title theme song for the Bond film, \"Moonraker\".\n1980s.\nThroughout most of the 1980s, Bassey focused on charitable work and performing occasional concert tours throughout Europe, Australia, and the United States. She had ended her contract with United Artists, whose former record division was now part of EMI, and began what she referred to as \"semi-retirement\". Bassey recorded an album entitled \"All by Myself\" (1982) and made a TV special for Thames Television called \"A Special Lady\" with guest Robert Goulet. Around this time she recorded a duet with the French film actor Alain Delon, \"Thought I'd Ring You\" (1983). Bassey was now recording far less often but an album of her most famous songs, \"I Am What I Am\" (1984), was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) conducted by Carl Davis. This was followed by a single and video to support the London Tourist Board, \"There's No Place Like London\" (1986), which was co-written by Lynsey de Paul and Gerard Kenny. She recorded an album of James Bond themes, \"The Bond Collection\" in 1987, but was apparently unhappy with the results so she declined to release it. (Five years later it was released anyway, Bassey sued in court, and all unsold copies were withdrawn.)\nBassey provided vocals for Swiss artists Yello on \"The Rhythm Divine\" (1987), a song co-written by Scottish singer Billy Mackenzie. An album sung entirely in Spanish, \"La Mujer\" was released in 1989.\n1990s.\nBassey had started working with a vocal coach, a former opera singer, and her album \"Keep the Music Playing\" (1991) displayed a grand, operatic pop style on several songs (perhaps also influenced by her album with the LSO seven years earlier).\nEMI released the five-CD box set \"Bassey \u2013 The EMI/UA Years 1959\u20131979\" in 1994. The accompanying booklet opened with a poem by Marc Almond. Bassey collaborated with Chris Rea in the film \"La Passione\" (1996), appearing in the film as herself and releasing the single \"'Disco' La Passione\". The remix of this single charted just outside the UK top 40. Bassey's \"History Repeating\" (1997), written for her by the Propellerheads, reached number one on the UK Dance Chart, and number 10 on the US Dance Chart. The liner notes of the Propellerheads' album \"Decksandrumsandrockandroll\" included the lines: \"We would like to extend our maximum respect to Shirley Bassey for honouring us with her performance. We are still in shock...\" Bassey celebrated her 60th birthday in 1997 with two open-air concerts, at Castle Howard and Althorp Park, and another TV special.

Bassey played the Friday night at Henley Festival in 1984.\nBassey was sued in a breach of contract case in 1998 by her former personal assistant, who also accused Bassey of hitting her and making an ethnic slur. Bassey won the case. The episode was lampooned by Alexander Baron in his one-act play \"The Trial of Shirley Bassey\". The following year, she performed the official song for the rugby World Cup, \"World in Union\", with Bryn Terfel at the opening ceremony at The Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, wearing a gown based on the Welsh flag.

{"id": "47151", "revid": "32589484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47151", "title": "Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson", "text": "American author (born 1941)\nJeffrey Moussaieff Masson (; born March 28, 1941, as Jeffrey Lloyd Masson) is an American author. Masson is best known for his conclusions about Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis. In his \"The Assault on Truth\" (1984), Masson argues that Freud may have abandoned his seduction theory because he feared that granting the truth of his female patients' claims that they had been sexually abused as children would hinder the acceptance of his psychoanalytic methods. Masson is a veganism advocate and has written about animal rights.\nEarly life.\nJeffrey Masson is the son of Jacques Masson, a Frenchman of Bukharian Jewish ancestry, and Diana (Dina) Zeiger from an Ashkenazi Orthodox Jewish family. Masson's great-grandfather Shlomo Moussaieff was a kabbalist and founder of the Bukharian Quarter in Jerusalem. His grandfather Henry Mousaieff changed his family name from Moussaieff to Masson. Masson changed his middle name from Lloyd to Moussaieff.\nBoth of his parents were followers of the guru Paul Brunton. Masson's mother later became a follower of mystic and philosopher John Levy. During the 1940s and 1950s, Brunton often lived with them, eventually designating Masson as his heir apparent. In 1956, Diana and Jacques Masson moved to Uruguay because Brunton believed that a third world war was imminent. Jeffrey and his sister Linda followed in 1959.\nStudies.\nAt Brunton's urging, Masson went to Harvard University to study Sanskrit. While at Harvard, Masson became disillusioned with Brunton. Brunton and his influence on the Masson family form the subject of Masson's autobiographical book \"My Father's Guru: A Journey Through Spirituality and Disillusion\". Harvard University granted Masson a B.A. magna cum laude in 1964 and a PhD with Honors in 1970. His degrees were in Sanskrit and Indian Studies. While undertaking his PhD, Masson also studied, supported by fellowships, at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, the University of Calcutta, and the University of Poona.\nCareer.\nMasson taught Sanskrit and Indian Studies at the University of Toronto, 1969\u201380, reaching the rank of Professor. He has also held short term appointments at Brown University, the University of California, and the University of Michigan. From 1981 to 1992, he was a Research Associate, Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies, at the University of California, Berkeley. He was an Honorary Fellow in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.\nViews on Freud's seduction theory.\nIn 1970, Masson began studying to become a psychoanalyst at the Toronto Psychoanalytic Institute, completing a full clinical training course in 1978. His training analyst was Irvine Schiffer, a well-known Toronto analyst and author of books on the unconscious aspects of charisma and time. In 1990 Masson published an autobiographical book in which he accused Schiffer of cursing, being constantly late for sessions, and intimidating Masson when the latter complained about this issue. Schiffer denied it and debated Masson on the Canadian television program \"The Fifth Estate\".\nDuring this time, Masson befriended the psychoanalyst Kurt Eissler and became acquainted with Sigmund Freud's daughter Anna Freud. Eissler designated Masson to succeed him as Director of the Sigmund Freud Archives after his and Anna Freud's deaths. Masson learned German and studied the history of psychoanalysis. In 1980 Masson was appointed Projects Director of the Freud Archives, with full access to Freud's correspondence and other unpublished papers. While perusing this material, Masson concluded that Freud might have rejected the seduction theory in order to advance the cause of psychoanalysis and to maintain his own place within the psychoanalytic inner circle, after a hostile response from the renowned sex-pathologist Richard von Krafft-Ebing and the rest of the Vienna Psychiatric Society in 1896 \u2014 \"an icy reception from the jackasses,\" was the way Freud described it later to Fliess.\nIn 1981, Masson's controversial conclusions were discussed in a series of \"New York Times\" articles by Ralph Blumenthal, to the dismay of the psychoanalytic establishment. Masson was subsequently dismissed from his position as project director of the Freud Archives and stripped of his membership in psychoanalytic professional societies. Masson was defended by Alice Miller\nand Muriel Gardiner (\"While striving not to take sides,\" Gardiner said, \"I consider him a good and energetic worker and a worthwhile scholar\").\nMasson later wrote several books critical of psychoanalysis, including \"The Assault on Truth: Freud's Suppression of the Seduction Theory\". In the introduction to \"The Assault on Truth\", Masson challenged his critics to address his arguments: \"My pessimistic conclusions may possibly be wrong. The documents may in fact allow a very different reading.\" Janet Malcolm interviewed Masson at length when writing her long \"New Yorker\" article on this controversy, which she later expanded into \"In the Freud Archives\", a book that also dealt with Eissler and with Peter Swales.\nIn 1984 Masson sued \"The New Yorker,\" Janet Malcolm, and the publisher Alfred A. Knopf for defamation, claiming that Malcolm had misquoted him. The ensuing trial drew considerable attention. The U.S. district court ruled against Masson. In 1989 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco upheld the lower court's decision. \"The Court of Appeals affirmed ... that Malcolm had deliberately altered each quotation not found on the tape recordings, but nevertheless held that petitioner failed to raise a jury question of actual malice.\" Masson petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court, which reversed the Court of Appeals decision and sent the case back to trial by jury. The decade-long ten-million-dollar federal lawsuit came to a close in 1994 when the jury and the court again ruled in \"The New Yorker\"'s favor. Subsequent to the case, Janet Malcolm claimed to have found her handwritten notes indicating that Masson had lied in relation to the remaining disputed quotations, as he had lied in relation to quotations where there were recordings.\nMeanwhile, in 1985, Masson edited and translated Freud's complete correspondence with Wilhelm Fliess after having convinced Anna Freud to make it available in full. He also looked up the original places and documents in La Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital in Paris, where Freud had studied with Charcot. Masson writes that the scientific community has been largely silent about his views, and that he suffered personal attacks once he deviated from the traditional views on the seduction theory and the history of psychoanalysis. Both the traditional view and Masson's case against it are built on the account that Freud's seduction theory patients reported having been sexually abused in early childhood; several Freud scholars have disputed this account.\nLater work.\nSince the early 1990s, Masson has written a number of books on the emotional life of animals, one of which, \"When Elephants Weep\", has been translated into 20 languages. He has explained this radical change in the subject of his writings as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I'd written a whole series of books about psychiatry, and nobody bought them. Nobody liked them. Nobody. Psychiatrists hated them, and they were much too abstruse for the general public. It was very hard to make a living, and I thought, \"As long as I'm not making a living, I may as well write about something I really love: animals.\"\nIn 2008, Masson became a Director of Voiceless, the animal protection institute. \"We are not encouraged, on a daily basis, to pay careful attention to the animals we eat. On the contrary, the meat, dairy, and egg industries all actively encourage us to give thought to our own immediate interest (taste, for example, or cheap food) but not to the real suffering involved... The animals involved suffer agony because of our ignorance. The least we owe them is to lessen that ignorance\".\nMasson also wrote a book about living in New Zealand, which includes an interview with Sir Edmund Hillary.\nPersonal life.\nMasson is married to Leila Masson, a German pediatrician. They have two sons. He also has a daughter by a previous marriage with Therese Claire Masson. In the early 1990s, Masson had been engaged to University of Michigan feminist legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon, who wrote the preface to his \"A Dark Science: Women, Sexuality, and Psychiatry in the Nineteenth Century\".\nMasson became a vegan in 2004. He is an animal rights activist.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nInterviews"}

Four of the five games featured duels between future Hall of Fame pitchers. The games were the second edition of the World Series after the initial meeting in 1903, since the 1904 season ended with no Series held, and the first to be officially sanctioned by the leagues and the National Baseball Commission.\nGames 1 and 3 were played in Philadelphia; games 2, 4, 5 in New York.\nEach of the five games was a shutout. Three of those, over a six-day span, were pitched and won by Christy Mathewson.\nSummary.\nBefore the Series began, the Athletics were already at a major disadvantage. For the Series, they were without the services of Rube Waddell, who was arguably their best pitcher that year. The reason for Waddell's absence was listed as a shoulder injury from some sort of 'wrestling match' with teammate Andy Coakley, though in years since some have speculated that Waddell was actually bribed or 'paid off' to fake the injury and thus not play in the Series. Philadelphia manager Connie Mack, however, refused to believe this theory, finding it ridiculous.\nJohn McGraw, the Giants' manager, had previously referred to the Athletics as a \"white elephant\", which the club defiantly adopted as a symbolic mascot. At the conference at home plate before Game 1, A's team captain Lave Cross gave McGraw a wrapped package, which turned out to contain a toy white elephant. McGraw responded with a big grin, and the crowd laughed.[Philadelphia \"Inquirer\", October 10, 2005, p.\u00a010] McGraw and the Giants would have the last laugh, easily defeating the A's in the Series.\n NL New York Giants (4) vs. AL Philadelphia Athletics (1)\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nThe opening game was a pitchers' duel between Christy Mathewson and Eddie Plank. Both got out of jams, shutting the opposing offense down. In the Giants' top of the fifth, Mathewson singled, but was forced by Roger Bresnahan, who stole second shortly afterwards. After George Browne popped out, Mike Donlin singled to left, scoring Bresnahan and advancing Donlin to second. After Dan McGann walked, Sam Mertes doubled, bringing home Donlin. In the Athletics' half of the sixth, Ossee Schreckengost doubled and advanced to third on a wild pitch, but did not score, and was the lone runner to reach third base against Mathewson in the entire series. The Giants added an insurance run in the ninth, when Billy Gilbert scored on Bresnahan's single. This was the first of Mathewson's three complete-game shutouts, a World Series record that may never be matched.\nGame 2.\nThe A's called on Chief Bender to turn the tables on the Giants. His opponent was 21-game winner \"Iron Man\" Joe McGinnity. The game was scoreless until the top of the third. Ossee Schreckengost, leading off, reached on a Dan McGann's error. Bender sacrificed, moving Schreckengost to second. After a groundout by Topsy Hartsel moved Schreckengost to third, Bris Lord singled to left and drove Ossee home with an unearned run. The slim margin held until the top of the eighth, when the A's scored multiple times. With one out, Schreckengost was once again the catalyst, singling to center. After Bender flied out to right field, Hartsel's double scored Schreckengost all the way from first (helped by an error from Bresnahan), and a single by Lord brought Hartsel home, making it 3\u20130 in favor of the A's with all three runs unearned. Bender continued to cruise, got out of late-inning jams and ended up with a complete-game shutout that tied the series at one game each.\nGame 3.\nChristy Mathewson once again took the mound for the Giants in Game 3. Opposing him this time was Andy Coakley, who hit the first batter he faced, Roger Bresnahan, with a pitch. A single to right by Mike Donlin moved Bresnahan to third with one out. Dan McGann singled to right, bringing Bresnahan home. An error by Danny Murphy scored Donlin and put Sam Mertes on base. Bill Dahlen walked, loading the bases with one out, but Art Devlin hit into a double play to end the rally. The Giants put the game away in the top of the fifth. Bresnahan walked with one out. George Browne singled and went to second on the throw to third base. Donlin was walked intentionally, setting up a possible inning-ending double play, but things continued to crumble for Coakley and the A's. McGann reached on another error by Danny Murphy, reloading the bases and scoring a run. Mertes singled, reloading the bases and driving in another run. Bill Dahlen hit into a force play at second, scoring Donlin. After Dahlen stole second, Devlin singled, bringing home McGann and sending Dahlen to third. Devlin then stole second and Dahlen stole home on a double steal, scoring the fifth and last run of the Giants' fifth. They scored two more runs in the top of the ninth, when McGann doubled home Browne and Donlin. Mathewson pitched his second complete-game shutout, giving the Giants a 2\u20131 lead in the series. This was the first 9\u20130 World Series game\u2014the next one occurred when the Cubs shut out the Tigers by that lopsided score in Game 1 in 1945, although Detroit ended up taking that series four games to three.\nGame 4.\nEddie Plank returned for the A's against Joe McGinnity for the Giants in Game 4. Both left men on base in scoring position early on, and kept the game scoreless until the bottom of the fourth, when Sam Mertes led off the inning by reaching on an error by Monte Cross. After Bill Dahlen flied to right Art Devlin grounded out, moving Mertes to second. With two outs, Billy Gilbert singled to left, bringing Mertes home for the only run of the game, McGinnity outdueling Plank 1\u20130 and giving the Giants a three-games-to-one lead.\nGame 5.\nThe Giants looked to wrap up the series behind the perennial Christy Mathewson, who faced Chief Bender this time. The game was scoreless until the bottom of the fifth, when Sam Mertes scored during a bizarre double play involving Bill Dahlen and Billy Gilbert; with one out, Mertes on third, and Dahlen on second, Gilbert hit a sacrifice fly that scored Mertes, but Dahlen was out attempting to advance to third, and this third out was recorded after Mertes had scored. In the eighth, the Giants got an insurance run when Mathewson scored on George Browne's ground out after Roger Bresnahan's double had sent him to third with less than two out. Mathewson then took the mound for the top of the ninth and induced three ground outs, thereby completing arguably the single greatest performance by any player in World Series history with his third complete-game shutout of the series.\nComposite line score.\n1905 World Series (4\u20131): New York Giants (N.L.) over Philadelphia Athletics (A.L.)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Grandson of emperor Charlemagne and the third son of Louis the Pious, emperor of Francia, and his first wife, Ermengarde of Hesbaye, he received the appellation \"Germanicus\" shortly after his death, when East Francia became known as the kingdom of Germany.\nAfter protracted clashes with his father and his brothers, Louis received the East Frankish kingdom in the Treaty of Verdun (843). His attempts to conquer his half-brother Charles the Bald's West Frankish kingdom in 858\u201359 were unsuccessful. The 860s were marked by a severe crisis, with the East Frankish rebellions of the sons, as well as struggles to maintain supremacy over his realm. In the Treaty of Meerssen he acquired Lotharingia for the East Frankish kingdom in 870. On the other hand, he tried and failed to claim both the title of Emperor and Italy. In the East, Louis was able to reach a longer-term peace agreement in 874 after decades of conflict with the Moravians. His rule shows a marked decline in creation of written administration and government documents, a trend that would continue into Ottonian times.\nEarly life.\nHis early years were spent at the courts of his grandfather and father. In 814, when his older brothers Lothair and Pepin were designated to govern Bavaria and Aquitaine, Louis was still very young. In 817, his father, emperor Louis the Pious issued \"Ordinatio Imperii\", and assigned titles and regions to his sons, making Lothair co-emperor, Pepin king in Aquitaine, and Louis king in Bavaria, with additional jurisdiction over Carantania, Bohemia and other dependent Slavs and Avars. Such political solutions were following the practice of emperor Charlemagne of bestowing regional realms to a close family members who would serve as his lieutenants and local governors. \nLouis ruled over Bavaria and its dependencies from Regensburg, the old capital of the Bavarians. Since he was young, during the first several years Louis ruled in assistance with able royal administrators. In 825, he became involved in wars with the Wends and Sorbs on north-eastern frontiers. In 827, he married Hemma, sister of his stepmother Judith of Bavaria, both daughters of count Welf, whose possessions ranged from Alsace to Bavaria. In the same year (827), Bulgarians invaded Pannonia, thus initiating the start of a Frankish\u2013Bulgarian conflict in the region.\nIn 828, the vast Duchy of Friuli was divided into four counties, with Friuli proper and Istria remaining under jurisdiction of Lothair's Italian realm, while Carniola and Lower Pannonia were added to the jurisdiction of Louis' Bavarian realm. At the same time, the question of effective rule over Carantania was also resolved in Louis' favor. Thus, young king of Bavaria became ruler of entire Frankish southeast, which included Bavaria and Carantania with all eastern marches and dependent Avar and Slavic regions throughout Pannonia.\nIn 828 and 829, Louis undertook two campaigns against the Bulgarians who were invading Pannonia, and secured victory by repelling the invaders. During his time as \"Unterk\u00f6nig\" (sub-king), he tried to extend his rule to the Rhine-Main area.\nRebellious son.\nIn 829, the emperor Louis decided to grant Alamannia to his youngest son Charles, thus changing provisions of the 817 succession settlements. A series of dynastic conflicts and wars followed between the emperor and his older sons. Louis of Bavaria became involved reluctantly in the first dynastic conflict that erupted in 830 between his eldest brother Lothair and their father (830), thus allowing him to reconcile with the emperor. In 831, a new succession settlement was imposed by an imperial decree, designating Louis of Bavaria as future inheritor of Thuringia, Saxony, Austrasia, Frisia, and northern portions of Neustria. \nAs early as 832, dynastic conflicts were renewed. Louis invaded Alamannia, which his father had previously given to young Charles, but was driven back by the emperor. Louis the Pious disinherited him, but to no effect, since the conflict escalated during 833 into open war between emperor Louis and all of his older sons. The emperor was soon captured and deposed by Lothair, who tried to impose firm authority over his brothers, and thus already in 834 an open war between brothers broke out. Lothair was forced to retreat and Louis the Pious was reinstated as emperor. Louis of Bavaria made peace with his father and kept Bavaria with extended jurisdiction over several other East Frankish regions.\nLouis instigated another dynastic conflict, which was initiated in 838 by the death of Pepin of Aquitaine and escalated in 839 when emperor Louis imposed new succession settlements favoring Lothair and Charls, while reducing the inheritance of Louis of Bavaria to his Bavarian and adjacent south-eastern regions. A war broke out and Louis of Bavaria again invaded Alamannia and other eastern regions, achieving some initial success. This time, emperor Louis responded quickly, and soon the younger Louis was forced to retreat into Bavaria. Prominent nobles tried to reconcile father and son, but the old emperor remained reluctant and bitter until his death in 840.\nDynastic war and aftermath, 840\u2013843.\nWhen the emperor Louis died in 840 and Lothair I claimed the whole Empire, Louis allied with Charles the Bald. He defeated Lothair I's commander, Adalbert of Metz, at the battle of the Ries on 13 May 841. A few weeks later, Louis and Charles defeated Lothair and their nephew Pepin II of Aquitaine at the Battle of Fontenoy on 25 June. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. According to the Annals of Fulda, it was the biggest bloodbath the Franks had experienced from time immemorial. At the same time, it was Louis's last battle in the struggle for the unification of the kingdom.\nIn June 842, the three brothers met on an island in the river Sa\u00f4ne to negotiate a peace and each appointed forty representatives to arrange the boundaries of their respective kingdoms. This developed into the Treaty of Verdun, concluded by 10 August 843, under which Louis received the bulk of the lands lying east of the Rhine (East Francia), together with a district around Speyer, Worms, and Mainz on the left bank of the river (see also Oaths of Strasbourg 842). His territories included Bavaria (where he made Regensburg the seat of his government), Thuringia, Franconia, and Saxony.\nLouis may be called the founder of the German kingdom, though his attempts to maintain the unity of the Empire proved futile. Having crushed the \"Stellinga\" rising in Saxony in 842, he compelled the Obotrites to accept his authority in 844 and put their prince, Gozzmovil, to death. Thachulf, Duke of Thuringia, then undertook campaigns against the Bohemians, Moravians, and other tribes, but was not very successful in resisting the ravaging Vikings.\nConflicts with Charles the Bald.\nIn 852 Louis sent his son Louis the Younger to Aquitaine, where nobles had grown resentful of Charles the Bald's rule. The younger Louis did not set out until 854, and returned the following year.\nStarting in 853, Louis made repeated attempts to gain the throne of West Francia, which, according to the \"Annals of Fulda\" (\"Annales Fuldenses\"), the people of that country offered him in their disgust with the cruel misrule of Charles the Bald. Encouraged by his nephews Peppin II and Charles of Provence, Louis invaded West Francia in 858. Charles the Bald could not even raise an army to resist the invasion and fled to Burgundy. Later that year, Louis issued a charter dated \"the first year of the reign in West Francia.\" However, treachery and desertion in his army, and the continued loyalty of the Aquitanian bishops to Charles the Bald, brought about the failure of the whole enterprise. As such, both Louis and Charles made public vows to uphold the peace on 7 June 860 at Koblenz.\nAfter the emperor Lothair I died in 855, Louis and Charles for a time cooperated in plans to divide Lothair's possessions between themselves, the only impediments to this being Lothair's sons and heirs\u2014Lothair II (who received Lotharingia), Louis II of Italy (who held the imperial title and the Iron Crown of Lombardy) and Charles of Provence. In 868 at Metz, Louis and Charles agreed to partition Lotharingia. When Lothair II died in 869, Louis was lying seriously ill and his armies were engaged in a war with the Moravians. Charles the Bald quickly seized Lothair's lands, but Louis, having recovered, compelled him by threat of war to agree to the Treaty of Meerssen, which divided Lothair's lands among all the claimants.\n\"Divisio regni\" among the sons.\nThe later years of Louis the German were troubled by rebellions of his sons. The eldest, Carloman of Bavaria, revolted in 861 and again two years later. This was followed by the second son Louis the Younger, who was joined by his brother Charles the Fat. In 864 Louis was forced to grant Carloman the kingdom of Bavaria, which he himself had once held under his father. In 865 he divided the remainder of his lands\u2014Saxony with Franconia and Thuringia went to Louis the Younger and Swabia with Raetia to Charles the Fat.\nIn May 868, Louis convoked a synod at Worms to deal with the aftermath of the Photian schism and to get the church's support against Moravia.\nA report that the Emperor Louis II had died in Italy led to a peace between father and sons and attempts by Louis the German to gain the imperial crown for his oldest son Carloman. These efforts were thwarted by Louis II, who was in fact not dead, and Louis' old adversary, Charles the Bald.\nLater life.\nIn the years 872 and 873, ambassadors from the Eastern Roman Emperor Basil I came to Louis in Regensburg, showing that his rule was perceived as far as Constantinople. After the death of Emperor Louis II in August 875, Louis tried to win the emperorship for himself and his descendants. To this end, Abbot Sigihard von Fulda undertook a trip to Rome to Pope John VIII. On 18 May 876, he returned to Ingelheim and reported to Louis that, in December 875, Charles the Bald had been able to obtain the title of emperor by a swift move to Rome.\nHis wife Hemma visited Louis for the last time in May 875. In 874 she had lost her voice as a result of a stroke. During his stay, he donated the Berg im Donaugau Abbey to the Marienkapelle, which he built. Hemma died at the end of January 876 in Regensburg. Louis then died from a stroke on 28 August 876 at his palace in Frankfurt. The following day he was buried by his son Louis in Lorsch Abbey. According to Wilfried Hartmann, it cannot be determined with certainty whether the dead man in his sarcophagus is the Carolingian king. After Louis' death, Charles the Bald tried to win over the eastern kingdom as well. However, Louis the Younger defeated him on 8 October 876 at Andernach with a force of Franks, Saxons and Thuringians. One year later, Charles the Bald died as well.\nLouis' residence.\nAs there exist only 172 royal documents from 59 years of his reign as first the King of Bavaria and later the King of East Francia, it is impossible to construct a detailed picture of Louis' whereabouts in the East Frankish kingdom. By comparison, Louis the Pious had 18 certificates created per year, and his half-brother Charles the Bald had 12 produced annually. This pattern of not producing many documents lasts for several months at certain times. For example, it is completely uncertain where the East Frankish king stayed between June 849 and July 850. At least 52 documents are addressed to Bavarian beneficiaries. However, the intensity of the documentary production for Bavarian recipients steadily decreased during his reign.\nAs a stem duchy, the Rhine-Main area contained Frankfurt, Mainz and Worms, and had plenty of imperial palaces and treasuries. Since it was located in the geographic centre of the East Frankish kingdom, it was easily accessible by road. As a result, it was the region that hosted most East Frankish synods and imperial assemblies.\nNickname \"the German\".\nLouis was only nicknamed \"the German\" in the 18th century. Contemporary West Frankish sources called Louis \"rex Germaniae\" (\"King of Germania\") or \"rex Germanorum\" (\"King of the Teutons\"). However, in this context, Germania or Germani does not mean \"Germany\" or \"the Germans\", but, as in ancient Latin, the area on the right bank of the Rhine outside the former Roman Empire and its inhabitants. Contemporaries gave Louis the epithet \"pius\" (pious) or \"piissimus\" (very pious). The contemporary coinage called him \"HLUDOVICUS PIUS REX\".\nMarriage and children.\nLouis was married to Hemma (died 31 January 876), and they had:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47154", "revid": "39079878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47154", "title": "Ivor Novello", "text": "Welsh composer and actor (1893\u20131951)\nIvor Novello (born David Ivor Davies; 15 January 1893 \u2013 6 March 1951) was a Welsh actor, dramatist, singer and composer who became one of the most popular British entertainers of the first half of the 20th century.\nHe was born into a musical family, and his first successes were as a songwriter. His first big hit was \"Keep the Home Fires Burning\" (1914), which was enormously popular during the First World War. His 1917 show, \"Theodore &amp; Co\", was a wartime hit. After the war, Novello contributed numbers to several successful musical comedies and was eventually commissioned to write the scores of complete shows. He wrote his musicals in the style of operetta and often composed his music to the libretti of Christopher Hassall.\nIn the 1920s he turned to acting, first in British films and then on stage, with considerable success in both. He starred in two silent films directed by Alfred Hitchcock, \"\" and \"Downhill\" (both 1927). On stage, he played the title character in the first London production of \"Liliom\" (1926). Novello briefly went to Hollywood but soon returned to Britain, where he had more successes, especially on stage, appearing in his own lavish West End productions of musicals. The best-known of these were \"Glamorous Night\" (1935) and \"The Dancing Years\" (1939).\nFrom the 1930s he often performed with Zena Dare, writing parts for her in his works. He continued to write for film, but in his later career his biggest successes were with stage musicals: \"Perchance to Dream\" (1945), \"King's Rhapsody\" (1949) and \"Gay's the Word\" (1951).\nThe Ivor Novello Awards were named after him in 1955.\nEarly years.\nNovello was born David Ivor Davies in Cardiff, Wales, to David Davies (c. 1852\u20131931), a rent collector for the city council, and his wife, Clara Novello Davies, an internationally known singing teacher and choral conductor. As a boy, Novello was a successful singer in the Welsh Eisteddfod. His mother set up as a voice teacher in London, where he met leading performers, including members of George Edwardes's Gaiety Theatre company, classical musicians such as Landon Ronald, and singers such as Adelina Patti. Another of his mother's associates was Clara Butt, who taught him to sing \"Abide with Me\" when he was a boy of six.\nNovello was educated privately in Cardiff and then in Gloucester, where he studied harmony and counterpoint with Herbert Brewer, the cathedral organist. From there he won a scholarship to Magdalen College School in Oxford, where he was a solo treble in the college choir. He later said that this prolonged youthful exposure to early sacred choral music had turned his tastes, in reaction, to lush romantic music. Although Brewer had told him he would not have a career in music, Novello from his early youth showed a facility for writing songs, and when he was only 15, one of his songs was published. After leaving school, he gave piano lessons in Cardiff, and then moved to London in 1913 with his mother. They took a flat above the Strand Theatre, which became his London home for the rest of his life.\nIn London he found a mentor in Sir Edward Marsh, a well-known patron of the arts and Winston Churchill's secretary. Marsh encouraged him to compose and introduced him to people who could help his career. He adopted his mother's middle name, \"Novello\", as his professional surname, although he did not change it legally until 1927.\nIn 1914, at the start of the First World War, Novello wrote \"Keep the Home Fires Burning\", a song that expressed the feelings of innumerable families sundered by the war. Novello composed the music for the song to a lyric by the American Lena Guilbert Ford, and it became a huge popular success, bringing Novello money and fame at the age of 21. In other respects, the war had less impact on Novello than on many young men of his age. He avoided enlistment until June 1916, when he reported to a Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) training depot as a probationary flight sub-lieutenant. After Novello twice crashed aeroplanes, Marsh arranged his move to the Admiralty office in central London for the rest of the war.\nComposer and actor.\nNovello continued to write songs while serving in the RNAS. He had his first stage success with \"Theodore &amp; Co\" in 1916, a production by George Grossmith Jr. and Edward Laurillard with a score composed by Novello and the young Jerome Kern. In the same year, Novello contributed to Andr\u00e9 Charlot's revue \"See-Saw\". In 1917 he wrote for another Grossmith and Laurillard production, the operetta \"Arlette\", for which he contributed additional numbers to an existing French score by Jane Vieu and Guy le Feuvre. In the same year, Marsh introduced him to the actor Bobbie Andrews, who became Novello's life partner. Andrews introduced Novello to the young No\u00ebl Coward. Coward, six years Novello's junior, was deeply envious of Novello's effortless glamour. He wrote, \"I just felt suddenly conscious of the long way I had to go before I could break into the magic atmosphere in which he moved and breathed with such nonchalance\".\nIn 1918 and after the war, Novello continued to write successfully for musical comedy and revue. The former included \"Who's Hooper?\" (1919), an adaptation of a Pinero play, with a book by Fred Thompson, lyrics by Clifford Grey, and music by Howard Talbot and Novello, and \"The Golden Moth\" by Thompson and P. G. Wodehouse (1921), for which Novello provided the entire score. For Charlot, he contributed numbers to the revues \"Tabs\" (1918), \"A to Z\" (1921) and \"Puppets\" (1924). For the second of these, his songs included one of his few well-known comedy numbers, \"And Her Mother Came Too\", with lyrics by Dion Titheradge, written for Jack Buchanan.\nAt the same time as his successes as a composer, Novello was making a career as an actor. With \"a classic profile that gained him matinee idol status amongst the film-going public\", he was sought out, on the strength of a publicity photograph, by the Swiss film director Louis Mercanton. Mercanton offered him a silent-film role as the romantic lead in \"The Call of the Blood\" (1920). In the same year, he made another film for Mercanton, \"Miarka\". Novello made his first British film, \"Carnival\", the following year.\nNovello made his stage debut in 1921 in \"Deburau\" by Sacha Guitry, and, among other stage engagements in the next years, he played Bingley in a charity adaptation of \"Pride and Prejudice\". At about this time, Novello had an affair with the writer Siegfried Sassoon; it was short-lived, but in the words of Sassoon's biographer John Stuart Roberts, Novello \"was a consummate flirt who collected lovers as he gathered lilacs\".\nIn 1923, Novello made his American movie debut in D. W. Griffith's \"The White Rose\", and the same year he starred in \"The Man Without Desire\", among other British films. He next co-wrote, produced and starred in the successful 1924 play \"The Rat\". The play was made into a film in 1925, which was so successful that two sequels followed in 1926 and 1928. His dramatic roles in the West End included the title character in the first London production of Ferenc Moln\u00e1r's \"Liliom\" (1926).\nOther films in which Novello starred included Alfred Hitchcock's \"\", where he played the title character, and \"Downhill\" (both in 1927). The British film company Gainsborough Pictures offered Novello a lucrative contract, which enabled him to buy a country house in Littlewick Green, near Maidenhead. He renamed the property 'Redroofs', and he entertained there famously and with little regard for convention. Cecil Beaton, noting the frequent homosexual excesses, coined the phrase, \"the Ivor \u2013 Noel naughty set\". Coward had by now caught up to Novello professionally, despite a joint disaster when Novello starred in Coward's play \"Sirocco\" in 1927, which was a d\u00e9b\u00e2cle, and closed within a month of opening. In 1928 Novello starred in the silent adaptation of Coward's much more successful \"The Vortex\", and made his last silent film, \"A South Sea Bubble\". During the late 1920s Novello was the most popular male British film star, and was often dubbed Britain's \"handsomest screen actor\".\nNovello returned to composing for the lyric stage in 1929, writing eight numbers for the revue \"The House that Jack Built\". In the same year, he presented his own play \"Symphony in Two Flats\", which he took to New York the following year. It was followed by a successful Broadway production of his \"The Truth Game\", which brought him to the attention of Hollywood studios. He accepted a contract to write for and appear in MGM films. He found little to do in Hollywood, however, beyond writing the dialogue for \"Tarzan the Ape Man\". Returning to London, he starred in the sound remake of \"The Lodger\" (1932).\n1930s musicals.\nAfter beginning the 1930s with a series of non-musical plays \u2013 \"I Lived with You\" (1932), \"Fresh Fields\", \"Proscenium\", \"Sunshine Sisters\", \"Flies in the Sun\" (all 1933) and \"Murder in Mayfair\" (1934) \u2013 Novello returned to composition in 1935 with \"Glamorous Night\", which was the first of a series of enormously popular musicals. \"The Times\" considered that it was for these that Novello would be popularly remembered. Paul Webb, in the \"Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\", writes that Novello's show saved the fortunes of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Dominating the British musical theatre from the mid-1930s to the early 1950s, his shows were heavily influenced by the operettas that he had grown up with (he saw \"Die lustige Witwe\" 27 times), but had a highly individual style of their own. Blending musicals with opera, operetta and both modern and classical dance, these shows were considered something of an anachronism in their own time, but that was part of their appeal.\nAnother model was Coward's 1929 musical \"Bitter Sweet\", which Novello called \"a \"lovely\", lovely thing ... sheer joy from beginning to end\". That, too, was an old-fashioned musical, \"so full of regret ... for a vanished kindly silly darling age\".\nFor all his four 1930s musicals, Novello wrote the book and music, Christopher Hassall wrote the lyrics, and the orchestrations were by Charles Prentice. \"Glamorous Night\" starred Novello and Mary Ellis, with a cast including Zena Dare, Olive Gilbert and Elizabeth Welch, and ran from 2 May 1935 to 18 July 1936, at Drury Lane and then the London Coliseum. \"Careless Rapture\" ran from 11 September 1936 for 296 performances, with Novello, Dorothy Dickson and Zena Dare in the leading roles. \"Crest of the Wave\" starred Novello, Dickson and Gilbert, and ran from 1 September 1937 for 203 performances. The last of Novello's prewar musicals was \"The Dancing Years\", which starred Novello, Ellis and Gilbert, opened at Drury Lane, closed on the outbreak of the Second World War, toured and then reopened at the Adelphi Theatre, running in the West End for a combined total of 696 performances and closing on 8 July 1944. This show was the closest Novello came to fulfilling his mother's early ambitions for him to write operas; he played an Austrian composer-conductor at the Wiener Hofoper.\nSecond World War and last years.\nNovello presented only two new shows during the Second World War. \"Arc de Triomphe\" (1943), a musical vehicle for Mary Ellis, was only a modest success, but \"Perchance to Dream\" (1945) was immensely successful, running for 1,022 performances. In between the two shows, Novello had been in serious legal trouble and served four weeks in prison for misuse of petrol coupons, a serious offence under rationing laws in wartime Britain. An admiring fan had stolen the coupons from her employer, but the court found that Novello was also culpable. The prison term, though short, came as a severe shock to Novello, both mentally and physically, and had serious lasting effects. Not everybody was supportive; Coward's sympathy was limited: \"He's been fighting like a steer to keep going as before the war and hasn't done a thing for the general effort\", but when Novello returned to \"The Dancing Years\" after his release, he received \"a rapturous ovation\" on his first entrance.\nNovello's last full-scale production in this style, \"King's Rhapsody\" (1949), was, in Webb's words, \"a self-consciously romantic counter-blast to the modern musical: crown princes, ballrooms, royal yachts, beautiful princesses and a full-scale coronation\". After the rigours of war, this escapist entertainment had strong box-office appeal and ran for 841 performances. The show starred Novello and the cast included Phyllis Dare, Zena Dare, Olive Gilbert and Bobbie Andrews. It was still running, at the Palace Theatre, when Novello's last show opened. This was \"Gay's the Word\" (1951). Novello had written no role for himself; the show starred the comedy actress Cicely Courtneidge and was a departure from his established pattern, balancing the contrasting styles of European operetta and post-war American musicals. \"The Times\" commented that the show \"cheerfully parodied the very Ruritanian romances to which he owed his most triumphant successes\".\nDeath and legacy.\nNovello died suddenly from a coronary thrombosis at the age of 58, a few hours after completing a performance of \"King's Rhapsody\". He was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium, and his ashes are buried beneath a lilac bush and marked with a plaque that reads \"Ivor Novello 6th March 1951 'Till you are home once more'.\" He left an estate worth \u00a3160,000 (\u00a3million in 2023).\nOnly a few weeks before Novello's death, Coward had written of him: \"Theatre \u2013 good, bad and indifferent \u2013 is the love of his life. For him, other human endeavours are mere shadows. ... The reward of his work lies in the indisputable fact that whenever and wherever he appears the vast majority of the British public flock to see him.\" \"The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" writes of Novello that he was \"until the advent of Andrew Lloyd Webber, the 20th century's most consistently successful composer of British musicals\".\nThe Ivor Novello Awards for songwriting, established in 1955 in Novello's memory, are awarded each year by The Ivors Academy (formerly the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA)) to British songwriters and composers as well as to an outstanding international music writer. A scholarship in memory of Novello was established at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and in 1952 a bronze bust of him by Clemence Dane was unveiled at Drury Lane. In St. Paul's, Covent Garden, known as the \"actors' church\", a panel was installed to commemorate Novello, and in 1972, to mark the 21st anniversary of his death, a memorial stone was unveiled in St. Paul's Cathedral.\nIn 1993, the centenary of Novello's birth was marked by several celebratory shows around the UK, including one at the Players' Theatre in London. In 2005, the Strand Theatre, above which Novello lived for many years, was renamed the Novello Theatre, with a plaque in his honour set at the entrance. On 27 June 2009, a statue of Novello was unveiled outside the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay. Plaques detailing some of his best-known songs are fitted to the pedestal, along with a dedication to Novello. Novello's memory is promoted by The Ivor Novello Appreciation Bureau, which holds annual events around Britain, including an annual pilgrimage to Redroofs each June. Redroofs was sold after Novello's death, and is now a theatre training school.\nNovello was portrayed in Robert Altman's 2001 film \"Gosford Park\" by Jeremy Northam, and several of his songs were used for the film's soundtrack, including \"Waltz of My Heart\", \"And Her Mother Came Too\", \"I Can Give You the Starlight\", \"What a Duke Should Be\", \"Why Isn't It You?\" and \"The Land of Might-Have-Been\". Jeremy Irvine played Novello in the 2021 Terence Davies film \"Benediction\", about the life of his one-time lover, the war poet Siegfried Sassoon.\nSongs.\nAmong Novello's well-known songs are \"Keep the Home Fires Burning\", \"Fold Your Wings\", \"Shine Through My Dreams\", \"Rose of England\", \"I Can Give You the Starlight\", \"And Her Mother Came Too\", \"My Dearest Dear\", \"The Land of Might-Have-Been\", \"When I Curtsied to the King\", \"We'll Gather Lilacs\", \"Someday My Heart Will Awake\", \"Yesterday\", \"Waltz of My Heart\", \"Why Isn't It You\", \"My Life Belongs to You\", \"Fly Home Little Heart\", \"Take Your Girl\" and \"Primrose\".\nIn \"Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians\", Webb writes that although Novello's oeuvre is generally thought of as \"romantic\" and \"Ruritanian\", his music \"was far more varied than his current reputation suggests\". Webb contends that such romantic hits as \"Someday My Heart Will Awake\" were balanced by \"rousing operetta choruses ... and jazz age numbers\" while \"'Rose of England' is a stately patriotic piece that stands comparison with Elgar or Walton\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While the exact resources encompassed in the term may vary, it is widely agreed to include the classical factors of production (land, labour, and capital) as well as the general infrastructure and capital goods necessary to reproduce stable levels of productivity. It can also be used as an abbreviation of the \"means of production and distribution\" which additionally includes the logistical distribution and delivery of products, generally through distributors; or as an abbreviation of the \"means of production, distribution, and exchange\" which further includes the exchange of distributed products, generally to consumers.\nThe concept of \"Means of Production\" is used by researchers in various fields of study \u2014 including politics, economics, and sociology \u2014 to discuss, broadly, the relationship between anything that can have productive use, its ownership, and the constituent social parts needed to produce it.\nIndustrial production.\nFrom the perspective of a firm, a firm uses its capital goods, which are also known as tangible assets as they are physical in nature. Unfinished goods are transformed into products and services in the production process. Even if capital goods are not traded on the market as consumer goods, they can be valued as long as capital goods are produced commodities, which are required for production. The total values of capital goods constitute the capital value.\nThe social means of production are capital goods and assets that require organized collective labor effort, as opposed to individual effort, to operate on. The ownership and organization of the social means of production is a key factor in categorizing and defining different types of economic systems.\nThe means of production includes two broad categories of objects: instruments of labor (tools, factories, infrastructure, etc.) and subjects of labor (natural resources and raw materials). People operate on the subjects of labor using the instruments of labor to create a product; or stated another way, labor acting on the means of production creates a good. In an agrarian society the principal means of production is the soil and the shovel. In an industrial society the means of production become social means of production and include factories and mines.\nKnowledge production.\nIn a knowledge economy, learning, research, development, innovation, ideas and creativity are the means of [knowledge] production; communication such as books, articles, videos disseminated both physically and digitally over the Internet are a means of [knowledge] distribution. In a broad sense, the \"means of production\" also includes the \"means of distribution\" such as stores, the internet and railroads (Infrastructural capital).\nDepreciation.\nThe means of production of the firm may depreciate, which means there is a loss in the economic value of capital goods or tangible assets (e.g. machinery, factory equipment) due to wear and tear, and aging. This is known as the depreciation of capital goods.\nMarxism and Marxist theory of class.\nThe analysis of the technological sophistication of the means of production and how they are owned is a central component in the Marxist theoretical framework of historical materialism and in Marx's critique of political economy, and later in Marxian economics.\nIn Marx's work and subsequent developments in Marxist theory, the process of socioeconomic evolution is based on the premise of technological improvements in the means of production. As the level of technology improves with respect to productive capabilities, existing forms of social relations become superfluous and unnecessary as the advancement of technology integrated within the means of production contradicts the established organization of society and its economy.\nThe increasing efficiency of the means of production via the creation and adaptation of new technologies over time has a tendency to rearrange local and global market structures, leading to the disruption of existing profit pools, creating the possibility of massive economic impact. Disruptive technologies can lead to the devaluation of various forms of labor power, up to the point of making human labor power economically noncompetitive in certain applications, potentially widening income inequality.\nAccording to Marx, escalating tension between the upper and lower class is a major consequence of technology decreasing the value of labor force and the contradictory effect an evolving means of production has on established social and economic systems. Marx believed increasing inequality between the upper and lower classes acts as a major catalyst of class conflicts, which develop to a point where the existing mode of production inevitably becomes unsustainable, either collapsing or being overthrown in a social revolution, at which point the contradictory relationship between technological advancement and the value of labor force is resolved by the emergence of a new mode of production based on a different set of social relations including, most notably, different patterns of ownership for the means of production.\nOwnership of the means of production and control over the surplus product generated by their operation is the fundamental factor in delineating different modes of production. Capitalism is defined as private ownership and control over the means of production, where the surplus product becomes a source of unearned income for its owners. Under this system, profit-seeking individuals or organizations undertake a majority of economic activities. However, capitalism does not indicate all material means of production are privately owned as partial economies are publicly owned.\nDeterminant of class.\nMarx's theory of class defines classes in their relation to their ownership and control of the means of production. In a capitalist society, the bourgeoisie, or the capitalist class, is the class that owns the means of production and derives a passive income from their operation. Examples of the capitalist class include business owners, shareholders and the minority of people who own factories, machinery and lands. Countries considered as the capitalist countries include Australia, Canada, the U.S., and other nations which hold a free market economy. In modern society, small business owners, minority shareholders and other smaller capitalists are considered as \"Petite bourgeoisie\" according to Marx's theory, which is distinct from bourgeoisie and proletariat as they can buy the labour of others but also work along with employees.\nIn contrast, the proletariat, or working class, comprises the majority of the population that lacks access to the means of production and are therefore induced to sell their labour power for a wage or salary to gain access to necessities, goods and services.\nAccording to Marx, wages and salaries are considered as the price of labour power, related to working hours or outputs produced by the labour force. At the company level, an employee does not control and own the means of production in a capitalist mode of production. Instead, an employee is performing specific duties under a contract of employment, working for wages or salaries. As for firms and profit-seeking organizations, from a personnel economics perspective, to maximize efficiency and productivity there must be an equilibrium between labour markets and product markets. In human resource practices, compensation structure tends to shift towards pay-for-performance bonus or incentive pay rather than base salary to attract the right workers, even if conflicts of interest exist in an employer-worker relationship.\nTo the question of why classes exist in human societies in the first place, Karl Marx offered a historical and scientific explanation that it was the cultural practice of ownership of the means of production that gives rise to them. This explanation differs dramatically from other explanations based on \"differences in ability\" between individuals or on religious or political affiliations giving rise to castes. This explanation is consistent with the bulk of Marxist theory in which Politics and Religion are seen as mere outgrowths (superstructures) of the basic underlying economic reality of a people.\nRelated terms.\nFactors of production are defined by German philosopher Karl Marx in his book \"Das Kapital\" as labor, subjects of labor, and instruments of labor: the term is equivalent to means of production plus labor. The factors of production are often listed in economic writings derived from the classical school as \"land, labour and capital\". Marx sometimes used the term \"productive forces\" equivalently with \"factors of production\"; in \"Kapital\", he uses \"factors of production\", in his famous Preface to his \"Critique of Political Economy: A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy\", he uses \"productive forces\" (that may depend on the translation).\nProduction relations (German: \"Produktionsverh\u00e4ltnis\") are the relations humans enter into with each other in using the means of production to produce. Examples of such relations are employer/employee, buyer/seller, the technical division of labour in a factory, and property relations.\nMode of production (German: \"Produktionsweise\") means the dominant way in which production is organised in society. For instance, \"capitalism\" is the name for the capitalist \"mode of production\" in which the means of production are owned privately by a small class (the bourgeoisie) who profits off the labor of the working class (the proletariat). Communism is a mode of production in which the means of production are not owned by anyone, but shared in common, without class-based exploitation. Besides capitalism and communism, there is another mode of production which is called a Mixed Economic System. In a mixed economy, private ownership of capital goods are protected and a certain level of the market economy is allowed. However, the government has the right to intervene in the market and economic activities for social objectives. Different from the pure capitalism, the government regulation exists to control particular means of production over the private business sector. Different from communism, the majority of means of production are privately owned rather than shared in common.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNolan P.

He led the theatrical performances at the Viennese court and reformed the syllabi.\nCeltis is considered by many to be the greatest of German humanists and thus dubbed \"the Archhumanist\" (\"Erzhumanist\"). He is also praised as \"the greatest lyric genius and certainly the greatest organizer and popularizer of German Humanism\".\nLife.\nBorn at Wipfeld, near Schweinfurt (present-day Lower Franconia) under his original name Konrad Bickel or Pyckell (modern spelling Pickel), Celtes left home to avoid being set to his father's trade of vintner, and pursued his studies at the University of Cologne (1477\u20131479; B.A., 1479) and at the University of Heidelberg (M.A., 1485). While at Heidelberg, he received patronage and instruction from Dalberg and Agricola. As customary in those days for humanists, he Latinized his name, to Conradus Celtis. For some time he delivered humanist lectures during his travels to Erfurt, Rostock and Leipzig. His first work was titled \"Ars versificandi et carminum\" (The Art of Writing Verses and Poems, 1486). He further undertook lecture tours to Rome, Florence, Bologna and Venice.\nThe elector Frederick of Saxony approached the emperor Frederick III, who named Conrad Celtes \"Poet Laureate\" (Honored Poet) upon his return. At this great imperial ceremonial gathering in Nuremberg, Celtes was at the same time presented with a doctoral degree. Celtes again made a lecturing tour throughout the empire.\nIn 1489\u20131491, he stayed in Krak\u00f3w where he studied mathematics, astronomy and the natural sciences at the Jagiellonian University (at which he enrolled in 1489), and befriended many other humanists such as Lorenz Rabe and Bonacursius. He also founded a learned society, based on the Roman academies. The local branch of the society was called \"Sodalitas Litterarum Vistulana\" (the \"Literary Society on the Vistula River\").\nIn 1490 he once again went through Breslau (Wroc\u0142aw) to Prague, capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia. Hartmann Schedel used Celtis' descriptions of Breslau in the \"Schedelsche Weltchronik\" (Nuremberg Chronicle). In Hungary, Celtis formed the \"Sodalitas Litterarum Hungaria\" (\"Hungarian Literary Society\"), later as \"Sodalitas Litterarum Danubiana\" to be based in Vienna. He made stops at Regensburg, Passau and Nuremberg (and probably Mainz). At Heidelberg he founded the \"Sodalitas Litterarum Rhenana\" (\"Rhineland Literary Society\"). Later he went to L\u00fcbeck and Ingolstadt. At Ingolstadt, in 1492, he delivered his famous speech to the students there, in which he called on Germans to rival Italians in learning and letters. This would later become an extremely popular address in sixteenth-century German nationalistic sentiment.\nIn 1494, Celtes rediscovered Hrosvitha's works written in Latin in the monastery of St. Emmeram in Regensburg. His friend Willibald Pickheimer introduce him to Abbess Caritas Pickheimer. He wrote her in Latin and called her the \"new Hrotsvitha\".\nWhile the plague ravaged Ingolstadt, Celtes taught at Heidelberg. By now he was a professor. In 1497 Celtes was called to Vienna by the emperor Maximilian I, who honored him as \"teacher of the art of poetry and conversation\" with an imperial \"Privilegium\", the first of its kind. There he lectured on the works of classical writers and in 1502 founded the \"Collegium Poetarum\", a college for poets. His invitation to Vienna came about greatly at the influence of his friend and fellow scholar Johannes Cuspinian.\nCeltes died in Vienna a few years later of syphilis.\nAccording to Richard Unger, Celtes was a large scale book thief who walked around episcopal palaces and monastic libraries stealing books for his emperor and himself. He justified his behaviours on the basis of patriotic intentions, claiming that he only wanted to protect German patrimony from \"damaging weather, dust, mold... insects\", as well as Italians. Emily Abu writes that Celtis, Peutinger and their emperor took particular interest in cultural legacies that could provide connection between their German Roman Empire and the ancient Roman imperium. In the case of the Peutinger map (mentioned below), both Celtis and Peutinger made sure that any record of where Celtis found it as well as clues to the map's first three centuries were erased.\nWorks.\nConrad Celtes' teachings had lasting effects, particularly in the fields of classical languages and history. He brought systematic methods to the teaching of Latin and furthered the study of the classics. He was also the first to teach the history of the world as a whole. Celtes was the first early modern humanist who introduced the term \"topography\" as a critical appraisal of the Ptolemaic dichotomy between cosmography and chorography, which was becoming insufficient to reflect the rapidly changing contours of Europe.\nHe was the foremost cartographic writer in German lands. He worked on the large-scale cosmographic and cartographic project \"Germania Illustrata\", of which the core \u2014 among them the treatise \"Germania generalis\", four books of love elegies, and \"De origine, situ, moribus et institutis Norimbergae libellus\" (\"On the origins, site, habits and institutions of Nuremberg\") \u2014 was published under the title \"Quatuor libri amorum secundum quatuor latera germanie\" in Nuremberg (1502).\nIn 1493, he discovered the writings of Hroswitha of Gandersheim in the monastery of St. Emmaram. He then stole the manuscript and had it mass-printed across the Empire in 1501. Also in 1501, he received a privilege from the Imperial Aulic Council for the printing of his edition of her dramas. This was one of the earliest recorded privileges regarding copyrights granted by the Imperial government. Celtes also discovered a map showing roads of the Roman Empire, the \"Tabula Peutingeriana\", or Peutinger Table. Celtes collected numerous Greek and Latin manuscripts in his function as librarian of the imperial library that was founded by Maximilian, and he claimed to have discovered the missing books of Ovid's \"Fasti\" in a letter to the Venetian publisher Aldus Manutius in 1504. The purported new verses had actually been composed by an 11th-century monk and were known to the Empire of Nicaea according to William of Rubruck, but even so, many contemporary scholars believed Celtes and continued to write about the existence of the missing books until well into the 17th century. His epigrams, edited by Kark Hartfelder, were published in Berlin in 1881.\nConrad Celtes was more of a free-thinking humanist and placed a higher value on the ancient pagan, rather than the Christian ideal. His friend Willibald Pirckheimer had blunt discussions with him on that subject. As early as \"Ode ad Apollinem\" (1486), he began to style himself as an Apollo-Priest. The most important earthly Phoebus to him was Maximilian, whose symbiotic relationship with the scholar (and thus their double glory) was often reflected in Celtis's literary works.\nThe Celtis-Gymnasium in Schweinfurt was named after Conrad Celtis.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although the purpose of punitive damages is not to compensate the plaintiff, the plaintiff will receive all or some of the punitive damages in award.\nPunitive damages are often awarded if compensatory damages are deemed to be an inadequate remedy by themselves. The court may impose them to prevent undercompensation of plaintiffs and to allow redress for undetectable torts and taking some strain away from the criminal justice system. Punitive damages are most important for violations of the law that are hard to detect.\nHowever, punitive damages awarded under court systems that recognize them may be difficult to enforce in jurisdictions that do not recognize them. For example, punitive damages awarded to one party in a US case would be difficult to get recognition for in a European court in which punitive damages are most likely to be considered to violate ordre public.\nBecause they are usually paid in excess of the plaintiff's provable injuries, punitive damages are awarded only in special cases, usually under tort law, if the defendant's conduct was egregiously insidious. Punitive damages cannot generally be awarded in contract disputes. The main exception is in insurance bad faith cases in the US if the insurer's breach of contract is alleged to be so egregious as to amount to a breach of the \"implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing\", and is therefore considered to be a \"tort\" cause of action eligible for punitive damages (in excess of the value of the insurance policy).\nAccording to deterrence theory the optimal ratio between punitive and compensatory damages is the multiplicative inverse to the clearance rate and conviction rate. This multiple avoids recidivism, overdeterrence and escaping legal liability due to the dark figure of crime.\nNational applications.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, punitive damages are not available for breach of contract, but are possible for tort cases to the extent that such claims are not prohibited or restricted by statue (e.g. personal injury claims arising from negligence).\nThe law is less settled regarding equitable wrongs. In \"Harris v Digital Pulse Pty Ltd\", the defendant employees knowingly breached contractual and fiduciary duties to their employer by diverting business to themselves and misusing its confidential information. The New South Wales Court of Appeal held that punitive damages are not available both for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. Heydon JA (as he then was) said there is no power to give punitive damages in respect of a claim in equity, although he was content to decide the case on the narrower ground that there is no power to award punitive damages for the specific equitable wrong in issue. Spigelman CJ concurred, although he emphasized that the contractual character of the fiduciary relationship in question, and refrained from deciding on whether punitive damages would be available in respect of equitable wrongs more analogous to torts. Mason P dissented and opined that there was no principled reason to award punitive damages in respect of common law torts but not analogous equitable wrongs.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, punitive damages may be awarded in exceptional cases for \"malicious, oppressive and high-handed\" misconduct. The Supreme Court of Canada set out 11 principles to guide judges and juries for awarding punitive damages in the leading case \"Whiten v Pilot Insurance Co\" 2002 SCC 18. The principles are not intended to form a checklist or be mandatory, but instead is to be considered based on the facts of each case.\nEngland and Wales.\nIn England and Wales, exemplary damages in tort cases are limited to cases in which at least one of the circumstances set out by Lord Devlin in the leading case of \"Rookes v Barnard\" has been met:\n\"Rookes v Barnard\" has been much criticised and has not been followed in Canada, Australia or New Zealand, despite English cases often being influential in other Commonwealth countries and with the Privy Council. It was strongly criticised by the Court of Appeal in \"Broome v Cassell\", but on appeal the House of Lords upheld \"Rookes v Barnard\".\nThe second \"Rookes\" category\u2014where punitive damages are allowed to remedy conduct by a defendant calculated to make a profit\u2014was applied in a defamation context in \"Broome v Cassell\", and is frequently used in tort actions by tenants against landlords, as well as in cases of insurance fraud.\nExamples of statutory authorisation of punitive damages (the third \"Rookes\" category) include section 34 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013, which allows claimants to seek, and courts to grant, exemplary damages against news media publishers when they show \"a deliberate or reckless disregard of an outrageous nature for the claimant's rights\". Some judicial dispute exists as to whether statutory provisions Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (and predecessors thereof) amount to a statutory authorisation.\nExemplary damages go beyond the philosophical aims of a contractual remedy and are not available as damages for breach of contract. Lord Atkinson said, in \"Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u201cIn many other cases of breach of contract there may be circumstances of malice, fraud, defamation, or violence, which would sustain an action of tort as an alternative remedy to an action for breach of contract. If one should select the former mode of redress, he may, no doubt, recover exemplary damages, or what is sometimes styled vindictive damages; but if he should choose to seek redress in the form of an action for breach of contract, he lets in all the consequences of that form of action: \"Thorpe v Thorpe\" (1832) 3B.&amp;Ad. 580. One of these consequences is, I think, this: that he is to be paid adequate compensation in money for the loss of that which he would have received had his contract been kept, and no more.\u201d\nIn 1997 the Law Commission recommended that punitive damages should never be available for breach of contract.\nGermany.\nGerman courts do not award punitive damages and consider foreign punitive damages unenforceable to the extent that the payment would exceed the damages plus an allowance for reasonable defense costs big enough so that the plaintiff would get a full reimbursement of its loss but not more.\nJapan.\nJapanese courts do not award punitive damages as a matter of public policy, and Japanese law prohibits the enforcement of punitive damage awards obtained overseas.\nIn Japan, medical negligence and other species of negligence are governed by the criminal code, which may impose much harsher penalties than civil law. For instance, many causes of action which would subject a defendant to a potential punitive damage award in the U.S. would subject the same individual to prison time in Japan.\nNew Zealand.\nIn New Zealand it was held in \"Donselaar v. Donselaar\" and confirmed in \"Auckland City Council v. Blundell\" that the existence of the Accident Compensation Corporation did not bar the availability of exemplary damages. In \"Paper Reclaim Ltd v Aotearoa International Ltd\" it was held that exemplary damages are not to be awarded in actions for breach of contract but the court left open the possibility that exemplary damages might be available where the breach of contract is a tort.\nIn 2010, in \"Couch v Attorney-General\" the New Zealand Supreme Court barred exemplary damages for cases of negligence unless the defendant acts intentionally or with subjective recklessness.\nPunitive damages can also be awarded for equitable wrongs. In \"Acquaculture Corporation v New Zealand Green Mussel Co Ltd\", the majority of the New Zealand Court of Appeal held that in addition to compensation, punitive damages could be awarded for breach of confidence, albeit that, on the facts, they were not merited. Similarly, in \"Cook v Evatt (No.2)\", Fisher J in the New Zealand High Court added exemplary damages of NZ$5,000 to an account of profits of over NZ$20,000 for breach of fiduciary duty.\nPeople's Republic of China.\nIn very few industries, punitive damages could be awarded in either contractual or tort case, except a tort relevant to product defraud or defect. Article 49 of the PRC Law on Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests enacted on October 31, 1993, provides the rule that any consumer is entitled to a recovery of double the purchase price of products or service from the seller or service provider against their defraud. Successful cases have been widely reported in this regard.\nArticle 96 of the PRC Law on Food Safety adopted on February 28, 2009, raises the punitive damages to ten times the purchase price added to the compensatory damages that the victim has already claimed from the producer or seller for food with poor quality not compliant to food safety standards. Such a substantial statutory amount considered by the legislative organ is based on several extremely serious food quality incidents in the past two years, such as the notorious Sanlu tainted milk powder case.\nApplication of the punitive damage rule is further expanded with the enactment of the PRC Law on Tort Liability effective as of July 1, 2010. This new law sets forth that a victim is entitled to claim punitive damages from any manufacturer or seller expressly aware of the defects in products but still produces or sells them if it results in death or heavy injuries. Since this is a somewhat new law so far, no further explanatory regulation regarding a detailed amount and applicable scope is promulgated guiding the application of this rule, so a court judge may have discretional power to decide punitive damages case by case under this new law.\nUnited States.\nPunitive damages are a settled principle of common law in the United States. They are generally a matter of state law (although they can also be awarded under federal maritime law), and thus differ in application from state to state. In many states, including California and Texas, punitive damages are determined based on statute; elsewhere, they may be determined solely based on case law. Many state statutes are the result of insurance industry lobbying to impose \"caps\" on punitive damages; however, several state courts have struck down these statutory caps as unconstitutional. They are rare, occurring in only 6% of civil cases that result in a monetary award. Punitive damages are entirely unavailable under any circumstances in a few jurisdictions, including Nebraska, Puerto Rico, and Washington.\nThe general rule is that punitive damages cannot be awarded for breach of contract, but if an independent tort is committed in a contractual setting, punitive damages can be awarded for the tort. Although state laws vary, punitive damages are usually allowed only when the defendant has displayed actual \"intent\" to cause harm (such as purposefully rear-ending someone else's car), rather than in cases of mere negligence, or causes an injury through action taken in reckless disregard for the lives and safety of others.\nPunitive damages are a focal point of the tort reform debate in the United States, where numerous highly publicized multimillion-dollar verdicts have led to a fairly common perception that punitive damage awards tend to be excessive. However, statistical studies by law professors and the Department of Justice have found that punitive damages are only awarded in two percent of civil cases which go to trial, and that the median punitive damage award is between $38,000 and $50,000.\nThere is no maximum dollar amount of punitive damages that a defendant can be ordered to pay. In response to judges and juries which award high punitive damages verdicts, the Supreme Court of the United States has made several decisions which limit awards of punitive damages through the due process of law clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. In a number of cases, the Court has indicated that a 4:1 ratio between punitive and compensatory damages is high enough to lead to a finding of constitutional impropriety and that any ratio of 10:1 or higher is almost certainly unconstitutional. However, the Supreme Court carved out a notable exception to this rule of proportionality in the case of \"TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp.\", where it affirmed an award of $10 million in punitive damages, despite the compensatory damages being only $19,000, a punitive-to-compensatory ratio of more than 526-to-1. In this case, the Supreme Court affirmed that disproportionate punitive damages were allowed for especially egregious conduct.\nIn the case of \"Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants\" (1994), 79-year-old Stella Liebeck spilled McDonald's coffee in her lap which resulted in second and third-degree burns on her thighs, buttocks, groin and genitals. The burns were severe enough to require skin grafts. Liebeck attempted to have McDonald's pay her $20,000 medical bills as indemnity for the incident. McDonald's refused, and Liebeck sued. During the case's discovery process, internal documents from McDonald's revealed the company had received hundreds of similar complaints from customers claiming McDonald's coffee caused severe burns. At trial, this led the jury to find McDonald's knew their product was dangerous and injuring their customers, and that the company had done nothing to correct the problem. The jury decided on $200,000 in compensatory damages, but attributed 20 percent of the fault to Liebeck, reducing her compensation to $160,000. The jury also awarded Liebeck $2.7 million in punitive damages, which was at the time two days of McDonald's coffee sales revenue. The judge later reduced the punitive damages to $480,000. The case is often criticized for the very high amount of damages the jury awarded. Nevertheless, many legal scholars and documentary film makers like \"Hot Coffee\" argued that corporate lobbyists seized the opportunity to create public misinformation and distrust of the legal system by leaving out important facts in their television advertisements, such as, that the verdict was roughly equivalent to two days of coffee sales for McDonald's, that Liebeck received permanent injury to her genitals and groin requiring surgery, and that McDonald's had already received numerous complaints about the temperature of the coffee.\nIn \"BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore\" (1996), the Supreme Court ruled that an excessive punitive award can amount to an arbitrary deprivation of property in violation of due process. The court held that punitive damages must be reasonable, as determined by the degree of reprehensibility of the conduct that caused the plaintiff's injury, the ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages, and any comparable criminal or civil penalties applicable to the conduct. In \"State Farm Auto. Ins. v. Campbell\" (2003), the Supreme Court held that punitive damages might only be based on the acts of the defendants which harmed the plaintiffs. The court also elaborated on the factors courts must apply when reviewing a punitive award under due process principles.\nMost recently, in \"Philip Morris USA v. Williams\" (2007), the Supreme Court ruled that punitive damage awards cannot be imposed for the direct harm that the misconduct caused others, but may consider harm to others as a function of determining how reprehensible it was. More reprehensible misconduct justifies a larger punitive damage award, just as a repeat offender in criminal law may be punished with a tougher sentence. Dissenting in the \"Williams\" case, Justice John Paul Stevens found that the \"nuance eludes me\", suggesting that the majority had resolved the case on a distinction that makes no difference.\nPunitive damages are subjective by their very nature. Since their purpose is to punish\u2014as opposed to compensate\u2014opinions on how to accomplish this will vary widely among jurors. Regardless, research into punitive damages has revealed some common principles. Wealth of the defendant is positively correlated with large punitive damage awards, jurors either downplay or ignore jury instructions regarding punitive damages determinations, and jurors tend to punish defendants who have conducted a cost-benefit analysis.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A misanthrope or misanthropist is someone who holds such views or feelings. Misanthropy involves a negative evaluative attitude toward humanity that is based on humankind's flaws. Misanthropes hold that these flaws characterize all or at least the greater majority of human beings. They claim that there is no easy way to rectify them short of a complete transformation of the dominant way of life. Various types of misanthropy are distinguished in the academic literature based on what attitude is involved, at whom it is directed, and how it is expressed. Either emotions or theoretical judgments can serve as the foundation of the attitude. It can be directed toward all humans without exception or exclude a few idealized people. In this regard, some misanthropes condemn themselves while others consider themselves superior to everyone else. Misanthropy is sometimes associated with a destructive outlook aiming to hurt other people or an attempt to flee society. Other types of misanthropic stances include activism by trying to improve humanity, quietism in the form of resignation, and humor mocking the absurdity of the human condition.\nThe negative misanthropic outlook is based on different types of human flaws. Moral flaws and unethical decisions are often seen as the foundational factor. They include cruelty, selfishness, injustice, greed, and indifference to the suffering of others. They may result in harm to humans and animals, such as genocides and factory farming of livestock. Other flaws include intellectual flaws, like dogmatism and cognitive biases, as well as aesthetic flaws concerning ugliness and lack of sensitivity to beauty. Many debates in the academic literature discuss whether misanthropy is a valid viewpoint and what its implications are. Proponents of misanthropy usually point to human flaws and the harm they have caused as a sufficient reason for condemning humanity. Critics have responded to this line of thought by claiming that severe flaws concern only a few extreme cases, like mentally ill perpetrators, but not humanity at large. Another objection is based on the claim that humans also have virtues besides their flaws and that a balanced evaluation might be overall positive. A further criticism rejects misanthropy because of its association with hatred, which may lead to violence, and because it may make people friendless and unhappy. Defenders of misanthropy have responded by claiming that this applies only to some forms of misanthropy but not to misanthropy in general.\nA related issue concerns the question of the psychological and social factors that cause people to become misanthropes. They include socio-economic inequality, living under an authoritarian regime, and undergoing personal disappointments in life. Misanthropy is relevant in various disciplines. It has been discussed and exemplified by philosophers throughout history, like Heraclitus, Diogenes, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Friedrich Nietzsche. Misanthropic outlooks form part of some religious teachings discussing the deep flaws of human beings, like the Christian doctrine of original sin. Misanthropic perspectives and characters are also found in literature and popular culture. They include William Shakespeare's portrayal of Timon of Athens, Moli\u00e8re's play \"The Misanthrope\", and \"Gulliver's Travels\" by Jonathan Swift. Misanthropy is closely related to but not identical to philosophical pessimism. Some misanthropes promote antinatalism, the view that humans should abstain from procreation.\nDefinition.\nMisanthropy is traditionally defined as hatred or dislike of humankind. The word originated in the 17th century and has its roots in the Greek words \u03bc\u1fd6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \"m\u012bsos\" 'hatred' and \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \"\u0101nthropos\" 'man, human'. In contemporary philosophy, the term is usually understood in a wider sense as a negative evaluation of humanity as a whole based on humanity's vices and flaws. This negative evaluation can express itself in various forms, hatred being only one of them. In this sense, misanthropy has a cognitive component based on a negative assessment of humanity and is not just a blind rejection. Misanthropy is usually contrasted with philanthropy, which refers to the love of humankind and is linked to efforts to increase human well-being, for example, through good will, charitable aid, and donations. Both terms have a range of meanings and do not necessarily contradict each other. In this regard, the same person may be a misanthrope in one sense and a philanthrope in another sense.\nOne central aspect of all forms of misanthropy is that their target is not local but ubiquitous. This means that the negative attitude is not just directed at some individual persons or groups but at humanity as a whole. In this regard, misanthropy is different from other forms of negative discriminatory attitudes directed at a particular group of people. This distinguishes it from the intolerance exemplified by misogynists, misandrists, and racists, which hold a negative attitude toward women, men, or certain races. According to literature theorist Andrew Gibson, misanthropy does not need to be universal in the sense that a person literally dislikes every human being. Instead, it depends on the person's horizon. For instance, a villager who loathes every other villager without exception is a misanthrope if their horizon is limited to only this village.\nBoth misanthropes and their critics agree that negative features and failings are not equally distributed, i.e. that the vices and bad traits are exemplified much more strongly in some than in others. But for misanthropy, the negative assessment of humanity is not based on a few extreme and outstanding cases: it is a condemnation of humanity as a whole that is not just directed at exceptionally bad individuals but includes regular people as well. Because of this focus on the ordinary, it is sometimes held that these flaws are obvious and trivial but people may ignore them due to intellectual flaws. Some see the flaws as part of human nature as such. Others also base their view on non-essential flaws, i.e. what humanity has come to be. This includes flaws seen as symptoms of modern civilization in general. Nevertheless, both groups agree that the relevant flaws are \"entrenched\". This means that there is either no or no easy way to rectify them and nothing short of a complete transformation of the dominant way of life would be required if that is possible at all.\nTypes.\nVarious types of misanthropy are distinguished in the academic literature. They are based on what attitude is involved, how it is expressed, and whether the misanthropes include themselves in their negative assessment. The differences between them often matter for assessing the arguments for and against misanthropy. An early categorization suggested by Immanuel Kant distinguishes between \"positive\" and \"negative\" misanthropes. Positive misanthropes are active enemies of humanity. They wish harm to other people and undertake attempts to hurt them in one form or another. Negative misanthropy, by contrast, is a form of peaceful anthropophobia that leads people to isolate themselves. They may wish others well despite seeing serious flaws in them and prefer to not involve themselves in the social context of humanity. Kant associates negative misanthropy with moral disappointment due to previous negative experiences with others.\nAnother distinction focuses on whether the misanthropic condemnation of humanity is only directed at other people or at everyone including oneself. In this regard, \"self-inclusive\" misanthropes are consistent in their attitude by including themselves in their negative assessment. This type is contrasted with \"self-aggrandizing\" misanthropes, who either implicitly or explicitly exclude themselves from the general condemnation and see themselves instead as superior to everyone else. In this regard, it may be accompanied by an exaggerated sense of self-worth and self-importance. According to literature theorist Joseph Harris, the self-aggrandizing type is more common. He states that this outlook seems to undermine its own position by constituting a form of hypocrisy. A closely related categorization developed by Irving Babbitt distinguishes misanthropes based on whether they allow exceptions in their negative assessment. In this regard, \"misanthropes of the naked intellect\" regard humanity as a whole as hopeless. \"Tender misanthropes\" exclude a few idealized people from their negative evaluation. Babbitt cites Rousseau and his fondness for natural uncivilized man as an example of tender misanthropy and contrasts it with Jonathan Swift's thorough dismissal of all of humanity.\nA further way to categorize forms of misanthropy is in relation to the type of attitude involved toward humanity. In this regard, philosopher Toby Svoboda distinguishes the attitudes of dislike, hate, contempt, and judgment. A misanthrope based on dislike harbors a distaste in the form of negative feelings toward other people. Misanthropy focusing on hatred involves an intense form of dislike. It includes the additional component of wishing ill upon others and at times trying to realize this wish. In the case of contempt, the attitude is not based on feelings and emotions but on a more theoretical outlook. It leads misanthropes to see other people as worthless and look down on them while excluding themselves from this assessment. If the misanthropic attitude has its foundation in judgment, it is also theoretical but does not distinguish between self and others. It is the view that humanity is in general bad without implying that the misanthrope is in any way better than the rest. According to Svoboda, only misanthropy based on judgment constitutes a serious philosophical position. He holds that misanthropy focusing on contempt is biased against other people while misanthropy in the form of dislike and hate is difficult to assess since these emotional attitudes often do not respond to objective evidence.\nMisanthropic forms of life.\nMisanthropy is usually not restricted to a theoretical opinion but involves an evaluative attitude that calls for a practical response. It can express itself in different forms of life. They come with different dominant emotions and practical consequences for how to lead one's life. These responses to misanthropy are sometimes presented through simplified archetypes that may be too crude to accurately capture the mental life of any single person. Instead, they aim to portray common attitudes among groups of misanthropes. The two responses most commonly linked to misanthropy involve either destruction or fleeing from society. The destructive misanthrope is said to be driven by a hatred of humankind and aims at tearing it down, with violence if necessary. For the fugitive misanthrope, fear is the dominant emotion and leads the misanthrope to seek a secluded place in order to avoid the corrupting contact with civilization and humanity as much as possible.\nThe contemporary misanthropic literature has also identified further less-known types of misanthropic lifestyles. The activist misanthrope is driven by hope despite their negative appraisal of humanity. This hope is a form of meliorism based on the idea that it is possible and feasible for humanity to transform itself and the activist tries to realize this ideal. A weaker version of this approach is to try to improve the world incrementally to avoid some of the worst outcomes without the hope of fully solving the basic problem. Activist misanthropes differ from quietist misanthropes, who take a pessimistic approach toward what the person can do for bringing about a transformation or significant improvements. In contrast to the more drastic reactions of the other responses mentioned, they resign themselves to quiet acceptance and small-scale avoidance. A further approach is focused on humor based on mockery and ridicule at the absurdity of the human condition. An example is that humans hurt each other and risk future self-destruction for trivial concerns like a marginal increase in profit. This way, humor can act both as a mirror to portray the terrible truth of the situation and as its palliative at the same time.\nForms of human flaws.\nA core aspect of misanthropy is that its negative attitude toward humanity is based on human flaws. Various misanthropes have provided extensive lists of flaws, including cruelty, greed, selfishness, wastefulness, dogmatism, self-deception, and insensitivity to beauty. These flaws can be categorized in many ways. It is often held that moral flaws constitute the most serious case. Other flaws discussed in the contemporary literature include intellectual flaws, aesthetic flaws, and spiritual flaws.\nMoral flaws are usually understood as tendencies to violate moral norms or as mistaken attitudes toward what is the good. They include cruelty, indifference to the suffering of others, selfishness, moral laziness, cowardice, injustice, greed, and ingratitude. The harm done because of these flaws can be divided into three categories: harm done directly to humans, harm done directly to other animals, and harm done indirectly to both humans and other animals by harming the environment. Examples of these categories include the Holocaust, factory farming of livestock, and pollution causing climate change. In this regard, it is not just relevant that human beings cause these forms of harm but also that they are morally responsible for them. This is based on the idea that they can understand the consequences of their actions and could act differently. However, they decide not to, for example, because they ignore the long-term well-being of others in order to get short-term personal benefits.\nIntellectual flaws concern cognitive capacities. They can be defined as what leads to false beliefs, what obstructs knowledge, or what violates the demands of rationality. They include intellectual vices, like arrogance, wishful thinking, and dogmatism. Further examples are stupidity, gullibility, and cognitive biases, like the confirmation bias, the self-serving bias, the hindsight bias, and the anchoring bias. Intellectual flaws can work in tandem with all kinds of vices: they may deceive someone about having a vice. This prevents the affected person from addressing it and improving themselves, for instance, by being mindless and failing to recognize it. They also include forms of self-deceit, wilful ignorance, and being in denial about something. Similar considerations have prompted some traditions to see intellectual failings, like ignorance, as the root of all evil.\n\"Aesthetic flaws\" are usually not given the same importance as moral and intellectual flaws, but they also carry some weight for misanthropic considerations. These flaws relate to beauty and ugliness. They concern ugly aspects of human life itself, like defecation and aging. Other examples are ugliness caused by human activities, like pollution and litter, and inappropriate attitudes toward aesthetic aspects, like being insensitive to beauty.\nCauses.\nVarious psychological and social factors have been identified in the academic literature as possible causes of misanthropic sentiments. The individual factors by themselves may not be able to fully explain misanthropy but can show instead how it becomes more likely. For example, disappointments and disillusionments in life can cause a person to adopt a misanthropic outlook. In this regard, the more idealistic and optimistic the person initially was, the stronger this reversal and the following negative outlook tend to be. This type of psychological explanation is found as early as Plato's Phaedo. In it, Socrates considers a person who trusts and admires someone without knowing them sufficiently well. He argues that misanthropy may arise if it is discovered later that the admired person has serious flaws. In this case, the initial attitude is reversed and universalized to apply to all others, leading to general distrust and contempt toward other humans. Socrates argues that this becomes more likely if the admired person is a close friend and if it happens more than once. This form of misanthropy may be accompanied by a feeling of moral superiority in which the misanthrope considers themselves to be better than everyone else.\nOther types of negative personal experiences in life may have a similar effect. Andrew Gibson uses this line of thought to explain why some philosophers became misanthropes. He uses the example of Thomas Hobbes to explain how a politically unstable environment and the frequent wars can foster a misanthropic attitude. Regarding Arthur Schopenhauer, he states that being forced to flee one's home at an early age and never finding a place to call home afterward can have a similar effect. Another psychological factor concerns negative attitudes toward the human body, especially in the form of general revulsion from sexuality.\nBesides the psychological causes, some wider social circumstances may also play a role. Generally speaking, the more negative the circumstances are, the more likely misanthropy becomes. For instance, according to political scientist Eric M. Uslaner, socio-economic inequality in the form of unfair distribution of wealth increases the tendency to adopt a misanthropic perspective. This has to do with the fact that inequality tends to undermine trust in the government and others. Uslaner suggests that it may be possible to overcome or reduce this source of misanthropy by implementing policies that build trust and promote a more equal distribution of wealth. The political regime is another relevant factor. This specifically concerns authoritarian regimes using all means available to repress their population and stay in power. For example, it has been argued that the severe forms of repression of the Ancien R\u00e9gime in the late 17th century made it more likely for people to adopt a misanthropic outlook because their freedom was denied. Democracy may have the opposite effect since it allows more personal freedom due to its more optimistic outlook on human nature.\nEmpirical studies often use questions related to trust in other people to measure misanthropy. This concerns specifically whether the person believes that others would be fair and helpful. In an empirical study on misanthropy in American society, Tom W. Smith concludes that factors responsible for an increased misanthropic outlook are low socioeconomic status, being from racial and ethnic minorities, and having experienced recent negative events in one's life. In regard to religion, misanthropy is higher for people who do not attend church and for fundamentalists. Some factors seem to play no significant role, like gender, having undergone a divorce, and never having been married. Another study by Morris Rosenberg finds that misanthropy is linked to certain political outlooks. They include being skeptical about free speech and a tendency to support authoritarian policies. This concerns, for example, tendencies to suppress political and religious liberties.\nArguments.\nVarious discussions in the academic literature concern the question of whether misanthropy is an accurate assessment of humanity and what the consequences of adopting it are. Many proponents of misanthropy focus on human flaws together with examples of when they exercise their negative influences. They argue that these flaws are so severe that misanthropy is an appropriate response.\nSpecial importance in this regard is usually given to moral faults. This is based on the idea that humans do not merely cause a great deal of suffering and destruction but are also morally responsible for them. The reason is that they are intelligent enough to understand the consequences of their actions and could potentially make balanced long-term decisions instead of focusing on personal short-term gains.\nProponents of misanthropy sometimes focus on extreme individual manifestations of human flaws, like mass killings ordered by dictators. Others emphasize that the problem is not limited to a few cases, for example, that many ordinary people are complicit in their manifestation by supporting the political leaders committing them. A closely related argument is to claim that the underlying flaws are there in everyone, even if they reach their most extreme manifestation only in a few. Another approach is to focus not on the grand extreme cases but on the ordinary small-scale manifestations of human flaws in everyday life, such as lying, cheating, breaking promises, and being ungrateful.\nSome arguments for misanthropy focus not only on general tendencies but on actual damage caused by humans in the past. This concerns, for instance, damages done to the ecosystem, like ecological catastrophes resulting in mass extinctions.\nCriticism.\nVarious theorists have criticized misanthropy. Some opponents acknowledge that there are extreme individual manifestations of human flaws, like mentally ill perpetrators, but claim that these cases do not reflect humanity at large and cannot justify the misanthropic attitude. For instance, while there are cases of extreme human brutality, like the mass killings committed by dictators and their forces, listing such cases is not sufficient for condemning humanity at large.\nSome critics of misanthropy acknowledge that humans have various flaws but state that they present just one side of humanity while evaluative attitudes should take all sides into account. This line of thought is based on the idea that humans possess equally important virtues that make up for their shortcomings. For example, accounts that focus only on the great wars, cruelties, and tragedies in human history ignore its positive achievements in the sciences, arts, and humanities.\nAnother explanation given by critics is that the negative assessment should not be directed at humanity but at some social forces. These forces can include capitalism, communism, patriarchy, racism, religious fundamentalism, or imperialism. Supporters of this argument would adopt an opposition to one of these social forces rather than a misanthropic opposition to humanity.\nSome objections to misanthropy are based not on whether this attitude appropriately reflects the negative value of humanity but on the costs of accepting such a position. The costs can affect both the individual misanthrope and the society at large. This is especially relevant if misanthropy is linked to hatred, which may turn easily into violence against social institutions and other humans and may result in harm. Misanthropy may also deprive the person of most pleasures by making them miserable and friendless.\nAnother form of criticism focuses more on the theoretical level and claims that misanthropy is an inconsistent and self-contradictory position. An example of this inconsistency is the misanthrope's tendency to denounce the social world while still being engaged in it and being unable to fully leave it behind. This criticism applies specifically to misanthropes who exclude themselves from the negative evaluation and look down on others with contempt from an arrogant position of inflated ego but it may not apply to all types of misanthropy. A closely related objection is based on the claim that misanthropy is an unnatural attitude and should therefore be seen as an aberration or a pathological case.\nIn various disciplines.\nHistory of philosophy.\nMisanthropy has been discussed and exemplified by philosophers throughout history. One of the earliest cases was the pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus. He is often characterized as a solitary person who is not fond of social interactions with others. A central factor to his negative outlook on human beings was their lack of comprehension of the true nature of reality. This concerns especially cases in which they remain in a state of ignorance despite having received a thorough explanation of the issue in question. Another early discussion is found in Plato's Phaedo, where misanthropy is characterized as the result of frustrated expectations and excessively na\u00efve optimism.\nVarious reflections on misanthropy are also found in the cynic school of philosophy. There it is argued, for instance, that humans keep on reproducing and multiplying the evils they are attempting to flee. An example given by the first-century philosopher Dio Chrysostom is that humans move to cities to defend themselves against outsiders but this process thwarts their initial goal by leading to even more violence due to high crime rates within the city. Diogenes is a well-known cynic misanthrope. He saw other people as hypocritical and superficial. He openly rejected all kinds of societal norms and values, often provoking others by consciously breaking conventions and behaving rudely.\nThomas Hobbes is an example of misanthropy in early modern philosophy. His negative outlook on humanity is reflected in many of his works. For him, humans are egoistic and violent: they act according to their self-interest and are willing to pursue their goals at the expense of others. In their natural state, this leads to a never-ending war in which \"every man to every man ... is an enemy\". He saw the establishment of an authoritative state characterized by the strict enforcement of laws to maintain order as the only way to tame the violent human nature and avoid perpetual war.\nA further type of misanthropy is found in Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He idealizes the harmony and simplicity found in nature and contrasts them with the confusion and disorder found in humanity, especially in the form of society and institutions. For instance, he claims that \"Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains\". This negative outlook was also reflected in his lifestyle: he lived solitary and preferred to be with plants rather than humans.\nArthur Schopenhauer is often mentioned as a prime example of misanthropy. According to him, everything in the world, including humans and their activities, is an expression of one underlying will. This will is blind, which causes it to continuously engage in futile struggles. On the level of human life, this \"presents itself as a continual deception\" since it is driven by pointless desires. They are mostly egoistic and often result in injustice and suffering to others. Once they are satisfied, they only give rise to new pointless desires and more suffering. In this regard, Schopenhauer dismisses most things that are typically considered precious or meaningful in human life, like romantic love, individuality, and liberty. He holds that the best response to the human condition is a form of asceticism by denying the expression of the will. This is only found in rare humans and \"the dull majority of men\" does not live up to this ideal.\nFriedrich Nietzsche, who was strongly influenced by Schopenhauer, is also often cited as an example of misanthropy. He saw man as a decadent and \"sick animal\" that shows no progress over other animals. He even expressed a negative attitude toward apes since they are more similar to human beings than other animals, for example, with regard to cruelty. For Nietzsche, a noteworthy flaw of human beings is their tendency to create and enforce systems of moral rules that favor weak people and suppress true greatness. He held that the human being is something to be overcome and used the term \u00dcbermensch to describe an ideal individual who has transcended traditional moral and societal norms.\nReligion.\nSome misanthropic views are also found in religious teachings. In Christianity, for instance, this is linked to the sinful nature of humans and the widespread manifestation of sin in everyday life. Common forms of sin are discussed in terms of the seven deadly sins. Examples are an excessive sense of self-importance in the form of pride and strong sexual cravings constituting lust. They also include the tendency to follow greed for material possessions as well as being envious of the possessions of others. According to the doctrine of original sin, this flaw is found in every human being since the doctrine states that human nature is already tainted by sin from birth by inheriting it from Adam and Eve's rebellion against God's authority. John Calvin's theology of total depravity has been described by some theologians as misanthropic.\nMisanthropic perspectives can also be discerned in various Buddhist teachings. For example, Buddha had a negative outlook on the widespread flaws of human beings, including lust, hatred, delusion, sorrow, and despair. These flaws are identified with some form of craving or attachment (ta\u1e47h\u0101) and cause suffering (dukkha). Buddhists hold that it is possible to overcome these failings in the process of achieving Buddhahood or enlightenment. However, this is seen as a difficult achievement, meaning that these failings apply to most human beings.\nHowever, there are also many religious teachings opposed to misanthropy, such as the emphasis on kindness and helping others. In Christianity, this is found in the concept of agape, which involves selfless and unconditional love in the form of compassion and a willingness to help others. Buddhists see the practice of loving kindness (metta) as a central aspect that implies a positive intention of compassion and the expression of kindness toward all sentient beings.\nLiterature and popular culture.\nMany examples of misanthropy are also found in literature and popular culture. Timon of Athens by William Shakespeare is a famous portrayal of the life of the Ancient Greek Timon, who is widely known for his extreme misanthropic attitude. Shakespeare depicts him as a wealthy and generous gentleman. However, he becomes disillusioned with his ungrateful friends and humanity at large. This way, his initial philanthropy turns into an unrestrained hatred of humanity, which prompts him to leave society in order to live in a forest. Moli\u00e8re's play \"The Misanthrope\" is another famous example. Its protagonist, Alceste, has a low opinion of the people around him. He tends to focus on their flaws and openly criticizes them for their superficiality, insincerity, and hypocrisy. He rejects most social conventions and thereby often offends others, for example, by refusing to engage in social niceties like polite small talk.\nThe author Jonathan Swift had a reputation for being misanthropic. In some statements, he openly declares that he hates and detests \"that animal called man\". Misanthropy is also found in many of his works. An example is \"Gulliver's Travels\", which tells the adventures of the protagonist Gulliver, who journeys to various places, like an island inhabited by tiny people and a land ruled by intelligent horses. Through these experiences of the contrast between humans and other species, he comes to see more and more the deep flaws of humanity, leading him to develop a revulsion toward other human beings. Ebenezer Scrooge from Charles Dickens's \"A Christmas Carol\" is an often-cited example of misanthropy. He is described as a cold-hearted, solitary miser who detests Christmas. He is greedy, selfish, and has no regard for the well-being of others. Other writers associated with misanthropy include Gustave Flaubert and Philip Larkin.\nThe Joker from the DC Universe is an example of misanthropy in popular culture. He is one of the main antagonists of Batman and acts as an agent of chaos. He believes that people are selfish, cruel, irrational, and hypocritical. He is usually portrayed as a sociopath with a twisted sense of humor who uses violent means to expose and bring down organized society.\nRelated concepts.\nPhilosophical pessimism.\nMisanthropy is closely related but not identical to philosophical pessimism. Philosophical pessimism is the view that life is not worth living or that the world is a bad place, for example, because it is meaningless and full of suffering. This view is exemplified by Arthur Schopenhauer and Philipp Mainl\u00e4nder. Philosophical pessimism is often accompanied by misanthropy if the proponent holds that humanity is also bad and partially responsible for the negative value of the world. However, the two views do not require each other and can be held separately. A non-misanthropic pessimist may hold, for instance, that humans are just victims of a terrible world but not to blame for it. Eco-misanthropists, by contrast, may claim that the world and its nature are valuable but that humanity exerts a negative and destructive influence.\nAntinatalism and human extinction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHumanity is a moral disaster. There would have been much less destruction had we never evolved. The fewer humans there are in the future, the less destruction there will still be.\n\u2014David Benatar, \"The Misanthropic Argument for Anti-natalism\"\nAntinatalism is the view that coming into existence is bad and that humans have a duty to abstain from procreation. A central argument for antinatalism is called the misanthropic argument. It sees the deep flaws of humans and their tendency to cause harm as a reason for avoiding the creation of more humans. These harms include wars, genocides, factory farming, and damages done to the environment. This argument contrasts with philanthropic arguments, which focus on the future suffering of the human about to come into existence. They argue that the only way to avoid their future suffering is to prevent them from being born. The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement and the Church of Euthanasia are well-known examples of social movements in favor of antinatalism and human extinction.\nAntinatalism is commonly endorsed by misanthropic thinkers. However, there are numerous other ways that could lead to the involuntary extinction of the human species, with various suggestions having been made about threats to the long-term survival of the human species, including nuclear wars, self-replicating nanorobots, or super-pathogens. While such cases can be seen as terrible scenarios for all life, misanthropes may instead interpret them as reasons for hope that the dominance of humanity in history will eventually come to an end. A similar sentiment is expressed by Bertrand Russell. He states in relation to the existence of human life on earth and its misdeeds that they are \"a passing nightmare; in time the earth will become again incapable of supporting life, and peace will return.\"\nHuman exceptionalism and deep ecology.\nHuman exceptionalism is the claim that human beings have unique importance and are exceptional compared to all other species. It is often based on the claim that they stand out because of their special capacities, like intelligence, rationality, and autonomy. In religious contexts, it is frequently explained in relation to a unique role that God foresaw for them or that they were created in God's image. Human exceptionalism is usually combined with the claim that human well-being matters more than the well-being of other species. This line of thought can be used to draw various ethical conclusions. One is the claim that humans have the right to rule the planet and impose their will on other species. Another is that inflicting harm on other species may be morally acceptable if it is done with the purpose of promoting human well-being and excellence.\nGenerally speaking, the position of human exceptionalism is at odds with misanthropy in relation to the value of humanity. But this is not necessarily the case and it may be possible to hold both positions at the same time. One way to do this is to claim that humanity is exceptional because of a few rare individuals but that the average person is bad. Another approach is to hold that human beings are exceptional in a negative sense: given their destructive and harmful history, they are much worse than any other species.\nTheorists in the field of deep ecology are also often critical of human exceptionalism and tend to favor a misanthropic perspective. Deep ecology is a philosophical and social movement that stresses the inherent value of nature and advocates a radical change in human behavior toward nature. Various theorists have criticized deep ecology based on the claim that it is misanthropic by privileging other species over humans. For example, the deep ecology movement Earth First! faced severe criticism when they praised the AIDS epidemic in Africa as a solution to the problem of human overpopulation in their newsletter.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

When his maternal uncle became Pope Eugene IV, Barbo switched from training to be a merchant to religious studies. His rise in the Church was relatively rapid. Elected pope in 1464, Paul amassed a great collection of art and antiquities.\nEarly life.\nPietro Barbo was born in Venice, the son of Niccol\u00f2 Barbo and wife Polissena Condulmer. His mother was the sister of Pope Eugene IV (1431\u20131447). Through his father he was a member of the noble Barbo family. His adoption of the spiritual career, after having been trained as a merchant, was prompted by his uncle's election as pope. His consequent promotion was rapid. He became Archdeacon of Bologna, and Bishop of Cervia and of Vicenza, and in 1440 became a cardinal-deacon. While he was in Rome, Vicenza was administered by his brother, Paolo Barbo. Barbo gained popularity through his generosity. He might have boasted that if elected pope he would buy each cardinal a villa to escape the summer heat.\nAfter having been lay abbot of Santa Maria in Sylvis since 1441, in 1445 he succeeded Giuliano Cesarini as archpriest of the Vatican Basilica. Barbo was very influential under Eugene IV, Nicholas V, and Calixtus III, but less so under Pius II. Barbo had a marked propensity to enjoy dressing up in sumptuous ecclesiastical finery.\nElection.\nBarbo was elected to succeed Pope Pius II by the accessus in the first ballot of the papal conclave of 30 August 1464 with a majority of fourteen of the nineteen cardinals present. He owed his election in part to the dissatisfaction of some of the cardinals with the policy of his predecessor.\nUpon taking office, Paul II was to convene an ecumenical council within three years. But these terms of subscription were modified by Paul II at his own discretion, and this action lost him the confidence of the College of Cardinals. The justification for setting aside the capitulations, seen to be under way by the Duke of Milan's ambassador as early as 21 September, lay in connecting any abridgement of the Pope's absolute monarchy in the Papal States with a consequent abridgement of his sole authority in spiritual matters. Almost from his coronation, Paul withdrew and became inaccessible: audiences were only granted at night and even good friends waited a fortnight to see him. His suspiciousness was widely attested.\nPaul wore rouge in public. The story of Cardinal Ammanati that he meant to take the name Formosus II (meaning \"handsome\"), after Pope Formosus, but was persuaded not to, is more often repeated than the story that he was dissuaded from \"Marcus\", being Venetian and the Cardinal of San Marco, because it was also the war-cry of Venice. He had a papal tiara made for his own use studded with \"diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, topaz, large pearls, and every kind of precious gem\". He built the Palazzo San Marco (now the Palazzo Venezia) and lived there even as pope, amassing a great collection of art and antiquities.\nConflict.\nA sore point was his abuse of the practice of creating cardinals \"in pectore\", without publishing their names. Eager to raise new cardinals to increase the number who were devoted to his interests, but restricted by the terms of the capitulation, which gave the college a voice in the creation of new members, in the winter of 1464\u201365 Paul created two secret cardinals both of whom died before their names could be published. In his fourth year as Pope, he created eight new cardinals on 18 September 1467. Five were candidates pressed by kings, placating respectively James II of Cyprus, Edward IV of England, Louis XI of France, Matthias Corvinus of Hungary and Ferdinand I of Naples; one was the able administrator of the Franciscans; and the last two elevated his old tutor and a first cardinal-nephew. Two further cardinal-nephews were added on 21 November 1468. In a sign of his increasing secretiveness and paranoia, he added two more cardinals secretly at the same consistory, and four more at the beginning of 1471, expecting to reveal them only in his testament.\nTensions came to the fore when in attempting to eliminate redundant offices, Paul II proceeded to annul the college of Abbreviators, whose function it was to formulate papal documents; a storm of indignation arose, inasmuch as rhetoricians and poets with humanist training, had long been accustomed to benefiting from employment in such positions. Paul proceeded as well against the Roman Academy. Bartolomeo Platina was a member of both and found his papal employment abruptly curtailed. He wrote a pamphlet insolently demanding the pope recall his restrictions, and was imprisoned in the winter of 1464, but released four months later.\nIn February 1468, when Rome was rife with political intrigue fomented by the Roman barons and the neighboring princes, Paul II arrested Platina and other members of the academy on charges of irreligion, immorality, and an alleged conspiracy to assassinate the Pope. The prisoners were interrogated under torture and eventually released.\nAfter his release on 7 July 1469, Platina expected to be again in the employ of Paul II, who, however, declined his services. Platina threatened vengeance and executed his threat, when at the suggestion of Pope Sixtus IV he later wrote his \"Vit\u00e6 Pontificum Platin\u00e6 historici liber de vita Christi ac omnium pontificum qui hactenus ducenti fuere et XX\" (1479). Not unaccountably, Platina set forth an unfavorable delineation of the character of Paul II.\nAmong other things, Platina reported that Pius II suggested Barbo should have been called \"Maria Pietissima\", as \"when he could not obtain what he aimed at by praying, entreating, and requesting, he would join tears to his petitions to make them the sooner believed.\" Some historians have suggested the nickname may also have been a possible allusion to a perceived lack of masculinity, reflecting possible homosexuality. Platina also paints his enemy as cruel, and an archenemy of science. For centuries it influenced historical opinions until critical research proved otherwise.\nThough Platina's writing after the conflict would tarnish the legacy of Paul II, the conflict would prove to have a greater effect on the intellectual environment of Rome. Peter Partner explains, \"Probably its most important result was to convince men of letters that cultural conformity would be enforced in Rome.\" More tangibly, after the crackdown of Paul II, the Roman Academy took on a more religious flavour, turning in part to theology as a means of legitimizing its pursuits.\nFinal years.\nPope Paul rejected George of Pod\u011bbrady (King George of Bohemia) because he upheld the conventions of the Council of Basel in favour of the Utraquists. In August 1465, Paul II summoned George before the Roman tribunal. When the King failed to come, Paul allied himself with the insurgents in Bohemia and released the King's subjects from their oath of allegiance. In December 1466, he pronounced the ban of excommunication and sentence of deposition against George. George's apologist, Gregory of Heimberg, subsequently accused Paul of immorality, a move that resulted in Gregory's own excommunication.\nJust when the King's goodwill disposed the Pope in favor of reconciliation, Paul died suddenly of a heart attack on 26 July 1471. Reports of the death varied. Some claimed he had collapsed from severe indigestion after eating melon in excess. Some (mainly the pontiff's critics) said that he had died whilst being sodomized by a page boy. Nevertheless, his death resulted in the creation of a power vacuum in Central Europe \u2013 especially after Pod\u011bbrady himself died in March of that same year.\nLegacy.\nAlthough Paul II was a committed opponent of humanist learning, he oversaw and approved the introduction of printing into the Papal States, first at Subiaco in 1464 by Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim, and at Rome itself in 1467. The result was that books and other documents became far more numerous and less expensive to procure than the previous handwritten manuscripts. Printing put the materials needed for an advanced education into the hands of more people than ever before, including an increasing number of laypeople. The output of printing presses at this period was, as a matter of course, subject to governmental scrutiny; during Paul II's reign, books produced in the Papal States were largely limited to Latin classical literature and ecclesiastical texts.\nThe chronicler Stefano Infessura's republican and anti-papal temper makes his diary a far from neutral though well-informed witness. But it is certain that although Paul II opposed the humanists, he yet provided for popular amusements: in 1466 he permitted the horse-race that was a feature of Carnival to be run along the main street, the Via Lata, which became known from this annual event as the Via del Corso. So that nobody felt left out of the event, the Pope instituted races for boys, adult men, old people and Jews, with appropriate prizes for each group. He tried to reduce or stop blood feuds and vendettas in Italy, and to make sure that Jews were treated fairly. Paul II displayed an extravagant love of personal splendor that gratified his sense of self-importance. After his death Sixtus IV and a selected group of cardinals inspected the treasure laid up against expenditures against the Turks: they found 54 silver shells filled with pearls, to a value of 300,000 ducats, jewels and gold intended for refashioning, worth another 300,000 ducats, and a magnificent diamond worth 7,000 ducats, which was sent to Cardinal d'Estouteville to cover monies he had advanced to the pontiff. The coin was not immediately found. He had also amassed a collection of 800 gemstones.\nWilliam Francis Barry considers that his character was \"misunderstood by the Italian courts which never dreamt that a Pope could be an honourable man\".\nIn statecraft, Paul II lacked eminence and achieved nothing of consequence for Italy. In his own domain, however, he terminated the regime of the counts of Anguillara in 1465.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47177", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47177", "title": "Ruddigore", "text": "1887 comic opera by Gilbert &amp; Sullivan\nRuddigore; or, The Witch's Curse, originally called Ruddygore, is a comic opera in two acts, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert. It is one of the Savoy Operas and the tenth of fourteen comic operas written together by Gilbert and Sullivan. It was first performed by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Savoy Theatre in London on 22 January 1887.\nThe first night was not altogether a success, as critics and the audience felt that \"Ruddygore\" (as it was then called) did not measure up to its predecessor, \"The Mikado\". After some changes, including respelling the title, it achieved a run of 288 performances. The piece was profitable, and the reviews were not all bad. For instance, \"The Illustrated London News\" praised the work of both Gilbert and, especially, Sullivan: \"Sir Arthur Sullivan has eminently succeeded alike in the expression of refined sentiment and comic humour. In the former respect, the charm of graceful melody prevails; while, in the latter, the music of the most grotesque situations is redolent of fun.\"\nThere were further changes and cuts, including a new overture, when Rupert D'Oyly Carte revived \"Ruddigore\" after the First World War. Although never a big money-spinner, it remained in the repertoire until the company closed in 1982. A centenary revival at Sadler's Wells in London restored the opera to almost its original first-night state. In 2000, Oxford University Press published a scholarly edition of the score and libretto, edited by Sullivan scholar David Russell Hulme. This restores the work as far as possible to the state in which its authors left it and includes a substantial introduction that explains many of the changes, with appendices containing some music deleted early in the run. After the expiration of the British copyright on Gilbert and Sullivan works in 1961, and especially since the Sadler's Wells production and recording, various directors have experimented with restoring some or all of the cut material in place of the 1920s D'Oyly Carte version.\nBackground.\nAfter \"The Mikado\" opened in 1885, Gilbert, as usual, promptly turned his thoughts to finding a subject for a next opera. Some of the plot elements of \"Ruddigore\" had been introduced by Gilbert in his earlier one-act opera, \"Ages Ago\" (1869), including the tale of the wicked ancestor and the device of the ancestors stepping out of their portraits. Heinrich Marschner's 1828 opera, \"Der Vampyr\", involves a Lord Ruthven who must abduct and sacrifice three maidens or die. Locals claim that the Murgatroyd ancestors in \"Ruddigore\" are based on the Murgatroyd family of East Riddlesden Hall, West Yorkshire. According to his biographers, Sidney Dark and Rowland Grey, Gilbert also drew on some of his earlier verse, the \"Bab Ballads\", for some plot elements. The song \"I know a youth who loves a little maid\" can be traced back to the Bab Ballad \"The Modest Couple\", in which the very shy and proper Peter and Sarah are betrothed but are reluctant to shake hands or sit side by side. Sir Roderic's Act II song \"When the night wind howls\" had its forerunner in one of Gilbert's verses published in \"Fun\" magazine in 1869:\n&lt;poem&gt;Fair phantom, come! The moon's awake,\nThe owl hoots gaily from its brake,\nThe blithesome bat's a-wing.\nCome, soar to yonder silent clouds;\nThe ether teems with peopled shrouds:\nWe'll fly the lightsome spectre crowds,\nThou cloudy, clammy thing!&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe opera also includes and parodies elements of melodrama, popular at the Adelphi Theatre. There is a priggishly good-mannered poor-but-virtuous heroine, a villain who carries off the maiden, a hero in disguise and his faithful old retainer who dreams of their former glory days, the snake-in-the-grass sailor who claims to be following his heart, the wild, mad girl, the swagger of fire-eating patriotism, ghosts coming to life to enforce a family curse, and so forth. But Gilbert, in his customary topsy-turvy fashion, turns the moral absolutes of melodrama upside down: The hero becomes evil, the villain becomes good, and the virtuous maiden changes fianc\u00e9s at the drop of a hat. The ghosts come back to life, foiling the curse, and all ends happily.\nSullivan delayed in setting \"Ruddigore\" to music through most of 1886. He had committed to a heavy conducting schedule and to compose a cantata, \"The Golden Legend\", for the triennial Leeds Music Festival in October 1886. He also was squiring Fanny Ronalds to numerous social functions. Fortunately, \"The Mikado\" was still playing strongly, and Sullivan prevailed on Gilbert to delay production of \"Ruddigore\". He got down to business in early November, however, and rehearsals began in December. During the Act II ghost scene, it would be impossible for the cast to see Sullivan's baton when the stage was darkened for the Ancestors' reincarnation. A technological solution was found: Sullivan used a glass tube baton containing a platinum wire that glowed a dull red.\nThe opera encountered some criticism from audiences at its opening on 22 January 1887, and one critic wondered if the libretto showed \"signs of the failing powers of the author\". After a run shorter than any of the earlier Gilbert and Sullivan operas premiered at the Savoy except \"Princess Ida\", \"Ruddigore\" closed in November 1887 to make way for a revival of \"H.M.S. Pinafore\". To allow the revival of the earlier work to be prepared at the Savoy, the last two performances of \"Ruddigore\" were given at the Crystal Palace, on 8 and 9 November. It was not revived in the lifetimes of the composer or author.\nSynopsis.\nAct I.\nIn the town of Rederring, in Cornwall, a chorus of professional bridesmaids frets that there have been no weddings for the last six months. All of the eligible young men are hopeful of a union with Rose Maybud, the prettiest maiden in the village, yet they are too timid to approach her. The desperate bridesmaids ask Rose's aunt, Dame Hannah, if she would consider marrying, but she has vowed to remain eternally single. Many years previously, she had been betrothed to \"a god-like youth\" who turned out to be Sir Roderic Murgatroyd, one of the bad baronets of Ruddigore. Only on her wedding day had she discovered his true identity.\nDame Hannah tells the bridesmaids about the curse of Ruddigore. Centuries ago, Sir Rupert Murgatroyd, the first Baronet of Ruddigore, had persecuted witches. One of his victims, as she was burnt at the stake, cursed all future Baronets of Ruddigore to commit a crime every day, or perish in inconceivable agonies. Every Baronet of Ruddigore since then had fallen under the curse's influence, and died in agony once he could no longer bring himself to continue a life of crime.\nAfter the horrified bridesmaids exit, Dame Hannah greets her niece, Rose, and asks whether there is any young man in the village whom she could love. Rose, who takes her ideas of Right and Wrong from a book of etiquette, replies that all of the young men she meets are either too rude or too shy. Dame Hannah asks particularly about Robin Oakapple, a virtuous farmer, but Rose replies that he is too diffident to approach her, and the rules of etiquette forbid her from speaking until she is spoken to. Robin enters, claiming to seek advice from Rose about \"a friend\" who is in love. Rose says that she has such a friend too, but Robin is too shy to take the hint. Rose's devotion to etiquette prevents her from taking the first step, and so they part.\nOld Adam, Robin's faithful servant, arrives and addresses Robin as Sir Ruthven (pronounced \"Rivven\") Murgatroyd. Robin reveals that he is indeed Sir Ruthven, having fled his home twenty years previously to avoid inheriting the Baronetcy of Ruddigore and its attendant curse. He tells Adam never to reveal his true identity. Now Richard Dauntless, Robin's foster-brother, arrives after ten years at sea. Robin tells him that he is afraid to declare his love to Rose, and Richard offers to speak to her on his behalf. When Richard sees Rose, however, he falls in love with her himself and proposes immediately. After consulting her book of etiquette, Rose accepts. When Robin finds out what has happened, he points out his foster-brother's many flaws through a series of backhanded compliments. Realising her mistake, Rose breaks her engagement with Richard and accepts Robin.\nMad Margaret appears, dishevelled and crazed. She has been driven to madness by her love for Sir Despard Murgatroyd, the \"Bad Baronet\". She is jealously seeking Rose Maybud, having heard that Sir Despard intends to carry Rose off as one of his daily \"crimes\". Rose tells her, however, that she need not fear, as she is pledged to another. They leave just in time to avoid the arrival of the Bucks and Blades, who have come to court the village girls, followed by Sir Despard, who proceeds to frighten everyone away. He muses that, although he is forced by the family curse to commit a heinous crime every day, he commits the crime early, and for the rest of the day he does good works. Richard approaches him and discloses that Despard's elder brother Ruthven is alive, calls himself Robin Oakapple, and is going to marry Rose later that day. The elated Despard declares himself free of the curse, as he can now transfer the baronetcy to his brother.\nThe village gathers to celebrate the nuptials of Rose and Robin. Sir Despard interrupts, revealing that Robin is his elder brother and must accept his rightful title as the Bad Baronet. Rose, horrified at Robin's true identity, resolves to marry Despard \u2013 who refuses her: now free of the curse, the ex-baronet takes up with his old love and fianc\u00e9e Mad Margaret, who is ecstatic. Rose then accepts Richard, as he \"is the only one that's left.\" Robin leaves to take up his rightful identity as Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd.\nAct II.\nAt Ruddigore Castle, Robin (now Sir Ruthven) tries to come to grips with being a bad baronet, a task at which he proves to be spectacularly lacking. Old Adam suggests various evil crimes, but Robin prefers minor acts that are not criminal, but \"simply rude\". Richard and Rose enter to ask Robin's consent to their marriage, which he gives grudgingly.\nRobin's weak crimes stir his ancestral ghosts from their usual haunt of the castle's portrait gallery. The curse requires them to ensure that their successors are duly committing a crime every day, and to torture them to death if they fail. They inquire as to Robin's compliance with this requirement. They are not pleased to learn that the newly-recognised baronet's crimes range from the underwhelming (filing a false income tax return: \"Nothing at all\", say the ghosts; \"Everybody does that. It's expected of you.\") to the ridiculous (forging his own will and disinheriting his unborn son). Robin's uncle, the late Sir Roderic Murgatroyd, orders him to \"carry off a lady\" that day or perish in horrible agony. After the ghosts treat him to a sample of the agonies he would face, Robin reluctantly agrees. He tells Adam to go to the village and abduct a lady \u2013 \"Any lady!\"\nDespard, meanwhile, has atoned for his previous ten years of evil acts and has married Mad Margaret. The two of them now live a calm, dispassionate life of moderately-paid public service. They come to the castle and urge Robin to renounce his life of crime. When Robin asserts that he has done no wrong yet, they remind him that he is morally responsible for all the crimes Despard had done in his stead. Realising the extent of his guilt, Robin resolves to defy his ancestors.\nAdam has now complied with Robin's orders but has unfortunately chosen to abduct Dame Hannah. The dame proves formidable indeed, and Robin cries out for his uncle's protection. Sir Roderic duly appears, recognises his former love and, angered that his former fianc\u00e9e has been abducted, dismisses Robin. Left alone, he and Dame Hannah enjoy a brief reunion. Robin interrupts them, accompanied by Rose, Richard and the bridesmaids. He quibbles that, under the terms of the curse, a Baronet of Ruddigore can die only by refusing to commit a daily crime. Refusing is therefore \"tantamount to suicide\", but suicide is, itself, a crime. Thus, he reasons, his predecessors \"ought never to have died at all.\"* Roderic follows this logic and agrees, stating that he is \"practically\" alive.\nNow that Robin is free of the curse, Rose once again drops Richard and happily resumes her engagement to Robin. Roderic and Dame Hannah embrace, while Richard settles for the First Bridesmaid, Zorah.\nPremiere and reception.\nThe first night was not as successful as the other Savoy opera premieres because of controversy over the title and the revivification of the ghosts, and reservations about the plot and music. According to the \"St James's Gazette\", \"The first act was well received by the audience. Number after number was rapturously encored, and every droll sally of dialogue was received with a shout of appreciative mirth.\" The interval was long (a half hour) as the elaborate picture gallery needed to be set up, but D'Oyly Carte had anticipated this and had printed indulgence slips which were distributed. It was marked by noisy hubbub when Lord Randolph Churchill was spotted in the crowd, but a loud shout of \"No politics!\" brought relative calm. The second act, however, ended badly. On 23 January 1887, under the heading \"Their First Flat Failure; The First Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Not a Success\", \"The New York Times\" reported, \"When the curtain finally fell there was hissing \u2013 the first ever heard in the Savoy Theatre. The audience even voiced sentiments in words and there were shouts and cries such as these: 'Take off this rot!' 'Give us \"The Mikado\"!'\" The paper added, \"(T)he name is decidedly against it.\"\nThe performance was hampered by an off night for Leonora Braham as Rose Maybud and by George Grossmith's usual first night jitters, a week after which he fell dangerously ill and had to be replaced by his understudy, Henry Lytton, for almost three weeks. Sullivan noted in his diary, \"Production of \"Ruddigore\" [\"sic\"] at Savoy. Very enthusiastic up to the last 20 minutes, then the audience showed dissatisfaction.\"\nCritical reception.\nOn the day of the premiere, \"The New York Times\", whose correspondent attended the dress rehearsal the day before, warned, \"The music is not up to the standard of Sir Arthur Sullivan. As a whole it is largely commonplace ... Gilbert's dialogue in the first act is here and there very amusing, but in the second it is slow and tedious.\" The press generally agreed with the Savoy audience that the second act of the premiere was inferior to the first. \"The Times\" opined that \"the fun which runs alive in the first act runs completely dry in the second, which is long and tedious, and winds up with an anti-climax of inanity.\" \"The Times\" praised both the libretto and the music of the first act (\"Everything sparkles with the flashes of Mr. Gilbert's wit and the graces of Sir Arthur Sullivan's melodiousness... one is almost at a loss what to select for quotation from an embarrassment of humorous riches.\") but rated the score, as a whole, \"of a fair average kind, being not equal to \"The Sorcerer\" but certainly superior to \"Princess Ida\".\" \"Punch\" also thought the second act weak: \"The idea of the burlesque is funny to begin with, but not to go on with\". The \"Pall Mall Gazette\" thought the libretto \"as witty and fanciful as any of the series\" though \"the second half of the last act dragged a little.\" \"The New York Times\" reported, \"the second (act) fell flat from the beginning and was a gloomy and tedious failure.\" According to the \"St. James's Gazette\", \"gradually the enthusiasm faded away and the interest of the story began to flag, until at last the plot seemed within an ace of collapsing altogether.\"\n\"The Era\" commented, \"the libretto as a whole is very weak and loosely constructed.\" \"Fun\" asked, \"Could it be possible that we were to have a dull play from the cleverest and most original humorist of the day? Alas! It could \u2013 it was.\" According to the \"Pall Mall Budget\", \"the players seemed to be nervous from the start. Miss Braham forgot her lines, and was not in voice. Mr. (George) Grossmith was in the same plight\". \"The Times\" also criticised Braham, stating that she \"acted most charmingly, but sang persistently out of tune\". The staging was also criticised: \"The Times\" stated, \"The ghost scene ... of which preliminary notices and hints of the initiated had led one to expect much, was a very tame affair.\" \"The Era\" thought Sullivan's score \"far from being fresh and spontaneous as is his wont\".\nNot all newspapers were adversely critical. \"The Sunday Express\" headlined its review \"Another Brilliant Success\". \"The Sunday Times\" agreed and stated that the work was \"received with every demonstration of delight by a distinguished and representative audience.\" \"The Observer\" also praised the piece, though allowing that it \"lacks something of the sustained brilliance\" of \"The Mikado\". \"The Daily News\" applauded the innovation of Sullivan (who conducted, as usual, on the first night), of conducting with a baton tipped with a small incandescent light. Scholar Reginald Allen suggested that the reviews in the Sunday papers may have been better than the others because their critics, facing deadlines (the premiere was on Saturday night, and finished late because of the long interval), may not have stayed to the end. \"Fun\", having disparaged the libretto, said of the music, \"Sir Arthur has surpassed himself\". \"The Pall Mall Gazette\" praised the \"charming melodies, fresh and delightful as ever\"; \"The Daily News\" wrote that \"Mr Gilbert retains in all its fulness his unique facility for humorous satire and whimsical topsy-turveydom\" and praised Sullivan's \"melodic genius which never fails\". \"Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper\" said, \"Sir Arthur Sullivan must be congratulated.\"\nSubsequent reviews and reception.\nSubsequent reviews, written after Gilbert and Sullivan had renamed the show and made other changes, were generally more favourable. A week after the premiere, the \"Illustrated London News\" praised the work, the actors and both Gilbert and, especially, Sullivan: \"Sir Arthur Sullivan has eminently succeeded alike in the expression of refined sentiment and comic humour. In the former respect, the charm of graceful melody prevails; while, in the latter, the music of the most grotesque situations is redolent of fun.\" On 1 February 1887, \"The Theatre\" wrote, \"There can be no doubt that by its admirable production of Messrs. Gilbert and Sullivan's latest work the Savoy management has scored another of those shining and remunerative successes that its enterprise, intelligence, and good taste have repeatedly achieved \u2013 and merited.\" A week later, \"The Academy\" reckoned that \"Ruddygore\" (as it was still called in the review) was probably not so good as \"Patience\" or \"The Mikado\", nor as \"fresh\" as \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", but \"it is better than ... \"Princess Ida\", the \"Pirates\", and \"Iolanthe\"\". \"The Musical Times\" called the work \"one of the most brilliant examples which the associated art of Messrs. Gilbert and Sullivan has brought into existence,\" and said that Sullivan had \"written some of his freshest and most delightful melodies.\" However, in the view of \"The Manchester Guardian\", reviewing the Manchester premiere in March 1887, \"The weakness of his central idea has led Mr Gilbert into extravagance without wit and parody without point.\"\nOn 5 February 1887, \"The New York Times\" reported the change of name to \"Ruddigore.\" \"In consequence of the criticisms on the piece, the second act has been changed. The pictures, with the exception of one, no longer come down from their frames. The houses are packed, as they always are in London, but the opinion is universal that the thing will be a worse failure in the provinces and America than \"Iolanthe\".\" In a letter cabled to \"The New York Times\" and printed on 18 February, Richard D'Oyly Carte denied that the piece was a failure, stating that box office receipts were running ahead of the same time period for \"The Mikado\", despite the absence of the ailing Grossmith, who was by then recovering. He acknowledged that there had been \"isolated hisses\" on the first night because some audience members did not like the reappearance of the ghosts or a reference to the \"Supreme Court\" (according to D'Oyly Carte, misunderstood as \"Supreme Being\") but asserted that both objections had been addressed by the removal of the offending material, and that audience reaction had been otherwise enthusiastic. He added, \"The theatre is crammed nightly.\"\nThe American productions met with mixed success. The demand for tickets for the first night was so great that the management of the Fifth Avenue Theatre sold them by public auction. A \"large and brilliant\" audience assembled for the New York premiere on 21 February 1887. \"After the first half of the first act there was a palpable diminution of interest on the part of the audience, and it must be admitted that there were times during the course of the evening when people were bored.\" While the critic had praise for many members of the cast and felt the production would improve once the cast was more familiar with the work, the reviewer concluded that \"Gilbert and Sullivan have failed.\" On the other hand, the American tour, beginning in Philadelphia six days later, met with a much more favourable audience reaction. \"That the opera is a great success here and another \"Mikado\" in prospective popularity there can be no question... The general verdict is that Sullivan never composed more brilliant music, while Gilbert's keen satire and pungent humor is [\"sic\"] as brilliant as ever.\" During the summer of 1886, Braham secretly married J. Duncan Young, previously a principal tenor with the company. In early 1887, shortly into the run of \"Ruddigore\", Braham informed Carte that she was pregnant with her second child, a daughter, who would be born on 6 May. Geraldine Ulmar, the Rose in the New York cast, was summoned to London to take over the role.\nGilbert ranked \"Ruddigore\" along with \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" and \"Utopia, Limited\" as one of his three favourite Savoy operas. Later assessments have found much merit in the piece. After it was revived by the D'Oyly Carte Opera company in 1920, the work remained in their regular repertory, and it has generally been given a place in the regular rotation of other Gilbert and Sullivan repertory companies. By 1920, in a reappraisal of the piece, Samuel Langford wrote in \"The Manchester Guardian\" that \"the gruesome strain is the real Gilbertian element\" but \"the opera has abundant charm among its more forbidding qualities\". In 1934 Hesketh Pearson rated the libretto among Gilbert's best. In a 1937 review, \"The Manchester Guardian\" declared, \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is incomprehensible that \"Ruddigore\" should ever have been considered less attractive than the other comic operas in the Savoy series. The libretto gives us Gilbert at his wittiest, and in the music we hear Sullivan not only in his most tuneful vein but also as a master of more subtle rhythms than he commands elsewhere. Moreover, the parody is one that all can enjoy to the full, for here the satire is not pointed at a coterie, nor at this or that \u00e6sthetic movement, but at the absurdities of a melodramatic tradition which is nearly as old as the stage itself.\nIn 1984, Arthur Jacobs rated \"Ruddigore\" \"One of the weaker of Gilbert's librettos, it was seen (especially after the freshness of invention in \"The Mikado\") to be rather obviously relying on brushed-up ideas... The plot is supposedly a burlesque of what was 'transpontine' melodrama... But that brand of melodrama was itself hardly alive enough to be made fun of. As the \"Weekly Dispatch\" put it: 'If stage work of the kind caricatured in \"Ruddygore or The Witch's Curse\" is not extinct, it is relegated to regions unfrequented by the patrons of Mr D'Oyly Carte's theatre'.\"\nAnalysis of music and text.\nMusical content.\nThe Sullivan scholar Gervase Hughes characterised Sir Roderic's song \"When the night wind howls\" as \"unquestionably the finest piece of descriptive music that Sullivan ever wrote, worthy of a place beside Schubert's \"Erlk\u00f6nig\", Wagner's overture to \"The Flying Dutchman\", and well above Saint-Sa\u00ebns' \"Danse macabre\", all of which are tone-paintings in a similar colour. Although the vocal score gives not a hint of the uncanny brilliance of the orchestration, it demonstrates the sure footholds by which the music in a round dozen bars finds its way from D minor to A flat major and back and the shattering impact of the fortissimo chorus entry at an interrupted cadence on the chord of B flat major. The progressions that follow [represent] an apotheosis of [Sullivan's] matured harmonic resource.\"\nVersions.\nChanges during the initial run.\nAfter the unfavourable reception that the opera received on opening night, Gilbert and Sullivan made numerous significant cuts and alterations: Sullivan recorded in his diary:\nGilbert and Sullivan made the following changes:\nThe original vocal score, published in March 1887, represented this revised version of the musical text. A 1987 recording by the New Sadler's Wells Opera, for which David Russell Hulme was adviser, restored most of the surviving material from the first-night version, including \"For thirty-five years I've been sober and wary\", as well as the extra music from the ghost scene. The recording and the production were based in part on Hulme's research, which also led to the 2000 Oxford University Press edition of the \"Ruddigore\" score, in which the music for some passages was published for the first time.\nRevisions in the 1920s.\n\"Ruddigore\" was not revived professionally during the authors' lifetimes. When it received its first professional revival in December 1920 in Glasgow \u2013 and then in London, in October 1921 \u2013 the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made a number of further cuts and changes that were incorporated in scores and used in subsequent D'Oyly Carte productions and recordings. David Russell Hulme, editor of the Oxford University Press 2000 scholarly edition of the score, has attributed the cuts and other changes to the music principally to Harry Norris, musical director of the D'Oyly Carte at the time of the Glasgow revival, and the modifications to the opera's orchestration, as well as the new overture, to Geoffrey Toye. He concluded that some lesser changes may have been made by Malcolm Sargent, but in a few cases Hulme was uncertain as to which conductor was responsible for which change.\nThe most conspicuous changes were as follows:\nThe standard Chappell vocal score was revised in the late 1920s to reflect these changes, except that the \"Melodrame\" and \"The battle's roar is over\" continued to be printed. The G. Schirmer vocal score published in America agreed with the revised Chappell score, except that it also included Robin's Act II recitative and patter song \"Henceforth all the crimes\" and both versions of the Act II finale. The publication of the Oxford University Press edition in 2000 made it easier to restore passages deleted from the opera. Due to the many different editions available and the work's complex textual history, there is no standard performing version of \"Ruddigore\". Comparing the two extant overtures, Gervase Hughes wrote:\n[T]he original overture to \"Ruddigore\" ... is a crude \"selection\" hardly redeemed by its spirited ending. The final cadence is by no means typical of Sullivan. In this overture a \"double chorus\" ... is taken complete from the opera \u2013 an unsatisfactory move because it vitiates its effect in the proper place. Nor is the orchestration of the passage particularly skilful. ... When \"Ruddigore\" was revived after some thirty-four years this jumble was found unsuitable ... and a new overture (which has been used ever since) was written by Geoffrey Toye. No precedents were followed and there is nothing Sullivanesque about it except the actual tunes; if one of them is momentarily developed in a manner that suggests a haunted ballroom rather than a haunted picture-gallery there is no great harm in that.\nProductions.\nIn contrast to its predecessor, \"The Mikado\", \"Ruddigore\" had a comparatively short original run of 288 performances. The provincial tour was very brief, closing by early June 1887. Gilbert designed the ladies' and principals' costumes himself, while C. Wilhelm created the Ancestors' costumes. The set was by Hawes Craven. Six portraits of the ancestors that appeared in Act II of the original London production have survived and are on display at Normansfield Hospital Entertainment Hall, southwest London. A production in New York with D'Oyly Carte personnel ran for 53 performances. The opera was not revived during Gilbert and Sullivan's lifetimes.\nThe first revival was in December 1920 in Glasgow, and the first London revival was the following year. The opera was cut and heavily revised, including a new overture and a new second-act finale. The revival was a success, and from that point on, \"Ruddigore\" was a permanent fixture in the D'Oyly Carte repertory until its closure in 1982. New costumes were designed by Percy Anderson in 1927. It was included in every season until the winter of 1940\u201341, when the scenery and costumes (along with those of three other operas) were destroyed in enemy action. In Australia, no authorised production of \"Ruddigore\" was seen until 23 June 1927, at the Theatre Royal, Adelaide, produced by the J. C. Williamson company. A new D'Oyly Carte production debuted on 1 November 1948, with new costumes and an Act II set designed by Peter Goffin. From then on, it was played in every season through 1976\u201377, aside from 1962\u201363 (a season that included a lengthy overseas tour). New touring sets were designed by Goffin in 1957. In the late 1970s, the Company started to play a reduced repertory. \"Ruddigore\" was included in the 1976\u201377 tour, then for five months in 1978\u20131979; and finally in 1981\u201382.\nIn 1987, the New Sadler's Wells Opera produced \"Ruddigore\" using a new edition of the text that restored many of the passages that prior productions had cut. Among recent professional productions, the Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company has mounted the opera at the Buxton Opera House, and both Britain's Opera North and America's New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players mounted well-regarded stagings in 2010. Opera North revived its production in 2011 and 2012.\nThe following table shows the history of the D'Oyly Carte productions in Gilbert's lifetime:\nHistorical casting.\nThe following tables show the casts of the principal original productions and D'Oyly Carte Opera Company touring repertory at approximately 10-year intervals through to the company's 1982 closure:\nRecordings.\nThe four D'Oyly Carte Opera Company recordings (1924, 1931, 1950, 1962) substantially reflect the 1920s cuts and alterations, although they differ in some details. None of these four recordings include Robin's Act II recitative and patter song. There is no commercial recording of \"Ruddigore\" as Gilbert and Sullivan left it, but the 1987 New Sadler's Wells recording largely presents the opera with the materials that were included on its first night.\nThe Gilbert and Sullivan Discography judges that the best commercial recording is the New Sadler's Wells disc and that, of those by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, the 1924 and 1962 recordings are best. It also asserts that the Brent Walker video of \"Ruddigore\" is one of the stronger entries in that series. More recent professional productions have been recorded on video by the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival.\nSelected recordings\nAdaptations and references in literature and culture.\nAdaptations of the opera have included the following.\nReferences in literature have included several novels in which the setting of the story involved a production of \"Ruddigore\", such as \"Murder and Sullivan\" by Sara Hoskinson Frommer (1997) and \"Ruddy Gore\" by Kerry Greenwood (2004; the 7th Phryne Fisher book). \"The Ghosts' High Noon\" by John Dickson Carr (1969) was named for the song of the same name in \"Ruddigore\". In \"Runaround\", a story from Isaac Asimov's \"I, Robot\", a robot in a state similar to drunkenness sings snippets of \"There Grew a Little Flower\". In chapter 12 of John Myers Myers' novel \"Silverlock\" Sir Despard appears and admits that he fakes his evil acts; the locals are so used to this that he needs to pay the girls extra to scream when abducted.\nPlot elements from G&amp;S operas entered subsequent musicals; for example, 1937's \"Me and My Girl\" features a portrait gallery of ancestors that, like the portraits in \"Ruddigore\", come alive to remind their descendant of his duty. The \"Matter Patter\" trio is used (with some changed lyrics) in Papp's Broadway production of \"The Pirates of Penzance\", and the tune of the song is used as \"The Speed Test\" in the musical \"Thoroughly Modern Millie\". It is also sung in a season 5 episode of \"Spitting Image\" where Labour leader Neil Kinnock is portrayed singing a self-parody to the tune. The same song is pastiched in the documentary film \"\". In the \"Doctor Who\" Big Finish Productions audio, \"Doctor Who and the Pirates\", songs from \"Ruddigore\" and other G&amp;S operas are parodied.\n\"Ruddigore\" is mentioned in the law case of \"Banks v. District of Columbia Dep't of Consumer &amp; Regulatory Affairs\", 634 A.2d 433, 441 fn. 1 (D.C. 1993), which cites Ruddigore's admonition to \"blow your own trumpet\". A production of \"Ruddigore\" is the main plot point in \"Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries\", Season 1 Episode 6, \"Ruddy Gore\", based on the Phryne Fisher novel of the same name. The stars of the opera are being killed off in an effort to bankrupt the production company.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This was a major reason for his eventual disputes with Sigmund Freud.\nPrior to this conclusion, he was notable as a psychoanalyst for working with the most difficult of patients and for developing a theory of more active intervention than is usual for psychoanalytic practice. During the early 1920s, criticizing Freud's \"classical\" method of neutral interpretation, Ferenczi collaborated with Otto Rank to create a \"here-and-now\" psychotherapy that, through Rank's personal influence, led the American Carl Rogers to conceptualize person-centered therapy.\nFerenczi has found some favour in modern times among the followers of Jacques Lacan as well as among relational psychoanalysts in the United States. Relational analysts read Ferenczi as anticipating their own clinical emphasis on mutuality (intimacy), intersubjectivity, and the importance of the analyst's countertransference. Ferenczi's work has strongly influenced theory and praxis of the interpersonal-relational theory of American psychoanalysis, as typified by psychoanalysts at the William Alanson White Institute.\nFerenczi was president of the International Psychoanalytical Association from 1918 to 1919.\nErnest Jones, a biographer of Freud, termed Ferenczi as \"mentally ill\" at the end of his life, famously ignoring Ferenczi's struggle with pernicious anemia, which killed him in 1933. Though desperately ill with the then-untreatable disease, Ferenczi managed to deliver his most famous paper, \"Confusion of Tongues\" to the 12th International Psycho-Analytic Congress in Wiesbaden, Germany, on 4 September 1932.\nFerenczi's reputation was revived in 2002 by publication of \"Disappearing and Reviving: Sandor Ferenczi in the History of Psychoanalysis\". One of the book's chapters dealt with the nature of the relationship between Freud and Ferenczi.\nFerenczi's main ideas.\nActivity in psychoanalytic therapy.\nContrary to Freud's opinion of therapeutic abstinence, Ferenczi advocated a more active role for the analyst. For example, instead of the relative \"passivity\" of a listening analyst encouraging the patient to freely associate, Ferenczi used to curtail certain responses, verbal and non-verbal alike, on the part of the analysand so as to allow suppressed thoughts and feelings to emerge. described in a case study how he used a kind of behavioral activation (uncommon in the psychoanalytic therapy at that time) when he asked an opera singer with performance anxiety to \u201cperform\u201d during a therapy session and in this way to struggle with her fears.\nClinical empathy in psychoanalysis.\nFerenczi believed the empathic response during therapy was the basis of clinical interaction. He based his intervention on responding to the subjective experience of the analysand. If the more traditional opinion\nwas that the analyst had the role of a physician, administering a treatment to the patient based upon diagnostic judgment of psychopathology, Ferenczi wanted the analysand to become a co-participant in an encounter created by the therapeutic dyad. This emphasis on empathic reciprocity during the therapeutic encounter was an important contribution to the evolution of psychoanalysis. Ferenczi also believed that self-disclosure of the analyst is an important therapeutic reparative force. The practice of including the therapist's personality in therapy resulted in the development of the idea of mutual encounter: the therapist is allowed to discuss some content from his/her own life and thoughts, as long as it is relevant to the therapy. This is in contrast to the Freudian therapeutic abstinence according to which the therapist should not involve his/her personal life with the therapy, and should remain neutral. The mutual encounter is a precedent for the psychoanalytic theory of two-person psychology.\nThe \"confusion of tongues\" theory of trauma.\nFerenczi believed that the persistent traumatic effect of chronic overstimulation, deprivation, or empathic failure (a term further elaborated by Heinz Kohut) during childhood is what causes neurotic, character, borderline and psychotic disorders. According to this concept, trauma develops as a result of the sexual seduction of a child by a parent or authority figure. The confusion of tongues occurs when the child pretends to be the spouse of the parent. The pathological adult interprets this infantile and innocent game according to his adult \"passion tongue\" and then forces the child to conform to his passion tongue. The adult uses a tongue the child does not know, and interprets the child's innocent game (his infantile tongue) according to his disturbed perspective. For example, a father is playing with his little girl. During their common game, she offers him the role of her husband and wants him to sleep with her just as he sleeps with her mother. The pathological father misinterprets this childish offer, and touches his daughter in an inappropriate manner while they are in bed together. Here, the child spoke her innocent childish tongue, and the father interpreted her offer with his passionate adult sexual tongue.\nThe adult also attempts to convince the child that the lust on his part is really the love for which the child yearns. Ferenczi generalized the idea of trauma to emotional neglect, physical maltreatment, and empathic failure. The prominent manifestation of these disturbances would be the sexual abuse.\nA Lacanian reading of Ferenczi's 'Confusion of Tongues' was published in 2018 by Miguel Guti\u00e9rrez-Pel\u00e1ez. Raluca Soreanu has investigated the metapsychological implications of 'Confusion of Tongues' the \"Clinical Diary\" for a theory of psychic splitting.\n\"Regressus ad uterum\".\nIn \"Thalassa: A Theory of Genitality\" (, 1924), Ferenczi suggested that the wish to return to the womb () and the comfort of its amniotic fluids symbolizes a wish to return to the origin of life, the sea. This idea of an \"uterine and thalassal regression\" became a feature of the so-called Budapest School, up to the disciple Michael Balint and his 1937 paper on \"Primary [Object-]Love\". According to Ferenczi, all forms of human practice, especially sex, were an attempt to reestablish genitalia with the intrauterine experience \u2013 a theory which resonated with architect Richard Neutra and may have inspired, or supplemented, Neutra's fascination with uterine suspension. At the same time, \"Thalassa\" is embedded in discourses of popular biology, which are reinterpreted by Ferenczi by using psychoanalytic models. Far from simply leaning on Ernst Haeckel, Wilhelm B\u00f6lsche, and post-Lamarckism to bolster the psychoanalytic paradigm, Ferenczi defamiliarizes these popular discourses just at a time when they were starting to inform eugenicist projects.\nIn popular culture.\nKarl Graboshas portrays Ferenczi in episode 13 of season 15 \"Murdoch on the Couch\" (January 10, 2022) of the Canadian television period detective series \"Murdoch Mysteries\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

From 1965 through 1966 he served in the United States Army. He was married, twice, and had two children. He was active in science fiction fandom and in the early years of the Society for Creative Anachronism using the name \"Yang the Nauseating\", and co-initiated the society Great Dark Horde during 1971. He was also the initiator and an influential member of the Dorsai Irregulars. In 1976, he was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation for \"The Capture\", a cartoon slide show written by Asprin and drawn by Phil Foglio.\nEarly writing.\nAsprin's first novel, \"The Cold Cash War\", an expansion of an earlier short story of the same title, was published in 1977.\nDuring the next few years, he created and edited (with his then-wife, Lynn Abbey) the \"Thieves' World\" series of shared world anthologies, credited as the first project of its type. Many of the included authors later produced novels and stories of the theme which were not included in the anthologies, beginning with \"Beyond Sanctuary\" by Janet Morris, the first \"authorized\" Thieves World novel, published in 1985. Janet Morris and Chris Morris later produced two more authorized Thieves' World novels and a series of related novels about their character Tempus and the Sacred Band of Stepsons. A series of graphic novels followed during the mid-1980s, and several other authors, including Andrew J. Offutt and David Drake, published novels about their characters. In 2002, Lynn Abbey revived the series with the novel \"Sanctuary\".\nDuring 1978, Asprin began the \"MythAdventures\" series, chronicling the comic adventures of Skeeve and Aahz, with the book \"Another Fine Myth\". Illustrated originally by Frank Kelly Freas, and later by Phil Foglio, the pun-rich books concern a \"demon\" magician who has lost his powers and his inexperienced human apprentice as they travel through a variety of worlds. Some of the early \"Myth\" novels were adapted later as comic books by Foglio and others. The Myth books have been published by three publishing companies over the years: Donning Starblaze, Meisha Merlin and, as of 2008, Wildside Press.\nDuring the 1990s, Asprin's \"Phule\" novels concerned the humorous science-fiction exploits of a rag-tag \"Space Legion\" and its wealthy and iconoclastic commander, Willard Phule.\nHiatus in writing career.\nDue to a series of personal and financial problems, Asprin published little during the 1990s, although he had two books on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list, which piqued the interest of fans and the Internal Revenue Service. He eventually negotiated an agreement with the IRS that encouraged him to resume writing, and during the early 2000s he published several novels, mostly in collaboration with authors Peter Heck, Jody Lynn Nye, and Linda Evans. These novels included continuations of the series \"Myth Adventures\" and \"Phule's Company\" as well as works of new series.\nLater work.\nOne of Asprin's last projects was \"NO Quarter\", originally co-authored with Eric Del Carlo, and later edited by Teresa Patterson. It is a dark fantasy/suspense/murder mystery novel set in the author's beloved New Orleans French Quarter. Although the novel's fantasy elements (voodoo and black magic, tarot readings and precognition, ghosts and mysticism) are secondary to the brutal murder that is the emphasis of the plot, it is set in the same milieu as Asprin's Griffen McCandles novels (\"Dragons\" series), \"Dragons Luck\" and \"Dragons Wild\". The two protagonists of \"NO Quarter\", Maestro and Bone, also appear as minor characters of the \"Dragons\" novels. Maestro, the mysterious professional pool player and fencing master in \"NO Quarter\", is fictionalized but based recognizably on the author. \"NO Quarter\" was published November 2009 by DarkStar Books.\nAsprin's ofttimes co-author, Jody Lynn Nye, has completed one further Griffen McCandles novel, \"Dragons Deal\", and continued the \"Myth Adventures\" series. \"Dragons Deal\" was published by Ace in December 2010.\nDeath and aftermath.\nAsprin died on May 22, 2008, of heart failure at his home in New Orleans.

It is located 310 meters (1017.06 ft) above the sea level on the slope of Mount Caputo, a small promontory overlooking the valley of Palermo, from which it is approximately 7 km (4 miles) to the south. \nThe town developed on a site used by the Norman kings for hunting. They built a royal palace there, hence the name \"Mons Regalis\". The city gained great importance when king William II of Sicily built Monreale Cathedral with the adjoining Benedictine monastery. In 1183, it became the seat of the archbishop.\nMonreale forms its own archdiocese. Its cathedral is one of several buildings named in a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a group of nine inscribed as Arab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefal\u00f9 and Monreale.\nHistory.\nAfter the occupation of Palermo by the Arabs (the Emirate of Sicily), the Bishop of Palermo was forced to move his seat outside the capital. The role of a cathedral was assigned to a modest little church, \"Aghia Kiriaki\", in a nearby village later known as Monreale. After the Norman conquest in 1072, Christians took back the former Palermo cathedral. Probably the village's role as a temporary ecclesiastical centre played a part in King William II's decision to build a cathedral here.\nMonreale was a small village for a long time. When the Norman Kings of Sicily chose the area as their hunting resort, more people and commerce came to the area after the royalty built a palace (probably identifiable with the modern town hall).\nUnder King William II, a large monastery of Benedictines coming from Cava de' Tirreni, with its church, was founded and provided with large assets. The new construction also had an important defensive function. Monreale was the seat of the metropolitan archbishop of Sicily, which from then on exerted a significant influence over Sicily.\nIn the 19th century, underage marriages, or those performed without the blessing of the bride's parents, were known as \"the marriages of Monreale\", according to Eliza Lynn Linton. These referred to marriages performed in remote places, where the law was less observed. (see Gretna Green).\nMain sights.\nThe Cathedral.\nThe cathedral of Monreale is one of the greatest extant examples of Norman architecture. It was begun in 1174 by William II and completed four years later. In 1182 the church, dedicated to the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, was, by a bull of Pope Lucius III, elevated to the rank of a metropolitan cathedral.\nThe church is a national monument of Italy and one of the most important attractions of Sicily. Its size is 102 metres long and 47 meters wide. The fa\u00e7ade is characterized by two large towers (one partially destroyed by lightning in 1807) and a portal with Romanesque bronze doors decorated by Bonanno Pisano. The interior is on the Latin cross plan, divided by ogival arcades, and features fresco cycles executed during the reigns of William II and Tancred of Sicily (c. 1194). The cloister has 228 small columns, each with different decorations influenced by Proven\u00e7al, Burgundian, Arab and Salerno medieval art.\nInternational relations.\nMonreale is twinned with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47185", "revid": "50695608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47185", "title": "Ponzi scheme", "text": "Type of financial fraud\nA Ponzi scheme (, ) is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors. Named after Italian con artist Charles Ponzi, this type of scheme misleads investors by either falsely suggesting that profits are derived from legitimate business activities (whereas the business activities are non-existent), or by exaggerating the extent and profitability of the legitimate business activities, using new investments to fabricate or supplement these profits. A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as investors continue to contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment or lose faith in the non-existent assets they are purported to own.\nSome of the first recorded incidents to meet the modern definition of the Ponzi scheme were carried out from 1869 to 1872 by Adele Spitzeder in Germany and by Sarah Howe in the United States in the 1880s through the \"Ladies' Deposit\". Howe offered a solely female clientele an 8% monthly interest rate and then stole the money that the women had invested. She was eventually discovered and served three years in prison. The Ponzi scheme was also previously described in novels; Charles Dickens's 1844 novel \"Martin Chuzzlewit\" and his 1857 novel \"Little Dorrit\" both feature such a scheme.\nIn the 1920s, Charles Ponzi carried out this scheme and became well known throughout the United States because of the huge amount of money that he took in. His original scheme was purportedly based on the legitimate arbitrage of international reply coupons for postage stamps, but it proved infeasible, and he soon began diverting new investors' money to make payments to earlier investors and to himself. Unlike earlier similar schemes, Ponzi's gained considerable press coverage both within the United States and internationally both while it was being perpetrated and after it collapsed \u2013 this notoriety eventually led to the type of scheme being named after him.\nCharacteristics.\nIn a Ponzi scheme, a con artist offers investments that promise very high returns with little or no risk to an investor. The returns are said to originate from a business or a secret idea run by the con artist. In reality, the business does not exist or the idea does not work in the way it is described or the extent of returns is made up or exaggerated. The con artist pays the high returns promised to their earlier investors by using the money obtained from later investors. Instead of engaging in a legitimate business activity, the con artist attempts to attract new investors to make the payments that were promised to earlier investors. The operator of the scheme also diverts clients' funds for the operator's personal use.\nWith little or no legitimate earnings, Ponzi schemes require a constant flow of new money to survive. When it becomes hard to recruit new investors, or when large numbers of existing investors cash out, these schemes collapse. As a result, most investors end up losing much or all of the money they invested. In some cases, the operator of the scheme may simply disappear with the money.\nRed flags.\nAccording to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), many Ponzi schemes share characteristics that should be \"red flags\" for investors.\nAccording to criminologist Marie Springer, the following red flags can also be of relevance:\nMethods.\nTypically, Ponzi schemes require an initial investment and promise above-average returns. They use vague verbal guises such as \"hedge futures trading\", \"high-yield investment programs\", or \"offshore investment\" to describe their income strategy. It is common for the operator to take advantage of a lack of investor knowledge or competence, or sometimes claim to use a proprietary, secret investment strategy to avoid giving information about the scheme.\nThe basic premise of a Ponzi scheme is \"to rob Peter to pay Paul\". Initially, the operator pays high returns to attract investors and entice current investors to invest more money. When other investors begin to participate, a cascade effect begins. The schemer pays a \"return\" to initial investors from the investments of new participants, rather than from genuine profits.\nOften, high returns encourage investors to leave their money in the scheme, so that the operator does not actually have to pay very much to investors. The operator simply sends statements showing how much they have earned, which maintains the deception that the scheme is an investment with high returns. Investors within a Ponzi scheme may face difficulties when trying to get their money out of the investment.\nOperators also try to minimize withdrawals by offering new plans to investors where money cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time in exchange for higher returns. The operator sees new cash flows as investors cannot transfer money. If a few investors do wish to withdraw their money in accordance with the terms allowed, their requests are usually promptly processed, which gives the illusion to all other investors that the fund is solvent and financially sound.\nPonzi schemes sometimes begin as legitimate investment vehicles, such as hedge funds that can easily degenerate into a Ponzi-type scheme if they unexpectedly lose money or fail to legitimately earn the returns expected. The operators fabricate false returns or produce fraudulent audit reports instead of admitting their failure to meet expectations, from which point on the operation can be considered a Ponzi scheme.\nA wide variety of investment vehicles and strategies, typically legitimate, have become the basis of Ponzi schemes. For instance, Allen Stanford used bank certificates of deposit (CDs) to defraud tens of thousands of people. CDs are usually low-risk and insured instruments, but the Stanford CDs were fraudulent.\nUnraveling.\nTheoretically, it is possible for certain Ponzi schemes to ultimately \"succeed\" financially, at least as long as a Ponzi scheme was not what the promoters were initially intending to operate. For example, a failing hedge fund reporting fraudulent returns could conceivably \"make good\" its reported numbers, for example by making a successful high-risk investment. Moreover, if the operators of such a scheme are facing the likelihood of imminent collapse accompanied by criminal charges, they may see little additional \"risk\" to themselves in attempting to cover their tracks by engaging in further illegal acts to try and make good the shortfall (for example, by engaging in insider trading). Especially with investment vehicles like hedge funds that are regulated and monitored less heavily than other investment vehicles such as mutual funds, in the absence of a whistleblower or accompanying illegal acts, any fraudulent content in reports is often difficult to detect unless and until the investment vehicles ultimately implode.\nTypically, however, if a Ponzi scheme is not stopped by authorities, it falls apart for one or more of the following reasons:\nIn some cases, two or more of the aforementioned factors may be at play. For example, news of a police investigation into a Ponzi scheme may cause investors to immediately demand their money, and in turn cause the promoters to flee the jurisdiction sooner than planned (assuming they intended to eventually abscond in the first place), thus causing the scheme to collapse much faster than if the police investigation had simply been permitted to run its course.\nSimilar schemes.\nPyramid scheme.\nA pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return. However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes:\nCryptocurrency Ponzi.\nCryptocurrencies have been employed by scammers attempting a new generation of Ponzi schemes. For example, misuse of initial coin offerings, or \"ICOs\", has been one such method, known as \"smart Ponzis\" per the \"Financial Times\". Most schemes have a low recovery rate with investors losing their funds permanently. \nThe novelty of ICOs means that there is currently a lack of regulatory clarity on the classification of these financial devices, allowing scammers wide leeway to develop Ponzi schemes using these pseudo-assets. Also, the pseudonymity of cryptocurrency transactions and their international nature involving countless jurisdictions in many different countries can make it much more difficult to identify and take legal action (whether civil or criminal) against perpetrators.\nThe May 2022 collapse of TerraUSD, a stablecoin propped up by a complex algorithmic mechanism offering 20% yields, was described as \"Ponzinomics\" by \"Wired\". Another example of a well known Ponzi scheme involving cryptoassets was the ICO of \"AriseBank\" or \"AriseCoin\", involving claims about founding the world's first \"decentralized bank\". The SEC successfully recovered the funds stolen in the ICO. A similar scheme was perpetrated by the founders of the fraudulent cryptocurrency Bitconnect.\nIn September 2022, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, described cryptocurrencies as \"Decentralised Ponzi Schemes\".\nEconomic bubble.\nEconomic bubbles are also similar to Ponzi schemes in that one participant gets paid by contributions from a subsequent participant until the inevitable collapse. A bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market (for example stock, housing, cryptocurrency, tulip bulbs in the case of the first, or the Mississippi Company) where prices rise because buyers bid more, and buyers bid more because prices are rising. Bubbles are often said to be based on the \"greater fool\" theory. As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme:\nExit scam.\nA Ponzi scheme which ultimately terminates with the operator absconding is similar to an exit scam. The main difference is that an exit scam does not involve any sort of investment vehicle with the accompanying promised returns. Instead, exit scammers either accept payment for product which they never ship (usually after gaining a reputation for reliably shipping of products) or steal funds held in escrow on behalf of third parties (the latter often involves the operators of illegal darknet markets that facilitate the sale of illicit goods and services).\nRelated concepts.\nPonzi finance.\nThe term \"Ponzi finance\" generally designates non-sustainable patterns of finance, such as borrowers who can only meet their debt commitment if they continuously obtain new sources of financing, often at an accelerating pace and/or ever-increasing interest rates until the borrower cannot secure more financing at any interest rate and becomes insolvent. The term was first coined by economist Hyman Minsky.\nPonzi game.\nIn economics, the term \"Ponzi game\" designates a hypothesis where a government continuously defers the repayment of its public debt by issuing new debt: each time its existing debt arrives at maturity, it borrows funds from new and/or existing lenders in order to repay its existing debt.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes, references and sources.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has 12,793 permanent residents, but during the May to September tourist season, the total population may reach up to 20,000. It is also the name of the biggest island in the archipelago, where the main urban area of the is located.\nChristopher Nolan shot his upcoming 2026 film \"The Odyssey\" throughout the Aeolian Islands and particularly around the island of Lipari, cited by its ancient name of \"Aeolia\" after Homer.\nHistory.\nNeolithic period.\nIn Neolithic times Lipari was, much like Sardinia, one of the few centres of trading in obsidian, a hard black volcanic glass prized by Neolithic peoples for the extremely sharp cutting edges that can be obtained. Lipari's history is rich in incidents as witnessed by the recent retrievals of several necropoli and other archaeological sites. Humans seem to have inhabited the island already in 5000 BC, though a local legend gives the eponymous name Liparus to the leader of a people coming from Campania.\nBronze Age.\nEarly Bronze Age.\nIn the early Bronze Age, at the end of the third millennium BC, new settlers of Aeolian origin came from Mycenaean Greece, giving their name to the islands. They had already settled in Metapontum in Italy and used the islands as outposts for controlling trading routes through the strait of Messina.\nMiddle Bronze Age.\nSuccessive domestic buildings have been excavated on the acropolis dating from the 18th c. BC and underlying the ancient Roman town.\nLate Bronze Age.\nIn the 13th century BC, the islands were settled by Ausinian peoples from the coasts of Campania, who introduced the myth of King Liparus from whom the town's name derives.\nIn the Mycenaean Period, Lipari has yielded pottery from LHI to LHIII.\nIron Age.\nLipari's continuous occupation may have been interrupted violently when in the late 9th century BC an Ausonian civilization site was burned and apparently not rebuilt. Many household objects have been retrieved from the charred site.\nGreek and Roman periods.\nGreek colonists from Knidos arrived at Lipara ~580 BC after their first colonization attempt in Sicily failed and their leader, Pentathlos, was killed. They settled on the site of the village now known as Castello in Magna Graecia. The colony successfully fought the Etruscans for control of the Tyrrhenian Sea.\nThe town was initially concentrated upon the summit of the rock which played the role of acropolis, seat of religious cults and of public life, but in the course of the first century of its existence, an increase in the population necessitated an expansion into the area at the foot of the rocky slopes and on to the top of the Civita hill. A first city wall, built sometime in the 5th century BC was erected along outcrops at the bottom of the slopes of the rock, leaving outside the modern district of Diana, which was destined from the beginning to accommodate the city necropolis. A second city wall was built in the 4th century BC to enclose the new residential area bounded to the north and south by the river-beds of Santa Lucia and Ponte, which in ancient times ran into the two bays at the foot of the rock. The city wall ran near the two river-beds and then joined on to the Acropolis and the Civita hill. The mighty fortification, of which some traces are visible today in the district of Diana, divided the town from the necropolis.\nCarthaginian forces succeeded in holding the site briefly during their struggles with Dionysios I, tyrant of Syracuse in 394 BC, but once they were gone the \"polis\" entered a three-way alliance which included Dionysios' new colony at Tyndaris. Lipara prospered, but in 304 BC Agathokles took the town by treachery and is said to have lost all of his pillage from it in a storm at sea.\nLipara became a Carthaginian naval base during the first Punic War, but fell to Roman forces in 252\u2013251 BC. It was occupied by Agrippa in Octavian's campaign against Sextus Pompeius. Under the Roman Empire it was a place of retreat and exile and was enjoyed because of its thermal baths using natural springs. The Emperor Caracalla sent his wife, Fulvia Plautilla, and her brother, Plautius, into exile here for the rest of their lives.\nMany objects recovered from old wrecks are now in the Aeolian Museum of Lipari.\nFrom the Middle Ages to present.\nLipari was probably an episcopal see from the 3rd century onward, with the first bishop being St. Agatone, who, according to tradition, had found the sacred remains in his cathedral. The presence of the relics has been attested since at least 546.\nIn the 9th century, Sicily was conquered by the Arabs, and soon Saracen pirates began to raid across the Tyrrhenian Sea, with dramatic effects for Lipari. In 839 the Saracens slaughtered much of the population, the relics of St. Bartholomew were moved to Benevento, and Lipari was eventually almost totally abandoned. The Normans conquered the Arabs throughout Sicily between 1060 and 1090, and repopulated the island once their rule was secure. The Lipari episcopal seat was reinstated in 1131.\nThough still plagued by pirate raids, the island was continually populated from this time onward. Rule of the island was passed from the Normans to the Hohenstaufen Kings, followed by the Angevins, and then the Aragonese, until Carlos I, the Aragonese King, became the Spanish King, and was then quickly crowned Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.\nFranco-Ottoman attack.\nIn 1544, Ottoman admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa ransacked Lipari and enslaved the entire population. Five French galleys under Captain Polin, including the superb \"R\u00e9ale\", accompanied Barbarossa's fleet on a diplomatic mission to Sultan Suleiman in execution of the Franco-Ottoman alliance. French priest J\u00e9r\u00f4me Maurand lamented about the depredation to his Christian fellow men during the campaign at Lipari: \"To see so many poor Christians, and especially so many little boys and girls [enslaved] caused a very great pity.\" He also mentioned \"the tears, wailings and cries of these poor Lipariotes, the father regarding his son and the mother her daughter... weeping while leaving their own city in order to be brought into slavery by those dogs who seemed like rapacious wolves amidst timid lambs\".\nA number of the citizens were ransomed in Messina and eventually returned to the islands.\nCharles V then had his Spanish subjects repopulate the island and build the massive city walls atop the walls of the ancient Greek acropolis in 1556.\nThe walls created a mighty fortress still standing today. The acropolis, high above the main town, was a safe haven for the populace in the event of a raid. While these walls protected the main town, it was not safe to live on the rest of the island until Mediterranean piracy was largely eradicated, which did not occur until the 19th century.\n20th century.\nFrom the 1920s to the 1940s, the Lipari islands were used for the confinement of political prisoners, including Emilio Lussu, Curzio Malaparte, Carlo Rosselli, Giuseppe Ghetti, and Edda Mussolini. During the 1930s, the islands were used to detain exiled members of the fascist, Croatian nationalist Usta\u0161e movement.\nThe islands were then extensively searched by archeologists Madeleine Cavalier and Luigi Bernab\u00f2 Brea after World War II.\nGeography.\nLipari Island is the largest of a chain of islands in a volcanic archipelago situated in between Vesuvius and Etna. The island has a surface area of 89.72\u00a0km2 and is 30\u00a0km from Sicily. Besides the main town, most of the year-round population resides in one of the four main villages: Pianoconte is almost due west across the island, Quattropani in the northwest, Acquacalda along the northern coast, whereas Canneto is on the eastern shore north of Lipari town. The highest point on the island is Monte Chirica at 602\u00a0m (1975\u00a0ft).\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGeology.\nGeologists agree on the fact that Lipari (island) was created by a succession of four volcanic movements, the most extensive of which was the third one, presumably lasting from 20,000 BC to 13,000 BC. A further vast phenomenon should have happened around 9000 BC. In the 5th century AD when airborne pumice, together with volcanic ash, covered the Roman villages of the island. The volcanoes are considered active, and steaming fumaroles and hydrothermal activity may still be seen. As a result of its volcanic origin, the island is covered with pumice and obsidian. Pumice mining has become a large industry on Lipari, and the pale pumice from Lipari is shipped worldwide. The last eruption occurred in 1220 AD.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47189", "revid": "6556438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47189", "title": "Tindari", "text": "Frazione of Italy\nTindari (; ), ancient Tyndaris (, Strab.) or Tyndarion (, Ptol.), is a small town, \"frazione\" (suburb or municipal component) in the \"comune\" of Patti and a Latin Catholic titular see.\nThe monumental ruins of ancient Tyndaris are a main attraction for visitors and excavations are continuing to reveal more parts of the city.\nTindari has a famous sanctuary and is also famous for the poem \"Vento a Tindari\", written by Salvatore Quasimodo.\nHistory.\nAncient Tyndaris was strategically situated on its prominent hill overlooking the wide bay of the Tyrrhenian Sea bounded by the Capo di Milazzo on the east, and the Capo Calav\u00e0 on the west. It was connected by a comparatively narrow isthmus with the lower ground inland. It thus commanded views of the summit of Mount Etna and northwards to the Lipari Islands.\nIt was one of the latest of all the cities in Sicily that could claim a purely Greek origin, having been founded by the elder Dionysius in 396 or 395 BC in Magna Graecia; the site is so strategic that it is a surprise it was not occupied earlier. The original settlers were the remains of the Messenian exiles, who had been driven from Naupactus, Zacynthus, and the Peloponnese by the Spartans after the close of the Peloponnesian War. These had at first been established by Dionysius at Messana, when he repeopled that city; but the Spartans having taken umbrage at this, he transferred them to the site of Tyndaris, which had previously been included in the territory of Abacaenum. The colonists themselves gave to their new city the name of Tyndaris, from their native divinities, the \"Tyndaridae\" or Dioscuri, and readily admitting fresh citizens from other quarters, soon raised their whole population to the number of 5000 citizens. The new city thus rose at once to be a place of considerable importance.\nIt is next mentioned in 344 BC, when it was one of the first cities that declared in favor of Timoleon after his landing in Sicily. At a later period we find it mentioned as espousing the cause of Hieron, and supporting him during his war against the Mamertines, 269 BC. On that occasion he rested his position upon Tyndaris on the left, and on Tauromenium (modern Taormina) on the right. Indeed, the strong position of Tyndaris made it an important strategic post on the Tyrrhenian sea, as Tauromenium was on the Sicilian sea, and hence we find it frequently mentioned in accounts of subsequent wars. In the First Punic War it was at first dependent upon Carthage; and though the citizens, alarmed at the progress of the Roman armies, were at one time on the point of turning to Rome, they were restrained by the Carthaginians, who carried off all the chief citizens as hostages. In 257 BC, the Battle of Tyndaris took place off the coast of Tyndaris, between the city and the Liparaean islands, in which a Roman fleet under Gaius Atilius Regulus obtained some advantage over the Carthaginian fleet, but without any decisive result. The Roman fleet is described on that occasion as touching at the promontory of Tyndaris, but the city had not yet fallen into their hands, and it was not until after the fall of Panormus (modern Palermo) in 254 BC that Tyndaris expelled the Carthaginian garrison and joined the Roman alliance.\nWe hear little of Tyndaris under Roman government, but it appears to have been a flourishing and considerable city. Cicero calls it \"nobilissima civitas\" and we learn from him that the inhabitants had displayed their zeal and fidelity towards the Romans upon many occasions. Among others they supplied naval forces for the armament of Scipio Africanus the Younger, a service for which he repaid them by restoring to them a statue of Mercury which had been carried off by the Carthaginians and which continued as an object of great veneration in the city, until it was stolen by the rapacious Verres. Tyndaris was also one of seventeen cities selected by the Roman senate, apparently as an honorary distinction, to contribute to certain offerings to the temple of Venus at Eryx. In other respects it had no peculiar privileges, and was in the condition of an ordinary municipal town, with its own magistrates, local senate, etc., but was certainly in the time of Cicero one of the most considerable places in the island. It, however, suffered severely from the exactions of Verres and the inhabitants, to revenge themselves on their oppressor, publicly demolished his statue as soon as he had quit the island.\nTyndaris again bore a considerable part in the Sicilian revolt between Sextus Pompeius and Octavian. It was one of the points occupied and fortified by the former, when preparing for the defence of the Sicilian straits, but was taken by Agrippa after his naval victory at Mylae, and became one of his chief posts, from which he carried on offensive warfare against Pompey. Subsequently, to this we hear nothing more of Tyndaris in history; but there is no doubt of its having continued to subsist throughout the period of the Roman Empire. Strabo speaks of it as one of the places on the north coast of Sicily which, in his time, still deserved the name of cities; and Pliny gives it the title of a \"Colonia\". It is probable that it received a colony under Augustus, as we find it bearing in an inscription the titles of \"Colonia Augusta Tyndaritanorum\". Pliny indeed mentions a great calamity which the city had sustained, when (he tells us) half of it was swallowed up by the sea, probably from an earthquake having caused the fall of part of the hill on which it stands, but we have no clue to the date of this event. The Itineraries attest the existence of Tyndaris, apparently still as a considerable place, in the fourth century.\nEcclesiastical history.\nTitular see.\nThe diocese was nominally restored in 1968 as Latin Titular bishopric of Tindari (Curiate Italian) / Tyndaris (Latin) / Tyndaritan(us) (Latin adjective)\nRemains.\nBy the 19th century, the site of Tyndaris was wholly deserted, but the name was retained by a church, which crowned the most elevated point of the hill on which the city formerly stood, and was still called the Madonna di Tindaro. It is c.\u00a0180\u00a0m above the sea-level, and forms a conspicuous landmark to sailors. Considerable ruins of the ancient city, are also visible. It occupied the whole plateau or summit of the hill, and the remains of the ancient walls may be traced, at intervals, all round the brow of the cliffs, except in one part, facing the sea, where the cliff is now quite precipitous. It is not improbable that it is here that a part of the cliff fell in, in the manner recorded by Pliny Two gates of the city are also still distinctly to be traced.\nThe chief monuments, of which the ruins are still extant within the circuit of the walls, are:\nNumerous inscriptions, fragments of sculpture, and architectural decorations, as well as coins, vases etc. have also been discovered on the site.\nLegend.\nLocal legend tells that the lagoon was created after a pilgrim who came to see the Madonna refused to pray to the Madonna because she was black. The woman accidentally dropped her baby into the ocean and the Madonna made the land rise to save the baby. The sands of Marinello have taken shape of the profile of the Madonna.\nCultural references.\nAn episode of \"Inspector Montalbano\" was called \"Excursion to Tindari\". It ends with four of the main characters overlooking the bay.\nSalvatore Quasimodo, who would later win the Nobel prize for literature, in 1930 published a poem entitled \"Vento a Tindari\" (Wind at Tindari).\nAccessibility.\nBy car, if you come from Falcone, of Autostrada Messina-Palermo take Palermo direction along SS 113.\nBut Tindari and its Church are reachable by trains run by Trenitalia, including services from Messina with the Oliveri railway station situated on the Palermo\u2013Messina railway.

At the 2021 census, Tallangatta had a population of 1,175.\nHistory.\nTallangatta was founded in the 1870s, the Post Office opening on 15 May 1871.\nOn the arrival of the railway it served as a rail gateway for the Mitta and Upper Murray valleys (the Upper Murray only until the railway was extended to Cudgewa). Some gold and tin mining occurred in the late 19th and early 20th century, though, unlike Beechworth, little evidence of this remains. The amount of gold produced was relatively small compared to other mines elsewhere in the region.\nSince that time, Tallangatta has been a service centre for the local farming community, with a butter factory operating throughout much of the 20th century. Improved road transport links finally ended both the dairy and the rail link in the 1970s (with dairy processing operations now concentrated in Tangambalanga, about to the west).\nThe most distinctive aspect of the town's history is that it was moved to the west in the 1950s to a site known as Bolga to allow for the expansion of Lake Hume. Stories of the transition from old town to new town were captured in the 1988 book \"Slates and Suet Puddings\" by Carmyl Winkler. On 14 April 1955 the Post Office was renamed Tallangatta East and a new Tallangatta office opened at the new town location. The sign welcoming motorists to town reads \"Tallangatta, the town that moved in the 1950s\".\nTallangatta sits on the banks of Lake Hume, which is an irrigation storage lake, with lake levels reaching the township when capacity is above 40% (usually winter) and the boat ramp generally usable above 51% capacity. \nThe grid layout of the streets of Old Tallangatta is clearly visible in Google Earth.\nThe Tallangatta Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1990.\nClimate.\nTallangatta possesses a (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa), with very warm, relatively dry summers and cool, slightly wetter winters. Average maxima vary from in January to in July while average minima fluctuate between in January and in July. Mean precipitation is moderate (averaging per annum). Tallangatta receives 111.6 precipitation days annually, with its frequency peaking in winter. The town experiences 111.4 clear days and 145.1 cloudy days per annum. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 31 January 2020 to on 26 July 1986. All climate data was sourced from Hume Dam, situated northwest of Tallangatta.\nPopulation.\nAccording to the 2021 Census the population of Tallangatta is 1,175, of which:\nEconomy.\nBeef and dairy cattle farming is the dominant industry, with a small abattoir. In 2016, Tallangatta was declared a \"Notable Town\", by Heritage Australia. The main street is long for a town of its size and is quite unique. The unique architecture is home to a thriving retail and hospitality sector that contributes to local employment and tourism. Services include a small hospital, and two primary schools, a secondary school and an integrated childcare, library and community centre. A considerable number of residents now commute to work in Albury\u2013Wodonga.\nThe decline of the water frontage of Lake Hume, due to sporadic drought conditions and the privatisation of Australia waterways, has had an impact on the town. Although through initiatives, such as the Tallangatta Tomorrow project funded by state government, the township is experiencing a new lease on life.\nSeveral community-focused initiatives operate within the township including Tallangatta Food Swap, Boomerang Bags Tallangatta, the Tallangatta Community Theatre Group, the Uniting Church Op Shop, and Plasticwise Tallangatta.\nThe town has a high proportion of retirees, with some elderly people cared for at Bolga Court Hostel. This heritage is celebrated in the popular annual Tallangatta Fifties Festival; however, as of June 2018, has ended due to financial concerns and feedback.\nTransport.\nThere is no scheduled public transport in Tallangatta, other than school buses which are not available to the general public. The town is mainly accessed via the Murray Valley Highway; the northern terminus of the Omeo Highway to Omeo is approximately east of the town. \nThe High Country Rail Trail passes through the town; it follows the route of the Cudgewa railway line, which closed in 1981.\nSport.\nTallangatta has an Australian rules football team, the Tallangatta Football Club competing in the Tallangatta &amp; District Football League.\nGolfers play at the Tallangatta Golf Club on Coorilla Street.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

{"id": "47198", "revid": "39150892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47198", "title": "Weimar", "text": "Weimar is a city in the German state of Thuringia, in Central Germany between Erfurt to the west and Jena to the east, southwest of Leipzig, north of Nuremberg and west of Dresden. Together with the neighbouring cities of Erfurt and Jena, it forms the central metropolitan area of Thuringia, with approximately 500,000 inhabitants. The city itself has a population of 65,000. Weimar is well known because of its cultural heritage and importance in German history.\nThe city was a focal point of the German Enlightenment and home of the leading literary figures of Weimar Classicism, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller. In the 19th century, composers such as Franz Liszt made Weimar a music centre. Later, artists and architects including Henry van de Velde, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Lyonel Feininger, and Walter Gropius came to the city and founded the Bauhaus movement, the most important German design school of the interwar period.\nThe political history of 20th-century Weimar was volatile: it was the place where Germany's first democratic constitution was signed after the First World War, giving its name to the Weimar Republic (1918\u201333), which existed between the end of World War I and the rise of the Nazis. It was also one of the cities mythologized by Nazi propaganda.\nUntil 1948, Weimar was the capital of Thuringia. Many places in the city centre have been designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, either as part of the Classical Weimar complex (containing monuments to the classical period of Weimar in 18th and 19th centuries) or the Bauhaus complex (containing buildings associated with the Bauhaus art school). Heritage tourism is one of the leading economic sectors of Weimar.\nNoted institutions in Weimar are the Bauhaus University, the Liszt School of Music, the Duchess Anna Amalia Library, and two leading courts of Thuringia (the Supreme Administrative Court and Constitutional Court). In 1999, Weimar was the European Capital of Culture.\nHistory.\nPrehistoric times.\nArchaeological finds dating back to the Thuringii epoch (3rd to 6th centuries) show that the Weimar part of the Ilm valley was settled early. A tight network of settlements occupied much of the area of today's city.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe oldest records regarding Weimar date to 899. Its name changed over the centuries from \"Wimares\" through \"Wimari\" to \"Wimar\" and finally Weimar; it is derived from Old High German \"w\u012bh-\" (holy) and \"-mari\" (standing water, swamp). The place was the seat of the County of Weimar, first mentioned in 949, which was one of the most powerful jurisdictions in early Middle Ages Thuringia. In 1062 it was united with the County of Orlam\u00fcnde into the new County of Weimar-Orlam\u00fcnde, which existed until the Thuringian Counts' War in 1346. It fell to the Wettins afterwards.\nThe Weimar settlement emerged around the count's wooden castle and two small churches, dedicated to Saint Peter (which later became the main church), and to Saint James, respectively. In 1240, the count founded the dynasty's monastery in Oberweimar, run by Cistercian nuns. Soon after, the counts of Weimar founded the town, which was an independent parish since 1249 and called \"civitas\" in 1254. From 1262, the citizens used their own seal. The regional influence of the Weimar counts was declining as the influence of the Wettins in Thuringia increased. Hence, the new small town was relatively marginal in a regional context, also due to the fact that it was located far from relevant trade routes, such as the Via Regia. The settlement around Saint James Church developed into a suburb during the 13th century.\nAfter becoming part of Wettin territory in 1346, urban development improved. The Wettins fostered Weimar by abolishing socage and granting privileges to the citizens. Now Weimar became equal to other Wettinian cities like Wei\u00dfensee and grew during the 15th century, with the establishment of a town hall and the current main church. In 1438 Weimar acquired trade privileges for woad, a plant from which blue dye was made. The castle and the walls were finished in the 16th century, making Weimar into a full city.\nEarly Modern Period.\nAfter the Treaty of Leipzig (1485) Weimar became part of the electorate of the Ernestine branch of Wettins with Wittenberg as capital. The Protestant Reformation was introduced in Weimar in 1525; Martin Luther stayed several times in the city. As the Ernestines lost the Schmalkaldic War in 1547, their capital Wittenberg went also to the Albertines, so that they needed a new residence. As the ruler returned from captivity, Weimar became his residence in 1552 and remained as such until the end of the monarchy in 1918. The first Ernestine territorial partition in 1572 was followed by various ones, nevertheless Weimar stayed the capital of different Saxe-Weimar states. The court and its staff brought some wealth to the city, so that it saw a first construction boom in the 16th century. The 17th century brought decline to Weimar, because of changing trade conditions (as in nearby Erfurt). Besides, the territorial partitions led to the loss of political importance of the dukes of Saxe-Weimar and their finances shrunk. The city's polity weakened more and more and lost its privileges, leading to the absolutist reign of the dukes in the early 18th century. On the other hand, this time brought another construction boom to Weimar, and the city got its present appearance, marked by various ducal representation buildings. The city walls were demolished in 1757 and during the following decades, Weimar expanded in all directions. The biggest building constructed in this period was the \"Schloss\" as the residence of the dukes (north and east wing: 1789\u20131803, west wing 1832\u20131835, south wing: 1913\u20131914). Between 1708 and 1717 Johann Sebastian Bach worked as the court's organist in Weimar.\nGolden or Classical Age (1758\u20131832).\nThe period from the start of the regencies of Anna Amalia (1758\u20131775) and her son Carl August (1775\u20131828) through to Goethe's death in 1832 is denoted as the \"golden\" or the \"classical\" age because of the high level of cultural activity in Weimar. The city became an important cultural centre of Europe, having been home to literary figures including Goethe, Schiller, Herder, Wieland and Bertuch; and in music the piano virtuoso Hummel. It has been a site of pilgrimage for the German intelligentsia since Goethe first moved to Weimar in 1775. Goethe was also active in civic duties while living there. He served as Privy Councilor to the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach for an extended period. The tombs of Goethe and Schiller, as well as their archives, may be found in the city. Goethe's \"Elective Affinities\" (1809) is set around the city of Weimar. In comparison to many major German states, the dukes' policy was liberal and tolerant in this period. The liberal Saxe-Weimar constitution was brought into effect in 1816.\nSilver Ages and The New Weimar (1832\u20131918).\nThe time after Goethe's death is denoted as the \"silver\" age because Weimar remained an influential cultural centre. The first emphasis was fostering music. In 1842, Franz Liszt moved to Weimar to become the Grand Ducal court conductor. Liszt organized the premiere of Richard Wagner's \"Lohengrin\" (1850) as well as the world premi\u00e8re of Saint Sa\u00ebns' opera Samson et Delilah (1877) in the city. The Weimar School of Music was founded in 1872 as Germany's first orchestra school. Richard Strauss worked in Weimar between 1889 and 1894 as second conductor in the acclaimed Staatskapelle Weimar (the court orchestra founded in 1491). Several of his encores for works such as \"Don Juan\" and \"Macbeth\" were performed by the Staatskapelle Weimar. He also premi\u00e8red Humperdinck's opera H\u00e4nsel and Gretel 1893 in Weimar. Friedrich Nietzsche moved to Weimar in 1897, and died there three years later.\nIn 1860 the Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School, the precursor of today's Bauhaus University, was founded. This was the beginning of academic arts education in Weimar. The institution created its own painting style, the \"Weimar School\" of painting with representatives such as Max Liebermann and Arnold B\u00f6cklin. The Kunstgewerbeschule Weimar was found by Henry van de Velde with the support of Grand Duke William Ernest in 1902 and represents the other root of Bauhaus, known as \"Das Neue Weimar\" (\"The New Weimar\") around Harry Graf Kessler. It was a foundation against Prussia's restrictive arts policy favouring Historicism instead of international Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau.\nAs early as the 19th century, the curation of Weimar and its heritage started. Many archives, societies and museums were founded to present and conserve the cultural sights and goods. In 1846, Weimar was connected by the Thuringian Railway. In the following decades, the city saw a construction and population boom (like most late-19th century cities in Germany). Nevertheless, Weimar did not become industrialised, and remained a city of clerks, artists and rentiers. During the German Revolution of 1918\u201319 the last reigning grand duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, William Ernest, had to abdicate and went in exile to Heinrichau in Silesia.\nWeimar Republic.\nThe period in German history from 1919 to 1933 is commonly referred to as the Weimar Republic, as the Republic's constitution was drafted there rather than Berlin. The capital was considered too dangerous for the National Assembly to use as a meeting place because of street rioting during the Spartacist uprising. Reich President Friedrich Ebert favored Weimar because he hoped it would remind the victorious Allies of Weimar Classicism while they were deliberating the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Since the calm and centrally located Weimar had a suitable place of assembly (the theatre), hotels and infrastructure, it was chosen as the host city.\nIn 1920, the federal state of Thuringia was founded by an association of eight former microstates (Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Saxe-Gotha, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Meiningen, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Reuss-Gera and Reuss-Greiz) and Weimar became its capital. Due to that fact, the city experienced another period of growth.\nIn 1919, Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus School by a merger of the Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School with the Kunstgewerbeschule Weimar. The Bauhaus in Weimar lasted from 1919 to 1925, when it moved to Dessau, after the newly elected right-wing Thuringian council put pressure on the school by withdrawing funding and forcing its teachers to quit. Many buildings in Weimar today have influences from the Bauhaus period. However, only one original Bauhaus building was constructed during 1919\u20131925, the Haus am Horn, now used for exhibitions and events on Bauhaus culture.\nThe Weimar Republic era was marked by a constant conflict between progressive and \"V\u00f6lkisch\" forces, the former represented by Harry Graf Kessler and the latter by Adolf Bartels in Weimar. The \"Weimarer Zeitung\" was published in Weimar as a local newspaper. After 1929, the right-wing forces prevailed and Weimar became an early centre of Nazism.\nNazi Germany and World War II.\nWeimar was important to the Nazis for two reasons: first, it was where the hated Weimar Republic was founded, and second, it had been a centre of German high culture in recent centuries. In 1926, the NSDAP held its party convention in Weimar. Adolf Hitler visited Weimar more than forty times prior to 1933. In 1930, Wilhelm Frick became minister for internal affairs and education in Thuringia \u2013 the first NSDAP minister in Germany. In 1932, the NSDAP came to power in Thuringia under Fritz Sauckel. In 1933, the first Nazi concentration camps were established around Weimar in Nohra (the first one in Germany) and Bad Sulza. Most prisoners at this time were communists and social democrats. After Kristallnacht in 1938, harassment of Jews became more intense, so that many of them emigrated or were arrested. The Weimar Synagogue was destroyed in 1938.\nDuring the 1930s, the barracks in Weimar was greatly extended. One famous person serving as a soldier in Weimar was Wolfgang Borchert, later a well known poet and playwright. As it was the capital of Thuringia, the Nazis built a new Roman-fascist-style administrative centre between the city centre and the main station. This Gauforum, designed by Hermann Giesler, was the only Nazi governmental building completed outside Berlin (though there were plans for all German state capitals). Today it hosts the Thuringian State Administration. Other Giesler buildings are the Villa Sauckel, the governor's palace and the Hotel Elephant in the city centre.\nIn 1937, the Nazis established Buchenwald concentration camp from Weimar city centre. Between July 1938 and April 1945, some 240,000 people were incarcerated in the camp by the Nazi regime, including 168 Western Allied POWs. The number of deaths in Buchenwald is estimated at 56,545. The Buchenwald concentration camp provided slave labour for local industry, including the \"Wilhelm-Gustloff-Werk\" arms factory.\nThe city centre was partially damaged by US Air Force bombing in 1945 with some 1,800 people killed and many historic buildings destroyed. Nevertheless, most of the destroyed buildings were restored soon after the war because of their importance in German cultural history. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Weimar in April 1945, and the city surrendered to the US 80th Infantry Division on 12 April 1945. The residents of Weimar were ordered to walk through Buchenwald, to see what had been happening so close to the city, as documented in Billy Wilder's film \"Death Mills\". The city ended up in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, so US troops were soon replaced by Soviet forces.\nSince 1945.\nFrom 1945 to 1950, the Soviet Union used the occupied Buchenwald concentration camp as a NKVD special camp to imprison defeated Nazis and other Germans. The camp slogan remained . On 6 January 1950, the Soviets handed over Buchenwald to the East German Ministry of Internal Affairs.\nIn 1948, the East German government declared Erfurt as Thuringia's new capital, and Weimar lost its influence on German contemporary culture and politics. (The state of Thuringia itself was dissolved in 1952 and replaced by three Bezirke (districts) in a local government reform; Weimar belonged to the Bezirk of Erfurt.) The city was the headquarters of the Soviet Union's 8th Guards Army as part of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. Due to its fame and importance for tourism, Weimar received more financial subsidies from the GDR government and remained in better condition than most East German cities.\nAfter German reunification in 1990, Weimar experienced significant economic hardship, but funding restored much that had deteriorated. In 1991, the city hosted the first trilateral meeting between the foreign ministers of Germany, France and Poland giving its name to the Weimar Triangle format. It was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996 (Bauhaus) and 1998 (Classical Weimar). The European Council of Ministers selected the city as European Capital of Culture for 1999. Tourism has become an important economic factor over the decades. Weimar is now a popular residence of people working in Erfurt and Jena, both less than 20 minutes away.\nIn 2004, a fire broke out at the Duchess Anna Amalia Library. The library contains a 13,000-volume collection including Goethe's masterpiece \"Faust\", as well as the duchess's music collection. An authentic Luther Bible from 1534 was saved from the fire. The library is one of the oldest in Europe, dating back to 1691, and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Over one million volumes were housed in the library, of which forty to fifty thousand were damaged beyond repair. A number of books were shock-frozen in Leipzig to save them from rotting. The library was reopened in 2007.\nGeography and demographics.\nTopography.\nWeimar is situated within the valley of the Ilm river, a tributary of the Saale river on the southern border of the Thuringian Basin, a fertile agricultural area between the Harz mountains to the north and the Thuringian Forest to the southwest. The municipal terrain is hilly; the height of the city centre in the Ilm valley is approximately 200 m of elevation. To the north, the terrain rises to Ettersberg, the city's backyard mountain, 482 m in height. The range of hills in the south of Weimar rises up to 370 m and is part of the Ilm Saale Plate Muschelkalk formation. The eastern, central and western parts of the municipal territory are in agricultural use, whereas the Ettersberg and some southern areas are wooded.\nClimate.\nWeimar has a humid continental climate (\"Dfb\") or an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\") according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system. Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of and lows of . Winters are relatively cold with average high temperatures of and lows of . The city's topography creates a microclimate caused through the basin position with sometimes inversion in winter (quite cold nights under ). Annual precipitation is only with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Light snowfall occurs, mainly from December through February, but snow cover does not usually remain for long.\nThe Weimar (Erfurt\u2013Weimar Airport) weather station has recorded the following extreme values:\nAdministrative division.\nWeimar abuts the district of Weimarer Land with the municipalities Berlstedt, Ettersburg, Kleinobringen, Gro\u00dfobringen and Wohlsborn in the north, Kromsdorf, Umpferstedt and Mellingen in the east, Vollersroda, Buchfart, Hetschburg, Bad Berka and Troistedt in the south and Nohra, Daasdorf am Berge, Hopfgarten and Ottstedt am Berge in the west.\nThe city itself is divided into 10 inner urban and 11 suburban districts. The centre is formed by the district \"Altstadt\" (old town) and the Gr\u00fcnderzeit districts \"Nordvorstadt\" in the north, \"Parkvorstadt\" in the east and \"Westvorstadt\" in the south and west. Later additions are \"S\u00fcdstadt\" in the south and \"Sch\u00f6nblick\" in the southwest. Finally, there are the Plattenbau settlements, constructed during the GDR period, \"Weststadt\" and \"Nordstadt\" as well as two industrial areas in the north and west.\nThe 11 suburban districts are villages which became incorporated during the 20th century; however, they have mostly stayed rural to date: \nDemographics.\nOver the centuries, Weimar remained a small town of less than 5,000 inhabitants. When it became the capital of Saxe-Weimar in 1572, population growth was stimulated and the population increased from 3,000 in 1650 to 6,000 in 1750. Around the year 1800, Weimar had 7,000 inhabitants. Their number grew constantly over the years to 13,000 in 1850, 28,000 in 1900 and 35,000 at the beginning of World War I. During the interwar period, the new capital of Thuringia saw a population boom, which led to 65,000 inhabitants in 1940. Since that time, the population levels have stagnated. The years 2009 to 2012 brought a moderate growth of approximately 0.35% per year, whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Weimar. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders.\nThe birth surplus was +3 in 2012, this is +0.0 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: \u22124.5; national average: \u22122.4). The net migration rate was +4.5 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6). The most important regions of origin are rural areas of Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony as well as foreign countries like Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria.\nLike other eastern German cities, Weimar has a relatively small foreign population (compared to the German average): circa 4.0% are non-Germans by citizenship, while 7.9% have a migrant background (according to 2011 EU census). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Weimar are Vietnamese people, Russians and Ukrainians. During recent years, the economic situation of the city improved: the unemployment rate declined from 20% in 2005 to 5.1% in 2019. Due to the official atheism in the former GDR, most of the population is non-religious. 21.1% are members of the Evangelical Church in Central Germany and 6.8% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).\nCulture, sights and cityscape.\nWorld Heritage Sites.\nTwo World Heritage Sites converge in Weimar: \nMuseums.\nWeimar has a great variety of museums:\nCityscape.\nThe historic city centre of Weimar is situated between the Ilm river in the east, Grabenstra\u00dfe in the north, Goetheplatz and Theaterplatz in the west and Schillerstra\u00dfe in the south. Its two central squares are the Marktplatz in the south (with the town hall) and the Herderplatz in the north (with the main church). Despite its medieval origin, there are only a few medieval buildings, many being destroyed by frequent fires throughout the city's history. Most buildings in this area date back to the 17th and 18th century. Furthermore, Weimar has two old suburbs: in the north, the \"Jakobsvorstadt\" around St. James' Church (medieval origin) and another one in the south around Frauenplan square. The majority of buildings in these areas are also of 17th- and 18th-century origin. During the late 19th and early 20th century, Weimar grew in all directions. Because of its function as an \"officials' city\", the houses in these areas are more substantial than in many comparable Gr\u00fcnderzeit quarters in Germany. The most uptown areas are those right and left of the \"Park an der Ilm\" in the southeast, whereas the western and northern quarters are more basic and mixed with industrial areas in their outer parts. During the GDR period, two new Plattenbau settlements were developed in the west and the north of the city. After 1990, suburbanization occurred for a short time and the rural districts of Weimar saw significant growth as part of the larger city.\nSights and architectural heritage.\nReligious buildings.\nThe city's main church is the Evangelical St. Peter and Paul on the Herderplatz (known as Die Herderkirche). It was rebuilt in late Gothic style after a fire around 1500. Between 1726 and 1735, the interior underwent a Baroque remodelling by Johann Adolf Richter. Johann Gottfried Herder was the dean of the church between 1766 and 1803. The second old Evangelical church of Weimar is St. James on Rollplatz, rebuilt in 1712 in Baroque style. The Roman Catholic parish church of Weimar is dedicated to the Sacred Heart and was built between 1888 and 1891 in historicist forms imitating Florence Cathedral. Another church is the Russian Orthodox Chapel within the historic cemetery. It was built in 1862 as the funerary chapel of Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna and was one of the first Russian-styled buildings in Germany.\nInteresting churches in the suburban districts are the Lutheran parish church of Gelmeroda, which was the inspiration for many paintings by Lyonel Feininger, and the Lutheran parish church of Oberweimar, which was a former monastery, and is a good example of Gothic architecture in Weimar.\nCastles and palaces.\nDue to its function as a ducal residence, Weimar is rich in early-modern castles and palaces. The biggest one is the \"Stadtschloss\" at Burgplatz in the city centre. Today's four-wing building was started after a great fire in 1774. The tower and the Bastille building at its south-western edge are relics of older castles in this place.\nThe \"F\u00fcrstenhaus\" at Platz der Demokratie was the first parliament building in Weimar, established in the 1770s. Today it is in use by the Weimar School of Music. The \"Green Castle\" next to the F\u00fcrstenhaus was built in the 1560s in Renaissance style and hosts today the Duchess Anna Amalia Library. The \"Yellow Castle\" at Gr\u00fcner Markt was built in 1703 and is the municipal library today. The neighbouring \"Red Castle\" is also part of the library and was built in the 1570s. The \"Wittumspalais\" is a smaller widow mansion near Theaterplatz, established in 1768. Outbildings of the ducal residence are the \"Husarenstall\" (1770), the later residence of Charlotte von Stein at Ackerwand street, the \"Marstall\" (1870s) at Kegelplatz, today used as Thuringian State Archive and the \"Reithaus\" (1710s) within the \"Park an der Ilm\".\nFurthermore, there are some impressive ducal country residences around Weimar. They are marked by their beautiful parks and gardens. Schloss Belvedere, south-east of Weimar was built between 1724 and 1732 in Baroque style with an orangery near to a ducal hunting forest. North-east of Weimar, at Ettersburg lies another ducal hunting lodge next to the Ettersberg mountain and its forest, Schloss Ettersburg. It was established between 1706 and 1711 also in Baroque style. The third summer residence, Schloss Tiefurt, is located in Tiefurt, north-east of Weimar. The small lodge in a wide park in Ilm valley was rebuilt in 1775 in late-Baroque forms.\nEvents.\nThe Onion Market (Weimarer Zwiebelmarkt) is an annual festival held in October in Weimar and it is Thuringia's largest festival. The festival is held over 3\u00a0days and approximately 500 stalls and more than 100 stage performances are put up across the city.\nWeimar first celebrated the Onion Market in 1653. Stalls typically offer onion plaits, themed arts and crafts and numerous onion-based foods, including onion cakes, onion soups and onion breads. The festival also hosts numerous beer gardens, live music, fairground attractions and a Ferris wheel.\nThere are several clubs with live music once or twice a week. There is also a student club in the city centre which also features disco and live music events on Friday- and Saturday nights (Kasseturm). There are several smaller theatre and cabaret venues other than the large \"DNT\" (Deutsches National Theater). There are four cinemas including a 3-D cinema, and a Bowling Alley in the Weimar Atrium, the local mall.\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nAgriculture, industry and services.\nThe area around Weimar is relatively fertile and 48% of the municipal surface are used for agricultural production. Most common agricultures are cereals, maize and rapeseed, while famous agricultural products from the Weimar region are potatoes (especially from Heichelheim, to the north) for dishes with s (Kn\u00f6del from potatoes), onions (from Heldrungen and Oldisleben, to the north), which are sold at Weimar Onion Market in October, and Saale-Unstrut wine from Bad Sulza, to the north-east.\nIndustry has never been dominant in Weimar, nevertheless there were several big factories from different sectors until 1990. After reunification, nearly all factories got closed, either because they failed the adoption of free market economy or because the German government sold them to west German businessmen who closed them to avoid competition to their own enterprises. On the other hand, the federal government started early in the 1990s to subsidize the foundation of new companies, but it took long time before the economic situation got stabilized around 2006. Since this time, unemployment decreased and overall, new jobs develop. Today, there are many small and medium-sized companies in Weimar with electro-technics and engineering in focus. Nevertheless, settlement of new factories isn't much in focus of the local government, because it concentrates itself on developing tourism and services. The biggest companies with production in Weimar are Bayer (pharmaceutical factory), Coca-Cola (beverages) and Hydrema (dump truck factory). A new big commercial zone was established in the 1990s in the neighbouring municipality of Nohra with focus on logistics and distribution.\nDue to its tradition as a capital, Weimar is a centre of governmental services to date. Furthermore, creative branches like media, advertising, architecture and design are important for Weimar's economy. The most important sector is tourism with 3,500 hotel beds, 350,000 visitors and 650,000 overnight stays in hotels in 2012 and a large number of German one-day visitors. Other services like retail, trade fairs and specialized hospitals are more brought by the near neighbour cities Erfurt and Jena with their infrastructure.\nTransport.\nBy rail.\nWeimar is connected by the Thuringian Railway to Leipzig in the east and to Frankfurt/Kassel in the west. Furthermore, there are some regional railways to Gera via Jena and to Kranichfeld via Bad Berka. Today, there are long-distance trains to Frankfurt via Erfurt and Fulda and to Dresden via Leipzig and regional trains to G\u00f6ttingen and Eisenach via Erfurt, to Halle via Naumburg, to Altenburg, Glauchau, Zwickau and Greiz via Jena and Gera and to Kranichfeld. After the new Erfurt\u2013Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway was opened in 2015, Weimar was disconnected from the German long-distance train network. However the regional train service are augmented to connect Weimar with ICE-stops in Erfurt, Halle and Leipzig.\nIn freight transport exists an intermodal terminal in Vieselbach \"(G\u00fcterverkehrszentrum/GVZ)\" with connection to rail and Autobahn, west of Weimar.\nBy road.\nWeimar is located at the Bundesautobahn 4 (Frankfurt\u2013Dresden). Furthermore, there are two federal roads to Erfurt and Jena (Bundesstra\u00dfe 7) and to Rudolstadt and K\u00f6lleda (Bundesstra\u00dfe 85) as well as some regional roads to S\u00f6mmerda, O\u00dfmannstedt and Magdala. A bypass road around Weimar was built in the 2000s in the north and west; the eastern and southern continuation are in discussion, but not in definite planning because of some difficulties in routing.\nBy aviation.\nThe Erfurt-Weimar Airport lies approximately west of Weimar. It was largely extended in the 1990s, but the anticipated rise in passengers did not occur so that there is only rare air traffic, mostly to Mediterranean holiday regions. Other flights are carried out via Frankfurt Airport, which can be reached in 3 hours, and via Berlin Brandenburg Airport, which is also about 3 hours away.\nBy bike.\nBiking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. For tourism, there are the \"Ilm track\" and the \"Thuringian city string track (Radweg Th\u00fcringer St\u00e4dtekette)\". Both connect points of tourist interest, the first along the Ilm valley from the Thuringian Forest to the Saale river and the second close to medieval Via Regia from Eisenach via Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, and Jena to Altenburg. Additionally, there are themed routes like the Goethe cycle track and the Feininger cycle track. For inner city everyday traffic, some cycle lanes exist along several main streets. Bike rental is offered in the city centre.\nBus service.\nFor a small city, Weimar is well served by city bus routes, which also serve all of the surrounding towns and villages. An hourly bus route serves the Buchenwald Memorial and oldtimer buses operate in the city's historical centre. All bus routes are connected at Goethe Square in the city centre, and many also serve the main railway station. Trams served the city from 1899 to 1937. Trolleybus service started in 1948 and was discontinued in 1993.\nEducation.\nAfter the reunification, the educational system was realigned. Some academies were combined into the new Bauhaus University, founded in 1996 with approximately 4,200 students and focus on architecture, design and media. The Liszt School of Music is a university focussed on music and music education founded in 1872 with 850 students today. Furthermore, there are three regular Gymnasiums, the \"Musikgymnasium Schloss Belvedere\", an elite boarding school with focus on music, and the Thuringia International School with an international (and foreign language) curriculum.\nThe most important archives in Weimar are the \"Goethe- und Schiller-Archiv\" (member of UNESCO Memory of the World Programme) with focus on German literary history and the Thuringia Main State Archive with governmental documents from last 500 years. The Duchess Anna Amalia Library hosts books and documents of German literary and cultural history.\nPolitics.\nMayor and city council.\nThe most recent mayoral election was held on 26 May 2024, and the results were as follows:\nThe most recent city council election was held on 26 May 2024, and the results were as follows:\nLord Mayor.\nList of mayors and lord mayors (since 1793)\nThe years behind the names indicate the years of office, whereby the year of office did not correspond to the calendar year.\nSince 1838, the city has had a lord mayor.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nWeimar is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFriendly cities.\nWeimar also has friendly relations with:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47200", "revid": "50014652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47200", "title": "4 Vesta", "text": "Second-largest asteroid of the main asteroid belt\nVesta (minor-planet designation: 4 Vesta) is one of the largest objects in the asteroid belt, with a mean diameter of . It was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers on 29 March 1807 and is named after Vesta, the virgin goddess of home and hearth from Roman mythology.\nVesta is thought to be the second-largest asteroid, both by mass and by volume, after the dwarf planet Ceres. Measurements give it a nominal volume only slightly larger than that of Pallas (about 5% greater), but it is 25% to 30% more massive. It constitutes an estimated 9% of the mass of the asteroid belt. Vesta is the only known remaining rocky protoplanet of the kind that formed the terrestrial planets. Numerous fragments of Vesta were ejected by collisions one and two billion years ago that left two enormous craters occupying much of Vesta's southern hemisphere. Debris from these events has fallen to Earth as howardite\u2013eucrite\u2013diogenite (HED) meteorites, which have been a rich source of information about Vesta.\nVesta is the brightest asteroid visible from Earth. It is regularly as bright as magnitude 5.1, at which times it is faintly visible to the naked eye. Its maximum distance from the Sun is slightly greater than the minimum distance of Ceres from the Sun, although its orbit lies entirely within that of Ceres.\nNASA's \"Dawn\" spacecraft entered orbit around Vesta on 16 July 2011 for a one-year exploration and left the orbit of Vesta on 5 September 2012 en route to its final destination, Ceres. Researchers continue to examine data collected by \"Dawn\" for additional insights into the formation and history of Vesta.\nHistory.\nDiscovery.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHeinrich Olbers discovered Pallas in 1802, the year after the discovery of Ceres. He proposed that the two objects were the remnants of a destroyed planet. He sent a letter with his proposal to the British astronomer William Herschel, suggesting that a search near the locations where the orbits of Ceres and Pallas intersected might reveal more fragments. These orbital intersections were located in the constellations of Cetus and Virgo. Olbers commenced his search in 1802, and on 29 March 1807 he discovered Vesta in the constellation Virgo\u2014a coincidence, because Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta are not fragments of a larger body. Because the asteroid Juno had been discovered in 1804, this made Vesta the fourth object to be identified in the region that is now known as the asteroid belt. The discovery was announced in a letter addressed to German astronomer Johann H. Schr\u00f6ter dated 31 March. Because Olbers already had credit for discovering a planet (Pallas; at the time, the asteroids were considered to be planets), he gave the honor of naming his new discovery to German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, whose orbital calculations had enabled astronomers to confirm the existence of Ceres, the first asteroid, and who had computed the orbit of the new planet in the remarkably short time of 10 hours. Gauss decided on the Roman virgin goddess of home and hearth, Vesta.\nName and symbol.\nVesta was the fourth asteroid to be discovered, hence the number\u00a04 in its formal designation. The name \"Vesta\", or national variants thereof, is in international use with two exceptions: Greece and China. In Greek, the name adopted was the Hellenic equivalent of Vesta, Hestia (); in English, that name is used for 46 Hestia (Greeks use the name \"Hestia\" for both, with the minor-planet numbers used for disambiguation). In Chinese, Vesta is called the 'hearth-god(dess) star', \"\", naming the asteroid for Vesta's role in mythology, similar to the Chinese names of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.\nUpon its discovery, Vesta was, like Ceres, Pallas, and Juno before it, classified as a planet and given a planetary symbol. The symbol represented the altar of Vesta with its sacred fire and was designed by Gauss. In Gauss's conception, now obsolete, this was drawn . His form was encoded in Unicode 17.0 as U+1F777 \ud83d\udf77.\nThe asteroid symbols were gradually retired from astronomical use after 1852, but the symbols for the first four asteroids were resurrected for astrology in the 1970s. The abbreviated modern astrological variant of the Vesta symbol is .\nAfter the discovery of Vesta, no further objects were discovered for 38\u00a0years, and during this time the Solar System was thought to have eleven planets. However, in 1845, new asteroids started being discovered at a rapid pace, and by 1851 there were fifteen, each with its own symbol, in addition to the eight major planets (Neptune had been discovered in 1846). It soon became clear that it would be impractical to continue inventing new planetary symbols indefinitely, and some of the existing ones proved difficult to draw quickly. That year, the problem was addressed by Benjamin Apthorp Gould, who suggested numbering asteroids in their order of discovery, and placing this number in a disk (circle) as the generic symbol of an asteroid. Thus, the fourth asteroid, Vesta, acquired the generic symbol \u2463. This was soon coupled with the name into an official number\u2013name designation, \"\u2463 Vesta\", as the number of minor planets increased. By 1858, the circle had been simplified to parentheses, \"(4) Vesta\", which were easier to typeset. Other punctuation, such as \"4) Vesta\" and \"4, Vesta\", was also briefly used, but had more or less completely died out by 1949.\nEarly measurements.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPhotometric observations of Vesta were made at the Harvard College Observatory in 1880\u20131882 and at the Observatoire de Toulouse in 1909. These and other observations allowed the rotation rate of Vesta to be determined by the 1950s. However, the early estimates of the rotation rate came into question because the light curve included variations in both shape and albedo.\nEarly estimates of the diameter of Vesta ranged from in 1825, to . E.C. Pickering produced an estimated diameter of in 1879, which is close to the modern value for the mean diameter, but the subsequent estimates ranged from a low of up to a high of during the next century. The measured estimates were based on photometry. In 1989, speckle interferometry was used to measure a dimension that varied between during the rotational period. In 1991, an occultation of the star SAO 93228 by Vesta was observed from multiple locations in the eastern United States and Canada. Based on observations from 14 different sites, the best fit to the data was an elliptical profile with dimensions of about . \"Dawn\" confirmed this measurement. These measurements will help determine the thermal history, size of the core, role of water in asteroid evolution and what meteorites found on Earth come from these bodies, with the ultimate goal of understanding the conditions and processes present at the solar system's earliest epoch and the role of water content and size in planetary evolution.\nVesta became the first asteroid to have its mass determined. Every 18 years, the asteroid 197 Arete approaches within of Vesta. In 1966, based upon observations of Vesta's gravitational perturbations of Arete, Hans G. Hertz estimated the mass of Vesta at (solar masses). More refined estimates followed, and in 2001 the perturbations of 17 Thetis were used to calculate the mass of Vesta to be . \"Dawn\" determined it to be .\nOrbit.\nVesta orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, within the asteroid belt, with a period of 3.6 Earth years, specifically in the inner asteroid belt, interior to the Kirkwood gap at 2.50\u00a0AU. Its orbit is moderately inclined (\"i\" = 7.1\u00b0, compared to 7\u00b0 for Mercury and 17\u00b0 for Pluto) and moderately eccentric (\"e\" = 0.09, about the same as for Mars).\nTrue orbital resonances between asteroids are considered unlikely. Because of their small masses relative to their large separations, such relationships should be very rare. Nevertheless, Vesta is able to capture other asteroids into temporary 1:1 resonant orbital relationships (for periods up to 2 million years or more) and about forty such objects have been identified. Decameter-sized objects detected in the vicinity of Vesta by \"Dawn\" may be such quasi-satellites rather than proper satellites.\nRotation.\nVesta's rotation is relatively fast for an asteroid (5.342\u00a0h) and prograde, with the north pole pointing in the direction of right ascension 20\u00a0h\u00a032\u00a0min, declination +48\u00b0 (in the constellation Cygnus) with an uncertainty of about 10\u00b0. This gives an axial tilt of 29\u00b0.\nCoordinate systems.\nTwo longitudinal coordinate systems are used for Vesta, with prime meridians separated by 150\u00b0. The IAU established a coordinate system in 1997 based on \"Hubble\" photos, with the prime meridian running through the center of Olbers Regio, a dark feature across. When \"Dawn\" arrived at Vesta, mission scientists found that the location of the pole assumed by the IAU was off by 10\u00b0, so that the IAU coordinate system drifted across the surface of Vesta at 0.06\u00b0 per year, and also that Olbers Regio was not discernible from up close, and so was not adequate to define the prime meridian with the precision they needed. They corrected the pole, but also established a new prime meridian 4\u00b0 from the center of Claudia, a sharply defined crater across, which they say results in a more logical set of mapping quadrangles. All NASA publications, including images and maps of Vesta, use the Claudian meridian, which is unacceptable to the IAU. The IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements recommended a coordinate system, correcting the pole but rotating the Claudian longitude by 150\u00b0 to coincide with Olbers Regio. It was accepted by the IAU, although it disrupts the maps prepared by the \"Dawn\" team, which had been positioned so they would not bisect any major surface features.\nPhysical characteristics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nVesta is the second most massive body in the asteroid belt, although it is only 28% as massive as Ceres, the most massive body. Vesta is, however, the most massive body that formed in the asteroid belt, as Ceres is believed to have formed between Jupiter and Saturn. Vesta's density is lower than those of the four terrestrial planets but is higher than those of most asteroids, as well as all of the moons in the Solar System except Io. Vesta's surface area is about the same as the land area of Pakistan, Venezuela, Tanzania, or Nigeria; slightly under . It has an only partially differentiated interior. Vesta is only slightly larger () than 2 Pallas () in mean diameter, but is about 25% more massive.\nVesta's shape is close to a gravitationally relaxed oblate spheroid, but the large concavity and protrusion at the southern pole (see 'Surface features' below) combined with a mass less than precluded Vesta from automatically being considered a dwarf planet under International Astronomical Union (IAU) Resolution XXVI 5. A 2012 analysis of Vesta's shape and gravity field using data gathered by the \"Dawn\" spacecraft has shown that Vesta is currently not in hydrostatic equilibrium.\nTemperatures on the surface have been estimated to lie between about with the Sun overhead, dropping to about at the winter pole. Typical daytime and nighttime temperatures are and , respectively. This estimate is for 6 May 1996, very close to perihelion, although details vary somewhat with the seasons.\nSurface features.\nBefore the arrival of the \"Dawn\" spacecraft, some Vestan surface features had already been resolved using the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes (e.g., the Keck Observatory). The arrival of \"Dawn\" in July 2011 revealed the complex surface of Vesta in detail.\nRheasilvia and Veneneia.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe most prominent of these surface features are two enormous impact basins, the Rheasilvia, centered near the south pole; and the Veneneia. The Rheasilvia impact basin is younger and overlies the Veneneia. The \"Dawn\" science team named the younger, more prominent crater Rheasilvia, after the mother of Romulus and Remus and a mythical vestal virgin. Its width is 95% of the mean diameter of Vesta. The crater is about deep. A central peak rises above the lowest measured part of the crater floor and the highest measured part of the crater rim is above the crater floor low point. It is estimated that the impact responsible excavated about 1% of the volume of Vesta, and it is likely that the Vesta family and V-type asteroids are the products of this collision. If this is the case, then the fact that fragments have survived bombardment until the present indicates that the crater is at most only about 1\u00a0billion years old. It would also be the site of origin of the HED meteorites. All the known V-type asteroids taken together account for only about 6% of the ejected volume, with the rest presumably either in small fragments, ejected by approaching the 3:1\u00a0Kirkwood gap, or perturbed away by the Yarkovsky effect or radiation pressure. Spectroscopic analyses of the Hubble images have shown that this crater has penetrated deep through several distinct layers of the crust, and possibly into the mantle, as indicated by spectral signatures of olivine.\nSubsequent analysis of data from the Dawn mission provided much greater detail on Rheasilvia's structure and composition, confirming it as one of the largest impact structures known relative to its parent body size. The impact clearly modified the pre-existing very large, Veneneia structure, indicating Rheasilvia's younger age. Rheasilvia's size makes Vesta's southern topography unique, creating a flattened southern hemisphere and contributing significantly to the asteroid's overall oblate shape. Rheasilvia's ~ central peak stands as one of the tallest mountains identified in the Solar System. Its base width of roughly and complex morphology distinguishes it from the simpler central peaks seen in smaller craters. Numerical modeling indicates that such a large central structure within a ~ diameter basin requires formation on a differentiated body with significant gravity. Scaling laws for craters on smaller asteroids fail to predict such a feature; instead, impact dynamics involving transient crater collapse and rebound of the underlying material (potentially upper mantle) are needed to explain its formation. Hydrocode simulations suggest the impactor responsible was likely across, impacting at roughly . Models of impact angle (around 30-45 degrees from vertical) better match the detailed morphology of the basin and its prominent peak. Crater density measurements on Rheasilvia's relatively unmodified floor materials and surrounding ejecta deposits, calibrated using standard lunar chronology functions adapted for Vesta's location, place the impact event at approximately 1 billion years ago. This age makes Rheasilvia a relatively young feature on a protoplanetary body formed early in Solar System history. The estimated excavation of ~1% of Vesta's volume provides a direct link to the Vesta family of asteroids (Vestoids) and the HED meteorites. Since Vesta's spectral signature matches that of the Vestoids and HEDs, this strongly indicates they are fragments ejected from Vesta most likely during the Rheasilvia impact.\nThe Dawn mission's VIR instrument helped to confirm the basin's deep excavation and compositional diversity. VIR mapping revealed spectral variations across the basin consistent with the mixing of different crustal layers expected in the HED meteorites. Signatures matching eucrites (shallow crustal basalts) and diogenites (deeper crustal orthopyroxenites) were identified, which usually correlate with specific morphological features like crater walls or slump blocks. The confirmed signature of olivine-rich material, which were first hinted at by Hubble observations is strongest on the flanks of the central peak and in specific patches along the basin rim and walls, suggesting it is not uniformly distributed but rather exposed in distinct outcrops. As the dominant mineral expected in Vesta's mantle beneath the HED-like crust, the presence of olivine indicates the Rheasilvia impact penetrated Vesta's entire crust (~ thick in the region) and excavated material from the upper mantle. Furthermore, the global stresses resulting from this massive impact are considered the likely trigger for the formation of the large trough systems, like Divalia Fossa, that encircle Vesta's equatorial regions.\nOther craters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSeveral old, degraded craters approach Rheasilvia and Veneneia in size, although none are quite so large. They include Feralia Planitia, shown at right, which is across. More-recent, sharper craters range up to Varronilla and Postumia.\nDust fills up some craters, creating so-called dust ponds. They are a phenomenon where pockets of dust are seen in celestial bodies without a significant atmosphere. These are smooth deposits of dust accumulated in depressions on the surface of the body (like craters), contrasting from the Rocky terrain around them. On the surface of Vesta, we have identified both type\u00a01 (formed from impact melt) and type\u00a02 (electrostatically made) dust ponds within 0\u02da\u201330\u00b0N/S, that is, Equatorial region. 10\u00a0craters have been identified with such formations.\n\"Snowman craters\".\nThe \"snowman craters\" are a group of three adjacent craters in Vesta's northern hemisphere. Their official names, from largest to smallest (west to east), are Marcia, Calpurnia, and Minucia. Marcia is the youngest and cross-cuts Calpurnia. Minucia is the oldest.\nTroughs.\nThe majority of the equatorial region of Vesta is sculpted by a series of parallel troughs designated Divalia Fossae; its longest trough is wide and long. Despite the fact that Vesta is a one-seventh the size of the Moon, Divalia Fossae dwarfs the Grand Canyon. A second series, inclined to the equator, is found further north. This northern trough system is named Saturnalia Fossae, with its largest trough being roughly wide and over long. These troughs are thought to be large-scale graben resulting from the impacts that created Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters, respectively. They are some of the longest chasms in the Solar System, nearly as long as Ithaca Chasma on Tethys. The troughs may be graben that formed after another asteroid collided with Vesta, a process that can happen only in a body that is differentiated, which Vesta may not fully be. Alternatively, it is proposed that the troughs may be radial sculptures created by secondary cratering from Rheasilvia.\nSurface composition.\nCompositional information from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate that the majority of the surface composition of Vesta is consistent with the composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites. The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material. However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia. The origin of this olivine is currently unclear. Though olivine was expected by astronomers to have originated from Vesta's mantle prior to the arrival of the \"Dawn\" orbiter, the lack of olivine within the Rheasilvia and Veneneia impact basins complicates this view. Both impact basins excavated Vestian material down to 60\u2013100\u00a0km, far deeper than the expected thickness of ~30\u201340\u00a0km for Vesta's crust. Vesta's crust may be far thicker than expected or the violent impact events that created Rheasilvia and Veneneia may have mixed material enough to obscure olivine from observations. Alternatively, \"Dawn\" observations of olivine could instead be due to delivery by olivine-rich impactors, unrelated to Vesta's internal structure.\nFeatures associated with volatiles.\nPitted terrain has been observed in four craters on Vesta: Marcia, Cornelia, Numisia and Licinia. The formation of the pitted terrain is proposed to be degassing of impact-heated volatile-bearing material. Along with the pitted terrain, curvilinear gullies are found in Marcia and Cornelia craters. The curvilinear gullies end in lobate deposits, which are sometimes covered by pitted terrain, and are proposed to form by the transient flow of liquid water after buried deposits of ice were melted by the heat of the impacts. Hydrated materials have also been detected, many of which are associated with areas of dark material. Consequently, dark material is thought to be largely composed of carbonaceous chondrite, which was deposited on the surface by impacts. Carbonaceous chondrites are comparatively rich in mineralogically bound OH.\nGeology.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nA large collection of potential samples from Vesta is accessible to scientists, in the form of over 1200\u00a0HED meteorites (Vestan achondrites), giving insight into Vesta's geologic history and structure. NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (NASA IRTF) studies of asteroid suggest that it originated from deeper within Vesta than the HED meteorites.\nVesta is thought to consist of a metallic iron\u2013nickel core, variously estimated to be to in diameter, an overlying rocky olivine mantle, with a surface crust of similar composition to HED meteorites.\nFrom the first appearance of calcium\u2013aluminium-rich inclusions (the first solid matter in the Solar System, forming about 4.567\u00a0billion years ago), a likely time line is as follows:\nVesta is the only known intact asteroid that has been resurfaced in this manner. Because of this, some scientists refer to Vesta as a protoplanet.\nOn the basis of the sizes of V-type asteroids (thought to be pieces of Vesta's crust ejected during large impacts), and the depth of Rheasilvia crater (see below), the crust is thought to be roughly thick.\nFindings from the \"Dawn\" spacecraft have found evidence that the troughs that wrap around Vesta could be graben formed by impact-induced faulting (see Troughs section above), meaning that Vesta has more complex geology than other asteroids. The impacts that created the Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters occurred when Vesta was no longer warm and plastic enough to return to an equilibrium shape, distorting its once rounded shape and prohibiting it from being classified as a dwarf planet today.\nRegolith.\nVesta's surface is covered by regolith distinct from that found on the Moon or asteroids such as Itokawa. This is because space weathering acts differently. Vesta's surface shows no significant trace of nanophase iron because the impact speeds on Vesta are too low to make rock melting and vaporization an appreciable process. Instead, regolith evolution is dominated by brecciation and subsequent mixing of bright and dark components. The dark component is probably due to the infall of carbonaceous material, whereas the bright component is the original Vesta basaltic soil.\nFragments.\nSome small Solar System bodies are suspected to be fragments of Vesta caused by impacts. The Vestian asteroids and HED meteorites are examples. The V-type asteroid 1929 Kollaa has been determined to have a composition akin to cumulate eucrite meteorites, indicating its origin deep within Vesta's crust.\nVesta is currently one of only eight identified Solar System bodies of which we have physical samples, coming from a number of meteorites suspected to be Vestan fragments. It is estimated that 1 out of 16 meteorites originated from Vesta. The other identified Solar System samples are from Earth itself, meteorites from Mars, meteorites from the Moon, and samples returned from the Moon, the comet Wild 2, and the asteroids 25143 Itokawa, 162173 Ryugu, and 101955 Bennu.\nExploration.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 1981, a proposal for an asteroid mission was submitted to the European Space Agency (ESA). Named the Asteroidal Gravity Optical and Radar Analysis (AGORA), this spacecraft was to launch some time in 1990\u20131994 and perform two flybys of large asteroids. The preferred target for this mission was Vesta. AGORA would reach the asteroid belt either by a gravitational slingshot trajectory past Mars or by means of a small ion engine. However, the proposal was refused by the ESA. A joint NASA\u2013ESA asteroid mission was then drawn up for a Multiple Asteroid Orbiter with Solar Electric Propulsion (MAOSEP), with one of the mission profiles including an orbit of Vesta. NASA indicated they were not interested in an asteroid mission. Instead, the ESA set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive. Other missions to the asteroid belt were proposed in the 1980s by France, Germany, Italy and the United States, but none were approved. Exploration of Vesta by fly-by and impacting penetrator was the second main target of the first plan of the multi-aimed Soviet Vesta mission, developed in cooperation with European countries for realisation in 1991\u20131994 but canceled due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\nIn the early 1990s, NASA initiated the Discovery Program, which was intended to be a series of low-cost scientific missions. In 1996, the program's study team recommended a mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine as a high priority. Funding for this program remained problematic for several years, but by 2004 the \"Dawn\" vehicle had passed its critical design review and construction proceeded.\nIt launched on 27 September 2007 as the first space mission to Vesta. On 3 May 2011, \"Dawn\" acquired its first targeting image from Vesta. On 16 July 2011, NASA confirmed that it received telemetry from \"Dawn\" indicating that the spacecraft successfully entered Vesta's orbit. It was scheduled to orbit Vesta for one year, until July 2012. \"Dawn\"'s arrival coincided with late summer in the southern hemisphere of Vesta, with the large crater at Vesta's south pole (Rheasilvia) in sunlight. Because a season on Vesta lasts eleven months, the northern hemisphere, including anticipated compression fractures opposite the crater, would become visible to \"Dawn\"'s cameras before it left orbit. \"Dawn\" left orbit around Vesta on 4 September 2012 11:26 p.m. PDT to travel to Ceres.\nNASA/DLR released imagery and summary information from a survey orbit, two high-altitude orbits (60\u201370\u00a0m/pixel) and a low-altitude mapping orbit (20\u00a0m/pixel), including digital terrain models, videos and atlases. Scientists also used \"Dawn\" to calculate Vesta's precise mass and gravity field. The subsequent determination of the J2 component yielded a core diameter estimate of about assuming a crustal density similar to that of the HED.\n\"Dawn\" data can be accessed by the public at the UCLA website.\nObservations from \"Dawn\".\nVesta comes into view as the \"Dawn\" spacecraft approaches and enters orbit:\nTrue-color images.\nDetailed images retrieved during the high-altitude (60\u201370\u00a0m/pixel) and low-altitude (~20\u00a0m/pixel) mapping orbits are available on the Dawn Mission website of JPL/NASA.\nVisibility.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIts size and unusually bright surface make Vesta the brightest asteroid, and it is occasionally visible to the naked eye from dark skies (without light pollution). In May and June 2007, Vesta reached a peak magnitude of +5.4, the brightest since 1989. At that time, opposition and perihelion were only a few weeks apart. It was brighter still at its 22 June 2018 opposition, reaching a magnitude of +5.3.\nLess favorable oppositions during late autumn 2008 in the Northern Hemisphere still had Vesta at a magnitude of from +6.5 to +7.3. Even when in conjunction with the Sun, Vesta will have a magnitude around +8.5; thus from a pollution-free sky it can be observed with binoculars even at elongations much smaller than near opposition.\n2010\u20132011.\nIn 2010, Vesta reached opposition in the constellation of Leo on the night of 17\u201318 February, at about magnitude 6.1, a brightness that makes it visible in binocular range but generally not for the naked eye. Under perfect dark sky conditions where all light pollution is absent it might be visible to an experienced observer without the use of a telescope or binoculars. Vesta came to opposition again on 5 August 2011, in the constellation of Capricornus at about magnitude 5.6.\n2012\u20132013.\nVesta was at opposition again on 9 December 2012. According to \"Sky and Telescope\" magazine, this year Vesta came within about 6 degrees of 1 Ceres during the winter of 2012 and spring 2013. Vesta orbits the Sun in 3.63 years and Ceres in 4.6 years, so every 17.4 years Vesta overtakes Ceres (the previous overtaking was in April 1996). On 1 December 2012, Vesta had a magnitude of 6.6, but it had decreased to 8.4 by 1 May 2013.\n2014.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCeres and Vesta came within one degree of each other in the night sky in July 2014.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was first performed as a two-act \"op\u00e9ra bouffon\" at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Bouffes-Parisiens, Paris, on 21 October 1858, and was extensively revised and expanded in a four-act \"op\u00e9ra f\u00e9erie\" version, presented at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9, Paris, on 7 February 1874.\nThe opera is a lampoon of the ancient legend of Orpheus and Eurydice. In this version Orpheus is not the son of Apollo but a rustic violin teacher. He is glad to be rid of his wife, Eurydice, when she is abducted by the god of the underworld, Pluto. Orpheus has to be bullied by Public Opinion into trying to rescue Eurydice. The reprehensible conduct of the gods of Olympus in the opera was widely seen as a veiled satire of the court and government of Napoleon III, Emperor of the French. Some critics expressed outrage at the librettists' disrespect for classic mythology and the composer's parody of Gluck's opera ; others praised the piece highly.\n was Offenbach's first full-length opera. The original 1858 production became a box-office success, and ran well into the following year, rescuing Offenbach and his Bouffes company from financial difficulty. The 1874 revival broke records at the Ga\u00eet\u00e9's box-office. The work was frequently staged in France and internationally during the composer's lifetime and throughout the 20th century. It is one of his most often performed operas, and continues to be revived in the 21st century.\nIn the last decade of the 19th century the Paris cabarets the Moulin Rouge and Folies Berg\u00e8re adopted the music of the \"Galop infernal\" from the culminating scene of the opera to accompany the can-can, and ever since then the tune has been popularly associated with the dance.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBackground and first productions.\nBetween 1855 and 1858 Offenbach presented more than two dozen one-act operettas, first at the Bouffes-Parisiens, Salle Lacaze, and then at the Bouffes-Parisiens, Salle Choiseul. The theatrical licensing laws then permitted him only four singers in any piece, and with such small casts, full-length works were out of the question. In 1858 the licensing restrictions were relaxed, and Offenbach was free to go ahead with a two-act work that had been in his mind for some time. Two years earlier he had told his friend the writer Hector Cr\u00e9mieux that when he was musical director of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise in the early 1850s he swore revenge for the boredom he suffered from the posturings of mythical heroes and gods of Olympus in the plays presented there. Cremieux and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy sketched out a libretto for him lampooning such characters. By 1858, when Offenbach was finally allowed a large enough cast to do the theme justice, Hal\u00e9vy was preoccupied with his work as a senior civil servant, and the final libretto was credited to Cr\u00e9mieux alone. Most of the roles were written with popular members of the Bouffes company in mind, including D\u00e9sir\u00e9, L\u00e9once, Lise Tautin, and Henri Tayau as an Orph\u00e9e who could actually play Orpheus's violin.\nThe first performance took place at the Salle Choiseul on 21 October 1858. At first the piece did reasonably well at the box-office but was not the tremendous success Offenbach had hoped for. He insisted on lavish stagings for his operas: expenses were apt to outrun receipts, and he was in need of a substantial money-spinner. Business received an inadvertent boost from the critic Jules Janin of the . He had praised earlier productions at the Bouffes-Parisiens but was roused to vehement indignation at what he maintained was a blasphemous, lascivious outrage \u2013 \"a profanation of holy and glorious antiquity\". His attack, and the irreverent public ripostes by Cr\u00e9mieux and Offenbach, made headlines and provoked huge interest in the piece among the Parisian public, who flocked to see it. In his 1980 study of Offenbach, Alexander Faris writes, \" became not only a triumph, but a cult.\" It ran for 228 performances, at a time when a run of 100 nights was considered a success. Albert Lasalle, in his history of the Bouffes-Parisiens (1860), wrote that the piece closed in June 1859 \u2013 although it was still performing strongly at the box-office \u2013 \"because the actors, who could not tire the public, were themselves exhausted\".\nIn 1874 Offenbach substantially expanded the piece, doubling the length of the score and turning the intimate op\u00e9ra bouffon of 1858 into a four-act op\u00e9ra f\u00e9erie extravaganza, with substantial ballet sequences. This version opened at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9 on 7 February 1874, ran for 290 performances, and broke box-office records for that theatre. During the first run of the revised version Offenbach expanded it even further, adding ballets illustrating the kingdom of Neptune in Act 3 and bringing the total number of scenes in the four acts to twenty-two.\nSynopsis.\nOriginal two-act version.\nAct 1, Scene 1: The countryside near Thebes, Ancient Greece.\nA spoken introduction with orchestral accompaniment (Introduction and Melodrame) opens the work. Public Opinion explains who she is \u2013 the guardian of morality (). She says that unlike the chorus in Ancient Greek plays she does not merely comment on the action, but intervenes in it, to make sure the story maintains a high moral tone. Her efforts are hampered by the facts of the matter: Orph\u00e9e is not the son of Apollo, as in classical myth, but a rustic teacher of music, whose dislike of his wife, Eurydice, is heartily reciprocated. She is in love with the shepherd, Arist\u00e9e (Aristaeus), who lives next door (), and Orph\u00e9e is in love with Chlo\u00eb, a shepherdess. When Orph\u00e9e mistakes Eurydice for her, everything comes out, and Eurydice insists they abandon the marriage. Orph\u00e9e, fearing Public Opinion's reaction, torments his wife into keeping the scandal quiet using violin music, which she hates ().\nArist\u00e9e enters. Though seemingly a shepherd he is in reality Pluton (Pluto), God of the Underworld. He keeps up his disguise by singing a pastoral song about sheep (). Eurydice has discovered what she thinks is a plot by Orph\u00e9e to kill Arist\u00e9e \u2013 letting snakes loose in the fields \u2013 but is in fact a conspiracy between Orph\u00e9e and Pluton to kill her, so that Pluton may have her and Orph\u00e9e be rid of her. Pluton tricks her into walking into the trap by showing immunity to it, and she is bitten. As she dies, Pluton transforms into his true form (Transformation Scene). Eurydice finds that death is not so bad when the God of Death is in love with one (). They descend into the Underworld as soon as Eurydice has left a note telling her husband she has been unavoidably detained.\nAll seems to be going well for Orph\u00e9e until Public Opinion catches up with him, and threatens to ruin his violin teaching career unless he goes to rescue his wife. Orph\u00e9e reluctantly agrees.\nAct 1, Scene 2: Olympus.\nThe scene changes to Olympus, where the Gods are sleeping (). Cupidon and V\u00e9nus enter separately from amatory nocturnal escapades and join their sleeping colleagues, but everyone is soon woken by the sound of the horn of Diane, supposedly chaste huntress and goddess. She laments the sudden absence of Actaeon, her current love (); to her indignation, Jupiter tells her he has turned Actaeon into a stag to protect her reputation. Mercury arrives and reports that he has visited the Underworld, to which Pluton has just returned with a beautiful woman. Pluton enters, and is taken to task by Jupiter for his scandalous private life. To Pluton's relief the other Gods choose this moment to revolt against Jupiter's reign, their boring diet of ambrosia and nectar, and the sheer tedium of Olympus (). Jupiter's demands to know what is going on lead them to point out his hypocrisy in detail, poking fun at all his mythological affairs ().\nOrph\u00e9e's arrival, with Public Opinion at his side, has the gods on their best behaviour (). Orph\u00e9e obeys Public Opinion and pretends to be pining for Eurydice: he illustrates his supposed pain with a snatch of from Gluck's . Pluton is worried he will be forced to give Eurydice back; Jupiter announces that he is going to the Underworld to sort everything out. The other gods beg to come with him, he consents, and mass celebrations break out at this holiday ().\nAct 2, Scene 1: Pluton's boudoir in the Underworld.\nEurydice is being kept locked up by Pluton, and is finding life very tedious. Her gaoler is a dull-witted tippler by the name of John Styx. Before he died, he was King of Boeotia (a region of Greece that Aristophanes made synonymous with country bumpkins), and he sings Eurydice a doleful lament for his lost kingship ().\nJupiter discovers where Pluton has hidden Eurydice, and slips through the keyhole by turning into a beautiful, golden fly. He meets Eurydice on the other side, and sings a love duet with her where his part consists entirely of buzzing (). Afterwards, he reveals himself to her, and promises to help her, largely because he wants her for himself. Pluton is left furiously berating John Styx.\nAct 2, Scene 2: The banks of the Styx.\nThe scene shifts to a huge party the gods are having, where ambrosia, nectar, and propriety are nowhere to be seen (). Eurydice is present, disguised as a bacchante (), but Jupiter's plan to sneak her out is interrupted by calls for a dance. Jupiter insists on a minuet, which everybody else finds boring (). Things liven up as the most famous number in the opera, the \"Galop infernal\", begins, and all present throw themselves into it with wild abandon ().\nOminous violin music heralds the approach of Orph\u00e9e (Entrance of Orph\u00e9e and Public Opinion), but Jupiter has a plan, and promises to keep Eurydice away from her husband. As with the standard myth, Orph\u00e9e must not look back, or he will lose Eurydice forever (). Public Opinion keeps a close eye on him, to keep him from cheating, but Jupiter throws a lightning bolt, making him jump and look back, and Eurydice vanishes. Amid the ensuing turmoil, Jupiter proclaims that she will henceforth belong to the god Bacchus and become one of his priestesses. Public Opinion is not pleased, but Pluton has had enough of Eurydice, Orph\u00e9e is free of her, and all ends happily.\nRevised 1874 version.\nThe plot is essentially that of the 1858 version. Instead of two acts with two scenes apiece, the later version is in four acts, which follow the plot of the four scenes of the original. The revised version differs from the first in having several interpolated ballet sequences, and some extra characters and musical numbers. The additions do not affect the main narrative but add considerably to the length of the score. In Act I there is an opening chorus for assembled shepherds and shepherdesses, and Orpheus has a group of youthful violin students, who bid him farewell at the end of the act. In Act 2 Mercure is given a solo entrance number (). In Act 3, Eurydice has a new solo, the (), Cupidon has a new number, the (), the three judges of Hades and a little band of policemen are added to the cast to be involved in Jupiter's search for the concealed Eurydice, and at the end of the act the furious Pluton is seized and carried off by a swarm of flies.\nMusic.\nThe score of the opera, which formed the pattern for the many full-length Offenbach operas that followed, is described by Faris as having an \"abundance of couplets\" (songs with repeated verses for one or more singers), \"a variety of other solos and duets, several big choruses, and two extended finales\". Offenbach wrote in a variety of styles \u2013 from Rococo pastoral vein, via pastiche of Italian opera, to the uproarious galop \u2013 displaying, in Faris's analysis, many of his personal hallmarks, such as melodies that \"leap backwards and forwards in a remarkably acrobatic manner while still sounding not only smoothly lyrical, but spontaneous as well\". In such up-tempo numbers as the \"Galop infernal\", Offenbach makes a virtue of simplicity, often keeping to the same key through most of the number, with largely unvarying instrumentation throughout. Elsewhere in the score Offenbach gives the orchestra greater prominence. In the Jupiter's part, consisting of buzzing like a fly, is accompanied by the first and second violins playing sul ponticello, to produce a similarly buzzing sound. In , Gustave Lafargue remarked that Offenbach's use of a piccolo trill punctuated by a tap on a cymbal in the finale of the first scene was a modern recreation of an effect invented by Gluck in his score of . Wilfrid Mellers also remarks on Offenbach's use of the piccolo to enhance Eurydice's couplets with \"girlish giggles\" on the instrument. Gervase Hughes comments on the elaborate scoring of the [Act 3, 1874 version], and calls it \"a \"tour de force\"\" that could have inspired Tchaikovsky.\nFaris comments that in Offenbach shows that he was a master of establishing mood by the use of rhythmic figures. Faris instances three numbers from the second act (1858 version), which all are in the key of A major and use identical notes in almost the same order, \"but it would be hard to imagine a more extreme difference in feeling than that between the song of the King of the Boeotians and the \"Galop\"\". In a 2014 study Heather Hadlock comments that for the former, Offenbach composed \"a languid yet restless melody\" over a static musette-style drone-bass accompaniment of alternating dominant and tonic harmonies, simultaneously evoking and mocking nostalgia for a lost place and time and \"creating a perpetually unresolved tension between pathos and irony\". Mellers finds that Styx's aria has \"a pathos that touches the heart\" \u2013 perhaps, he suggests, the only instance of true feeling in the opera.\nIn 1999 Thomas Schipperges wrote in the \"International Journal of Musicology\" that many scholars hold that Offenbach's music defies all musicological methods. He did not agree, and analysed the \"Galop infernal\", finding it to be sophisticated in many details: \"For all its straightforwardness, it reveals a calculated design. The overall 'economy' of the piece serves a deliberate musical dramaturgy.\" Hadlock observes that although the best-known music in the opera is \"driven by the propulsive energies of Rossinian comedy\" and the up-tempo galop, such lively numbers go side by side with statelier music in an 18th-century vein: \"The score's sophistication results from Offenbach's intertwining of contemporary urban musical language with a restrained and wistful tone that is undermined and ironized without ever being entirely undone\".\n was the first of Offenbach's major works to have a chorus. In a 2017 study Melissa Cummins comments that although the composer used the chorus extensively as Pluton's minions, bored residents of Olympus, and bacchantes in Hades, they are merely there to fill out the vocal parts in the large ensemble numbers, and \"are treated as a nameless, faceless crowd who just happen to be around.\" In the Olympus scene the chorus has an unusual bocca chiusa section, marked \"Bouche ferm\u00e9e\", an effect later used by Bizet in \"Djamileh\" and Puccini in the \"Humming Chorus\" in \"Madama Butterfly\".\nEditions.\nThe orchestra at the Bouffes-Parisiens was small \u2013 probably about thirty players. The 1858 version of is scored for two flutes (the second doubling piccolo), one oboe, two clarinets, one bassoon, two horns, two cornets, one trombone, timpani, percussion (bass drum/cymbals, triangle), and strings. The Offenbach scholar Jean-Christophe Keck speculates that the string sections consisted of at most six first violins, four second violins, three violas, four cellos, and one double bass. The 1874 score calls for considerably greater orchestral forces: Offenbach added additional parts for woodwind, brass and percussion sections. For the premiere of the revised version he engaged an orchestra of sixty players, as well as a military band of a further forty players for the procession of the gods from Olympus at the end of the second act.\nThe music of the 1874 revision was well received by contemporary reviewers, but some later critics have felt the longer score, with its extended ballet sections, has occasional dull patches. Nonetheless, some of the added numbers, particularly Cupidon's , Mercure's rondo , and the \"Policeman's Chorus\" have gained favour, and some or all are often added to performances otherwise using the 1858 text.\nFor more than a century after the composer's death one cause of critical reservations about this and his other works was the persistence of what the musicologist Nigel Simeone has called \"botched, butchered and bowdlerised\" versions. Since the beginning of the 21st century a project has been under way to release scholarly and reliable scores of Offenbach's operas, under the editorship of Keck. The first to be published, in 2002, was the 1858 version of . The Offenbach Edition Keck has subsequently published the 1874 score, and another drawing on both the 1858 and 1874 versions.\nOverture and galop.\nThe best-known and much-recorded overture is not by Offenbach, and is not part of either the 1858 or the 1874 scores. It was arranged by the Austrian musician Carl Binder (1816\u20131860) for the first production of the opera in Vienna, in 1860. Offenbach's 1858 score has a short orchestral introduction of 104 bars; it begins with a quiet melody for woodwind, followed by the theme of Jupiter's Act 2 minuet, in A\u266d major and segues via a mock-pompous fugue in F major into Public Opinion's opening monologue. The overture to the 1874 revision is a 393-bar piece, in which Jupiter's minuet and John Styx's song recur, interspersed with many themes from the score including , the couplets , the , the section of the Act 2 finale, and the Act 4 galop.\nFifteen years or so after Offenbach's death the galop from Act 2 (or Act 4 in the 1874 version) became one of the world's most famous pieces of music, when the Moulin Rouge and the Folies Berg\u00e8re adopted it as the regular music for their can-can. Keck has commented that the original \"infernal galop\" was a considerably more spontaneous and riotous affair than the can-can (Keck likens the original to a modern rave) but the tune is now inseparable in the public mind from high-kicking female can-can dancers.\nReception.\n19th century.\nFrom the outset divided critical opinion. Janin's furious condemnation did the work much more good than harm, and was in contrast with the laudatory review of the premiere by Jules Noriac in the , which called the work, \"unprecedented, splendid, outrageous, gracious, delightful, witty, amusing, successful, perfect, tuneful\". Bertrand Jouvin, in , criticised some of the cast but praised the staging \u2013 \"a fantasy show, which has all the variety, all the surprises of fairy-opera\". The thought that though it would be wrong to expect too much in a piece of this genre, was one of Offenbach's most outstanding works, with charming couplets for Eurydice, Arist\u00e9e-Pluton and the King of Boeotia. called the cast \"thoroughbreds\" who did full justice to \"all the charming jokes, all the delicious originalities, all the farcical oddities thrown in profusion into Offenbach's music\".\nWriting of the 1874 revised version, the authors of said, \" is above all a good show. The music of Offenbach has retained its youth and spirit. The amusing operetta of yore has become a splendid extravaganza\", against which F\u00e9lix Cl\u00e9ment and Pierre Larousse wrote in their (1881) that the piece is \"a coarse and grotesque parody\" full of \"vulgar and indecent scenes\" that \"give off an unhealthy smell\".\nThe opera was widely seen as containing thinly disguised satire of the r\u00e9gime of Napoleon III, but the early press criticisms of the work focused on its mockery of revered classical authors such as Ovid and the equally sacrosanct music of Gluck's . Faris comments that the satire perpetrated by Offenbach and his librettists was cheeky rather than hard-hitting, and Richard Taruskin in his study of 19th-century music observes, \"The calculated licentiousness and feigned sacrilege, which successfully baited the stuffier critics, were recognized by all for what they were \u2013 a social palliative, the very opposite of social criticism[...] The spectacle of the Olympian gods doing the cancan threatened nobody's dignity.\" The Emperor greatly enjoyed when he saw it at a command performance in 1860; he told Offenbach he would \"never forget that dazzling evening\".\n20th and 21st centuries.\nAfter Offenbach's death his reputation in France suffered a temporary eclipse. In Faris's words, his comic operas were \"dismissed as irrelevant and meretricious souvenirs of a discredited Empire\". Obituarists in other countries similarly took it for granted that the comic operas, including , were ephemeral and would be forgotten. By the time of the composer's centenary, in 1919, it had been clear for some years that such predictions had been wrong. was frequently revived, as were several more of his operas, and criticisms on moral or musical grounds had largely ceased. Gabriel Groviez wrote in \"The Musical Quarterly\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAmong modern critics, Traubner describes as \"the first great full-length classical French operetta[...] classical (in both senses of the term)\", although he regards the 1874 revision as \"overblown\". Peter Gammond writes that the public appreciated the frivolity of the work while recognising that it is rooted in the best traditions of op\u00e9ra comique. Among 21st-century writers Bernard Holland has commented that the music is \"beautifully made, relentlessly cheerful, reluctantly serious\", but does not show as the later \"Tales of Hoffmann\" does \"what a profoundly gifted composer Offenbach really was\"; Andrew Lamb has commented that although has remained Offenbach's best-known work, \"a consensus as to the best of his operettas would probably prefer for its sparkle, for its charm and for its all-round brilliance\". Kurt G\u00e4nzl writes in \"The Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre\" that compared with earlier efforts, was \"something on a different scale[...] a gloriously imaginative parody of classic mythology and of modern events decorated with Offenbach's most laughing bouffe music.\" In a 2014 study of parody and burlesque in , Hadlock writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;With , the genre we now know as operetta gathered its forces and leapt forward, while still retaining the quick, concise style of its one-act predecessors, their absurdist and risqu\u00e9 sensibility, and their economy in creating maximum comic impact with limited resources. At the same time, it reflects Offenbach's desire to establish himself and his company as legitimate heirs of the eighteenth-century French comic tradition of Philidor and Gr\u00e9try.\nRevivals.\nFrance.\nBetween the first run and the first Paris revival, in 1860, the Bouffes-Parisiens company toured the French provinces, where was reported as meeting with \"immense\" and \"incredible\" success\". Tautin was succeeded as Eurydice by Delphine Ugalde when the production was revived at the Bouffes-Parisiens in 1862 and again in 1867.\nThe first revival of the 1874 version was at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9 in 1875 with Marie Blanche Peschard as Eurydice. It was revived again there in January 1878 with Meyronnet (Orph\u00e9e), Peschard (Eurydice), Christian (Jupiter), Habay (Pluton) and Pierre Grivot as both Mercure and John Styx, For the Exposition Universelle season later that year Offenbach revived the piece again, with Grivot as Orph\u00e9e, Peschard as Eurydice, the composer's old friend and rival Herv\u00e9 as Jupiter and L\u00e9once as Pluton. The opera was seen again at the Ga\u00eet\u00e9 in 1887 with Taufenberger (Orph\u00e9e), Jeanne Granier (Eurydice), Eug\u00e8ne Vauthier (Jupiter) and Alexandre (Pluton). There was a revival at the \u00c9den-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre (1889) with Minart, Granier, Christian and Alexandre.\n20th-century revivals in Paris included productions at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s (1902) with Charles Prince (Orph\u00e9e), Juliette M\u00e9aly (Eurydice), Guy (Jupiter) and Albert Brasseur (Pluton), and in 1912 with Paul Bourillon, M\u00e9aly, Guy and Prince; the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Mogador (1931) with Adrien Lamy, Manse Beaujon, Max Dearly and Lucien Muratore; the Op\u00e9ra-Comique (1970) with R\u00e9my Corazza, Anne-Marie Sanial, Michel Roux and Robert Andreozzi; the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eft\u00e9-Lyrique (1972) with Jean Giraudeau, Jean Brun, Albert Voli and Sanial; and by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre fran\u00e7ais de l'Op\u00e9rette at the Espace Cardin (1984) with multiple casts including (in alphabetical order) Andr\u00e9 Dran, Maarten Koningsberger, Martine March, Martine Masquelin, Marcel Quillevere, Ghyslaine Raphanel, Bernard Sinclair and Michel Trempont. In January 1988 the work received its first performances at the Paris Op\u00e9ra, with Michel S\u00e9n\u00e9chal (Orph\u00e9e), Danielle Borst (Eurydice), Fran\u00e7ois Le Roux (Jupiter), and Laurence Dale (Pluton).\nIn December 1997 a production by Laurent Pelly was seen at the Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon, where it was filmed for DVD, with Yann Beuron (Orph\u00e9e), Natalie Dessay (Eurydice), Laurent Naouri (Jupiter) and Jean-Paul Fouch\u00e9court (Pluton) with Marc Minkowski conducting. The production originated in Geneva, where it had been given in September \u2013 in a former hydroelectric plant used while the stage area of the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre was being renovated \u2013 by a cast headed by Beuron, Annick Massis, Naouri, and \u00c9ric Huchet.\nContinental Europe.\nThe first production outside France is believed to have been at Breslau in October 1859. In December of the same year the opera opened in Prague. The work was given in German at the Carltheater, Vienna, in March 1860 in a version by Ludwig Kalisch, revised and embellished by Johann Nestroy, who played Jupiter. Making fun of Graeco-Roman mythology had a long tradition in the popular theatre of Vienna, and audiences had no difficulty with the disrespect that had outraged Jules Janin and others in Paris. It was for this production that Carl Binder put together the version of the overture that is now the best known. There were revivals at the same theatre in February and June 1861 (both given in French) and at the Theater an der Wien in January 1867. 1860 saw the work's local premieres in Brussels, Stockholm, Copenhagen and Berlin. Productions followed in Warsaw, St Petersburg, and Budapest, and then Zurich, Madrid, Amsterdam, Milan and Naples.\nG\u00e4nzl mentions among \"countless other productions[...] a large and glitzy German revival under Max Reinhardt\" at the Gro\u00dfes Schauspielhaus, Berlin in 1922. A more recent Berlin production was directed by G\u00f6tz Friedrich in 1983; a video of the production was released. 2019 productions include those directed by Helmut Baumann at the Vienna Volksoper, and by Barrie Kosky at the Haus f\u00fcr Mozart, Salzburg, with a cast headed by Anne Sophie von Otter as L'Opinion publique, a co-production between the Salzburg Festival, Komische Oper Berlin and Deutsche Oper am Rhein.\nBritain.\nThe first London production of the work was at Her Majesty's Theatre in December 1865, in an English version by J. R. Planch\u00e9 titled \"Orpheus in the Haymarket\". There were West End productions in the original French in 1869 and 1870 by companies headed by Hortense Schneider. English versions followed by Alfred Thompson (1876) and Henry S. Leigh (1877). An adaptation by Herbert Beerbohm Tree and Alfred Noyes opened at His Majesty's in 1911. The opera was not seen again in London until 1960, when a new adaptation by Geoffrey Dunn opened at Sadler's Wells Theatre; this production by Wendy Toye was frequently revived between 1960 and 1974. An English version by Snoo Wilson for English National Opera (ENO), mounted at the London Coliseum in 1985, was revived there in 1987. A co-production by Opera North and the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in a version by Jeremy Sams opened in 1992 and was revived several times. In 2019 ENO presented a new production directed by Emma Rice, which opened to unfavourable reviews. \nOutside Europe.\nThe first New York production was at the Stadt Theater, in German, in March 1861; the production ran until February 1862. Two more productions were sung in German: December 1863 with Fritze, Knorr, Klein and Frin von Hedemann and December 1866 with Br\u00fcgmann, Knorr, Klein and Frin Steglich-Fuchs. The opera was produced at the Theatre Fran\u00e7ais in January 1867 with Elvira Naddie, and at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in April 1868 with Lucille Tost\u00e9e. In December 1883 it was produced at the Bijou Theatre with Max Freeman, Marie Vanoni, Digby Bell and Harry Pepper. There were productions in Rio de Janeiro in 1865, Buenos Aires in 1866, Mexico City in 1867 and Valparaiso in 1868. The opera was first staged in Australia at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne in March 1872, in Planch\u00e9's London text, with Alice May as Eurydice.\nA spectacular production by Reinhardt was presented in New York in 1926. The New York City Opera staged the work, conducted by Erich Leinsdorf, in 1956, with Sylvia Stahlman as Eurydice and Norman Kelley as Pluto. More recent US productions have included a 1985 version by Santa Fe Opera, and the 1985 ENO version, which was staged in the US by the Houston Grand Opera (co-producers) in 1986, and Los Angeles Opera in 1989.\n21st century worldwide.\nIn April 2019 the Operabase website recorded 25 past or scheduled productions of the opera from 2016 onwards, in French or in translation: nine in Germany, four in France, two in Britain, two in Switzerland, two in the US, and productions in Gda\u0144sk, Li\u00e8ge, Ljubljana, Malm\u00f6, Prague and Tokyo.\nRecordings.\nAudio.\nIn French.\nThere are three full-length recordings. The first, from 1951 features the Paris Philharmonic Chorus and Orchestra, conducted by Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz, with Jean Mollien (Orph\u00e9e), Claudine Collart (Eurydice), Bernard Demigny (Jupiter) and Andr\u00e9 Dran (Pluton); it uses the 1858 version. A 1978 issue from EMI employs the expanded 1874 version; it features the Chorus and Orchestra of the Toulouse Capitol conducted by Michel Plasson, with Michel S\u00e9n\u00e9chal (Orph\u00e9e), Mady Mespl\u00e9 (Eurydice), Michel Trempont (Jupiter) and Charles Burles (Pluton). A 1997 recording of the 1858 score with some additions from the 1874 revision features the Chorus and Orchestra of the Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon, conducted by Marc Minkowski, with Yann Beuron (Orph\u00e9e), Natalie Dessay (Eurydice), Laurent Naouri (Jupiter) and Jean-Paul Fouch\u00e9court (Pluton).\nIn English.\nAs at 2022[ [update]] the only recording of the full work made in English is the 1995 D'Oyly Carte production, conducted by John Owen Edwards with David Fieldsend (Orpheus), Mary Hegarty (Eurydice), Richard Suart (Jupiter), and Barry Patterson (Pluto). It uses the 1858 score with some additions from the 1874 revision. The English text is by Jeremy Sams. Extended excerpts were recorded of two earlier productions: Sadler's Wells (1960), conducted by Alexander Faris, with June Bronhill as Eurydice and Eric Shilling as Jupiter; and English National Opera (1985), conducted by Mark Elder, with Stuart Kale (Orpheus), Lillian Watson (Eurydice), Richard Angas (Jupiter) and \u00c9mile Belcourt (Pluto).\nIn German.\nThere have been three full-length recordings in German. The first, recorded in 1958, features the North German Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus conducted by Paul Burkhard, with Heinz Hoppe (Orpheus), Anneliese Rothenberger as Eurydice (Eurydike), Max Hansen as Jupiter and Ferry Gruber as Pluto. Rothenberger repeated her role in a 1978 EMI set, with the Philharmonia Hungarica and Cologne Opera Chorus conducted by Willy Mattes, with Adolf Dellapozza (Orpheus), Benno Kusche (Jupiter) and Gruber (Pluto). A recording based on the 1983 Berlin production by G\u00f6tz Friedrich features the Orchestra and Chorus of Deutsche Oper Berlin, conducted by Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez Cobos, with Donald Grobe (Orpheus), Julia Migenes (Eurydike), Hans Beirer (Jupiter) and George Shirley (Pluto).\nVideo.\nRecordings have been released on DVD based on Herbert Wernicke's 1997 production at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie, Brussels, with Alexandru Badea (Orpheus), Elizabeth Vidal (Eurydice), Dale Duesing (Jupiter) and Reinaldo Macias (Pluton), and Laurent Pelly's production from the same year, with Natalie Dessay (Eurydice), Yann Beuron (Orph\u00e9e), Laurent Naouri (Jupiter) and Jean-Paul Fouch\u00e9court (Pluton). A version in English made for the BBC in 1983 has been issued on DVD. It is conducted by Faris and features Alexander Oliver (Orpheus), Lillian Watson (Eurydice), Denis Quilley (Jupiter) and \u00c9mile Belcourt (Pluto). The Berlin production by Friedrich was filmed in 1984 and has been released as a DVD; a DVD of the Salzburg Festival production directed by Kosky was published in 2019.\nNotes, references and sources.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Trilogy\nHagbard Celine is a central protagonist in \"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\" series of books by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson named after the legendary Viking hero Hagbard, who died for love. In the \"Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat Trilogy\" written after \"Illuminatus!\", it is stated that \"Hagbard Celine\" is a pseudonym and that his legal name is Howard Crane. However, the trilogy passes through many different universes.\nCharacter.\nHagbard has parallels to Jules Verne's character, Captain Nemo. Both are genius captains aboard a fantastic submarine. Both are rogues who have mostly broken off from society, yet help the oppressed. Some have even theorized that Hagbard Celine is Captain Nemo, though Verne's \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas\" is set in the second half of the nineteenth century. He is also comparable to a degree to Ragnar Danneskjold, a libertarian pirate in Ayn Rand's novel \"Atlas Shrugged\", which is spoofed in the chronicles as \"Telemachus Sneezed\". Like Danneskjold, Hagbard participates in the black market, exploiting and resisting governments, and both characters have Norwegian roots.\nHagbard is a notorious prankster and liar (telling one character not to trust anyone with the initials H.C.). This character trait is displayed throughout \"Illuminatus!\". Celine tends to give misinformation about himself and his intentions and that he faked the death of an actress, implied to be Marilyn Monroe, in order to train her into becoming an embodiment of the goddess Eris. Celine subsequently fell in love with the woman and announces his intention to marry her during the trilogy.\nA Discordian anarchist, he fights the Illuminati from a golden submarine, the \"Leif Ericson\" (named after the Viking explorer). The submarine was supposedly designed and built by himself, stolen from the United States Navy, or a gift from the Mafia. Despite its size\u2014the equivalent of five city blocks long with a three-story-high conning tower\u2014it has so far remained undetected.\nHe has a Norwegian mother and a Sicilian father, physically resembling Anthony Quinn. In a section printed in the introductions of volumes I and II of the trilogy, though not reprinted in the single-volume compilation, the narrator mentions that he has a raft of Irish relatives in Ohio named McGee and Marlowe. Wilson also implies in \"The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles\" that Hagbard is related to one of the central characters, Sigismundo Celine.\nHe speaks Norwegian, Italian, English, German, Latin, Greek and Swahili. He graduated from Harvard with a somewhat strange double major in contract law and naval engineering.\nA former naturalized United States citizen, Hagbard supposedly relinquished his citizenship after representing a Mohawk reservation in court against the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Hagbard generally told people he was an engineer building a dam during his time with the Mohawk because he was ashamed of being a lawyer.\nHe later became a citizen of Equatorial Guinea, of which Fernando Poo is a part, having papers referring to this by the time of the Walpurgisnacht rock concert. The appendix to the trilogy mentions that Hagbard builds a starship and leaves to explore Alpha Centauri in the year 1999.\nHagbard designed a supercomputer called the First Universal Cybernetic Kinetic Ultramicro-Programmer. Among other things, he used to calculate the chances of World War III starting, which it does by throwing virtual I Ching sticks.\nHis manifesto is called \"Never Whistle While You're Pissing\", containing his \"Definitions and Distinctions\", an anarchist interpretation of capitalist concepts.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is not spherical but is shaped like an ellipsoid of approximately 380\u00d7330\u00d7250\u00a0km. It was discovered on 4 February 1858, by Hermann Goldschmidt from his balcony in Paris. It is named after Europa, one of Zeus's conquests in Greek mythology, a name it shares with Jupiter's moon Europa.\nPhysical characteristics.\nEuropa is approximately the sixth largest asteroid by volume. Most likely it has a density of around 1.5 g/cm3, typical of C-type asteroids. In 2007, James Baer and Steven R. Chesley estimated Europa to have a mass of \u00a0kg. A more recent estimate by Baer suggests it has a mass of 3.27\u00d71019 kg.\nEuropa is a very dark carbonaceous C-type, and is the second largest of this group. Spectroscopic studies have found evidence of olivines and pyroxenes on the surface, and there is some indication that there may be compositional differences between different regions. It orbits close to the Hygiea asteroid family, but is not a member.\nLightcurve data for Europa have been particularly tricky to interpret, so much so that for a long time its period of rotation was in dispute (ranging from &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;5+1\u20442 hours to 11 hours), despite numerous observations. It has now been determined that Europa is a prograde rotator, but the exact direction in which its pole points remains ambiguous. The most detailed analysis indicates that it points either towards about ecliptic coordinates (\u03b2, \u03bb) = (70\u00b0, 55\u00b0) or (40\u00b0, 255\u00b0) with a 10\u00b0 uncertainty. This gives an axial tilt of about 14\u00b0 or 54\u00b0, respectively.\nIn 1988 a search for satellites or dust orbiting this asteroid was performed using the UH88 telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories, but the effort came up empty.\nObservations.\nIt has been found that the reputed cataclysmic variable star CV Aquarii, discovered in 1934, was actually a misidentification of 52 Europa.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47210", "revid": "50892247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47210", "title": "Vesta (mythology)", "text": "Ancient Roman goddess of the hearth, home, and family\nVesta () is the virgin goddess of the hearth, home, and family in Roman religion. She was rarely depicted in human form, and was more often represented by the fire of her temple in the Forum Romanum. Entry to her temple was permitted only to her priestesses, the Vestal Virgins. Their virginity was deemed essential to Rome's survival; if found guilty of inchastity, they were buried or entombed alive. As Vesta was considered a guardian of the Roman people, her festival, the \"Vestalia\" (7\u201315 June), was regarded as one of the most important Roman holidays. During the \"Vestalia\" privileged matrons walked barefoot through the city to the temple, where they presented food-offerings. Such was Vesta's importance to Roman religion that following the rise of Christianity, hers was one of the last non-Christian cults still active, until it was forcibly disbanded by the Christian emperor Theodosius I in AD 391.\nThe myths depicting Vesta and her priestesses were few; the most notable of them were tales of miraculous impregnation of a virgin priestess by a phallus appearing in the flames of the sacred hearth \u2014 the manifestation of the goddess combined with a male supernatural being. In some Roman traditions, Rome's founders Romulus and Remus and the benevolent king Servius Tullius were conceived in this way. Vesta was among the \"Dii Consentes\", twelve of the most honored gods in the Roman pantheon. She was the daughter of Saturn and Ops, and sister of Jupiter, Neptune, Pluto, Juno, and Ceres. Her Greek equivalent is Hestia.\nEtymology.\nOvid derived Vesta from Latin \u2013 \"standing by power\". Cicero supposed that the Latin name \"Vesta\" derives from its Greek counterpart, \"Hestia\", which Cornutus claimed to have derived from Greek (\"standing for ever\"). This etymology is offered by Servius as well. Another proposed etymology is that Vesta derives from Latin (\"clothe\"), as well as from Greek (\"hestia\", \"hearth\" = \"focus urbis\"). None, except perhaps the last, are probable.\nGeorges Dum\u00e9zil (1898\u20131986), a French comparative philologist, surmised that the name of the goddess derives from Proto-Indo-European root \"*h\u2081eu-\", via the derivative form \"*h\u2081eu-s-\" which alternates with \"*h\u2081w-es-\". The former is found in Greek \u03b5\u1f55\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd , Latin , and Vedic \"osathi\" all conveying 'burning' and the second is found in \"Vesta\". (Beekes considers the Greek goddess-name \u1f19\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 \"Hestia\" is probably unrelated.) See also Gallic Celtic \"visc\" \"fire.\"\nPoultney suggests that Vesta may be related to the Umbrian god \"Uestisier\" (gen.)/\"Vesti\u00e7e\" (dat.) (as if Latin *Vesticius), itself related to Umbrian terms for 'libation' \"uestisiar\" (gen.sg.), 'pour a libation' \"uesticatu\" (imv.) from *\"westikia\" and *\"westikato:d\" respectively. Perhaps also related to Oscan \"Veske\u00ed\" from the Oscan Tablet also known as the Agnone Dedication.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nAccording to tradition, worship of Vesta in Italy began in Lavinium, the mother-city of Alba Longa and the first settlement by the Trojan refugees after their flight from Troy's destruction, led there by Aeneas and guided by Venus. It was believed that from Lavinium, the worship of Vesta was transferred to Alba Longa, a belief evident in the custom of Roman magistrates going to Lavinium, when appointed to higher office, and offering sacrifice both to Vesta and the household gods of the Roman state known as Penates, whose images were kept in Vesta's temple. Alongside those household gods was Vesta, whom the Roman poet refers to as \"Vesta Iliaca\" (\"Vesta of Ilium/Troy\"). Vesta's sacred hearth was also named \"Iliaci foci\" (\"hearth of Ilium/Troy\").\nWorship of Vesta, like the worship of many gods, originated in the home, but in Roman historical tradition, it became an established cult of state during the reign of either Romulus, or Numa Pompilius (sources disagree, but most say Numa). The priestesses of Vesta, known as Vestal Virgins, administered her temple and sustained its sacred fire. The existence of Vestal Virgins in Alba Longa is connected with early Roman traditions, for the mother of Romulus and Remus, Rhea Silvia, was a priestess of Vesta, impregnated by either Mars or Hercules.\nRoman Empire.\nRoman tradition required that the leading priest of the Roman state, the \"pontifex maximus\" reside in a \"domus publicus\" (\"publicly owned house\"). After assuming the office of \"pontifex maximus\" in 12\u00a0BC, Augustus gave part of his private house to the Vestals as public property and incorporated a new shrine of Vesta within it. The old shrine remained in the \"Forum Romanum\"'s temple of Vesta, but Augustus' gift linked the public hearth of the state with the official home of the \"pontifex maximus\" and the emperor's Palatine residence. This strengthened the connection between the office of \"pontifex maximus\" and the cult of Vesta. Henceforth, the office of \"pontifex maximus\" was tied to the title of emperor; Emperors were automatically priests of Vesta, and the \"pontifices\" were sometimes referred to as \"pontifices Vestae\" (\"priests of Vesta\"). In 12\u00a0BC, 28 April (first of the five day \"Floralia\") was chosen \"ex senatus consultum\" to commemorate the new shrine of Vesta in Augustus' home on the Palatine. The latter's hearth was the focus of the Imperial household's traditional religious observances. Various emperors led official revivals and promotions of the Vestals' cult, which in its various locations remained central to Rome's ancient traditional cults into the 4th century. Dedications in the Atrium of Vesta, dating predominantly AD 200 to 300, attest to the service of several \"Virgines Vestales Maxime\". Vesta's worship began to decline with the rise of Christianity. In ca. 379, Gratian stepped down as \"pontifex maximus\"; in 382 he confiscated the \"Atrium Vestae\" and simultaneously withdrew its public funding. In 391, despite official and public protests, Theodosius I closed the temple, and extinguished the sacred flame. Finally, Coelia Concordia stepped down as the last \"Vestalis Maxima\" (\"chief Vestal\") in 394.\nDepictions.\nDepicted as a good-mannered deity who never involved herself in the quarreling of other gods, Vesta was ambiguous at times due to her contradictory association with the phallus. She is considered the embodiment of the \"Phallic Mother\" by proponents of 20th Century psychoanalysis: she was not only the most virgin and clean of all the gods, but was addressed as mother and granted fertility. Mythographers tell us that Vesta had no myths save being identified as one of the oldest of the gods who was entitled to preference in veneration and offerings over all other gods. Unlike most gods, Vesta was hardly depicted directly; nonetheless, she was symbolized by her flame, the fire stick, and a ritual phallus (the \"fascinus\").\nWhile Vesta was the flame itself, the symbol of the phallus might relate to Vesta's function in fertility cults, but it maybe also invoked the goddess herself due to its relation to the fire stick used to light the sacred flame. She was sometimes thought of as a personification of the fire stick which was inserted into a hollow piece of wood and rotated \u2013 in a phallic manner \u2013 to light her flame.\nHearth.\nConcerning the status of Vesta's hearth, Dionysius of Halicarnassus had this to say: \"And they regard the fire as consecrated to Vesta, because that goddess, being the Earth and occupying the central position in the universe, kindles the celestial fires from herself.\" Ovid agreed, saying: \"Vesta is the same as the earth; both have the perennial fire: the Earth and the sacred Fire are both symbolic of home.\" The sacred flames of the hearth were believed to be indispensable for the preservation and continuity of the Roman State: Cicero states it explicitly. The purity of the flames symbolised the vital force that is the root of the life of the community. It was also because the virgins' ritual concern extended to the agricultural cycle and ensured a good harvest that Vesta enjoyed the title of \"Mater\" (\"Mother\").\nThe fecundating power of sacred fire is testified to in Plutarch's version of the birth of Romulus and Remus, in the birth of king Servius Tullius, whose mother Ocresia becomes pregnant after sitting upon a phallus that appeared among the ashes of the ara of the god Vulcanus by order of Tanaquil wife of king Tarquinius Priscus, and in the birth of Caeculus, the founder of Praeneste, who had the power to kindle or extinguish fires at will. All these mythical or semi-legendary characters show a mystical mastery of fire. Servius's hair was kindled by his father without hurting him, and even his statue in the temple of Fortuna Primigenia was unharmed by fire after his assassination.\nMarriage.\nVesta was connected to liminality, and the \"limen\" (\"threshold\") was sacred to her: brides were careful not to step on it, else they commit sacrilege by kicking a sacred object. Servius explains that it would be poor judgement for a virgin bride to kick an object sacred to Vesta, a goddess who holds chastity sacred. On the other hand, it might merely have been because Romans considered it bad luck to trample any object sacred to the gods. In Plautus' \"Casina\", the bride Casina is cautioned to lift her feet carefully over the threshold following her wedding so she would have the upper hand in her marriage. Likewise, Catullus cautions a bride to keep her feet over the threshold \"with a good omen\". It is possible that the concern that brides not touch the threshold (\"limen\") with their feet may be the source of the tradition of a husband carrying his new bride across the threshold when entering their new home following their marriage.\nIn Roman belief, Vesta was present in all weddings, and so was Janus: Vesta was the threshold and Janus the doorway. Similarly, Vesta and Janus were invoked in every sacrifice. It has been noted that because they were invoked so often, the evocation of the two came to simply mean, \"to pray\". In addition, Vesta was present with Janus in all sacrifices as well. It has also been noted that neither of them were consistently illustrated as human. This has been suggested as evidence of their ancient Italic origin, because neither of them was \"fully anthropomorphized\"\nAgriculture.\nCounted among the agricultural deities, Vesta has been linked to the deities Tellus and Terra in separate accounts. In \"Antiquitates rerum humanarum et divinarum\", Varro links Vesta to Tellus. He says: \"They think Tellus... is Vesta, because she is 'vested' in flowers\". Verrius Flaccus, however, had identified Vesta with Terra. Ovid hints at Vesta's connection to both of the deities.\nTemple.\nWhere the majority of temples would have a statue, that of Vesta had a hearth. The fire was a religious center of Roman worship, the common hearth (\"focus publicus\") of the whole Roman people. The Vestals were obliged to keep the sacred fire alight. If the fire went out, it must be lit from an \"arbor felix\" (\"auspicious tree\", probably an oak). Water was not allowed into the inner \"aedes\" nor could it remain longer than strictly necessary in or on the nearby premises. It was carried by the Vestales in vessels called \"futiles\" which had a tiny foot that made them unstable.\nThe temple of Vesta held not only the \"ignes aeternum\" (\"sacred fire\"), but the Palladium of Pallas Athena and the \"di Penates\" as well. Both of these items are said to have been brought into Italy by Aeneas. The Palladium of Athena was, in the words of Livy: \"fatale pignus imperii Romani\" (\"[a] pledge of destiny for the Roman empire\"). Such was the Palladium's importance that when the Gauls sacked Rome in 390\u00a0BC, the Vestals first buried the Palladium before removing themselves to the safety of nearby Caere. Such objects were kept in the \"penus Vestae\" (i.e., the sacred repository of the temple of Vesta).\nDespite being one of the most spiritual of Roman Shrines, that of Vesta was not a \"templum\" in the Roman sense of the word; that is, it was not a building consecrated by the augurs and so it could not be used for meetings by Roman officials. It has also been claimed that the shrine of Vesta in Rome was not a \"templum\" because of its round shape. However, a \"templum\" was not a building, but rather a sacred space that could contain a building of either rectangular or circular shape. In fact, early \"templa\" were often altars that were consecrated and later had buildings erected around them. The temple of Vesta in Rome was an \"aedes\" and not a \"templum\" most likely because of the character of the cult of Vesta, the exact reason being unknown.\nVestal Virgins.\nThe Vestales were one of the few full-time clergy positions in Roman religion. They were drawn from the patrician class and were required to swear an oath of absolute chastity for 30 years. It was because of this requirement that the Vestales were named the Vestal virgins. They wore a particular style of dress and were not allowed to let the fire go out on pain of a whipping. On becoming a priestess, a Vestal Virgin was legally emancipated from her father's authority. The Vestal Virgins lived together in a house near the Forum (\"Atrium Vestae\"), supervised by the Pontifex Maximus. A Vestal who broke her vow of chastity could be tried for incestum and if found guilty, buried alive in the \"Campus Sceleris\" ('Field of Wickedness').\nThe (\"lanas\": woolen threads) that were an essential part of the Vestal costume were supplied by the rex sacrorum and flamen dialis. Once a year, the Vestals gave the \"rex sacrorum\" a ritualised warning to be vigilant in his duties, using the phrase \"Vigilasne rex, vigila!\" In Cicero's opinion, the Vestals ensured that Rome kept its contact with the gods.\nA peculiar duty of the Vestals was the preparation and conservation of the sacred salamoia muries used for the savouring of the \"mola salsa\", a salted flour mixture to be sprinkled on sacrificial victims (hence the Latin verb \"immolare\", \"to put on the \"mola\", to sacrifice\"). This dough too was prepared by them on fixed days. Theirs also the task of preparing the suffimen for the Parilia.\nFestivals.\nDomestic and family life in general were represented by the festival of the goddess of the house and of the spirits of the storechamber \u2013 Vesta and the Penates \u2013 on \"Vestalia\" (7 \u2013 15 June). On the first day of festivities the \"penus Vestae\" (\"sanctum sanctorum\" of her temple which was usually curtained off) was opened, for the only time during the year, at which women offered sacrifices. As long as the curtain remained open, mothers could come, barefoot and disheveled, to leave offerings to the goddess in exchange for a blessing to them and their family. The animal consecrated to Vesta, the donkey, was crowned with garlands of flowers and bits of bread on 9 June. The final day (15 June) was Q(uando) S(tercum) D(elatum) F(as) [\"when dung may be removed lawfully\"] \u2013 the \"penus Vestae\" was solemnly closed; the \"Flaminica Dialis\" observed mourning, and the temple was subjected to a purification called \"stercoratio\": the filth was swept from the temple and carried next by the route called \"clivus Capitolinus\" and then into the Tiber.\nIn the military \"Feriale Duranum\" (AD 224) the first day of \"Vestalia\" is \"Vesta apperit[ur]\" and the last day is \"Vesta cluditur\". This year records a \"supplicatio\" dedicated to Vesta for 9 June, and records of the Arval Brethren on this day observe a blood sacrifice to her as well. Found in the Codex-Calendar of 354, 13 February had become the holiday \"Virgo Vestalis parentat\", a public holiday which by then had replaced the older \"parentalia\" where the sacrifice of cattle over flames is now dedicated to Vesta. This also marks the first participation of the Vestal Virgins in rites associated with the Manes.\nMythography.\nVesta had no official mythology, and she existed as an abstract goddess of the hearth and of chastity. Only in the account of Ovid at Cybele's party does Vesta appear directly in a myth.\nBirth of Romulus and Remus.\nPlutarch, in his \"Life of Romulus\", told a variation of Romulus' birth citing a compilation of Italian history by a Promathion. In this version, while Tarchetius was king of Alba Longa, a phantom phallus appeared in his hearth. The king visited an oracle of Tethys in Etrusca, who told him that a virgin must have intercourse with this phallus. Tarchetius instructed one of his daughters to do so, but she refused sending a handmaiden in her place. Angered, the king contemplated her execution; however, Vesta appeared to him in his sleep and forbade it. When the handmaid gave birth to twins by the phantom, Tarchetius handed them over to his subordinate, Teratius, with orders to destroy them. Teratius instead carried them to the shore of the river Tiber and laid them there. Then a she-wolf came to them and breastfed them, birds brought them food and fed them, before an amazed cow-herder came and took the children home with him. Thus they were saved, and when they were grown up, they set upon Tarchetius and overcame him. Plutarch concludes with a contrast between Promathion's version of Romulus' birth and that of the more credible Fabius Pictor which he describes in a detailed narrative and lends support to.\nConception of Servius Tullius.\nDionysius of Halicarnassus recounts a local story regarding the birth of king Servius Tullius. In it, a phallus rose from the hearth of Vesta in Numa's palace, and Ocresia was the first to see it. She immediately informed the king and queen. King Tarquinius, upon hearing this, was astonished; but Tanaquil, whose knowledge of divination was well-known, told him it was a blessing that a birth by the hearth's phallus and a mortal woman would produce superior offspring. The king then chose Ocresia to have intercourse with it, for she had seen it first. During which either Vulcan, or the tutelary deity of the house, appeared to her. After disappearing, she conceived and delivered Tullius. This story of his birth could be based on his name as Servius would euphemistically mean \"son of servant\", because his mother was a handmaiden.\nImpropriety of Priapus.\nIn book 6 of Ovid's \"Fasti\": Cybele invited all the gods, satyrs, rural divinities, and nymphs to a feast, though Silenus came uninvited with his donkey. At some point during the feast, Vesta lay at rest, and Priapus spotted her. As he approached her in order to violate her, the ass brought by Silenus let out a timely bray, whereupon Vesta awoke and Priapus barely escaped the outraged gods. Mentioned in book 1 of the \"Fasti\" is a similar instance of Priapus' impropriety involving Lotis and Priapus. The Vesta-Priapus account is not as well developed as that involving Lotis, and critics suggest the account of Vesta and Priapus only exists to create a cult drama. Ovid says the donkey was adorned with necklaces of bread-bits in memory of the event. Elsewhere, he says donkeys were honored on 9 June during the \"Vestalia\" in thanks for the services they provided in the bakeries.\nVesta outside Rome.\nVesta's cult is attested at Bovillae, Lavinium and Tibur. The Alban Vestals at Bovillae (Albanae Longanae Bovillenses) were supposedly a continuation of the original Alban Vestals, and Lavinium had the Vestals of the Laurentes Lavinates, both orders rooted in ancient traditions that were thought to predate Rome's foundation. In a later period, Tibur's vestals are attested epigraphically. Vestals might have been present at the sanctuary of Diana Nemorensis near Aricia.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nAncient.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nModern.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was discovered on 9 August 1989, by American astronomer Eleanor Helin (Caltech) on photographic plates taken at Palomar Observatory in California. It is named after Castalia, a nymph in Greek mythology. It is also a Mars- and Venus-crosser asteroid.\nGeneral information.\nOn 25 August 1989 Castalia passed (within eleven lunar distances) of Earth, allowing it to be observed with radar from the Arecibo Observatory by Scott Hudson (Washington State University) and Steven J. Ostro (JPL). The data allowed Hudson et al. to produce a three-dimensional model of the object. During the 1989 passage Castalia peaked at an apparent magnitude of 12.\nCastalia has a peanut shape, suggesting two approximately 800-meter-diameter pieces held together by their weak mutual gravity. Since then radar observations of other asteroids have found other contact binaries.\nCastalia is a potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA) because its minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) is less than 0.05\u00a0AU and its diameter is greater than 150 meters. The Earth-MOID is . Its orbit is well-determined for the next several hundred years.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The story of her abduction by Zeus in the form of a bull was a Cretan story.\nAn early reference to Europa is in a fragment of the Hesiodic \"Catalogue of Women\", discovered at Oxyrhynchus. The earliest vase-painting securely identifiable as Europa dates from the mid-7th century BC.\nEtymology.\nGreek (\"Eur\u1e53p\u0113\") may have been formed from ('), \"wide, broad\" and (): \"eye, face, countenance\". \"Broad\" has been an epithet of Earth herself in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion.\nIt is common in ancient Greek mythology and geography to identify lands or rivers with female figures. Thus, \"Europa\" is first used in a geographic context in the Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo, in reference to the western shore of the Aegean Sea.\nAs a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BC by Anaximander and Hecataeus. Toponyms related to that of Europa exist in the territory of ancient Greece, such as that of Europos in ancient Macedonia, as collected by Robert Beekes.\nIn 1966, an alternative suggestion from Ernest Klein and Giovanni Semerano attempted to connect a Semitic term for \"west\", Akkadian \"erebu\" meaning \"to go down, set\" (in reference to the sun), Phoenician \" \"' \"evening; west\", which would parallel \"occident\". The resemblance to \"Erebus\", from PIE \"*h1reg\u02b7os\", \"darkness\", is accidental. In 1999, M.A. Barry adduced the word \"Ereb\" on an Assyrian stele with the meaning of \"night\", \"[the country of] sunset\", in opposition to \"Asu\", \"[the country of] sunrise\", i.e. Asia, Anatolia coming equally from , \"(sun)rise\", \"east\". This proposal is mostly considered unlikely or untenable.\nFamily.\nSources differ in details regarding Europa's family, but agree that she is Phoenician, and from an Argive lineage that ultimately descended from the princess Io, the mythical nymph beloved of Zeus, who was transformed into a heifer. She is generally said to be the daughter of Agenor, the Phoenician King of Tyre. The Syracusan poet Moschus makes her mother Queen Telephassa (\"far-shining\"). Elsewhere, her mother is Argiope (\"silver-faced\").\nOther sources, such as the \"Iliad\", claim that she is the daughter of Agenor's son, the \"sun-red\" Phoenix. It is generally agreed that she had two brothers, Cadmus, who brought the alphabet to mainland Greece, and Cilix who gave his name to Cilicia in Asia Minor. The author of \"Bibliotheke\" includes Phoenix as a third brother. So some interpret this as her brother Phoenix (when he is assumed to be son of Agenor) gave his siblings' name to his three children and this Europa (by this case, niece of former) is also loved by Zeus, but because of the same name, gave some confusions to others.\nAfter arriving in Crete, Europa had three sons fathered by Zeus: Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Sarpedon. Minos and Rhadamanthus became judges of the Underworld, alongside Aeacus of Aegina, when they died. In Crete she married Asterion, also rendered Asterius, and became mother, or step-mother, of his daughter Crete. Pausanias wrote that the poet Praxilla makes Carnus a son of Europa.\nMythology.\nThe \"Dictionary of Classical Mythology\" explains that Zeus was enamoured with Europa and decided to seduce or rape her, the two being near-equivalent in Greek myth. He transformed himself into a tame white bull and mixed in with her father's herds. While Europa and her helpers were gathering flowers, she saw the bull, caressed his flanks, and eventually got onto his back. Zeus took that opportunity and ran to the sea and swam, with her on his back, to the island of Crete.\nZeus then revealed his true identity, and Europa became the first queen of Crete. Zeus gave her a necklace made by Hephaestus and three additional gifts: the bronze automaton guard Talos, the hound Laelaps who never failed to catch his quarry, and a javelin that never missed. Zeus later re-created the shape of the white bull in the stars, which is now known as the constellation Taurus. It should not be confused with the Cretan Bull that fathered the Minotaur and was captured by Heracles. Roman mythology adopted the tale of the \"Raptus\", also known as \"The Abduction of Europa\" and \"The Seduction of Europa\", substituting the god Jupiter for Zeus.\nThe myth of Europa and Zeus may have its origin in a sacred union between the Phoenician deities 'A\u0161tar and 'A\u0161tart (Astarte), in bovine form. Having given birth to three sons by Zeus, Europa married a king Asterion, this being also the name of the Minotaur and an epithet of Zeus, likely derived from the name \"'A\u0161tar\".\nAccording to Herodotus's rationalizing approach, Europa was kidnapped by Greeks, probably Cretans, who were seeking to avenge the kidnapping of Io, a princess from Argos. His variant story may have been an attempt to rationalize the earlier myth. Or, the present myth may be a garbled version of facts\u2014the abduction of a Phoenician aristocrat\u2014later enunciated without gloss by Herodotus.\nCult.\nAstarte and Europa.\nIn the territory of Phoenician Sidon, Lucian of Samosata (2nd century AD) was informed that the temple of Astarte, whom Lucian equated with the moon goddess, was sacred to Europa:\n There is likewise in Ph\u0153nicia a temple of great size owned by the Sidonians. They call it the temple of Astarte. I hold this Astarte to be no other than the moon-goddess. But according to the story of one of the priests this temple is sacred to Europa, the sister of Cadmus. She was the daughter of Agenor, and on her disappearance from Earth the Ph\u0153nicians honoured her with a temple and told a sacred legend about her; how that Zeus was enamoured of her for her beauty, and changing his form into that of a bull carried her off into Crete. This legend I heard from other Ph\u0153nicians as well; and the coinage current among the Sidonians bears upon it the effigy of Europa sitting upon a bull, none other than Zeus. Thus they do not agree that the temple in question is sacred to Europa. \nThe paradox, as it seemed to Lucian, would be solved if Europa \"is\" Astarte in her guise as the full, \"broad-faced\" moon.\nInterpretation.\nThere were two competing myths relating how Europa came into the Hellenic world, but they agreed that she came to Crete (Kr\u00edti), where the sacred bull was paramount. In the more familiar telling she was seduced by the god Zeus in the form of a bull, who breathed from his mouth a saffron crocus and carried her away to Crete on his back\u2014to be welcomed by Asterion, According to the more literal, euhemerist version that begins the account of Persian-Hellene confrontations of Herodotus, she was kidnapped by Cretans, who likewise were said to have taken her to Crete.\nThe mythical Europa cannot be separated from the mythology of the sacred bull, which had been worshipped in the Levant. In 2012, an archaeological mission of the British Museum led by Lebanese archaeologist, Claude Doumet-Serhal, discovered at the site of the old American school in Sidon, Lebanon, currency that depicts Europa riding the bull with her veil flying all over like a bow, further proof of Europa's Phoenician origin.\nEuropa does not seem to have been venerated directly in cult anywhere in classical Greece, but at Lebadaea in Boeotia, Pausanias noted in the 2nd century AD, that \"Europa\" was the epithet of Demeter\u2014\"Demeter whom they surname Europa and say was the nurse of Trophonios\"\u2014among the Olympians who were addressed by seekers at the cave sanctuary of Trophonios of Orchomenus, to whom a chthonic cult and oracle were dedicated: \"the grove of Trophonios by the river Herkyna\nThe festival of Hellotia in Crete was celebrated in honour of Europa.\nIn art and literature.\n\"Europa\" provided the substance of a brief Hellenistic epic written in the mid-2nd century BCE by Moschus, a bucolic poet and friend of the Alexandrian grammarian Aristarchus of Samothrace, born at Syracuse.\nIn \"Metamorphoses\" Book II, the poet Ovid wrote the following depiction of Jupiter's seduction:\nHis picturesque details belong to anecdote and fable: in all the depictions, whether she straddles the bull, as in archaic vase-paintings or the ruined metope fragment from Sikyon, or sits gracefully sidesaddle as in a mosaic from North Africa, there is no trace of fear. Often Europa steadies herself by touching one of the bull's horns, acquiescing.\nHer tale is also mentioned in Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"Tanglewood Tales\". Though his story titled \"Dragon's teeth\" is largely about Cadmus, it begins with an elaborate albeit toned down version of Europa's abduction by the beautiful bull.\nThe tale also features as the subject of a poem and film in the Enderby (fictional character) sequence of novels by Anthony Burgess. She is remembered in \"De Mulieribus Claris\", a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 1361\u201362. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature.\nNamesakes.\nContinent.\nThe name Europe, as a geographical term, was used by Ancient Greek geographers such as Strabo to refer to part of Thrace below the Balkan Mountains. Later, under the Roman Empire the name was given to a Thracian province. Thrace or Thraike in Greek mythology, was the sister of a water nymph named Europa. Europa was also a surname given to the earth mother goddess Demeter.\nIt is derived from the Greek word \"Eur\u014dp\u0113\" () in all Romance languages, Germanic languages, Slavic languages, Baltic languages, Celtic languages, Iranian languages, Uralic languages (Hungarian Eur\u00f3pa, Finnish Eurooppa, Estonian Euroopa).\nJ\u00fcrgen Fischer, in \"Oriens-Occidens-Europa\" summarized how the name came into use, supplanting the \"oriens\"\u2013\"occidens\" dichotomy of the later Roman Empire, which was expressive of a divided empire, Latin in the West, Greek in the East.\nIn the 8th century, ecclesiastical uses of \"Europa\" for the imperium of Charlemagne provide the source for the modern geographical term. The first use of the term \"\", to describe peoples of the Christian, western portion of the continent, appeared in the Hispanic Latin Chronicle of 754, sometimes attributed to an author called Isidore Pacensis in reference to the Battle of Tours fought against Muslim forces.\nThe European Union has used Europa as a symbol of pan-Europeanism, by naming its web portal after her and depicting her on the Greek \u20ac2 coin and on several gold and silver commemorative coins, e.g. the Belgian \u20ac10 European Expansion coin. Her name appeared on postage stamps celebrating the Council of Europe, which were first issued in 1956. The second series of euro banknotes is known as the Europa Series and bears her likeness in the watermark and hologram.\nChemical element.\nThe metal \"europium\", a rare-earth element, was named in 1901 after the continent.\nMoon of Jupiter.\nThe invention of the telescope revealed that the planet Jupiter, clearly visible to the naked eye and known to humanity since prehistoric times, has an attendant family of moons. These were named for male and female lovers of the god and other mythological persons associated with him. The smallest of Jupiter's Galilean moons was named after Europa.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"Metamorphoses\", ii.833-iii.2, vi.103\u2013107"}

It is an asteroid that, relative to Earth, orbits the Sun in a bean-shaped orbit that effectively describes a horseshoe, and that can change into a quasi-satellite orbit. Cruithne does not orbit Earth and at times it is on the other side of the Sun, placing Cruithne well outside of Earth's Hill sphere. Its orbit takes it near the orbit of Mercury and outside the orbit of Mars. Cruithne orbits the Sun in about one Earth year, but it takes 770 years for the series to complete a horseshoe-shaped movement around Earth.\nThe asteroid takes its name from the Cruithne, a people mentioned in early Irish annals.\nDiscovery.\nCruithne was discovered on 10 October 1986 by Duncan Waldron on a photographic plate taken with the UK Schmidt Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory, Coonabarabran, Australia. A 1983 precovery (1983 UH) is credited to Giovanni de Sanctis and Richard M. West of the European Southern Observatory in Chile.\nIt was not until 1997 that its unusual orbit was determined by Paul Wiegert and Kimmo Innanen, working at York University in Toronto, and Seppo Mikkola, working at the University of Turku in Finland.\nDimensions and orbit.\nCruithne is approximately in diameter, and its closest approach to Earth is , approximately thirty times the separation between Earth and the Moon. From 1994 through 2015, Cruithne made its annual closest approach to Earth every November.\nAlthough Cruithne's orbit is not thought to be stable over the long term, calculations by Wiegert and Innanen showed that it has probably been synchronized with Earth's orbit for a long time. There is no danger of a collision with Earth for millions of years, if ever. Its orbital path and Earth's do not cross, and its orbital plane is currently tilted to that of Earth by 19.8\u00b0. Cruithne, having a maximum near-Earth magnitude of +15.8, is fainter than Pluto and would require at least a reflecting telescope to be seen.\nCruithne is in a normal elliptic orbit around the Sun. Its period of revolution around the Sun, approximately 364 days in the early 21st century, is almost equal to that of Earth. Because of this, Cruithne and Earth appear to \"follow\" each other in their paths around the Sun. This is why Cruithne is sometimes called \"Earth's second moon\". However, it does not orbit Earth and is not a moon. In 2058, Cruithne will come within 0.09\u00a0AU () of Mars.\nDue to a high orbital eccentricity, Cruithne's distance from the Sun and orbital speed vary a lot more than Earth's, so from Earth's point of view Cruithne actually follows a kidney-bean-shaped horseshoe orbit ahead of Earth, taking slightly less than one year to complete a circuit of the \"bean\". Because it takes slightly less than a year, Earth \"falls behind\" the bean a little more each year, and so, from the point of view of an observer on Earth, the circuit is not quite closed, but rather like a spiral loop that moves slowly away from Earth.\nAfter many years, Earth will have fallen so far behind that Cruithne will then actually be \"catching up\" on Earth from \"behind\". When it eventually does catch up, Cruithne will make a series of annual close approaches to Earth and gravitationally exchange orbital energy with Earth; this will alter Cruithne's orbit by a little over half a million kilometres\u2014while Earth's orbit is altered by about \u2014so that its period of revolution around the Sun will then become slightly more than a year. The kidney bean will then start to migrate away from Earth again in the opposite direction\u2014instead of Earth \"falling behind\" the bean, it is \"pulling away from\" the bean. The next such series of close approaches will be centred on the year 2292\u2014in July of that year, Cruithne will approach Earth to about .\nAfter 380 to 390 years or so, the kidney-bean-shaped orbit approaches Earth again from the other side, and Earth, once more, alters the orbit of Cruithne so that its period of revolution around the Sun is again slightly less than a year (this last happened with a series of close approaches centered on 1902, and will next happen with a series centered on 2676). The pattern then repeats itself.\nSimilar minor planets.\nMore near-resonant near-Earth objects (NEOs) have since been discovered. These include 54509 YORP, , , and 2009 BD which exist in resonant orbits similar to Cruithne's. is the first identified Earth trojan (out of only two known ).\nOther examples of natural bodies known to be in horseshoe orbits (with respect to each other) include Janus and Epimetheus, natural satellites of Saturn. The orbits these two moons follow around Saturn are much simpler than the one Cruithne follows, but operate along the same general principles.\nMars has four known co-orbital asteroids (5261 Eureka, , , and , all at the Lagrangian points), and Jupiter has many (an estimated one million greater than 1\u00a0km in diameter, the Jovian trojans); there are also other small co-orbital moons in the Saturnian system: Telesto and Calypso with Tethys, and Helene and Polydeuces with Dione. However, none of these follow horseshoe orbits.\nIn popular culture.\nCruithne plays a major role in Stephen Baxter's novel \"\", which was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award for best science fiction in 2000.\nCruithne is mentioned on the \"QI\" series A episode \"Astronomy\", in which it is described as a second moon of Earth. In a later episode (\"Knowledge\" in series K), it was added that, if we use the same definition, Earth has over 18,000 \"mini-moons\".\nIn \"Astonishing X-Men\", Cruithne is the site of a secret lab assaulted by Abigail Brand and her S.W.O.R.D. team. It contains many Brood before Brand destroys it.\nIn the Insignia trilogy, 3753 Cruithne has been moved into an orbit around Earth to serve as a training ground for the Intrasolar Forces. In the third novel, \"Catalyst\", it is intentionally directed at Earth. While it is destroyed before impact, its fragments rain down on Earth's surface, killing nearly 800 million people across the world.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Discovered by French astronomer Christian Pollas at Caussols in 1989, the asteroid was named after Toutatis from Celtic mythology.\nToutatis is also a Mars-crosser asteroid with a chaotic orbit produced by a 3:1 resonance with the planet Jupiter, a 1:4 resonance with the planet Earth, and frequent close approaches to the terrestrial planets, including Earth. In December 2012, Toutatis passed within about 18 lunar distances of Earth. The Chinese lunar probe Chang'e 2 flew by the asteroid at a distance of 3.2\u00a0kilometers and a relative velocity of 10.73\u00a0km/s. Toutatis approached Earth again in 2016, but will not make another notably close approach until 2069.\nProperties.\nToutatis was first sighted on 10 February 1934, as object 1934 CT, but lost soon afterwards. It remained a lost asteroid for several decades until it was rediscovered on 4 January 1989 by French astronomer Christian Pollas, and was named after the Celtic god of tribal protection Toutatis (Teutates). The name of this god is very familiar in France due to the catchphrase \"Par Toutatis!\" by the Gauls in the comics Asterix.\nThe spectral properties suggest that this is an S-type, or stony asteroid, consisting primarily of silicates. It has a moderate Bond albedo of 0.13. Radar imagery shows that Toutatis is a highly irregular body consisting of two distinct lobes, with maximum widths of about 4.6\u00a0km and 2.4\u00a0km, respectively. It is hypothesized that Toutatis formed from two originally separate bodies which coalesced at some point (a contact binary), with the resultant asteroid being compared to a rubble pile.\nIts rotation combines two separate periodic motions into a non-periodic result; to someone on the surface of Toutatis, the Sun would seem to rise and set in apparently random locations and at random times at the asteroid's horizon. It has a rotation period around its long axis (P\u03c8) of 5.38 days. This long axis is precessing with a period (P\u03c6) of 7.38 days. The asteroid may have lost most of its original angular momentum and entered into this tumbling motion as a result of the YORP effect.\nOrbit.\nWith a semimajor axis of 2.5294\u00a0AU, or roughly 2.5 times the distance between Earth and the Sun, Toutatis has a 3:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter and a near-1:4 resonance with Earth making it a member of the Alinda asteroid group. It thus completes one orbit around the Sun for every 4.02 annual orbits of Earth. The gravitational perturbations caused by frequent close approaches to the terrestrial planets lead to chaotic behavior in the orbit of Toutatis, making precise long-term predictions of its location progressively inaccurate over time. Estimates in 1993 put the Lyapunov time horizon for predictability at around 50 years, after which the uncertainty region becomes larger with each close approach to a planet. Without the perturbations from the terrestrial planets the Lyapunov time would be close to 10,000 years. The initial observations that showed its chaotic behavior were made by Wi\u015bniewski.\nThe low inclination (0.47\u00b0) of the orbit allows frequent transits, where the inner planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars can appear to cross the Sun as seen from the perspective of Toutatis. Earth did this in January 2009, July 2012, July 2016 and 2020.\nClose approaches and collision risk.\nToutatis makes frequent close approaches to Earth, with a currently minimum possible distance (Earth MOID) of just 0.006\u00a0AU (2.3 times as far as the Moon). The approach on 29 September 2004 was particularly close, at 0.0104\u00a0AU (within 4 lunar distances) from Earth, presenting a good opportunity for observation, with Toutatis having an apparent magnitude of 8.8 at its brightest. A close approach of happened on 9 November 2008. The most recent close approach was on 12 December 2012, at a distance of , with a magnitude of 10.7. At magnitude 10.7, Toutatis was not visible to the naked eye, but just visible to experienced observers using high-end binoculars. During the 2012 encounter Toutatis was recovered on 21 May 2012, by the Siding Spring Survey at apparent magnitude 18.9. A close approach will be 5 November 2069, at .\nGiven that Toutatis makes many close approaches to Earth, such as in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016, it is listed as a potentially hazardous object. With an uncertainty parameter of 0, the orbit of Toutatis is very well determined for the next few hundred years. The probability of the orbit intersecting Earth is essentially zero for at least the next six centuries. The likelihood of collision in the distant future is considered to be very small. As a planet-crossing asteroid, Toutatis is likely to be ejected from the inner Solar System within a few million years. In 2004 a chain e-mail falsely claimed that Toutatis had a 63% chance of impacting Earth then. In fact, Toutatis passed by at 1.5 million kilometres, or about four Earth\u2013Moon distances, as predicted.\nIn 2006 Toutatis came closer than 2\u00a0AU to Jupiter; its orbit lies inside of Jupiter's. In the 2100s, it will approach Jupiter many times at a similar distance.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;History of close approaches of large near-Earth objects since 1908\u2009(A)\nPhysical characteristics.\nLarge amounts of data of Toutatis were obtained during Chang'e 2's flyby. Toutatis is not a monolith, but most likely a coalescence of shattered fragments. This bifurcated asteroid is shown to be mainly consisting of a head (small lobe) and a body (large lobe). The two major parts are not round in shape, and their surfaces have a number of large facets. In comparison with radar models, the proximate observations from Chang'e 2's flyby have revealed several remarkable discoveries concerning Toutatis, among which the presence of the giant basin at the big end appears to be one of the most compelling geological features, and the sharply perpendicular silhouette in the neck region that connects the head and body is also quite novel. A large number of boulders and several short linear structures are also apparent on the surface.\nGiant basin.\nThe giant basin at the big end of Toutatis has a diameter of ~805\u00a0m, suggesting that one or more impactors may have collided with it there. The most significant feature is the ridge around the largest basin. The wall of this basin has a relatively high density of lineaments, some of which seem to be concentric to the basin. These ridges are indicative of an internal structure of small bodies and most of the ridges near the largest basin at the big end are most likely related to the huge stress energy during impact.\nObservation.\nToutatis has been observed with radar imaging from the Arecibo Observatory and the Goldstone Solar System Radar during the asteroid's prior Earth flybys in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2008. It was also observed with radar during the December 2012 flyby and observed more distant flyby with radar in December 2016. After 2016, Toutatis will not pass close to Earth again until 2069.\nResolution of the radar images is as fine as 3.75\u00a0m per pixel, providing data to model Toutatis's shape and spin state.\nExploration.\nThe Chinese lunar probe Chang'e 2 departed from the Sun\u2013Earth L2 point in April 2012 and made a flyby of Toutatis on 13 December 2012, with closest approach being 3.2\u00a0kilometers and a relative velocity of 10.73\u00a0km/s, when Toutatis was near its closest approach to Earth. It took several pictures of the asteroid, revealing it to be a dusty red/orange color.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

An Argive princess, she was an ancestor of many kings and heroes, such as Perseus, Cadmus, Heracles, Minos, Lynceus, Cepheus, and Danaus. The astronomer Simon Marius named a moon of Jupiter after Io in 1614.\nBecause her brother was Phoroneus, Io is also known as Phoronis (an adjective form of Phoroneus: \"Phoronean\"). She was sometimes compared to the Egyptian goddess Isis, whereas her Egyptian husband Telegonus was Osiris.\nFamily.\nIn most versions of the legend, Io was the daughter of Inachus, though various other purported genealogies are also known. If her father was Inachus, then her mother would presumably have been Inachus' wife (and sister), the Oceanid nymph Melia, daughter of Oceanus.\nShe had the patronymic Inachis (\u1f38\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03af\u03c2) as daughter of Inachus.\nIo's father was called Peiren in the \"Catalogue of Women\", and by Acusilaus, possibly a son of the elder Argus, also known as Peiras, Peiranthus or Peirasus. Io may therefore be identical to Callithyia, daughter of Peiranthus, as is suggested by Hesychius of Alexandria.\nThe 2nd century AD geographer Pausanias mentions another, later Io, descendant of Phoroneus, daughter of Iasus, who himself was the son of Argus and Ismene, the daughter of Asopus, or of Triopas and Sosis; Io's mother in the latter case was Leucane.\nMythology.\nIo and Zeus.\nIo was a priestess of the goddess Hera in Argos, whose cult her father Inachus was supposed to have introduced to Argos. Zeus noticed Io, a mortal woman, and lusted after her. In the version of the myth told in \"Prometheus Bound\" she initially rejected Zeus' advances, until her father threw her out of his house on the advice of oracles. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, Zeus pursues a fleeing Io through the Lycrean country, throwing a mantle of darkness over the earth, and then raped her. According to some stories, Zeus then turned Io into a heifer in order to hide her from his wife; others maintain that Hera herself transformed Io.\nIn the version of the story in which Zeus transformed Io, the deception failed, and Hera begged Zeus to give her the heifer as a present, which, having no reason to refuse, he did. Pitying the unfortunate girl, Gaia, the goddess of the earth, created the violet (), so the cow could eat, thus growing \"from her from whom it has its name\", based on incorrect folk etymology. The various colours of the violet (red, purple, white) changed on account of Io's life, red for the blushing maiden, purple for the cow, white for the stars. Hera then sent Argus Panoptes, a giant who had 100 eyes, to watch Io and prevent Zeus from visiting her, and so Zeus sent Hermes to distract and eventually slay Argus. According to Ovid, he did so by first lulling him to sleep by playing the panpipes and telling stories. Zeus freed Io, still in the form of a heifer. In some myths, Hera uses Argus' eyes to decorate her peacock's feathers to thank the giant for his help.\nIn order to exact her revenge, Hera sent a gadfly to sting Io continuously, driving her to wander the world without rest. Io eventually crossed the path between the Propontis and the Black Sea, which thus acquired the name Bosporus (meaning \"ox passage\"), where she met Prometheus, who had been chained on Mt. Caucasus by Zeus. Prometheus comforted Io with the information that she would be restored to human form and become the ancestress of the greatest of all heroes, Heracles (Hercules). Io escaped across the Ionian Sea to Egypt, where she was restored to human form by Zeus. There, she gave birth to Zeus's son Epaphus, and a daughter as well, Keroessa. She later married Egyptian king Telegonus. Their grandson, Danaus, eventually returned to Greece with his fifty daughters (the Danaids), as recalled in Aeschylus' play \"The Suppliants\".\nThe myth of Io must have been well known to Homer, who often calls Hermes \"Argeiphontes\", which is often translated as \"Argus-slayer\", though this interpretation is disputed by Robert Beekes. Walter Burkert notes that the story of Io was told in the ancient epic tradition at least four times of which we have traces: in the \"Danais\", in the \"Phoronis\"\u2014Phoroneus founded the cult of Hera, according to Hyginus' \"Fabulae\" 274 and 143\u2014in a fragment of the Hesiodic \"Aigimios\", as well as in similarly fragmentary Hesiodic \"Catalogue of Women\". A mourning commemoration of Io was observed at the Heraion of Argos into classical times.\nThe ancients connected Io with the Moon, and in Aeschylus' \"Prometheus Bound\", where Io encounters Prometheus, she refers to herself as \"the horned virgin\". From her relationship with Phoroneus, as sister (or descendant), Io is sometimes called Phoronis.\nAccording to the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology by William Smith, Io at some point landed at Damalis, and the Chalcedonians erected a bronze cow on the spot.\nIo as Isis.\nLygdus and his wife, Telethusa, were a poor couple living in Crete. When Telethusa becomes pregnant, her husband tells her that they cannot afford to have a daughter, and that they have no other option than to kill the child if it is a daughter. Eight months later Io, later in the story mentioned as Isis, comes in a vision to Telethusa telling her that she should keep her daughter when it is born and must tell her husband that it is a boy named Iphis.\nLater in the story, Isis (Io) changes Iphis' sex when she is supposed to marry her fianc\u00e9e, Ianthe.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has a relatively elliptical orbit that requires more than four years to circle the Sun. This tumbling asteroid has an unusually slow rate of rotation, requiring 17.4 days to complete a 360\u00b0 revolution about its axis. It is a primitive C-type asteroid, which means the surface has a high proportion of carbon; giving it a dark surface that reflects only 4% of the light that falls on it.\nMathilde was visited by the NEAR\u00a0Shoemaker spacecraft during June 1997, on its way to asteroid 433\u00a0Eros. During the short flyby, the spacecraft imaged a hemisphere of the asteroid, revealing many large craters that had gouged out depressions in the surface. It was the first carbonaceous asteroid to be explored and, until 21\u00a0Lutetia was visited in 2010, it was the largest asteroid to be visited by a spacecraft.\nObservation history.\nIn 1880, Johann Palisa, the director of the Austrian Naval Observatory (538), was offered a position as an assistant at the newly completed Vienna Observatory. Although the job represented a demotion for Johann, it gave him access to the new refractor, the largest telescope in the world at that time. By this point Johann had already discovered 27 asteroids, and he would employ the Vienna and instruments to find an additional 94 asteroids before he retired.\nAmong his discoveries was the asteroid 253 Mathilde, found on 12 November 1885. The initial orbital elements of the asteroid were then computed by V. A. Lebeuf, another Austrian astronomer working at the Paris Observatory. The name of the asteroid was suggested by Lebeuf, after Mathilde, the wife of Moritz Loewy\u2014who was the vice director of the observatory in Paris.\nIn 1995, ground-based observations determined that Mathilde is a C-type asteroid. It was also found to have an unusually long period of rotation of 418 hours.\nOn 27 June 1997, the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft passed within 1,212\u00a0km of Mathilde while moving at a velocity of 9.93\u00a0km/s. This close approach allowed the spacecraft to capture over 500 images of the surface, and provided data for more accurate determinations of the asteroid's dimensions and mass (based on gravitational perturbation of the spacecraft). However, only one hemisphere of Mathilde was imaged during the fly-by. This was only the third asteroid to be imaged from a nearby distance, following 951 Gaspra and 243 Ida.\nCharacteristics.\nMathilde is very dark, with an albedo comparable to fresh asphalt, and is thought to share the same composition as CI1 or CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, with a surface dominated by phyllosilicate minerals. The asteroid has a number of extremely large craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two largest craters, Ishikari (29.3\u00a0km) and Karoo (33.4\u00a0km), are as wide as the asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have spalled large volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters. Uniformity in brightness and colour were visible in the craters and there was no appearance of layering, so the asteroid's interior must be very homogeneous. There are indications of material movement along the downslope direction.\nThe density measured by NEAR Shoemaker, 1,300\u00a0kg/m3, is less than half that of a typical carbonaceous chondrite; this may indicate that the asteroid is very loosely packed rubble pile. The same is true of several C-type asteroids studied by ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics systems (45 Eugenia, 90 Antiope, 87 Sylvia and 121 Hermione). Up to 50% of the interior volume of Mathilde consists of open space. However, the existence of a 20-km-long scarp may indicate that the asteroid does have some structural strength, so it could contain some large internal components. The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through the asteroid, which also helps to preserve the surface features to a high degree.\nMathilde's orbit is eccentric, taking it to the outer reaches of the belt. Nonetheless, the orbit lies entirely between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter; it does not cross the planetary orbits. It also has one of the slowest rotation periods of the known asteroids\u2014most asteroids have a rotation period in the range of 2\u201324 hours. Because of the slow rotation rate, NEAR Shoemaker was only able to photograph 60% of the asteroid's surface. The slow rate of rotation may be accounted for by a satellite orbiting the asteroid, but a search of the NEAR images revealed none larger than 10\u00a0km in diameter out to 20 times the radius of Mathilde.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has a mean diameter of approximately and contains about one percent of the cumulative mass of the whole asteroid belt. It was thought to be the exposed core of a protoplanet, but recent observations cast doubt on that hypothesis. \nPsyche will be explored by NASA, with a spacecraft of the same name, marking the first time a manmade object will journey to a metallic asteroid. The spacecraft was launched on 13\u00a0October 2023, with an expected arrival in 2029.\nSymbol.\nAstronomers created icon-like symbols for the first nineteen asteroids to be discovered, as a type of shorthand notation consistent with older notation for the classical planets. Psyche was given an iconic symbol, as were a few other asteroids discovered after 16\u00a0Psyche. The symbol was a butterfly's wing topped by a star ( or ), as the butterfly was a Greek symbol of the soul (\"psyche\" being the Greek word for both \"butterfly\" and \"soul\"). This symbol may have influenced the design of the official insignia for the NASA \"Psyche\" mission to this asteroid. It was encoded in Unicode 17.0 as U+1CEC9 \ud833\udec9 ().\nHowever, the iconic symbols for all asteroids were superseded before Psyche's symbol ever came into use. With more than a dozen asteroids discovered, remembering all their individual emblems became increasingly cumbersome, and, in 1851, German astronomer J.F. Encke suggested using a circled number instead: \u246f. The first asteroid designated with the new scheme was , when American astronomer J. Ferguson published his observations in 1852.\nCharacteristics.\nSize.\nThe first size estimate of Psyche was and came from IRAS thermal infrared emission observations. This is 15% larger than the currently accepted mean value, but was later found to be an accurate estimate for the IRAS viewing aspect because Psyche was viewed pole-on at the time of the measurement.\nPsyche has been observed to occult a star on nine occasions. Four of these, 2004, 2010, 2014, and 2019, generated multi-chord data sets and have been used along with adaptive optics imaging and three-dimensional modeling to estimate Psyche's mean diameter, with recent models all converging to an equivalent-volume mean diameter of \u00a0km.\nMass and bulk density.\nPsyche is massive enough that its gravity observably perturbs other asteroids' orbits, which can be used to calculate a mass estimate. Historical values for Psyche's mass have ranged from to . However, most recent estimates have begun to converge on values near . Assuming the mean volume of , this equates to a bulk density of , which is considerably higher than most small Solar System bodies.\nShape and spin pole.\nThe first published three-dimensional shape model for Psyche was derived from an analysis of numerous \nlight curves. Since then, additional refinements to the shape have been made based on the inversion of lightcurves, adaptive optics observations, radar observations, thermal imaging, and occultations. The most recent models show that Psyche has a shape consistent with a Jacobi ellipsoid and dimensions within a few km of 278\u00a0km x 238\u00a0km x 171\u00a0km.\nEach shape model provides an estimate of the direction of the north pole (spin axis). All recent models for Psyche suggest it rotates about a pole pointed towards the ecliptic coordinates (long, lat) \"\u03bb\" \n 35\u00b0, \"\u03b2\" \n \u22128\u00b0, with a 3\u00b0 uncertainty. This means that it is essentially tilted toward the ecliptic, with an axial tilt of 98\u00b0.\nFeatures.\nMany features have been reported on Psyche. The largest of these are regions of mass-deficits relative to its nominal ellipsoid shape and are reminiscent of the Rheasilvia basin on 4 Vesta.\nIn addition to the large-scale regions of mass-deficit, several apparent craters have been reported. Observers using the Very Large Telescope's adaptive optics SPHERE imager reported two large craters, on the order of 90\u00a0km across, which were provisionally named Meroe and Panthia , after the twin witches in the Roman novel \"Metamorphoses\" by Apuleius. Observers using the Arecibo Radar Telescope reported craters at the south pole (referred to as Delta), southern midlatitudes (referred to as Eros), and the north pole (referred to as Foxtrot). An analysis of the features present in several independent shape models suggests that craters Panthia and Eros are almost certainly real and Foxtrot is likely to be real. However, there is uncertainty over the existence of Meroe and Delta.\nEarly lightcurve studies suggested that Psyche has large variations in its surface brightness. These variations became more evident when attempts were made to invert lightcurves to generate shape models. The most recent shape models based on lightcurve inversions simultaneously solve for surface albedo variations, and the resulting maps show regions where local albedo differs from the mean albedo by more than 20% in either direction. Notably, the Meroe crater coincides with an area much darker than the mean, and the Panthia crater coincides with an area much brighter than the mean.\nRadar observations with the Arecibo Radar Telescope revealed that Psyche's \"background\" radar albedo is formula_1, comparable to other M-type asteroids like 21 Lutetia. This value is consistent with a silicate (rocky) regolith enriched in metal phases. However, in at least three locations, Psyche's radar albedo is nearly twice this value, suggesting high concentrations of metal phases in these regions. One of these locations corresponds with the optically bright Panthia crater, while the other two correspond with regions that have been reported as optically bright. This apparent correlation between optical and radar albedos on Psyche has led to the hypothesis that there is a link between the process(es) that create regions of high metal content and brighter terrain.\nComposition.\nThe bulk density of Psyche () places constraints on its overall composition. The iron-nickel found in most iron meteorites has a bulk density of . If Psyche were the remnant core of an early planetesimal, it would have to have an overall porosity of 50%. Given Psyche's size, this is considered highly improbable. However, there are other metal-rich meteorite types that have been suggested as Psyche analogs, each of which have bulk densities that are similar to Psyche's, including enstatite chondrites, bencubbinites, and mesosiderites.\nSeveral observers have reported the presence of silicate minerals on the surface of Psyche. Spectra taken in October\u00a02016 at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility at the Mauna Kea Observatories showed evidence (~3\u00a0\u03bcm absorption feature) of hydroxyl ions on the asteroid that may suggest the presence of hydrated silicates. Since Psyche is thought to have formed under dry conditions without the presence of water, the hydroxyl may have reached Psyche via past impacts from smaller carbonaceous asteroids.\nPsyche's radar albedo varies considerably over the surface, ranging from 0.22 to 0.52, values that are two to four times as high as most main-belt asteroids. Models of radar reflection equate this range of values with regolith bulk densities of 2.6 to 4.7 . This range is consistent with most of the metal-rich meteorite classes noted above and the spectroscopic detection of silicate minerals. It is inconsistent with a pure iron-nickel regolith unless it is highly porous.\nOrigin.\nSeveral possible origins have been proposed for Psyche. The earliest of these was that Psyche is an exposed metallic core resulting from a collision that stripped away the crust and mantle of an originally larger differentiated parent body some 500\u00a0kilometers in diameter. Other versions of this include the idea that it was not the result of a single large collision but multiple (more than three) relatively slow sideswipe collisions with bodies of comparable or larger size. However, this idea has fallen out of recent favor as mass and density estimates are inconsistent with a remnant core.\nA second hypothesis is that Psyche was disrupted and gravitationally re-accreted into a mix of metal and silicate. In this case, it may be a candidate for the parent body of the mesosiderites, a class of stony\u2013iron meteorites.\nA third hypothesis is that Psyche may be a differentiated object, like 1 Ceres and 4 Vesta, but has experienced a type of iron volcanism, also known as ferrovolcanism, while still cooling. If true, this model predicts that metal would be highly enriched only in those regions containing (relic) volcanic centers. This view has been bolstered by recent radar observations.\nExploration.\nNo spacecraft has visited Psyche, but a mission to Psyche was proposed to NASA in 2014. A team led by Lindy Elkins-Tanton, the director of the School for Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, presented a concept for a robotic \"Psyche\" orbiter. This team argued that 16 Psyche would be a valuable object for study because it is the only metallic core-like body discovered so far.\nThe spacecraft would orbit Psyche for 20\u00a0months, studying its topography, surface features, gravity, magnetism, and other characteristics and would be based on current technology, avoiding high cost and the necessity to develop new technologies. On 30\u00a0September 2015, the \"Psyche\" orbiter mission was one of five Discovery Program semifinalist proposals.\nThe mission was approved by NASA on 4\u00a0January 2017 and was originally targeted to launch in October\u00a02023, with an Earth gravity assist maneuver in 2024, a Mars flyby in 2025, and arriving at the asteroid in 2030. In May\u00a02017, the launch date was moved up to target a more efficient trajectory, launching in 2022, with a Mars gravity assist in 2023 and arriving in 2026. However, problems with Psyche's flight software led NASA to revert to the original launch timeline.\nOn 28\u00a0February 2020, NASA awarded SpaceX a US$117\u00a0million contract to launch the \"Psyche\" spacecraft, and two smallsat secondary missions, on a Falcon Heavy rocket. The spacecraft was successfully launched on 13 October 2023, at 14:19 UTC, with an expected arrival in 2029.\nAsteroid Psyche has an Earth-MOID of , and most recently came to opposition on 6 August 2024 when it was from Earth.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are centered on singer Darrin Huss, who has been the only constant member, with various line-ups including his brother Stephen Huss, later followed by David Kristian, Per-Anders Kurenbach, and Remi Szyszka, all recording albums with Darrin under the name Psyche.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nPsyche was formed by brothers Darrin and Stephen Huss in Edmonton, Alberta, named after the B-Side of Killing Joke's \"Wardance\" single as well as being chosen for the meaning of the word. The band's debut performance was on December 13, 1982, with Dwayne Goettel on additional keyboards.\nDuring this period, Psyche performed bizarre live shows wherein Darrin performed nude (except for being covered in shaving cream) while talk-singing and shouting over the music. The performance idea was prompted by pictures seen of Fad Gadget in British Music magazines.\nWhile demos were recorded during the collaboration with Dwayne Goettel, no albums were released until 1985's \"Insomnia Theatre\", after Goettel's departure.\nEarly years.\nAfter \"Insomnia Theatre\" achieved moderate success in Europe, Psyche signed with New Rose Records in Paris. They released two singles followed by a studio album, \"Unveiling the Secret\", in 1986. To promote the record, Psyche performed as the opening act for Suicide, at \u00c9lys\u00e9e Montmartre in Paris, then as headliners on their own European tour.\nAfter the release of their third studio album, \"Mystery Hotel\", Stephen Huss was diagnosed with schizophrenia and took a hiatus from the group. During this period Darrin began collaborating with David Kristian, leading to a new album, \"The Influence\", in 1989. This album introduced new elements to Psyche's sound, with samples created by Kristian, and being performed entirely on the Casio FZ1. The songs \"Misery\", and \"Haunted\" began Psyche's shift to the dark wave music scene.\nA visit home to Waterloo in 1991 reunited the Huss brothers and, the subsequent recording sessions produced 1991's \"Daydream Avenue\". Though Psyche returned to tour Europe with German keyboardist Johannes Haeusler in support of English poetic artist Anne Clark, Stephen Huss stayed behind in Canada because of his illness.\nIn 1994, the album \"Intimacy\", produced in collaboration with Joseph Watt (of Razormaid) was released, along with a companion EP of dance numbers, \"Private Desires\", which featured a cover of Soft Cell's classic \"Sex Dwarf\". The group embarked on a small German tour, but Stephen Huss remained in Canada, leaving Darrin to find new collaborators in Germany.\nCrossover success.\nAfter another hiatus while Darrin took part in side projects, Psyche resumed activities in 1996 with Per-Anders Kurenbach joining as a new member. The first single release was \"You Ran Away\" with a cover version of \"Goodbye Horses\" by Q Lazzarus as the B-side. This cover version became a permanent staple in Psyche's live repertoire, as well as being included on the album \"Strange Romance\", which took a musical shift toward an accessible, upbeat pop sound.\nAfter playing for the first time in Oslo, Norway and a return to Sweden, Psyche released a live video featuring highlights from their \"Strange Romance\" Tour. In 1998 the group signed with the StrangeWays label out of Hamburg, Germany, and released their eighth album, \"Love Among the Ruined\", which included some experimental pop music.\nAt the beginning of 2000, Psyche signed to Artoffact Records of Toronto, Canada. The release of \"Misguided Angels\" contained material from 1983 through 2000 as a re-introduction of Psyche back on their original continent. It contained the last material from Per-Anders Kurenbach, and Darrin as well as some lesser-known mixes. By this point the partnership was dissolved, and Darrin began the next decade of music with Remi Szyszka as his collaborator in Psyche.\nThe new line-up made its debut on Accession Records with the single, \"Sanctuary\", released in April 2001. After a series of concerts in both Europe and North America, a ninth studio album \"The Hiding Place\" was released and well-received, charting at fourth place in the year-end Top 100 of the German Alternative Charts. To capitalize on this success, a remix album entitled \"Endangered Species\" was released mid-2002. A series of live performances followed in 2003, along with the release of \"Babylon Deluxe\", which appeared in the German Alternative Top Ten.\n\"The 11th Hour\", Psyche's 11th album, featured the return of previous collaborator Per-Anders Kurenbach, but including a farewell track with Remi Szyszka, and a guest appearance by Christian Wirsig. \"The 11th Hour\" was released through Accession Records in Europe, Metropolis Records in North America, and Irond Records in Russia making it the widest release in the band's history. The album topped the German Alternative Charts (DAC), ranking #1 for 7 weeks on the DAC Top 10 Albums of March, 2005. and Nr. 11 on the overall chart of that year.\nIn 2006, as the band neared its 25-year mark, a DVD collection documenting Psyche's appearances in every incarnation from 1983 to 2005 was released. Titled \"Imaginary Life\", its 23 tracks included at least one song from each of the previous albums released. It contains music videos and performances beginning with \"The Crawler\" on an Edmonton TV station in 1983 through to 2005, an audio commentary track, and a backstage interview with the Huss brothers in Sweden after their debut concert in Gothenburg in 1988.\nFollowing \"The 11th Hour\", Psyche shifted their focus to touring rather than recording, playing shows and festivals across Europe, North and South America, and South Africa. While no new studio albums were recorded, the band released remix albums (\"Unveiling the Secret 2.0\", \"Until The Shadows\", \"Halloween EP\"), compilations of old and unreleased materials (\"Re-Membering Dwayne\", \"Unknown Treasures\", \"As The Brain Collapses\", \"Rare Mixes &amp; B-Sides\"), several live albums, and some re-releases of early albums.\nIn 2011, Psyche releases a cover album, \"Unknown Treasures\", that includes re interpretations of songs by The Cure, The Doors, Depeche Mode or Visage. In 2012, they released the \"All Things Pass Into The Night\" EP which included a re-recorded extended version of \"Goodbye Horses\" on the Optimo Label.

{"id": "47242", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47242", "title": "Amalthea (moon)", "text": "Moon of Jupiter\nAmalthea () is a moon of Jupiter. It has the third-closest orbit around Jupiter among known moons and was the fifth moon of Jupiter to be discovered, so it is also known as Jupiter V. It is also the fifth-largest moon of Jupiter, after the four Galilean moons. Edward Emerson Barnard discovered the moon on 9 September 1892 and named it after Amalthea of Greek mythology. It was the last natural satellite to be discovered by direct visual observation; all later moons were discovered by photographic or digital imaging.\nAmalthea is in a close orbit around Jupiter and is within the outer edge of the Amalthea Gossamer Ring, which is formed from dust ejected from its surface. Jupiter would appear 46.5\u00a0degrees in diameter from its surface. Amalthea is the largest of the inner satellites of Jupiter and is irregularly shaped and reddish in color. It is thought to consist of porous water ice with unknown amounts of other materials. Its surface features include large craters and ridges.\nClose-range images of Amalthea were taken in 1979 by the \"Voyager 1\" and \"2\" spacecraft, and in more detail by the \"Galileo\" orbiter in the 1990s.\nHistory.\nDiscovery.\nAmalthea was discovered on 9 September 1892 by Edward Emerson Barnard using the 36 inch (91 cm) refractor telescope at Lick Observatory. It was the last planetary satellite to be discovered by direct visual observation (as opposed to photographically) and was the first new satellite of Jupiter since Galileo Galilei's discovery of the Galilean satellites in 1610.\nName.\nAmalthea is named after the nymph Amalthea from Greek mythology, who nursed the infant Zeus (the Greek equivalent of Jupiter) with goat's milk. Its Roman numeral designation is Jupiter\u00a0V. The name \"Amalthea\" was initially suggested by Camille Flammarion. It was not formally adopted by the IAU until 1976, although it had been in informal use for many decades. Before 1976, Amalthea was most commonly known simply as Jupiter V.\nOrbit.\nAmalthea orbits Jupiter at a distance of 181,000\u00a0km (2.54\u00a0Jupiter radii). The orbit of Amalthea has an eccentricity of 0.003 and an inclination of 0.37\u00b0 relative to the equator of Jupiter. Such appreciably nonzero values of inclination and eccentricity, though still small, are unusual for an inner satellite and can be explained by the influence of the innermost Galilean satellite, Io: in the past Amalthea has passed through several mean-motion resonances with Io that have excited its inclination and eccentricity (in a mean-motion resonance the ratio of orbital periods of two bodies is a rational number like \"m\":\"n\").\nAmalthea's orbit lies near the outer edge of the Amalthea Gossamer Ring, which is composed of dust ejected from the satellite.\nPhysical characteristics.\nThe surface of Amalthea is the reddest in the Solar System. This color may be due to sulfur originating from Io or some other non-ice material. Bright patches of less-red tint appear on the major slopes of Amalthea, but the nature of this color is currently unknown. The surface of Amalthea is slightly brighter than surfaces of other inner satellites of Jupiter. There is also a substantial asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3\u00a0times brighter than the trailing one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere, which excavates a bright material\u2014presumably ice\u2014from the interior of the moon.\nAmalthea is irregularly shaped, with the best ellipsoidal approximation being 250 \u00d7 146 \u00d7 128\u00a0km. From this, Amalthea's surface area is likely between 88,000 and 170,000\u00a0square kilometers, or somewhere near 130,000. Like all other inner moons of Jupiter, it is tidally locked with the planet, with the long axis pointing towards Jupiter at all times. Its surface is heavily scarred by craters, some of which are extremely large relative to the size of the moon: Pan, the largest crater, measures 100\u00a0km across and is at least 8\u00a0km deep. Another crater, Gaea, measures 80\u00a0km across and is likely twice as deep as Pan. Amalthea has several prominent bright spots, two of which are named. They are Lyctos Facula and Ida Facula, with a width reaching up to 25\u00a0km. They are located on the edge of ridges.\nAmalthea's irregular shape and large size led in the past to a conclusion that it is a fairly strong, rigid body, where it was argued that a body composed of ices or other weak materials would have been pulled into a more spherical shape by its own gravity. However, on 5 November 2002, the \"Galileo\" orbiter made a targeted flyby that came within 160\u00a0km of Amalthea, and the deflection of its orbit was used to compute the moon's mass (its volume had been calculated previously\u2014to within 10% or so\u2014from a careful analysis of all extant images). In the end, Amalthea's density was found to be as low as 0.86 g/cm3, so it must be either a relatively icy body or very porous \"rubble pile\" or, more likely, something in between. Recent measurements of infrared spectra from the Subaru telescope suggest that the moon indeed contains hydrous minerals, indicating that it cannot have formed in its current position, since the hot primordial Jupiter would have melted it. It is therefore likely to have formed farther from the planet or to be a captured Solar System body. No images were taken during this flyby (\"Galileo\"'s cameras had been deactivated due to radiation damage in January 2002), and the resolution of other available images is generally low.\nAmalthea radiates slightly more heat than it receives from the Sun, which is probably due to the influence of Jovian heat flux (&lt;9\u00a0kelvins), sunlight reflected from the planet (&lt;5\u00a0K), and charged particle bombardment (&lt;2\u00a0K). This is a trait shared with Io, although for different reasons.\nNamed geological features.\nThere are four named geological features on Amalthea: two craters and two faculae (bright spots). The faculae are located on the edge of a ridge on the anti-Jupiter side of Amalthea.\nCraters are named after characters in Greek mythology associated with Zeus and Amalthea, and faculae are named after locations associated with Zeus.\nRelationship with Jupiter's rings.\nDue to tidal force from Jupiter and Amalthea's low density and irregular shape, the escape velocity at its surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter is no more than 1\u00a0m/s, and dust can easily escape from it after, for example, micrometeorite impacts; this dust forms the Amalthea Gossamer Ring.\nDuring its flyby of Amalthea, the \"Galileo\" orbiter's star scanner detected nine flashes that appeared to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea. Because they were sighted only from one location, their true distances could not be measured. These moonlets may be anywhere in size from gravel to stadium-sized. Their origins are unknown, but they may be gravitationally captured into the current orbit or they may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On the next and final orbit (just an hour before destruction), \"Galileo\" detected one more such moonlet. However, this time Amalthea was on the other side of the planet, so it is probable that the particles form a ring around the planet near Amalthea's orbit.\nViews to and from Amalthea.\nFrom Jupiter's \"surface\"\u2014or rather, from just above its cloudtops\u2014Amalthea would appear very bright, shining with a magnitude of \u22124.7, similar to that of Venus from Earth. At only 5\u00a0arcminutes across, its disc would be barely discernible. Amalthea's orbital period is only slightly longer than its parent planet's day (about 20% in this case), which means it would cross Jupiter's sky very slowly. The time between moonrise and moonset would be over 29\u00a0hours.\nScience journalist Willy Ley suggested Amalthea as a base for observing Jupiter, because of its nearness to the planet, almost-synchronous orbit, and small size making a landing easy. From the surface of Amalthea, Jupiter would look enormous: at 46\u00a0degrees across, it would appear roughly 85 times wider than the full moon from Earth. Because Amalthea is in synchronous rotation, Jupiter would not appear to move, and would not be visible from one side of Amalthea. The Sun would disappear behind Jupiter's bulk for an hour and a half each revolution, and Amalthea's short rotation period gives it just under six hours of daylight. Though Jupiter would appear 900\u00a0times brighter than the full moon, its light would be spread over an area some 8,500\u00a0times greater and it would not look as bright per surface unit.\nExploration.\nIn 1979, the unmanned \"Voyager 1\" and \"Voyager 2\" space probes obtained the first images of Amalthea to resolve its surface features. They also measured the visible and infrared spectra and surface temperature. Later, the \"Galileo\" orbiter completed the imaging of Amalthea's surface. \"Galileo\" made its final satellite fly-by at a distance of approximately from Amalthea's center (at a height of about 160\u2013170\u00a0km) on 5 November 2002, permitting the moon's mass to be accurately determined, while changing \"Galileo's\" trajectory so that it would plunge into Jupiter in September 2003 at the end of its mission. In 2006, Amalthea's orbit was refined with measurements from \"New Horizons\" during its flyby of Jupiter. Additional observations of the moon (albeit, from great distances) would continue to be made by NASA's \"Juno\", which arrived to Jupiter in 2016.\nIn fiction.\nAmalthea is the setting of several works of science fiction, including stories by Arthur C. Clarke, James Blish, and Arkady and Boris Strugatsky.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCited sources"}

She is described either as a nymph who raises the child on the milk of a goat, or, in some accounts from the Hellenistic period onwards, as the goat itself.\nAs early as the archaic period, there exist references to the \"horn of Amalthea\" (known in Latin as the cornucopia), a magical horn said to be capable of producing endless amounts of any food or drink desired. In a narrative attributed to the mythical poet Musaeus, and likely dating to the 4th century BC or earlier, Amalthea, a nymph, nurses the infant Zeus and owns a goat which is terrifying in appearance. After Zeus reaches adulthood, he uses the goat's skin as a weapon in his battle against the Titans. Amalthea is first described as a goat by the 3rd-century BC poet Callimachus, who presents a rationalised version of the myth, in which Zeus is fed on Amalthea's milk. Aratus, also writing in the 3rd century BC, identifies Amalthea with the star Capella, and describes her as \"Olenian\" (the meaning of which is unclear).\nThere is disagreement among scholars as to when the tale of Zeus's upbringing was first merged with that of the magical horn. The first author to explicitly combine them is the Roman poet Ovid (1st century BC/AD), whose story of Zeus's nursing weaves together elements from multiple earlier accounts. A passage from a scholium (or commentary) on Aratus's account has been taken as evidence that the two myths may have been connected prior to Ovid. Another version of Zeus's childhood is found in the 2nd-century AD \"Fabulae\", in which Amalthea hides the infant in a tree and gathers the Kouretes to dance noisily, so that the child's crying cannot be heard. Other accounts of Zeus's upbringing describe Amalthea as being related to Melisseus, the king of Crete, including an Orphic version of the story.\nAmong the relatively few surviving representations of Amalthea in ancient art are a 2nd-century AD marble relief which depicts her as a nymph feeding Zeus out of a large cornucopia, and multiple coins and medallions from the Roman Empire. In modern art, she has been the subject of 17th- and 18th-century works by sculptors such as Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Pierre Julien and painters such as Jacob Jordaens.\nEtymology and origins.\nThe etymology of () is unknown. While 19th-century scholars proposed various derivations, these were dismissed in the early 20th century by Alfred Chilton Pearson, who suggested that the name may be related to (, 'soft, tender, weak') and (, 'sheaf, bundle'). The verb (, 'to nurture'), previously attested only by the \"Lexicon\" of Hesychius of Alexandria (5th or 6th century AD) and the \"Etymologicum Magnum\" (12th century AD), was thought by Otto Gruppe in 1906 to derive from Amalthea's name; Gruppe's suggestion was refuted by the word's discovery in a fragment, published the following year, from the writings of the 5th-century BC tragedian Sophocles. According to Pearson, the two words should instead be understood as having existed alongside each other, with this notion of \"abundance\" or \"plenty\" being embodied in certain mythological figures.\nIn Hesiod's \"Theogony\", an 8th-century BC poem which contains the earliest known account of Zeus's birth, there is no mention of Amalthea. Hesiod, does, however, describe the newborn Zeus as being taken to a cave on \"the Aegean mountain\" in Crete, which some scholars interpret as meaning \"Goat's Mountain\", seen as a reference to the story of Amalthea; Richard Wyatt Hutchinson takes this term as possible indication that the tradition in which Amalthea is a goat, though only attested from the Hellenistic period, may have existed earlier than that of her as a nymph. Other scholars, however, including M. L. West, see no reason to view Hesiod's name for the mountain as a reference to Amalthea. According to Lewis Richard Farnell, Amalthea may have been associated, at some point early on, with the Cretan goddess Dictynna, whose name is likely related to Mount Dicte (sometimes considered the birthplace of Zeus).\nMythology.\nHorn of Amalthea.\nThe \"horn of Amalthea\", referred to in Latin literature as the cornucopia, is a magical horn generally described as being able to produce an inexhaustible supply of any food or drink desired. The tale of this horn seems to have originated as an independent tradition to the raising of Zeus, though it is uncertain when the two merged. The \"horn of Amalthea\" is mentioned as early as the archaic period by poets such as Anacreon and Phocylides (who both date to the 6th century BC), and is commonly referenced in comedies, such as those by Cratinus (5th century BC) and Aristophanes (5th to early 4th centuries BC). According to the \"Bibliotheca\" of Apollodorus, the 5th-century BC mythographer Pherecydes described the horn's ability to provide endless food and drink as desired, and considered it to belong to the nymph Amalthea. In a lost poem by the 5th-century BC poet Pindar, Heracles fought against the river-god Achelous (who battled him in the form of a bull) for the hand of Deianeira, and during the fight Heracles pulled off one of Achelous's horns; the god then reclaimed his horn by trading it for the magical horn which he obtained from Amalthea, a daughter of Oceanus. In the same passage in which he cites Pherecydes, Apollodorus (1st to 2nd centuries AD) retells this story, and describes the nymph Amalthea as the daughter of Haemonius, whose name, meaning \"Thessalian\", indicates that this Amalthea is separate to the nurse of Zeus. In Apollodorus's account, Amalthea's horn is that of a bull (an element also mentioned by the 4th-to-3rd-century BC poet Philemon), seemingly a result of confusion with the bull's horn of Achelous, while in other versions of the myth, told by Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC) and Strabo (1st century BC/AD), the horn of Amalthea is identified with that of Achelous.\nNurse of Zeus.\nAmalthea is the figure most commonly described as the nurse of Zeus during his infancy, and in this role is often considered to be a nymph. In the account of Zeus's upbringing from the now-lost work \"Eumolpia\" (likely composed in or before the 4th century BC), which was attributed in antiquity to the mythical poet Musaeus, Amalthea was the nurse of the young Zeus, and a nymph. According to a summary of the \"Catasterismi\" of Eratosthenes (written by an author referred to as \"Pseudo-Eratosthenes\"), in the account attributed to Musaeus, Zeus's mother Rhea gave him as a newborn child to Themis, who handed him over to the nymph Amalthea, who had the infant nursed by a she-goat. Pseudo-Eratosthenes goes on to relate that this goat was the daughter of Helios, and was so terrifying in appearance that the Titans, out of fear, asked Gaia to hide her in a cave on Crete; Gaia complied, entrusting the goat to Amalthea. After Zeus reaches adulthood, he receives an oracle advising him to use the goat's skin as a weapon in his war against the Titans (due to its terrifying nature). According to the \"De astronomia\" (a work of astral mythology likely composed in the 2nd-century AD), which similarly recounts the narrative from Musaeus, this weapon which Zeus uses against the Titans is the aegis.\nVarious accounts of Zeus's upbringing rationalise Amalthea as a goat; these versions start appearing in the Hellenistic period. The first author to describe her as a goat seems to have been the 3rd-century BC poet Callimachus, who relates that, after Zeus's birth, the god is taken by the Arcadian nymph Neda to a hidden location in Crete, where he is reared by the nymph Adrasteia, and fed the milk of Amalthea. In his description of Zeus suckling Amalthea's breast, Callimachus employs the word (), which typically denotes the breast of a human (rather than the teat of a goat), thereby, according to Susan Stephens, \"call[ing] attention to his own rationalizing variant of the myth\". According to a scholium (or commentary) on Callimachus's account, from one of Amalthea's horns flows ambrosia, and from the other comes nectar. In the version of Zeus's infancy from Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC), the child is reared by nymphs (who are not named) on the milk of the goat Amalthea, as well as honey, and adds that Amalthea is the source of Zeus's epithet (, 'aegis-bearing'). An account which is largely the same as that given by Pseudo-Eratosthenes is found in a scholium on the \"Iliad\", though the scholiast describes Amalthea herself as the goat which terrifies the Titans (rather than the owner of the goat).\nIn Greek works of astral mythology, the tale of the goat who nurses the young Zeus is adapted to provide an aition (or origin myth) for certain stars. The 3rd-century BC poet Aratus, in his description of the constellation of the Charioteer (Auriga) and the surrounding stars, explains that the star of the Goat (Capella) sits above the Charioteer's left shoulder. He identifies this goat with Amalthea, describing it as the goat who suckled the young Zeus; in this passage, he employs the word for the goat's breast, similarly to Callimachus, who may be his source for this information. He also states that the \"interpreters of Zeus\" refer to her as the Olenian goat, which may be an allusion to a version in which Zeus is reared, by a goat, near Olenos in Achaea, or to the location of the star, on the arm (, ) of Auriga; alternatively, it may indicate that the Goat's father is Olenus (the son of Hephaestus), an interpretation given by a scholium on the passage. At the end of the account given by Pseudo-Eratosthenes, the text contains a lacuna (or gap), where he would have described Zeus placing the goat among the stars; in the \"Catasterismi\", the god would have performed this action for her role in his defeat of the Titans, and her nursing of him during his youth.\nMerging of traditions.\nAccording to Robert Fowler, the nursing of Zeus by a goat and the originally independent tradition of the magical horn had become \"entangled\" by the time of Pherecydes; Jan N. Bremmer, however, states that it was not until Ovid (who was active around the beginning of the 1st century AD) that the two tales were brought together. In Ovid's account, presented in his \"Fasti\", Amalthea is once again the owner of the goat, and is described as a naiad who lives on Mount Ida. She hides the young Zeus in Crete (away from his father, Cronus), where he is suckled by the she-goat. On one occasion, the goat snaps off one of its horns on a tree, and Amalthea, filling the broken horn with fruit, brings it back to the young Zeus; this tale, an aition for the cornucopia, appears to be the earliest attempt at providing an origin for the object. Zeus later places the goat (and perhaps her broken-off horn) in the heavens, with the goat becoming the star Capella. Ovid's narrative brings together elements from multiple earlier accounts, which he intertwines in an episode characterised by John Miller as a \"miniature masterpiece\". His source for the narrative's overall outline appears to be Eratosthenes: he describes Amalthea as a nymph, and seemingly alludes to Zeus's war with the Titans, though he notably departs from the Eratosthenic story by describing the goat as 'beautiful' () and possessing majestic horns. Ovid harks back to Aratus's account in the first words of his narrative, which mirror the opening phrase of the Aratean story, as well as through his description of the goat as \"Olenian\". Barbara Boyd also sees in Ovid's narrative significant influence from the Callimachean account of Zeus's infancy.\nThough Ovid's \"Fasti\" is the first known source to clearly narratively merge the tradition of Zeus's upbringing with that of Amalthea's magical horn, Miller points to a (somewhat garbled) scholium on Aratus as evidence that the two tales may have already been connected by the time of Ovid. The scholiast, who appears to mix two differing versions, one in which Zeus's nurse is an Arcadian woman, and another in which she is a goat, describes the horn of this nurse as being Amalthea's horn, which he associates with the constellation of the Goat; Amalthea's horn here would seem to be the magical horn of plenty, though the two are not explicitly identified. Miller also points, as possible further evidence of a tradition in which the two tales were connected, to the scholium on Callimachus, whose mention of ambrosia and nectar flowing from the goat's horns may have been related to the young Zeus's nourishment, and a 2nd-century AD marble relief, which seems to show Amalthea feeding the young Zeus from a large cornucopia.\nLater versions.\nIn the account of Zeus's infancy in the \"Fabulae\" (a mythological handbook attributed to Hyginus, and likely composed in the 2nd century AD), his elder siblings are seemingly not swallowed (as they are in Hesiod's \"Theogony\"), though Rhea still gives Cronus a stone in place of Zeus, which he consumes. Upon realising the deception, Cronus scours the earth for his son, while Hera carries the infant to Crete, where she entrusts him to Amalthea, who appears to be a nymph in this account. To keep Zeus from his father, Amalthea hides him in a cradle, which she places in a tree, such that he \"could not be found in the sky, on earth, or on the sea\". To prevent Cronus from hearing the cries of the young child, Amalthea brings together the Kouretes, and hands them shields and spears, which she instructs them to clang noisily around where the child lies. According to Martin Nilsson, this account is likely not the creation of Hyginus himself, and probably has some basis in an association of the young Zeus with tree worship. Later in the work, Hyginus mentions , which M. L. West interprets as referring to Amalthea, and describes her as one of the daughters of Ocean (here seemingly meaning Oceanus), alongside Adrasteia and Ida. He adds that these three are alternatively considered daughters of Melisseus, the king of Crete, and nurses of Zeus.\nOther versions of Zeus's upbringing also describe Amalthea as being related to Melisseus, the king of Crete. In the account given by the late-1st-century BC writer Didymus, the infant Zeus is raised by the nymphs Amalthea and Melissa, the daughters of Melisseus, who feed him honey and the milk of a goat. In Apollodorus's version of Zeus's infancy, the god is born in a cave on Cretan Mount Dicte, where he is fed on the milk of Amalthea; he is raised by the nymphs Adrasteia and Ida, the daughters of Melisseus, and protected by the Kouretes, who noisily clang their spears and shields. Similarly, in the \"De astronomia\", Amalthea is the she-goat who suckles Jupiter (the Roman equivalent of Zeus), and she is owned by his nurses, the daughters of Melisseus. Amalthea also seems to have been associated with Melisseus in the now-lost Orphic Rhapsodies, a 1st-century BC or 1st-century AD theogonic poem which was attributed to the mythical poet Orpheus in antiquity. Luc Brisson and M. L. West write that, in the poem, Amalthea was the wife of Melisseus (a detail transmitted by the 5th-century AD Neoplatonist philosopher Hermias), and that her daughters by him, the nymphs Adrasteia and Ida, raised the young Zeus in the cave of Night, while the Kouretes guarded the entrance of the cave. In Alberto Bernab\u00e9's reconstruction of the poem, however, Zeus is raised by the nymphs Adrasteia and Ida (still the daughters of Melisseus), and is fed on the milk of Amalthea, whom Bernab\u00e9 describes as a \"goat-nymph\" (). An Orphic work may have been the source for the version of Zeus's upbringing told by Apollodorus.\nDiodorus Siculus, in a euhemerist reworking of Amalthea's myth, describes her as an especially beautiful young woman, who is wed to Ammon, the king of Libya; Ammon gifts to her a region of great fertility, which is the shape of a bull's horn, and which, taking its name from her, comes to be known as \"Amalthea's Horn\". In this version, Amalthea and Ammon are also described as the parents of Dionysus. The 1st-century BC Roman writer Cicero, in a letter to his friend Atticus, mentions an , which was likely some form of shrine to Amalthea; on his estate, Atticus had such a shrine, within which were illustrations of Amalthea's mythology, and Cicero, seeking to erect a similar structure on his land in Arpinum, requests that Atticus provide him details of his own shrine and of Amalthea's mythology. In a version from the 2nd-century AD Greek writer Zenobius, when Zeus places the goat from his childhood among the stars (as the constellation known as the \"heavenly goat\"), he sets aside one of her horns, which he gifts to the nymphs who raised him. The \"De astronomia\", after its account of Jupiter's upbringing, states that, alongside Jupiter, the goat Amalthea also raises Aegipan ('Goat-Pan'), and Nonnus, a 5th-century AD Greek writer, describes Pan as the shepherd of the goat Amalthea.\nIconography.\nThere are relatively few surviving depictions of Amalthea in ancient Greek and Roman art. On a marble relief, which likely dates to the 2nd century AD, she is shown as a nymph, holding a large cornucopia out to the young Zeus, from which the infant eats. The scene also includes a young Pan playing a syrinx, two goats, and an eagle and a snake sitting in a tree. In this representation, Miller sees a number of parallels with Ovid's narrative, and he points to the relief as evidence that Amalthea's horn may have been part of the myth of Zeus's upbringing prior to Ovid, suggesting that Ovid and the artist who produced the relief may have been working from a shared source. There exist several other representations of Amalthea as a nymph, though she is more commonly depicted as a goat. As a goat, she is often shown suckling the young Zeus, or with the child mounted upon her back. Amalthea is also found on coins and medallions from the Roman Empire, including those from the reigns of Titus and Gallienus.\nOther representations.\nThe Septuagint (dated to around the 2nd century BC) version of the Book of Job gives the name of the youngest daughter of Job, Keren-happuch, as (, 'horn of Amalthea'), a name the Roman author Pliny the Elder explicitly identifies with the cornucopia. In the 4th-century AD, the Christian bishop Gregory of Nyssa writes that the text's usage of this term should not be taken as reason to believe in the mythical Greek tale of Amalthea, but that it is the text's way of emphasising the virtuous character and beautiful appearance of Job's daughter.\nIn modern art, Amalthea was the subject of a sculpture by the Baroque sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini, which was among his first works, having been produced in 1615 or earlier. The work depicts Amalthea as a goat, and shows the infant Jupiter drinking her milk, accompanied by a young satyr, and was for some time thought to have been produced in antiquity. The work, which was acquired by Scipione Borghese in 1615, may have served a political purpose; it may have been used by the Borghese family as a way of portraying the appointment of Pope Paul V as ushering in a \"new Golden Age\", represented by the mythical figure of Amalthea, who personified abundance. The myth of the goat Amalthea was a common subject for the Flemish painter Jacob Jordaens, whose paintings of the scene in some cases included elements such as a satyr playing a flute or tambourine, or a nymph holding a milk pitcher looking while at the audience. A print by Schelte a Bolswert, after one of Jordaens' paintings of Amalthea, is accompanied by an inscription which presents a moral interpretation of the myth, explaining that Jupiter's adulterous ways are unsurprising, given he is raised by a goat and satyrs, an upbringing which leads him to emulate a \"goat's nature\". Around 1786 to 1787, the French sculptor Pierre Julien produced a work depicting Amalthea as a nymph, covered in drapery and accompanied by a goat; when the sculpture was exhibited in 1791, it received high praise, attracting comparison from one critic with the classical Greek sculptures of Praxiteles and Phidias. Julien also produced a relief in which Amalthea is a she-goat, which depicts, in addition to the young Jupiter and several nymphs, a number of Corybantes shown dancing raucously.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Her Polish marriage was arranged to strengthen the ties between Mieszko and her uncle Emperor Otto III. She returned to Germany following the deposition of her husband in 1031, either divorcing or separating from him. Upon the death of her brother Duke Otto II of Swabia and the consequent extinction of the male line of her family, Richeza became a nun, worked to preserve the Ezzonen heritage, and funded the restoration of the Abbey of Brauweiler. She has been beatified.\nFamily and betrothal.\nShe was the eldest daughter of Count Palatine Ezzo of Lotharingia by his wife, Matilda, daughter of Emperor Otto II and Empress Theophanu. Richeza's parents were married in 993. Polish historian Kazimierz Jasi\u0144ski supposed that she was few years younger than her husband Mieszko II Lambert.\nIn 1000 during the Congress of Gniezno, an agreement was apparently made between Boles\u0142aw the Brave and Richeza's uncle Emperor Otto III. Among the usual political talks, they decided to strengthen ties through marriage. Otto's childlessness meant that the seven daughters of his sister Mathilde (the only of Otto II's daughters who married and produced children) were the potential brides for Mieszko, Boles\u0142aw I's son and heir; the oldest of Otto III's nieces, Richeza, was chosen. However, Otto's unexpected death in 1002, the reorientation of the Holy Roman Empire politics by his successor, Henry II, and wars between Henry and Boles\u0142aw led to the delay of the wedding. The Emperor took the opportunity of a settlement with the Ezzonen family and in Merseburg negotiated a temporary peace with Poland. The marriage between Mieszko and Richeza took place in Merseburg, probably during the Pentecost festivities.\nQueenship.\nAfter the final peace agreement between the Holy Roman Empire and Poland, which was signed in 1018 in Bautzen, Richeza and Mieszko maintained close contact with the German court. In 1021 they participated in the consecration of part of the Bamberg Cathedral.\nBoles\u0142aw I the Brave died on 17 June 1025. Six months later, on Christmas Day, Mieszko II Lambert and Richeza were crowned king and queen of Poland by the archbishop of Gniezno, Hipolit, in the Gniezno Cathedral. Mieszko's reign was short-lived: in 1031, the invasion of both German and Kievan troops forced him to escape to Bohemia, where he was imprisoned and castrated by orders of Duke Oldrich. Mieszko II's half-brother Bezprym took the government of Poland and began a cruel persecution of the followers of the former king. The Brauweiler Chronicle indicated that soon after the escape of her husband, Richeza and her children fled to Germany with the Polish regalia, which were given to Emperor Conrad II. She subsequently played an important role in mediating a peace settlement between Poland and the Holy Roman Empire. However, modern historians discount this account.\nRicheza and Mieszko II never reunited; according to some sources, they were either officially divorced or separated. After Bezprym was murdered in 1032, Mieszko II was released from captivity and returned to Poland, but was forced to divide the country between himself, his brother Otto and their cousin Dytryk. One year later (1033), after Otto was killed and Dytryk expelled from the country, Mieszko II reunited Poland under his domain. However, his rule lasted only one year: on 10 or 11 July 1034, Mieszko II died suddenly, probably killed as a result of a conspiracy.\nRicheza's son Casimir was at that time at the court of her brother Archbishop Hermann II of Cologne. In 1037 Casimir returned to Poland in order to claim the throne; apparently, Richeza also returned with him, although this is disputed. Soon after, a barons' rebellion \u2014 coupled with the so-called \"Pagan Reaction\" of the commoners \u2014 forced both Casimir and Richeza to flee to Germany again. She never returned.\nReturn to Germany.\nThe return of Richeza to Germany forced a redistribution of her father's inheritance because at the previous arrangement, it was not contemplated that Richeza would need a place to live. She received Saalfeld, a possession that did not belong to the Lower Rhine area in which the Ezzonen dynasty tried to build a coherent dominion. Richeza still called herself queen of Poland, a privilege that was given to her by the emperor. In Saalfeld she led the Polish opposition that supported her son Casimir, who in 1039, with the help of Conrad II, finally obtained the Polish throne. During the years 1040\u20131047, Richeza lived in Klotten in the Moselle region.\nOn 7 September 1047 Richeza's brother Duke Otto II of Swabia, the last male representative of the Ezzonen dynasty, died, and with him the territorial and political objectives of his family. Richeza now inherited large parts of the Ezzonen possessions.\nOtto's death seems to have touched Richeza. At his funeral in Brauweiler, according to Bruno of Toul (later Pope Leo IX), she put her fine jewellery on the altar. She declared that she would spend the rest of her life as a nun to preserve the memory of the Ezzonen dynasty. Another goal was probably to secure the remaining Ezzonen rights.\nA charter dated 17 July 1051 noted that Richeza participated in the reorganization of the Ezzonen properties. Her sister Theophanu, Abbess of Essen, and her brother, Hermann II, Archbishop of Cologne and Richeza transferred the Abbey of Brauweiler to the Archdiocese of Cologne. This created a dispute with the Emperor, as this transfer had already occurred under the reign of Ezzo. This was successfully challenged by Ezzo's surviving children. The reason for the transfer was likely that the future wasn't secured for the descendants of the Ezzonen: From Ezzo's ten children, only Richeza and Otto had children. None of these children was in a position of real power over the Ezzonen inheritance. The transfer to the diocese, headed by Hermann II with one of the younger Ezzonen, ensured the cohesion of the property. In 1054 in connection with some donations to the Abbey of Brauweiler, Richeza expressed her desire to be buried there beside her mother. This reorganization, which apparently emanated from the hope that Hermann II would survive his siblings, failed because he died in 1056. The Archbishop of Cologne, Anno II, tried to increase the power of his diocese at the expense of the Ezzonen.\nRicheza responded to Anno II's ambitions with the formal renunciation of her possessions in Brauweiler to the monastery of Moselle, while reserving the lifelong use of the lands. Brauweiler was the center of Ezzonen memory and she wanted it protected regardless of the economic position of the family. Then Richeza went to Saalfeld, where she found similar arrangements in favour of the Diocese of W\u00fcrzburg. Anno II protested against these regulations unsuccessfully. In the end, Richeza only maintained direct rule over the towns of Saalfeld and Coburg, but retained the right to use until her death seven other locations in the Rhineland with their additional incomes, and 100 silver pounds per year by the Archdiocese of Cologne. Richeza died on 21 March 1063 in Saalfeld.\nHeritage.\nRicheza was buried in Cologne's church of St. Maria ad Gradus and not, as she had wished, in Brauweiler. This was prompted by Archbishop Anno II, who appealed to an oral agreement with Richeza. The Klotten estate donated her funeral arrangements to St. Maria ad Gradus, whose relationship with Richeza, Hermann II and Anno II is unclear. Possibly St. Maria ad Gradus was an unfinished work of Richeza's brother and completed by Anno II, who wanted to secure part of the Ezzonen patrimony in this way. The Brauweiler Abbey claimed the validity of the 1051 charter and demanded the remains of the Polish Queen.\nThe dispute ended in 1090 when the then-current archbishop of Cologne, Hermann III, ruled in favour of the monastery of Brauweiler. However, Richeza's grave remained in St. Maria ad Gradus until 1816, when it was transferred to Cologne Cathedral. Her grave was placed in the chapel dedicated to St. John the Baptist in a classic wooden sarcophagus. Beside the coffin hang two medieval portraits of Richeza and Anno II that originate from the medieval grave in St. Maria ad Gradus.\nHer grave was opened multiple times after the transfer to Cologne Cathedral. The last opening was in 1959 and revealed her bones. According to witnesses, Richeza had a small and graceful stature. Her collarbone showed traces of a fracture. Richeza's relics were located in St. Nicholas church in Brauweiler and were moved to the Klotter parish church in 2002.\nMarriage and issue.\nRicheza and Mieszko had: \nLegacy.\nThe most important of Richeza's projects was the rebuilding of the Abbey of Brauweiler. Her parents had founded Brauweiler, but the original church was modestly furnished, which was incompatible with the dynasty's territorial objectives. After Otto's death, Richeza decided to make Brauweiler the centre of Ezzonen memory. Since the original building didn't suit this purpose, Richeza built a new abbey, which remains in good condition. When the construction began a three-aisled pillared basilica was planned with a projecting transept to the east apse across a crypt. The aisles were groined vaults with flat ceilings in the central nave. Inside, the nave had five , each of which was half as large as the square crossing. Throughout the Abbey the cross-vaulted ceiling could be seen (for example in the aisles, pillars or the crypt), which can be found in many Ezzonen buildings. The crypt was consecrated on 11 December 1051. The rest of the construction was consecrated on 30 October 1063, seven months after Richeza's death.\nThe building has distinct references to the Church of St. Maria im Kapitol in Cologne, founded by Richeza's sister Ida. Both crypts are laid out identically, the two bays in Brauweiler, however, were shorter. In the upper church, there are clear references. Brauweiler is seen as a copy of the Cologne Cathedral, probably thanks to the influence of Richeza's brother Hermann II, who in 1040 consecrated Stavelot Abbey. Richeza planned to make Brauweiler the Ezzonen family crypt, in 1051 interring the remains of her sister Adelaide, Abbess of Nivelles. In 1054 she transferred the remains of her father from Augsburg to be buried next to her sister.\nThe Gospel Book of Queen Richeza (today in possession of the Universit\u00e4ts- und Landesbibliothek Darmstadt), comes from St. Maria ad Gradus, where Richeza had a space reserved in the central nave, normally occupied by the Donors. It is not clear whether this was done at the behest of Anno II, or by Richeza. An indication of the latter thesis, however, is the Gospel Book. The manuscript is made of 153 pages in the pergamin style in an 18 x 13.5\u00a0cm format. In 150 of the pages of the book, a prayer is recorded, which suggests a high-born owner. The following pages contain entries about the Ezzonen memorial. In addition to Richeza, Anno II and her parents were named. The entries can be counted among drawings in the Codex style recognized around 1100. The Codex itself was built around 1040, probably in Maasland, with incomplete ornamentation: the Mark and Luke are drawn completely, but only in a preliminary sketch. Matthew wasn't drawn. Another possible indication is the Codex date: After 1047, Richeza took her monastic vows and had no need for a personal representative signature. It is unknown whether it remained in her possession and was used together with other relics of Anno II from her estate of St. Maria ad Gradus, or had already been donated to her brother before her death.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There is a difference between an ad valorem tax and a specific tax or subsidy in the way it is applied to the price of the good. In the end levying a tax moves the market to a new equilibrium where the price of a good paid by buyers increases and the proportion of the price received by sellers decreases. The incidence of a tax does not depend on whether the buyers or sellers are taxed since taxes levied on sellers are likely to be met by raising the price charged to buyers. Most of the burden of a tax falls on the less elastic side of the market because of a lower ability to respond to the tax by changing the quantity sold or bought. Introduction of a subsidy, on the other hand, may either lowers the price of production which encourages firms to produce more, or lowers the price paid by buyers, encouraging higher sales volume. Such a policy is beneficial both to sellers and buyers.\nSpecific tax impact.\nSource:\nThe effect of a specific tax levied on sellers can be divided into three steps. \nFirst, the demand for a good is the same for a given price level so the demand curve does not change. On the other hand, the tax makes the good in fact more expensive to produce for the seller. This means that the business is less profitable for a given price level and the supply curve shifts upwards. \nSecond, the higher cost of producing the good reduces the quantity supplied at any given price. The upward shifted supply curve is parallel to the original supply curve because no matter the quantity supplied, the seller\u2019s expenses on the production are the same. Therefore the distance between the original and the new shifted supply curve is equal to the amount of tax imposed. Whatever the price of the good, the net price for which the sellers are selling is effectively the gross price less the amount of the tax. This makes the sellers supply the amount of the good as if the price were lower by the amount of the tax. In order for them to supply a given quantity of the good, the market price needs to be higher by the amount of tax to preserve net income from sales. \nLast, after the shift of the supply curve is taken into account, the difference between the initial and after-tax equilibrium can be observed. The growth of market price is determined by the price elasticities of demand and supply. In the case of demand being more elastic than supply, the incidence of the tax falls more heavily on sellers and the consumers feel a smaller growth of price and vice versa. In both cases, the consumers pay more for the good and while the sellers initially receive more money, after the tax is accounted for, they are left with less money than if there were no tax imposed. \nThe tax raises the price which the customers pay for the good (unless the absorb the whole tax cost) and lowers the price the producers are effectively selling the good for unless they pass on the whole tax cost. The difference between the two prices remains the same no matter who bears most of the burden of the tax.\nExample.\nThe original equilibrium price is $3.00 and the equilibrium quantity is 100. The government then levies a tax of $0.50 on the sellers. This leads to a new supply curve which is shifted upward by $0.50 compared to the original supply curve. The new equilibrium price will sit between $3.00 and $3.50 and the equilibrium quantity will decrease. If we say that the consumers pay $3.30 and the new equilibrium quantity is 80, then the producers keep $2.80 and the total tax revenue equals $0.50 x 80 = $40.00. The burden of the tax paid by buyers is $0.30 x 80 = $2.40 and the burden paid by sellers equals $0.20 x 80 = $1.60.\nAd valorem tax impact.\nSource:\nSimilarly the effect can be broken down into three steps. \nFirst, the tax again affects the sellers. The quantity demanded at a given price remains unchanged and therefore the demand curve stays the same. Since the tax is a certain percentage of the price, with increasing price, the tax grows as well. The supply curve shifts upward but the new supply curve is not parallel to the original one.\nSecond, the tax raises the production cost as with the specific tax but the amount of tax varies with price level. The upward shift of the supply curve is accompanied by a pivot upwards and to the left of the original supply curve. The vertical distance between the two supply curves is equal to the amount of tax in per cent. The effective price to the sellers is again lower by the amount of the tax and they will supply the good as if the price were lower by the amount of tax. \nLast, the total impact of the tax can be observed. The equilibrium price of the good rises and the equilibrium quantity decreases. The buyers and sellers again share the burden of the tax relative to their price elasticities. The buyers have to pay more for the good and the sellers receive less money than before the tax has been imposed. \nExample.\nThe pre-tax equilibrium price is $5.00 with respective equilibrium quantity of 100. The government imposes a 20 per cent tax on the sellers. A new supply curve emerges. It is shifted upward and pivoted to the left and upwards in comparison to the original supply curve and their distance is always 20 per cent of the original price. In the pre-tax equilibrium the distance equals $5.00 x 0.20 = $1.00. This burden of the tax is again shared by the buyer and seller. If the new equilibrium quantity decreases to 85 and the buyer bears a higher proportion of the tax burden (e.g. $0.75), the total amount of tax collected equals $1.00 x 85 = $85.00. The buyer then faces the tax of $0.75 x 85 = $63.75 and the tax paid by the seller equals $0.25 x 85 = $21.25. The price the consumer buys the good for equals $5.75 but the seller only receives $4.75.\nSubsidy impact.\nMarginal subsidies on production will shift the supply curve to the right until the vertical distance between the two supply curves is equal to the per unit subsidy; when other things remain equal, this will decrease price paid by the consumers (which is equal to the new market price) and increase the price received by the producers. Similarly, a marginal subsidy on consumption will shift the demand curve to the right; when other things remain equal, this will decrease the price paid by consumers and increase the price received by producers by the same amount as if the subsidy had been granted to producers. However, in this case, the new market price will be the price received by producers. The end result is that the lower price that consumers pay and the higher price that producers receive will be the same, regardless of how the subsidy is administered.\nEffect of elasticity.\nDepending on the price elasticities of demand and supply, who bears more of the tax or who receives more of the subsidy may differ. Where the supply curve is less elastic than the demand curve, producers bear more of the tax and receive more of the subsidy than consumers as the difference between the price producers receive and the initial market price is greater than the difference borne by consumers. Where the demand curve is more inelastic than the supply curve, the consumers bear more of the tax and receive more of the subsidy as the difference between the price consumers pay and the initial market price is greater than the difference borne by producers.\nAn illustration.\nThe effect of this type of tax can be illustrated on a standard supply and demand diagram. Without a tax, the equilibrium price will be at \"Pe\" and the equilibrium quantity will be at \"Qe\".\nAfter a tax is imposed, the price consumers pay will shift to \"Pc\" and the price producers receive will shift to \"Pp\". The consumers' price will be equal to the producers' price plus the cost of the tax. Since consumers will buy less at the higher consumer price (\"Pc\") and producers will sell less at a lower producer price (\"Pp\"), the quantity sold will fall from \"Qe\" to \"Qt\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47262", "revid": "50014652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47262", "title": "2 Pallas", "text": "Third-largest asteroid\nPallas (minor-planet designation: 2\u00a0Pallas) is the third-largest asteroid in the Solar System by volume and mass. It is the second asteroid to have been discovered, after Ceres, and is likely a remnant protoplanet. Like Ceres, it is believed to have a mineral composition similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, though significantly less hydrated than Ceres. It is 79% the mass of Vesta and 22% the mass of Ceres, constituting an estimated 7% of the total mass of the asteroid belt. Its estimated volume is equivalent to a sphere in diameter, 90\u201395% the volume of Vesta.\nDuring the planetary formation era of the Solar System, objects grew in size through an accretion process to approximately the size of Pallas. Most of these protoplanets were incorporated into the growth of larger bodies, which became the planets, whereas others were ejected by the planets or destroyed in collisions with each other. Pallas, Vesta and Ceres appear to be the only intact bodies from this early stage of planetary formation to survive within the orbit of Neptune.\nWhen Pallas was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers on 28 March 1802, it was considered to be a planet, as were other asteroids in the early 19th century. The discovery of many more asteroids after 1845 eventually led to the separate listing of \"minor\" planets from \"major\" planets, and the realization in the 1950s that such small bodies did not form in the same way as (other) planets led to the gradual abandonment of the term \"minor planet\" in favor of \"asteroid\" (or, for larger bodies such as Pallas, \"planetoid\").\nWith an orbital inclination of 34.8\u00b0, Pallas's orbit is unusually highly inclined to the plane of the asteroid belt, making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft, and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as large as that of Pluto.\nThe high inclination of the orbit of Pallas results in the possibility of close conjunctions to stars that other solar objects always pass at great angular distance. This resulted in Pallas passing Sirius on 9 October 2022, only 8.5 arcminutes southwards, while no planet can get closer than 30 degrees to Sirius.\nHistory.\nDiscovery.\nOn the night of 5 April 1779, Charles Messier recorded Pallas on a star chart he used to track the path of a comet, now known as C/1779\u00a0A1 (Bode), that he observed in the spring of 1779, but apparently assumed it was nothing more than a star.\nIn 1801, the astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered an object which he initially believed to be a comet. Shortly thereafter he announced his observations of this object, noting that the slow, uniform motion was uncharacteristic of a comet, suggesting it was a different type of object. This was lost from sight for several months, but was recovered later that year by the Baron von Zach and Heinrich W. M. Olbers after a preliminary orbit was computed by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This object came to be named Ceres, and was the first asteroid to be discovered.\nA few months later, Olbers was again attempting to locate Ceres when he noticed another moving object in the vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before this point it had been speculated by astronomers that there should be a planet in the gap between Mars and Jupiter. Now, unexpectedly, a second such body had been found. When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size were as high as 3,380\u00a0km in diameter. Even as recently as 1979, Pallas was estimated to be 673\u00a0km in diameter, 26% greater than the currently accepted value.\nThe orbit of Pallas was determined by Gauss, who found the period of 4.6 years was similar to the period for Ceres. Pallas has a relatively high orbital inclination to the plane of the ecliptic.\nLater observations.\nIn 1917, the Japanese astronomer Kiyotsugu Hirayama began to study asteroid motions. By plotting the mean orbital motion, inclination, and eccentricity of a set of asteroids, he discovered several distinct groupings. In a later paper he reported a group of three asteroids associated with Pallas, which became named the Pallas family, after the largest member of the group. Since 1994 more than 10 members of this family have been identified, with semi-major axes between 2.50 and 2.82\u00a0AU and inclinations of 33\u201338\u00b0. The validity of the family was confirmed in 2002 by a comparison of their spectra.\nPallas has been observed occulting stars several times, including the best-observed of all asteroid occultation events, by 140 observers on 29 May 1983. These measurements resulted in the first accurate calculation of its diameter.\nAfter an occultation on 29 May 1979, the discovery of a possible tiny satellite with a diameter of about 1\u00a0km was reported, which was never confirmed.\nRadio signals from spacecraft in orbit around Mars and/or on its surface have been used to estimate the mass of Pallas from the tiny perturbations induced by it onto the motion of Mars.\nThe \"Dawn\" team was granted viewing time on the Hubble Space Telescope in September 2007 for a once-in-twenty-year opportunity to view Pallas at closest approach, to obtain comparative data for Ceres and Vesta.\nName and symbol.\n\"Pallas\" is an epithet of the Greek goddess Athena (). In some versions of the myth, Athena accidentally killed Pallas, daughter of Triton, then adopted her friend's name out of mourning.\nThe adjectival form of the name is \"Palladian\". The \"d\" is part of the oblique stem of the Greek name, which appears before a vowel but disappears before the nominative ending \"-s\". The oblique form is seen in the Italian and Russian names for the asteroid, and ().\nThe stony-iron pallasite meteorites are not Palladian, being named instead after the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas. The chemical element palladium, on the other hand, was named after the asteroid, which had been discovered just before the element.\nThe old astronomical symbol of Pallas, still used in astrology, is a spear or lance, \u27e8\u27e9, one of the symbols of the goddess. The blade was most often a lozenge (\u25ca), but various graphic variants were published, including an acute/elliptic leaf shape, a cordate leaf shape (\u2664: ), and a triangle (\u25b3); the last made it effectively the alchemical symbol for sulfur, \u27e8\u27e9. The generic asteroid symbol of a disk with its discovery number, \u27e8\u2461\u27e9, was introduced in 1852 and quickly became the norm. The iconic lozenge symbol was resurrected for astrological use in 1973.\nOrbit and rotation.\nPallas has unusual dynamic parameters for such a large body. Its orbit is highly inclined and moderately eccentric, despite being at the same distance from the Sun as the central part of the asteroid belt. Furthermore, Pallas has a very high axial tilt of 84\u00b0, with its north pole pointing towards ecliptic coordinates (\u03b2,\u00a0\u03bb) = (30\u00b0,\u00a0\u221216\u00b0) with a 5\u00b0 uncertainty in the Ecliptic J2000.0 reference frame. This means that every Palladian summer and winter, large parts of the surface are in constant sunlight or constant darkness for a time on the order of an Earth year, with areas near the poles experiencing continuous sunlight for as long as two years.\nNear resonances.\nPallas is in a near-1:1 orbital resonance with Ceres, which is probably coincidental. Pallas also has a near-18:7 resonance (91,000-year period) and an approximate 5:2 resonance (83-year period) with Jupiter.\nTransits of planets from Pallas.\nFrom Pallas, the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Earth can occasionally appear to transit, or pass in front of, the Sun. Earth last did so in 1968 and 1998, and will next transit in 2224. Mercury did in October 2009. The last and next by Venus are in 1677 and 2123, and for Mars they are in 1597 and 2759.\nPhysical characteristics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBoth Vesta and Pallas have assumed the title of second-largest asteroid from time to time. At in diameter, Pallas is now understood to be slightly smaller than Vesta (). The mass of Pallas is that of Vesta, that of Ceres, and a quarter of one percent that of the Moon.\nPallas is farther from Earth and has a much lower albedo than Vesta, and hence is dimmer as seen from Earth. Indeed, the much smaller asteroid 7 Iris marginally exceeds Pallas in mean opposition magnitude. Pallas's mean opposition magnitude is +8.0, which is well within the range of 10\u00d750 binoculars, but, unlike Ceres and Vesta, it will require more-powerful optical aid to view at small elongations, when its magnitude can drop as low as +10.6. During rare perihelic oppositions, Pallas can reach a magnitude of +6.4, right on the edge of naked-eye visibility. During late February 2014 Pallas shone with magnitude 6.96.\nPallas is a B-type asteroid. Based on spectroscopic observations, the primary component of the material on Pallas's surface is a silicate containing little iron and water. Minerals of this type include olivine and pyroxene, which are found in CM chondrules. The surface composition of Pallas is very similar to the Renazzo carbonaceous chondrite (CR) meteorites, which are even lower in hydrous minerals than the CM type. The Renazzo meteorite was discovered in Italy in 1824 and is one of the most primitive meteorites known. Pallas's visible and near-infrared spectrum is almost flat, being slightly brighter in towards the blue. There is only one clear absorption band in the 3-micron part, which suggests an anhydrous component mixed with hydrated CM-like silicates.\nPallas's surface is most likely composed of a silicate material; its spectrum and calculated density () correspond to CM chondrite meteorites (), suggesting a mineral composition similar to that of Ceres, but significantly less hydrated.\nTo within observational limits, Pallas appears to be saturated with craters. Its high inclination and eccentricity means that average impacts are much more energetic than on Vesta or Ceres (with on average twice their velocity), meaning that smaller (and thus more common) impactors can create equivalently sized craters. Indeed, Pallas appears to have many more large craters than either Vesta or Ceres, with craters larger than 40\u00a0km covering at least 9% of its surface.\nPallas's shape departs significantly from the dimensions of an equilibrium body at its current rotational period, indicating that it is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, and thus does not meet the definition of a dwarf planet. It is possible that a suspected large impact basin at the south pole, which ejected of the volume of Pallas (twice the volume of the Rheasilvia basin on Vesta), may have increased its inclination and slowed its rotation; the shape of Pallas without such a basin would be close to an equilibrium shape for a 6.2-hour rotational period. A smaller crater near the equator is associated with the Palladian family of asteroids.\nPallas probably has a quite homogeneous interior. The close match between Pallas and CM chondrites suggests that they formed in the same era and that the interior of Pallas never reached the temperature (\u2248820 K) needed to dehydrate silicates, which would be necessary to differentiate a dry silicate core beneath a hydrated mantle. Thus Pallas should be rather homogeneous in composition, though some upward flow of water could have occurred since. Such a migration of water to the surface would have left salt deposits, potentially explaining Pallas's relatively high albedo. Indeed, one bright spot is reminiscent of those found on Ceres. Although other explanations for the bright spot are possible (e.g. a recent ejecta blanket), if the near-Earth asteroid 3200 Phaethon is an ejected piece of Pallas, as some have theorized, then a Palladian surface enriched in salts would explain the sodium abundance in the Geminid meteor shower caused by Phaethon.\nSurface features.\nBesides one bright spot in the southern hemisphere, the only surface features identified on Pallas are craters. As of 2020, 36 craters have been identified, 34 of which are larger than 40\u00a0km in diameter. Provisional names have been provided for some of them. The craters are named after ancient weapons.\nSatellites.\nA small moon about 1 kilometer in diameter was suggested based on occultation data from 29 May 1978. In 1980, speckle interferometry suggested a much larger satellite, whose existence was refuted a few years later with occultation data.\nExploration.\nPallas itself has never been visited by spacecraft. Proposals have been made in the past though none have come to fruition. A flyby of the \"Dawn\" probe's visits to 4 Vesta and 1 Ceres was discussed but was not possible due to the high orbital inclination of Pallas. The proposed \"Athena\" SmallSat mission would have been launched in 2022 as a secondary payload of the \"Psyche\" mission and travel on separate trajectory to a flyby encounter with 2 Pallas, though was not funded due to being outcompeted by other mission concepts such as the TransOrbital Trailblazer Lunar Orbiter. The authors of the proposal cited Pallas as the \"largest unexplored\" main-belt protoplanet.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47263", "revid": "48736052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47263", "title": "243 Ida", "text": "Main-belt asteroid\n243 Ida is an asteroid in the Koronis family of the asteroid belt. It was discovered on 29 September 1884 by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at Vienna Observatory and named after a nymph from Greek mythology. Later telescopic observations categorized Ida as an S-type asteroid, the most numerous type in the inner asteroid belt. On 28 August 1993, Ida was visited by the uncrewed \"Galileo\" spacecraft while en route to Jupiter. It was the second asteroid visited by a spacecraft and the first found to have a natural satellite.\nIda's orbit lies between the planets Mars and Jupiter, like all main-belt asteroids. Its orbital period is 4.84 years, and its rotation period is 4.63 hours. Ida has an average diameter of . It is irregularly shaped and elongated, apparently composed of two large objects connected together. Its surface is one of the most heavily cratered in the Solar System, featuring a wide variety of crater sizes and ages.\nIda's moon Dactyl was discovered by mission member Ann Harch in images returned from \"Galileo\". It was named after the Dactyls, creatures which inhabited Mount Ida in Greek mythology. Dactyl is only in diameter, about 1/20 the size of Ida. Its orbit around Ida could not be determined with much accuracy, but the constraints of possible orbits allowed a rough determination of Ida's density and revealed that it is depleted of metallic minerals. Dactyl and Ida share many characteristics, suggesting a common origin.\nThe images returned from \"Galileo\" and the subsequent measurement of Ida's mass provided new insights into the geology of S-type asteroids. Before the \"Galileo\" flyby, many different theories had been proposed to explain their mineral composition. Determining their composition permits a correlation between meteorites falling to the Earth and their origin in the asteroid belt. Data returned from the flyby pointed to S-type asteroids as the source for the ordinary chondrite meteorites, the most common type found on the Earth's surface.\nDiscovery and observations.\nIda was discovered on 29 September 1884 by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at the Vienna Observatory. It was his 45th asteroid discovery. Ida was named by Moriz von Kuffner, a Viennese brewer and amateur astronomer. In Greek mythology, Ida was a nymph of Crete who raised the god Zeus. Ida was recognized as a member of the Koronis family by Kiyotsugu Hirayama, who proposed in 1918 that the group comprised the remnants of a destroyed precursor body.\nIda's reflection spectrum was measured on 16 September 1980 by astronomers David J. Tholen and Edward F. Tedesco as part of the eight-color asteroid survey (ECAS). Its spectrum matched those of the asteroids in the S-type classification. Many observations of Ida were made in early 1993 by the US Naval Observatory in Flagstaff and the Oak Ridge Observatory. These improved the measurement of Ida's orbit around the Sun and reduced the uncertainty of its position during the \"Galileo\" flyby from .\nExploration.\n\"Galileo\" flyby.\nIda was visited in 1993 by the Jupiter-bound space probe \"Galileo\". Its encounters of the asteroids Gaspra and Ida were secondary to the Jupiter mission. These were selected as targets in response to a new NASA policy directing mission planners to consider asteroid flybys for all spacecraft crossing the belt. No prior missions had attempted such a flyby. \"Galileo\" was launched into orbit by the Space Shuttle \"Atlantis\" mission STS-34 on 18 October 1989. Changing \"Galileo's\" trajectory to approach Ida required that it consume of propellant. Mission planners delayed the decision to attempt a flyby until they were certain that this would leave the spacecraft enough propellant to complete its Jupiter mission.\n\"Galileo's\" trajectory carried it into the asteroid belt twice on its way to Jupiter. During its second crossing, it flew by Ida on 28 August 1993 at a speed of relative to the asteroid. The onboard imager observed Ida from a distance of to its closest approach of . Ida was the second asteroid, after Gaspra, to be imaged by a spacecraft. About 95% of Ida's surface came into view of the probe during the flyby.\nTransmission of many Ida images was delayed due to a permanent failure in the spacecraft's high-gain antenna. The first five images were received in September 1993. These comprised a high-resolution mosaic of the asteroid at a resolution of 31\u201338\u00a0m/pixel. The remaining images were sent in February 1994, when the spacecraft's proximity to the Earth allowed higher speed transmissions.\nDiscoveries.\nThe data returned from the \"Galileo\" flybys of Gaspra and Ida, and the later \"NEAR Shoemaker\" asteroid mission, permitted the first study of asteroid geology. Ida's relatively large surface exhibited a diverse range of geological features. The discovery of Ida's moon Dactyl, the first confirmed satellite of an asteroid, provided additional insights into Ida's composition.\nIda is classified as an S-type asteroid based on ground-based spectroscopic measurements. The composition of S-types was uncertain before the \"Galileo\" flybys, but was interpreted to be either of two minerals found in meteorites that had fallen to the Earth: ordinary chondrite (OC) and stony-iron. Estimates of Ida's density are constrained to less than 3.2\u00a0g/cm3 by the long-term stability of Dactyl's orbit. This all but rules out a stony-iron composition; were Ida made of 5\u00a0g/cm3 iron- and nickel-rich material, it would have to contain more than 40% empty space.\nThe Galileo images also led to the discovery that space weathering was taking place on Ida, a process which causes older regions to become more red in color over time. The same process affects both Ida and its moon, although Dactyl shows a lesser change. The weathering of Ida's surface revealed another detail about its composition: the reflection spectra of freshly exposed parts of the surface resembled that of OC meteorites, but the older regions matched the spectra of S-type asteroids.Both of these discoveries\u2014the space weathering effects and the low density\u2014led to a new understanding about the relationship between S-type asteroids and OC meteorites. S-types are the most numerous kind of asteroid in the inner part of the asteroid belt. OC meteorites are, likewise, the most common type of meteorite found on the Earth's surface. The reflection spectra measured by remote observations of S-type asteroids, however, did not match that of OC meteorites. The \"Galileo\" flyby of Ida found that some S-types, particularly the Koronis family, could be the source of these meteorites.\nPhysical characteristics.\nIda's mass is between 3.65 and 4.99\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016\u00a0kg. Its gravitational field produces an acceleration of about 0.3 to 1.1\u00a0cm/s2 over its surface. This field is so weak that an astronaut standing on its surface could leap from one end of Ida to the other, and an object moving in excess of could escape the asteroid entirely.\nIda is a distinctly elongated asteroid, with an irregular surface. Ida is 2.35 times as long as it is wide, and a \"waist\" separates it into two geologically dissimilar halves. This constricted shape is consistent with Ida being made of two large, solid components, with loose debris filling the gap between them. However, no such debris was seen in high-resolution images captured by \"Galileo\". Although there are a few steep slopes tilting up to about 50\u00b0 on Ida, the slope generally does not exceed 35\u00b0. Ida's irregular shape is responsible for the asteroid's very uneven gravitational field. The surface acceleration is lowest at the extremities because of their high rotational speed. It is also low near the \"waist\" because the mass of the asteroid is concentrated in the two halves, away from this location.\nSurface features.\nIda's surface appears heavily cratered and mostly gray, although minor color variations mark newly formed or uncovered areas. Besides craters, other features are evident, such as grooves, ridges, and protrusions. Ida is covered by a thick layer of regolith, loose debris that obscures the solid rock beneath. The largest, boulder-sized, debris fragments are called \"ejecta blocks\", several of which have been observed on the surface.\nRegolith.\nThe surface of Ida is covered in a blanket of pulverized rock, called \"regolith\", about thick. This material is produced in impact events and redistributed across Ida's surface by geological processes. \"Galileo\" observed evidence of recent downslope regolith movement.\nIda's regolith is composed of the silicate minerals olivine and pyroxene. Its appearance changes over time through a process called space weathering. Because of this process, older regolith appears more red in color compared to freshly exposed material.\nAbout 20 large (40\u2013150\u00a0m across) ejecta blocks have been identified, embedded in Ida's regolith. Ejecta blocks constitute the largest pieces of the regolith. Because ejecta blocks are expected to break down quickly by impact events, those present on the surface must have been either formed recently or uncovered by an impact event. Most of them are located within the craters Lascaux and Mammoth, but they may not have been produced there. This area attracts debris due to Ida's irregular gravitational field. Some blocks may have been ejected from the young crater Azzurra on the opposite side of the asteroid.\nStructures.\nSeveral major structures mark Ida's surface. The asteroid appears to be split into two halves, here referred to as \"region 1\" and \"region 2\", connected by a \"waist\". This feature may have been filled in by debris, or blasted out of the asteroid by impacts.\nRegion 1 of Ida contains two major structures. One is a prominent ridge named \"Townsend Dorsum\" that stretches 150 degrees around Ida's surface. The other structure is a large indentation named \"Vienna Regio\".\nIda's region 2 features several sets of grooves, most of which are wide or less and up to long. They are located near, but are not connected with, the craters Mammoth, Lascaux, and Kartchner. Some grooves are related to major impact events, for example a set opposite Vienna Regio.\nCraters.\nIda is one of the most densely cratered bodies yet explored in the Solar System, and impacts have been the primary process shaping its surface. Cratering has reached the saturation point, meaning that new impacts erase evidence of old ones, leaving the total crater count roughly the same. It is covered with craters of all sizes and stages of degradation, and ranging in age from fresh to as old as Ida itself. The oldest may have been formed during the breakup of the Koronis family parent body. The largest crater, Lascaux, is almost across. Region 2 contains nearly all of the craters larger than in diameter, but Region 1 has no large craters at all. Some craters are arranged in chains.\nIda's major craters are named after caves and lava tubes on Earth. The crater Azzurra, for example, is named after a submerged cave on the island of Capri, also known as the \"Blue Grotto\". Azzurra seems to be the most recent major impact on Ida. The ejecta from this collision is distributed discontinuously over Ida and is responsible for the large-scale color and albedo variations across its surface. An exception to the crater morphology is the fresh, asymmetric Fingal, which has a sharp boundary between the floor and wall on one side. Another significant crater is Afon, which marks Ida's prime meridian.\nThe craters are simple in structure: bowl-shaped with no flat bottoms and no central peaks. They are distributed evenly around Ida, except for a protrusion north of crater Choukoutien which is smoother and less cratered. The ejecta excavated by impacts is deposited differently on Ida than on planets because of its rapid rotation, low gravity and irregular shape. Ejecta blankets settle asymmetrically around their craters, but fast-moving ejecta that escapes from the asteroid is permanently lost.\nComposition.\nIda was classified as an S-type asteroid based on the similarity of its reflectance spectra with similar asteroids. S-types may share their composition with stony-iron or ordinary chondrite (OC) meteorites. The composition of the interior has not been directly analyzed, but is assumed to be similar to OC material based on observed surface color changes and Ida's bulk density of 2.27\u20133.10 g/cm3. OC meteorites contain varying amounts of the silicates olivine and pyroxene, iron, and feldspar. Olivine and pyroxene were detected on Ida by \"Galileo\". The mineral content appears to be homogeneous throughout its extent. \"Galileo\" found minimal variations on the surface, and the asteroid's spin indicates a consistent density. Assuming that its composition is similar to OC meteorites, which range in density from 3.48 to 3.64 g/cm3, Ida would have a porosity of 11\u201342%.\nIda's interior probably contains some amount of impact-fractured rock, called \"megaregolith\". The megaregolith layer of Ida extends between hundreds of meters below the surface to a few kilometers. Some rock in Ida's core may have been fractured below the large craters Mammoth, Lascaux, and Undara.\nOrbit and rotation.\nIda is a member of the Koronis family of asteroid-belt asteroids. Ida orbits the Sun at an average distance of , between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Ida takes 4.84089 years to complete one orbit.\nIda rotates in the retrograde direction with a rotation period of 4.63 hours (roughly 5 hours). The calculated maximum moment of inertia of a uniformly dense object the same shape as Ida coincides with the spin axis of the asteroid. This suggests that there are no major variations of density within the asteroid. Ida's axis of rotation precesses with a period of 77 thousand years, due to the gravity of the Sun acting upon the nonspherical shape of the asteroid.\nOrigin.\nIda originated in the breakup of the roughly diameter Koronis parent body. The progenitor asteroid had partially differentiated, with heavier metals migrating to the core. Ida carried away insignificant amounts of this core material. It is uncertain how long ago the disruption event occurred. According to an analysis of Ida's cratering processes, its surface is more than a billion years old. However, this is inconsistent with the estimated age of the Ida\u2013Dactyl system of less than 100\u00a0million years; it is unlikely that Dactyl, due to its small size, could have escaped being destroyed in a major collision for longer. The difference in age estimates may be explained by an increased rate of cratering from the debris of the Koronis parent body's destruction.\nDactyl.\nIda has a moon named Dactyl, official designation (243) Ida I. It was discovered in images taken by the \"Galileo\" spacecraft during its flyby in 1993. These images provided the first direct confirmation of an asteroid moon. At the time, it was separated from Ida by a distance of , moving in a prograde orbit. Dactyl is heavily cratered, like Ida, and consists of similar materials. Its origin is uncertain, but evidence from the flyby suggests that it originated as a fragment of the Koronis parent body.\nDiscovery.\nDactyl was found on 17 February 1994 by \"Galileo\" mission member Ann Harch, while examining delayed image downloads from the spacecraft. \"Galileo\" recorded 47 images of Dactyl over an observation period of 5.5 hours in August 1993. The spacecraft was from Ida and from Dactyl when the first image of the moon was captured, 14 minutes before \"Galileo\" made its closest approach.\nDactyl was initially designated 1993 (243) 1. It was named by the International Astronomical Union in 1994, for the mythological dactyls who inhabited Mount Ida on the island of Crete.\nPhysical characteristics.\nDactyl is an \"egg-shaped\" but \"remarkably spherical\" object measuring . It is oriented with its longest axis pointing towards Ida. Like Ida, Dactyl's surface exhibits saturation cratering. It is marked by more than a dozen craters with a diameter greater than , indicating that the moon has suffered many collisions during its history. At least six craters form a linear chain, suggesting that it was caused by locally produced debris, possibly ejected from Ida. Dactyl's craters may contain central peaks, unlike those found on Ida. These features, and Dactyl's spheroidal shape, imply that the moon is gravitationally controlled despite its small size. Like Ida, its average temperature is about .\nDactyl shares many characteristics with Ida. Their albedos and reflection spectra are very similar. The small differences indicate that the space weathering process is less active on Dactyl. Its small size would make the formation of significant amounts of regolith impossible. This contrasts with Ida, which is covered by a deep layer of regolith.\nThe two largest imaged craters on Dactyl were named Acmon and Celmis , after two of the mythological dactyls. Acmon is the largest crater in the above image, and Celmis is near the bottom of the image, mostly obscured in shadow. The craters are 300 and 200 meters in diameter, respectively.\nOrbit.\nDactyl's orbit around Ida is not precisely known. \"Galileo\" was in the plane of Dactyl's orbit when most of the images were taken, which made determining its exact orbit difficult. Dactyl orbits in the prograde direction and is inclined about 8\u00b0 to Ida's equator. Based on computer simulations, Dactyl's pericenter must be more than about from Ida for it to remain in a stable orbit. The range of orbits generated by the simulations was narrowed down by the necessity of having the orbits pass through points at which \"Galileo\" observed Dactyl to be at 16:52:05 UT on 28 August 1993, about from Ida at longitude 85\u00b0. On 26 April 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope observed Ida for eight hours and was unable to spot Dactyl. It would have been able to observe it if it were more than about from Ida.\nIf in a circular orbit at the distance at which it was seen, Dactyl's orbital period would be about 20 hours. Its orbital speed is roughly , \"about the speed of a fast run or a slowly thrown baseball\".\nAge and origin.\nDactyl may have originated at the same time as Ida, from the disruption of the Koronis parent body. However, it may have formed more recently, perhaps as ejecta from a large impact on Ida. It is extremely unlikely that it was captured by Ida. Dactyl may have suffered a major impact around 100\u00a0million years ago, which reduced its size.\nReferences.\nJournal articles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47264", "revid": "4796325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47264", "title": "Asteroid belt", "text": "Region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter\nThe asteroid belt is a torus-shaped region in the Solar System, centered on the Sun and roughly spanning the space between the orbits of the planets Jupiter and Mars. It contains a great many solid, irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The identified objects are of many sizes, but much smaller than planets, and, on average, are about one million kilometers (or six hundred thousand miles) apart. This asteroid belt is also called the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System.\nThe asteroid belt is the smallest and innermost circumstellar disc in the Solar System. Classes of small Solar System bodies in other regions are the near-Earth objects, the centaurs, the Kuiper belt objects, the scattered disc objects, the sednoids, and the Oort cloud objects. About 60% of the main belt mass is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the asteroid belt is estimated to be 3% that of the Moon.\nCeres, the only object in the asteroid belt large enough to be a dwarf planet, is about 950\u00a0km in diameter, whereas Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea have mean diameters less than 600\u00a0km. The remaining mineralogically classified bodies range in size down to a few metres. The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that numerous uncrewed spacecraft have traversed it without incident. Nonetheless, collisions between large asteroids occur and can produce an asteroid family, whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions. Individual asteroids within the belt are categorized by their spectra, with most falling into three basic groups: carbonaceous (C-type), silicate (S-type), and metal-rich (M-type).\nThe asteroid belt formed from the primordial solar nebula as a group of planetesimals, the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. However, between Mars and Jupiter gravitational perturbations from Jupiter disrupted their accretion into a planet, imparting excess kinetic energy which shattered colliding planetesimals and most of the incipient protoplanets. As a result, 99.9% of the asteroid belt's original mass was lost in the first 100\u00a0million years of the Solar System's history. Some fragments eventually found their way into the inner Solar System, leading to meteorite impacts with the inner planets. Asteroid orbits continue to be appreciably perturbed whenever their period of revolution about the Sun forms an orbital resonance with Jupiter. At these orbital distances, a Kirkwood gap occurs as they are swept into other orbits.\nHistory of observation.\nIn 1596, Johannes Kepler wrote, \"Between Mars and Jupiter, I place a planet,\" in his \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\", stating his prediction that a planet would be found there. While analyzing Tycho Brahe's data, Kepler thought that too large a gap existed between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter to fit his own model of where planetary orbits should be found.\nIn an anonymous footnote to his 1766 translation of Charles Bonnet's \"Contemplation de la Nature\", the astronomer Johann Daniel Titius of Wittenberg noted an apparent pattern in the layout of the planets, now known as the Titius-Bode Law. If one began a numerical sequence at 0, then included 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, etc., doubling each time, and added four to each number and divided by 10, this produced a remarkably close approximation to the radii of the orbits of the known planets as measured in astronomical units, \"provided\" one allowed for a \"missing planet\" (equivalent to 24 in the sequence) between the orbits of Mars (12) and Jupiter (48). In his footnote, Titius declared, \"But should the Lord Architect have left that space empty? Not at all.\" When William Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781, the planet's orbit closely matched the law, leading some astronomers to conclude that a planet had to be between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.\nOn January 1, 1801, Giuseppe Piazzi, chairman of astronomy at the University of Palermo, Sicily, found a tiny moving object in an orbit with exactly the radius predicted by this pattern. He dubbed it \"Ceres\", after the Roman goddess of the harvest and patron of Sicily. Piazzi initially believed it to be a comet, but its lack of a coma suggested it was a planet.\nThus, the aforementioned pattern predicted the semimajor axes of all eight planets of the time (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Ceres, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus). Concurrent with the discovery of Ceres, an informal group of 24 astronomers dubbed the \"celestial police\" was formed under the invitation of Franz Xaver von Zach with the express purpose of finding additional planets; they focused their search for them in the region between Mars and Jupiter where the Titius\u2013Bode law predicted there should be a planet.\nAbout 15 months later, Heinrich Olbers, a member of the celestial police, discovered a second object in the same region, Pallas. Unlike the other known planets, Ceres and Pallas remained points of light even under the highest telescope magnifications instead of resolving into discs. Apart from their rapid movement, they appeared indistinguishable from stars.\nAccordingly, in 1802, William Herschel suggested they be placed into a separate category, named \"asteroids\", after the Greek \"asteroeides\", meaning \"star-like\". Upon completing a series of observations of Ceres and Pallas, he concluded,\nNeither the appellation of planets nor that of comets can with any propriety of language be given to these two stars ... They resemble small stars so much as hardly to be distinguished from them. From this, their asteroidal appearance, if I take my name, and call them Asteroids; reserving for myself, however, the liberty of changing that name, if another, more expressive of their nature, should occur.\nBy 1807, further investigation revealed two new objects in the region: Juno and Vesta. The burning of Lilienthal in the Napoleonic Wars, where the main body of work had been done, brought this first period of discovery to a close.\nDespite Herschel's coinage, for several decades it remained common practice to refer to these objects as planets and to prefix their names with numbers representing their sequence of discovery: 1\u00a0Ceres, 2\u00a0Pallas, 3\u00a0Juno, 4\u00a0Vesta. In 1845, though, the astronomer Karl Ludwig Hencke detected a fifth object (5\u00a0Astraea) and, shortly thereafter, new objects were found at an accelerating rate. Counting them among the planets became increasingly cumbersome. Eventually, they were dropped from the planet list (as first suggested by Alexander von Humboldt in the early 1850s) and Herschel's coinage, \"asteroids\", gradually came into common use.\nThe discovery of Neptune in 1846 led to the discrediting of the Titius\u2013Bode law in the eyes of scientists because its orbit was nowhere near the predicted position. To date, no scientific explanation for the law has been given, and astronomers' consensus regards it as a coincidence.\nThe expression \"asteroid belt\" came into use in the early 1850s, although pinpointing who coined the term is difficult. The first English use seems to be in the 1850 translation (by Elise Ott\u00e9) of Alexander von Humboldt's \"Cosmos\": \"[...] and the regular appearance, about the 13th of November and the 11th of August, of shooting stars, which probably form part of a belt of asteroids intersecting the Earth's orbit and moving with planetary velocity\". Another early appearance occurred in Robert James Mann's \"A Guide to the Knowledge of the Heavens\": \"The orbits of the asteroids are placed in a wide belt of space, extending between the extremes of [...]\". The American astronomer Benjamin Peirce seems to have adopted that terminology and to have been one of its promoters.\nOver 100 asteroids had been located by mid-1868, and in 1891, the introduction of astrophotography by Max Wolf accelerated the rate of discovery. A total of 1,000 asteroids had been found by 1921, 10,000 by 1981, and 100,000 by 2000. Modern asteroid survey systems now use automated means to locate new minor planets in ever-increasing numbers.\nOn 22 January 2014, European Space Agency (ESA) scientists reported the detection, for the first definitive time, of water vapor on Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt. The detection was made by using the far-infrared abilities of the Herschel Space Observatory. The finding was unexpected because comets, not asteroids, are typically considered to \"sprout jets and plumes\". According to one of the scientists, \"The lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids\".\nOrigin.\nFormation.\nIn 1802, shortly after discovering Pallas, Olbers suggested to Herschel and Carl Gauss that Ceres and Pallas were fragments of a much larger planet that once occupied the Mars\u2013Jupiter region, with this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a cometary impact many million years before, while Odesan astronomer K. N. Savchenko suggested that Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta were escaped moons rather than fragments of the exploded planet. The large amount of energy required to destroy a planet, combined with the belt's low combined mass, which is only about 4% of the mass of Earth's Moon, does not support these hypotheses. Further, the significant chemical differences between the asteroids become difficult to explain if they come from the same planet.\nA modern hypothesis for the asteroid belt's creation relates to how, in general for the Solar System, planetary formation is thought to have occurred via a process comparable to the long-standing nebular hypothesis; a cloud of interstellar dust and gas collapsed under the influence of gravity to form a rotating disc of material that then conglomerated to form the Sun and planets. During the first few million years of the Solar System's history, an accretion process of sticky collisions caused the clumping of small particles, which gradually increased in size. Once the clumps reached sufficient mass, they could draw in other bodies through gravitational attraction and become planetesimals. This gravitational accretion led to the formation of the planets.\nPlanetesimals within the region that would become the asteroid belt were strongly perturbed by Jupiter's gravity. Orbital resonances occurred where the orbital period of an object in the belt formed an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter, perturbing the object into a different orbit; the region lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter contains many such orbital resonances. As Jupiter migrated inward following its formation, these resonances would have swept across the asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other. In regions where the average velocity of the collisions was too high, the shattering of planetesimals tended to dominate over accretion, preventing the formation of a planet. Instead, they continued to orbit the Sun as before, occasionally colliding.\nDuring the early history of the Solar System, the asteroids melted to some degree, allowing elements within them to be differentiated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive volcanism and formed magma oceans. Because of the relatively small size of the bodies, though, the period of melting was necessarily brief compared to the much larger planets, and had generally ended about 4.5\u00a0billion years ago, in the first tens of millions of years of formation. In August 2007, a study of zircon crystals in an Antarctic meteorite believed to have originated from Vesta suggested that it, and by extension the rest of the asteroid belt, had formed rather quickly, within 10\u00a0million years of the Solar System's origin.\nEvolution.\nThe asteroids are not pristine samples of the primordial Solar System. They have undergone considerable evolution since their formation, including internal heating (in the first few tens of millions of years), surface melting from impacts, space weathering from radiation, and bombardment by micrometeorites. Although some scientists refer to the asteroids as residual planetesimals, other scientists consider them distinct.\nThe current asteroid belt is believed to contain only a small fraction of the mass of the primordial belt. Computer simulations suggest that the original asteroid belt may have contained mass equivalent to the Earth's. Primarily because of gravitational perturbations, most of the material was ejected from the belt within about 1\u00a0million years of formation, leaving behind less than 0.1% of the original mass. Since its formation, the size distribution of the asteroid belt has remained relatively stable; no significant increase or decrease in the typical dimensions of the main-belt asteroids has occurred.\nThe 4:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter, at a radius 2.06\u00a0astronomical units (AUs), can be considered the inner boundary of the asteroid belt. Perturbations by Jupiter send bodies straying there into unstable orbits. Most bodies formed within the radius of this gap were swept up by Mars (which has an aphelion at 1.67\u00a0AU) or ejected by its gravitational perturbations in the early history of the Solar System. The Hungaria asteroids lie closer to the Sun than the 4:1 resonance, but are protected from disruption by their high inclination.\nWhen the asteroid belt was first formed, the temperatures at a distance of 2.7\u00a0AU from the Sun formed a \"snow line\" below the freezing point of water. Planetesimals formed beyond this radius were able to accumulate ice.\nIn 2006, a population of comets had been discovered within the asteroid belt beyond the snow line, which may have provided a source of water for Earth's oceans. According to some models, outgassing of water during the Earth's formative period was insufficient to form the oceans, requiring an external source such as a cometary bombardment.\nThe outer asteroid belt includes a few icy objects that may have been implanted there during the last few hundred years. One of these objects is the quasi-Hilda comet 362P/, which is thought to be a possible former centaur that was sent to the outer asteroid belt via a close encounter with Jupiter.\nCharacteristics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nContrary to popular imagery, the asteroid belt is mostly empty. The asteroids are spread over such a large volume that reaching an asteroid without aiming carefully would be improbable. Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known, and the total number ranges in the millions or more, depending on the lower size cutoff. Over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100\u00a0km, and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that the asteroid belt has between 700,000 and 1.7\u00a0million asteroids with a diameter of 1\u00a0km or more.\nThe number of asteroids in the main belt steadily increases with decreasing size. Although the size distribution generally follows a power law, there are 'bumps' in the curve at about and , where more asteroids than expected from such a curve are found. Most asteroids larger than approximately in diameter are primordial, having survived from the accretion epoch, whereas most smaller asteroids are products of fragmentation of primordial asteroids. The primordial population of the main belt was probably 200 times what it is today.\nOn average the distance between the asteroids is about , although this varies among asteroid families and smaller undetected asteroids might be even closer. The total mass of the asteroid belt is estimated to be kg, which is 3% of the mass of the Moon. The four largest objects, Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea, contain an estimated 62% of the belt's total mass, with 39% accounted for by Ceres alone.\nComposition.\nThe present day belt consists primarily of three categories of asteroids: C-type carbonaceous asteroids, S-type silicate asteroids, and a hybrid group of X-type asteroids. The hybrid group have featureless spectra, but they can be divided into three groups based on reflectivity, yielding the M-type metallic, P-type primitive, and E-type enstatite asteroids. Additional types have been found that do not fit within these primary classes. There is a compositional trend of asteroid types by increasing distance from the Sun, in the order of S, C, P, and the spectrally-featureless D-types.\nCarbonaceous asteroids, as their name suggests, are carbon-rich. They dominate the asteroid belt's outer regions, and are rare in the inner belt. Together they comprise over 75% of the visible asteroids. They are redder in hue than the other asteroids and have a low albedo. Their surface compositions are similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Chemically, their spectra match the primordial composition of the early Solar System, with hydrogen, helium, and volatiles removed.\nS-type (silicate-rich) asteroids are more common toward the inner region of the belt, within 2.5\u00a0AU of the Sun. The spectra of their surfaces reveal the presence of silicates and some metal, but no significant carbonaceous compounds. This indicates that their materials have been significantly modified from their primordial composition, probably through melting and reformation. They have a relatively high albedo and form about 17% of the total asteroid population.\nM-type (metal-rich) asteroids are typically found in the middle of the main belt, and they make up much of the remainder of the total population. Their spectra resemble that of iron-nickel. Some are believed to have formed from the metallic cores of differentiated progenitor bodies that were disrupted through collision. However, some silicate compounds also can produce a similar appearance. For example, the large M-type asteroid 22\u00a0Kalliope does not appear to be primarily composed of metal. Within the asteroid belt, the number distribution of M-type asteroids peaks at a semimajor axis of about 2.7\u00a0AU. Whether all M-types are compositionally similar, or whether it is a label for several varieties which do not fit neatly into the main C and S classes is not yet clear.\nOne mystery is the relative rarity of V-type (Vestoid) or basaltic asteroids in the asteroid belt. Theories of asteroid formation predict that objects the size of Vesta or larger should form crusts and mantles, which would be composed mainly of basaltic rock, resulting in more than half of all asteroids being composed either of basalt or of olivine. However, observations suggest that 99% of the predicted basaltic material is missing. Until 2001, most basaltic bodies discovered in the asteroid belt were believed to originate from the asteroid Vesta (hence their name V-type), but the discovery of the asteroid 1459\u00a0Magnya revealed a slightly different chemical composition from the other basaltic asteroids discovered until then, suggesting a different origin. This hypothesis was reinforced by the further discovery in 2007 of two asteroids in the outer belt, 7472\u00a0Kumakiri and , with a differing basaltic composition that could not have originated from Vesta. These two are the only V-type asteroids discovered in the outer belt to date.\nThe temperature of the asteroid belt varies with the distance from the Sun. For dust particles within the belt, typical temperatures range from 200\u00a0K (\u221273\u00a0\u00b0C) at 2.2\u00a0AU down to 165\u00a0K (\u2212108\u00a0\u00b0C) at 3.2\u00a0AU. However, due to rotation, the surface temperature of an asteroid can vary considerably as the sides are alternately exposed to solar radiation then to the stellar background.\nMain-belt comets.\nSeveral otherwise unremarkable bodies in the outer belt show cometary activity. Because their orbits cannot be explained through the capture of classical comets, many of the outer asteroids are thought to be icy, with the ice occasionally exposed to sublimation through small impacts. Main-belt comets may have been a major source of the Earth's oceans because the deuterium-hydrogen ratio is too low for classical comets to have been the principal source.\nOrbits.\nMost asteroids within the asteroid belt have orbital eccentricities of less than 0.4, and an inclination of less than 30\u00b0. The orbital distribution of the asteroids reaches a maximum at an eccentricity around 0.07 and an inclination below 4\u00b0. Thus, although a typical asteroid has a relatively circular orbit and lies near the plane of the ecliptic, some asteroid orbits can be highly eccentric or travel well outside the ecliptic plane.\nSometimes, the term \"main belt\" is used to refer only to the more compact \"core\" region where the greatest concentration of bodies is found. This lies between the strong 4:1 and 2:1 Kirkwood gaps at 2.06 and 3.27\u00a0AU, and at orbital eccentricities less than roughly 0.33, along with orbital inclinations below about 20\u00b0. As of 2006[ [update]], this \"core\" region contained 93% of all discovered and numbered minor planets within the Solar System. The JPL Small-Body Database lists over 1 million known main-belt asteroids.\nKirkwood gaps.\nThe semimajor axis of an asteroid is used to describe the dimensions of its orbit around the Sun, and its value determines the minor planet's orbital period. In 1866, Daniel Kirkwood announced the discovery of gaps in the distances of these bodies' orbits from the Sun. They were located in positions where their period of revolution about the Sun was an integer fraction of Jupiter's orbital period. Kirkwood proposed that the gravitational perturbations of the planet led to the removal of asteroids from these orbits.\nWhen the mean orbital period of an asteroid is an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter, a mean-motion resonance with the gas giant is created that is sufficient to perturb an asteroid to new orbital elements. Primordial asteroids entered these gaps because of the migration of Jupiter's orbit. Subsequently, asteroids primarily migrate into these gap orbits due to the Yarkovsky effect, but may also enter because of perturbations or collisions. After entering, an asteroid is gradually nudged into a different, random orbit with a larger or smaller semimajor axis.\nCollisions.\nThe high population of the asteroid belt makes for an active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on deep time scales). Impact events between main-belt bodies with a mean radius of 10\u00a0km are expected to occur about once every 10\u00a0million years. A collision may fragment an asteroid into numerous smaller pieces (leading to the formation of a new asteroid family). Conversely, collisions that occur at low relative speeds may also join two asteroids. After more than 4\u00a0billion years of such processes, the members of the asteroid belt now bear little resemblance to the original population.\nEvidence suggests that most main belt asteroids between 200\u00a0m and 10\u00a0km in diameter are rubble piles formed by collisions. These bodies consist of a multitude of irregular objects that are mostly bound together by self-gravity, resulting in significant amounts of internal porosity. Along with the asteroid bodies, the asteroid belt also contains bands of dust with particle radii of up to a few hundred micrometres. This fine material is produced, at least in part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids. Due to the Poynting\u2013Robertson effect, the pressure of solar radiation causes this dust to slowly spiral inward toward the Sun.\nThe combination of this fine asteroid dust, as well as ejected cometary material, produces the zodiacal light. This faint auroral glow can be viewed at night extending from the direction of the Sun along the plane of the ecliptic. Asteroid particles that produce visible zodiacal light average about 40\u00a0\u03bcm in radius. The typical lifetimes of main-belt zodiacal cloud particles are about 700,000\u00a0years. Thus, to maintain the bands of dust, new particles must be steadily produced within the asteroid belt. It was once thought that collisions of asteroids form a major component of the zodiacal light. However, computer simulations by Nesvorn\u00fd and colleagues attributed 85 percent of the zodiacal-light dust to fragmentations of Jupiter-family comets, rather than to comets and collisions between asteroids in the asteroid belt. At most 10 percent of the dust is attributed to the asteroid belt.\nMeteorites.\nSome of the debris from collisions can form meteoroids that enter the Earth's atmosphere. Of the 50,000 meteorites found on Earth to date, 99.8 percent are believed to have originated in the asteroid belt.\nFamilies and groups.\nIn 1918, the Japanese astronomer Kiyotsugu Hirayama noticed that the orbits of some of the asteroids had similar parameters, forming families or groups.\nApproximately one-third of the asteroids in the asteroid belt are members of an asteroid family. These share similar orbital elements, such as semi-major axis, eccentricity, and orbital inclination as well as similar spectral features, which indicate a common origin in the breakup of a larger body. Graphical displays of these element pairs, for members of the asteroid belt, show concentrations indicating the presence of an asteroid family. There are about 20 to 30 associations that are likely asteroid families. Additional groupings have been found that are less certain. Asteroid families can be confirmed when the members display similar spectral features. Smaller associations of asteroids are called groups or clusters.\nSome of the most prominent families in the asteroid belt (in order of increasing semi-major axes) are the Flora, Eunomia, Koronis, Eos, and Themis families. The Flora family, one of the largest with more than 800 known members, may have formed from a collision less than 1\u00a0billion years ago.\nThe largest asteroid to be a true member of a family is 4\u00a0Vesta. (This is in contrast to an interloper, in the case of Ceres with the Gefion family.) The Vesta family is believed to have formed as the result of a crater-forming impact on Vesta. Likewise, the HED meteorites may also have originated from Vesta as a result of this collision.\nThree prominent bands of dust have been found within the asteroid belt. These have similar orbital inclinations as the Eos, Koronis, and Themis asteroid families, and so are possibly associated with those groupings.\nThe main belt evolution after the Late Heavy Bombardment was likely affected by the passages of large centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). Centaurs and TNOs that reach the inner Solar System can modify the orbits of main belt asteroids, though only if their mass is of the order of for single encounters or, one order less in case of multiple close encounters. However, centaurs and TNOs are unlikely to have significantly dispersed young asteroid families in the main belt, although they can have perturbed some old asteroid families. Current main belt asteroids that originated as centaurs or trans-Neptunian objects may lie in the outer belt with short lifetime of less than 4\u00a0million years, most likely orbiting between 2.8 and 3.2\u00a0AU at larger eccentricities than typical of main belt asteroids.\nPeriphery.\nSkirting the inner edge of the belt (ranging between 1.78 and 2.0\u00a0AU, with a mean semi-major axis of 1.9\u00a0AU) is the Hungaria family of minor planets. They are named after the main member, 434\u00a0Hungaria; the group contains at least 52 named asteroids. The Hungaria group is separated from the main body by the 4:1 Kirkwood gap and their orbits have a high inclination. Some members belong to the Mars-crossing category of asteroids, and gravitational perturbations by Mars are likely a factor in reducing the total population of this group.\nAnother high-inclination group in the inner part of the asteroid belt is the Phocaea family. These are composed primarily of S-type asteroids, whereas the neighboring Hungaria family includes some E-types. The Phocaea family orbit between 2.25 and 2.5\u00a0AU from the Sun.\nSkirting the outer edge of the asteroid belt is the Cybele group, orbiting between 3.3 and 3.5\u00a0AU. The Hilda family orbit between 3.5 and 4.2\u00a0AU with relatively circular orbits and a stable 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter. There are few asteroids beyond 4.2\u00a0AU, until Jupiter's orbit. At the latter the two families of Trojan asteroids can be found, which, at least for objects larger than 1\u00a0km, are approximately as numerous as the asteroids of the asteroid belt.\nNew families.\nSome asteroid families have formed recently, in astronomical terms. The Karin family apparently formed about 5.7\u00a0million years ago from a collision with a progenitor asteroid 33\u00a0km in radius. The Veritas family formed about 8.3\u00a0million years ago; evidence includes interplanetary dust recovered from ocean sediment.\nMore recently, the Datura cluster appears to have formed about 530,000 years ago from a collision with a main-belt asteroid. The age estimate is based on the probability of the members having their current orbits, rather than from any physical evidence. However, this cluster may have been a source for some zodiacal dust material. Other recent cluster formations, such as the Iannini cluster (c.\u20091\u20135\u00a0million years ago), may have provided additional sources of this asteroid dust.\nExploration.\nThe first spacecraft to traverse the asteroid belt was \"Pioneer\u00a010\", which entered the region on 16 July 1972. At the time, there was some concern that the debris in the belt would pose a hazard to the spacecraft, but it has since been safely traversed by multiple spacecraft without incident. \"Pioneer\u00a011\", \"Voyagers\u00a01\" and \"2\" and \"Ulysses\" passed through the belt without imaging any asteroids. \"Cassini\" measured plasma and fine dust grains while traversing the belt in 2000. On its way to Jupiter, \"Juno\" traversed the asteroid belt without collecting science data. Due to the low density of materials within the belt, the odds of a probe running into an asteroid are estimated at less than 1 in 1\u00a0billion.\nMost main belt asteroids imaged to date have come from brief flyby opportunities by probes headed for other targets. Only the \"Dawn\" mission has studied main belt asteroids for a protracted period in orbit. The \"Galileo\" spacecraft imaged 951\u00a0Gaspra in 1991 and 243\u00a0Ida in 1993, then NEAR imaged 253\u00a0Mathilde in 1997 and landed on near\u2013Earth asteroid 433 Eros in February 2001. \"Cassini\" imaged 2685\u00a0Masursky in 2000, \"Stardust\" imaged 5535\u00a0Annefrank in 2002, \"New Horizons\" imaged 132524\u00a0APL in 2006, and \"Rosetta\" imaged 2867\u00a0\u0160teins in September 2008 and 21\u00a0Lutetia in July 2010. \"Dawn\" orbited Vesta between July 2011 and September 2012 and has orbited Ceres since March 2015.\nThe \"Lucy\" space probe made a flyby of 152830 Dinkinesh in 2023, on its way to the Jupiter Trojans. ESA's JUICE mission will pass through the asteroid belt twice, with a proposed flyby of the asteroid 223 Rosa in 2029. The \"Psyche\" spacecraft is a NASA mission to the large M-type asteroid 16 Psyche.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47265", "revid": "6046731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47265", "title": "Deadweight loss", "text": "Lost economic efficiency\nIn economics, deadweight loss is the loss of societal economic welfare due to production/consumption of a good at a quantity where marginal benefit (to society) does not equal marginal cost (to society). In other words, there are either goods being produced despite the cost of doing so being larger than the benefit, or additional goods are not being produced despite the fact that the benefits of their production would be larger than the costs. The deadweight loss is the net benefit that is missed out on. While losses to one entity often lead to gains for another, deadweight loss represents the loss that is not regained by anyone else. This loss is therefore attributed to both producers and consumers.\nDeadweight loss can also be a measure of lost economic efficiency when the socially optimal quantity of a good or a service is not produced. Non-optimal production can be caused by monopoly pricing in the case of artificial scarcity, a positive or negative externality, a tax or subsidy, or a binding price ceiling or price floor such as a minimum wage.\nExamples.\nAssume a market for nails where the cost of each nail is $0.10. Demand decreases linearly; there is a high demand for free nails and zero demand for nails at a price per nail of $1.10 or higher. The price of $0.10 per nail represents the point of economic equilibrium in a competitive market.\nMonopoly.\nIf market conditions are perfect competition, producers would charge a price of $0.10, and every customer whose marginal benefit exceeds $0.10 would buy a nail. A monopoly producer of this product would typically charge whatever price will yield the greatest profit for themselves, regardless of lost efficiency for the economy as a whole. In this example, the monopoly producer charges $0.60 per nail, thus excluding every customer from the market with a marginal benefit less than $0.60. The deadweight loss due to monopoly pricing would then be the economic benefit foregone by customers with a marginal benefit of between $0.10 and $0.60 per nail. The monopolist has \"priced them out of the market\", even though their benefit exceeds the true cost per nail.\nSubsidy.\nConversely, deadweight loss can also arise from consumers buying \"more\" of a product than they otherwise would based on their marginal benefit and the cost of production. For example, if in the same nail market the government provided a $0.03 subsidy for every nail produced, the subsidy would reduce the market price of each nail to $0.07, even though production actually still costs $0.10 per nail. Consumers with a marginal benefit of between $0.07 and $0.10 per nail would then buy nails, even though their benefit is less than the real production cost of $0.10. The difference between the cost of production and the purchase price then creates the \"deadweight loss\" to society.\nTax.\nA tax has the opposite effect of a subsidy. Whereas a subsidy entices consumers to buy a product that would otherwise be too expensive for them in light of their marginal benefit (price is lowered to artificially increase demand), a tax dissuades consumers from a purchase (price is increased to artificially lower demand). This excess burden of taxation represents the lost utility for the consumer. A common example of this is the so-called sin tax, a tax levied against goods deemed harmful to society and individuals. For example, \"sin taxes\" levied against alcohol and tobacco are intended to artificially lower demand for these goods; some would-be users are priced out of the market, i.e. total smoking and drinking are reduced. Products such as alcohol and tobacco have historically been highly taxed and incur excise duties which are one of the categories of indirect tax.\nIndirect tax (VAT), weighs on the consumer, is not a cause of loss of surplus for the producer, but affects consumer utility and leads to deadweight loss for consumers. Indirect taxes are usually paid by large entities such as corporations or manufacturers but are partially shifted towards the consumer. Furthermore, indirect taxes can be charged based on the unit price of a said commodity or can be calculated based on a percentage of the final retail price. Additionally, indirect taxes can either be collected at one stage of the production and retail process or alternatively can be charged and collected at multiple stages of the overall production process of a commodity.\nHarberger's triangle.\nHarberger's triangle, generally attributed to Arnold Harberger, shows the deadweight loss (as measured on a supply and demand graph) associated with government intervention in a perfect market. Mechanisms for this intervention include price floors, caps, taxes, tariffs, or quotas. It also refers to the deadweight loss created by a government's failure to intervene in a market with externalities.\nIn the case of a government tax, the amount of the tax drives a wedge between what consumers pay and what producers receive, and the area of this wedge shape is equivalent to the deadweight loss caused by the tax.\nThe area represented by the triangle results from the fact that the intersection of the supply and the demand curves are cut short. The consumer surplus and the producer surplus are also cut short. The loss of such surplus is never recouped and represents the deadweight loss.\nSome economists like Martin Feldstein maintain that these triangles can seriously affect long-term economic trends by pivoting the trend downwards and causing a magnification of losses in the long run but others like James Tobin have argued that they do not have a huge impact on the economy.\nHicks vs. Marshall.\nThe Hicksian (per John Hicks) and the Marshallian (per Alfred Marshall) demand function differ about deadweight loss. After the consumer surplus is considered, it can be shown that the Marshallian deadweight loss is zero if demand is perfectly elastic or supply is perfectly inelastic. However, Hicks analyzed the situation through indifference curves and noted that when the Marshallian demand curve is perfectly inelastic, the policy or economic situation that caused a distortion in relative prices has a substitution effect, i.e. is a deadweight loss.\nIn modern economic literature, the most common measure of a taxpayer's loss from a distortionary tax, such as a tax on bicycles, is the equivalent variation, the maximum amount that a taxpayer would be willing to forgo in a lump sum to avoid the tax. The deadweight loss can then be interpreted as the difference between the equivalent variation and the revenue raised by the tax. The difference is attributable to the behavioral changes induced by a distortionary tax that are measured by the substitution effect. However, that is not the only interpretation, and Pigou did not use a lump sum tax as the point of reference to discuss deadweight loss (excess burden).\nTaxation.\nWhen a tax is levied on buyers, the demand curve shifts downward in accordance with the size of the tax. Similarly, when tax is levied on sellers, the supply curve shifts upward by the size of tax. When the tax is imposed, the price paid by buyers increases, and the price received by seller decreases. Therefore, buyers and sellers share the burden of the tax, regardless of how it is imposed. Since a tax places a \"wedge\" between the price buyers pay and the price sellers get, the quantity sold is reduced below the level that it would be without tax. To put it another way, a tax on a good causes the size of market for that good to decrease.\nFor example, suppose that Will is a cleaner who is working in the cleaning service company and Amie hired Will to clean her room every week for $100. The opportunity cost of Will's time is $80, while the value of a clean house to Amie is $120. Hence, each of them get same amount of benefit from their deal. Amie and Will each receive a benefit of $20, making the total surplus from trade $40.\nHowever, if the government were to decide to impose a $50 tax upon the providers of cleaning services, their trade would no longer benefit them. Amie would not be willing to pay any price above $120, and Will would no longer receive a payment that exceeds his opportunity cost. As a result, not only do Amie and Will both give up the deal, but Amie has to live in a dirtier house, and Will does not receive his desired income. They have thus lost amount of the surplus that they would have received from their deal, and at the same time, this made each of them worse off to the tune of $40 in value.\nGovernment revenue is also affected by this tax: since Amie and Will have abandoned the deal, the government also loses any tax revenue that would have resulted from wages. This $40 is referred to as the deadweight loss. It causes losses for both buyers and sellers in a market, as well as decreasing government revenues. Taxes cause deadweight losses because they prevent buyers and sellers from realizing some of the gains from trade.\nIn the graph, the deadweight loss can be seen as the shaded area between the supply and demand curves. While the demand curve shows the value of goods to the consumers, the supply curve reflects the cost for producers. As the example above explains, when the government imposes a tax upon taxpayers, the tax increases the price paid by buyers to formula_1 and decreases price received by sellers to formula_2. Buyers and sellers (Amie and Will) give up the deal between them and exit the market. Thus, the quantity sold reduces from formula_3 to formula_4. The deadweight loss occurs because the tax deters these kinds of beneficial trades in the market.\nDeterminants.\nPrice elasticities of supply and demand determine whether the deadweight loss from a tax is large or small. This measures to what extent quantity supplied and quantity demanded respond to changes in price. For instance, when the supply curve is relatively inelastic, quantity supplied responds only minimally to changes in the price. However, when the supply curve is more elastic, quantity supplied responds significantly to changes in price. In other words, when the supply curve is more elastic, the area between the supply and demand curves is larger. Similarly, when the demand curve is relatively inelastic, deadweight loss from the tax is smaller, comparing to more elastic demand curve.\nA tax results in deadweight loss as it causes buyers and sellers to change their behaviour. Buyers tend to consume less when the tax raises the price. When the tax lowers the price received by sellers, they in turn produce less. As a result, the overall size of the market decreases below the optimum equilibrium. The elasticities of supply and demand determine to what extent the tax distorts the market outcome. As the elasticities of supply and demand increase, so does the deadweight loss resulting from a tax.\nVariation based on taxes.\nTaxes may be changed by the government or policymakers at different levels. For instance, when a low tax is levied, the deadweight loss is also small (compared to a medium or high tax). An important consideration is that the deadweight loss resulting from a tax increases \"more quickly\" than the tax itself; the area of the triangle representing the deadweight loss is calculated using the area (square) of its dimension. Where a tax increases linearly, the deadweight loss increases as the square of the tax increase. This means that when the size of a tax doubles, the base and height of the triangle double. Thus, doubling the tax increases the deadweight loss by a factor of 4.\nThe varying deadweight loss from a tax also affects the government's total tax revenue. Tax revenue is represented by the area of the rectangle between the supply and demand curves. When a low tax is levied, tax revenue is relatively small. As the size of the tax increases, tax revenue expands. However, when a much higher tax is levied, tax revenue eventually decreases. The higher tax reduces the total size of the market; Although taxes are taking a larger slice of the \"pie\", the total size of the pie is reduced. Just as in the nail example above, beyond a certain point, the market for a good will eventually decrease to zero.\nMonopolies.\nA deadweight loss occurs with monopolies in the same way that a tax causes deadweight loss. When a monopoly, as a \"tax collector\", charges a price in order to consolidate its power above marginal cost, it drives a \"wedge\" between the costs born by the consumer and supplier. Imposing this effective tax distorts the market outcome, and the wedge causes a decrease in the quantity sold, below the social optimum. It is important to remember the difference between the two cases: whereas the government receives the revenue from a genuine tax, monopoly profits are collected by a private firm.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was used to demonstrate the feasibility of using Unix on a supercomputer system, before Cray-2 hardware was available.\nThe operating system revamp was part of a larger movement inside Cray Research to modernize their corporate software: including rewriting their most important Fortran compiler (cft to cft77) in a higher-level language (Pascal) with more modern optimizations and vectorizations.\nAs a migration path for existing COS customers wishing to transition to UNICOS, a Guest Operating System (GOS) capability was introduced into COS. The only guest OS that was ever supported was UNICOS. A COS batch job would be submitted to start up UNICOS, which would then run as a subsystem under COS, using a subset of the systems CPUs, memory, and peripheral devices. The UNICOS that ran under GOS was exactly the same as when it ran stand-alone: the difference was that the kernel would make certain low-level hardware requests through the COS GOS hook, rather than directly to the hardware.\nOne of the sites that ran very early versions of UNICOS was Bell Labs, where Unix pioneers including Dennis Ritchie ported parts of their Eighth Edition Unix (including STREAMS input/output (I/O)) to UNICOS.

{"id": "47270", "revid": "48974247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47270", "title": "Four Corners Monument", "text": "National monument in the Southwestern United States\nThe Four Corners Monument marks the quadripoint in the Southwestern United States where the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah meet. It is the only point in the United States shared by four states, leading to the area being named the Four Corners region. The monument also marks the boundary between two semi-autonomous Native American governments, the Navajo Nation, which maintains the monument as a tourist attraction, and the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe Reservation.\nThe origins of the state boundaries marked by the monument occurred just prior to, and during, the American Civil War, when the United States Congress acted to form governments in the area to combat the spread of slavery to the region. When the early territories were formed, their boundaries were designated along meridian and parallel lines. Beginning in the 1860s, these lines were surveyed and marked. These early surveys included some errors, but even so, the markers placed became the legal boundaries, superseding the written descriptions of geographical meridians and parallels. This includes the Four Corners Monument, which has been legally established as the corner of the four states.\nMonument.\nThe monument is maintained as a tourist attraction by the Navajo Nation Parks and Recreation Department, Four Corners Monument Navajo Tribal Park. It is an example of a political boundary that is a tourist destination in its own right. The monument consists of a granite disk embedded with a smaller bronze disk around the point, surrounded by smaller, appropriately located state seals and flags representing both the states and tribal nations of the area. Circling the point, starting from Colorado, the disk reads with two words in each state \"Here meet in freedom under God four states\". Around the monument, local Navajo and Ute artisans sell souvenirs and food. An admission fee is required to view and photograph the monument. The monument is a popular tourist attraction despite its remote and isolated location. People travel long distances to take pictures of family and friends at the monument in Twister-like poses, sitting on the disk, in a circle of friends or family around the disk, or for couples to kiss directly over the disk.\nLocation.\nThe monument is located on the Colorado Plateau west of U.S. Highway 160, on State Road 597, approximately southwest of Cortez, Colorado. In addition to the four states, two semi-autonomous American Indian tribal governments have boundaries at the monument, the Navajo Nation and the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe Reservation, with the Ute Mountain tribal boundaries coinciding with Colorado's boundaries at the monument.\nClimate.\nLocated in the Colorado Plateau region of the Southwestern United States, the Four Corners Monument has a strong cold semi-arid climate (BSk) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system. Winters are cold but sunny, while summers are hot and dry. The record high temperature of has been observed five times, on June 19, 29 and 30, 1974, July 14, 2003, and July 21, 2005. The record low temperature of was observed on January 3, 1974.\nHistory.\nThe area now called Four Corners was initially American Indian land, and beginning in the 16th century it was claimed by Spain as part of New Spain. After Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, the area was governed by Mexico until being ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, following the United States' victory in the Mexican\u2013American War.\nThe first boundary which would become part of the monument was set as part of the Compromise of 1850, which created the New Mexico Territory and Utah Territory. The border between the two territories was congressionally defined as the 37th parallel north by the 31st United States Congress. In 1861, the 36th United States Congress transferred land previously allocated to the Utah Territory to the newly created Colorado Territory. The Colorado Territory's southern border would remain as the 37th parallel north, but a new border\u2014between the Colorado and Utah Territories\u2014was declared to be the 32nd meridian west from Washington. This line was derived from the reference used at the time, the Washington meridian.\nIn 1860, just prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War, a group of people in the southern portion of New Mexico Territory passed a resolution condemning the United States for creating such a vast territory with only a single, small government in place at Santa Fe. They claimed that by doing so, the U.S. had ignored the needs of the southern portion, left it without a functional system of law and order, and allowed the situation to deteriorate into a state of chaos and near-anarchy. The group declared secession from the United States and announced their intent to join the Confederate States of America under the name of the Arizona Territory. The U.S. Congress responded in 1863 by creating another Arizona Territory with different but partially overlapping boundaries. The Confederate boundaries split New Mexico along an east\u2013west line, the 34th parallel north, allowing for a single state connection from Texas to the Colorado River. This would give the Confederacy access to California and the Pacific coast. The Union definition split New Mexico along a north-south line, the 32nd meridian west from Washington, which simply extended the boundary between Colorado and Utah southward. The Union plan eventually became reality, and this created the quadripoint at the modern Four Corners. After the split, New Mexico resembled its modern form, with only slight differences.\nSurveying the boundaries.\nAfter the Civil War, efforts began to survey and mark the actual borders. In 1868, the United States General Land Office (GLO) had Ehud N. Darling survey and set markers along the border between the Colorado and New Mexico Territories (the 37th parallel north); this border over time has become known as the \"Darling Line\". In 1875, another GLO surveyor, Chandler Robbins, surveyed and marked the border between the Arizona and New Mexico Territories (the 32nd meridian west of Washington). Robbins began near the Mexico\u2013United States border and worked his way north, marking the border every so often. Near the 37th parallel north, he intersected the Darling Line, and here he erected a sandstone shaft. This sandstone shaft marked today's location of the Four Corners Monument.\nIn 1878, Rollin J. Reeves surveyed and marked the border between the newly created State of Colorado and the Utah Territory. Reeves located the sandstone shaft marker placed by Robbins at today's Four Corners Monument. He then began to survey and mark the border between Colorado and Utah from this point northward. In 1901, Howard B. Carpenter surveyed and marked the border between Arizona and Utah, completing the survey of borders making up the Four Corners Monument.\nThe results of these surveys and the markers placed were later accepted as the legal boundaries between the various states.\nDevelopment into a monument.\nBy 1899, the sandstone shaft marker placed by Chandler Robbins in 1875 had been disturbed and broken, so it was replaced with a new stone by two U.S. surveyors, Hubert D. Page and James M. Lentz. In 1912, a simple concrete pad was poured around the marker. The first modern Navajo government convened in 1923 in an effort to organize and regulate an increasing amount of oil exploration activities on Navajo lands, and they played a significant role in the monument's further development.\nIn 1931, Everett H. Kimmell, another U.S. surveyor, found this newer stone had broken too, and he replaced it with a brass disc marker set in concrete. In 1962, the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Indian Affairs poured an elevated concrete pad around the 1931 brass marker; this pad included the state border lines and names in tile. The monument was rebuilt in 1992, and the 1931 brass marker was replaced with a disc-shaped aluminum-bronze plate set in granite. The monument was again rebuilt in 2010, although the disc-shaped plate from 1992 remained in place.\nMisplacement controversy.\nSince the early 20th century, controversies have arisen regarding the accuracy of the monument's placement. After the initial surveys, it was found that the borders did not always follow the lines of meridian and parallel (as had been intended) due to the primitive surveying technology available at the time. This discrepancy left the four states asking if the correct borders were the exact lines of meridian and parallel (and if new, more accurate, surveys needed to be done), or if the markers placed during the initial surveys were now the actual border.\nNew Mexico sued Colorado in 1919, and when the Supreme Court in 1925 ruled that the markers placed during the initial surveys were the actual borders, even if the markers were off in some locations (including the Four Corners Monument and the Preston Monument to the east), the issue was resolved. Today's legal description of these border lines is based on the original markers, and not the written description of the borders created when the territories were formed. Because of this, the borders between these states are not perfectly straight and often zigzag.\nOne example is the border between Colorado and Utah, where in one area the border jogs west about from where it was intended to be placed by the written description (i.e. the 32nd meridian west from Washington \u2013 ). Because of the Supreme Court decision, the border set out by the markers remains the border between the two states.\nThis issue resurfaced briefly in 2009 with U.S. media reports that the monument was placed west of its intended location. This was soon found to be the result of a mistaken assumption: that the Prime Meridian, used in the United States since 1912, was used. In actuality, the 19th century surveys used the previous Washington meridian. A spokesperson for the U.S. National Geodetic Survey (USNGS) has stated that the USNGS has determined that the modern monument is located roughly east of where the Four Corners marker had originally been intended to be located by the US Congress in 1863. The spokesperson, however, reiterated that the 1875 survey was accepted by all states and therefore its markers, including the Four Corners Monument, are legally binding. Similar statements were issued by the Navajo Nation, defending their work in maintaining and promoting the monument.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are sessile filter feeders that are bound to the seabed, and are one of the most ancient members of macrobenthos, with many historical species being important reef-building organisms.\nSponges are multicellular organisms consisting of jelly-like mesohyl sandwiched between two thin layers of cells, and usually have tube-like bodies full of pores and channels that allow water to circulate through them. They have unspecialized cells that can transform into other types and that often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. They do not have complex nervous, digestive or circulatory systems. Instead, most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes, usually via flagella movements of the so-called \"collar cells\".\nSponges are believed to have been the first outgroup to branch off the evolutionary tree from the last common ancestor of all animals, with fossil evidence of primitive sponges such as \"Otavia\" from as early as the Tonian period (around 800\u00a0Mya). The branch of zoology that studies sponges is spongiology.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nThe term \"sponge\" derives from the Ancient Greek word . The scientific name \"Porifera\" is a neuter plural of the Modern Latin term \"porifer\", which comes from the roots \"porus\" meaning \"pore, opening\", and \"-fer\" meaning \"bearing or carrying\".\nOverview.\nSponges are similar to other animals in that they are multicellular, heterotrophic, lack cell walls and produce sperm cells. Unlike other animals, they lack true tissues and organs. Some of them are radially symmetrical, but most are asymmetrical. The shapes of their bodies are adapted for maximal efficiency of water flow through the central cavity, where the water deposits nutrients and then leaves through a hole called the osculum. The single-celled choanoflagellates resemble the choanocyte cells of sponges which are used to drive their water flow systems and capture most of their food. This along with phylogenetic studies of ribosomal molecules have been used as morphological evidence to suggest sponges are the sister group to the rest of animals. A great majority are marine (salt-water) species, ranging in habitat from tidal zones to depths exceeding , though there are freshwater species. All adult sponges are sessile, meaning that they attach to an underwater surface and remain fixed in place (i.e., do not travel). While in their larval stage of life, they are motile.\nMany sponges have internal skeletons of spicules (skeletal-like fragments of calcium carbonate or silicon dioxide), and/or spongin (a modified type of collagen protein). An internal gelatinous matrix called mesohyl functions as an endoskeleton, and it is the only skeleton in soft sponges that encrust such hard surfaces as rocks. More commonly, the mesohyl is stiffened by mineral spicules, by spongin fibers, or both. Most sponges (over 90% of all known species) are demosponges, which have the widest range of habitats (including all freshwater ones); they use spongin, silica spicules, or both, and some species have calcium carbonate exoskeletons. Calcareans have calcium carbonate spicules and, in some species, calcium carbonate exoskeletons; they are restricted to relatively shallow marine waters where production of calcium carbonate is easiest. The fragile hexactinellids or glass sponges use \"scaffolding\" of silica spicules and are restricted to polar regions or ocean depths where predators are rare. Fossils of all of these types have been found in rocks dated from https://\u00a0million years ago. In addition Archaeocyathids, whose fossils are common in rocks from https:// 490, are now regarded as a type of sponge. The smallest class of extant sponges are homoscleromorphs, which either have calcium carbonate spicules like the calcereans or are aspiculate, and found in shaded marine environments like caves and overhangs.\nAlthough most of the approximately 5,000\u201310,000\u00a0known species of sponges feed on bacteria and other microscopic food in the water, some host photosynthesizing microorganisms as endosymbionts, and these alliances often produce more food and oxygen than they consume. A few species of sponges that live in food-poor environments have evolved as carnivores that prey mainly on small crustaceans.\nMost sponges reproduce sexually, but they can also reproduce asexually. Sexually reproducing species release sperm cells into the water to fertilize ova released or retained by its mate or \"mother\"; the fertilized eggs develop into larvae which swim off in search of places to settle. Sponges are known for regenerating from fragments that are broken off, although this only works if the fragments include the right types of cells. Some species reproduce by budding. When environmental conditions become less hospitable to the sponges, for example as temperatures drop, many freshwater species and a few marine ones produce gemmules, \"survival pods\" of unspecialized cells that remain dormant until conditions improve; they then either form completely new sponges or recolonize the skeletons of their parents.\nThe few species of demosponge that have entirely soft fibrous skeletons with no hard elements have been used by humans over thousands of years for several purposes, including as padding and as cleaning tools. By the 1950s, though, these had been overfished so heavily that the industry almost collapsed, and most sponge-like materials are now synthetic. Sponges and their microscopic endosymbionts are now being researched as possible sources of medicines for treating a wide range of diseases. Dolphins have been observed using sponges as tools while foraging.\nDistinguishing features.\nSponges constitute the phylum Porifera, and have been defined as sessile metazoans (multicelled immobile animals) that have water intake and outlet openings connected by chambers lined with choanocytes, cells with whip-like flagella. However, a few carnivorous sponges have lost these water flow systems and the choanocytes. All known living sponges can remold their bodies, as most types of their cells can move within their bodies and a few can change from one type to another.\nEven if a few sponges are able to produce mucus \u2013 which acts as a microbial barrier in all other animals \u2013 no sponge with the ability to secrete a functional mucus layer has been recorded. Without such a mucus layer their living tissue is covered by a layer of microbial symbionts, which can contribute up to 40\u201350% of the sponge wet mass. This inability to prevent microbes from penetrating their porous tissue could be a major reason why they have never evolved a more complex anatomy.\nLike cnidarians (jellyfish, etc.) and ctenophores (comb jellies), and unlike all other known metazoans, sponges' bodies consist of a non-living jelly-like mass (mesohyl) sandwiched between two main layers of cells. Cnidarians and ctenophores have simple nervous systems, and their cell layers are bound by internal connections and by being mounted on a basement membrane (thin fibrous mat, also known as \"basal lamina\"). Sponges do not have a nervous system similar to that of vertebrates but may have one that is quite different. Their middle jelly-like layers have large and varied populations of cells, and some types of cells in their outer layers may move into the middle layer and change their functions.\nBasic structure.\nCell types.\n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mesohyl\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pinacocyte\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choanocyte\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lophocyte\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Porocyte\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oocyte\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Archeocyte\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sclerocyte\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Spicule\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Water flow\nMain cell types of Porifera\nA sponge's body is hollow and is held in shape by the mesohyl, a jelly-like substance made mainly of collagen and reinforced by a dense network of fibers also made of collagen. 18 distinct cell types have been identified. The inner surface is covered with choanocytes, cells with cylindrical or conical collars surrounding one flagellum per choanocyte. The wave-like motion of the whip-like flagella drives water through the sponge's body. All sponges have ostia, channels leading to the interior through the mesohyl, and in most sponges these are controlled by tube-like porocytes that form closable inlet valves. Pinacocytes, plate-like cells, form a single-layered external skin over all other parts of the mesohyl that are not covered by choanocytes, and the pinacocytes also digest food particles that are too large to enter the ostia, while those at the base of the animal are responsible for anchoring it.\nOther types of cells live and move within the mesohyl:\nMany larval sponges possess neuron-less eyes that are based on cryptochromes. They mediate phototaxic behavior.\nGlass sponges present a distinctive variation on this basic plan. Their spicules, which are made of silica, form a scaffolding-like framework between whose rods the living tissue is suspended like a cobweb that contains most of the cell types. This tissue is a syncytium that in some ways behaves like many cells that share a single external membrane, and in others like a single cell with multiple nuclei.\nWater flow and body structures.\nAsconoid\nSyconoid\nLeuconoid\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pinacocytes\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Choanocytes\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mesohyl\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Water flow\nPorifera body structures \nMost sponges work rather like chimneys: they take in water at the bottom and eject it from the osculum at the top. Since ambient currents are faster at the top, the suction effect that they produce by Bernoulli's principle does some of the work for free. Sponges can control the water flow by various combinations of wholly or partially closing the osculum and ostia (the intake pores) and varying the beat of the flagella, and may shut it down if there is a lot of sand or silt in the water.\nAlthough the layers of pinacocytes and choanocytes resemble the epithelia of more complex animals, they are not bound tightly by cell-to-cell connections or a basal lamina (thin fibrous sheet underneath). The flexibility of these layers and re-modeling of the mesohyl by lophocytes allow the animals to adjust their shapes throughout their lives to take maximum advantage of local water currents.\nThe simplest body structure in sponges is a tube or vase shape known as \"asconoid\", but this severely limits the size of the animal. The body structure is characterized by a stalk-like spongocoel surrounded by a single layer of choanocytes. If it is simply scaled up, the ratio of its volume to surface area increases, because surface increases as the square of length or width while volume increases proportionally to the cube. The amount of tissue that needs food and oxygen is determined by the volume, but the pumping capacity that supplies food and oxygen depends on the area covered by choanocytes. Asconoid sponges seldom exceed in diameter.\nSome sponges overcome this limitation by adopting the \"syconoid\" structure, in which the body wall is pleated. The inner pockets of the pleats are lined with choanocytes, which connect to the outer pockets of the pleats by ostia. This increase in the number of choanocytes and hence in pumping capacity enables syconoid sponges to grow up to a few centimeters in diameter.\nThe \"leuconoid\" pattern boosts pumping capacity further by filling the interior almost completely with mesohyl that contains a network of chambers lined with choanocytes and connected to each other and to the water intakes and outlet by tubes. Leuconid sponges grow to over in diameter, and the fact that growth in any direction increases the number of choanocyte chambers enables them to take a wider range of forms, for example, \"encrusting\" sponges whose shapes follow those of the surfaces to which they attach. All freshwater and most shallow-water marine sponges have leuconid bodies. The networks of water passages in glass sponges are similar to the leuconid structure.\nIn all three types of structure, the cross-section area of the choanocyte-lined regions is much greater than that of the intake and outlet channels. This makes the flow slower near the choanocytes and thus makes it easier for them to trap food particles. For example, in \"Leuconia\", a small leuconoid sponge about tall and in diameter, water enters each of more than 80,000 intake canals at 6\u00a0cm per \"minute\". However, because \"Leuconia\" has more than 2\u00a0million flagellated chambers whose combined diameter is much greater than that of the canals, water flow through chambers slows to 3.6\u00a0cm per \"hour\", making it easy for choanocytes to capture food. All the water is expelled through a single osculum at about 8.5\u00a0cm per \"second\", fast enough to carry waste products some distance away.\nSkeleton.\nIn zoology, a skeleton is any fairly rigid structure of an animal, irrespective of whether it has joints and irrespective of whether it is biomineralized. The mesohyl functions as an endoskeleton in most sponges, and is the only skeleton in soft sponges that encrust hard surfaces such as rocks. More commonly the mesohyl is stiffened by mineral spicules, by spongin fibers or both. Spicules, which are present in most but not all species, may be made of silica or calcium carbonate, and vary in shape from simple rods to three-dimensional \"stars\" with up to six rays. Spicules are produced by sclerocyte cells, and may be separate, connected by joints, or fused.\nSome sponges also secrete exoskeletons that lie completely outside their organic components. For example, sclerosponges (\"hard sponges\") have massive calcium carbonate exoskeletons over which the organic matter forms a thin layer with choanocyte chambers in pits in the mineral. These exoskeletons are secreted by the pinacocytes that form the animals' skins.\nVital functions.\nMovement.\nAlthough adult sponges are fundamentally sessile animals, some marine and freshwater species can move across the sea bed at speeds of per day, as a result of amoeba-like movements of pinacocytes and other cells. A few species can contract their whole bodies, and many can close their oscula and ostia. Juveniles drift or swim freely, while adults are stationary.\nRespiration, feeding and excretion.\nSponges do not have distinct circulatory, respiratory, digestive, and excretory systems \u2013 instead, the water flow system supports all these functions. They filter food particles out of the water flowing through them. Particles larger than 50\u00a0micrometers cannot enter the ostia and pinacocytes consume them by phagocytosis (engulfing and intracellular digestion). Particles from 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm to 50\u00a0\u03bcm are trapped in the ostia, which taper from the outer to inner ends. These particles are consumed by pinacocytes or by archaeocytes which partially extrude themselves through the walls of the ostia. Bacteria-sized particles, below 0.5\u00a0micrometers, pass through the ostia and are caught and consumed by choanocytes. Since the smallest particles are by far the most common, choanocytes typically capture 80% of a sponge's food supply. Archaeocytes transport food packaged in vesicles from cells that directly digest food to those that do not. At least one species of sponge has internal fibers that function as tracks for use by nutrient-carrying archaeocytes, and these tracks also move inert objects.\nIt used to be claimed that glass sponges could live on nutrients dissolved in sea water and were very averse to silt. However, a study in 2007 found no evidence of this and concluded that they extract bacteria and other micro-organisms from water very efficiently (about 79%) and process suspended sediment grains to extract such prey. Collar bodies digest food and distribute it wrapped in vesicles that are transported by dynein \"motor\" molecules along bundles of microtubules that run throughout the syncytium.\nSponges' cells absorb oxygen by diffusion from water into cells as water flows through body, into which carbon dioxide and other soluble waste products such as ammonia also diffuse. Archeocytes remove mineral particles that threaten to block the ostia, transport them through the mesohyl and generally dump them into the outgoing water current, although some species incorporate them into their skeletons.\nCarnivorous sponges.\nIn waters where the supply of food particles is very poor, some species prey on crustaceans and other small animals. As of 2014, a total of 137 species had been discovered. Most belong to the family Cladorhizidae, but a few members of the Guitarridae and Esperiopsidae are also carnivores. In most cases, little is known about how they actually capture prey, although some species are thought to use either sticky threads or hooked spicules. Most carnivorous sponges live in deep waters, up to , and the development of deep-ocean exploration techniques is expected to lead to the discovery of several more. However, one species has been found in Mediterranean caves at depths of , alongside the more usual filter-feeding sponges. The cave-dwelling predators capture crustaceans under long by entangling them with fine threads, digest them by enveloping them with further threads over the course of a few days, and then return to their normal shape; there is no evidence that they use venom.\nMost known carnivorous sponges have completely lost the water flow system and choanocytes. However, the genus \"Chondrocladia\" uses a highly modified water flow system to inflate balloon-like structures that are used for capturing prey.\nEndosymbionts.\nFreshwater sponges often host green algae as endosymbionts within archaeocytes and other cells and benefit from nutrients produced by the algae. Many marine species host other photosynthesizing organisms, most commonly cyanobacteria but in some cases dinoflagellates. Symbiotic cyanobacteria may form a third of the total mass of living tissue in some sponges, and some sponges gain 48% to 80% of their energy supply from these micro-organisms. In 2008, a University of Stuttgart team reported that spicules made of silica conduct light into the mesohyl, where the photosynthesizing endosymbionts live. Sponges that host photosynthesizing organisms are most common in waters with relatively poor supplies of food particles and often have leafy shapes that maximize the amount of sunlight they collect.\nA recently discovered carnivorous sponge that lives near hydrothermal vents hosts methane-eating bacteria and digests some of them.\n\"Immune\" system.\nSponges do not have the complex immune systems of most other animals. However, they reject grafts from other species but accept them from other members of their own species. In a few marine species, gray cells play the leading role in rejection of foreign material. When invaded, they produce a chemical that stops movement of other cells in the affected area, thus preventing the intruder from using the sponge's internal transport systems. If the intrusion persists, the grey cells concentrate in the area and release toxins that kill all cells in the area. The \"immune\" system can stay in this activated state for up to three weeks.\nReproduction.\nAsexual.\nSponges have three asexual methods of reproduction: after fragmentation, by budding, and by producing gemmules. Fragments of sponges may be detached by currents or waves. They use the mobility of their pinacocytes and choanocytes and reshaping of the mesohyl to re-attach themselves to a suitable surface and then rebuild themselves as small but functional sponges over the course of several days. The same capabilities enable sponges that have been squeezed through a fine cloth to regenerate. A sponge fragment can only regenerate if it contains both collencytes to produce mesohyl and archeocytes to produce all the other cell types. A very few species reproduce by budding.\nGemmules are \"survival pods\" which a few marine sponges and many freshwater species produce by the thousands when dying and which some, mainly freshwater species, regularly produce in autumn. Spongocytes make gemmules by wrapping shells of spongin, often reinforced with spicules, round clusters of archeocytes that are full of nutrients. Freshwater gemmules may also include photosynthesizing symbionts. The gemmules then become dormant, and in this state can survive cold, drying out, lack of oxygen and extreme variations in salinity. Freshwater gemmules often do not revive until the temperature drops, stays cold for a few months and then reaches a near-\"normal\" level. When a gemmule germinates, the archeocytes round the outside of the cluster transform into pinacocytes, a membrane over a pore in the shell bursts, the cluster of cells slowly emerges, and most of the remaining archeocytes transform into other cell types needed to make a functioning sponge. Gemmules from the same species but different individuals can join forces to form one sponge. Some gemmules are retained within the parent sponge, and in spring it can be difficult to tell whether an old sponge has revived or been \"recolonized\" by its own gemmules.\nSexual.\nMost sponges are hermaphrodites (function as both sexes simultaneously), although sponges have no gonads (reproductive organs). Sperm are produced by choanocytes or entire choanocyte chambers that sink into the mesohyl and form spermatic cysts while eggs are formed by transformation of archeocytes, or of choanocytes in some species. Each egg generally acquires a yolk by consuming \"nurse cells\". During spawning, sperm burst out of their cysts and are expelled via the osculum. If they contact another sponge of the same species, the water flow carries them to choanocytes that engulf them but, instead of digesting them, metamorphose to an ameboid form and carry the sperm through the mesohyl to eggs, which in most cases engulf the carrier and its cargo.\nA few species release fertilized eggs into the water, but most retain the eggs until they hatch. By retaining the eggs, the parents can transfer symbiotic microorganisms directly to their offspring through vertical transmission, while the species who release their eggs into the water has to acquire symbionts horizontally (a combination of both is probably most common, where larvae with vertically transmitted symbionts also acquire others horizontally). There are four types of larvae, but all are lecithotrophic (non-feeding) balls of cells with an outer layer of cells whose flagella or cilia enable the larvae to move. After swimming for a few days the larvae sink and crawl until they find a place to settle. Most of the cells transform into archeocytes and then into the types appropriate for their locations in a miniature adult sponge.\nGlass sponge embryos start by dividing into separate cells, but once 32\u00a0cells have formed they rapidly transform into larvae that externally are ovoid with a band of cilia round the middle that they use for movement, but internally have the typical glass sponge structure of spicules with a cobweb-like main syncitium draped around and between them and choanosyncytia with multiple collar bodies in the center. The larvae then leave their parents' bodies.\nMeiosis.\nThe cytological progression of porifera oogenesis and spermatogenesis (gametogenesis) is very similar to that of other metazoa. Most of the genes from the classic set of meiotic genes, including genes for DNA recombination and double-strand break repair, that are conserved in eukaryotes are expressed in the sponges (e.g. \"Geodia hentscheli\" and \"Geodia phlegraei\"). Since porifera are considered to be the earliest divergent animals, these findings indicate that the basic toolkit of meiosis including capabilities for recombination and DNA repair were present early in eukaryote evolution.\nLife cycle.\nSponges in temperate regions live for at most a few years, but some tropical species and perhaps some deep-ocean ones may live for 200\u00a0years or more. Some calcified demosponges grow by only per year and, if that rate is constant, specimens wide must be about 5,000\u00a0years old. Some sponges start sexual reproduction when only a few weeks old, while others wait until they are several years old.\nCoordination of activities.\nAdult sponges lack neurons or any other kind of nervous tissue. However, most species have the ability to perform movements that are coordinated all over their bodies, mainly contractions of the pinacocytes, squeezing the water channels and thus expelling excess sediment and other substances that may cause blockages. Some species can contract the osculum independently of the rest of the body. Sponges may also contract in order to reduce the area that is vulnerable to attack by predators. In cases where two sponges are fused, for example if there is a large but still unseparated bud, these contraction waves slowly become coordinated in both of the \"Siamese twins\". The coordinating mechanism is unknown, but may involve chemicals similar to neurotransmitters. However, glass sponges rapidly transmit electrical impulses through all parts of the syncytium, and use this to halt the motion of their flagella if the incoming water contains toxins or excessive sediment. Myocytes are thought to be responsible for closing the osculum and for transmitting signals between different parts of the body.\nSponges contain genes very similar to those that contain the \"recipe\" for the post-synaptic density, an important signal-receiving structure in the neurons of all other animals. However, in sponges these genes are only activated in \"flask cells\" that appear only in larvae and may provide some sensory capability while the larvae are swimming. This raises questions about whether flask cells represent the predecessors of true neurons or are evidence that sponges' ancestors had true neurons but lost them as they adapted to a sessile lifestyle.\nEcology.\nHabitats.\nSponges are worldwide in their distribution, living in a wide range of ocean habitats, from the polar regions to the tropics. Most live in quiet, clear waters, because sediment stirred up by waves or currents would block their pores, making it difficult for them to feed and breathe. The greatest numbers of sponges are usually found on firm surfaces such as rocks, but some sponges can attach themselves to soft sediment by means of a root-like base.\nSponges are more abundant but less diverse in temperate waters than in tropical waters, possibly because organisms that prey on sponges are more abundant in tropical waters. Glass sponges are the most common in polar waters and in the depths of temperate and tropical seas, as their very porous construction enables them to extract food from these resource-poor waters with the minimum of effort. Demosponges and calcareous sponges are abundant and diverse in shallower non-polar waters.\nThe different classes of sponge live in different ranges of habitat:\nAs primary producers.\nSponges with photosynthesizing endosymbionts produce up to three times more oxygen than they consume, as well as more organic matter than they consume. Such contributions to their habitats' resources are significant along Australia's Great Barrier Reef but relatively minor in the Caribbean.\nDefenses.\nMany sponges shed spicules, forming a dense carpet several meters deep that keeps away echinoderms which would otherwise prey on the sponges. They also produce toxins that prevent other sessile organisms such as bryozoans or sea squirts from growing on or near them, making sponges very effective competitors for living space. One of many examples includes ageliferin, which has antibacterial action and causes biofilms to dissolve.\nA few species, including the Caribbean fire sponge \"Tedania ignis\", cause a severe rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and some fish feed mainly on sponges. It is often said that sponges produce chemical defenses against such predators. However, experiments have been unable to establish a relationship between the toxicity of chemicals produced by sponges and how they taste to fish, which would diminish the usefulness of chemical defenses as deterrents. Predation by fish may even help to spread sponges by detaching fragments. However, some studies have shown fish showing a preference for non-chemically-defended sponges, and another study found that high levels of coral predation did predict the presence of chemically defended species.\nGlass sponges produce no toxic chemicals, and live in very deep water where predators are rare.\nPredation.\nSpongeflies, also known as spongillaflies (Neuroptera, Sisyridae), are specialist predators of freshwater sponges. The female lays her eggs on vegetation overhanging water. The larvae hatch and drop into the water where they seek out sponges to feed on. They use their elongated mouthparts to pierce the sponge and suck the fluids within. The larvae of some species cling to the surface of the sponge while others take refuge in the sponge's internal cavities. The fully grown larvae leave the water and spin a cocoon in which to pupate.\nBioerosion.\nThe Caribbean chicken-liver sponge \"Chondrilla nucula\" secretes toxins that kill coral polyps, allowing the sponges to grow over the coral skeletons. Others, especially in the family Clionaidae, use corrosive substances secreted by their archeocytes to tunnel into rocks, corals and the shells of dead mollusks. Sponges may remove up to per year from reefs, creating visible notches just below low-tide level.\nDiseases.\nCaribbean sponges of the genus \"Aplysina\" suffer from Aplysina red band syndrome. This causes \"Aplysina\" to develop one or more rust-colored bands, sometimes with adjacent bands of necrotic tissue. These lesions may completely encircle branches of the sponge. The disease appears to be contagious and impacts approximately ten percent of \"A. cauliformis\" on Bahamian reefs. The rust-colored bands are caused by a cyanobacterium, but it is unknown whether this organism actually causes the disease.\nCollaboration with other organisms.\nIn addition to hosting photosynthesizing endosymbionts, sponges are noted for their wide range of collaborations with other organisms. The relatively large encrusting sponge \"Lissodendoryx colombiensis\" is most common on rocky surfaces, but has extended its range into seagrass meadows by letting itself be surrounded or overgrown by seagrass sponges, which are distasteful to the local starfish and therefore protect \"Lissodendoryx\" against them; in return, the seagrass sponges get higher positions away from the sea-floor sediment.\nShrimps of the genus \"Synalpheus\" form colonies in sponges, and each shrimp species inhabits a different sponge species, making \"Synalpheus\" one of the most diverse crustacean genera. Specifically, Synalpheus regalis utilizes the sponge not only as a food source, but also as a defense against other shrimp and predators. As many as 16,000 individuals inhabit a single loggerhead sponge, feeding off the larger particles that collect on the sponge as it filters the ocean to feed itself. Other crustaceans such as hermit crabs commonly have a specific species of sponge, \"Pseudospongosorites\", grow on them as both the sponge and crab occupy gastropod shells until the crab and sponge outgrow the shell, eventually resulting in the crab using the sponge's body as protection instead of the shell until the crab finds a suitable replacement shell.\nSponge loop.\nMost sponges are detritivores which filter organic debris particles and microscopic life forms from ocean water. In particular, sponges occupy an important role as detritivores in coral reef food webs by recycling detritus to higher trophic levels.\nThe hypothesis has been made that coral reef sponges facilitate the transfer of coral-derived organic matter to their associated detritivores via the production of sponge detritus, as shown in the diagram. Several sponge species are able to convert coral-derived DOM into sponge detritus, and transfer organic matter produced by corals further up the reef food web. Corals release organic matter as both dissolved and particulate mucus, as well as cellular material such as expelled \"Symbiodinium\".\nOrganic matter could be transferred from corals to sponges by all these pathways, but DOM likely makes up the largest fraction, as the majority (56 to 80%) of coral mucus dissolves in the water column, and coral loss of fixed carbon due to expulsion of \"Symbiodinium\" is typically negligible (0.01%) compared with mucus release (up to ~40%). Coral-derived organic matter could also be indirectly transferred to sponges via bacteria, which can also consume coral mucus.\nSponge microbiome.\nBesides a one to one symbiotic relationship, it is possible for a host to become symbiotic with a microbial consortium, resulting in a diverse sponge microbiome. Sponges are able to host a wide range of microbial communities that can also be very specific. The microbial communities that form a symbiotic relationship with the sponge can amount to as much as 35% of the biomass of its host.\nThe term for this specific symbiotic relationship, where a microbial consortia pairs with a host is called a holobiotic relationship. The sponge as well as the microbial community associated with it will produce a large range of secondary metabolites that help protect it against predators through mechanisms such as chemical defense. The sponge holobiont is an example of the concept of nested ecosystems. Environmental factors act at multiple scales to alter microbiome, holobiont, community, and ecosystem scale processes. Thus, factors that alter microbiome functioning can lead to changes at the holobiont, community, or even ecosystem level and vice versa, illustrating the necessity of considering multiple scales when evaluating functioning in nested ecosystems.\nSome of these relationships include endosymbionts within bacteriocyte cells, and cyanobacteria or microalgae found below the pinacoderm cell layer where they are able to receive the highest amount of light, used for phototrophy. They can host over 50 different microbial phyla and candidate phyla, including Alphaprotoebacteria, Actinomycetota, Chloroflexota, Nitrospirota, \"Cyanobacteria\", the taxa Gamma-, the candidate phylum Poribacteria, and Thaumarchaea.\nSystematics.\nTaxonomy.\nCarl Linnaeus, who classified most kinds of sessile animals as belonging to the order Zoophyta in the class Vermes, mistakenly identified the genus \"Spongia\" as plants in the order Algae. For a long time thereafter, sponges were assigned to subkingdom Parazoa (\"beside the animals\") separated from the Eumetazoa which formed the rest of the kingdom Animalia.\nThe phylum Porifera is further divided into classes mainly according to the composition of their skeletons:\nIn the 1970s, sponges with massive calcium carbonate skeletons were assigned to a separate class, Sclerospongiae, otherwise known as \"coralline sponges\". However, in the 1980s, it was found that these were all members of either the Calcarea or the Demospongiae.\nSo far scientific publications have identified about 9,000 poriferan species, of which about 400 are glass sponges, about 500 are calcareous species, and the rest are demosponges. However, some types of habitat, such as vertical rock and cave walls and galleries in rock and coral boulders, have been investigated very little, even in shallow seas, and may harbor many more species.\nClasses.\nSponges were traditionally distributed in three classes: calcareous sponges (Calcarea), glass sponges (Hexactinellida) and demosponges (Demospongiae). However, studies have now shown that the Homoscleromorpha, a group thought to belong to the Demospongiae, has a genetic relationship well separated from other sponge classes. Therefore, they have recently been recognized as the fourth class of sponges.\nSponges are divided into classes mainly according to the composition of their skeletons: These are arranged in evolutionary order as shown below in ascending order of their evolution from top to bottom:\nPhylogeny.\nThe phylogeny of sponges has been debated heavily since the advent of phylogenetics. Originally thought to be the most basal animal phylum, there is now considerable evidence that Ctenophora may hold that title instead. Additionally, the monophyly of the phylum is now under question. Several studies have concluded that all other animals emerged from within the sponges, and usually recover that the calcareous sponges and Homoscleromorpha are closer to other animals than to demosponges. The internal relationships of Porifera have proven to be less uncertain. A close relationship of Homoscleromorpha and Calcarea has been recovered in nearly all studies, whether or not they support sponge or eumetazoan monophyly. The position of glass sponges is also fairly certain, with a majority of studies recovering them as the sister of the demosponges. Thus, the uncertainty at the base of the animal family tree is probably best represented by the below cladogram.\nEvolutionary history.\nFossil record.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n1:\u00a0Gap\u00a0 2:\u00a0Central\u00a0cavity\u00a0 3\u00a0Internal wall\u00a0 4:\u00a0Pore (\"all\" walls have pores)\u00a0 5\u00a0Septum\u00a0 6\u00a0Outer wall\u00a0 7\u00a0Holdfast\nArchaeocyathid structure\nAlthough molecular clocks and biomarkers suggest sponges existed well before the Cambrian explosion of life, silica spicules like those of demosponges are absent from the fossil record until the Cambrian. An unsubstantiated 2002 report exists of spicules in rocks dated around https://\u00a0million years ago. Well-preserved fossil sponges from about https://\u00a0million years ago in the Ediacaran period have been found in the Doushantuo Formation. These fossils, which include: spicules; pinacocytes; porocytes; archeocytes; sclerocytes; and the internal cavity, have been classified as demosponges. The Ediacaran record of sponges also contains two other genera: the stem-hexactinellid \"Helicolocellus\" from the Dengying Formation and the possible stem-archaeocyathan \"Arimasia\" from the Nama Group. These genera are both from the \"Nama assemblage\" of Ediacaran biota, although whether this is due to a genuine lack beforehand or preservational bias is uncertain. Fossils of glass sponges have been found from around https://\u00a0million years ago in rocks in Australia, China, and Mongolia. Early Cambrian sponges from Mexico belonging to the genus \"Kiwetinokia\" show evidence of fusion of several smaller spicules to form a single large spicule. Calcium carbonate spicules of calcareous sponges have been found in Early Cambrian rocks from about https:// 523 in Australia. Other probable demosponges have been found in the Early Cambrian Chengjiang fauna, from https:// 520. Fossils found in the Canadian Northwest Territories dating to https://\u00a0million years ago may be sponges; if this finding is confirmed, it suggests the first animals appeared before the Neoproterozoic oxygenation event.\nFreshwater sponges appear to be much younger, as the earliest known fossils date from the Mid-Eocene period about https:// 40. Although about 90% of modern sponges are demosponges, fossilized remains of this type are less common than those of other types because their skeletons are composed of relatively soft spongin that does not fossilize well.\nThe earliest sponge symbionts are known from the early Silurian.\nA chemical tracer is 24-isopropyl cholestane, which is a stable derivative of 24-isopropyl cholesterol, which is said to be produced by demosponges but not by eumetazoans (\"true animals\", i.e. cnidarians and bilaterians). Since choanoflagellates are thought to be animals' closest single-celled relatives, a team of scientists examined the biochemistry and genes of one choanoflagellate species. They concluded that this species could not produce 24-isopropyl cholesterol but that investigation of a wider range of choanoflagellates would be necessary in order to prove that the fossil 24-isopropyl cholestane could only have been produced by demosponges.\nAlthough a previous publication reported traces of the chemical 24-isopropyl cholestane in ancient rocks dating to https://\u00a0million years ago, recent research using a much more accurately dated rock series has revealed that these biomarkers only appear before the end of the Marinoan glaciation approximately https://\u00a0million years ago, and that \"Biomarker analysis has yet to reveal any convincing evidence for ancient sponges pre-dating the first globally extensive Neoproterozoic glacial episode (the Sturtian, ~https://\u00a0million years ago in Oman)\". While it has been argued that this 'sponge biomarker' could have originated from marine algae, recent research suggests that the algae's ability to produce this biomarker evolved only in the Carboniferous; as such, the biomarker remains strongly supportive of the presence of demosponges in the Cryogenian.\nArchaeocyathids, which some classify as a type of coralline sponge, are very common fossils in rocks from the Early Cambrian about https:// 520, but apparently died out by the end of the Cambrian https://\u00a0million years ago.\nIt has been suggested that they were produced by: sponges; cnidarians; algae; foraminiferans; a completely separate phylum of animals, Archaeocyatha; or even a completely separate kingdom of life, labeled Archaeata or Inferibionta. Since the 1990s, archaeocyathids have been regarded as a distinctive group of sponges.\n skin\n aragonite\n flesh\nHalkieriid sclerite structure \nIt is difficult to fit chancelloriids into classifications of sponges or more complex animals. An analysis in 1996 concluded that they were closely related to sponges on the grounds that the detailed structure of chancellorid sclerites (\"armor plates\") is similar to that of fibers of spongin, a collagen protein, in modern keratose (horny) demosponges such as \"Darwinella\". However, another analysis in 2002 concluded that chancelloriids are not sponges and may be intermediate between sponges and more complex animals, among other reasons because their skins were thicker and more tightly connected than those of sponges. In 2008, a detailed analysis of chancelloriids' sclerites concluded that they were very similar to those of halkieriids, mobile bilaterian animals that looked like slugs in chain mail and whose fossils are found in rocks from the very Early Cambrian to the Mid Cambrian. If this is correct, it would create a dilemma, as it is extremely unlikely that totally unrelated organisms could have developed such similar sclerites independently, but the huge difference in the structures of their bodies makes it hard to see how they could be closely related.\nRelationships to other animal groups.\nIn the 1990s, sponges were widely regarded as a monophyletic group, all of them having descended from a common ancestor that was itself a sponge, and as the \"sister-group\" to all other metazoans (multi-celled animals), which themselves form a monophyletic group. On the other hand, some 1990s analyses also revived the idea that animals' nearest evolutionary relatives are choanoflagellates, single-celled organisms very similar to sponges' choanocytes \u2013 which would imply that most Metazoa evolved from very sponge-like ancestors and therefore that sponges may not be monophyletic, as the same sponge-like ancestors may have given rise both to modern sponges and to non-sponge members of Metazoa.\nAnalyses since 2001 have concluded that Eumetazoa (more complex than sponges) are more closely related to particular groups of sponges than to other sponge groups. Such conclusions imply that sponges are not monophyletic, because the last common ancestor of all sponges would also be a direct ancestor of the Eumetazoa, which are not sponges. A study in 2001 based on comparisons of ribosome DNA concluded that the most fundamental division within sponges was between glass sponges and the rest, and that Eumetazoa are more closely related to calcareous sponges (those with calcium carbonate spicules) than to other types of sponge. In 2007, one analysis based on comparisons of RNA and another based mainly on comparison of spicules concluded that demosponges and glass sponges are more closely related to each other than either is to the calcareous sponges, which in turn are more closely related to Eumetazoa.\nOther anatomical and biochemical evidence links the Eumetazoa with Homoscleromorpha, a sub-group of demosponges. A comparison in 2007 of nuclear DNA, excluding glass sponges and comb jellies, concluded that:\nThe sperm of Homoscleromorpha share features with the sperm of Eumetazoa, that sperm of other sponges lack. In both Homoscleromorpha and Eumetazoa layers of cells are bound together by attachment to a carpet-like basal membrane composed mainly of \"typ\u00a0IV\" collagen, a form of collagen not found in other sponges \u2013 although the spongin fibers that reinforce the mesohyl of all demosponges is similar to \"type\u00a0IV\" collagen.\nThe analyses described above concluded that sponges are closest to the ancestors of all Metazoa, of all multi-celled animals including both sponges and more complex groups. However, another comparison in 2008 of 150\u00a0genes in each of 21\u00a0genera, ranging from fungi to humans but including only two species of sponge, suggested that comb jellies (ctenophora) are the most basal lineage of the Metazoa included in the sample. If this is correct, either modern comb jellies developed their complex structures independently of other Metazoa, or sponges' ancestors were more complex and all known sponges are drastically simplified forms. The study recommended further analyses using a wider range of sponges and other simple Metazoa such as Placozoa.\nHowever, reanalysis of the data showed that the computer algorithms used for analysis were misled by the presence of specific ctenophore genes that were markedly different from those of other species, leaving sponges as either the sister group to all other animals, or an ancestral paraphyletic grade. 'Family trees' constructed using a combination of all available data \u2013 morphological, developmental and molecular \u2013 concluded that the sponges are in fact a monophyletic group, and with the cnidarians form the sister group to the bilaterians.\nA very large and internally consistent alignment of 1,719\u00a0proteins at the metazoan scale, published in 2017, showed that (i)\u00a0sponges \u2013 represented by Homoscleromorpha, Calcarea, Hexactinellida, and Demospongiae \u2013 are monophyletic, (ii)\u00a0sponges are sister-group to all other multicellular animals, (iii)\u00a0ctenophores emerge as the second-earliest branching animal lineage, and (iv)\u00a0placozoans emerge as the third animal lineage, followed by cnidarians sister-group to bilaterians.\nIn March\u00a02021, scientists from Dublin found additional evidence that sponges are the sister group to all other animals, while in May\u00a02023, Schultz et al. found patterns of irreversible change in genome synteny that provide strong evidence that ctenophores are the sister group to all other animals instead.\nNotable spongiologists.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUse.\nBy dolphins.\nA report in 1997 described use of sponges as a tool by bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay in Western Australia. A dolphin will attach a marine sponge to its rostrum, which is presumably then used to protect it when searching for food in the sandy sea bottom. The behavior, known as \"sponging\", has only been observed in this bay and is almost exclusively shown by females. A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behavior to their daughters and that all the sponge users are closely related, suggesting that it is a fairly recent innovation.\nBy humans.\nSkeleton.\nThe calcium carbonate or silica spicules of most sponge genera make them too rough for most uses, but two genera, \"Hippospongia\" and \"Spongia\", have soft, entirely fibrous skeletons. Early Europeans used soft sponges for many purposes, including padding for helmets, portable drinking utensils and municipal water filters. Until the invention of synthetic sponges, they were used as cleaning tools, applicators for paints and ceramic glazes and discreet contraceptives. However, by the mid-20th century, overfishing brought both the animals and the industry close to extinction.\nMany objects with sponge-like textures are now made of substances not derived from poriferans. Synthetic sponges include personal and household cleaning tools, breast implants, and contraceptive sponges. Typical materials used are cellulose foam, polyurethane foam, and less frequently, silicone foam.\nThe luffa \"sponge\", also spelled \"loofah\", which is commonly sold for use in the kitchen or the shower, is not derived from an animal but mainly from the fibrous \"skeleton\" of the sponge gourd (\"Luffa aegyptiaca\", Cucurbitaceae).\nMedicinal compounds.\nSponges have medicinal potential due to the presence in sponges themselves or their microbial symbionts of chemicals that may be used to control viruses, bacteria, tumors and fungi.\nLacking any protective shell or means of escape, sponges have evolved to synthesize a variety of unusual compounds. One such class is the oxidized fatty acid derivatives called oxylipins. Members of this family have been found to have anti-cancer, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. One example isolated from the Okinawan \"Plakortis\" sponges, plakoridine A, has shown potential as a cytotoxin to murine lymphoma cells.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It included the modern regions of western Hungary, western Slovakia, eastern Austria, northern Croatia, north-western Serbia, northern Slovenia, and northern Bosnia and Herzegovina. The northern and eastern boundary line of Pannonia was formed by the River Danube.\nBackground.\nIn the Early Iron Age, Transdanubia was inhabited by the Pannonians or Pannonii, a collection of Illyrian tribes. The Celts invaded the region during the Late Iron Age, and Gallo-Roman historian Pompeius Trogus wrote that they faced heavy resistance from the locals, which eventually prevented them from overrunning the southern part of Transdanubia. Some tribes advanced as far as Delphi, with the Scordisci settling in Syrmia (279 BC) upon being forced to withdraw. Additionally, the arrival of the Celts in Transdanubia disrupted the flow of amber from the Baltic Sea region, through the Amber Road, to the Illyrians. They founded many villages. Those that held prominent economic significance developed into \"oppida.\" Independent tribes minted their own coins with the faces of their leaders. These were at first modelled on Macedonian and, later, Roman currency.\nUpon the Scordisci's withdrawal and settlement, they and the Dardani (in Dardania) both became strong powers that opposed each other. The Dardani consistently raided Macedon and developed close ties to Rome. Philip V, who was a vehement enemy of the Dardani, allied with the Scordisci and, in 179 BC, persuaded the Bastarnae (at the Danube Delta) to break into Italy and subdue them on the way. Despite Philip's defeat at the hands of the Romans in 197 BC and the failure of the Bastarnae, at this time the Dardani's power crumbled under the pressure from the Macedonians and Scordisci. Finally, Perseus annihilated them, giving way to a hundred years of Scordisci hegemony in the Balkans. During this time, the tribe started raiding the new province of Macedonia, and \u2014Strabo says\u2014 expanded as far as Paeonia, Illyria, and Thrace.\nAquileia's foundation in 181 BC was the first step towards the Roman takeover of Pannonia. The town served as the starting station of the Amber Road and the launching point for attacks in that direction. The Scordisci, in alliance with the Dalmatae, were in armed conflict with the Romans as early as 156 BC and 119 BC. In both wars, the Romans failed to conquer Siscia (now Sisak, Croatia), which laid in a key position. After these setbacks, Rome turned its attention to Noricum, which had both iron and silver mines.\nAs part of a new Celtic migration wave at the end of the 2nd century BC, the Boii left Northern Italy and established themselves as a significant power on the Danube. According to Posidonius's record of the Cimbri migration (preserved by Strabo), they were first repulsed by the Boii, then by the Scordisci, and then by the Taurisci towards the Helvetii. This describes the balance of power in the region. In the early 1st century BC, the Dacians emerged as a new dominant power. While their hold on the area between the Danube and the Tisza river was loose, they had considerable influence in the territories beyond. In 88 BC, Scipio Asiaticus (consul 83 BC) defeated the Scordisci so badly that they retreated to the eastern part of Syrmia. Taking advantage of this situation, the Dacian king Burebista vanquished them sometime between 65 and 50 BC, and subsequently the Boii and the Taurisci too. Thanks to the ebb of these entities, several local tribes regained their independence and influence. In the context of Mithridates VI Eupator's unfulfilled plan to invade Italy from the north (64 BC), the territory he was to cross is noted to have belonged to the Pannonians. Immediately after Burebista's death (c.\u200944 BC), Dacia's kingdom dissolved too, leaving no entity in the region that Rome would make allowances for.\nRoman conquest.\nThe Pannonians were driven into conflict due to their support of the Dalmatae in their strife against Rome, but they weren't long-term and known enemies. The tribes north of the Drava River didn't participate in this, nor in the subsequent fights. In 35 BC, Octavian led a campaign against the Iapydes and the Pannonians, in which he captured Siscia in a month-long siege and occupied a large part of the Sava River valley. This was in accordance with Caesar's plan of creating a base for an invasion of Dacia, not realized due to his assassination. However, Octavian only used the hoax of the \"Dacian threat\" as a pretense to gain control over a large amount of land in the Second Triumvirate.\nIn 15 BC, the future emperor Tiberius defeated the Scordisci, forcing them to become allies. This was in response to Pannonian and Scordisci incursions the previous year. The following events were part of the Roman Empire's efforts to reach the Danube and are sometimes known thematically as \"Bellum Pannonicum\".\nIn 14 BC, the Pannonians rose up. Vipsanius Agrippa was sent to the region after another rebellion in 13 BC. After his death the following year, the campaign was taken over by Tiberius, who celebrated his triumph in 11 BC. The province of Illyricum was established between the Sava and the Adriatic Sea. In 10 BC, Tiberius returned to quell a new uprising of the Pannonians and Dalmatae. After winning in 9 BC, he sold the youth of the Breuci and Amantini as slaves in Italy and held an ovation. His operations between 12 and 9 BC included constant expeditions into territories north of the Drava and almost certainly brought the whole Transdanubia under Roman control, even though there's no direct evidence for that.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Through Tiberius Nero, then my stepson and legate, I brought under Roman authority the Pannonian peoples, which no Roman army had approached before I became princeps and advanced the boundaries of Illyricum to the bank of the Danube.\u2014\u200aPannonia was invaded by the Dacians in 10 BC. The Romans launched campaigns through the Danube in order to secure it as the imperial border and defend the threatened new land. Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus's (consul 16 BC) operation in 1 AD extended as far as the Elbe. In 10 AD, Cornelius Lentulus Augur was able to debar not just the Dacians, but also the Sarmatians \"from access to the Danube\", says Florus. Locally more important was the offensive of Marcus Vinicius against the tribes east of the Danube Bend, showing an intent of \"monopolizing\" the Northern Transdanubian region politically. The last decade of the century saw the Marcomanni under their king Maroboduus, settling north of Pannonia. Augustus planned a two-sided attack on them, with one army approaching their territory from the Rhine and another one under Tiberius crossing the Danube at Carnuntum.\nBefore witnessing any result, Tiberius had to rush back in 6 AD and face a new uprising. The unfolding \"Bellum Batonianum\" lasted for three years. The Breuci (under Bato the Breucian) and Daesitiates (under Bato the Daesitiate and Pinnes) took the leading role, while the tribes north of the Drava stayed out again. The insurgents attempted to invade Italy and Macedonia, but due to their lack of success, they united to besiege Sirmium (now Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia). There, Caecina Severus defeated the insurgents, who retreated into the Fru\u0161ka gora Mountains. He annihilated them the following year when they tried to intercept him on his way to join Tiberius at Siscia. Tiberius competently initiated a scorched-earth policy which was unsatisfactory for Augustus, who sent more generals, including Germanicus and Plautius Silvanus (consul 2 BC) to the war theatre. A capitulation was forced out in 8 AD, and Bato the Breucian delivered Pinnes to the Romans, becoming a vassal king of his tribe. However, the revolt flared up once again as the Daesitiates captured and executed Bato the Breucian and persuaded his people to continue the resistance. Silvanus reconquered them and ousted Bato the Daesitiate into the Dinaric Alps, where he laid down arms in 9 AD.\nHistory.\nConsolidation and establishment of administration.\nIllyricum was divided into Dalmatia (initially called Illyricum Superius) and Pannonia (initially Illyricum Inferius) in 8 or 9 AD.\nAccording to Suetonius, with the \"Bellum Batonianum\", Tiberius finally defeated all peoples between the Danube and the Adriatic Sea. No Illyrian resistance is known after this, not due to the natives' compliance with the new \"status quo\", but due to their extreme exhaustion. The eligible Pannonian youth were conscripted and commanded to other provinces. The communities taking part in the uprising were afterward relocated and organized into \"civitates\" under military supervision.\nThe military occupation of Pannonia may have been carried out in gradual steps. The Romans felt it necessary to resettle certain tribes to the territory of the peoples north of the Drava, which, for them, had no economic, but strategic significance. Augustus formed a kind of alliance where the Romans would act as supervisors, and it was not until his death (14 AD) that legions would be moved over from South Pannonia.\nThe second emperor Tiberius (r.\u200917\u00a0\u2013\u00a037 AD) founded multiple \"coloniae\" in the province and developed its road network. However, due to these land's unsuitability for cultivation, it was a hard task to persuade veterans to comply with settling there, and he had to silence a mutiny right when assuming power. He sent his son Drusus Julius Caesar to create tranquility and depose Maroboduus, who needed Roman support for his war against Arminius. This ultimately caused the rise of Vannius (20 AD), who ruled over an extended realm.\nIt was Claudius (r.\u200941\u00a0\u2013\u00a054 AD) who finished Pannonia's occupation and began to construct of the local \"limes\". Systematic integration into the Empire accompanied by the establishment of settled Roman life progressed subsequently. In 50 AD, Vannius was overthrown by Vangio and Sido, who enjoyed the emperor's support. By this date, the nomadic Sarmatian population of the Iazyges had taken possession of the Danube\u2013Tisza Interfluve, helping the Romans by being a buffer state against the dangerous Dacians.\nAt first, the primary goal of the Roman administration was the conclusion of the barbarian conflicts outside the province. In Nero's time (r.\u200954\u00a0\u2013\u00a068 AD) as many as 100,000 barbarians were moved from Pannonia to Moesia by Plautius Silvanus Aelianus, and 50,000 may have been settled in Pannonia by Tampius Flavianus. During his important governorship, money began to circulate in the Barbaricum and the line of the \"limes\" was stabilized.\nUnder the Flavians.\nThe Year of the Four Emperors (69 AD) passed with peace in Pannonia. Flavianus declared for Vespasian and led his legions to Italy against Vitellius. Vespasian (r.\u200969\u00a0\u2013\u00a079 AD) invested greatly in the construction of the \"limes\". Discarding the Augustan strategy where the legions' role was with maintaining order in their provinces, the Flavian emperors continually moved them to the border. This way they were prevented from interfering in domestic policy, while the conquests were already pacified. Systematic circulation of money in the region situated north of the Drava shows that by this time Roman civilization had firmly taken root there.\nDomitian's (r.\u200981\u00a0\u2013\u00a096) emperorship saw expensive wars with the barbarians, as a result of which the military emphasis shifted to the Danube frontier. At the end of 85 or the beginning of 86, the reemerging Dacians under Decebalus raided Moesia, killing its governor and eradicating a legion. After a brief stay, Domitian left Cornelius Fuscus to deal with the situation. After clearing the province of raiders, Fuscus undertook a disastrous campaign and lost his life (86). Finally, in 88, Tettius Julianus defeated Decebalus and the sides agreed to make peace. Vangio and Sido were most likely dead by now, the Marcomanni and Quadi denied vassal duties. When the emperor's punitive expedition (partially sent through Dacian territory) was repelled in 89, he\u2014despite the damages suffered\u2014settled for mild terms with Decebalus, instead committing his forces elsewhere. In the same year, he held his triumphs over the Dacians and Chatti, but not over the disloyal Danubian Germans. When the Romans started supporting the Lugii against them, they made a pact with the Iazyges. This produced another war, almost completely unknown except for another catastrophe and destruction of a legion at the hands of the nomads. In 92 or 93, he finished the war, but held only an ovation, indicating he probably had further plans in Pannonia.\nUnder the Antonines.\nWe hear of war with the Danubian Germans again under Nerva (r.\u200996\u00a0\u2013\u00a098).\nBetween 103 and 107, Trajan (r.\u200998\u00a0\u2013\u00a0117) executed the division of the province into Pannonia Inferior and Pannonia Superior. This allowed the Empire to better combat the radically different Germanic and Sarmatian tribes. While Superior had most urbanized areas and a shorter frontier with three legions, Inferior contained one \"municipium\" and one legion, virtually being a border zone. Under his reign, the placement of garrison and the main lines of commerce became permanent.\nThe creation of Roman Dacia had a great effect on Pannonia. In Trajan's Dacian Wars, the Iazyges allied with the Romans, seeking to retain Oltenia where they were expelled by Decebalus. A brief confrontation in 107 was resolved Hadrian, then-governor of Pannonia Inferior and it may have been agreed that the nomads would instead take possession of the region between the Tisza and the Apuseni Mountains, not incorporated into the new province. However, taking advantage of Trajan's death and the preoccupation of the Empire with the Parthian war, they joined forces with the relative Roxolani and attacked again in 117, to which Dacia's governor, Julius Quadratus Bassus fell victim. Hadrian (r.\u2009117\u00a0\u2013\u00a0138) traveled to the spot and invested Marcius Turbo as governor of both Dacia and Pannonia Inferior to defeat the barbarians. The Roxolani were pacified first. Turbo's authorization was over in 119 as Iazyx peace envoys appeared in Rome. The postal connection between the two provinces through the Danube\u2013Tisza Interfluve\u2014which aggravated relations with the Sarmatians\u2014was completed.\nWar with the Quadi broke out again in the last years of Hadrian's reign, which his adopted son and joint governor of the Pannonian provinces, Aelius Caesar successfully handled until he died in 138. Command of Pannonia Superior was taken over by Haterius Nepos, who ended the war with a Roman victory, becoming the last person to be awarded with \"ornamenta triumphalia\".\nUnder Antoninus Pius's (r.\u2009138\u00a0\u2013\u00a0161) quiet reign, some coins were issued propagating not the ending of a new campaign but the reestablishment of \"foederatus\" relationship by the investiture of a new Quadi king. Discharges and detachments of troops happened.\nFindings of hoards of coins likely buried during the rule of Marcus Aurelius (r.\u2009161\u00a0\u2013\u00a0180) evidence turmoil due to barbarian attacks. Large-scale population movements in Northern and Eastern Europe related to the Goths highly endangered Rome's clients, who wanted the Empire to give its lands to settlement and extend its protection over the tribes. Rome was unwilling to grant these requests. The Romans may not have been aware of the dangerous situation at the start of the Parthian war of Lucius Verus because they sent a whole legion and many \"vexillationes\" away from Pannonia. It is thanks to the diplomatic efforts made by regional governors that tensions were eased until the dispatched forces could get back. When the threat became fully clear, Marcus even raised new legions. The first attack came in the winter of 166-167, from the Lombards and Ubii, between Brigetio and Arrabona. It was quickly repulsed by two auxiliary units. Cassius Dio tells of a legation of 11 tribes led by the Marcomanni subsequently petitioning the governor of Pannonia Superior, Iallius Bassus to concede. This may have been the last attempt at making peace, as next, a barbarian coalition formed to fight Rome.\nIn 168, Marcus and Verus returned to Aquileia and set up their base there. The Marcomanni and Quadi broke through the border and the Alps' crosses, besieging the city and burning the small town of Opitergium. The peak of the Antonine Plague in the peninsula was at this time, causing Verus's death. The next years' heavy fighting resulted in the death of governor of Moesia Superior and Dacia Claudius Fronto and praetorian prefect Macrinius Vindex. Claudius Pompeianus and future-emperor Pertinax returned part of the spoils taken by the enemy and led the offensive starting from 172. Against severe losses, the Romans forced first the Quadi, then the Marcomanni to surrender (172\u2013173), while the military emphasis shifted to the Iazyges. Despite the winter incursion of the Iazyges was crushed (173-174), the Quadi overthrew their Roman-installed king and started to support the nomads. While the two nations tried to negotiate, Marcus eventually defeated both of them in separate campaigns.\nThe second phase of the war started in 177. The attacking barbarians were kept in check, with Marcus and his son, the newly acclaimed Commodus (r.\u2009177\u00a0\u2013\u00a0192) coming to Pannonia. A decisive campaign by Tarrutenius Paternus in 179 convinced the Iazyges to make peace. In the same year, the land of the Danubian Germans was occupied by a force Cassius Dio claims to be 40,000 men\u2014the number of soldiers stationed in Pannonia Inferior and Pannonia Superior combined. Control over tribes was taken over by prefects. Valerius Maximianus, born in Pannonia, was an important general here. Any possible plans with the creation of two new provinces\u2014Marcomannia and Sarmatia\u2014were aborted after the death of Marcus in 180. Commodus returned to the old border and client system, to which new residents were seemingly willing to join. As the barbarians pillaged during the war, taking cattle and captives away en masse, the destruction and loss of life in Pannonia was huge.\nCommodus vigorously started to strengthen the \"limes\" with new fortifications. Minor raids on the province continued to occur, prompting a third campaign over the Danube at about. This campaign was smaller, and its leader, Tigidius Perennis, achieved a victory. Another victorious expedition was conducted in 188.\nUnder the Severans.\nDuring the Year of the Five Emperors (193), no attack was made on Pannonia. According to Herodian, Septimius Severus (r.\u2009193\u00a0\u2013\u00a0211) calmed the barbarian tribes via negotiations before marching off his troops to Italy and gaining the throne. In the coming years, the arrival of foreign groups led to new conflicts, but these were centered on Dacia and Pannonia only experienced collateral effects. The Severans' rule was supported by the Pannonian military and other provinces of the collective \"Illyricum\" region, which became politically important. In 202, a thorough visit to Pannonia by the imperial house was organized. Partly during this tour and throughout Severus' reign, the province benefited from many constructions. The road network was fully repaired, civilian and military buildings were inaugurated, military camps were improved and cities were protected with walls thus increasing their rank.\nAdministration.\nPannonia Superior was under the consular legate, who had formerly administered the single province, and had three legions under his control. Pannonia Inferior was at first under a praetorian legate with a single legion as the garrison; after Marcus Aurelius, it was under a consular legate, but still with only one legion. The frontier on the Danube was protected by the establishment of the two colonies Aelia Mursia and Aelia Aquincum by Hadrian.\nUnder Diocletian and his successors, a fourfold division of the country was made:\nDiocletian also moved parts of today's Slovenia out of Pannonia and incorporated them in Noricum. In 324 AD, Constantine I enlarged the borders of Roman Pannonia to the east, annexing the plains of what is now eastern Hungary, northern Serbia and western Romania up to the limes that he created: the Devil's Dykes.\nIn the 4th\u20135th century, one of the dioceses of the Roman Empire was known as the Diocese of Pannonia. It had its capital in Sirmium and included all four provinces that were formed from historical Pannonia, as well as the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum Mediterraneum and Noricum Ripense.\nLoss.\nIn the 4th century, the Romans (especially under Valentinian I) fortified the villas and relocated barbarians to the border regions. In 358 they won a great victory over the Sarmatians, but raids didn't stop. In 401 the Visigoths fled to the province from the Huns, and the border guarding peoples fled to Italia from them, but were beaten by Uldin in exchange for the transferring of Eastern Pannonia. In 433 Rome completely handed over the territory to Attila for the subjugation of the Burgundians attacking Gaul.\nAfter Roman rule.\nDuring the Migration Period in the 5th century, some parts of Pannonia were ceded to the Huns in 433 by Flavius Aetius, the magister militum of the Western Roman Empire. After the collapse of the Hunnic empire in 454, large numbers of Ostrogoths were settled by Emperor Marcian in the province as foederati. The Eastern Roman Empire controlled southern parts of Pannonia in the 6th century, during the reign of Justinian I. The Byzantine province of Pannonia with its capital at Sirmium was temporarily restored, but it included only a small southeastern part of historical Pannonia.\nAfterwards, it was again invaded by the Avars in the 560s, and the Slavs, who first may settled c. 480s but became independent only from the 7th century. In 790s, it was invaded by the Franks, who used the name \"Pannonia\" to designate the newly formed frontier province, the March of Pannonia. The term Pannonia was also used for Slavic polity like Lower Pannonia that was vassal to the Frankish Empire.\nThrough Roman influence, a dialect of Latin now called Pannonian Latin developed in the region; the several major political shifts would see it extinct around the 6th century.\nCities and auxiliary forts.\nThe native settlements consisted of (cantons) containing a number of (villages), the majority of the large towns being of Roman origin. The cities and towns in Pannonia were:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNow in Austria:\nNow in Bosnia and Herzegovina:\nNow in Croatia:\nNow in Hungary:\nNow in Serbia:\nNow in Slovakia:\nNow in Slovenia:\nEconomy.\nThe country was fairly productive, especially after the great forests had been cleared by Probus and Galerius. Before that time, timber had been one of its most important exports. Its chief agricultural products were oats and barley, from which the inhabitants brewed a kind of beer named sabaea. Vines and olive trees were little cultivated. Pannonia was also famous for its breed of hunting dogs. Although no mention is made of its mineral wealth by the ancients, it is probable that it contained iron and silver mines.\nSlavery.\nSlavery held a less important role in Pannonia's economy than in earlier established provinces. Rich civilians had domestic slaves do the housework while soldiers who had been awarded with land had their slaves cultivate it. Slaves worked in workshops primarily in western cities for rich industrialist. In Aquincum, they were freed in a short time.\nReligion.\nPannonia had sanctuaries for Jupiter, Juno and Minerva, official deities of empire, and also for old Celtic deities. In Aquincum there was one for the mother goddess. The imperial cult was also present. In addition, Judaism and eastern mystery cults also appeared, the latter centered around Mithra, Isis, Anubis and Serapis.\nChristianity began to spread inside the province in the 2nd century. Its popularity didn't decrease even during the big persecutions in the late 3rd century. In the 4th century, basilicas and funeral chapels were built. We know of the Church of Saint Quirinus in Savaria and numerous early Christian memorials from Aquincum, Sopianae, Fen\u00e9kpuszta, and Arian Christian ones from Csopak.\nLegacy.\nThe ancient name Pannonia is retained in the modern term \"Pannonian plain\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47278", "revid": "2576398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47278", "title": "Cognitive bias", "text": "Systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment\nA cognitive bias is a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. Individuals create their own \"subjective reality\" from their perception of the input. An individual's construction of reality, not the objective input, may dictate their behavior in the world. Thus, cognitive biases may sometimes lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, and irrationality.\nWhile cognitive biases may initially appear to be negative, some are adaptive. They may lead to more effective actions in a given context. Furthermore, allowing cognitive biases enables faster decisions which can be desirable when timeliness is more valuable than accuracy, as illustrated in heuristics. Other cognitive biases are a \"by-product\" of human processing limitations, resulting from a lack of appropriate mental mechanisms (bounded rationality), the impact of an individual's constitution and biological state (see embodied cognition), or simply from a limited capacity for information processing. Cognitive biases can make individuals more inclined to endorsing pseudoscientific beliefs by requiring less evidence for claims that confirm their preconceptions. This can potentially distort their perceptions and lead to inaccurate judgments.\nA continually evolving list of cognitive biases has been identified over the last six decades of research on human judgment and decision-making in cognitive science, social psychology, and behavioral economics. The study of cognitive biases has practical implications for areas including clinical judgment, entrepreneurship, finance, and management.\nOverview.\nWhen making judgments under uncertainty, people rely on mental shortcuts or \"heuristics\", which provide swift estimates about the possibility of uncertain occurrences. For example, \nthe representativeness heuristic is defined as the tendency to judge the frequency or likelihood of an occurrence by the extent of which the event resembles the typical case. Similarly the availability heuristic is that individuals estimate the likelihood of events by how easy they are to recall, and the anchoring heuristic prefers the initial reference points that are recalled. While these heuristics are efficient and simple for the brain to compute, they sometimes introduce predictable and systematic cognitive errors, or \"biases\".\nThe \"Linda Problem\" illustrates the representativeness heuristic and corresponding bias. Participants were given a description of \"Linda\" that suggests Linda might well be a feminist (e.g., she is said to be concerned about discrimination and social justice issues). They were then asked whether they thought Linda was more likely to be (a) a \"bank teller\" or (b) a \"bank teller and active in the feminist movement.\" A majority chose answer (b). Independent of the information given about Linda, though, the more restrictive answer (b) is under any circumstance statistically less likely than answer (a). This is an example of the conjunction fallacy: respondents chose (b) because it seemed more \"representative\" or typical of persons who might fit the description of Linda. The representativeness heuristic may lead to errors such as activating stereotypes and inaccurate judgments of others.\nGerd Gigerenzer argues that heuristics should not lead us to conceive of human thinking as riddled with irrational cognitive biases. They should rather conceive rationality as an adaptive tool, not identical to the rules of formal logic or the probability calculus. Gigerenzer believes that cognitive biases are not biases, but rules of thumb, or as he would put it \"gut feelings\" that can actually help us make accurate decisions in our lives. There is not clear evidence that these behaviors are genuinely, severely biased once the actual problems people face are understood. Advances in economics and cognitive neuroscience now suggest that many behaviors previously labeled as biases might instead represent optimal decision-making strategies.\nHistory.\nThe notion of cognitive biases was introduced by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in 1972 and grew out of their experience of people's \"innumeracy\", or inability to reason intuitively with the greater orders of magnitude. Tversky, Kahneman, and colleagues demonstrated several replicable ways in which human judgments and decisions differ from rational choice theory. Their 1974 paper, \"Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases\", outlined how people rely on mental shortcuts when making judgments under uncertainty. Experiments such as the \"Linda problem\" grew into heuristics and biases research programs, which spread beyond academic psychology into other disciplines including medicine and political science.\nThe list of cognitive biases has long been a topic of critique. In psychology a \"rationality war\" unfolded between Gerd Gigerenzer and the Kahneman and Tversky school, which pivoted on whether biases are primarily defects of human cognition or the result of behavioural patterns that are actually adaptive or \"ecologically rational\". Gerd Gigerenzer has historically been one of the main opponents to cognitive biases and heuristics. This debate has recently reignited, with critiques arguing there has been an overemphasis on biases in human cognition.\n introduced the concept of cognitive bias modification, which focuses on reducing maladaptive cognitive patterns through computer-based attention training and behavioral tasks.\nTypes.\nBiases can be distinguished on a number of dimensions. Examples of cognitive biases include -\nOther biases are due to the particular way the brain perceives, forms memories and makes judgments. This distinction is sometimes described as \"hot cognition\" versus \"cold cognition\", as motivated reasoning can involve a state of arousal. Among the \"cold\" biases,\nAs some biases reflect motivation specifically the motivation to have positive attitudes to oneself. It accounts for the fact that many biases are self-motivated or self-directed (e.g., illusion of asymmetric insight, self-serving bias). There are also biases in how subjects evaluate in-groups or out-groups; evaluating in-groups as more diverse and \"better\" in many respects, even when those groups are arbitrarily defined (ingroup bias, outgroup homogeneity bias).\nSome cognitive biases belong to the subgroup of attentional biases, which refers to paying increased attention to certain stimuli. It has been shown, for example, that people addicted to alcohol and other drugs pay more attention to drug-related stimuli. Common psychological tests to measure those biases are the Stroop task and the dot probe task.\nIndividuals' susceptibility to some types of cognitive biases can be measured by the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) developed by Shane Frederick (2005).\nList of biases.\nThe following is a list of the more commonly studied cognitive biases:\nPractical significance.\nMany social institutions rely on individuals to make rational judgments. Across management, finance, medicine, and law, the most recurrent bias is overconfidence, though anchoring and framing also play substantial roles. While research in finance often uses large-scale data, studies in medicine and law frequently rely on vignette-based designs. Berthet highlights the lack of ecological validity in many studies and the need for deeper exploration of individual differences in susceptibility to bias. The securities regulation regime largely assumes that all investors act as perfectly rational persons. In truth, actual investors face cognitive limitations from biases, heuristics, and framing effects. In some academic disciplines, the study of bias is very popular. For instance, bias is a wide spread and well studied phenomenon because most decisions that concern the minds and hearts of entrepreneurs are computationally intractable.\nIn law enforcement and legal decision-making, confirmation bias and related errors frequently influence investigative decisions and evidence evaluation. Structured intervention strategies, such as accountability measures and checklists, show some promise in reducing bias during case evaluations. A fair jury trial, for example, requires that the jury ignore irrelevant features of the case, weigh the relevant features appropriately, consider different possibilities open-mindedly and resist fallacies such as appeal to emotion. The various biases demonstrated in these psychological experiments suggest that people will frequently fail to do all these things. However, they fail to do so in systematic, directional ways that are predictable.\nCognitive biases can create other issues that arise in everyday life. Study participants who ate more unhealthy snack food tended to have less inhibitory control and more reliance on approach bias. Cognitive biases could be linked to various eating disorders and how people view their bodies and their body image.\nCognitive biases can be used in destructive ways. Some believe that there are people in authority who use cognitive biases and heuristics in order to manipulate others so that they can reach their end goals. Some medications and other health care treatments rely on cognitive biases in order to persuade others who are susceptible to cognitive biases to use their products. Many see this as taking advantage of one's natural struggle of judgement and decision-making. They also believe that it is the government's responsibility to regulate these misleading ads.\nCognitive biases also seem to play a role in property sale price and value. Participants in the experiment were shown a residential property. Afterwards, they were shown another property that was completely unrelated to the first property. They were asked to say what they believed the value and the sale price of the second property would be. They found that showing the participants an unrelated property did have an effect on how they valued the second property.\nCognitive biases can be used in non-destructive ways. In team science and collective problem-solving, the superiority bias can be beneficial. It leads to a diversity of solutions within a group, especially in complex problems, by preventing premature consensus on suboptimal solutions. This example demonstrates how a cognitive bias, typically seen as a hindrance, can enhance collective decision-making by encouraging a wider exploration of possibilities.\nCognitive biases are interlinked with collective illusions, a phenomenon where a group of people mistakenly believe that their views and preferences are shared by the majority, when in reality, they are not. These illusions often arise from various cognitive biases that misrepresent our perception of social norms and influence how we assess the beliefs of others.\nCognitive biases also influence the spread of misinformation, particularly in digital environments. Lazer, Baum, and Grinberg (2018) analyzed over 16,000 false news stories shared by millions of Twitter users during the 2016 U.S. election and found that false information spread significantly faster than accurate news. This occurs partly because misinformation aligns with existing beliefs and triggers emotional reactions, both of which are linked to confirmation and availability biases. These findings illustrate how cognitive biases can distort public understanding and contribute to the rapid dissemination of false narratives.\nReducing.\nThe content and direction of cognitive biases are not \"arbitrary\". Debiasing is the reduction of biases in judgment and decision-making through incentives, nudges, and training. Cognitive bias mitigation and cognitive bias modification are forms of debiasing specifically applicable to cognitive biases and their effects. One debiasing technique aims to decrease biases by encouraging individuals to use controlled processing compared to automatic processing. Because they cause systematic errors, cognitive biases cannot be compensated for using a wisdom of the crowd technique of averaging answers from several people. Reference class forecasting is a method for systematically debiasing estimates and decisions, based on what Daniel Kahneman has dubbed the outside view.\nCognitive bias modification (CBM) refers to the process of modifying cognitive biases in healthy people and also refers to a growing area of psychological (non-pharmaceutical) therapies for anxiety, depression and addiction called cognitive bias modification therapy (CBMT). CBMT is sub-group of therapies within a growing area of psychological therapies based on modifying cognitive processes with or without accompanying medication and talk therapy, sometimes referred to as applied cognitive processing therapies (ACPT). Although cognitive bias modification can refer to modifying cognitive processes in healthy individuals, CBMT is a growing area of evidence-based psychological therapy, in which cognitive processes are modified to relieve suffering from serious depression, anxiety, and addiction. CBMT techniques are technology-assisted therapies that are delivered via a computer with or without clinician support. CBM combines evidence and theory from the cognitive model of anxiety, cognitive neuroscience, and attentional models. Even one-shot training interventions, such as educational videos and debiasing games that taught mitigating strategies, significantly reduced the commission of several cognitive biases.\nCognitive bias modification has also been used to help those with obsessive-compulsive beliefs and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This therapy has shown that it decreases the obsessive-compulsive beliefs and behaviors.\nIn relation to reducing the fundamental attribution error, monetary incentives and informing participants they will be held accountable for their attributions have been linked to the increase of accurate attributions.\nCommon theoretical causes of some cognitive biases.\nBias arises from various processes that are sometimes difficult to distinguish. These include:\nIndividual differences in cognitive biases.\nPeople do appear to have stable individual differences in their susceptibility to decision biases such as overconfidence, temporal discounting, and bias blind spot. That said, these stable levels of bias within individuals are possible to change. Participants in experiments who watched training videos and played debiasing games showed medium to large reductions both immediately and up to three months later in the extent to which they exhibited susceptibility to six cognitive biases: anchoring, bias blind spot, confirmation bias, fundamental attribution error, projection bias, and representativeness.\nIndividual differences in cognitive bias have also been linked to varying levels of cognitive abilities and functions. The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) has been used to help understand the connection between cognitive biases and cognitive ability. There have been inconclusive results when using the Cognitive Reflection Test to understand ability. However, there does seem to be a correlation; those who gain a higher score on the Cognitive Reflection Test, have higher cognitive ability and rational-thinking skills. This in turn helps predict the performance on cognitive bias and heuristic tests. Those with higher CRT scores tend to be able to answer more correctly on different heuristic and cognitive bias tests and tasks.\nAge is another individual difference that has an effect on one's ability to be susceptible to cognitive bias. Older individuals tend to be more susceptible to cognitive biases and have less cognitive flexibility. However, older individuals were able to decrease their susceptibility to cognitive biases throughout ongoing trials. These experiments had both young and older adults complete a framing task. Younger adults had more cognitive flexibility than older adults. Cognitive flexibility is linked to helping overcome pre-existing biases.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In a topological space, a closed set can be defined as a set which contains all its limit points. In a complete metric space, a closed set is a set which is closed under the limit operation. This should not be confused with closed manifold.\nSets that are both open and closed are called clopen sets.\nDefinition.\nGiven a topological space formula_1, the following statements are equivalent:\nAn alternative characterization of closed sets is available via sequences and nets. A subset formula_7 of a topological space formula_12 is closed in formula_12 if and only if every limit of every net of elements of formula_7 also belongs to formula_15 In a first-countable space (such as a metric space), it is enough to consider only convergent sequences, instead of all nets. One value of this characterization is that it may be used as a definition in the context of convergence spaces, which are more general than topological spaces. Notice that this characterization also depends on the surrounding space formula_16 because whether or not a sequence or net converges in formula_12 depends on what points are present in formula_3 \nA point formula_19 in formula_12 is said to be close to a subset formula_2 if formula_22 (or equivalently, if formula_19 belongs to the closure of formula_7 in the topological subspace formula_25 meaning formula_26 where formula_27 is endowed with the subspace topology induced on it by formula_12). \nBecause the closure of formula_7 in formula_12 is thus the set of all points in formula_12 that are close to formula_32 this terminology allows for a plain English description of closed subsets: \na subset is closed if and only if it contains every point that is close to it. \nIn terms of net convergence, a point formula_33 is close to a subset formula_7 if and only if there exists some net (valued) in formula_7 that converges to formula_36 \nIf formula_12 is a topological subspace of some other topological space formula_38 in which case formula_39 is called a topological super-space of formula_16 then there might exist some point in formula_41 that is close to formula_7 (although not an element of formula_12), which is how it is possible for a subset formula_2 to be closed in formula_12 but to not be closed in the \"larger\" surrounding super-space formula_46 \nIf formula_2 and if formula_39 is any topological super-space of formula_12 then formula_7 is always a (potentially proper) subset of formula_51 which denotes the closure of formula_7 in formula_53 indeed, even if formula_7 is a closed subset of formula_12 (which happens if and only if formula_56), it is nevertheless still possible for formula_7 to be a proper subset of formula_58 However, formula_7 is a closed subset of formula_12 if and only if formula_61 for some (or equivalently, for every) topological super-space formula_39 of formula_3 \nClosed sets can also be used to characterize continuous functions: a map formula_64 is continuous if and only if formula_65 for every subset formula_2; this can be reworded in plain English as: formula_67 is continuous if and only if for every subset formula_68 formula_67 maps points that are close to formula_7 to points that are close to formula_71 Similarly, formula_67 is continuous at a fixed given point formula_33 if and only if whenever formula_19 is close to a subset formula_68 then formula_76 is close to formula_71\nMore about closed sets.\nThe notion of closed set is defined above in terms of open sets, a concept that makes sense for topological spaces, as well as for other spaces that carry topological structures, such as metric spaces, differentiable manifolds, uniform spaces, and gauge spaces. \nWhether a set is closed depends on the space in which it is embedded. However, the compact Hausdorff spaces are \"absolutely closed\", in the sense that, if you embed a compact Hausdorff space formula_78 in an arbitrary Hausdorff space formula_16 then formula_78 will always be a closed subset of formula_12; the \"surrounding space\" does not matter here. Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification, a process that turns a completely regular Hausdorff space into a compact Hausdorff space, may be described as adjoining limits of certain nonconvergent nets to the space.\nFurthermore, every closed subset of a compact space is compact, and every compact subspace of a Hausdorff space is closed.\nClosed sets also give a useful characterization of compactness: a topological space formula_12 is compact if and only if every collection of nonempty closed subsets of formula_12 with empty intersection admits a finite subcollection with empty intersection.\nA topological space formula_12 is disconnected if there exist disjoint, nonempty, open subsets formula_7 and formula_86 of formula_12 whose union is formula_3 Furthermore, formula_12 is totally disconnected if it has an open basis consisting of closed sets.\nProperties.\nA closed set contains its own boundary. In other words, if you are \"outside\" a closed set, you may move a small amount in any direction and still stay outside the set. This is also true if the boundary is the empty set, e.g. in the metric space of rational numbers, for the set of numbers of which the square is less than formula_90 \nIn fact, if given a set formula_12 and a collection formula_92 of subsets of formula_12 such that the elements of formula_94 have the properties listed above, then there exists a unique topology formula_95 on formula_12 such that the closed subsets of formula_1 are exactly those sets that belong to formula_98 \nThe intersection property also allows one to define the closure of a set formula_7 in a space formula_16 which is defined as the smallest closed subset of formula_12 that is a superset of formula_15\nSpecifically, the closure of formula_12 can be constructed as the intersection of all of these closed supersets.\nSets that can be constructed as the union of countably many closed sets are denoted F\u03c3 sets. These sets need not be closed.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A 2000 report of previous studies' sampling found that 60% of samples had been taken near towns or roads, where 22% would be the average, had the samples been taken at random (or from equidistant points, or at specifically varying distances from towns, representative of the average terrain density).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
