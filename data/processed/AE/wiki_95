Formerly The Town of Saint Michael, the Greater Bridgetown area is located within the parish of Saint Michael. Bridgetown is sometimes locally referred to as \"The City\", but the most common reference is simply \"Town\". As of 2014, its metropolitan population stands at roughly 110,000.\nThe \"Bridgetown\" port, found along Carlisle Bay (at ) lies on the southwestern coast of the island. Parts of the Greater Bridgetown area (as roughly defined by the Ring Road Bypass or more commonly known as the ABC Highway), sit close to the borders of the neighbouring parishes Christ Church and St. James. The Grantley Adams International Airport for Barbados, the only airport on the island, is located southeast of Bridgetown city centre. It has daily flights to major cities in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada and the Caribbean. There is no longer a local municipal government, but it is a constituency of the national Parliament. During the short-lived 1950s-1960s Federation of the British West Indian Territories, Bridgetown was one of three capital cities within the region being considered to be the Federal capital of the region.\nThe present-day location of the city was established by English settlers in 1628; a previous settlement under the authority of Sir William Courten was at St. James Town. Bridgetown is a major West Indies tourist destination, and the city acts as an important financial, informatics, convention centre, and cruise ship port of call in the Caribbean region. On 25 June 2011, \"Historic Bridgetown and its Garrison\" was added as a World Heritage Site of UNESCO.\nHistory.\nAlthough the island was totally abandoned or uninhabited when the British arrived, one of the few traces of indigenous pre-existence on the island was a primitive bridge constructed over the Careenage area's swamp at the centre of Bridgetown. It was thought that this bridge was created by a people indigenous to the Caribbean known as the Tainos. Upon finding the structure, the British settlers began to call what is now the Bridgetown area \"Indian Bridge\". Scholars widely believe that the Tainos were driven from Barbados to the neighbouring island of Saint Lucia, during an invasion by the Kalinagos, another indigenous people of the region. Eventually after 1654 when a new bridge was constructed over the Careenage by the British, the area became known as \"The Town of Saint Michael\" and later as \"Bridgetown\", after Sir Tobias Bridge.\nBridgetown is the only city outside the present United States that George Washington visited. (George Washington House, the house where he stayed, is included within the boundaries of the Garrison Historic Area.) Two of Washington's ancestors, Jonathon and Gerrard Hawtaine, were early planters on the island. Their grandmother was Mary Washington of Sulgrave, Northamptonshire, England. In 2011, historic buildings in Bridgetown were designated as a protected area by UNESCO.\nEarly settlement.\nEnglish settlement of Bridgetown began on 5 July 1628 under Charles Wolverstone, who brought with him 64 settlers to these lands formally claimed by James Hay, the Earl of Carlisle. Wolverstone had been sent by a group of London merchants, headed by Sir Marmaduke Rawdon. They had been granted a lease to of land by the Earl of Carlisle in settlement of debts. Wolverstone granted each of the settlers of land on the northern side of the Careenage waterway for the purpose of general settlement. The southern shore on Needham's Point was claimed by Carlisle's agents in October 1628. In 1631, many acres of land directly facing Carlisle Bay were passed to Henry Hawley, the new Governor; but after reports of his dishonest behaviour he was arrested and forcibly returned to England in 1639. An investigation by a commission in 1640 found that much of Hawley's land transactions were legitimate and properly showed these lands (including the town site) as being attributed to the Earl of Carlisle. Bridgetown was built with a street layout resembling early English medieval or market towns, with its narrow serpentine street and alley configuration. It is estimated that between 1627 and 1807, approximately 387,000 enslaved Africans were sent to Barbados.\nFrom town to city.\nIn 1824, Barbados became the seat of the Anglican Diocese of Barbados and the Leeward Islands. The St Michael's Parish Church became a cathedral, so that Bridgetown became a city. In 1842, Barbados, Trinidad, Tobago, Grenada, Saint Vincent, and Saint Lucia were split into separate dioceses by royal letters patent which also decreed that the Town of Bridgetown should be called the City of Bridgetown.\nFrom 1800 until 1885, Bridgetown was the main seat of government for the former British colonies of the Windward Islands. During this period, the resident governor of Barbados also served as the colonial head of the Windward Islands. After the Government of Barbados officially exited from the Windward Islands union in 1885, the seat was moved from Bridgetown to St. George's on the neighbouring island of Grenada.\nIn December 1925, a committee sought to petition the king for a royal charter of incorporation to provide local government in the city, proposed to consist of a mayor, 8 aldermen, 12 common councillors, a town clerk, a head-borough or chief constable, and such other officers as would be deemed necessary. It was proposed that the island's House of Assembly should seek to incorporate the city instead of using a royal charter.\nThis proposal did not succeed, but in 1958 the Local Government Act was passed in Barbados. This provided a separate administration for the city, with a mayor; 6 city aldermen; and 12 city councillors, four for each of the three wards in the city.\nOn 20 September 1960, the College of Arms in London granted arms to the City of Bridgetown. The armorial bearings were designed by the late Neville Connell, the then director of the Barbados Museum and Historical Society, and H. W. Ince, the honorary secretary of the society.\nLocal government in Barbados did not last long. In April 1967, the local government councils were dissolved and replaced by an interim commissioner for local government. The Corporation of Bridgetown thus ceased to exist, and its records and paraphernalia were deposited in both the Government Department of Archives and Barbados Museum and Historical Society. Today, Bridgetown and surrounding constituencies are administered by members of the Barbadian parliament.\nGeography and climate.\nGeography.\nAs established in the early 17th century, Bridgetown's centre was originally composed of a swamp, which was drained and filled in to make way for development.\nBoundaries.\nThe earliest boundaries of Bridgetown are contained by way of an act passed on 4 April 1660 called, \"to prevent the danger which may happen by fire, in or about any of the seaport towns of the Island\". The southern limit was declared to be the River (Careenage), whilst the western limit was declared to be the western boundary of St. Michael's (now St. Mary's) Churchyard, and extending in a direct line to the seaside. The town's other limits consisted of properties of certain citizens' names in this statute, the location of which cannot now be determined with certainty. The boundaries were not redefined until 1822.\nThrough Statutory Instrument (S.I) 1984 No. 141, Road Traffic Act, CAP. 295, ROAD TRAFFIC REGULATIONS, and under Schedule Sec. No. 6: The Boundaries of Bridgetown, Speightstown, Holetown and Oistin are cited as follows: 1) \"City of Bridgetown\" \u2013 \"Bridgetown\" \u2013 \"The City\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The area bounded by Highway 7 at the junction of Bay Street with Jemmotts Lane; thence in a north easterly and northerly direction following Jemmotts Lane, Martindales Road and Halls Road to the junction of Halls Road not including the said boundary roads; thence in a westerly direction following Tweedside Road and Roebuck Street to the junction of Country Road with Roebuck Street; thence in a northerly, westerly, and south-westerly direction following Country Road and Passage Road and Westbury Road to the junction of Westbury Road with President Kennedy Drive; thence in a southwesterly direction following President Kennedy Drive to its junction with Samuel Jackman Prescod Boulevard not including President Kennedy Drive; thence in a southerly and westerly direction following Samuel Jackman Prescod Boulevard to its junction with Princess Alice Highway not including Samuel Jackman Prescod Boulevard; thence continuing in a westerly direction to a point on the sea-coast; thence in a south-easterly direction following the sea coast to the junction of Bay Street with Jemmotts Lane.\nBeyond the boundary outlined, the wider Greater Bridgetown metropolitan area technically occupies most of the parish of Saint Michael, an area which covers around . The above portion for the Road Traffic Act also omits much of the 90 acres of new land originally formed by completion of the Port of Bridgetown in 1961.\nCareenage.\nAt the heart of Bridgetown is the Careenage and Constitution River. The Careenage can be considered a marina for boaters entering or exiting the inner basin located directly in front of the Parliament buildings of Barbados. This body of water provides the city with direct access from medium-sized yachts or small craft boats. Although moderately shallow, the Careenage slices Bridgetown into two parts. During the rainy season the Constitution River flows into the Careenage area and acts as an outflow for water from the country's interior storm drainage network. Flowing into the Carlisle Bay on the southwest coast of the island.\nClimate.\nBridgetown features a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Aw\"), with relatively constant temperatures throughout the course of the year. While fairly hot, Bridgetown is cooled somewhat by the trade winds that affect weather in Barbados in general. Bridgetown's record high of in September 2005 and record low of on 2 January 1984. Bridgetown features distinct wet and dry seasons, with a relatively lengthy wet season and a shorter dry season. Its wet season is from June through December, while the dry season covers the remaining months.\nThe City.\nIn the centre lies the main street of Bridgetown which is Broad Street which runs directly through the centre of the city. Broad Street passes the Parliament Buildings and serves as the centre of city's shopping area.\nAnother major traffic artery into the city is Bay Street (which turns into Highway 7) and leads toward the South Coast of Barbados and the Parish of Christ Church. There are also other notable streets in Bridgetown, including:\nHarbour.\nThe Bridgetown Port (or \"Deep Water Harbour\" as it is also known) is the major port of entry for cruise and cargo ships docking in Barbados. The Deep Water Harbour lies a short distance across Carlisle Bay northwest of the Careenage Canal. Found along the Princess Alice Highway, and west of the city's centre around Fontabelle.\nThe Harbour port acts as one of the major shipping and transhipment hubs from international locations for the entire Eastern Caribbean. Recently, the Bridgetown Port was dredged to allow safe access and berthing for the new league of \"super cruise ships\". The dredging project was completed in 2002 and the city can now host many of the largest cruise ships in the world.\nThe port of \"Bridgetown\" also handles goods for the domestic needs of the island. The island's main exports of mainly agricultural products also make use of the harbour facilities.\n\"Bridgetown\" also has a smaller canal in the centre of the city, named the Careenage, a.k.a. \"Constitution River\". The Constitution River should not be confused with the Deep Water Harbour. The smaller Constitution River feeding into the west coast lies about a half-kilometre south of the large harbour. The Careenage is just large enough for pleasure craft or fishing boats and has two main bridges near the city center which span the shallow Careenage.\nSociety and culture.\nBridgetown serves as a principal centre of commercial activity in Barbados, as well as a central hub for the island's public transport system. Many of the ministries and departments of the island's government are located within the Greater Bridgetown area. The Public Buildings or parliament, which stand at the heart of the city directly north of Heroes Square, house the third oldest continuous parliament in the British Commonwealth. Indeed, at one point in the city's early history, Bridgetown was the most important city of all British possessions in the New World due to the city's easterly location in the Caribbean region.\nThe headquarters of the National Library Service of Barbados is located in Bridgetown. The main branch is found on Coleridge Street, in a coral-stone building, built in the style of the English Renaissance.\nFor a city of its size, the Greater Bridgetown area is home to several prestigious educational institutions. The city serves as the seat of one of the three campuses of the University of the West Indies in the northern suburb of Cave Hill. The campus sits on a bluff offering views of Bridgetown and its port. The Barbados Community College is located east of the Central Business District in a suburb known as \"The Ivy\", while the sprawling campus of the Samuel Jackman Prescod Polytechnic is located just beyond the eastern limits of the city in a suburb known as \"The Pine\". In addition, the city houses such distinguished secondary schools as Harrison College, Combermere and The St. Michael School. The American University of Barbados, School of Medicine located in Wildey area of the Parish of Saint Michael located roughly 4\u00a0km east of Bridgetown, it lies on the border with the Parish of Christ Church.\nThe City of Bridgetown also played host to the 1994 United Nations Global Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Islands States. Bridgetown has branches of some of the largest banks in the world and English-speaking Caribbean and is internationally recognised as an emerging financial domicile. The city underwent considerable redevelopment in preparation for the 2007 World Cricket Cup Finals held at the historic Kensington Oval. The stadium was renovated to a state-of-the-art sports facility accommodating 30,000 spectators. Live viewership for the 2007 event was estimated to be over 100 million people worldwide.\nUtilities and local services.\nToday, Bridgetown is a fully modern and thriving city, with access to many modern services including a piped water supply (said to be naturally among the purest in the world), electricity, natural gas supply, cutting-edge telecommunications, wireless services, internet cafes, and a good overall infrastructure. The city is also served by an impressive conference facility known as the Sherbourne Conference Centre.\nEconomy.\nBarbados' main exports are sugar, rum, and molasses. The island is also involved in other industries namely tourism and the offshore sector.\nBusiness/specifics.\nBusiness: Banks are open 08:00\u201315:00,\nHours: Monday to Thursday, and 08:00\u201317:00 on Fridays.\nThe main banks are:\nAutomatic Teller Machines are available.\nShops are open:\nPayment cards are widely accepted.\nElectricity: 115 volts AC, 50 cycles.\nMost hotels have 220 AC.\nTelecommunications: the international dialling code for Barbados is +1.246 followed by seven digits.\nOn the island, use the seven digits alone.\nWhen on the island, to call anywhere in the United States or Canada simply dial +1 (area code) + seven digit phone number.\nEmergency numbers:\nPolice: 211 (emergency only)\nFire: 311\nAmbulance: 511\nCoast Guard and Defense Force: +1.246.427.8819\nTransportation.\nThe city has access to daily flights via the island's airport, the Sir Grantley Adams International Airport (GAIA) located on the ABC Highway/Highway 7 in Seawell, Christ Church. The city of Bridgetown and New York City in the United States, were the only cities in the Western Hemisphere to be served by regularly scheduled British Airways Concorde flights. Additionally, the GAIA has been chosen as one of only four global display sites for the retired supersonic aircraft. The Airport is in the final stages of an expansion project, which will also include the construction of an aviation museum to house the retired Concorde aircraft.\nAll seven of Barbados's primary highways begin close to the City of Bridgetown, in the Parish of Saint Michael. They all fan out to the north, south and east to other parts of the island. Driving is done of the left-hand side of the road with a speed limit of in built-up areas. The speed limit on the ABC Highway is generally except in built-up areas. Water transport is regulated by the Barbados Port Authority.\nPublic buses.\nPublic buses that head northward to destinations such as Holetown and Speightstown, and to some locations in St. Michael including the University of the West Indies \u2013 (Cave Hill Campus), leave from the Princess Alice Bus Terminal which lies to the west of the city centre. Buses for points east and south leave from the Fairchild Street Bus Terminal, which is on the eastern edge of the city centre, near to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH).\nRoute taxis.\nRoute taxis are privately owned minivans which operate as taxicabs for hire.\nDiplomatic missions in Barbados.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nBridgetown is twinned with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It ships most of the country's chief export, coffee, as well as cotton and tin ore. Bujumbura was formerly the country's political capital. In late December 2018, Burundian president Pierre Nkurunziza announced that he would follow through on a 2007 promise to return Gitega its former political capital status, with Bujumbura remaining as economical capital and center of commerce. A vote in the Parliament of Burundi made the change official on 16 January 2019, and as of late 2025, the transition is still ongoing, having estimated to end in 2022.\nHistory.\nBujumbura grew from a small village after it became a military post in German East Africa in 1889. After World War I it was made the administrative center and \"de facto\" capital of the Belgian League of Nations mandate of Ruanda-Urundi. The name was changed from Usumbura to Bujumbura upon Burundi's independence in 1962. Since independence, Bujumbura was the scene of frequent fighting between the country's two main ethnic groups, with Hutu militias opposing the Tutsi-dominated Burundi Army during the Burundian Civil War in the early 90s.\nGeography.\nBujumbura is on the north-eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, the second deepest lake in the world after Lake Baikal. The city also lies at the mouth of the Ruzizi River and the smaller Mutimbuzi River, Ntahangwa, Muha and Kanyosha Rivers.\nClimate.\nBujumbura has a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Aw\") bordering on hot semi-arid (\"BSh\"). There are distinct wet and dry seasons; the wet season being from October to April. Being close to the equator, average temperatures in the city vary little over the year, though they are affected by its altitude. The high temperature is around and the low around .\nAdministration.\nBujumbura is governed by a community council and community administrator. Until 2025, it was further divided into three \"communes\", or neighborhoods, each with its own council and council leader.\nBefore 2025, each of the three communes were created from the 13 former communes (currently sub-communes), due to a 2014 reorganization, which in turn are further sub-divided into villages or zones:\nEconomy.\nThe Port of Bujumbura is the largest port on Lake Tanganyika.\nBurundi depends on neighboring countries for access to the ocean. \nGoods may be carried by road via Rwanda, or by the lake and then by road or rail via Tanzania, Congo or Zambia.\n80% of Burundi's external trade is carried via the last three routes, using the Port of Bujumbura.\nThe port manages receipt and delivery of exports and imports, whether carried by ship or by truck.\nAs of 2011 more than 90% of cargo handled was imports, of which about 60% entered by ship and 40% by truck.\nBujumbura Central Market was in the city centre, along Rwagasore Avenue. During the 1993 ethnic violence in Burundi, citizens became less likely to travel far from the city centre, and markets in neighbouring communities lost their business to the central market.\nAt dawn on 27 January 2013 a serious fire ravaged the central market. Due to the poor emergency response, the fire lasted for hours, resulting in a serious blow to local exchanges. Hundreds of vendors, local and foreign, lost their goods to the fire and the reported looting.\nPolitics.\nList of mayors of Bujumbura\nUnder new territorial subdivision, list of governors of Bujumbura: \nSports.\nBujumbura is the location for the city's multisport Intwari stadium. Mainly used for football matches, it is the country's largest stadium with 22,000 seats.\nThe city is also home to many basketball and tennis courts, as well as a multitude of indoor and outdoor swimming pools.\nEducation.\nAlong side the University of Burundi, Bujumbura also host aseveral other universities namely:\nBujumbura is also host to several international schools:\nTransport.\nThe Bujumbura International Airport is situated on the outskirts of the city.\nPublic transport in Bujumbura mainly consists of taxis and mini-buses, locally known as the Hiace. Public transport vehicles are generally white and blue.\nBujumbura's taxis are abundant all over the city, and are considered the safest form of transportation. There are taxi-motos (motorcycle taxis) and taxis-v\u00e9los (bicycle taxis), although they are only available in certain parts of the city.\nFor long-distance travel, locals prefer to take the many Hiace full-size vans, which travel regularly across Burundi.

The city covers .\nCastries is on a flood plain and is built on reclaimed land. It houses the seat of government and the head offices of many foreign and local businesses. The city is laid out in a grid pattern. Its sheltered harbour receives cargo vessels, ferries and cruise ships. It houses duty-free shopping facilities such as Point Seraphine and La Place Carenage.\nCastries is the birthplace of Arthur Lewis, winner of the 1979 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, as well as of Derek Walcott, winner of the 1992 Nobel Prize for Literature.\nName.\nThe original name was \"Car\u00e9nage\" \"(\"\"safe anchorage\" in French, in reference to the city's deep water port), and was given by the French in 1650, at the time of founding. It adopted the name \"Castries\" in 1756, in honor of Charles Eug\u00e8ne Gabriel de La Croix, marquis de Castries, whose title relates to a commune in southern France; the origin for the commune's name is the Latin word \"castra\", plural of \"castrum\" (\"fortified field\", or \"strong castle, fortified city\" by extension).\nHistory.\nIn 1650, the fort \"aupr\u00e8s du Petit Cul-de-Sac et de la rivi\u00e8re du Car\u00e9nage\" was founded by a group of 40 Frenchmen led by de Rousselan, when St. Lucia was purchased by Capt. du Parquet and Monsieur Houel from the French West India Company. The capital was moved to the south side of the harbor in 1769 by Gov. Baron de Micoud. In 1785, the village of Car\u00e9nage was renamed Castries, after Charles Eug\u00e8ne Gabriel de La Croix, marquis de Castries, the French Minister of the Navy and Colonies.\nIn 1835, the British built the western wharf in 1642 to facilitate the coal trade and the first steamship arrived in 1841, the RMS \"Solway\".\nDuring World War II on 9 March 1942, the German U-161 sailed into Castries harbor at night and sank two allied ships, including the Canadian ocean liner RMS \"Lady Nelson\", which was subsequently refloated in the harbour and taken to Canada to be converted to a hospital ship.\nCastries has been rebuilt many times, following major fires on 15 October 1805, 6 April 1813, and most notably on 19 June 1948.\nClimate.\nCastries has a tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Af\").\nTourism.\nOne of the major tourist areas in St. Lucia, Castries is a port of call for cruise ships.

The city is Moldova's main industrial and commercial centre. It is situated in the middle of the country, on the river B\u00eec, a tributary of the Dniester. According to the results of the 2024 Moldovan census, the population of the city proper stood at over 567,000 inhabitants, while the population of the Municipality of Chi\u0219in\u0103u (which includes the city itself and other nearby communities) numbered over 720,000 people. Chi\u0219in\u0103u is the most economically prosperous locality in Moldova and the country's largest transport hub. Nearly a third of Moldova's population resides in the metropolitan area.\nMoldova has a history of winemaking dating back to at least 3,000 BC. As the capital city, Chi\u0219in\u0103u hosts the yearly national wine festival every October. Though the city's buildings were significantly damaged during the Second World War and earthquakes, a rich architectural heritage remains. In addition, it has numerous buildings designed in the postwar Socialist realism and Brutalist architecture styles.\nThe city's central railway station boasts a Russian-Imperial architectural style and maintains direct railway links to Romania. The Swiss-Italian-Russian architect Alexander Bernardazzi designed many of the city's buildings, including the Chi\u0219in\u0103u City Hall, Church of Saint Theodore, and the Church of Saint Panteleimon. The city hosts the National Museum of Fine Arts, Moldova State University, Brancusi Gallery, and National Museum of History of Moldova, with more than 236,000 exhibits.\nThere are bustling markets in the north of the city, including the house where Alexander Pushkin once resided while in exile from Alexander I of Russia. It has now been adapted as a museum. The Nativity Cathedral, located at the centre of the city and constructed in the 1830s, has been described as a \"masterpiece\" of Neoclassical architecture.\nEtymology.\nThe origin of the city's name is unclear. A theory suggests that the name may be derived from the archaic Romanian word (meaning \"spring\", \"source of water\") and (\"new\"), because it was built around a small spring, at the corner of Pu\u0219kin and Albi\u0219oara streets.\nThe other version, formulated by (or attributed to) \u0218tefan Ciobanu (occasionally to Iorgu Iordan), a Romanian historian and academician, holds that the name was formed the same way as the name of Chi\u0219ineu (alternatively spelled as \"Chi\u0219in\u0103u\") in Western Romania, near the border with Hungary. Its Hungarian name is , from which the Romanian name originates. Kisjen\u0151 comes from \"small\" and the Jen\u0151, one of the seven Hungarian tribes that entered the Carpathian Basin in 896.\nA third theory by , linguist and Slavist, holds (as a possible origin) that the name came from the Cuman \"ke\u0161ene\" (\"grave\", kurgan) and the Karachayian for \"cemetery\", and these came from the Persian word \"k\u0101\u0161\u0101ne\" (\"house\").\"https://\"\nChi\u0219in\u0103u is known in Russian as (, ), while Moldova's Russian-language media call it (, ). It is written in the Latin Gagauz alphabet. It was also written as \"Chi\u0219ineu\" in pre\u201320th-century Romanian and as in the Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet. Historically, the English-language name for the city, Kishinev, was based on the modified Russian one because it entered the English language via Russian at the time Chi\u0219in\u0103u was part of the Russian Empire (e.g., Kishinev pogrom). Therefore, it remains a common English name in some historical contexts. Otherwise, the Romanian-based \"Chi\u0219in\u0103u\" has been steadily gaining wider currency, especially in written language. The city is also historically referred to as ; ; ; ; , ; ; ; or .\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorical affiliations\n &lt;poem&gt;\n Principality of Moldavia 1436\u20131812\n Russian Empire 1812\u20131917\n Russian Republic 1917\n Moldavian Democratic Republic 1917\u20131918\n Kingdom of Romania 1918\u20131940\n Soviet Union 1940\u20131941\n Kingdom of Romania 1941\u20131944\n Soviet Union 1944\u20131991\n Moldova 1991\u2013present&lt;/poem&gt;\nMoldavian period.\nFounded in 1436 as a monastery village, the city was part of the Principality of Moldavia (which, starting with the 16th century, became a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, but still retaining its autonomy). At the beginning of the 19th century, Chi\u0219in\u0103u was a small town of 7,000 inhabitants.\nRussian Imperial period.\nIn 1812, in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812), the eastern half of Moldavia was ceded by the Ottomans to the Russian Empire. The newly acquired territories became known as Bessarabia.\nUnder the Russian government, Chi\u0219in\u0103u became the capital of the newly annexed oblast (later guberniya) of Bessarabia. By 1834, an imperial townscape with broad and long roads had emerged as a result of a generous development plan, which divided Chi\u0219in\u0103u roughly into two areas: the old part of the town, with its irregular building structures, and a newer city centre and station. Between 26 May 1830 and 13 October 1836, the architect Avraam Melnikov established the Catedrala Na\u0219terea Domnului with a magnificent bell tower. In 1840, the building of the Triumphal Arch, planned by the architect Luca Zaushkevich, was completed. Following this, the construction of numerous buildings and landmarks began.\nOn 28 August 1871, Chi\u0219in\u0103u was linked by rail with Tiraspol, and in 1873 with Corne\u0219ti. Chi\u0219in\u0103u-Ungheni-Ia\u0219i railway was opened on 1 June 1875 in preparation for the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878). The town played an important part in the war between Russia and the Ottoman Empire, as the main staging area of the Russian invasion. During the Belle \u00c9poque, the mayor of the city was Carol Schmidt, whose contribution to the modernisation of the city is still commemorated by Moldovans. Its population had grown to 92,000 by 1862, and to 125,787 by 1900.\nPogroms and pre-revolution.\nIn the late 19th century, especially due to growing anti-Semitic sentiment in other parts of the Russian Empire and better economic conditions in Moldova, many Jews chose to settle in Chi\u0219in\u0103u. By the year 1897, 46% of the population of Chi\u0219in\u0103u was Jewish, over 50,000 people.\nAs part of the pogrom wave organized in the Russian Empire, a large anti-Semitic riot was organized in the town on 19\u201320 April 1903, which would later be known as the Kishinev pogrom. The rioting continued for three days, resulting in 47 Jews dead, 92 severely wounded, and 500 suffering minor injuries. In addition, several hundred houses and many businesses were plundered and destroyed. Some sources say 49 people were killed. The pogroms are largely believed to have been incited by anti-Jewish propaganda in the only official newspaper of the time, \"Bessarabetz\" (\"\u0411\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0446\u044a\"). Mayor Schmidt disapproved of the incident and resigned later in 1903. The reactions to this incident included a petition to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia on behalf of the American people by US President Theodore Roosevelt in July 1903.\nOn 22 August 1905, another violent event occurred: the police opened fire on an estimated 3,000 demonstrating agricultural workers. Only a few months later, on 19\u201320 October 1905, a further protest occurred, helping to force the hand of Nicholas II in bringing about the October Manifesto. However, these demonstrations suddenly turned into another anti-Jewish pogrom, resulting in 19 deaths.\nRomanian period.\nFollowing the Russian October Revolution, Bessarabia declared independence from the crumbling empire, as the Moldavian Democratic Republic, before joining the Kingdom of Romania. As of 1919, Chi\u0219in\u0103u, with an estimated population of 133,000, became the second largest city in Romania.\nBetween 1918 and 1940, the city center undertook large renovation work. Romania granted important subsidies to its provinces and initiated large-scale investment programs in the infrastructure of the main cities in Bessarabia, expanded the railroad infrastructure, and launched an extensive program to eradicate illiteracy.\nIn 1927, the Stephen the Great Monument, by the sculptor Alexandru Pl\u0103m\u0103deal\u0103, was erected. In 1933, the first higher education institution in Bessarabia was established by transferring the Agricultural Sciences Section of the University of Ia\u0219i to Chi\u0219in\u0103u, as the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences.\nWorld War II.\nOn 28 June 1940, as a direct result of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Bessarabia was annexed by the Soviet Union from Romania, and Chi\u0219in\u0103u became the capital of the newly created Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nFollowing the Soviet occupation, mass deportations, linked with atrocities, were executed by the NKVD between June 1940 and June 1941. More than 400 people were summarily executed in Chi\u0219in\u0103u in July 1940 and buried in the grounds of the Metropolitan Palace, the Chi\u0219in\u0103u Theological Institute, and the backyard of the Italian Consulate, where the NKVD had established its headquarters. As part of the policy of political repression of the potential opposition to the Communist power, tens of thousands of members of native families were deported from Bessarabia to other regions of the USSR.\nA devastating earthquake occurred on 10\u00a0November 1940, measuring 7.4 (or 7.7, according to other sources) on the Richter scale. The epicenter of the quake was in the Vrancea Mountains, and it led to substantial destruction: 78 deaths and 2,795 damaged buildings (of which 172 were destroyed).\nIn June 1941, in order to recover Bessarabia, Romania entered World War II under the command of the German Wehrmacht, declaring war on the Soviet Union. Chi\u0219in\u0103u was severely affected in the chaos of the Second World War. In June and July 1941, the city came under bombardment by Nazi air raids. However, the Romanian and newly Moldovan sources assign most of the responsibility for the damage to Soviet NKVD destruction battalions, which operated in Chi\u0219in\u0103u until 17 July 1941, when it was captured by Axis forces.\nDuring the German and Romanian military administration, the city suffered from the Nazi extermination policy of its Jewish inhabitants, who were transported on trucks to the outskirts of the city and then summarily shot in partially dug pits. The number of Jews murdered during the initial occupation of the city is estimated at 10,000 people. The deportation of the city's Jews to Transnistria reduced its Jewish population from 11,388 in the fall of 1941 to 177 in 1943; a large majority of the deportees died. During this time, Chi\u0219in\u0103u, part of L\u0103pu\u0219na County, was the capital of the newly established Bessarabia Governorate of Romania.\nAs the war drew to a conclusion, the city was once again the scene of heavy fighting as German and Romanian troops retreated. Chi\u0219in\u0103u was captured by the Red Army on 24 August 1944 as a result of the Second Jassy\u2013Kishinev offensive.\nSoviet period.\nAfter the war, Bessarabia was fully reintegrated into the Soviet Union, with around 65 percent of its territory as the Moldavian SSR, while the remaining 35 percent was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR.\nTwo other waves of deportations of Moldova's native population were carried out by the Soviets, the first one immediately after the Soviet reoccupation of Bessarabia until the end of the 1940s, and the second one in the mid-1950s.\nBetween 1947 and 1949, the architect Alexey Shchusev developed a plan with the aid of a team of architects for the gradual reconstruction of the city.\nThere was rapid population growth in the 1950s, to which the Soviet administration responded by constructing large-scale housing and palaces in the style of Stalinist architecture. This process continued under Nikita Khrushchev, who called for construction under the slogan \"good, cheaper, and built faster.\" The new architectural style brought about dramatic change and generated the style that dominates today, with large blocks of flats arranged in considerable settlements. These Khrushchev-era buildings are often informally called Khrushchyovka.\nThe period of the most significant redevelopment of the city began in 1971, when the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union adopted a decision \"On the measures for further development of the city of Kishinev,\" which secured more than one billion rubles in investment from the state budget, and continued until the independence of Moldova in 1991. The share of dwellings built during the Soviet period (1951\u20131990) represents 74.3 percent of total households.\nOn 4 March 1977, the city was again jolted by a devastating earthquake. Several people were killed, and panic broke out. The Intourist Hotel, a flagship property constructed by the Soviet state-owned travel monopoly of the same name, was completed in 1978.\nOn 22 April 1993, the city inaugurated the Monument to the Victims of Jewish Ghettos, a public monument centred on a bronze statue of the Biblical prophet Moses, which serves as a symbol of remembrance to the thousands of Jews who perished during the holocaust. The monument was designed by architect Simeon Shoihet and sculptor Naum Epelbaum. It stands on Ierusalim Street, marking the site of the main entrance to the Chi\u0219in\u0103u ghetto, which was established in the lower part of the city in July 1941, shortly after the German and Romanian troops occupied the area.\nAfter independence.\nSince Moldovan independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many streets of Chi\u0219in\u0103u have been renamed after historic persons, places, or events. Independence from the Soviet Union was followed by a large-scale renaming of streets and localities from a Communist theme into a national one.\nOn 5 September 2022, the country's first Christian university, Universitatea Moldo-American\u0103, opened its doors, supported by the Scandinavian broadcaster Visjon Norge and several donors in Norway, and run in cooperation with the American Southeastern University in Florida, United States.\nFollowing Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Moldova allowed more than 600,000 Ukrainian civilians to flee Ukraine across their border. Despite being among the poorest states in Europe, Moldova has continued to host more than 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, many of them in Chi\u0219in\u0103u.\nOn 23 November 2022, the Chi\u0219in\u0103u Court of Appeal ruled that Chi\u0219in\u0103u International Airport will return to state ownership, according to justice minister Sergiu Litvinenco, more than three months after an international court allowed Moldova to terminate a 49-year concession deal with airport operator Avia Invest. In April 2023, the Dutch government opened a new embassy in Chi\u0219in\u0103u.\nOn 21 May 2023, tens of thousands of Moldovans took to the streets in a massive rally, the European Moldova National Assembly, to support the country's European Union membership bid. Moldovan police said more than 75,000 demonstrators were present at the rally organised by Moldovan president Maia Sandu.\nLater that month, Chi\u0219in\u0103u hosted a major international summit of the European Political Community organised to discuss the illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine as well as cybersecurity, migration and energy security, and regional issues in Azerbaijan, Armenia, and clashes in Kosovo.\nGeography.\nChi\u0219in\u0103u is located on the river B\u00e2c, a tributary of the Dniester, at , with an area of . The municipality comprises .\nThe city lies in central Moldova and is surrounded by a relatively level landscape with very fertile ground.\nChi\u0219in\u0103u is roughly equidistant between the borders with Romania (58 km) and Ukraine (54 km), and between the northernmost (188 km) and southernmost (179 km) points of Moldova, thus meaning that it is very close to Moldova's geographic centre.\nClimate.\nChi\u0219in\u0103u has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Dfa\") characterised by warm summers and cold, windy winters. Winter minimum temperatures are often below , although they rarely drop below . In summer, the average maximum temperature is approximately , however, temperatures occasionally reach in mid-summer in downtown. Although average humidity during summer is relatively low, most of the annual precipitation occurs during summer, causing infrequent yet heavy storms.\nSpring and autumn temperatures vary between , and precipitation during this time tends to be lower than in summer but with more frequent yet milder periods of rain.\nLaw and government.\nGovernment and politics.\nChi\u0219in\u0103u is governed by the City Council and the Mayor (), both elected once every four years. Ion Ceban was elected mayor first in 2019 and again in 2023. During his first term, he formed a new political party, the National Alternative Movement, of which he was elected president in 2022.\nThe 2023 election also brought in a new city council. The percentages of votes and the resulting number of seats for parties represented in the council are listed below.\nMunicipal administration.\nMoldova is administratively subdivided into 3 municipalities, 32 districts, and 2 autonomous units. With a population of 662,836 inhabitants (as of 2014), the Municipality of Chi\u0219in\u0103u (which includes the nearby communities) is the largest of these municipalities.\nBesides the city itself, the municipality comprises 34 other suburban localities: 6 towns (containing further 2 villages within), and 12 communes (containing further 14 villages within). The population, as of the 2014 Moldovan census, is shown in brackets:\nCommunes.\nAdministrative sectors.\nThe municipality in its totality elects a mayor and a local council, which then name five \"pretors\", one for each sector. They deal more locally with administrative matters. Each sector claims a part of the city and several suburbs:\n* Codru\n* Durle\u0219ti\n* Vatra\n* Condri\u021ba\n* Ghidighici\n* Tru\u0219eni\n** \"Dumbrava\"\n* Cricova\n* Ciorescu\n** \"F\u0103ure\u0219ti\"\n** \"Goian\"\n* Gr\u0103tie\u0219ti\n** \"Hulboaca\"\n* St\u0103uceni\n** \"Goianul Nou\"\n* S\u00eengera\n** \"Dobrogea\"\n** \"Revaca\"\n* B\u0103cioi\n** \"Br\u0103ila\"\n** \"Frumu\u0219ica\"\n** \"Str\u0103isteni\"\n* Vadul lui Vod\u0103\n* Bubuieci\n** \"B\u00eec\"\n** \"Humule\u0219ti\"\n* Bude\u0219ti,\n** \"V\u0103duleni\"\n* Coloni\u021ba\n* Cruze\u0219ti\n** \"Ceroborta\"\n* Tohatin\n** \"Bune\u021bi\"\n** \"Cheltuitori\"\nEconomy.\nHistorically, the city was home to fourteen factories in 1919.

Thus, the GDP per capita of Chi\u0219in\u0103u stood at 227% of the Moldova's average. Chi\u0219in\u0103u has the largest and most developed mass media sector in Moldova, and is home to several related companies ranging from leading television networks and radio stations to major newspapers. All national and international banks (15) have their headquarters located in Chi\u0219in\u0103u.\nNotable sites around Chi\u0219in\u0103u include Cineplex Loteanu, the new malls MallDova, Port Mall, and best-known retailers, such as N1, Linella, Kaufland, Fourchette, and Metro. While many locals continue to shop at the bazaars, many upper class residents and tourists shop at the retail stores and at MallDova. Jumbo, an older mall in the Botanica district, and Sun City, in the centre, are more popular with locals.\nSeveral amusement parks exist around the city. A Soviet-era one is located in the Botanica district, along the three lakes of a major park, which reaches the outskirts of the city centre. Another, the modern Aventura Park, is located farther from the centre. The Chi\u0219in\u0103u State Circus, which used to be in a grand building in the R\u00e2\u0219cani sector, has been inactive for several years due to a poorly funded renovation project.\nDemographics.\nNatural statistics (2015)\nPopulation by sector:\nEthnic composition.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReligion.\nChi\u0219in\u0103u is the seat of the Moldovan Orthodox Church, as well as of the Metropolis of Bessarabia.

In 1836, the construction of the Kishinev Cathedral and its belfry was finished. The belfry was demolished in Soviet times and was rebuilt in 1997. Chi\u0219in\u0103u also displays a tremendous number of Orthodox churches and 19th-century buildings around the city such as Ciuflea Monastery or the Transfiguration Church. Much of the city is made from limestone quarried from Cricova, leaving a famous wine cellar there.\nMany modern-style buildings have been built in the city since 1991. There are many office and shopping complexes that are modern, renovated or newly built, including Kentford, SkyTower, and Uni\u00f3n Fenosa headquarters. However, the old Soviet-style clusters of living blocks are still an extensive feature of the cityscape.\nCulture and education.\nEducation.\nThe city is home to 9 public and 8 private universities, the Academy of Sciences of Moldova, a number of institutions offering high school and 1\u20132 years of college education.

It also includes exhibits on natural history, natural sciences, archaeology, paleontology, geology, and ethnography. The building was designed by the architect Vladimir Tsyganko in a distinctive Moorish architectural style with a signature frontal fa\u00e7ade consisting of a triangular pediment supported by two Doric columns.\nThe National Library of Moldova is also located in Chi\u0219in\u0103u.\nEvents and festivals.\nChi\u0219in\u0103u, as well as Moldova as a whole, still show signs of ethnic culture. Signs that say \"Patria Mea\" (English: My homeland) can be found all over the capital. While few people still wear traditional Moldavian attire, large public events often draw in such original costumes.\n\"Moldova National Wine Day\" and \"Wine Festival\" take place every year in the first weekend of October, in Chi\u0219in\u0103u. The events celebrate the autumn harvest and recognises the country's long history of winemaking, which dates back to at least 3,000 BCE. Moldova has been called the wine capital of Europe and its yearly festival is a major cultural and tourist event, and every year the streets are filled with people enjoying food, wine, dance, and music taking over the streets. Moldova's most-awarded sommelier Mihai Druta has described Moldovan wine as being about \"small producers and family wineries making premium wine. And nothing costs more than 100 Euro a bottle.\" \"The Daily Express\" in 2019 described the city as \"Europe's latest hotspot\" in which journalist Maisha Frost praised \"its wines, monumental wineries and their epic tasting sessions.\"\nMedia.\nThe majority of Moldova's media industry is based in Chi\u0219in\u0103u.

Due to the simmering conflict between Moldova and the unrecognised Transnistria republic the rail traffic towards Ukraine is occasionally stopped.\nPublic transport.\nTrolleybuses.\nThere is a wide trolleybus network operating as common public transportation within the city. From 1994, Chi\u0219in\u0103u saw the establishment of new trolleybus lines, as well as an increase in capacity of existing lines, to improve connections between the urban districts.

The Colombo metropolitan area is estimated to have a population of 5.6\u00a0million, and 752,993 within the municipal limits. It is the financial centre of the island and a tourist destination. It is located on the west coast of the island. It is also the administrative capital of the Western Province and the district capital of Colombo District. Colombo is a busy and vibrant city with a mixture of modern life, colonial buildings and monuments.\nIt was made the capital of the island when Sri Lanka was ceded to the British Empire in 1815, retaining its capital status when Sri Lanka gained independence in 1948. In 1978, when administrative functions were moved to Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, Colombo was designated as the commercial capital of Sri Lanka.\nEtymology.\nThe name 'Colombo', first introduced by the Portuguese explorers in 1505, is believed to be derived from the classical Sinhala name , \"Kolon thota\", meaning \"port on the river Kelani\".\nAnother belief is that the name is derived from the Sinhala name , \"Kola-amba-thota\" which means 'Harbour with leafy/green mango trees'.\nThe author of the oldest Sinhala grammar, \"Sidatsangarava,\" written in the 13th century wrote about a category of words that exclusively belonged to early Sinhala. It lists \"naramba\" (to see) and \"kolamba\" (fort or harbour) as deriving from the indigenous Vedda language. \"Kolamba\" may also be the source of the name of the commercial capital Colombo.\nHistory.\nTraveller Ibn Battuta who visited the island in the 14th century, referred to it as \"Kalanpu\". Arabs, whose primary interests were trade, began to settle in Colombo around the eighth century AD mostly because the port helped their business by the way of controlling much of the trade between the Sinhalese kingdoms and the outside world. It was popularly believed that their descendants comprised the local Sri Lankan Moor community, but their genetics are predominantly South Indian.\nPortuguese era.\nPortuguese explorers led by Dom Louren\u00e7o de Almeida first arrived in Sri Lanka in 1505. During their initial visit they made a treaty with the King of Kotte, Parakramabahu VIII (1484\u20131518), which enabled them to trade in the island's crop of cinnamon, which lay along with the coastal areas of the island, including in Colombo. As part of the treaty, the Portuguese were given full authority over the coastline in exchange for the promise of guarding the coast against invaders. They were allowed to establish a trading post in Colombo. Within a short time, however, they expelled the Muslim inhabitants of Colombo and began to build a fort in 1517.\nThe Portuguese soon realised that control of Sri Lanka was necessary for the protection of their coastal establishments in India, and they began to manipulate the rulers of the Kotte kingdom to gain control of the area. After skilfully exploiting rivalries within the royal family, they took control of a large area of the kingdom and the Sinhalese King Mayadunne established a new kingdom at Sitawaka, a domain in the Kotte kingdom. Before long he annexed much of the Kotte kingdom and forced the Portuguese to retreat to Colombo, which was repeatedly besieged by Mayadunne and the later kings of Sitawaka, forcing them to seek reinforcement from their major base in Goa, India. Following the fall of the kingdom in 1593, the Portuguese were able to establish complete control over the coastal area, with Colombo as their capital. This part of Colombo is still known as Fort and houses the presidential palace and the majority of Colombo's five star hotels. The area immediately outside Fort is known as Pettah (, \"pi\u1e6da ko\u1e6duva\", \"outer fort\") and is a commercial hub.\nDutch era.\nIn 1638 the Dutch signed a treaty with King Rajasinha II of Kandy which assured the king assistance in his war against the Portuguese in exchange for a monopoly of the island's major trade goods. The Portuguese resisted the Dutch and the Kandyans but were gradually defeated in their strongholds beginning in 1639. The Dutch captured Colombo in 1656 after an epic siege, at the end of which a mere 93 Portuguese survivors were given safe conduct out of the fort. Although the Dutch (e.g., Rijcklof van Goens) initially restored the captured area back to the Sinhalese kings, they later refused to turn them over and gained control over the island's richest cinnamon lands including Colombo which then served as the capital of the Dutch maritime provinces under the control of the Dutch East India Company until 1796.\nBritish era.\nAlthough the British captured Colombo in 1796, it remained a British military outpost until the Kandyan Kingdom was ceded to them in 1815 and they made Colombo the capital of their newly created crown colony of British Ceylon. Unlike the Portuguese and Dutch before them, whose primary use of Colombo was as a military fort, the British began constructing houses and other civilian structures around the fort, giving rise to the current City of Colombo.\nInitially, they placed the administration of the city under a \"Collector\", and John Macdowell of the Madras Service was the first to hold the office. Then, in 1833, the Government Agent of the Western Province was charged with the administration of the city. Centuries of colonial rule had meant a decline of indigenous administration of Colombo and in 1865 the British conceived a Municipal Council as a means of training the local population in self-governance. The Legislative Council of Ceylon constituted the Colombo Municipal Council in 1865 and the Council met for the first time on 16 January 1866. At the time, the population of the region was around 80,000.\nDuring the time they were in control of Colombo, the British were responsible for much of the planning of the present city. In some parts of the city, tram car tracks and granite flooring laid during the era are still visible today.\nAfter independence.\nThis era of colonialism ended peacefully in 1948 when Ceylon gained independence from Britain. Due to the tremendous impact this caused on the city's inhabitants and on the country as a whole, the changes that resulted at the end of the colonial period were drastic. An entire new culture took root. Changes in laws and customs, clothing styles, religions and proper names were a significant result of the colonial era. These cultural changes were followed by the strengthening of the island's economy. Even today, the influence of the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British is visible in Colombo's architecture, names, clothing, food, language and attitudes. Buildings from all three eras stand as reminders of the turbulent past of Colombo. The city and its people show an interesting mix of European clothing and lifestyles together with local customs.\nHistorically, Colombo referred to the area around the \"Fort\" and \"Pettah Market\" which is known for the variety of products available as well as the Khan Clock Tower, a local landmark. At present, it refers to the city limits of the Colombo Municipal Council. More often, the name is used for the Conurbation known as Greater Colombo, which encompasses several Municipal councils including Kotte, Dehiwela and Colombo.\nAlthough Colombo lost its status as the capital of Sri Lanka in the 1980s to Sri Jayawardanapura, it continues to be the island's commercial centre. Despite the official capital of Sri Lanka moving to the adjacent Sri Jayawardanapura Kotte, most countries still maintain their diplomatic missions in Colombo.\nGeography.\nThe geography of Colombo consists of both land and water. The city has many canals and, in the heart of the city, the Beira Lake. The lake is one of the most distinctive landmarks of Colombo and was used for centuries by colonists to defend the city. It remains a tourist attraction, hosting regattas, and theatrical events on its shores. The northern and north-eastern border of the city of Colombo is formed by the Kelani River, which meets the sea in a part of the city known as the Modera (\"m\u014ddara\" in Sinhala) which means river delta.\nClimate.\nColombo features a tropical rainforest climate (\"Af\"). Colombo's climate is hot throughout the year. From March to April the average high temperature is around . The only major change in the Colombo weather occurs during the monsoon seasons from April to June and September to November, when heavy rains occur. Colombo sees little relative diurnal range of temperature, although this is more marked in the drier winter months, where minimum temperatures average . Rainfall in the city averages around a year.\nAttractions.\nGalle Face Green is located in the heart of the city along the Indian Ocean coast and is a destination for tourists and residents alike. The Galle Face Hotel is a historic landmark on the southern edge of this promenade.\nGangaramaya Temple is one of the most important temples in Colombo. The temple's architecture demonstrates an eclectic mix of Sri Lankan, Thai, Indian and Chinese architecture.\nThe Viharamahadevi Park (formerly Victoria Park) is an urban park located next to the National Museum of Colombo and the Town Hall. It is the oldest and largest park in Colombo and features a large Buddha statue.\nAs part of the Urban Regeneration Program of the Government of Sri Lanka, many old sites and buildings were revamped into modern public recreational spaces and shopping precincts. These include Independence Memorial Hall Square, Pettah Floating Market and Old Dutch Hospital, among others.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nColombo is a multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural city. The population of Colombo is a mix of numerous ethnic groups, mainly Sinhalese, Sri Lankan Moor and Sri Lankan Tamils, . There are also small communities of people with Chinese, Portuguese Burgher, Dutch Burgher, Malay and Indian origins living in the city, as well as numerous European expatriates. Colombo is the most populous city in Sri Lanka, with 642,163 people living within the city limits. In 1866 the city had a population of around 80,000.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGovernment and politics.\nLocal government.\nColombo is a charter city, with a mayor-council government. The mayor and council members are elected through local government elections held once in five years. For the past 50 years the city had been ruled by the United National Party (UNP), a right leaning party, whose business-friendly policies resonate with the population of Colombo. However, the UNP nomination list for the 2006 Municipal elections was rejected, and an Independent Group supported by the UNP won the elections. Uvais Mohamed Imitiyas was subsequently appointed Mayor of Colombo.\nThe city government provides sewer, road and waste management services to the residents. In the case of water, electricity and telephone utility services, the council liaises with the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and telephone service providers operating in the country respectively.\nNational capital status.\nColombo was the capital of the coastal areas controlled by the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British from the 1700s to 1815 when the British gained control of the entire island following the Kandyan convention. From then until the 1980s the national capital of the island was Colombo.\nDuring the 1980s plans were made to move the administrative capital to Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte and thus move all governmental institutions out of Colombo to make way for commercial activities. As a primary step, the Parliament was moved to a new complex in Kotte, with several ministries and departments also relocated. However, the move was never completed.\nToday, many governmental institutions still remain in Colombo. These include the President's House, Presidential Secretariat, Prime Minister's House (Temple Trees), Prime Minister's Office, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, important government ministries and departments; such as Finance (Treasury), Defence, Public Administration &amp; Home affairs, Foreign affairs, Justice and the Military headquarters, Naval headquarters (SLNS Parakrama), Air Force headquarters (SLAF Colombo) and Police national and field force headquarters.\nSuburbs and postal codes.\nCity limits.\nColombo is divided into 15 numbered areas for the purposes of postal services. Within these areas are the suburbs with their corresponding post office.\nEconomy.\nThe great majority of Sri Lankan corporations have their head offices in Colombo including Aitken Spence, Ceylinco Corporation, Stassen group of companies, John Keells Holdings, Cargills, Hemas Holdings, SenzMate and Akbar Brothers. Some of the industries include chemicals, textiles, glass, cement, leather goods, furniture and jewellery. In the city centre is the World Trade Centre. The 40-story Twin Tower complex is the centre of important commercial establishments, in the Fort district, the city's nerve centre. Right outside the Fort area is Pettah which is derived from the Sinhala word \"pita\" which means 'out' or 'outside'.\nThe Colombo Metropolitan area has a GDP (PPP) of $122\u00a0billion or 40% of the GDP, making it the most important aspect of the Sri Lankan economy. The per capita income of the Colombo Metro area stood at US$8623 and purchasing power per capita of $25,117, making it one of the most prosperous regions in South Asia. The Colombo Metropolitan (CM) area is the most important industrial, commercial and administrative centre in Sri Lanka. A major share of the country's export-oriented manufacturing takes place in the CM area, which is the engine of growth for Sri Lanka.\n The Western province contributes less than 40% to the GDP and about 80% of industrial value additions although it accounts for only 5.7% of the country's geographic area and 25% of the national population. Given its importance as the primary international gateway for Sri Lanka and as the main economic driver of the country, the government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) has launched an ambitious program to transform Colombo and its area into a metropolis of international standards. Bottlenecks are preventing the Colombo metropolitan area from realizing its full economic potential. To facilitate the transformation of Colombo, the government has to address these bottlenecks which have for long been obstructing economic and physical urban regeneration.\nPettah is more crowded than the Fort area. Pettah's roads are always packed and pavements are full of small stalls selling items from delicious sharbat to shirts. Main Street consists mostly of clothes shops and the crossroads, which are known as Cross-Streets where each of the five streets specialises in a specific business. For example, First Cross Street is mostly electronic goods shops, the Second cellular phones and fancy goods. Most of these businesses are dominated by Muslim traders. At the end of Main Street further away from Fort is Sea Street \u2013 Sri Lanka's gold market \u2013 dominated by Tamil interests. This mile-long street is full of jewellery shops, including the former head office of SriLankan Airlines.\nLaw enforcement and crime.\nThe Sri Lanka Police, the main law enforcement agency of the island, liaise with the municipal council but is under the control of the Ministry of Defence of the central government. Policing in Colombo and its suburbs falls within the \"Metropolitan Range\" headed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police (Metropolitan), this also includes the Colombo Crime Division. As with most Sri Lankan cities, the magistrate court handles felony crimes while the district court handles civil cases. \nAs in other large cities around the world, Colombo experiences certain levels of street crime and bribery. Indeed, the corruption extends to the very top, US reports show. In addition, in the period from the 1980s to 2009, there have been a number of major terrorist attacks. The LTTE has been linked to most of the bombings and assassinations in the city. Welikada Prison is situated in Colombo and it is one of the largest maximum-security prisons in the country.\nInfrastructure.\nColombo has most of the amenities that a modern city has. Compared to other parts of the country, Colombo has the highest degree of infrastructure. Electricity, water and transport to street lights and phone booths are to a considerably good standard. Apart from that, many luxurious hotels, clubs and restaurants are in the city. In recent times there has been an outpour of high-rise condominiums, mainly due to the very high land prices.\nHarbour.\nColombo Harbour is the largest and one of the busiest ports in Sri Lanka. Colombo was established primarily as a port city during the colonial era, with an artificial harbour that has been expanded over the years. The Sri Lanka Navy maintains a naval base, \"SLNS Rangalla\", within the harbour.\nThe Port of Colombo handled 3.75\u00a0million twenty-foot equivalent units in 2008, 10.6% up on 2007 (which itself was 9.7% up on 2006), bucking the global economic trend. Of those, 817,000 were local shipments with the rest transshipments. With a capacity of 5.7\u00a0million TEUs and a dredged depth of over 15\u00a0m (49\u00a0ft), the Colombo Harbour is one of the busiest ports in the world and ranks among the top 25 ports (23rd). Sri Lanka's Port of Colombo is said to be the busiest, largest port in the Indian Ocean.\nColombo is part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to the Upper Adriatic region with its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe.\nTransport.\nBus.\nColombo has an extensive public transport system based on buses operated both by private operators and the government-owned Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB). The three primary bus terminals \u2013 Bastian Mawatha, Central and the Gunasinghapura Bus Terminals \u2013 are in Pettah. Bastian Mawatha handles long-distance services whereas Gunasinghapura and Central handle local services.\nRail.\nTrain transport in the city is limited since most trains are meant for transport to and from the city rather than within it and are often overcrowded. However, the Central Bus Stand and Fort Railway Station function as the island's primary hub for bus and rail transport respectively. Up until the 1970s, the city had tram services, which were discontinued. Other means of transport include auto rickshaws (commonly called \"three-wheelers\") and taxicabs. Three-wheelers are entirely operated by individuals and hardly regulated whilst cab services are run by private companies and are metered.\nRoads.\nPost-war development in the Colombo area also involves the construction of numerous expressway grade arterial road routes. The first of these constructed is the Southern Expressway, which goes from Kottawa, a southern suburb of Colombo, to Matara City in the south of the country. Expressways constructed in the Colombo metropolitan area include the Colombo\u2013Katunayake Expressway, which was opened in October 2013 and the Colombo orbital bypass Outer Circular Highway (Arthur C. Clarke Expressway). The Colombo-Katunayake Expressway (E03) runs from Peliyagoda, a northern suburb of Colombo, to Colombo International Airport and it is linked with one of the major commercial hubs and a major tourist destination of the country, the city of Negombo.\nFerry.\nAn international ferry liner, the Scotia Prince, is conducting a ferry service to Tuticorin, India. Ferry services between the two countries have been revived after more than 20 years.\nAir.\nRatmalana Airport is the city's airport, located south of the city centre. It commenced operating in 1935 and was the country's first international airport until it was replaced by Bandaranaike Airport in 1967. Ratmalana Airport now primarily services domestic flights, aviation training and international corporate flights.\nLandmarks.\nThe two World Trade Centre towers used to be the most recognised landmarks of the city. Before they were completed in 1997, the adjacent Bank of Ceylon tower was the tallest structure and the most prominent city landmark. Before the skyscrapers were built, the Old Parliament Building that stood in the Fort district with the Old Colombo Lighthouse close to it used to be the tallest building. Another important landmark is the Independence Hall at Independence Square in Cinnamon Gardens.\nAnother landmark is St.Paul's Church Milagiriya, one of the oldest churches in Sri Lanka, first built by the Portuguese and rebuilt by the British in 1848. The Cargills &amp; Millers building in Fort is also a protected building of historical significance.\nCannons that were once mounted on the rampart of the old fort of Colombo were laid out for observance and prestige at the Green. The colonial styled Galle Face Hotel, known as Asia's Emerald on the Green since 1864, is adjacent to Galle Face Green. The hotel has played host to guests such as the British royal family and other royal guests and celebrities. After a stay at the hotel, Princess Alexandra of Denmark commented that \"the peacefulness and generosity encountered at the Galle Face Hotel cannot be matched.\" Also facing Galle Face Green is the Ceylon Inter-Continental Hotel.\nEducation.\nEducation institutions in Colombo have a long history. Colombo has many of the prominent public schools in the country, some of them government-owned and others private. Most of the prominent schools in the city date back to the 1800s when they were established during the British colonial rule, such as the Royal College Colombo established in 1835. Certain urban schools of Sri Lanka have some religious alignment; this is partly due to the influence of the British, who established Christian missionary schools. These include the Anglican, Bishop's College(1875); the Methodist, Wesley College Colombo (1874); the Buddhist, Ananda College (1886); the Muslim, Zahira College (1892); the Catholic, St. Benedict's College, Colombo (1865),St. Joseph's College (1896). The religious alignments do not affect the curriculum of the school except for the demographics of the student population. The secular schools Mahanama College (1954), D. S. Senanayake College (1967), and Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya (1973) have been established in the post independence era. Colombo has many International Schools that have come up in recent years.\nHigher education in the city has a long history, beginning with the establishment of the Colombo Medical School (1870), the Colombo Law College (1875), the School of Agriculture (1884) and the Government Technical College (1893). The first step in the creation of a university in Colombo was taken in 1913 with the establishment of the University College Colombo which prepared students for the external examinations of the University of London. This was followed by the establishment of the University of Ceylon in Colombo. Today the University of Colombo and the University of the Visual &amp; Performing Arts are state universities in the city. The Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology has a metropolitan campus in the city centre. There are several private higher education institutions in the city.\nArchitecture.\nColombo has widely varying architecture that spans centuries and depicts many styles. Colonial buildings influenced by the Portuguese, Dutch and British exist alongside structures built in Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Indian and Contemporary architectural styles. No other place is this more evident than in the Fort area. Here, one may find new, towering skyscrapers as well as historic buildings dating far back as the 1700s.\nColombo Fort.\nThe Portuguese were the first colonists to settle in Colombo. Establishing a small trading post, they had laid the foundations for a small fort which in time became the largest colonial fort on the island. The Dutch expanded the fort, thus creating a well fortified harbour. This came into the possession of the British in the late 1700s, and by the late 19th century, seeing no threat to the Colombo Harbour, began demolishing the ramparts to make way for the development of the city. Although now there is nothing left of the fortifications, the area which was once the fort is still referred to as Fort. The area outside is Pettah, Sri Lanka or \"Pitakotuwa\" in Sinhala which means outer fort.\nDutch-era buildings.\nThere are none of the buildings of the Portuguese era and only a few from the Dutch period. These include the oldest building in the fort area, the former Dutch Hospital, the Dutch House which is now the Colombo Dutch Museum and several churches. The President's House (formerly the Queen's House) was originally the Dutch governor's house and successive British governors made it their office and residence. However, it has undergone much change since the Dutch period. Adjoining the President's House are the Gordon Gardens, now off-limits to the public.\nBritish-era buildings.\nMuch of the old buildings of the fort area and in other parts of the city date back to British times; these include governmental, commercial buildings, and private houses. Some of the notable government building of British colonial architecture includes the old Parliament building, which is now the Presidential Secretariat; the Republic Building, which houses the Ministry of Foreign affairs but once housed the Ceylon Legislative council; the General Treasury Building; the old General Post Office, an Edwardian-style building opposite the President's House; the Prime Minister's Office; the Central Telegraph Office; and the Mathematics department of the University of Colombo (formally the Royal College, Colombo). Notable commercial buildings of the British era include the Galle Face Hotel, Cargills and Millers' complex, and the Grand Oriental Hotel.\nCulture.\nAnnual cultural events and fairs.\nColombo's most popular festival is the celebration of Buddha's birth, enlightenment and death all falling on the same day. In Sinhala this is known as \"Vesak\". During this festival, much of the city is decorated with lanterns, lights and special displays of light (known as \"thoran\"). The festival falls in mid-May and lasts a week. Many Sri Lankans visit the city to see the lantern competitions and decorations. During this week people distribute, rice, drinks and other food items for free in \"dunsal\" which means charity place. These \"dunsal\" are popular amongst visitors from the suburbs.\nSince there is a large number of Muslims in Colombo. Eid Ul Fitr and Eid Ul Adha are two Islamic festivals that are celebrated in Colombo. Many businesses flourish during the eventual countdown for Eid Ul Fitr which is a major Islamic festival celebrated by Muslims after a month-long fasting. Colombo is generally very busy on the eve of the festivals as people do their last-minute shopping.\nChristmas is another major festival. Although Sri Lanka's Christians make up only just over 7% of the population, Christmas is one of the island's biggest festivals. Most streets and commercial buildings light up from the beginning of December and festive sales begin at all shopping centres and department stores. Caroling and nativity plays are frequent sights during the season.\nThe Sinhalese and Hindu Aluth Awurudda' is a cultural event that takes place on 13 and 14 April. This is the celebration of the Sinhalese and Hindu new year. The festivities include many events and traditions that display a great deal of Sri Lankan culture.\nSeveral old clubs of the city give a glimpse of the British equestrian lifestyle; these include the Colombo Club, Orient Club, the 80 Club, and the Colombo Cricket Club.\nPerforming arts.\nColombo has several performing arts centres, which are popular for their musical and theatrical performances, including the Lionel Wendt Theatre, the Elphinstone, and Tower Hall, all of which were made for western-style productions. The Navarangahala found in the city is the country's first national theatre designed and built for Asian and local style musical and theatrical productions.\nThe Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre is a world-class theatre that opened in December 2011. Designed in the form of the Lotus Pond in Polonnaruwa, the theatre is a major theatre destination.\nMuseums and art collections.\nThe National Museum of Colombo, established on 1 January 1877 during the tenure of the British Colonial Governor Sir William Henry Gregory, is in the Cinnamon Gardens area. The museum houses the crown jewels and throne of the last king of the kingdom of Kandy, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha.\nThere is also the Colombo Dutch Museum detailing the Dutch colonial history of the country. Colombo does not boast a very big art gallery. There is a small collection of random Sri Lankan paintings at the Art Gallery in Green Path; next to it is the Natural History Museum.\nSports.\nOne of the most popular sports in Sri Lanka is cricket. The country emerged as champions of the 1996 Cricket World Cup and became runners up in 2007 and 2011. In the ICC World Twenty20 they became runners up in 2009 and 2012 and winners in 2014. The sport is played in parks, playgrounds, beaches and even in the streets. Colombo is the home for two of the country's most popular international cricket stadiums, Singhalese Sports Club's Cricket Stadium and R. Premadasa Stadium (named after late president Premadasa). Colombo Stars represents the city in Lanka Premier League.\nColombo has the distinction of being the only city in the world to have four cricket test venues in the past: Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium, Singhalese Sports Club Cricket Ground, Colombo Cricket Club Ground and Ranasinghe Premadasa Stadium. The Sugathadasa Stadium is an international standard stadium for athletics, swimming and football, also held the South Asian Games in 1991 and 2006. Situated in Colombo the Royal Colombo Golf Club is one of the oldest in Asia. Other sporting clubs in Colombo include Colombo Swimming Club, Colombo Rowing Club and the Yachting Association of Sri Lanka.\nRugby is also a popular sport at the club and school levels. Colombo has its local football team Colombo FC and the sport is being developed as a part of the FIFA Goal program.\nThe Colombo Port City is to include a new Formula One track, constructed in the vicinity of the Colombo Harbour. According to Dr Priyath Wickrama, the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, an eight-lane F1 track will \"definitely\" be a part of the New Port City. This would host the Sri Lankan Grand Prix.\nColombo Marathon is an internationally recognised marathon established in 1998.\nMedia.\nAlmost all major media businesses in Sri Lanka operate from Colombo. The state media has its offices in Bullers Road and carries out regional transmissions from there. These include the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC), formerly known as Radio Ceylon, and the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation. The SLBC is the oldest radio station in South Asia and the second oldest in the world. Many private broadcasting companies have their offices and transmission stations in or around Colombo. As with most metro areas, radio bands are highly utilised for radio communications. Some of the prominent radio stations broadcasting in the Colombo area are Sirasa FM, FM Derana, Hiru FM, Shakthi FM, Vettri FM, Sooriyan FM, Kiss FM, Lite FM, Yes FM, Gold FM, Sith FM, Y FM, E FM and many more.\nTelevision networks operating in the Colombo metro area include the state-owned television broadcasting networks which are broadcast by the Rupavahini Corporation of Sri Lanka, broadcasting television in the official languages Sinhala and Tamil. English language television is also broadcast, more targeted to the demographics of the English speaking Sri Lankans, expatriate communities and tourists. There are as well several private operators. Many of the privately run television station networks were often based upon operational expansions of pre-existing commercial radio networks and broadcast infrastructure.\nNotable people.\nSee \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nThe following books contain major components on Colombo:"}
{"id": "56637", "revid": "35576730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56637", "title": "Ammonium perchlorate", "text": "&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nAmmonium perchlorate (\"AP\") is an inorganic compound with the formula . It is a colorless or white solid that is soluble in water. It is a powerful oxidizer and a major component of ammonium perchlorate composite propellant. Its instability has involved it in accidents such as the PEPCON disaster, and has been suspected as the cause of the Port of Shahid Rajaee explosion.\nProduction.\nAmmonium perchlorate (AP) is produced by reaction between ammonia and perchloric acid. This process is the main outlet for the industrial production of perchloric acid. The salt also can be produced by salt metathesis reaction of ammonium salts with sodium perchlorate. This process exploits the relatively low solubility of , which is about 10% of that for sodium perchlorate.\nAP crystallises as colorless rhombohedra.\nDecomposition.\nLike most ammonium salts, ammonium perchlorate decomposes before melting:\nThe combustion of AP is quite complex and is widely studied. AP crystals decompose before melting, even though a thin liquid layer has been observed on crystal surfaces during high-pressure combustion processes. Strong heating may lead to explosions. Complete reactions leave no residue. Pure crystals cannot sustain a flame below the pressure of .\nAP is a Class 4 oxidizer (can undergo an explosive reaction) for particle sizes over 15 micrometres and is classified as an explosive for particle sizes less than 15 micrometres.\nApplications.\nDuring World War I England and France used mixtures featuring ammonium perchlorate (such as \"perammons\") as a substitute high explosive.\nThe primary use of ammonium perchlorate is in making solid rocket propellants. When AP is mixed with a fuel (like a powdered aluminium and/or with an elastomeric binder), it can generate self-sustained combustion at pressures far below atmospheric pressure. It is an important oxidizer with a decades-long history of use in composite rocket propellants (including the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster), military, amateur, and hobbyist high-power rockets, as well as in some fireworks.\nToxicity.\nPerchlorate itself confers little acute toxicity. For example, sodium perchlorate has an LD50 of 2\u20134g/kg and is eliminated rapidly after ingestion. However, chronic exposure to perchlorates, even in low concentrations, has been shown to cause various thyroid problems, as it is taken up in place of iodine.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A port city, it serves as the economic, financial and cultural centre of Guinea. Its population as of the 2014 Guinea census was 1,660,973.\nThe population of Conakry is difficult to ascertain. The U.S. Department of State's Bureau of African Affairs has estimated it at 2 million, or one-sixth of the country's population.\nHistory.\nConakry was originally settled on the small Tombo Island and later spread to the neighboring Kaloum Peninsula, a stretch of land wide. The city was essentially founded after Britain ceded the island to France in 1887. In 1885, the two island villages of Conakry and Boubinet had fewer than 500 inhabitants. Conakry became the capital of French Guinea in 1904, and prospered as an export port, particularly after a railway (now closed) to Kankan opened up the interior of the country for the large-scale export of groundnut.\nIn the decades after Guinea gained independence in 1958, the population of Conakry boomed, from 50,000 inhabitants in 1958 to 600,000 in 1980 to more than 2 million today. The city's small land area and relative isolation from the mainland, while an advantage to its colonial founders, has created an infrastructural burden since independence.\nIn 1970, conflict between Portuguese forces and the belligerent PAIGC independence campaigners in neighbouring Portuguese Guinea (now Guinea-Bissau) spilled into the Republic of Guinea when a group of 350 Portuguese troops and Guinean loyalists landed near the capital Conakry, attacked the city and freed 26 Portuguese prisoners of war held by the PAIGC before retreating, having failed to overthrow the government or kill the PAIGC leadership.\nCamp Boiro, a feared concentration camp during the rule of Sekou Toure, was located in Conakry.\nAccording to human rights groups, 157 people died during the 2009 Guinea protest when the military junta opened fire against tens of thousands of protesters in the city on 28 September 2009.\nGeography.\nOriginally situated on Tombo Island, one of the \u00celes de Los, it has since spread up the neighboring Kaloum Peninsula.\nClimate.\nAccording to K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Conakry features a tropical monsoon climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Am\"). Conakry features a wet season and a dry season. Like most of West Africa, Conakry's dry season is dominated by the harmattan wind between December and April. As a result, almost no rain falls in the city during these months.\nCompared to most of West Africa, Conakry's wet season sees an extraordinary amount of rainfall, averaging more than in both July and August. As a result, Conakry's average annual rainfall totals nearly . However, the dry season is still dry, with January and February only receiving of rainfall on average. Sunshine is lower in the wet season than the dry season, with August receiving the least sunshine and March receiving the most.\nPopulation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGovernment and administration.\nConakry is a special city with a single region and prefecture government. The local government of the city was decentralized in 1991 between five municipal \"communes\" headed by a mayor. From the tip in the southwest, these are:\nThe five urban communes make up the Conakry Region, one of the eight Regions of Guinea, which is headed by a governor. At the second-tier prefecture level, the city is designated as the Conakry Special Zone, though the prefecture and regional government are one and the same. At an estimated two million inhabitants, it is far and away the largest city in Guinea, making up almost a quarter of the nation's population and making it more than four times bigger than its nearest rival, Kankan.\nEconomy.\nConakry is Guinea's largest city and its administrative, communications, and economic centre. The city's economy revolves largely around the port, which has modern facilities for handling and storing cargo, through which alumina and bananas are shipped. Manufactures include food products and cement, metal manufactures, and fuel products.\nInfrastructure crisis.\nPeriodic power and water cuts have been a daily burden for Conakry's residents since early 2002. Government and power company officials blame the drought of February 2001 for a failure of the hydro-electric supply to the capital, and a failure of aging machinery for the continuation of the crisis. Critics of the government cite mismanagement, corruption and the withdrawal of the power agency's French partner at the beginning of 2002. As of 2007[ [update]], much of the city has no traffic lighting in the overnight hours.\nPopular anger at shortages in Conakry was entwined with anti-government protests, strikes, and violence against the rule of President Lansana Cont\u00e9 and the successive prime ministers Cellou Dalein Diallo and Eug\u00e8ne Camara appointed to fill the post after the resignation of Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Lonseny Fall in April 2004. Violence reached a peak in January\u2013February 2007 in a general strike, which saw over one hundred deaths when the Army confronted protesters.\nTransportation.\nConakry is serviced by Conakry International Airport which has flights to several cities in West Africa and Europe.\nCulture.\nPlaces of worship.\nIslamic mosques in the city include the Grand Mosque of Conakry. There are also Christian churches and temples, including the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Conakry's Cath\u00e9drale Sainte-Marie, the \u00c9glise Protestante \u00c9vang\u00e9lique de Guin\u00e9e (Alliance World Fellowship), and the Assemblies of God.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its official population count was 679,012 in 2012; however, over two million people live in the larger urban area. The urban area continues to expand, notably toward the west. The city lies in the southeast of the country, between the Atlantic Ocean and Lake Nokou\u00e9.\nCotonou is the seat of government of the Republic of Benin, where most of the government buildings are situated, government departments operate and foreign embassies are located, but the official capital, where the national legislature sits, is the smaller city of Porto-Novo.\nHistory.\nThe name \"Cotonou\" means \"by the river of death\" in the Fon language. At the beginning of the 19th century, Cotonou (then spelled \"Kutonou\") was a small fishing village, and is thought to have been formally founded by King Ghezo of Dahomey in 1830. It grew as a centre for the slave trade, and later palm oil and cotton. In 1851 the French Second Republic made a treaty with King Ghezo that allowed them to establish a trading post at Cotonou. During the reign of King Glele (1858\u201389), the territory was ceded to the Second French Empire by a treaty signed in 1878. In 1883, the French Navy occupied the city to prevent British conquest of the area.\nAfter Glele's death in 1889, King B\u00e9hanzin unsuccessfully tried to challenge the treaty. The town grew rapidly following the building of the harbour in 1908.\nThe population in 1960 was only 70,000.\nGeography.\nCotonou is on the coastal strip between Lake Nokou\u00e9 and the Atlantic Ocean. The city is cut in two by a canal, the lagoon of Cotonou, dug by the French in 1855. Three bridges are in this area. The Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River flows into the Atlantic Ocean at Cotonou.\nThe city has established transportation infrastructure including air, sea, river (to Porto Novo), and land routes that facilitate trade with its neighbors Nigeria, Niger, Burkina Faso and Togo.\nCoastal erosion has been noted for several decades. It worsened in 1961 following construction of the Nangbeto Dam and deep-water port of Cotonou. A pilot project funded by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) revealed that in 40 years, the coast to the east of Cotonou had retreated by 400 meters. This erosion has led many people to leave their homes along the coast.\nClimate.\nUnder K\u00f6ppen's climate classification, Cotonou features a tropical wet and dry climate, alternating with two rainy seasons (April\u2013July and September\u2013October, totalling of rain per year) and two dry seasons. In December and January, the city is affected by harmattan winds. Temperatures are relatively constant throughout the year, with the average high temperatures hovering around , and average low temperatures at around .\nDemographics.\nFrench is the official language of Benin. Other languages spoken in Cotonou include Fon, Aja and Yoruba.\nTransport.\nThe Autonomous Port of Cotonou is one of the largest in West Africa. The city is connected to Parakou in the north by the Benin-Niger railway. Cotonou International Airport provides service to the capitals of the region and to France, as well as the major cities of Benin: Parakou, Kandi, Natitingou, Djougou, and Sav\u00e9. There are road connections to neighboring countries: Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Togo. A prevalent mode of transport in the city is the motorcycle-taxi, known locally as z\u00e9midjan.\nIn 2015 a suburban passenger railway line was being developed between Cotonou and Pahou.\nEconomy.\nImportant manufactured goods include palm oil, brewing, textiles, and cement.\nMotor vehicles and bicycles are assembled, and there are sawmills in the city. Petroleum products, bauxite, and iron are major exports. There are offshore platforms drilling for oil. The city is a centre for the automotive trade, with European brands being sold from vast open-air parking lots. In the past, Citro\u00ebn assembled cars (for instance, the Citro\u00ebn\u00a02CV and Ami\u00a08) locally.\nBy 2012, piracy in the Gulf of Guinea had significantly decreased trade at the port of Cotonou.\nIn the Miss\u00e8bo area is a textile market of African prints mainly handled by Indian wholesalers and retailers.\nThe 12th arrondissement, between Boulevard de la Marina and the Atlantic Ocean, is the site of the second tallest statue in Africa, honoring the Dahomey Amazons.\nPlaces of worship.\nAmong the places of worship, Christian churches are predominant: Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cotonou (Catholic Church), Protestant Methodist Church in Benin (World Methodist Council), Union of Baptist Churches of Benin (Baptist World Alliance), Living Faith Church Worldwide, Redeemed Christian Church of God, Assemblies of God. There are also Muslim mosques.\nEducation.\nThe city has a campus of the:\nCotonou is a home to African University Institute Foundation (AUi Foundation) one of the biggest educational philanthropic foundations in Africa.\nIt also hosts some of the most prestigious private universities in Africa which includes:\nMedia.\nThe Office de Radiodiffusion et T\u00e9l\u00e9vision du B\u00e9nin (ORTB) \u2014 the national television and radio operator \u2014 is based in Cotonou.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is an oxoacid of chlorine. Usually found as an aqueous solution, this colorless compound is a stronger acid than sulfuric acid, nitric acid and hydrochloric acid. It is a powerful oxidizer when hot, but aqueous solutions up to approximately 70% by weight at room temperature are generally safe, only showing strong acid features and no oxidizing properties. Perchloric acid is useful for preparing perchlorate salts, especially ammonium perchlorate, an important rocket fuel component. Perchloric acid is dangerously corrosive and readily forms potentially explosive mixtures.\nHistory.\nPerchloric acid was first synthesized (together with potassium perchlorate) by Austrian chemist Friedrich von Stadion and called \"oxygenated chloric acid\" in the mid-1810s. French pharmacist Georges-Simon Serullas introduced the modern designation along with discovering its solid monohydrate, which he mistook for an anhydride. Berzelius produced dilute perchloric acid by electrolysis of chloric acid. In the late 1800s, German and Swedish workers commercialized the electrolysis.\nProduction.\nAqueous perchloric acid is produced industrially by two routes. The traditional method exploits the high aqueous solubility of sodium perchlorate (209 g/100 ml of water at room temperature). Treatment of such solutions with hydrochloric acid gives perchloric acid, precipitating solid sodium chloride:\nNaClO4 + HCl \u2192 NaCl + HClO4\nThe concentrated acid can be purified by distillation. The alternative route, which is more direct and avoids salts, entails anodic oxidation of aqueous chlorine at a platinum electrode.\nIn the laboratory for small-scale syntheses, it can be distilled from a solution of potassium perchlorate in sulfuric acid. It can also be synthesized by the treatment of barium perchlorate with sulfuric acid precipitating barium sulfate, leaving perchloric acid. It can also be made by mixing nitric acid with ammonium perchlorate and boiling while adding hydrochloric acid. The reaction gives nitrous oxide and perchloric acid due to a concurrent reaction involving the ammonium ion, and can be concentrated and purified significantly by boiling off the remaining nitric and hydrochloric acids.\nAnhydrous perchloric acid is synthesized by the vacuum distillation of a mixture of azeotropic aqueous perchloric acid and oleum (fuming sulfuric acid).\nProperties.\nAnhydrous perchloric acid is an unstable oily liquid at room temperature. It forms at least five hydrates, several of which have been characterized crystallographically. These solids consist of the perchlorate anion linked via hydrogen bonds to H2O and H3O+ centers. An example is hydronium perchlorate. Perchloric acid forms an azeotrope with water, consisting of about 72.5% perchloric acid. This form of the acid is stable indefinitely and is commercially available. Such solutions are hygroscopic. Thus, if left open to the air, concentrated perchloric acid dilutes itself by absorbing water from the air.\nDehydration of perchloric acid gives the anhydride dichlorine heptoxide:\n2 HClO4 + P4O10 \u2192 Cl2O7 + H2P4O11\nUses.\nPerchloric acid is mainly produced as a precursor to ammonium perchlorate, which is used in rocket propellant. The growth in rocketry has led to increased production of perchloric acid. Several million kilograms are produced annually. Perchloric acid is one of the most proven materials for etching of liquid crystal displays and critical electronics applications as well as ore extraction and has unique properties in analytical chemistry. Additionally it is a useful component in etching of chrome.\nAs an acid.\nPerchloric acid, a superacid, is one of the strongest Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acids. That its p\"K\"a is lower than \u22129 is evidenced by the fact that its monohydrate contains discrete hydronium ions and can be isolated as a stable, crystalline solid, formulated as [H3O+][ClO4\u2013]. The most recent estimate of its aqueous p\"K\"a is . It provides strong acidity with minimal interference because perchlorate is weakly nucleophilic (explaining the high acidity of HClO4). Other acids of noncoordinating anions, such as fluoroboric acid and hexafluorophosphoric acid are susceptible to hydrolysis, whereas perchloric acid is not. Despite hazards associated with the explosiveness of its salts, the acid is often preferred in certain syntheses. For similar reasons, it is a useful eluent in ion-exchange chromatography. It is also used in electropolishing or the etching of aluminium, molybdenum, and other metals.\nIn geochemistry, perchloric acid aids in the digestion of silicate mineral samples for analysis, and also for complete digestion of organic matter.\nSafety.\nGiven its strong oxidizing properties, perchloric acid is subject to extensive regulations because it can react violently with metals and flammable substances such as wood, plastics, and oils. Work conducted with perchloric acid must be conducted in fume hoods with a wash-down capability to prevent accumulation of oxidisers in the ductwork.\nOn February 20, 1947 in Los Angeles, California, 17 people were killed and 150 injured in the O'Connor Plating Works disaster. A bath, consisting of over 1000 litres of 75% perchloric acid and 25% acetic anhydride by volume which was being used to electro-polish aluminium furniture, exploded. Organic compounds were added to the overheating bath when an iron rack was replaced with one coated with cellulose acetobutyrate (Tenit-2 plastic). A few minutes later the bath exploded. The O'Connor Electro-Plating plant, 25 other buildings, and 40 automobiles were destroyed, and 250 nearby homes were damaged.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With an estimated population of 36.6 million, Dhaka is the second largest city by population in the world, and is widely considered to be the most densely populated built-up urban area in the world. Dhaka is an important cultural, economic, and scientific hub of Eastern South Asia. Dhaka ranks fourth in South Asia and 55th in the world in terms of GDP. Lying on the Ganges Delta, it is bounded by the Buriganga, Turag, Dhaleshwari and Shitalakshya rivers. It is also the largest Bengali-speaking city in the world.\nThe area of Dhaka has been inhabited since the first millennium. An early modern city developed from the 17th century as a provincial capital and commercial centre of the Mughal Empire. Dhaka was the capital of a proto-industrialized Mughal Bengal for 75 years (1608\u201339 and 1660\u20131704). It was the hub of the muslin trade in Bengal and one of the most prosperous cities in the world. The Mughal city was named Jahangirnagar (\"The City of Jahangir\") in honour of the erstwhile ruling emperor Jahangir. The city's wealthy Mughal elite included princes and the sons of Mughal emperors. The pre-colonial city's glory peaked in the 17th and 18th centuries, when it was home to merchants from across Eurasia. The Port of Dhaka was a major trading hub for both riverine and maritime commerce. The Mughals decorated the city with well-laid gardens, tombs, mosques, palaces, and forts. The city was once called the \"Venice of the East\".\nUnder British rule, the city saw the introduction of electricity, railways, cinemas, Western-style universities and colleges, and a modern water supply. It became an important administrative and educational centre in the British Raj, as the capital of Eastern Bengal and Assam province after 1905. In 1947, after the end of British rule, the city became the administrative capital of East Pakistan. It was declared the legislative capital of Pakistan in 1962. In 1971, following the Liberation War, it became the capital of an independent Bangladesh. In 2008, Dhaka celebrated 400 years as a municipal city.\nA gamma+ global city, Dhaka is the centre of political, economic and cultural life in Bangladesh. It is the seat of the Government of Bangladesh, many Bangladeshi companies, and leading Bangladeshi educational, scientific, research, and cultural organizations. Since its establishment as a modern capital city, the population, area, and social and economic diversity of Dhaka have grown tremendously. The city is now one of the most densely industrialized regions in the country. The city accounts for 35% of Bangladesh's economy. The Dhaka Stock Exchange has over 750 listed companies. Dhaka hosts over 50 diplomatic missions, as well as the headquarters of BIMSTEC, CIRDAP, and the International Jute Study Group. Dhaka has a renowned culinary heritage. The city's culture is known for its rickshaws, Kacchi Biryani, art festivals, street food, and religious diversity. While it has a heritage of 2000 buildings from the Mughal and British periods, Dhaka's most prominent architectural landmark is the modernist Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban. The city is associated with two Nobel laureates. Dhaka's annual Bengali New Year parade, its Jamdani sari, and its rickshaw art have been recognized by UNESCO as the intangible cultural heritage of humanity. The city has produced many writers and poets in several languages, especially in Bengali and English.\nEtymology.\nThe origins of the name Dhaka are uncertain. It may derive from the \"dhak\" tree, which was once common in the area, or from Dhakeshwari, the 'patron Hindu goddess' of the region. Another popular theory states that Dhaka refers to a membranophone instrument, \"dhak,\" which was played by order of Subahdar Islam Khan I during the inauguration of the Bengal capital in 1610.\nSome references also say it was derived from a Prakrit dialect called Dhaka Bhasa; or Dhakkaiyya, used in the Rajtarangini, meaning a watch station; or it is the same as Davaka, mentioned in the Allahabad pillar inscription of Samudragupta as an eastern frontier kingdom. According to Rajatarangini, written by a Kashmiri Brahman, Kalhana, the region was originally known as \"Dhakka\". The word \"Dhakka\" means \"watchtower\". Bikrampur and Sonargaon\u2014the earlier strongholds of Bengal rulers\u2014were situated nearby. So, Dhaka was possibly used as the watchtower for fortification purpose.\nHistory.\nPre-Mughal.\nThe history of urban settlements in the area of modern-day Dhaka dates to the first millennium. The region was part of the ancient district of Bikrampur, which was ruled by the Sena dynasty. Under Islamic rule, it became part of the historic district of Sonargaon, the regional administrative hub of the Delhi and the Bengal Sultanates. The Grand Trunk Road passed through the region, connecting it with North India, Central Asia and the south-eastern port city of Chittagong. Before Dhaka, the capital of Bengal was Gour. Even earlier capitals included Pandua, Bikrampur and Sonargaon. The latter was also the seat of Isa Khan and his son Musa Khan, who both headed a confederation of twelve chieftains that resisted Mughal expansion in eastern Bengal during the late 16th century. Due to a change in the course of the Ganges, the strategic importance of Gour was lost. Dhaka was viewed with strategic importance due to the Mughal need to consolidate control in eastern Bengal. The Mughals also planned to extend their empire beyond into Assam and Arakan. Dhaka and Chittagong became the eastern frontiers of the Mughal Empire.\nEarly period of Mughal Bengal.\nDhaka became the capital of the Mughal province of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa in 1610 with a jurisdiction covering modern-day Bangladesh and eastern India, including the modern-day Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. This province was known as Bengal Subah. The city was founded during the reign of Emperor Jahangir. Emperor Shah Jahan visited Dhaka in 1624 and stayed in the city for a week, four years before he became emperor in 1628. Dhaka became one of the richest and greatest cities in the world during the early period of Bengal Subah (1610\u20131717). The prosperity of Dhaka reached its peak during the administration of governor Shaista Khan (1644\u20131677 and 1680\u20131688). Rice was then sold at eight maunds per rupee. Thomas Bowrey, an English merchant sailor who visited the city between 1669 and 1670, wrote that the city was 40 miles in circuit. He estimated the city to be more populated than London with 900,000 people.\nBengal became the economic engine of the Mughal Empire. Dhaka played a key role in the proto-industrialization of Bengal. It was the centre of the muslin trade in Bengal, leading to muslin being called \"Daka\" in distant markets as far away as Central Asia. Mughal India depended on Bengali products like rice, silk and cotton textiles. European East India Companies from Britain, Holland, France, and Denmark also depended on Bengali products. Bengal accounted for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia, with many products being sold to Dutch ships in Bengali harbours and then transported to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. Bengal accounted for 50% of textiles and 80% of silks in Dutch textile imports from Asia. Silk was also exported to premodern Japan. The region had a large shipbuilding industry which supplied the Mughal Navy. The shipbuilding output of Bengal during the 16th and 17th centuries stood at 223,250 tons annually, compared to 23,061 tons produced by North America from 1769 to 1771. The Mughals decorated the city with well-laid-out gardens. Caravanserai included the Bara Katra and Choto Katra. The architect of the palatial Bara Katra was Abul Qashim Al Hussaini Attabatayi Assemani. According to inscriptions in the Bangladesh National Museum, the ownership of Bara Katra was entrusted to an Islamic \"waqf\". The Bara Katra also served as a residence for Mughal governors, including Prince Shah Shuja (the son of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan). Dhaka was home to an array of Mughal bureaucrats and military officials, as well as members of the imperial family. The city was guarded by Mughal artillery like the Bibi Mariam Cannon (Lady Mary Cannon).\nIslam Khan I was the first Mughal governor to reside in the city. Khan named it \"Jahangirnagar\" (\"The City of Jahangir\") in honour of the Emperor Jahangir. The name was dropped soon after the English conquered. The main expansion of the city took place under Governor Shaista Khan. The city then measured , with a population of nearly one million. Dhaka became home to one of the richest elites in Mughal India.\nThe construction of Lalbagh Fort was commenced in 1678 by Prince Azam Shah, who was the governor of Bengal, a son of Emperor Aurangzeb and a future Mughal Emperor himself. The Lalbagh Fort was intended to be the viceregal residence of Mughal governors in eastern India. Before the fort's construction could be completed, the prince was recalled by Emperor Aurangzeb. The fort's construction was halted by Shaista Khan after the death of his daughter Pari Bibi, who is buried in a tomb in the centre of the unfinished fort. Pari Bibi, whose name means \"Fairy Lady\", was legendary for her beauty, engaged to Prince Azam Shah, and a potential future Mughal empress before her premature death. Internal conflict in the Mughal court cut short Dhaka's growth as an imperial city. Prince Azam Shah's rivalry with Murshid Quli Khan resulted in Dhaka losing its status as the provincial capital. In 1717, the provincial capital was shifted to Murshidabad where Murshid Quli Khan declared himself as the Nawab of Bengal.\nNaib Nizamat.\nUnder the Nawabs of Bengal, the Naib Nazim of Dhaka was in charge of the city. The Naib Nazim was the deputy governor of Bengal. He also dealt with the upkeep of the Mughal Navy. The Naib Nazim was in charge of the Dhaka Division, which included Dhaka, Comilla, and Chittagong. Dhaka Division was one of the four divisions under the Nawabs of Bengal. The Nawabs of Bengal allowed European trading companies to establish factories across Bengal. The region then became a hotbed for European rivalries. The British moved to oust the last independent Nawab of Bengal in 1757, who was allied with the French. Due to the defection of Nawab's army chief Mir Jafar to the British side, the last Nawab lost the Battle of Plassey.\nAfter the Battle of Buxar in 1765, the Treaty of Allahabad allowed the British East India Company to become the tax collector in Bengal on behalf of the Mughal Emperor in Delhi. The Naib Nazim continued to function until 1793 when all his powers were transferred to the East India Company. The city formally passed to the control of the East India Company in 1793. British military raids damaged a lot of the city's infrastructure. The military conflict caused a sharp decline in the urban population. Dhaka's fortunes received a boost with connections to the mercantile networks of the British Empire. With the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, Dhaka became a leading centre of the jute trade, as Bengal accounted for the largest share of the world's jute production.\nBut the British neglected Dhaka's industrial and urban development until the late 19th century. Income from the pre-colonial, proto-industrialized textile industry dried up. Bengali weavers went out of business after the imposition of a 75% tax on the export of cotton from Bengal, as well as the surge in imports of cheap, British-manufactured fabrics after the advent of the spinning mule and steam power. The rapid growth of the colonial capital Calcutta contributed to the decline in Dhaka's population and economy in the early 1800s. In 1824, an Anglican bishop described Dhaka as a \"City of magnificent ruins\". Evan so, it still had an estimated 90,000 houses and huts and a population of around 300,000 by the 1840s.\nTrade and migration.\nDhaka hosted factories of the English East India Company, the Dutch East India Company, and French East India Company. The property of the Ahsan Manzil was initially bought by the French for their factory and later sold to the Dhaka Nawab Family. The Portuguese were reportedly responsible for introducing cheese. Dhaka saw an influx of migrants during the Mughal Empire. An Armenian community from the Safavid Empire settled in Dhaka and was involved in the city's textile trade, paying a 3.5% tax. The Armenians were very active in the city's social life. They opened the Pogose School. Marwaris were the Hindu trading community. Dhaka also became home to Jews and Greeks. The city has a Greek memorial. Several families of Dhaka's elite spoke Urdu and included Urdu poets. Persians also settled in the city to serve as administrators and military commanders of the Mughal government in Bengal. The legacy of cosmopolitan trading communities lives on in the names of neighbourhoods in Old Dhaka, including Farashganj (French Bazaar), Armanitola (Armenian Quarter) and Postogola (Portuguese Quarter).\nAccording to those who lived in the historic city, \"Dhaka was a courtly, genteel town \u2013 the very last flowering, in their telling, of Mughal etiquette and sensibility. It is this history that is today still reflected in the faded grandeur of the old city, now crumbling due to decades of neglect. The narrow, winding, high-walled lanes and alleyways, the old high-ceilinged houses with verandas and balconies, the old neighbourhoods, the graveyards and gardens, the mosques, the grand old mansions \u2013 these are all still there if one goes looking\". Railway stations, postal departments, civil service posts and river port stations were often staffed by Anglo-Indians.\nThe city's hinterland supplied rice, jute, gunny sacks, turmeric, ginger, leather hides, silk, rugs, saltpeter, salt, sugar, indigo, cotton, and iron. British opium policy in Bengal contributed to the Opium Wars with China. American traders collected artwork, handicrafts, terracotta, sculptures, religious and literary texts, manuscripts, and military weapons from Bengal. Some objects from the region are on display in the Peabody Essex Museum. The increase in international trade led to profits for many families in the city, allowing them to buy imported luxury goods.\nBritish Raj.\nDuring the Indian mutiny of 1857, the city witnessed revolts by the Bengal Army. Direct rule by the British crown was established following the successful quelling of the mutiny. It bestowed privileges on the Dhaka Nawab Family, which dominated the city's political and social elite. The Dhaka Cantonment was established as a base for the British Indian Army. The British developed the modern city around Ramna, Shahbag Garden, and Victoria Park. Dhaka got its own version of the hansom cab as public transport in 1856. The number of carriages increased from 60 in 1867 to 600 in 1889.\nA modern civic water system was introduced in 1874. In 1885, the Dhaka State Railway was opened with a 144\u00a0km metre gauge (1000\u00a0mm) rail line connecting Mymensingh and the Port of Narayanganj through Dhaka. The city later became a hub of the Eastern Bengal State Railway. The first film shown in Dhaka was screened on the Riverfront Crown Theatre on 17 April 1898. The film show was organized by the Bedford Bioscope Company. The electricity supply began in 1901.\nThis period is described as being \"the colonial-era part of Dhaka, developed by the British during the early 20th century. Similar to colonial boroughs the length and breadth of the Subcontinent, this development was typified by stately government buildings, spacious tree-lined avenues, and sturdy white-washed bungalows set amidst always overgrown (the British never did manage to fully tame the landscape) gardens. Once upon a time, this was the new city; and even though it is today far from the ritziest part of town, the streets here are still wider and the trees more abundant and the greenery more evident than in any other part\".\nSome of the early educational institutions established during the period of British rule include the Dhaka College, the Dhaka Medical School, the Eden College, St. Gregory's School, the Mohsinia Madrasa, Jagannath College and the Ahsanullah School of Engineering. Horse racing was a favourite pastime for elite residents in the city's Ramna Race Course beside the Dhaka Club. The Viceroy of India would often dine and entertain with Bengali aristocrats in the city. Automobiles began appearing after the turn of the century. A 1937 Sunbeam-Talbot Ten was preserved in the Liberation War Museum. The Nawabs of Dhaka owned Rolls-Royces. Austin cars were widely used. Beauty Boarding was a popular inn and restaurant.\nDhaka's fortunes changed in the early 20th century. British neglect of Dhaka's urban development was overturned with the first partition of Bengal in 1905, which restored Dhaka's status as a regional capital. The city became the seat of government for Eastern Bengal and Assam, with a jurisdiction covering most of modern-day Bangladesh and all of what is now Northeast India. The partition was the brainchild of Lord Curzon, who finally acted on British ideas for partitioning Bengal to improve administration, education, and business. Dhaka became the seat of the Eastern Bengal and Assam Legislative Council. While Dhaka was the main capital throughout the year, Shillong acted as the summer retreat of the administration. Lieutenant Governors were in charge of the province. They resided in Dhaka. The Lt Governors included Sir Bampfylde Fuller (1905\u20131906), Sir Lancelot Hare (1906\u20131911), and Sir Charles Stuart Bayley (1911\u20131912). Their legacy lives on in the names of three major thoroughfares in modern Dhaka, including Hare Road, Bayley Road, and Fuller Road. The period saw the construction of stately buildings, including the High Court and Curzon Hall. The city was home to diverse groups of people, including Armenians, Jews, Anglo-Indians and Hindus. The Hindus included both Marwaris and Bengali Hindus, with a plurality emerging by 1941 and engaged in professions like teaching, medicine, law, and business.\nDhaka was the seat of government for 4 administrative divisions, including the Assam Valley Division, Chittagong Division, Dacca Division, Rajshahi Division, and the Surma Valley Division. There were a total of 30 districts in Eastern Bengal and Assam, including Dacca, Mymensingh, Faridpur and Backergunge in Dacca Division; Tippera, Noakhali, Chittagong and the Hill Tracts in Chittagong Division; Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Rangpur, Bogra, Pabna and Malda in Rajshahi Division; Sylhet, Cachar, the Khasi and Jaintia Hills, the Naga Hills and the Lushai Hills in Surma Valley Division; and Goalpara, Kamrup, the Garo Hills, Darrang, Nowgong, Sibsagar and Lakhimpur in Assam Valley Division. The province was bordered by Cooch Behar State, Hill Tipperah and the Kingdom of Bhutan.\nOn the political front, partition allowed Dhaka to project itself as the standard-bearer of Muslim communities in British India, as opposed to the heavily Hindu-dominated city of Calcutta. In 1906, the All India Muslim League was founded in the city during a conference on liberal education hosted by the Nawab of Dhaka and the Aga Khan III. The Muslim population in Dhaka and eastern Bengal generally favoured partition in the hopes of getting better jobs and educational opportunities. Many Bengalis, however, opposed the bifurcation of the ethnolinguistic region. The partition was annulled by an announcement from King George V during the Delhi Durbar in 1911. The British decided to reunite Bengal while the capital of India was shifted to New Delhi from Calcutta.\nAs a \"splendid compensation\" for the annulment of partition, the British gave the city a newly formed university in the 1920s. The University of Dhaka was initially modelled on the residential style of the University of Oxford. It became known as the Oxford of the East because of its residential character. Like Oxford, students in Dhaka were affiliated with their halls of residence instead of their academic departments (this system was dropped after 1947 and students are now affiliated with academic departments). The university's faculty included scientist Satyendra Nath Bose (who is the namesake of the Higgs boson); linguist Muhammad Shahidullah, Sir A F Rahman (the first Bengali vice-chancellor of the university); and historian R. C. Majumdar. The university was established in 1921 by the Imperial Legislative Council. It started with three faculties and 12 departments, covering the subjects of Sanskrit, Bengali, English, liberal arts, history, Arabic, Islamic Studies, Persian, Urdu, philosophy, economics, politics, physics, chemistry, mathematics, and law.\nThe East Bengal Cinematograph Company produced the first full-length silent movies in Dhaka during the 1920s, including \"Sukumari\" and \"The Last Kiss\". DEVCO, a subsidiary of the Occtavian Steel Company, began widescale power distribution in 1930. The Tejgaon Airport was constructed during World War II as a base for Allied Forces. The Dhaka Medical College was established in 1946.\nAt the time of the partition of India, many rich Hindu families relocated to West Bengal. Their properties were seized by the state under laws that eventually became known as the Vested Property Act.\nMetropolitan Dhaka.\nThe development of the \"real city\" began after the partition of India. After partition, Dhaka became known as the \"second capital\" of Pakistan. This was formalized in 1962 when Ayub Khan declared the city as the legislative capital under the 1962 constitution. New neighbourhoods began to spring up in formerly barren and agrarian areas. These included Dhanmondi (rice granary), Katabon (thorn forest), Kathalbagan (jackfruit garden), Kalabagan (banana garden), Segunbagicha (teak garden) and Gulshan (flower garden). Living standards rapidly improved from the pre-partition standards. The economy began to industrialize. On the outskirts of the city, the world's largest jute mill was built. The mill produced jute goods which were in high demand during the Korean War. People began building duplex houses. In 1961, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip witnessed the improved living standards of Dhaka's residents. The Intercontinental hotel, designed by William B. Tabler, was opened in 1966. Estonian-American architect Louis I. Kahn was enlisted to design the Dhaka Assembly, which was originally intended to be the federal parliament of Pakistan and later became independent Bangladesh's parliament. The East Pakistan Helicopter Service connected the city to regional towns.\nThe Dhaka Stock Exchange was opened on 28 April 1954. The first local airline Orient Airways began flights between Dhaka and Karachi on 6 June 1954. The Dhaka Improvement Trust was established in 1956 to coordinate the city's development. The first master plan for the city was drawn up in 1959. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization established a medical research centre (now called ICDDR,B) in the city in 1960.\nThe early period of political turbulence was seen between 1947 and 1952, particularly the Bengali language movement. From the mid-1960s, the Awami League's 6-point autonomy demands began giving rise to pro-independence aspirations across East Pakistan. In 1969, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was released from prison amid a mass upsurge which led to the resignation of Ayub Khan in 1970. The city had an influential press with prominent newspapers like the \"Pakistan Observer\", \"Ittefaq,\" \"Forum\", and the \"Weekly Holiday\". During the political and constitutional crisis in 1971, the military junta led by Yahya Khan refused to transfer power to the newly elected National Assembly, causing mass riots, civil disobedience, and a movement for self-determination. On 7 March 1971, Awami League leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman addressed a massive public gathering at the Ramna Race Course Maidan in Dhaka, in which he warned of an independence struggle. Subsequently, East Pakistan came under a non-co-operation movement against the Pakistani state. On Pakistan's Republic Day (23 March 1971), Bangladeshi flags were hoisted throughout Dhaka in a show of resistance.\nOn 25 March 1971, the Pakistan Army launched military operations under Operation Searchlight against the population of East Pakistan. Dhaka bore the brunt of the army's atrocities, witnessing a genocide and a campaign of wide-scale repression, with the arrest, torture, and murder of the city's civilians, students, intelligentsia, political activists and religious minorities. The army faced mutinies from the East Pakistan Rifles and the Bengali police. Large parts of the city were burnt and destroyed, including Hindu neighbourhoods. Much of the city's population was either displaced or forced to flee to the countryside. Dhaka was struck with numerous air raids by the Indian Air Force in December. The Pakistan Eastern Command surrendered to Lt. Gen. Jagjit Singh Aurora at the Ramna Race Course in Dhaka on 16 December 1971.\nAfter independence, Dhaka's population grew from several hundred thousand to several million in five decades. Dhaka was declared the national capital by the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh in 1972. The post-independence period witnessed rapid growth as Dhaka attracted migrant workers from across rural Bangladesh. 60% of population growth has been due to rural migration. The city endured socialist unrest in the early 1970s, followed by a few years of martial law. The stock exchange and free market were restored in the late 1970s. In the 1980s, Dhaka saw the inauguration of the National Parliament House (which won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture), a new international airport and the Bangladesh National Museum. Bangladesh pioneered the formation of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and hosted its first summit in Dhaka in 1985. A mass uprising in 1990 led to the return of parliamentary democracy. Dhaka hosted a trilateral summit between India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh in 1998; the summit of the D-8 Organization for Economic Cooperation in 1999 and conferences of the Commonwealth, SAARC, the OIC and United Nations agencies during various years.\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, Dhaka experienced improved economic growth and the emergence of affluent business districts and satellite towns. Between 1990 and 2005, the city's population doubled from 6\u00a0million to 12\u00a0million. There has been increased foreign investment in the city, particularly in the financial and textile manufacturing sectors. Between 2008 and 2011, the government of Bangladesh organized three years of celebrations to mark 400 years since Dhaka's founding as an early modern city. But frequent hartals by political parties have greatly hampered the city's economy. The hartal rate has declined since 2014. In some years, the city experienced a widespread flash flood during the monsoon.\nDhaka is one of the fastest-growing megacities in the world. It is predicted to be one of the world's largest cities by 2025, along with Tokyo, Mexico City, Shanghai, Beijing and New York City. Most of its population are rural migrants, including climate refugees. Congestion is one of the most prominent features of modern Dhaka. In 2014, it was reported that only 7% of the city was covered by roads. The first phase of Dhaka Metro Rail from Uttara to Agargaon was inaugurated by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on 28 December 2022. However, nearly one third of Dhaka's population lives in slums, as of 2016. The city's main river, the Buriganga River, has become one of the most polluted rivers in the country.\nGeography.\nTopography.\nDhaka is located in central Bangladesh at , on the eastern banks of the Buriganga River. The city lies on the lower reaches of the Ganges Delta and covers a total area of . Tropical vegetation and moist soils characterize the land, which is flat and close to sea level. This leaves Dhaka susceptible to flooding during the monsoon seasons owing to heavy rainfall and cyclones. Due to its location on the lowland plain of the Ganges Delta, the city is fringed by extensive mangroves and tidal flat ecosystems. Dhaka District is bounded by the districts of Gazipur, Tangail, Munshiganj, Rajbari, Narayanganj, and Manikganj.\nThe city of Dhaka is built over a network of rivers. The city\u2019s life is strongly intertwined with the rivers, as they are used for multiple purposes, including transportation.\nCityscape.\nExcept Old Dhaka, which is an old bazaar-style neighbourhood, the layout of the city follows a grid pattern with organic development influenced by traditional South Asian as well as Middle Eastern and Western patterns. Growth of the city is largely unplanned and is focused on the northern regions and around the city centre, where many of the more affluent neighbourhoods may be found. Most of the construction in the city consists of concrete high-rise buildings. Middle-class and upper-class housing, along with commercial and industrial areas, occupy most of the city. However, nearly one third of Dhaka's population lives in slums, as of 2016 (see below).\nDhaka does not have a well-defined central business district. Old Dhaka is the historic commercial centre, but most development has moved to the north. In 1985, the area around Motijheel was considered the \"modern\" CBD, while by 2005 Gulshan was considered the \"newest\" part of the CBD. Many Bangladeshi government institutions can be found in Motijheel, Segunbagicha, Tejgaon, Karwan Bazar, and Sher-e-Bangla Nagar.\nMuch activity is centred around a few large roads, where road laws are rarely obeyed and street vendors and beggars are frequently encountered.\nFor much of recent history, Dhaka was characterized by roadside markets and small shops that sold a wide variety of goods. Recent years have seen the widespread construction of shopping malls. Two of the largest shopping malls in the city and the wider South Asian region are the Jamuna Future Park and Bashundhara City.\nClimate.\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Dhaka has a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Aw\"). The city has a distinct monsoonal season, with an annual average temperature of and monthly means varying between in January and in May. Approximately 87% of the average annual rainfall of occurs between May and October.\nAccording to the World Air Quality Report 2024, Dhaka is one of the world's 20 most polluted cities.\nParks and greenery.\nThere are many parks within Dhaka City, including Ramna Park, Suhrawardy Udyan, Shishu Park, National Botanical Garden, Baldha Garden, Chandrima Uddan, Gulshan Park and Dhaka Zoo.\nRivers and lakes.\nAlmost 10% of the city's area consists of water, with 676 ponds and 43 canals. The Buriganga River flows past the southwest outskirts of Dhaka. Its average depth is and its maximum depth is . It ranks among the most polluted rivers in the country.\nThe city is surrounded by six interconnected river systems\u2014the Buriganga and Dhaleshwari in the southwest, Turag and Tongi Khal in the north, and Balu and Shitalakshya in the east\u2014which support trade, transport, and stormwater drainage. However, the current quality of the river network is very poor, due to the discharge of untreated wastewater from households and industries.\nThere are several lakes within the city, such as Crescent Lake, Dhanmondi Lake, Baridhara-Gulshan Lake, Banani Lake, Uttara Lake, Hatirjheel-Begunbari Lake, and Ramna Lake.\nEnvironmental pollution.\nIncreasing air and water pollution affects public health and quality of life in the city. The air pollution is caused for example by vehicle traffic and congestion. Also, due to the unregulated manufacturing of bricks and other causes, Dhaka has very high levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution.\nWater pollution is caused by the discharge of municipal wastewater from households and industry without treatment. As of 2011 only 20% of the city is connected to a sewer system, whereas 80% is not connected. As a result, the rivers in Dhaka have severe pathogen pollution, as indicated by the fecal coliform count that is several hundred times higher than the recommended national and international standards of less than 200 cfu per litre for bathing and swimming. Chemical surveys in the rivers near Dhaka show extremely high organic pollution loading, high ammonia, and very low dissolved oxygen levels, which are close to zero in the dry season.\nIn addition to the organic and pathogen pollution load from the 1.2 million m3 of untreated sewage, the rivers receive about 60,000 m3 of industrial effluent every day from nine major industrial clusters (as of 2021). There are an estimated 500\u2013700 wet processing and dyeing textile factories releasing a range of chemicals including salts, dyes and bleaches, and 155 tanneries discharging heavy metals, including chromium.\nFour of the rivers surrounding Dhaka\u2014Buriganaga, Sitalakhya, Balu and Turag\u2014are so polluted that they have been declared as \"ecologically critical areas\" in 2009 by the Department of Environment. This makes them unsuitable for any human use. Nevertheless, people living in low-income and slum areas still have a lot of direct contact with river water, exposing them to health risks. They use river water for dish washing, laundry, cleaning fish and vegetables, and personal washing, washing and dyeing denim, washing fish baskets or plastic sheets, collecting plastic waste and fishing. As a result, many of the immediate environmental burdens of river pollution are borne by these low-income residents.\nBodies of water and wetlands around Dhaka face destruction as they are being filled to construct multi-storied buildings and other real estate developments. Coupled with pollution, such erosion of natural habitats threatens to destroy much of the regional biodiversity.\nGovernment.\nCapital city.\nAs the capital of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, Dhaka is home to numerous state and diplomatic institutions. The Bangabhaban is the official residence and workplace of the President of Bangladesh, who is the ceremonial head of state under the constitution. The National Parliament House is located in the modernist capital complex designed by Louis Kahn in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, while the Ganabhaban, known for being former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's official residence, is situated on the north side. The Prime Minister's Office is located in Tejgaon. Most ministries of the Government of Bangladesh are housed in the Bangladesh Secretariat. The Supreme Court, the Dhaka High Court and the Foreign Ministry are located in the Segunbagicha-Shahbagh area. The Defence Ministry and the Ministry of Planning are located in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. The Armed Forces Division of the government of Bangladesh and the army, navy and air force HQs of the Bangladesh Armed Forces are located in Dhaka Cantonment. Several important installations of the Bangladesh Army are also situated in Dhaka and Mirpur Cantonments. The Bangladesh Navy's principal administrative and logistics base, BNS Haji Mohshin, is located in Dhaka. The Bangladesh Air Force maintains the BAF Bangabandhu Air Base and BAF Khademul Bashar Air Base in Dhaka.\nDhaka hosts 54 resident embassies and high commissions and numerous international organizations. Most diplomatic missions are located in the Gulshan and Baridhara areas of the city. The Agargaon area near Parliament is home to the country offices of the United Nations, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank.\nCivic administration.\nHistory.\nThe municipality of Dhaka was founded on 1 August 1864 and upgraded to \"Metropolitan\" status in 1978. In 1983, the Dhaka City Corporation was created as a self-governing entity to govern Dhaka.\nUnder a new act in 1993, an election was held in 1994 for the first elected Mayor of Dhaka. The Dhaka City Corporation ran the affairs of the city until November 2011.\nMunicipal government.\nIn 2011, Dhaka City Corporation was split into two separate corporations \u2013 Dhaka North City Corporation and Dhaka South City Corporation to ensure better civic facilities. These two corporations are headed by two mayors, who are elected by direct vote of the citizen for 5 years. The area within city corporations was divided into several wards, each having an elected commissioner. In total, the city has 130 wards and 725 \"mohallas\".\nAdministrative agencies.\nUnlike other megacities worldwide, Dhaka is serviced by over two dozen government organizations under different ministries. Lack of coordination among them and centralization of all powers by the Government of Bangladesh keeps the development and maintenance of the city in a chaotic situation.\nEconomy.\nAs the most densely industrialized region of the country, the Greater Dhaka Area accounts for 35% of Bangladesh's economy. The Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranks Dhaka as a gamma+ global city, in other words, one that is instrumental in linking their region into the world economy. Major industrial areas are Tejgaon, Shyampur and Hazaribagh. The city has a growing middle class, driving the market for modern consumer and luxury goods. Shopping malls serve as vital elements in the city's economy. The city has historically attracted numerous migrant workers. Hawkers, peddlers, small shops, rickshaw transport, roadside vendors and stalls employ a large segment of the population \u2013 rickshaw drivers alone number as many as 400,000. Half the workforce is employed in household and unorganized labour, while about 800,000 work in the textile industry. The unemployment rate in Dhaka was 23% in 2013.\nAlmost all large local conglomerates have their corporate offices located in Dhaka. Microcredit also began here and the offices of the Nobel Prize-winning Grameen Bank and BRAC (the largest non-governmental development organization in the world) are based in Dhaka. Urban developments have sparked a widespread construction boom; new high-rise buildings and skyscrapers have changed the city's landscape. Growth has been especially strong in the finance, banking, manufacturing, telecommunications, and service sectors, while tourism, hotels, and restaurants continue as important elements of the Dhaka economy.\nDhaka has rising traffic congestion and inadequate infrastructure; the national government has recently implemented a policy for rapid urbanization of surrounding areas and beyond by the introduction of a ten-year relief on income tax for new construction of facilities and buildings outside Dhaka.\nCBDs.\nThe Dhaka metropolitan area boasts several central business districts (CBDs). In the southern part of the city, the riverfront of Old Dhaka is home to many small businesses, factories, and trading companies. Near Old Dhaka lies Motijheel, which is the biggest CBD in Bangladesh. The Motijheel area developed in the 1960s. Motijheel is home to the Bangladesh Bank, the nation's central bank; as well as the headquarters of the largest state-owned banks, including Janata Bank, Pubali Bank, Sonali Bank and Rupali Bank. By the 1990s, the affluent residential neighbourhoods of Gulshan, Banani and Uttara in the northern part of the city became a major business centre and now hosts many international companies operating in Bangladesh. The Purbachal New Town Project is planned as the city's future CBD.\nThe following is a list of the main CBDs in Dhaka.\nTrade associations.\nMajor trade associations based in the city include:\nStock market.\nThe Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) had a market capitalization of BDT 5,136,979.000 million in 2021. Some of the largest companies listed on the DSE include:\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPopulation.\nThe city, in combination with localities forming the wider metropolitan area, is home to over 22\u00a0million people as of 2022[ [update]]. The population is growing by an estimated 3.3% per year, one of the highest rates among Asian cities. The continuing growth reflects ongoing migration from rural areas to the Dhaka urban region, which accounted for 60% of the city's growth in the 1960s and 1970s. More recently, the city's population has also grown with the expansion of city boundaries, a process that added more than a million people to the city in the 1980s. According to the \"Far Eastern Economic Review\", Dhaka will be home to 25\u00a0million people by the end of 2025.\nThis rapid population growth makes it difficult for the city government to provide the necessary infrastructure in a timely manner, e.g. for water supply, electricity and waste management.\nSlums.\nAbout 30% of Dhaka's population lives in slums (or unplanned urban settlements), as of 2016. Estimates from 2011 and 2015 found that there are about \"3 to 5 thousand slums and squatter settlements scattered all over the city\". It is often the new arrivals, people migrating from rural areas, who end up living in slums. People only have very limited access to water, sanitation and other services in those slum areas.\nSlums may be found in the outskirts and in less-visible areas such as alleyways. As of 2021, the largest slum is in Kamrangirchar, where about 600,000 people live in slum conditions.\nEthnicity.\nThe city population is composed of people from virtually every region of Bangladesh. The long-standing inhabitants of the old city are known as Dhakaiya and have a distinctive Bengali dialect and culture. Dhaka is also home to a large number of Bihari refugees, who are descendants of migrant Muslims from eastern India during 1947 and settled down in East Pakistan. The correct population of Biharis living in the city is ambiguous, but it is estimated that there are at least 300,000 Urdu-speakers in all of Bangladesh, mostly residing in old Dhaka and in refugee camps in Dhaka, although official figures estimate only 40,000. Between 15,000 and 20,000 of the Rohingya, Santal, Khasi, Garo, Chakma and Mandi tribal peoples reside in the city.\nLanguage.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMost residents of Dhaka speak Bengali, the national language. Other than Standard Bengali which is used in business and education, most prominent Bengali dialects spoken in the city include an \"Urban East Bengal Colloquial\" dialect,\nand Dhakaiya Kutti spoken in Old Dhaka. English is spoken by a large segment of the population, especially for business purposes. The city has both Bengali and English newspapers. Urdu, including Dhakaiya Urdu, is spoken by members of several non-Bengali communities, including the Biharis.\nLiteracy.\nThe literacy rate in Dhaka is also increasing quickly. It was estimated at 69.2% in 2001. The literacy rate had gone up to 74.6% by 2011 which is significantly higher than the national average of 72%.\nReligion.\nIslam is the dominant religion of the city, with 19.3 million of the city's population being Muslim, and a majority belonging to the Sunni sect. There is also a small Shia sect, and an Ahmadiya community. Hinduism is the second-largest religion numbering around 1.47 million adherents. Smaller segments represent 1% and practise Christianity and Buddhism. In the city proper, over 8.5 million of the 8.9 million residents are Muslims, while 320,000 are Hindu and nearly 50,000 Christian.\nInfrastructure.\nTransport.\nMotorcycles comprised half of Dhaka's registered vehicles in 2023, while car ownership rate is only six per cent. One of the world's least motorized cities, the three-wheeled cycle rickshaw is the most popular and ubiquitous mode of transport, which accounted for 54 per cent of vehicle trips in 2011. Dhaka is among the most congested cities in the world, and traffic was estimated to cost the local economy US$billion per year in 2020. The average speed of a car travelling in the city is less than . Auto rickshaws powered by compressed natural gas, often referred to by locals as \"CNGs\", are also a popular mode of transport.\nRoad.\nThe city is connected to other parts of the country through highway and railway links. Five of Bangladesh's eight major national highways start from the city: N1, N2, N3, N5 and N8. Dhaka is also directly connected to the two longest routes of the Asian Highway Network: AH1 and AH2, as well as to the AH41 route. Highway links to the Indian cities of Kolkata, Agartala, Guwahati and Shillong have been established by the BRTC and private bus companies, which also run regular international bus services to those cities from Dhaka.\nThe Dhaka Elevated Expressway, the first of its kind in the country, improves connectivity between the northern part of the city and the central, southern, and south-eastern parts. An extension, the Dhaka\u2013Ashulia Elevated Expressway, is expected to open in 2026.\nRickshaws.\nCycle rickshaws and CNG auto-rickshaws are the main modes of transport within the metro area, with more than 1.5 million rickshaws running each day: the highest number in any city in the world. However, only around 220 thousand rickshaws are licensed by the city government. Over 15,000 legally registered CNGs serve passengers in Dhaka, with thousands more operating illegally.\nRide sharing.\nSince 2016, Uber and Pathao have dominated the ride-sharing market in Dhaka, which offer both car and motorcycle services. Ride-sharing services have led to a decline in the use of CNG auto-rickshaws, although Uber has expanded its services to include CNG auto-rickshaws in 2021.\nBus.\nBuses carried about 1.9 million passengers per day in 2007. Public buses in Dhaka are primarily operated by numerous private companies, with a minority run by the state-owned Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC). BRTC buses are red, based initially on the Routemaster buses of London. There are three inter-district bus terminals in Dhaka, which are located in the city's Mohakhali, Saidabad, and Gabtoli areas. It is now planned to move three inter-district bus terminals outside the town. Highway links to the Indian cities of Kolkata, Agartala, Guwahati and Shillong have been established by the BRTC and private bus companies, which also run regular international bus services to those cities from Dhaka.\nSet to open in December 2024, the Dhaka Bus Rapid Transit system is expected to reduce travel time from Dhaka to the satellite town of Gazipur from as long as four hours to just 35\u201340 minutes.\nWaterways.\nThe Sadarghat River Port on the banks of the Buriganga River serves for the transport of goods and passengers upriver and to other ports in Bangladesh. Inter-city and inter-district motor vessels and passenger ferry services are used by many people to travel riverine regions of the country from the city. Water bus services are available on the Buriganga River and Hatirjheel and Gulshan lakes, providing connectivity via two routes, Tejgaon\u2013Gulshan and Tejgaon\u2013Rampura.\nRail.\nKamalapur railway station, situated on the northeast side of Motijheel, is the largest and busiest of the city's railway stations. It was designed by American architect Robert Boughey and was completed in 1969. The state-owned Bangladesh Railway provides suburban and national services, with regular express train services connecting Dhaka with other major urban areas, such as Chittagong, Rajshahi, Khulna, Sylhet and Rangpur. The Maitree Express and the Mitali Express provides connections from Dhaka to West Bengal in India.\nDhaka Metro Rail is a mass rapid transit system serving the city. It is a part of the 20-year-long Strategic Transport Plan (STP) outlined by the Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority (DTCA). The first phase of Dhaka Metro's MRT Line 6 was inaugurated by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and commenced commercial operations on 28 December 2022.\nThe metro network is planned to contain six lines. Before the opening of the Dhaka Metro Rail, Dhaka was the biggest city in the world without a mass rapid transit system. Unrelated to the metro, there is also a proposal to build a subway and an orbital railway system.\nAir.\nHazrat Shahjalal International Airport (formerly Zia International Airport), located north of Dhaka city centre, is the largest and busiest international airport in the country. Although built with an annual passenger-handling capacity of 8 million, it handled more than 11 million passengers in 2023. The average aircraft movement per day is around 330 flights. It is the hub of most Bangladeshi airlines. Domestic service flies to Chittagong, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Cox's Bazar, Jessore, Barisal, and Saidpur (Rangpur), and international services fly to major cities in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. The airport's capacity is expected to more than double to 20 million once the modern third terminal opens fully in October 2024. According to the project design, the third terminal will have 12 boarding bridges and 16 conveyor belts. The terminal will have 115 check-in counters and 128 immigration desks.\nWater supply and sanitation.\nWater management in Dhaka faces numerous challenges such as flooding, poor service quality, groundwater depletion, inadequate sanitation, polluted river water, unplanned urban development, and the existence of large slums.\nThe Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Dhaka WASA) is \"responsible for providing drinking water, sewerage, and storm-water drainage services to the city\". The work of Dhaka WASA is funded by the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives.\n87% of the city's growing water demand is sourced from groundwater (as of 2021). This is because the extreme contamination of rivers and lakes makes surface water treatment economically and technologically unfeasible. While around 20% of the daily demand of 2.4 billion litres of water is met with surface water from five treatment plants, the groundwater table is falling at a rate of two to three metres per year.\nThe Bangladesh Urban Informal Settlements Survey 2016 included a representative sample of 588 households across small, medium and large slums in Dhaka. It showed that 68% of the households accessed piped water through a shared connection within the slum compound. The poorest households shared a waterpoint with 43 other households on average compared to 23 sharers among the richest households. In terms of sanitation, only 8% of the slum households had access to a flush toilet connected to a septic tank, while 78% used improved pit latrines and the remaining 10% depended on hanging latrines.\nSewage treatment plants.\nThe sewage system is inadequate, with 70 per cent of the two million cubic metres of sewage produced daily being discharged into rivers, according to wastewater management experts. Due to improper maintenance and the age of the system, the majority of the sewerage network is out of operation. Most buildings handle their own sewage by constructing soak pits or septic tanks, often connected to storm drains. Consequently, 80 per cent of faecal sludge ends up in rivers, according to experts.\nDhaka is served by two sewage treatment plants. The Pagla Sewerage Treatment Plant (PSTP) in Narayanganj District has a capacity of 120 megalitres per day but can only utilise one-third of its capacity, handling just 10 per cent of the city's waste. The Dasherkandi Sewage Treatment Plant, opened in 2023, is South Asia's largest, with a capacity to treat 500 megalitres, or 20\u201325% of the city's 2,000 megalitres of sewage generated daily. However, it is also hampered by a lack of sewage connections.\nAs of 2023, the Bangladesh Government and the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) are implementing an ambitious plan, called \"Dhaka Sewerage Master Plan\", to treat most of the residential and industrial wastewater through the construction of several sewage treatment plants. The Bangladesh Government is planning to install over 12 large new sewage treatment plants over the next 20 years.\nCulture.\nLiterature.\nDhaka is a major centre for Bengali literature. It has been the hub of Bengali Muslim literature for more than a century. Its heritage also includes historic Urdu and Persian literary traditions. \"Dark Diamond\" by Shazia Omar in set in Mughal-era Dhaka during the reign of Shaista Khan, the Mughal viceroy and uncle of Emperor Aurangzeb.\"The Soldier in the Attic\" by Akhteruzzaman Elias is considered to be one of the best depictions of life in Old Dhaka and is set during Bengali uprisings in 1969. \"A Golden Age\" by Tahmima Anam is also set in Dhaka during the Bangladeshi War of Independence and includes references to the Dhaka Club, the Dhaka University and the Dhanmondi area.\nTextiles.\nFor centuries, the region around Dhaka has been the centre of production for fine cotton textiles. Muslin was abundantly produced in the region. The weavers of Dhaka were patronized by the rulers of Bengal and Delhi. They supplied textiles to the Mughal imperial court. The city of Dhaka became one of the most important centres of the cotton textile trade in the 17th century; it was the capital of the Muslin trade in Bengal. Merchants from around the world came to Dhaka to buy its much sought after cotton fabrics. UNESCO has recognized Jamdani muslin as an intangible cultural heritage. According to UNESCO, \"Jamdani is a vividly patterned, sheer cotton fabric, traditionally woven on a handloom by craftspeople and apprentices around Dhaka\". UNESCO believes \"the Jamdani sari is a symbol of identity, dignity and self-recognition and provides wearers with a sense of cultural identity and social cohesion. The weavers develop an occupational identity and take great pride in their heritage; they enjoy social recognition and are highly respected for their skills\".\nFestivals.\nAnnual celebrations for Language Martyrs' Day (21 February), Independence Day (26 March), and Victory Day (16 December) are prominently celebrated across the city. Dhaka's people congregate at the Shaheed Minar and the Jatiyo Smriti Soudho to remember the national heroes of the liberation war. These occasions are observed with public ceremonies and rallies on public grounds. Many schools and colleges organize fairs, festivals, and concerts in which citizens from all levels of society participate.\"Pohela Baishakh\", the Bengali New Year, falls annually on 14 April and is popularly celebrated across the city. Large crowds of people gather on the streets of Shahbag, Ramna Park and the campus of the University of Dhaka for celebrations. \"Pahela Falgun\", the first day of spring of the month Falgun in the Bengali calendar, is also festively celebrated in the city. This day is marked with colourful celebration and traditionally, women wear yellow saris to celebrate this day. This celebration is also known as \"Basanta Utsab\" (Spring Festival). Nabanna is a harvest celebration, usually celebrated with food and dance, and music on the 1st day of the month of Agrahayan of the Bengali year. Birthdays of Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam are observed respectively as Rabindra Jayanti and Nazrul Jayanti. The Ekushey Book Fair, which is arranged each year by Bangla Academy, takes place for the whole month of February. This event is dedicated to the martyrs who died on 21 February 1952 in a demonstration calling for the establishment of Bengali as one of the state languages of former East Pakistan. Shakrain Festival is an annual celebration observed with the flying of kites. It is usually observed in the old part of the city at the end of Poush, the ninth month of the Bengali calendar (14 or 15 January in the Gregorian calendar).\nReligious Festivals.\nThe Islamic festivals of Eid ul-Fitr, Eid ul-Adha, Eid-E-Miladunnabi and Muharram; the Hindu festival of Durga Puja; the Buddhist festival of Buddha Purnima; and the Christian festival of Christmas witness widespread celebrations across the city.\nMusic.\nThe popularity of music groups and rock bands such as Warfaze, Shironamhin, Artcell and other solo artists such as Aryan Chowdhary, Ayub Bachchu, and Shafin Ahmed is growing day by day among the newer generations of Dhaka. Despite this, traditional folk music remains widely popular. The works of the national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam, national anthem writer Rabindranath Tagore and mystic saint songwriter Lalon have a widespread following across Dhaka. Bailey Road is known as \"natak para\" (drama neighbourhood) for its two theatre halls.\nRickshaws.\nRickshaws have become a symbol of the city. Rickshaws are colourfully painted with floral patterns and depictions of birds, animals, movie stars, religious text, historical events and national heroes. According to UNESCO, \"Rickshaws and rickshaw painting are viewed as a key part of the city's cultural tradition and a dynamic form of urban folk art\".\nCuisine.\nHistorically, Dhaka has been the culinary capital of Bengal for Muslim cuisine, particularly Mughlai cuisine. Restaurants in the city serve several types of biryani, including Kacchi Biryani (goat meat), Tehari (beef), Murag Pulao (chicken), and Ilish Pulao (ilish fish). Khichuri rice is a popular comfort food. A distinct variant of Bengali-Mughlai cuisine evolved in the city. Like other Mughal cities, a special tradition exists to eat nihari beef stew during breakfast. In Dhaka, the nihari stew can be eaten with Bengali breads. Chefs from Dhaka, the former Mughal provincial capital, served in the kitchens of the Nawabs of Dhaka and Murshidabad. They invented the \"Kacchi Biryani\", which is a variant of biryani with mutton steaks and potatoes. One of the longest surviving outlets serving authentic \"Kacchi Biryani\" is Fakhruddin's. \"Kacchi Biryani\" is highly popular in Bangladeshi cuisine, with food critic and former MasterChef Australia judge Matt Preston praising its use of potatoes. Borhani is served as a drink alongside biryani. The Nawabi cuisine of Dhaka was notable for its \"patishapta\" dessert and the \"Kubali pulao\". The korma recipe of the Nawab family was included by Madhur Jaffrey in her cookbook \"Madhur Jaffrey's Ultimate Curry Bible\". Bakarkhani breads from Dhaka were served in the courts of Mughal rulers.\nSince 1939, Haji biryani has been a leading biryani restaurant in the city. Dhaka also has a style of \"Murag Pulao\" (chicken biryani) which uses turmeric and \"malai\" (cream of milk) together. Local kebabs are widely eaten when dining out. The seekh kebab and chicken tikka are the most popular dishes in kebab restaurants, which are eaten with either naan or paratha. Liver is often eaten with breads, as a stuffing, or as a curry. Star Kabab is the most popular kebab chain in the city, alongside other chains and gourmet restaurants. Different kinds of bhurta, which refers to mashed vegetables, are widely eaten. Various types of Bengali fish curry are found in the city. Along with South Asian cuisine, a large variety of Western and Chinese cuisine is served at numerous restaurants and food courts. Upmarket areas include many Thai, Japanese and Korean restaurants. Italian food is also very popular in Dhaka, especially in upmarket areas.\nDuring Ramadan, Chowkbazaar becomes a busy marketplace for \"iftar\" items. The \"jilapi\" of Dhaka are much thicker than counterparts in India and Pakistan. The Shahi jilapi (king's jilapi) is one of the thickest jilapi produced. The \"phuchka\" and \"jhalmuri\" are popular street food. Dhaka hosts an array of Bengali dessert chains that sell a wide variety of sweets. Samosas and \"shingaras\" are also widely eaten traditional snacks. In recent years, the number of Bangladeshi-owned burger outlets has increased across the city. Notable bakeries include the Prince of Wales bakery in Old Dhaka and the Cooper's chain.\nArchitecture.\nThe architectural history of Dhaka can be subdivided into the Mughal, British, and modern periods. As a result, Dhaka has landmarks of Mughal architecture, Indo-Saracenic architecture, and modernist architecture. The oldest brick structure in the city is the Binat Bibi Mosque, which was built in 1454 in the Narinda area of Dhaka during the reign of the Sultan Nasiruddin Mahmud Shah (r. 1435 \u2013 1459) of the Bengal Sultanate. Old Dhaka is home to over 2000 buildings built between the 16th and 19th centuries, which form an integral part of Dhaka's cultural heritage. Modern Dhaka is often criticized as a concrete jungle.\nIn the old part of the city, the fading grandeur of the Mughal era is evident in the crumbling, neglected caravanserai like Bara Katra and Choto Katra. Some structures like the Nimtali arch have been restored. The old city features narrow alleyways with high-walled lanes and houses with indoor courtyards. The early 20th century government quarter in Ramna includes stately colonial buildings set amidst gardens and parks. Among colonial buildings, the Curzon Hall stands out for \"synthesizing imperial grandiosity with sporadic Mughal motifs\".\nAmongst modernist buildings, the Grameenphone headquarters is described as \"a paradigm setter for corporate Bangladesh\". The Museum of Independence and its attached national monument were inspired by the \"land-water mysticism of deltaic Bengal\" and the \"evocative expansiveness of a Roman forum or the geographical assemblage of an Egyptian \"mastaba\" sanctuary\". Dhaka's Art Institute, designed by Muzharul Islam, was the pioneering building of Bengali regional modernism. The vast expanse of the national parliament complex was designed by Louis Kahn. It is celebrated as Dhaka's pre-eminent civic space. The national parliament complex comprises 200\u00a0acres (800,000\u00a0m2) in the heart of the city. The Kamalapur railway station was designed by American architect Robert Boughey. In the last few decades, Bangladesh's new wave of cultural architecture has been influenced by Bengali aesthetics and the environment. City Centre Bangladesh is currently the tallest building in the city.\nPublishing and media.\nIn 1849, the Katra Press became the first printing press in the city. The name alludes to the \"katra\", the Bengali word for caravanserai. In 1856, \"Dacca News\" became the first English-language newspaper in the city. The Dacca News Press was the first commercial printing press in the city. Books published in Dhaka stirred discourse in the social and literary circles of Bengal. The Bengal Library Catalogue records the expansion of the publishing industry during the 1860s. Between 1877 and 1895, there were 45 printing presses in Dhaka. Between 1863 and 1900, more than a hundred Islamic puthi were published in Dhaka. Bookshops sprang up in Chowkbazaar, Islampur, Mughaltuli, and Patuatuli. Albert Library was a den for left-wing activists. After partition, the number of publishing houses in Dhaka rose from 27 in 1947 to 88 in 1966. Prominent bookshops included Wheeler's Bookstall and Presidency Library. Banglabazaar has since become the hub of the book trade. Bookworm is a famous local book shop that has been located adjacent to the Prime Minister's Office for three decades until being ordered to relocate in 2022; it is now located in Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed Park.\nDhaka is the centre of the national media in Bangladesh. It is home to the state-owned Bangladesh Television and Bangladesh Betar. In recent years, the number of privately owned television channels and radio stations has increased greatly. There are over two dozen Bengali language television channels in the private sector, including 24-hour news channels. Radio is also popular across the city. Dhaka is home to national newspapers, including Bengali newspapers like \"Prothom Alo\", \"Ittefaq\", \"Inqilab\", \"Janakantha\", and \"Jugantor\"; as well as English language newspapers \"The Daily Star\", \"The Financial Express\", \"The Business Standard\", \"Dhaka Tribune\", and \"New Age\". Broadcast media based in Dhaka include Gaan Bangla, Banglavision, DBC News, Somoy TV, Independent TV and Ekattor.\nEducation and research.\nDhaka has the largest number of schools, colleges and universities of any Bangladeshi city. The education system is divided into five levels: primary (from grades 1 to 5), junior (from grades 6 to 8), secondary (from grades 9 to 10), higher secondary (from grades 11 to 12) and tertiary. The five years of primary education concludes with a Primary School Completion (PSC) Examination, the three years of junior education concludes with Junior School Certificate (JSC) Examination. Next, two years of secondary education concludes with a Secondary School Certificate (SSC) Examination. Students who pass this examination proceed to two years of higher secondary or intermediate training, which culminate in a Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) Examination. Education is mainly offered in Bengali. However, English is also widely taught and used. Many Muslim families send their children to attend part-time courses or even to pursue full-time religious education alongside other subjects, which is imparted in Bengali and Arabic in schools, colleges and madrasas.\nThere are 52 universities in Dhaka. Dhaka College is the oldest institution for higher education in the city and among the earliest established in British India, founded in 1841. Since independence, Dhaka has seen the establishment of numerous public and private colleges and universities that offer undergraduate and graduate degrees as well as a variety of doctoral programs. The University of Dhaka is the oldest public university in the country which has more than 30,000 students and 1,800 faculty staff. It was established in 1921 being the first university in the region. The university has 23 research centres and 70 departments, faculties, and institutes. Eminent seats of higher education include Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Jagannath University and Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University. Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP), situated in Mirpur Cantonment, is the largest public university affiliated with the armed forces. Dhaka Medical College is one of the oldest and largest medical colleges in the country. Founded in 1875, the Dhaka Medical School was the first medical school in British East Bengal, which became Sir Salimullah Medical College in 1962. Other government medical colleges are Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College, Mugda Medical College and Armed Forces Medical College, Dhaka.\nTwo Nobel laureates are prominently associated with the city, including Amartya Sen who grew up in the city during the 1930s and 1940s, and attended St. Gregory's School; and Muhammad Yunus, who studied at Dhaka University, founded the Grameen Bank and lives in the city.\nSports.\n (Mirpur Stadium) in Dhaka.\nCricket and football are the two most popular sports in Dhaka and across the nation. Teams are fielded in intra-city and national competitions by many schools, colleges and private entities. The Dhaka Metropolis cricket team represents Dhaka City in the National Cricket League, the oldest domestic first-class cricket competition in Bangladesh. The Dhaka Premier League is the only domestic List A cricket tournament now in Bangladesh. It gained List A status in 2013\u201314 season. In domestic Twenty20 cricket, Dhaka has a Bangladesh Premier League franchise known as Dhaka Capitals.\nDhaka has the distinction of having hosted the first official Test cricket match of the Pakistan cricket team in 1954 against India. The National Stadium, Dhaka was formerly the main venue for domestic and international cricket matches, but now exclusively hosts football matches. It hosted the opening ceremony of the 2011 Cricket World Cup, while the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium, exclusively used for cricket, hosted 6 matches of the tournament including two quarter-final matches. Dhaka has also hosted the South Asian Games three times, in 1985, 1993 and 2010. Dhaka is the first city to host the games three times. The National Stadium was the main venue for all three editions. Dhaka also hosted the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, along with Chittagong and Sylhet, in 2014.\nIn football, the Dhaka Derby between Mohammedan SC and Abahani Limited Dhaka is the biggest sports rivalry in the country. The two clubs have maintained their fierce rivalry over the years in the Bangladesh Football Premier League and previously in the historic Dhaka League, which is the second oldest football league in South Asia, officially commencing in 1948. The National Stadium in Dhaka has been the home venue for the national football team since 2005.

{"id": "56657", "revid": "50829003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56657", "title": "Dodoma", "text": "Capital of Tanzania\nDodoma (lit.\u2009'It has sunk' in Gogo), officially Dodoma City (\"Jiji Kuu la Dodoma\", in Swahili), is the capital city of Tanzania. With a population of 765,179, it is also the administrative capital of both Dodoma Municipal Council and the entire Dodoma Region. In July 2024, Dodoma officially surpassed Arusha to become the third largest city in Tanzania on both infrastructure and population measures.\nIn 1974, the Tanzanian government announced that Tanzania's national capital would be moved from Dar es Salaam to Dodoma for social and economic reasons and to centralise the capital within the country. It became the official capital in 1996.\nMuch of Dodoma's initial design did not come to fruition until the 21st century. In May 2023, the national government under President Samia Suluhu unveiled the new State House in Dodoma in a historic event stamping the relocation of government duties to the city. As a result, Dar es Salaam has remained the commercial and maritime capital of Tanzania, while also retaining the state house Ikulu and a number of government functions.\nGeography.\nLocated in the centre of the country, the town is west of the former capital at Dar es Salaam and south of Arusha, the headquarters of the East African Community. It is north of Iringa through Mtera. It is also west of Morogoro. It covers an area of of which is urbanized.\nHistory.\n20th century.\nOriginally a small market town known as Idodomya, the modern Dodoma was founded in 1907 by German colonists during construction of the Tanzanian central railway. The layout followed the typical colonial planning of the time with a European quarter segregated from a native village.\nIn 1967, following independence, the government invited Canadian firm Project Planning Associates Ltd to draw up a master plan to help control and organise the then capital of the country, Dar es Salaam, which was undergoing rapid urbanisation and population growth. The plan was cancelled in 1972, in part due to its failure to adequately address the historical and social problems associated with the city.\nIn 1974, after a nationwide party referendum, the Tanzanian government announced that the capital would be moved from Dar es Salaam to a more central location to create significant social and economic improvements for the central region and to centralise the capital within the country. The cost was estimated at \u00a3186 million and envisaged to take 10 years. The site, the Dodoma region, had been looked at as a potential new capital as early as 1915 by the then colonial power Germany, in 1932 by the British as a League of Nations mandate and again in the post-independence National Assembly in 1961 and 1966.\nWith an already-established town at a major crossroads, the Dodoma region had an agreeable climate, room for development and was located in the geographic centre of the nation. Its location in a rural environment was seen as the ujamaa heartland and therefore appropriate for a ujamaa capital that could see and learn from neighbouring villages and maintain a close relationship to the land.\nA new capital was seen as a more economically viable alternative than attempting to reorganise and restructure Dar es Salaam and was idealised as a way of diverting development away from continued concentration in a single coastal city that was seen as anathema to the government's goal of socialist unity and development. Objectives for the new capital included: that the city become a symbol of Tanzania's social and cultural values and aspirations; that the capital city function be supplemented by industrial-commercial development; and that the mistakes and features of colonial planning and modern big cities, such as excessive population densities, pollution and traffic congestion, be avoided.\nThe Capital Development Authority (CDA) invited three international firms to submit proposals for the best location and preparation of a master plan: Project Planning Associates Ltd., of Canada; Doxiadis Associates International, of Greece (who had worked on Pakistan's new capital of Islamabad); and Engineering Consulting Firms Association, of Japan. A fourth firm from Germany submitted a proposal without invitation.\nThe winner, decided by the CDA together with independent American consultants, was Project Planning Associates, the same Canadian consultants whose plan for Dar es Salaam was seen as inadequate and not responsive enough to the local conditions and needs for Tanzania's largest city. Their plan envisaged a city of 400,000 persons by 2000 and 1.3 million by 2020.\nThe official capital since 1996, Dodoma was envisaged as the first non-monumental capital city as opposed to the monumentality and hierarchy of other planned capital cities such as Abuja, Yamoussoukro, Bras\u00edlia and Washington, D.C. It rejected geometrical forms such as grid iron and radial plans as inappropriate as the urban form was intended to undulate and curve with the existing topography and not in conflict with it so as to retain its rural ujamaa feel. As befitted Tanzania's development at the time, the car was seen as secondary in importance to public transports such as buses which were then utilised by much of the population.\nIn 1974, Dodoma had a population of 40,000 and was chosen as the site of the new capital as opposed to nearby Hombolo or Ihumwa. The existing population size was not seen as an impediment while existing infrastructure would reduce construction costs.\nThe city, designed over , was meant to be \"the chief village in a nation of villages\", built at a human scale meant to be experienced on foot. Its basic principles follow the garden city model of a town set amongst a garden with green belts separating segregated zones for residents and industry.\nAs part of the move of the government, a capitol complex was envisaged and designs by international teams offered competing visions and versions of the siting and layout of a capitol complex. These competing proposals, some paid for by foreign governments as a form of aid and others by the firms involved, were presented as early as 1978.\n21st century.\nHowever, it was not until 2006 that the Chinese government delivered a finished parliament building in Dodoma. The final location of the parliament was not in its original intended location in the master plan, with that location now being developed as a site for a university.\nAs much of the initial design never came to fruition over the past 40 years, government offices and embassies have resisted moving offices to Dodoma. As a result, many government offices remain in Dar es Salaam, which remains the commercial and the de facto capital of Tanzania.\nDodoma was envisaged as a nation-building project to cement a newly post-colonial independence identity and direction in Tanzania, and is similar to projects in Nigeria (Abuja), C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (Yamoussoukro), Botswana (Gaborone), Malawi (Lilongwe) and Mauritania (Nouakchott).\nDemographics.\nOut of the total population, 199,487 people (48.5 percent) are male while 211,469 people (51.5 percent) are female. The average household size is 4.4 people. The Roman Catholic Church reports that 19.2% of the population are Roman Catholics. Dodoma is populated by different ethnic groups because it is a government administrative centre, although the indigenous ethnic groups are the Gogo, Rangi, and Sandawe. There are also small Indian minorities.\nThe population count as of 2022 was recorded as 3,085,625 in Dodoma region of 41,311\u00a0km2, while Dodoma city increased from 410,956 in 2012 to 765,179 in 2022, covering 2,607\u00a0km2, or annual rate of 6.4% in ten years.\nClimate.\nDodoma features a semi-arid climate with warm to hot temperatures throughout the year. While average highs are somewhat consistent throughout the year, average lows dip to in July. Dodoma averages of rainfall per year, the vast majority of which occurs during its wet season between December and April. The remainder of the year comprises the city's dry season.\nEducation.\nUniversities.\nThere are several universities in Dodoma, which include the Open University of Tanzania, which has campuses in several cities in Tanzania, St Johns University of Tanzania, owned by the Anglican Church of Tanzania, and University of Dodoma, with about 35,000 students. Both universities opened in 2007. In addition there is the Mipango Institute and the CBE.\nThe Anglican Church runs the only international school in Dodoma, Canon Andrea Mwaka School (\"CAMS\"). CAMS, established in 1950, provides education to children from Nursery to Form 4. The education is based on the English National curriculum and the school offers students the opportunity to take IGCSE examinations. An estimated 280 students are taught at the school. \nTransport.\nAirport.\nNorth of the city centre, Dodoma Airport is managed by the Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority. Flights are currently limited to small aircraft operated commercially by Precision Air, Air Tanzania, Auric Air, and Flightlink. However, in December 2019, a US$272M loan plan was announced to build a new, far bigger airport outside the city with increased runway length and weight-bearing capacity.\nRailway.\nThe city is served by Dodoma Railway Station, located near Kikuyu Avenue, through which runs the Central Railway Line, which connects Dodoma over a distance of with Dar es Salaam in the east. In 2019, Tanzania Railways commissioned a study into a Dodoma commuter rail network.\nPublic transport.\nA daladala station serves Dodoma on B129 south west of Dodoma.\nRoad link.\nThe Cairo-Cape Town Highway passes through Dodoma. A major highway connects Dodoma with Dar es Salaam via the Morogoro in the east. To the west, there are roads to Mwanza and Kigoma going through Singida and Tabora. The Great North Road links the city with Babati\nand Arusha to the north, via Kondoa and Iringa, Njombe, Songea, Mbeya and Vwawa to the south via Mtera.\nGovernment.\nThe Parliament of Tanzania is located in Dodoma. The office of the President of Tanzania and the headquarters of ministers of the Government of Tanzania completed the move to the Mtumba area of the city in October 2019.\nSports.\nThe city is represented in the Tanzanian Premier League by football club Dodoma Jiji FC, which used to be called Polisi Dodoma. The club is run by the city council of Dodoma. Other older clubs, include CDA, Waziri Mkuu, Kurugenzi, Mji Mpwapwa, and Dundee.\nThere is also a rising interest in other sports, particularly basketball.\nStadium.\nThe city hosts the Jamhuri Stadium on School Avenue.\nPlaces of worship.\nDodoma is home to many places of worship for people of multiple faiths. From Christian churches such as the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dodoma (Catholic Church), Anglican Church of Tanzania (Anglican Communion), Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania (Lutheran World Federation), Baptist Convention of Tanzania (Baptist World Alliance), and Assemblies of God to Muslim mosques including the Sunni Masjid (Nunge), Gaddafi Mosque and KSIJ Mosque. The city also hosts a Hindu Mandir, as well as a Sikh Gurudwara.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nDodoma is twinned with the following places:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of February\u00a02023[ [update]], Dushanbe had a population of 1,228,400, with this population being largely Tajik. Until 1929, the city was known in Russian as Dyushambe, and from 1929 to 1961 as Stalinabad, after Joseph Stalin. Dushanbe is located in the Gissar Valley, bounded by the Gissar Range in the north and east and the Babatag, Aktau, Rangontau and Karatau mountains in the south, and has an elevation of 750\u2013930 m. The city is divided into four districts: Ismail Samani, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, and Shah Mansur.\nIn ancient times, what is now or is close to modern Dushanbe was settled by various empires and peoples, including Mousterian tool-users, various neolithic cultures, the Achaemenid Empire, Greco-Bactria, the Kushan Empire, and Hephthalites. In the Middle Ages, more settlements began near modern-day Dushanbe such as Hulbuk and its famous palace. From the 17th to early 20th century, Dushanbe grew into a market village controlled at times by the Beg of Hisor, Balkh, and finally Bukhara, before being conquered by the Russian Empire. Dushanbe was captured by the Bolsheviks in 1922, and the town was made the capital of the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1924, which commenced Dushanbe's development and rapid population growth that continued until the Tajik Civil War. After the war, the city became capital of an independent Tajikistan and continued its growth and development into a modern city, today home to many international conferences.\nMuch of Dushanbe's education system dates from Soviet times and has a legacy of state control; today the largest university in Dushanbe, the Tajik National University, is funded by the government. Dushanbe International Airport is the primary airport serving the city. Other forms of transport include the trolleybus system dating from 1955, the small rail system, and the roads that traverse the city. Dushanbe's electricity is primarily hydroelectric, produced by the Nurek Dam, and the aging water system dates from 1932. Tajikistan's healthcare system is concentrated in Dushanbe, meaning that the major hospitals of the country are in the city. The city makes up 20% of Tajikistan's GDP and has large industrial, financial, retail, and tourism sectors. Parks and main sights of the city include Victory Park, Rudaki Park, the Tajikistan National Museum, the Dushanbe Flagpole, and the Tajikistan National Museum of Antiquities.\nEtymology.\nDushanbe was the location of a large bazaar that operated every Monday (in Tajiki Persian: \"\u0414\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0431\u0435\" \u200e lit. 'the second day [\u200e \"du\"] following Saturday [\u200e ]') named simply \"Dushanbe-Bazar\" ( \u062f\u0648\u0634\u0646\u0628\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0631\u200e) In late 1929, the city was renamed Stalinabad (the city of Stalin), but was reverted late 1961 as a result of de-Stalinization.\nHistory.\nAncient times.\nIn the Stone Age, Mousterian tool-users inhabited the Hisar Valley near modern-day Dushanbe. The Gissar culture, whose stone tools were discovered within modern-day Dushanbe at the confluence of the Varzob and Luchob, Bishkent culture, and Vakhsh culture all were thought to have inhabited the valley in the second millennium BC, during the Neolithic period, and were primarily involved in cattle breeding, agriculture, and weaving.\nNear Dushanbe International Airport, Bronze Age burials were discovered dating from the end of the second to the beginning of the first millennium BC. Achaemenid dishes and ceramics were found east of Dushanbe in Qiblai, as the city was controlled by the Achaemenids from the sixth century BC. Archaeological remnants of a small citadel dating to the fifth century BC have been discovered south and wedge-shaped copper axes have been discovered from the second century BC.\nThe Seleucids conquered the region in 312 BC. A small Greco-Bactrian settlement of about was dated to the end of the third century BC. The oldest coin found in the city is a Greco-Bactrian coin depicting Eucratides (r. 171\u2013145 BC) and another was found depicting Dionysus. There was also a Kushan city on the left bank of the Varzob river from the 2nd century BC to 3rd century AD containing burial sites from the time period. The Kushans created other settlements such as Garavkala, Tepai Shah, Shakhrinau, and Uzbekontepa. The Sasanian Empire invaded Sogdiana in the fifth century, possibly giving coins as tribute to the Kidarites which ended up on the site of today's city.\nThe ruins of a Buddhist monastery of the Hephthalite period of the late fifth to sixth century, now referred to as Ajina Tepe, lie in the Vaksh valley near Dushanbe. Other settlements from the Tokharistan period have also been discovered, like the town of Shishikona that was destroyed during the Soviet era and depopulated during the Mongol invasion. International trade picked up during this period in the region. A castle was also discovered dating from the time period. In 582, the Western Turkic Khaganate gained control over the region. In the seventh century, a Chinese pilgrim visited the region and mentioned the city of Shuman, possibly on the site of modern Dushanbe.\nAfter the Arab conquest, the Samanids controlled the region, which was involved in crafts and trade, and in the 10th-12th centuries the medieval city of Hulbuk developed near Dushanbe, which notably contained the palace of the governor of Khulbuk, \"an artistic treasure of the Tajik people\", among other smaller medieval settlements like Shishikhona. The Kharakhanids minted coins from 1018 to 1019 found in the city. The city came under the influence of the Ghurids from the 12th to 13th centuries.\nOther smaller settlements were founded during the Late Middle Ages after the Mongol invasion, such as Abdullaevsky and Shainak. Timur conquered the region during this time period and various other empires controlled the city. The city's economy started to rely more heavily on crafts and trade.\nMarket town.\nThe first time Dushanbe appeared in the historical record was in 1676, in a letter sent from the Balkh khan Subhonquli Bahodur to Fyodor III, the Tsar of Russia. However, the Balkh historian Mahmud ibn Wali mentioned the area in the 1630s in the book \"Sea of Secrets Regarding the Values of the Noble\". At first, the town was called \"Kasabai Dushanbe\" ( \u049b\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0438 \u0414\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0431\u0435), when it was under the control of Balkh. This name reflected both Dushanbe's status as a town, with Kasaba meaning town, and the influence of trade, as the name Dushanbe, which means Monday in Persian, was due to the large bazaar in the village that operated on Mondays. Dushanbe's location between the caravan routes heading east\u2013west from the Gissar Valley through Karategin to the Alay Valley, and north\u2013south to the Kafirnigan River and then to Vaksh Valley and Afghanistan through the Anzob Pass from the Fergana and Zeravshan valleys that ultimately led traders to Bukhara, Samarkand, the Pamirs, and Afghanistan incentivized the development of its market. At the time, the town had a population of around 7,000\u20138,000 with around 500\u2013600 households.\nBy 1826, the town was called \"Dushanbe Qurghan\" (, \"Dushanbe Qurghon\", with the suffix \"qur\u01a3on\" from Turkic \"qur\u011fan\", meaning \"fortress\"). It was first Russified as \"Dyushambe\" () in 1875. It had a caravanserai, a stopping point for travelers to Samarkand, Khujand, Kulob and the Pamirs. It boasted 14 mosques with maktabs, 2 madrassas, and 14 teahouses at the turn of the 19th century. At that time, the town was a citadel on a steep bank on the left bank of the Varzob River with 10,000 residents. It was a center for weaving, tanning, and iron smelting production in the region. Various states, including Hisor, exercised control over the city during the 18th and early 19th century despite Bukharan claims of sovereignty. In 1868, the Tsarist government established suzerainty over Bukhara. In the unstable environment of Russian intervention and local revolts, Bukhara took over the Dushanbe region, control over which the Emirate was able to sustain through the gradual establishment of a Russian-influenced centralized state. The first hospital in the village was constructed in 1915 by Russian investment and an early railroad was proposed to connect the market town with the Russian railway system in 1909, but was abandoned after a review determined the venture would not be profitable, although the town did have a functioning railroad to Kagan.\nIn 1920, the last Emir of Bukhara briefly took refuge in Dushanbe after being overthrown by the Bolshevik revolution. After the Red Army conquered the area the next year, he fled to Afghanistan on 4 March 1921. In February 1922, the town was taken by Basmachi troops led by Enver Pasha after a siege, but on 14 July 1922 again came under the power of the Bolsheviks soon before the death of Enver Pasha on 4 August 1922 outside of Dushanbe. It was a part of the Bukharan PSR until the formation of the Tajik ASSR.\nCapital of the Tajik ASSR.\nDushanbe was proclaimed the capital of the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic as a part of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic in October 1924, and the government started to function formally on 15 March 1925.\nDushanbe was chosen instead of larger-populated villages in Tajikistan because of its role as a crossroads of Tajikistan for its large market served as a meeting place for much of Tajikistan's population. Along with its market, there was a lively livestock trade as well as trade in fabrics, leather, tin products, and weapons. The mild Mediterranean climate was another reason Soviet authorities chose the city as the capital.\nBefore the Emir's relocation to the city, Dushanbe had the only Jewish population in Eastern Bukhara (of about 600) whom were involved in trade and tailoring. When the Emir moved to the city in 1920, however, the Jewish population's property was plundered and the Jews were relocated to Hisor. They were only let back into Dushanbe with its conquest by the Red Army, and in the 1920s and 1930s their population gradually increased with Bukharan immigrants. Dushanbe was also officially recognized as the capital of the Emirate of Bukhara during its waning days as it served as the last refuge of the last Emir of Bukhara during its conquest by the Soviet Union, possibly another motivating factor for the decision to establish the new ASSR's capital in the village. The population during Soviet conquest and Basmachi revolts declined from an already meager 3,140 in 1920 to only 283 in 1924 with only 40 houses still standing. To aid in the recovery, the Soviet authorities temporarily exempted much of the population from having to pay taxes. In 1923, the Soviets created Dushanbe's first telegraph link to Bukhara, initiated its first railroad to Termez, and set up a telephone switchboard in 1924. On 12 August 1924, the first newspaper of the town, \"Voice of the East\" (Russian: \"\u041e\u0432\u043e\u0437\u0438 \u0428\u0430\u0440\u043a\"), was published in Arabic and soon after a Russian-language paper, \"Red Tajikistan\" (Russian: \"\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0422\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\"), began publication. Power plants and electricity were introduced to Dushanbe during this time. By the end of 1924, the first regular plane routes from Dushanbe came into operation, with one connection to Bukhara and later one to Tashkent. The post office was also set up that year. Construction on the railroad commenced on 24 June 1926, and it was completed in November 1929, connecting Dushanbe with the Trans-Caspian railroad and kickstarting economic growth. In 1925, the first boy's boarding school was constructed in the capital. On 1 September 1927, the first pedagogical college opened in Dushanbe and in November the motor road from Dushanbe to Kulob was completed. Tajiks from the countryside were given assistance and free land plots in the capital to increase its population and development.\nCapital of the Tajik SSR.\nThe Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, previously the Tajik ASSR, separated from the Uzbek SSR in 1929, and its capital Dyushambe was renamed \"Stalinabad\" (Russian: ; Tajik: \"Stalinobod\") for Joseph Stalin on 19 October 1929, incorporating the nearby villages of Shohmansur, Mavlono, and Sari Osiyo.\nIn the years that followed, the city developed at a rapid pace. The Soviets transformed the area into a center for cotton and silk production, and tens of thousands of people relocated to the city. The population also increased with thousands of ethnic Tajiks migrating to Tajikistan from Uzbekistan following the transfer of Bukhara and Samarkand to the Uzbek SSR as part of national delimitation in Central Asia. Industry during the time period was limited, focused on local production, although it had expanded by nine times since 1913 by 1940. The first bus line began operating in 1930 and in 1938, Komsomol members constructed Komsomolskoye Lake in the city.\nMany of these projects occurred under the 1925\u20131932 mayoralty of Abdukarim Rozykov, one of the first mayors of Dushanbe, who sought to transform it into a \"model communist city\" through modernization and urban planning. Mikhail Kalitin continued the industrial development of Dushanbe, building the Komsomolskoye Lake and promoting industry in the city. Towards the end of this period, in the late 1930s, there were 4,295 buildings in Dushanbe.\nDuring World War 2, the population of Dushanbe and Tajikistan swelled with 100,000 evacuees from the Eastern Front that led to the deployment of 17 hospitals in the city. The city's industry also greatly increased during the war, as the Soviets wanted to move critical infrastructure far behind enemy lines, and industries like textile manufacturing and food processing grew. In 1954, there were 30 schools in the city; a medical institute named after Avicenna; the Stalinabad Academy of Sciences; the University of Stalinabad, which was founded in 1947 and had 1,500 students; and the Stalinabad Pedagogical Institute for Woman, established on 1 September 1953. In 1960, gas supply reached the capital through a gas pipeline opened from Kyzyl to Tumxuk to Dushanbe. On 10 November 1961, as part of de-Stalinization, Stalinabad was renamed back to Dushanbe, the name it retains to this day. In 1960, under the leadership of Mahmudbek Narzibekov, the first zoo was built in the city. Later in the decade the mayor developed a plan to end the housing shortage and provide free apartments.\nThe Nurek Dam, which was the tallest dam in the world at the time, was completed south east of Dushanbe during the 1960s. The Rogun Dam, upstream from Nurek Dam, was started in that period as well. They were both megaprojects meant to showcase Soviet innovation and development in Tajikistan. However, while the Nurek Dam was completed, the Rogun Dam was cancelled in the 1970s because of stagnating Soviet economic growth. On 2 August 1979, the population of Dushanbe reached 500,000, and it had the highest population growth rate in the Soviet Union.\nRiots and unrest.\nIn the 1980s, environmental problems and crime began to increase. Mass violence, hooliganism, binge drinking, and violent assaults became more common. There was an attack on foreign students at the Agricultural Institute in 1987 and a riot in the Pedagogical Institute two years later. Increasing regionalism also destabilized the SSR.\nOn 10\u201311 February 1990, 300 demonstrators gathered at the Communist Party Central Committee building after it was rumored that the Soviet government planned to relocate tens of thousands of Armenian refugees to Tajikistan. In reality, only 29 Armenians went to Dushanbe and were housed by their family members. However, the crowd kept growing in size to 3-5 thousand people; soon after, violence broke out. Martial law was quickly declared and troops were sent in to protect ethnic minorities and defend against vandalism and looting. The number of people protesting increased significantly, however, and they attacked the Central Committee building. The 29 Armenians were quickly evacuated on an emergency flight after shots were fired.\nA few days after, and with looting still occurring throughout the city, demonstrators created the Provisional People's Committee, or the Temporary Committee for Crisis Resolution, which put forward demands such as \"the expulsion of Armenian refugees, the resignation of the government and the removal of the Communist Party, the closure of an aluminum smelter in western Tajikistan for environmental reasons, equitable distribution of profits from cotton production, and the release of 25 protesters taken into custody.\"\nMany high-ranking officials resigned and the protector's goal of toppling the government was almost successful, but Soviet troops moved into the city, declared the demands illegal, and rejected the resignation of the high-ranking officials. 16-25 people were killed in the violence; many if not most were Russian.\nThe riots were largely fueled by concerns about housing shortages for the Tajik population, but they coincided with a wave of nationalist unrest that swept Transcaucasia and other Central Asian states during the twilight of Mikhail Gorbachev's rule.\nAfter the increase of organized opposition from the Democratic Party of Tajikistan and Rastokhez, glasnost by Gorbachev, economic contraction, and increased opposition by regional elites, Qahhor Mahkamov disbanded the Communist Party of Tajikistan on 27 August 1991 and quit the party the next day. On 9 September 1991, Tajikistan's government declared independence from the Soviet Union.\nCapital of Tajikistan.\nDushanbe became the capital of an independent Tajikistan on 9 September 1991. Iran, the United States, and Russia soon opened embassies in Dushanbe in early 1992.\nDushanbe was controlled by the Popular Front-supported government during most of the 1992\u20131997 Tajikistani Civil War, although the Islamist and Democratic United Tajik Opposition managed to capture the capital in 1992 until 8000 Russian-backed and Uzbekistani-backed government troops regained control of Dushanbe. Most of the Russian population fled the capital during the violence of this time period while large amounts of rural Tajiks moved in; by 1993, more than half of the Russian population had fled. The factions during the civil war were organized primarily upon regional lines. The war was ended by a 27 June 1997 armistice, administered by the UN, that guaranteed the opposition 30% of the positions in the government.\nIn 2000, Dushanbe received internet access for the first time. In 2004, the UNESCO declared Dushanbe as a city of peace. Mahmadsaid Ubaidulloev was declared mayor of Dushanbe in 1996, after during the civil war era many said he was in real control of the government. He was the mayor of the capital for the longest term of any mayor, 21 years, until 2017. From independence, the city's economy has grown consistently up until the COVID-19 recession. In January 2017, Rustam Emomali, current President Emomali Rahmon's son, was appointed Mayor of Dushanbe, a move which is seen by some analysts as a step to reaching the top of the government.\nGeography.\nDushanbe is situated at the confluence of two rivers, the Varzob (flowing from north to south) and the Kofarnihon. It is \u2013 above sea level; in the south and west, the elevation is closer to \u2013, while in the north and northeast it reaches \u2013. The north and east of the city is bounded by the Gissar range, which can reach up to above sea level, and is bounded on the south by the Babatag, Aktau, Rangontau and Karatau mountains which reach a height from \u2013 above sea level; Dushanbe, therefore, is an intermontane basin located in the Gissar Valley. It has a primarily hilly terrain. 80% of Dushanbe's buildings are located within the valley, which has a width of approximately \u2013. Before the 1960s, most of Dushanbe was located on the left bank of the Varzob river, but increased construction led to the city expanding across it.\nDushanbe is located in an area with high seismicity. The magnitude of potential earthquakes is thought to reach a maximum of 7.5-8. Over the past 100 years, many earthquakes from a 5-6 magnitude have been felt in the city, such as the 1949 Khait earthquake.\nClimate.\nDushanbe features a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa), with some humid continental climate influences (K\u00f6ppen: Dsa) due to the nearby glaciers and mountain range. The city features hot summers and chilly winters. The climate is damper than other Central Asian capitals, with an average annual rainfall over as moist air is funneled by the surrounding valley during the winter and spring. Winters are not as cold as north of the Gissar Range owing to the shielding of the city by mountains from extremely cold air from Siberia. Snow occurs on an average of 25 days a year and cloudy days make up an average of 24 a year. However, precipitation in winter typically falls as rain and not snow. The surrounding mountains prohibit strong winds from entering the city, although there are consistent mild breezes.\nWinter in Dushanbe begins on 7 December and ends on 22 February; spring starts on 22 February and ends on 17 May. During springtime, cyclones and rain are at their highest along with thunderstorms and hail, which causes significant damage and occurs for around 3 days per year. Summer starts on 17 May and ends on 14 August, the best period for agriculture. Dry weather sets in during this, as evidenced by a sharp drop in precipitation during the summer. A warm and dry autumn begins on 14 August and ends on 7 December.\nFlora and fauna.\nBefore the 20th century, the city had some vegetation such as bushes of Bukhara almonds, but the creation of the city mostly removed natural vegetation. The green belt, however, and the botanical garden introduced new vegetation to the city. The city has over 150 species of trees and shrubs, with only about 15 native to the city and 22% of the city being occupied by green space.\nThere are 14 identified species of mammals in urban Dushanbe, including a fox, a weasel, the marbled polecat, the long-eared hedgehog, five bats, and five rodents. There are 130 identified bird species in the city, such as rock pigeons, blue pigeons, and turtle doves. Migratory birds are common, often staying only in fall and summer. There are 47 identified reptiles in Dushanbe, such as geckos, snakes, lizards, and turtles. Amphibians, like the marsh frog and the green toad, live in the cleaner water bodies of the city. The 14 identified fish species of Dushanbe live in the rivers, lakes, and ponds of the city. Some species are the marinka, the Tajik char, and the Turkestan catfish in the Varzob rivers, along with 7 in the Kofarnikhon, and species like carp, goldfish, striped swine, and mosquito fish in the lakes and ponds. 300 identified species of insects inhabit the city, mostly cicadas, psyllids, aphids, scale insects, bugs, beetles, and butterflies. The endemic Hissar grape hawk moth lives in the city as well, and malaria-carrying insects have been increasing in the city. Phytonematodes are a menace to plants in the city, with 55 distinct identified species, the most damaging of which are the root gall nematodes. Rare or endangered species include the radiant tachysphex, the white-bellied arrow eagle, and the European free-tailed bat.\nDistricts.\nDushanbe is divided into the following districts:\nIn 2020, the city's boundaries were expanded to take in land from Rudaki District in the southwest.\nMain sights.\nSome of Dushanbe's major sights include the Tajikistan National Museum; the National Museum of Antiquities; the Ismaili Centre; Vahdat Palace; the Dushanbe Flagpole, which is the second tallest free-standing flagpole in the world, at a height of ; the Dushanbe Zoo; Rudaki Avenue, the main street of the capital; the Gurminj Museum of Musical Instruments; and the National Library, the largest in Central Asia, with 3.11 million copies of books.\nDemographics.\nThe population of Dushanbe grew at a rapid pace following the Soviet invasion of the 1920s, declined during the Tajik Civil War and rising unrest of the 1990s, and resumed its growth after that period. During the mid 20th century, the city had a majority Russian/Eastern European population, but after the civil war, many Russians departed the city and the Tajik population became predominant. From 2005 to 2014, 53,118 people migrated to the city in total. The average life expectancy of Dushanbe in 2014 was 74.1 years overall, with 71.9 years for men and 76.3 for women. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt; View .&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nThe main languages spoken in Dushanbe are the two official languages, Tajik and Russian, along with the widely-spoken minority language Uzbek.\nReligion.\nIslam was introduced to Dushanbe in the eighth century and today, the majority of the city follows Sunni Islam. There is a small Catholic community of 120 in the city at St Joseph Church. There are around 350 Jews in Tajikistan, whose synagogue was destroyed in 2006 but was replaced in 2008.\nOn 9 September 2009, Mayor Mahmadsaid Ubaidulloyev endorsed the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's plan to recognize Dushanbe as the 2010 capital of Islamic culture. In October 2009, President Emomali Rahmon launched the construction of a new central mosque in Dushanbe built at the expense of Qatari investors. It will replace the existing Haji Yakub Mosque and should become the largest in Central Asia. Construction began in 2011 with an original opening date in 2014; however in February 2021, its revised opening date was delayed.\nThe Russian Orthodox Church is another religious group in the city. St. Nicholas Cathedral in Dushanbe is a center of worship for the Orthodox community.\nEducation.\nBefore the Soviet invasion, education was limited in Dushanbe, mainly consisting of madrasas that taught the Quran and Persian and Arabic along with geography, geometry, algebra, and other sciences. After the invasion, the Soviet Union closed the madrasas down. \nThe Soviet education system was considered a success for its time, achieving close to 100% literacy through a large scale literacy program and compulsory education along with the inclusion of girls in education.\nThe People's Commissariat of Education of the Tajik SSR was created on 11 February 1925 in Dushanbe. Higher education began to be established in the 1930s with the creation of a pedagogical institute in Dushanbe in 1931. In 1939, the Tajik State Medical University was founded in Dushanbe and soon after in 1944 the Tajik Agrarian Institute moved to Dushanbe. Before the outbreak of World War Two, there were 32 secondary schools and two institutes in the city. While World War 2 slowed the growth of higher education, afterwards in 1947 the Tajik State University was created. In 1956 a polytechnic institute was created in the city along with the Institute of Physical Culture in 1971, the Institute of Arts in 1973, and the Tajik Pedagogical Institute of Russian Language and Literature in 1980 which became the Tajik State Institute of Languages in 1987. In 1990, the Technological University of Tajikistan was founded.\nThe Soviet system was based on the needs of the economy; the agrarian, medical, and polytechnic institutes were all founded to aid the economy. Outside of that, most higher education in the system were in the form of pedagogical colleges. Restrictions on political subjects such as history hampered advancements in those fields. After independence, universities less precisely tailored their courses to the economy and as a result other professions proliferated in schools such as the Tajik University of Law, Business and Politics.\nThe civil war after independence devastated the education system of the city, with state budgets falling from 11% to 2% during the time period. While state spending declined, private institutions temporarily developed in the market economy, accounting for growth in the number of universities in Dushanbe after independence.\nThe modern state university in Dushanbe, the Tajik State Pedagogical University, has an enrollment in the thousands. Institutions such as the Tajik Technical University, the Tajik Agrarian University, the Tajik State University of Commerce and the Technological University of Tajikistan, some of which existed during the Soviet era, grew and admitted anywhere from 5000 to 9000 students. Specialized and technical schools also expanded significantly. Today, 60% of university students in Tajikistan are enrolled in Dushanbe, which has 23 universities with 103,600 students, 13 colleges with 16,100 students enrolled and 140 schools that have 180,800 students. As of 2015, there is one national university in Dushanbe, the Tajik National University, 7 specialized universities, 4 international bilateral institutions, and 12 institutes in the capital. In the 2018/2019 academic year, there were 23 higher education institutions with 103,600 students. There were also 124 preschools and 140 general education schools in the city.\nThe Russian-language Russian-Tajik Slavonic University was created in the 1990s during a trend of closure of Russian language instruction due to the exodus of Russians during the civil war. The Islamic Institute of Tajikistan, created with the goal of countering Islamic extremism, had 924 students as of 2020. The University of International Relations, which was founded by a Tajik-American, was founded in opposition to the government and produced opposition leaders until it was shut down. In 2009, due to the efforts of Emomali Rahmon, a Dushanbe branch of the Moscow State University was opened. 70% of the instructors are Russian, while only 30% are Tajik. Other branches of Russian universities in Dushanbe include a branch of the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloy and a branch of the Moscow Energy Institute.\nThe Tajik National University is the most prominent in the city and the country. With an enrollment of over 21,000 students and a large number of programs it is the flagship university of Tajikistan. Uniquely, the university is directly funded by the government while also being more independent of it compared to other state universities. While in principle this provides academic freedom, in reality the government is still heavily involved, censors content, and controls appointments at the university. Dushanbe's education system is still heavily managed by the national government, a relic of Soviet times. Other schools include the Tajikistan Humanitarian International University, the Dushanbe International School, and the Tax Law Institute, now the Tajik State University of Finance and Economics.\nTransportation.\nAir transport.\nRashid Beck Ahriev and Peter Komarov piloted the first flight to the city from Bukhara on 3 September 1924 on a Junkers F-13; the service ran three times a week from small airfield on modern day Rudaki Avenue. In 1927, the second air route in the Soviet Union opened from Tashkent to Samarkand to Termez to Dushanbe on the Junkers F-13, two years before the introduction of automobiles and five before the railway. A small Stalinabad airport was created, and in 1930 a first-class airport was constructed in the city. The first scheduled flight from the city began in 1945 on the Li-2. The state airline, Tojikiston - now known as Tajik Air - was created in 1949. In the 50s and 60s, many new aircraft were introduced to the Tajik Civil Air Fleet. The Tajik Civil Aviation Administration won first place in the USSR for efficiency in the 1980s.\nThe city is served by Dushanbe International Airport which, as of April 2015, had regularly scheduled flights to \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, Kabul, Delhi, Dubai, Istanbul, Frankfurt, and major cities in Russia and Central Asia, amongst others. Tajik Air had its head office on the grounds of Dushanbe Airport in Dushanbe. Somon Air, which opened in 2008, has its head office in Dushanbe. The government planned to devote .18% of Tajikistan's GDP to the development of aviation in a large part in Dushanbe. Japanese investors created a cargo terminal at the airport, costing $28 million.\nRoad system.\nThe first road in the country, from the early 19th century, was to Guzor, traversed by camels, and made into a modern road by the Soviets. The first bus line was started in 1930 and taxi service began in 1937. Automobiles are the main form of transportation in the country and in Dushanbe. One major road goes through the mountains from Khujand to Dushanbe through the Anzob Tunnel, constructed by an Iranian operator. A second major road goes east from Dushanbe to Khorog in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province, then to Murghab, and then splits into roads towards China and Kyrgyzstan.\nMany highway and tunnel construction projects are underway or have recently been completed (as of 2014[ [update]]). Major projects include rehabilitation of the Dushanbe \u2013 Chanak (Uzbek border), Dushanbe \u2013 Kulma (Chinese border), Bokhtar \u2013 Nizhny Pyanj (Afghan border) highways and construction of tunnels under the mountain passes of Anzob, Shakhristan, Shar-Shar and Chormazak.\nRail transport.\nThe first rail line in Dushanbe, which was long, was built from 1926 to 1929 and opened on 10 September 1929 from Vhadat to Dushanbe to Termez that ultimately connected Dushanbe with Moscow. In 1933 and 1941, two other narrow-gauge railroad lines were laid from Dushanbe, to Gulpista and Kurgan-Tyube. In 2002, a new railroad administration took over that modernized the system.\nToday, Tajikistan's principal railways are in the southern region and connect Dushanbe with the industrial areas of the Gissar and Vakhsh valleys and with Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Russia. Tajikistan's railways are owned and operated by Tajik Railway. In the early 2000s, a new railway line from Dushanbe to Gharm to Jirghatol was constructed that would connect the country to Russia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan while not going through Uzbekistan due to contemporary geopolitical tensions. A proposed line from Dushanbe to Herat and Mashad is also being promoted by the government. On 18 June 2018, the first railway between Dushanbe and Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, completed its trip through Uzbekistan's Karakalpakstan region. Tajikistan's northern railway system remains isolated from its other railway lines, including those of Dushanbe. There is also a service from Dushanbe to Khujand and the northern Uzbek town of Pakhtaabad.\nTrolleybus system.\nThe Dushanbe trolleybus system began on 6 April 1955 when a trolleybus administration was organized in the city. On 1 May 1955, the first Trolza trolleybus began operation on Lenin Avenue, the main avenue of Dushanbe. Routes continued to be added in 1957 and 1958 and in 1967, 9 routes were opened and the length of the network reached . The collapse of the Soviet Union led to a crisis in the system, as fuel increased in price and looting became a consistent problem, with one incident occurring at the central bus station leading to the temporary suspension of lines. During the period, the number of trolleybuses declined from a high of 250 during the late 1980s to only 45\u201350. 100 new trolleybuses were ordered in 2004 which were delivered a couple years after and aided in the resumption of service.\nIn 2020, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development gave $8 million to repair the system. As of 2020, Dushanbe had 7 trolleybus routes with 11 million passengers a years. While trolleybuses were the main mode of transport in the Soviet era, today they account for only 2% of motorized trips.\nDushanbe trolleybuses are based upon the ZiU-9 trolleybus design.\nMetro system.\nThe construction of an above-ground metro system is due to begin in 2025. The first aerial metro line is expected to be completed in 2040 and connect the Southern Gate and Gulliston (circus area).\nInfrastructure.\nArchitecture.\nBefore the Soviet invasion, Dushanbe consisted of narrow streets with adobe buildings. None of the buildings from that time survived. The development of the 1920s, soon after the Soviet invasion, laid the groundwork for future development and established the beginning of the city. In the 1930s, constructivist architecture gained prominence along with the building of larger structures, often made out of concrete. Several architects played a major role in the city's construction in a group headed by Peter Vaulin. He drew up a piece of legislation called \"On the construction of the city of Dushanbe\" which the city adopted on 27 April 1927. He implemented a constructivist design in the city, possibly inspired by his meeting with Le Corbusier in Moscow in 1929.\nIn 1934 and 1935, the Griprogor Institute, based in Leningrad, created a master plan for the construction of Dushanbe. It was approved on 3 March 1938. The city center during the reconstruction shifted to Red Square and Frunze Park, the location of many workers demonstrations and military parades into the forties. In the later half of the decade, much of the modern infrastructure and utilities for the city were created. In the 1940s, architecture was focused more on decoration and the neoclassical style.\n1955 heralded in a new era of architecture with the publication of \"On the elimination of excesses in the design,\" which eventually ended the neoclassical period and integrated the city architecture into modernist, minimalistic Soviet trends. In 1966, a new master plan for the city was created due to the city's rapid growth. The first skyscraper in Dushanbe, the Hotel Dushanbe, was erected in 1964. High-rise buildings were developed in the mid-70s against the wishes of the Tajik Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology, which viewed such developments as dangerous in an earthquake which they predicted would occur in the near future.\nIn the 1980s, more technically complex and creative designs were built by a new generation of architects along with more attention on ecological issues. In the late 1990s, more 9-12 story concrete houses were built and private companies grew to 75% of the housing market. Minimalist influences continued to be felt from the 60s up to the 90s.\nIn the 21st century, new construction projects such as tall skyscrapers, a new parliament building, and the national museum were or are being built. However, the new architectural styles of the modern day resulted in the demolition of many historical, Soviet-era buildings in the center of the city, such as the Central Post Office and the Mayakovsky Theatre, with the exception of a small list of 15 historically significant buildings. The central city mainly consists of wide boulevards and Russian-style buildings today, while suburban areas are comparatively underdeveloped.\nElectricity.\nIn the 1930s, the use of hydroelectricity began to take off in Dushanbe, leading it to be one of the most advanced in terms of energy production in the Soviet Union at the time; today, 96% of Tajikistan's power comes from hydroelectricity. In Dushanbe, 990 million kWh were generated in 1980 which reached 1161 million kWh in 1985 but decreased significantly in 2001.\nIn 2007, there was a major energy crisis because of the cold winter in Dushanbe that rendered Dushanbe's Soviet-era energy system ineffective and caused a severe crisis due to lack of heating. Since 2007, there have been energy shortages during the winter in Dushanbe. In 2009, Tajikistan's energy trade with other countries was suspended, and in 2012, natural gas imports from Uzbekistan were cut off, which further exacerbated the crisis, although the natural gas imports were restored in 2018. The Nurek hydroelectric dam, as of 2016, provides around 3/4 of the country's power. New hydroelectric plants are being planned and in 2017, the government proclaimed an end to the rolling blackouts; however, in 2020, rolling blackouts continued. Barqi Tojik is the major energy producer for the city and produces 75% of the electricity in the country. To alleviate the energy crisis, a second coal plant for the city is planned with extensive Chinese involvement, but has been criticized for pollution and negative environmental effects.\nVarzob's three power plants generated 150 million kWh per year in 2004, and Dushanbe's power supply, built on the idea of a double ring, has an outer ring of power transmission lines from Nurek Dam to Dushanbe to Yovon at a voltage of 220\u00a0kW and an inner ring which covers the perimeter of the city and consists of 110\u00a0kW power lines.\nWater and sanitation.\nTajikistan has the highest average annual precipitation in its region, along with numerous rivers, natural lakes (such as Lake Karakul), and glaciers. Most of the outdated Dushanbe water system was built during the Soviet era in 1932 and not significantly expanded afterwards even with a rising population. The Big Gissar Canal was constructed in 1942 and irrigates much of southern Tajikistan and goes from the Kofarnihon river to the Surxondaryo. As of 2004, the length of the city's water supply network was and mainly got its water from the Varzob, Kofarnikhon and the South-West. Water is supplied through two ground and two surface water treatment plants. As of 2018, 40% of the city's population did not have access to sewage systems.\nParks.\nAs of 2020, there are 15 parks in Dushanbe. One of the most well known is Rudaki Park, created in the mid-1930s along with a bronze statue of Lenin. The park was renovated in 2007. Another park is Victory Park, which was created in 1975 to commemorate the Great Patriotic War. The Botanical Garden of the Academy of Sciences of Tajikistan was founded in 1933, and trees planted then are still prominent in the park. In 2007 a collection of folk architecture was added the park.\nCemeteries.\nThere are 5 main and 14 unrecognized cemeteries in Dushanbe. One of the 5 mains ones is Mekhrobod, founded in 2013, that consists of 74 acres of primarily tombstones. For a period of 9 months in 2019, 78 people were buried there. Luchob cemetery, also one of the five, uses commemorative steles to remember the dead and houses more well-known figures. As of October 2019, 54 people were buried there such as Jabbor Rasulov, Bobojon Ghafurov, Muhammad Osimi, Mirzo Tursunzade, Loik Sherali, Muhammadjon Shakuri, Malika Sabirova, Tufa Fozylova, and Mukaddima Ashrafi. It was founded in 1977 and uses the smallest amount of land of the five. In 2017, the government secretly moved many national figures from Aini park to Luchob cemetery, sparking outrage.\nSari Osiyo, founded in 1933, is another one of the five cemeteries. It is one of the oldest in the city and has graves from the late 19th century. For the 9-month period in 2019, 225 were buried here. The Christian cemetery is another one of the five, the least visited although frequented by the 201st Russian division. It uses 84.3 hectares of land and saw 197 new graves over the same nine-month period. Shokhmansur is the last of the five main cemeteries and saw 65 burials over the 9-month period. The Jewish cemetery of the city, one of the fourteen unofficial ones, is looked after by the Congress of Bukharian Jews.\nHealthcare.\nIn 1925, Dushanbe city hospital and the ambulance system was created, and numerous medical facilities sprung up during the decade. In 1939, an infectious disease hospital was created and in the same year the Stalinabad Medical Institute was founded. During World War 2 up to the Tajik Civil War, the healthcare system significantly expanded through hospitals and specialized clinics.\nTajikistan's health care system is concentrated in Dushanbe. There is a well-developed network of city clinics, hospitals, medical centers, maternity hospitals, orphanages, sanitary and epidemiological centers - a total of 62 medical institutions in the city as of spring 2010. These 62 treatment and prevention facilities include 17 hospitals, 2 orphanages, 14 city health centers, 5 dental clinics, 8 centers of sanitary and epidemiological surveillance and disincentives, 12 city branch centers and 4 support centers. In 2019, the number of hospitals grew to 43. Primary health care for Dushanbe residents (and guests of the city) is provided in 39 institutions (city health centers, dental clinics, centers for sanitary and epidemiological surveillance and de-stations, city branch centers).\nAmong the main medical institutions of Dushanbe are specialized republican hospitals and centers, city polyclinics No. 1-5, the city infectious diseases hospital, the children's infectious diseases hospital, and the departmental hospitals of the country's power ministries. Citizens receive care through their assigned clinics in the city. Some hospitals in Dushanbe include the Mansurov Clinic, the Tajik Railways Hospital, the Shifobakhsh National Medical Center, and the Istiqlol Medical Complex. Khoja Obi Garm, a Soviet-era sanatorium, still is in operation today and uses radon treatments, among others. Temporary hospitals were established during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEconomy.\nIn 2018, the gross regional product (GRP) of Dushanbe was 13,808,000,000 somoni, equaling approximately $1,508,900,000, with a growth rate of 7.3%. That comprised 20.1% of the overall GDP of Tajikistan. In the first half of 2020, the GRP of Dushanbe was 20.7% of the GDP of the country. The average salary of the city as of 2014[ [update]] is 1402.67 somoni, or $. As the center of financial activity of the republic, Dushanbe housed more than 30 commercial banks in 2004.\nDushanbe has extensive international trade. Exports from Dushanbe consisted of $8,343,200 during the first half of 2019, and overall foreign trade turnover was $398,080,900 in 2018. The primary countries Dushanbe exports to are Turkey (42.8% of the total), Iran (28.0%), Russia (10.8%), Afghanistan (7.3%), China (1.2%), Poland (1.2%), and others. For imports, Russia makes up 54.5% of the total, Kazakhstan 13.5%, China 6.8%, Italy 3.4%, Turkey 2.6%, Turkmenistan 2.5%, Ukraine 2.1%, Iran 1.4%, the United Arab Emirates 1.2%, and others make up the rest. \nDuring and during the decade after the Soviet invasion, most industries were focused on meeting local demand with local materials. Meat packing, soap production, bricks, lumber, silk thread, leather, clothing, and generation of electric power were all local industries during the time period. In 1932, 776 workers were employed in industry, while in 1938, 12 thousand were. During World War 2, the city's industry grew significantly with the Soviet decision to relocate industry eastwards to cities like Dushanbe, specifically light industries like textile manufacturing and food processing. Industry output increased by 2.5 times from 1940 to 1945. About 1/3 of the industrial and white-collar labor force of Tajikistan is located in Dushanbe, despite containing less than 10 percent of Tajikistan's population. From January to August 2019, there were 455 manufacturing companies in Dushanbe, producing 1,644,745,400 Somoni worth of products. The majority of that, 63.9%, was from the processing industry, 34.5% was from electricity, water, gas, and air purification, and the other 1.6% was from the non-metallic construction industry. The industry produces over 300 types of products. Exports from the industrial sector consisted of $1,535,500 during the time period.\nThe main industrial products exported from the city are cotton yarn, finished cotton fabrics, hosiery, cable products, agricultural products, tobacco products, and trade equipment, among others. Industry, as of 2019, employed 20746 people, with an average salary of 1428.02 somoni. Light industry is the most mature industry in the city, aided by the location of raw materials in the country. Some large companies in light industry are Nassoch, which processes large amounts of cotton fiber, Chevar and Guliston, which both produce garments, and Nafisa, which produces hosiery. The electrical, engineering, and metallurgical industries are also prominent in the republic. Tajiktekstilmash, which produces varied products for agriculture and electricity, and Tajikcable, which produces cables, are two well known companies from that sector of the economy. Somon-Tachkhizot, which produces electronic goods, Torgmash, which produces goods for trading companies, and Valve Plant, which produces iron products are some other prominent companies in the industry. The food processing industry also has a presence in the city with many wineries, dairy and meatpacking plants, canneries, and bakeries all in the city. Various other industries exist in the city as well. These include the building materials industry, which produces cement, oil (with 3 main gas deposits) and plastics; the wood industry; and the printing industry, which consists of 80% of the republic's capacity and began in 1926.\nIn 2014, the retail sector was involved in 2.6 billion somoni of transactions. In the service sector, hotels, restaurants, canteens and cafes sold services worth 296.6 million somoni. The paid services of the city in 2014 amounted to 5662.2 somoni per capita.\nDushanbe is the capital of tourism of the Economic Cooperation Organization and is served by more than 40 hotels. The building of 9 modern hotels, with room for more than 1000 people, is being planned.\nIn 2018 and 2019, numerous initiatives, such as Dushanbe becoming a member of the World Tourism Cities Federation, different festivals, legislation promoting the city, an art gallery, and the establishment of the Year of Tourism and Folk Crafts in 2018 all served to promote the tourism industry. The Dushanbe Summer Fest, another promoted festival, is notable for its internet connectivity. Compared with the rest of the country, however, Dushanbe is a less popular tourist destination, partially due to its relatively recent founding and lack of historical significance. Museums in the city include the Tajikistan National Museum, founded in 1934, and the Gurminj Museum of Musical Instruments, which contains Pamiri and Badakshani musical instruments.\nCulture.\nCulture in Dushanbe, first developed during the period of Bukharan rule, grew under the Soviet Union, which established many of the first cultural institutions of the city. After independence, Dushanbe's culture went in a more nationalist direction.\nPerforming arts.\nDuring the 19th century, shashmaqam was the most prevalent musical genre in Tajikistan. While Soviet authorities labeled it as \"music composed for the Emir\" and repressed it, in modern times it has gained greater popularity.\nDuring the Soviet period, the Soviet Union encouraged the development of music in Dushanbe, a less culturally crowded place then typical Russian megacities. Revolutionary songs, like the Marseillaise, were promoted and translated into Tajik. The Tajik Philharmonic Society was founded in 1938; today, it is named after Akasharif Juraev. Sergei Artemevich Balasanyan, an Armenian, was one composer who originally went to Dushanbe from 1936\u20131943 to prepare the SSR for an upcoming Tajik cultural festival to be held in Moscow. While we was there, he described himself as a \"composer, social-musical worker, folklorist, and pedagogue.\" He also became the head of the Tajik Composer's Union and the artistic lead of the opera house. Large numbers of Russian and Ukrainian symphonies moved to Dushanbe during World War 2.\nThe , whose building was named after Sadriddin Ayni and was the first opera house in Dushanbe, was founded in 1936. The first opera performed, the first in history of Tajikistan, was The Vose Uprising and detailed a peasants' revolt in eastern Bukhara in the late 19th century. One notable singer of the opera was Hanifa Mavlianova.\nAnother musician to come to Dushanbe during the Soviet period was Aleksandr Lensky, a Moldovan who came to Tajikistan in 1937. He was the artistic director of the Lahuti Theatre, director of the Tajik Philharmonic, and first secretary of the Tajik Union of Composers. He also composed the first Tajik opera and many orchestral pieces. Another orchestra in Dushanbe is the Opera Orchestra. The State Symphony Orchestra of Tajikistan was founded in 2016, and its first concert took place on 9 September 2016. The Tajik Opera and Ballet Theater continues operating to this day and has won the Order of Lenin. At various times the opera house performed operas on modern, historical, national, revolutionary, and heroic themes.\nThe Tajik Opera and Ballet Theater also had the first ballet performed in Dushanbe in 1941, entitled Two Roses, and the ballet troupe gradually grew over time. The troupe was improved with graduates from the Leningrad Choreographic School with ballet dancers such as Malika Sabirova. The theater was refitted in 2009 and continues operating to this day.\nThe 1920s saw the birth of drama in the city. The first, Lahouti theater, was built in 1929. In the 1930s, Soviet themes like class struggle, fighting against the past, and gender equality were prominent in plays. In 1935, the Tajik Musical Theater, now the Ayni theater, was built. A comedy troupe was created in 1944 and after the war young artists influenced plays in Dushanbe, influencing the creation of the Tajik State Youth Theater.\nContinuing with a nationalist tradition, Tajik classics were made into plays. During World War 2, plays were focused on the war and historical themes from the 1950s onward. In the 70s and 80s foreign plays, like Oedipus Rex, were introduced to Dushanbe. After independence, plays focused primarily on the devastating civil war. Today, some theaters are the Tajik Academic Opera and Ballet Theater, the State Russian Drama Theater, the youth theater, the State Experimental Theater, and the republican puppet theater.\nThe Mayakovsky Theatre was Tajikistan's oldest theatre and last surviving Russian-language theatre company; it was demolished in 2016 as part of the government's wholesale destruction of numerous 20th-century buildings of historical and architectural interest.\nLiterature.\nThe first printing press in Tajikistan was created in August 1924, the Tajik State Publishing House, the Donish Publishing House was founded in 1944. In 1925 4 books were printed, which grew to 13 in 1926. In 1930, Sadriddin Ayni wrote the first Tajik novel, Dokhunda. Publishing houses established in 1934 and the Academy of Sciences of Tajikistan publishing house dramatically increased book production in the city. The Maorif Publishing House was created in 1975. In 2004, there were 30 publishing companies in the city.\nDushanbe became the center of Tajik literature in the 1920s with figures such as Sadriddin Ayni, Abolqasem Lahouti, and Payrav Sulaymoni along with new Soviet literature calling for revolution and social equality and Tajik nationalist literature. Children's books and translated works also had their beginnings in this period. In the 1930s, young Russian writers influenced the literature of the city, part of the \"Komsomol generation.\" The themes often touched on the rapid development of Dushanbe during the 30s.\nDuring World War 2, literature shifted towards patriotic and militaristic themes of protecting the motherland in shorter formats than novels. Messages from the frontlines and satires became popular. Russian literature also became known, partially due to the movement of factories and people from the frontlines of the war to the east. After the war, prose works and poetry, with poets like Mirzo Tursunzoda, became more popular along with the continuation of genres from previous decades. Literary criticism developed along with analysis of individual writers.\nFrom the 1950s, the historical revolutionary genre developed, prompting authors to use history for inspiration. In the 60s the new genre of science fiction began in the city with writers like Mirsaid Mirshakar. In the 70s and 80s the themes of disorder gained more prominence, not coincidentally soon before the Soviet Union's collapse. In poetry, civic and philosophical lyrical themes were most popular. After independence, previously forbidden subjects like religion started to appear in literature, along with reflections on the civil war and a more international scene has developed in the city.\nVisual arts.\nSculpture was first introduced to Dushanbe in the 1920s and throughout the Soviet period was focused on combining modern culture and a classical heritage. Modern sculpture mainly has historical subjects like Firdavsi, Shah Anushirvan, or Ismail Samani, often to commemorate Tajik nationhood and ethnicity by looking to past Achaemenid and Samanid figures.Painting in Dushanbe took off when Russian painters moved to this city in the 20s and 30s. By the 50s, Tajik artists started to paint. In the 1960s, the severe style grew and in the 70s and 80s a focus on Tajik heritage and nationalism was predominant. In the late 80s, however, painting shifted from a focus on historical figures to emotional depth and personality. During the civil war, a theme of conflict in painting developed. Sabzali Sharipov's black and white series, for example, was devoted to the civil war.\nFilm.\nCinema in Dushanbe started in the 1930s with the creation of film studios and cinemas by the Soviet government, although the first cinema was created in 1927 where residents watched Nibelung by Frits Lang. Komil Yarmatov was the first prominent Tajik film director. Documentaries were also popular in this period, and the first feature film appeared in 1938. In World War 2, feature film production in Dushanbe was suspended due to lack of supplies. After the war, more feature films were developed, with many movies attempting to create a portrait of the city. In the 1980s a new generation of filmmakers brought new values such a pluralism into the theater, which led to some films focusing on the truth of Soviet history. During the civil war, the landscape changed dramatically. Tajikfilm, which formerly had a monopoly on filmmaking, had to shut down, while independent filmmakers chronicled the horrors of the civil war.\nSports.\nGymnastics, equestrian sports and athletics were practiced in 1923 at the Dushanbe sports club and in 1929 tennis was introduced. The All-Tajik Spartakiad was first held in 1934, and in 1939 Dynamo Dushanbe won the quarterfinals of the Cup of the USSR. In 1950 the country's soccer team took first place in the Central Asian Games.\nIn 2003, Dushanbe hosted the Central Asian Games. The most popular sports in Dushanbe are sambo, wrestling, judo, karate, taekwondo, artistic gymnastics, weightlifting, archery, shooting, boxing, football, basketball, diving, tennis, chess, Buzkashi, and checkers. Four soccer teams of the Tajikistan Higher League play in Dushanbe: CSKA Pamir, Dushanbe-83, Istiklol, and Lokomotiv-Pamir. The Pamir Stadium in Dushanbe was constructed in 1939 where CSKA Pamir Dushanbe played. Dushanbe Stadium is currently being constructed and will seat 30,000 when completed.\nMedia.\nNewspapers and magazines.\nThe first newspaper published in Tajik was \"Bukhara Sharif\" in Kagan on 11 March 1912 and published by leaders of the Jadid movement like Mirzo Jalol Yusufzoda. The purpose of the newspaper was to \"be a scientific, literary, directional, subject, and economic publication that will strive for the spread of civilization and the idea.\" Soon after, however, Ivan Petrov requested that the Emir of Bukhara close the paper, which he did on 2 January 1913.\nOina and Mullo Nasreddin were two of the earliest Tajik language magazines. The \"Zvezda Vostok\" magazine was published in Tajik in the early 1920s in support of the October Revolution. The first Soviet newspaper distributed in Tajikistan was \"Shulai Inkilob\" (Flame of the Revolution) as propaganda for the Soviet government in 1919. It was distributed throughout Tajikistan and was the main Tajik language newspaper that opposed the previous Emirate and was clearly in support of communism, the October Revolution, and the Bukharan Communist Party.\nThe first Soviet newspaper published in Tajikistan was ' which detailed the conditions of the Red Army in Tajikistan in 1923 during the Basmachi movement. In 1924, the newspaper \"Voice of the East\" ( or ), the first Soviet government newspaper was published in Dushanbe and was a forum for much of the poetry and literature of the young republic. In 1925, the official newspaper of Soviet Tajikistan was \"'\" (Awakening of the Tajiks). An Uzbek-language paper, Red Tajikistan, was published in Tajikistan as well. Sadriddin Ayni also published many newspapers such as \"Bukhara News\", \"Horpustak\", and \"Flame of the Revolution\".\nIn 1929, the newspaper Red Tajikistan came into print with a large daily circulation of 5000. In the 1930s \"Komsomolets Tadzhikistana\" was published as a communist paper intended for the youth of Tajikistan. Many other newspapers were published during this time as well. The press often emphasized the collective farming system and the newspaper \"Dehkoni Kambagal\" was popular among farmers.\nDuring World War 2 newspaper production was strained as raw materials became increasingly scarce and their numbers were reduced. After the war, the many newspapers from the 30s began to be produced once again. In the 60s and 70s the newspaper \"Communist of Tajikistan\" gained prominence, winning the Order of the Red Banner of Labor. International cooperation was to be emphasized during the time period.\nDuring perestroika, newspapers embraced more liberal and democratic ideas. One of the first to do this was the Komsomol of Tajikistan. Farkhang, a new literary magazine, published national Tajik and Islamic literature banned before such as the \"Masnavi\". The \"Sukhan\" newspaper, published by the Union of Journalists of Tajikistan, was a leading voice for liberalism and perestroika in the republic, writing about topics such as freedom of speech, democratization, and the opposition. The first publication not released by the state was from Rastokhez, printed in Lithuania and delivered to Dushanbe. The Democratic Party of Tajikistan published a paper, \"Justice\", in Dushanbe as well which had a circulation of 25000. \"Charogi Ruz\", or Light of Day, was the first private publication in Dushanbe, and advertised itself as the free tribune for youth. Free publications such as \"Oinai zindagi\" (by trade unions), \"Somon\", \"Haftgandzh\", and others formed. Today, \"Charogi Ruz\" is known for its criticism of the ruling government.\nIn August 1999 there were officially 199 newspapers, although only 17 of those appeared regularly. Some of the most widely circulated national government publications are \"Dzhumhuriet\" and \"Narodna Gazeta\". In addition to the state news agency \"Khovar\" (News), there are several private newspapers, including Asia-Plus, which regularly publishes in Russian and English and reports on political, social and economic issues, \"Jumhuriyat,\" and \"Khalk ovozi.\" In 2019 there were 37 regular newspapers and 37 magazines published in the city.\nRadio.\nIn 1924 a radio station was built in Dushanbe for military communication. On 10 April 1930 the first radio broadcast was heard by civilians in Tajikistan, from Moscow. It functioned as a news source and a source of Soviet propaganda. The first station, in Dushanbe, mainly focused on retransmitted broadcasts from Moscow and radios gradually became more prevalent in the country. While development slowed during World War 2, afterwards Tajikistan received higher broadband and quality radio stations and broadcasts.\nIn 1977, locally created radio broadcasts were able to be transmitted from Dushanbe thanks to the construction of the Radio House in the city. In 2000, the Sadoi Dushanbe Radio was created, and today that is one of the four programs broadcast in Dushanbe.\nAs of August 1999 government radio is broadcast throughout the nation along with independent outlets such as Asia Plus radio. Radio Liberty, the BBC, and Sadoi Khuroson are also broadcast in Tajik, although no independent radio stations were in operation.\nTelevision.\nOn 7 November 1959 the first television center was created in the republic, the Tajik Television Studio. In 1967 programs from Moscow and Tashkent were broadcast in the country and on 15 November 1975 color television was introduced. As of August 1999 12 to 15 stations broadcast consistently. Many Russian language channels like ORT, RTR, and TV-6 broadcast as well. Today, a greater number of private television stations operate in the city, with 15 in the whole country, although there are still 7 state owned channels.\nNotable people.\n \nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nDushanbe is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 1982, Mary Hey and Sophia Stoller started an initiative to make Dushanbe a sister city of Boulder even though during that time they were on opposite sides of the Cold War. In 1987, the mayor of Dushanbe, Maksud Ikramov, officially made Boulder a sister city of Dushanbe. Exchange students, tourism, and art exchanges began between the two cities. The Tajik Teahouse was sent from Dushanbe to Boulder in 1990. During the civil war, Boulder sent humanitarian aid to Dushanbe.\nInternational conferences.\nMany international conferences have been held in Dushanbe, such as the International Conference on Integrated TB Control in Central Asia and the hosting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization conference in 2000, 2008, and 2014.\nIn 2003, Dushanbe hosted the International Forum on Fresh Water which was attended by 50 states and organizations.\nFrom 20 to 23 June 2018 the High-Level International Conference on the International Decade for Action 'Water for Sustainable Development' was held in Dushanbe, which discussed the upcoming decade for action with regards to water. A second conference on the same subject was planned to be held in June 2020.\nOn 16\u201317 May 2019 a high-level conference entitled \"Countering Terrorism and its Financing Through Illicit Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime\" was held in Dushanbe and attended by more than 50 countries. It passed the Dushanbe declaration, which put the primary responsibility for fighting terrorism onto national governments. Other topics, such as drug smuggling, were also discussed.\nOn 15 June 2019 the fifth summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia was held in Dushanbe. The Asian members of the organization discussed common interests on topics such as peace and security, terrorism, arms control, the Iran nuclear deal, poverty, economic development, and globalization.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This article discusses the variety of ways in which English plurals are formed from the corresponding singular forms, as well as various issues concerning the usage of singulars and plurals in English. For plurals of pronouns, see English personal pronouns.\nPhonological transcriptions provided in this article are for Received Pronunciation and General American. For more information, see English phonology.\nMeaning.\nAlthough the everyday meaning of \"plural\" is \"more than one\", the grammatical term has a slightly different technical meaning. In the English system of grammatical number, singular means \"one (or minus one)\", and plural means \"not singular\". In other words, plural means not just \"more than one\" but also \"less than one (except minus one)\". This less-than aspect can be seen in cases like \"the temperature is zero degrees\" (not *\"zero degree\") and \"0.5 children per woman\" (not *\"0.5 child per woman\").\nForm.\nRegular plurals.\nThe plural morpheme in English is a sibilant suffixed to the end of most nouns. Regular English plurals fall into three classes, depending upon the sound that ends the singular form:\nAny sibilant.\nIn English, there are six sibilant consonants: , , , , , and . When a singular noun ends in one of these sounds, its plural is spoken by appending or (in some transcription systems, this is abbreviated as ). The spelling adds \"-es\", or \"-s\" if the singular already ends in \"-e\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther voiceless consonants.\nIn most English varieties, there are five non-sibilant voiceless consonants that occur at the end of words: , , , , and ; some varieties also have . When the singular form ends in a voiceless consonant other than a sibilant, the plural is normally formed by adding (a voiceless sibilant). The spelling adds \"-s\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSome that end in or , however, are \"near-regular\". See section below.\nOther voiced phonemes.\nFor a singular noun ending on a non-sibilant voiced consonant, the plural adds (a voiced sibilant) and the spelling adds \"-s\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn English, all vowels are voiced. Nouns ending in a vowel sound similarly add to form the plural. The spelling usually adds \"-s\", but certain instances (detailed below) may add \"-es\" instead:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPlurals of nouns in \"-o\" preceded by a consonant.\nSingular nouns ending in \"o\" preceded by a consonant in many cases spell the plural by adding \"-es\" (pronounced ):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHowever, many nouns of foreign origin, including almost all Italian loanwords, add only \"-s\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPlurals of nouns in \"-y\".\nNouns ending in a vocalic \"y\" (that is, used as a vowel) preceded by a consonant usually drop the \"y\" and add \"-ies\" (pronounced , or in words where the y is pronounced ):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWords ending in \"quy\" also follow this pattern, since in English \"qu\" is a digraph for two consonant sounds () or sometimes one ():\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHowever, proper nouns (particularly names of people) of this type usually form their plurals by simply adding \"-s\": \"the two Kennedys\", \"there are three Harrys in our office\". With place names this rule is not always adhered to: \"Sicilies\" and \"Scillies\" are the standard plurals of \"Sicily\" and \"Scilly\", while \"Germanys\" and \"Germanies\" are both used.\"\" Nor does the rule apply to words that are merely capitalized common nouns: \"P&amp;O Ferries\" (from \"ferry\").\nOther exceptions include \"lay-bys\" and \"stand-bys\".\nWords ending in a \"y\" preceded by a vowel form their plurals by adding \"-s\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHowever, the plural form (rarely used) of \"money\" is usually \"monies\", although \"moneys\" is also found. Also, the plural of \"trolley\" can be either \"trolleys\" or \"trollies\", although the former is more common.\nPlurals of nouns in \"-i\".\nNouns written with \"-i\" usually have plurals in \"-is\" but some in \"-ies\" are also found.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNear-regular plurals.\nIn Old and Middle English, voiceless fricatives and mutated to voiced fricatives /v/ and /\u00f0/ respectively before a voiced ending. In some words this voicing survives in the modern English plural. In the case of changing to , the mutation is indicated in the orthography as well; also, a silent \"e\" is added in this case if the singular does not already end with \"-e\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn addition, there is one word where is voiced in the plural:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMany nouns ending in or (including all words where is represented orthographically by gh or ph) nevertheless retain the voiceless consonant:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSome can do either:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIrregular plurals.\nThere are many other less regular ways of forming plurals, usually stemming from older forms of English or from foreign borrowings.\nNouns with identical singular and plural.\nSome nouns have identical singular and plural (zero inflection). Many of these are the names of animals:\nAs a general rule, game or other animals are often referred to in the singular for the plural in a sporting context: \"He shot six brace of pheasant\", \"Carruthers bagged a dozen tiger last year\", whereas in another context such as zoology or tourism the regular plural would be used. Eric Partridge refers to these sporting terms as \"snob plurals\" and conjectures that they may have developed by analogy with the common English irregular plural animal words \"deer\", \"sheep\" and \"trout\". Similarly, nearly all kinds of fish have no separate plural form (though there are exceptions\u2014such as rays, sharks or lampreys). As to the word \"fish\" itself, the plural is usually identical to the singular, although \"fishes\" is sometimes used, especially when meaning \"species of fish\". \"Fishes\" is also used in iconic contexts, such as the Bible story of the loaves and fishes, or the reference in \"The Godfather\", \"Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.\" The plurals of the names of fishes either take the ending -s or is the same as the singular.\nOther nouns that have identical singular and plural forms include:\nMany names for Native American peoples are not inflected in the plural:\nExceptions include \"Algonquins\", \"Apaches\", \"Aztecs\", \"Chippewas\", \"Hurons\", \"Incas\", \"Mohawks\", \"Oneidas\", and \"Seminoles\".\nEnglish sometimes distinguishes between regular plural forms of demonyms/ethnonyms (e.g. \"five Dutchmen\", \"several Irishmen\"), and uncountable plurals used to refer to entire nationalities collectively (e.g. \"the Dutch\", \"the Irish\").\nCertain other words borrowed from foreign languages such as Japanese and M\u0101ori are \"correctly\" not inflected in the plural, although many people are not aware of this rule; see below.\nPlurals in \"-(e)n\".\nThe plurals of a few nouns are formed from the singular by adding \"-n\" or \"-en\", stemming from the Old English weak declension. Only the following three are commonly found:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs noted, the word \"children\" comes from an earlier form \"childer\". There were formerly a few other words like this: eyre/eyren (eggs), lamber/lambren (lambs), and calver/calveren (calves).\nAn interesting example may be found embedded in the name of the London parish of Clerkenwell, which derives its name from being the Clerks' Well associated with the Clerkenwell Priory of the Knights Hospitaller.\nThe following \"-(e)n\" plurals are found in dialectal, rare, or archaic usage:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe word \"box\", referring to a computer, is sometimes pluralized humorously to \"boxen\" in hacker subculture, by analogy to \"oxen\". In the same context, multiple VAX computers are sometimes called \"Vaxen,\" particularly if operating as a cluster. Multiple Unix systems are sometimes referred to as \"Unix boxen,\" or may be called \"Unices\" along the Latin model.\nApophonic plurals.\nThe plural is sometimes formed by changing the vowel sound of the singular (these are sometimes called \"mutated plurals\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThis group consists of words that historically belong to the Old English consonant declension, see . There are many compounds of \"man\" and \"woman\" that form their plurals in the same way: \"postmen\", \"policewomen\", etc.\nThe plural of \"mongoose\" is \"mongooses\" or sometimes \"mongeese\". \"Mongeese\" is a back-formation by analogy to \"goose\" / \"geese\" and is often used in a jocular context. The form \"meese\" is sometimes also used humorously as the plural of \"moose\"\u2014normally \"moose\" or \"mooses\"\u2014or even of \"mouse\".\nMiscellaneous irregular plurals.\nSome words have irregular plurals that do not fit any of the types given here.\nIrregular plurals from foreign languages.\nIrregular plurals from Latin and Greek.\nEnglish has borrowed a great many words from Classical Latin and Classical Greek. Classical Latin has a very complex system of endings in which there are five categories or declensions of nouns, adjectives, and pronouns (some with sub-categories). Usually, in borrowing words from Latin, the endings of the nominative are used: nouns whose nominative singular ends in \"-a\" (first declension) have plurals in \"-ae\" (\"anima\", \"animae\"); nouns whose nominative singular ends in \"-um\" (second declension neuter) have plurals in \"-a\" (\"stadium\", \"stadia\"; \"datum\", \"data\"). (For a full treatment, see Latin declensions.)\nClassical Greek has a simpler system, but still more complicated than that of English. Most loan words from Greek in English are from Attic Greek (the Athenian Greek of Plato, Aristotle, and other great writers), not Demotic Greek, Koine (Biblical) Greek, or Modern Greek. This is because Attic Greek is what is taught in classes in Greek in Western Europe, and therefore was the Greek that the word borrowers knew.\nAnglicisation.\nThe general trend with loanwords is toward what is called \"Anglicisation\" or \"naturalisation\", that is, the re-formation of the word and its inflections as normal English words. Many nouns have settled on, or acquired a modern form from the original (usually Latin). Other nouns have become Anglicised, taking on the normal \"s\" ending. In some cases, both forms are still competing.\nThe choice of a form can often depend on context: for a scholar, the plural of \"appendix\" is \"appendices\" (following the original language); for some physicians, the plural of \"appendix\" is \"appendixes\". Likewise, a radio or radar engineer works with \"antennas\", but an entomologist deals with \"antennae\". The choice of form can also depend on the level of discourse: traditional Latin plurals are found more often in academic and scientific contexts, whereas in daily speech the Anglicised forms are more common. In the following table, the Latin plurals are listed, together with the Anglicised forms when these are more common.\nDifferent paradigms of Latin pronunciation can lead to confusion as to the number or gender of the noun in question. As traditionally used in English, including scientific, medical, and legal contexts, Latin nouns retain the classical inflection with regard to spelling; however, those inflections use an Anglicised pronunciation: the entomologist pronounces \"antennae\" as . This may cause confusion for those familiar with the Classical Latin pronunciation . The words \"alumni\" (masculine plural) and \"alumnae\" (feminine plural) are notorious in this regard, as \"alumni\" in Anglicised pronunciation sounds the same as \"alumnae\" in Classical Latin pronunciation, and vice versa.\nBecause many of these plurals do not end in \"-s\", some of them have been reinterpreted as singular forms: particularly the words \"datum\" and \"medium\" (as in a \"medium of communication\"), where the original plurals \"data\" and \"media\" are now, in many contexts, used by some as singular mass nouns: \"The media is biased\"; \"This data shows us that\u00a0...\" (although a number of scientists, especially of British origin, still say \"These data show us that\u00a0...\"). See below for more information. Similarly, words such as \"criteria\" and \"phenomena\" are used as singular by some speakers, although this is still considered incorrect in standard usage (see below).\nFinal \"-a\" becomes \"-ae\" (also \"-\u00e6\"), or just adds \"-s\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nScientific abbreviations for words of Latin origin ending in \"-a\", such as \"SN\" for \"supernova\", can form a plural by adding \"-e\", as \"SNe\" for \"supernovae\".\nFinal \"-ex\" or \"-ix\" becomes \"-ices\" (pronounced ), or just adds \"-es\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFinal \"-is\" becomes \"-es\" (pronounced ) or \"-ises/-ides\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExcept for words derived from Greek , which become (pronounced or ):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\n(Some of these are Greek rather than Latin words, but the method of plural formation in English is the same.) Some people treat \"process\" as if it belonged to this class, pronouncing \"processes\" instead of standard . Since the word comes from Latin , whose plural in the fourth declension is with a long \"u\", this pronunciation is by analogy, not etymology. \"Axes\" , the plural of \"axis\", is pronounced differently from \"axes\" , the plural of \"ax(e)\".\nFinal \"-ies\" remains unchanged:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\n\"Specie\" for a singular of \"species\" is considered nonstandard. It is standard meaning the form of money, where it derives from the Latin singular ablative in the phrase \"in specie\".\nFinal \"-um\" becomes \"-a\", or just adds \"-s\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFinal \"-us\" becomes \"-i\" (second declension, ) or \"-era\" or \"-ora\" (third declension), or just adds \"-es\" (especially for fourth declension words, where the Latin plural was similar to the singular):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFinal \"-us\" remains unchanged in the plural (fourth declension\u2014the plural has a long \u016b to differentiate it from the singular short u):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nColloquial usages based in a humorous fashion on the second declension include \"Elvii\" (better Latin would be \"Elv\u0113s\" or Elvid\u0113s) to refer to multiple Elvis impersonators, and \"Loti\", used by petrolheads to refer to Lotus automobiles in the plural.\nSome Greek plurals are preserved in English (\"cf.\" Plurals of words of Greek origin):\nFinal \"-on\" becomes \"-a\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFinal \"-as\" in one case changes to \"-antes\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFinal \"-ma\" in nouns of Greek origin can become \"-mata\", although \"-s\" is usually also acceptable, and in many cases more common.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSuch \"-ata\" plurals also occur in Latin words borrowed from Greek, e.g. \"poemata\". The \"a\" is short in both languages.\nIrregular plurals from other languages.\nSome nouns of French origin add an \"-x\", which may be silent or pronounced :\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also below.\nItalian nouns, notably technical terms in music and art, often retain the Italian plurals:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nForeign terms may take native plural forms, especially when the user is addressing an audience familiar with the language. In such cases, the conventionally formed English plural may sound awkward or be confusing.\nNouns of Slavic origin add \"-a\" or \"-i\" according to native rules, or just \"-s\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNouns of Hebrew origin add \"-im\" or \"-ot\" (generally m/f) according to native rules, or just \"-s\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\n\"-ot\" is pronounced \"os\" (with unvoiced \"s\") in the Ashkenazi dialect.\nMany nouns of Japanese origin have no plural form and do not change:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther nouns such as \"kimonos\", \"ninjas\", \"futons\", and \"tsunamis\" are more often seen with a regular English plural.\nIn New Zealand English, nouns of M\u0101ori origin can either take an \"-s\" or have no separate plural form. Words more connected to M\u0101ori culture and used in that context tend to retain the same form, while names of flora and fauna may or may not take an \"-s\", depending on context. Many regard omission as more correct:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSome words borrowed from Inuktitut and related languages spoken by the Inuit in Canada, Greenland and Alaska, retain the original plurals. The word \"Inuit\" itself is the plural form. Canadian English also borrows Inuktitut singular \"Inuk\", which is uncommon in English outside Canada.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNouns from languages other than the above generally form plurals as if they were native English words:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPlurals of compound nouns.\nThe majority of English compound nouns have one basic term, or head, with which they end. These are nouns and are pluralized in typical fashion:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSome compounds have one head with which they begin. These heads are also nouns and the head usually pluralizes, leaving the second, usually a post-positive adjective, term unchanged:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIt is common in informal speech to pluralize the last word instead, like most English nouns, but in edited prose aimed at educated people, the forms given above are usually preferred.\nIf a compound can be thought to have two heads, both of them tend to be pluralized when the first head has an irregular plural form:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTwo-headed compounds in which the first head has a standard plural form, however, tend to pluralize only the final head:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn military and naval usage, the terms \"general\", \"colonel\", and \"commander\", as part of an officer's title, are etymologically adjectives, but they have been adopted as nouns and are thus heads, so compound titles employing them are pluralized at the end:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFor compounds of three or more words that have a head (or a term functioning as a head) with an irregular plural form, only that term is pluralized:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFor many other compounds of three or more words with a head at the front\u2014especially in cases where the compound is \"ad hoc\" or the head is metaphorical\u2014it is generally regarded as acceptable to pluralize either the first major term or the last (if open when singular, such compounds tend to take hyphens when plural in the latter case):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWith a few extended compounds, both terms may be pluralized\u2014again, with an alternative (which may be more prevalent, e.g. \"heads of state\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn some extended compounds constructed around \"o\", only the last term is pluralized (or left unchanged if it is already plural):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also the Headless nouns section below.\nFrench compounds.\nMany English compounds have been borrowed directly from French, and these generally follow a somewhat different set of rules. In French loaned compounds with a noun as head and a qualifying adjective, it is correct to pluralize both words, in common with French practice. Usually in French, the noun precedes the adjective:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn some expressions, the adjective precedes the noun, in which case it is still correct to pluralize both words, in common with French practice, although in the English form sometimes only the noun is pluralized:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHowever, if the adjectives \"beau\" \"beautiful/handsome\", \"nouveau\" \"new\", or \"vieux\" \"old\" precede a singular noun beginning with a vowel or a mute \"h\" (such as \"homme\"), they are changed to \"bel\" (as in the example below), \"nouvel\", or \"vieil\" (to facilitate pronunciation in French). In these cases, both the noun and the adjective are pluralized in the English form as in French:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn other French compound expressions, only the head noun is pluralized:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\n\"but\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPlurals of letters and abbreviations.\nThe plural of individual letters is usually written with \"-'s\": \"there are two a's in this sentence\"; \"mind your p's and q's\"; \"dot the i's and cross the t's\".\nSome people extend this use of the apostrophe to other cases, such as plurals of numbers written in figures (e.g. \"1990's\"), words used as terms (e.g. \"his writing uses a lot of \"but's\"\"). However, others prefer to avoid this method (which can lead to confusion with the possessive \"-'s\"), and write \"1990s\", \"buts\"; this is the style recommended by \"The Chicago Manual of Style\".\nLikewise, acronyms and initialisms are normally pluralized simply by adding (lowercase) \"-s\", as in \"MPs\", although the apostrophe is sometimes seen. Use of the apostrophe is more common in those cases where the letters are followed by periods (\"B.A.'s\"), or where the last letter is S (as in \"PS's\" and \"CAS's\", although \"PSs\" and \"CASs\" are also acceptable; the ending \"-es\" is also sometimes seen).\nEnglish (like Latin and certain other European languages) can form a plural of certain one-letter abbreviations by doubling the letter: p. (\"page\"), pp. (\"pages\"). Other examples include ll. (\"lines\"), ff. (\"following lines/pages\"), hh. (\"hands\", as a measure), PP. (\"Popes\"), SS. (\"Saints\"), ss. (or \u00a7\u00a7) (\"sections\"), vv. (\"volumes\"). Some multi-letter abbreviations can be treated the same way, by doubling the final letter: MS (\"manuscript\"), MSS (\"manuscripts\"); op. (\"opus\"), opp. (\"opera\" as plural of opus).\nHowever, often the abbreviation used for the singular is used also as the abbreviation for the plural; this is normal for most units of measurement and currency. The SI unit symbols are officially not considered abbreviations and not pluralized, as in 10\u00a0m (\"10 metres\").\nHeadless nouns.\nIn \"The Language Instinct\", linguist Steven Pinker discusses what he calls \"headless words\", typically bahuvrihi compounds, such as \"lowlife\" and \"flatfoot\", in which \"life\" and \"foot\" are not heads semantically; that is, a lowlife is not a type of life, and a flatfoot is not a type of foot. When the common form of such a word is singular, it is treated as if it has a regular plural, even if the final constituent of the word is usually pluralized in an irregular fashion. Thus the plural of \"lowlife\" is \"lowlifes\", not \"lowlives\", according to Pinker. Other proposed examples include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAn exception is \"Blackfoot\", of which the plural can be \"Blackfeet\", though that form of the name is officially rejected by the Blackfoot First Nations of Canada.\nAnother analogous case is that of sport team names such as the Miami Marlins and Toronto Maple Leafs. For these, see below.\nDefective nouns.\nPlurals without singulars.\nSome nouns have no singular form. Such a noun is called a . Examples include \"cattle\", \"thanks\", \"clothes\" (originally a plural of \"cloth\").\nA particular set of nouns, describing things having two parts, comprises the major group of in modern English:\nThese words are interchangeable with \"a pair of scissors\", \"a pair of trousers\", and so forth. In the American fashion industry it is common to refer to a single pair of pants as a \"pant\"\u2014though this is a back-formation, the English word (deriving from the French ) was originally singular. In the same field, one half of a pair of scissors separated from the other half is, rather illogically, referred to as a \"half-scissor\". \"Tweezers\" used to be part of this group, but \"tweezer\" has come into common usage since the second half of the 20th century.\nNouns describing things having two parts are expressed in the singular when used as adjectives. Other \"\" remain unchanged as adjectives.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThere are also some plural nouns whose singular forms exist, though they are much more rarely encountered than the plurals:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSingulars without plurals.\nMass nouns (or uncountable nouns) do not represent distinct objects, so the singular and plural semantics do not apply in the same way. Some examples:\nNotes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSome mass nouns can be pluralized, but the meaning in this case may change somewhat. For example, when someone has two \"grains of sand\", they do not have \"two sands\", but \"sand\". However, there could be the many \"sands of Africa\": either many distinct stretches of sand, or distinct types of sand of interest to geologists or builders, or simply the allusive \"The Sands of Mars\".\nIt is rare to pluralize \"furniture\" in this way (though it was formerly more common) and \"information\" is never pluralized.\nThere are several isotopes of oxygen, which might be referred to as different oxygens. In casual speech, \"oxygen\" might be used as shorthand for \"an oxygen atom\", but in this case, it is not a mass noun, so one can refer to \"multiple oxygens in the same molecule\".\nOne would interpret \"Bob's \"wisdoms\"\" as \"various pieces of Bob's wisdom\" (that is, \"don't run with scissors\", \"defer to those with greater knowledge\"), \"deceits\" as a series of instances of deceitful behaviour (lied on income tax, dated my wife), and the different \"idlenesses\" of the worker as plural distinct manifestations of the mass concept of idleness (or as different types of idleness, \"bone lazy\" versus \"no work to do\").\nThe pair \"specie\" and \"species\" both come from a Latin word meaning \"kind\", but they do not form a singular-plural pair. In Latin, \"specie\" is the ablative singular form, while \"species\" is the nominative form, which happens to be the same in both singular and plural. In English, \"species\" behaves similarly\u2014as a noun with identical singular and plural\u2014while \"specie\" is treated as a mass noun, referring to money in the form of coins (the idea is of \"[payment] in kind\").\nSingulars as plural and plurals as singular.\nPlural words becoming singular.\nPlural in form but singular in construction.\nCertain words which were originally plural in form have come to be used almost exclusively as singulars (usually uncountable); for example \"billiards\", \"measles\", \"news\", \"mathematics\", \"physics\", etc. Some of these words, such as \"news\", are strongly and consistently felt as singular by fluent speakers. These words are usually marked in dictionaries with the phrase \"plural in form but singular in construction\" (or similar wording). Others, such as \"aesthetics\", are less strongly or consistently felt as singular; for the latter type, the dictionary phrase \"plural in form but singular or plural in construction\" recognizes variable usage.\nPlural form became a singular form.\nSome words of foreign origin are much better known in their (foreign-morphology) plural form, and are often not even recognized by English speakers as having plural form; descriptively, in English morphology many of these simply are not in plural form, because English has naturalized the foreign plural as the English singular. Usage of the original singular may be considered pedantic, hypercorrective, or incorrect. In the examples below, the original plural is now commonly used as a singular, and in some cases a regular English plural (effectively a double plural) has been formed from it.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\n\"Magazine\" was derived from Arabic via French. It was originally plural, but in French and English it is always regarded as singular.\nOther words whose plurals are sometimes used as singulars include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBack-formation.\nSome words have unusually formed singulars and plurals, but develop \"normal\" singular-plural pairs by back-formation. For example, \"pease\" (modern \"peas\") was in origin a singular with plural \"peasen\". However, \"pease\" came to be analysed as plural by analogy, from which a new singular \"pea\" was formed; the spelling of \"pease\" was also altered accordingly, surviving only in the name of the dish \"pease porridge\" or \"pease pudding\". Similarly, \"termites\" was the three-syllable plural of \"termes\"; this singular was lost, however, and the plural form reduced to two syllables. \"Syringe\" is a back-formation from \"syringes\", itself the plural of \"syrinx\", a musical instrument. \"Cherry\" is from Norman French \"cherise\". \"Phases\" was once the plural of \"phasis\", but the singular is now \"phase\". The nonstandard, offensive, and now obsolete \"Chinee\" and \"Portugee\" singulars are back-formations from the standard \"Chinese\" and \"Portuguese\".\n\"Kudos\" is a singular Greek word meaning praise, but is often taken to be a plural. At present, however, \"kudo\" is considered an error, though the usage is becoming more common as \"kudos\" becomes better known. The name of the Greek sandwich style \"gyros\" is increasingly undergoing a similar transformation.\nThe term, from Latin, for the main upper arm flexor in the singular is the \"biceps muscle\" (from \"biceps brachii\"); however, many English speakers take it to be a plural and refer to the muscle of only one arm, by back-formation, as \"a bicep\". The correct\u2014although very seldom used\u2014Latin plural is \"bicipites\".\nThe word \"sastrugi\" (hard ridges on deep snow) is of Russian origin and its singular is \"sastruga\"; but the imagined Latin-type singular \"sastrugus\" has sometimes been used.\nGeographical plurals used as singular.\nGeographical names may be treated as singular even if they are plural in form, if they are regarded as representing a single entity such as a country: \"The United States is a country in North America\" (similarly with \"the Netherlands\", \"the Philippines\", \"Trinidad and Tobago\", \"the United Nations,\" etc.). However, if the sense is a group of geographical objects, such as islands or mountains, a plural-form name will be treated as plural: \"The Hebrides are a group of islands off the coast of Scotland.\"\nSingulars with collective meaning treated as plural.\nWords such as \"army\", \"company\", \"crowd\", \"family\", \"fleet\", \"government\", \"majority\", \"mess\", \"number\", \"pack\", \"party\" and \"team\" may refer either to a single entity or the members of the set composing it. If the latter meaning is intended, the word (though singular in form) may be treated as if it were a plural, in that it may take a plural verb and be replaced with a plural pronoun: (in British English) \"the government are considering their position\" (alternatively \"the government is considering its position\"). See synesis.\nThus, as H. W. Fowler describes, in British English they are \"treated as singular or plural at discretion\"; Fowler notes that occasionally a \"delicate distinction\" is made possible by discretionary plurals: \"\"The Cabinet\" is \"divided\" is better, because in the order of thought a whole must precede division; and \"The Cabinet\" are \"agreed\" is better, because it takes two or more to agree.\"\nPlurals of numbers.\nThe following rules apply to the plurals of numerical terms such as \"dozen\", \"score\", \"hundred\", \"thousand\", \"million\", and similar:\nDeterminers.\nThe demonstrative determiners \"this\" and \"that\" have plural forms \"these\" and \"those\", respectively.373 The cardinal numeral determiners (e.g., \"twenty people\") do not have plural forms. Apparent examples, such as \"they numbered in the twenties\" are nouns.385\nUsage and number agreement.\nNouns used attributively.\nNouns used attributively to qualify other nouns are generally in the singular, even though for example, a \"dog catcher\" catches more than one dog, and a \"department store\" has more than one department. This is true even for some binary nouns where the singular form is not found in isolation, such as a \"trouser mangle\" or the \"scissor kick\". This is also true where the attribute noun is itself qualified with a number, such as a \"twenty-dollar bill\", a \"ten-foot pole\" or a \"two-man tent\". The plural is used for nouns: a \"glasses case\" is for eyeglasses, while a \"glass case\" is made of glass (but compare \"eyeglass case\"); also an \"arms race\" versus \"arm wrestling\". The plural may be used to emphasise the plurality of the attribute, especially in British English but very rarely in American English: a \"careers advisor\", a \"languages expert\". The plural is also more common with irregular plurals for various attributions: \"women killers\" are women who kill, whereas \"woman killers\" are those who kill women.\nThe singular and plural forms of loanwords from other languages where countable nouns used attributively are, unlike English, plural and come at the end of the word are sometimes modified when entering English usage. For example, in Spanish, nouns composed of a verb and its plural object usually have the verb first and noun object last (e.g. the legendary monster \"chupacabras\", literally \"sucks-goats\", or in a more natural English formation \"goatsucker\") and the plural form of the object noun is retained in both the singular and plural forms of the compound (i.e. singular \"el chupacabras\", plural \"los chupacabras\"). However, when entering English, the final s of \"chupacabras\" was treated as a plural of the compound (i.e. the monster) rather than of the object of the verb (i.e. the goats), and so \"chupacabra\" without an s is the singular in English, even though in Spanish \"chupacabra\" could literally be construed as a creature that sucks only one single goat.\nTeams and their members.\nIn the names of sports teams, sometimes a noun will be given a regular plural in \"-s\" even though that noun in normal use has an irregular plural form (a particular case of headless nouns as described above). For example, there are teams called the Miami Marlins and the Toronto Maple Leafs, even though the word \"marlin\" normally has its plural identical to the singular and the plural of \"leaf\" is \"leaves\". (This does not always apply; for example, there is the Minnesota Lynx, not *\"Lynxes\".) Some teams use a non-standard plural spelling in their names, such as the Boston Red Sox and Chicago White Sox.\nWhen a sport team's name is plural, the corresponding singular is often used to denote a member of that team; for example a player for the Cincinnati Reds may be referred to as a \"(Cincinnati) Red\". This also applies to the St. Louis Blues ice hockey team, even though it is named after the song the \"St. Louis Blues\" and thus \"blues\" was originally a singular identical to its plural.\nWhen a team's name is plural in form but cannot be singularized by removing an \"-s\", as in \"Boston Red Sox\", the plural is sometimes used as a singular (a player may be referred to as \"a Red Sox\"). Oftentimes, the singular \"Red Sox\" will be pronounced as if it were \"Red Sock\", even though the spelling suggests otherwise.\nWhen a team's name is singular, as in \"Miami Heat\" and \"Colorado Avalanche\", the same singular word may also sometimes be used to denote a player (\"a Heat\", \"an Avalanche\"). When referring to more than one player, it is normal to use \"Heat players\" or \"Avalanche players\" (although in the latter case the team's plural-form nickname \"Avs\" is also available).\nFor the (especially British) treatment of teams as plural even if they have singular names, see above.\nAdjectives as collective plurals.\nCertain adjectives can be used, uninflected, as plurals denoting people of the designated type. For example, \"unemployed\" and \"homeless\" can be used to mean \"unemployed people\" and \"homeless people\", as in \"There are two million unemployed.\" Such usage is common with the definite article, to denote people of a certain type generally: \"the unemployed\", \"the homeless\".\nThis is common with certain nationalities: \"the British\", \"the Dutch\", \"the English\", \"the French\", \"the Irish\", \"the Spanish\", \"the Welsh\", and those where the adjective and noun singular and plural are identical anyway, including \"the Swiss\" and those in \"-ese\" (\"the Chinese\" etc.). In the case of most nationalities, however, the plural of the demonym noun is used for this purpose: \"(the) Americans\", \"(the) Poles\". Cases where the adjective formation is possible, but the noun provides a commonly used alternative, include \"the Scottish\" (or more commonly \"(the) Scots\"), \"the Danish\" (or \"(the) Danes\"), \"the Finnish\" (or \"(the) Finns\"), \"the Swedish\" (or \"(the) Swedes\").\nThe noun is normally used anyway when referring to specific sets of people (\"five Frenchmen\", \"a few Spaniards\"), although the adjective may be used especially in case of a group of mixed or unspecified sex, if the demonym nouns are gender-specific: \"there were five French\" (or \"French people\") \"in the bar\" (if neither \"Frenchmen\" or \"Frenchwomen\" would be appropriate).\nNumerical quantities.\nIn common parlance, \"plural\" simply means \"more than one\". A quantity of one may sometimes be grammatically inflected as plural.\nDecimals are always plural.\nAny quantity that includes decimal precision is plural. This includes 1 followed by any number of zeros. It is normal to say \"1.0 gallons per flush\", for instance, \"0.6 units\", or \"3.3 children per couple,\" not *\"1.0 gallon,\" *\"0.6 unit,\" or *\"3.3 child per couple.\"\nFractions.\nFractions are themselves singular or plural depending on the numerator (e.g. \"one eighth\" vs \"two eighths\"), and whatever they apply to can be singular or plural (e.g., \"three-quarters of the apple(s)\"), depending on whether it refers to a fraction of a single item or many items.\nEquivalent to zero is usually plural.\nAny zero quantity can be plural or singular, though plural is the default. So the following plurals are standard.\nHowever, if it has already been established that one item was in question, one can use \"no\" to deny that such an item exists in the singular:\nInterrogative pronouns.\nThe interrogative pronouns \"who\" and \"what\" generally take singular agreement, e.g.\nIn some cases, a plural verb can be used when the answer is expected to be plural\nWhen followed by a plural predicative complement, a plural verb must be used:\nnot\nFollowing \"which\", a singular verb suggests a singular answer, and a plural verb suggests a plural answer:\nWhen asking \"How many?\", plural is standard (e.g. \"How many bananas?\" not *\"How many banana?\"), even if the expected answer is only one.\nDeterminers.\nMany determiners are \"indifferent as to the number of the head\" noun,353 while others are selective. The following determiners select a plural head: \"both\", \"several\", \"many\", \"few\", \"a few\", \"you\", \"we\" and all cardinal numerals except \"one\". Along with these, \"a\"/\"an\" and \"another\" are compatible with quantified plurals (e.g., \"another five days\" but not \"*another days\").353\nAdjectives.\nA number of adjectives are used primarily with plural nouns. These include \"numerous\" and \"countless\",353 though singular examples like \"a numerous class\" or \"a countless multitude\" are also possible.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a major port city on the Atlantic Ocean and is located in the Western Area of the country. Freetown is Sierra Leone's major urban, economic, financial, cultural, educational and political centre, as it is the seat of the Government of Sierra Leone. The population of Freetown was 1,347,559 as of the 2024 census.\nThe city's economy revolves largely around its harbour, which occupies a part of the estuary of the Sierra Leone River in one of the world's largest natural deep water harbours.\nAlthough the city has traditionally been the homeland of the Sierra Leone Creole people, the population of Freetown is ethnically, culturally, and religiously diverse. The city is home to a significant population of all of Sierra Leone's ethnic groups, with no single ethnic group forming more than 27% of the city's population. As in virtually all parts of Sierra Leone, the Krio language of the Sierra Leone Creole people is Freetown's primary language of communication and is by far the most widely spoken language in the city.\nThe city of Freetown was founded on March 11, 1792, by 1,196 African Americans under the guidance of abolitionist Lieutenant John Clarkson at the foot of the Cotton Tree, and the city became a settlement for free and freed African American, Afro-Caribbean and Liberated African slaves. Their descendants are known as the Creole people. Before the arrival of Europeans, the local Temne and Loko people were living in villages on the land near the area that later became known as Freetown.\nFreetown is locally governed by a directly elected Freetown City Council, headed by a mayor, who also is directly elected; elections are held every four years. The mayor of Freetown is Yvonne Aki Sawyerr, who was sworn in on 11 May 2018, after her victory in the 2018 mayoral election; she was re-elected in 2022.\nThe Freetown city council has its own municipal police force.\nHistory.\nThe area around the Sierra Leone estuary has been inhabited for millennia. The earliest known group in the area was the Bullom people. In the 1540s and 50s, the Mane people invaded the area and established their own chiefdoms, integrating into the local Bullom. In January 1568, the English slave raider John Hawkins helped the Mane king Flansire destroy Bonga, headquarters of the rebellious chief Falma. Bonga was a town of around 10 000 people located in the area that would become Freetown.\nProvince of Freedom (1787\u20131789).\nThe area was settled in 1787 by 400 formerly enslaved black people sent from London, England, under the auspices of the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor, an organisation set up by the English merchant and philanthropist, Jonas Hanway, and the British abolitionist, Granville Sharp. These black people were African Americans, Afro-Caribbeans, Africans, Southeast Asians, and black people born in Great Britain. They established the 'Province of Freedom' and the settlement of Granville Town on land purchased from local Koya Temne subchief King Tom and regent Naimbana. The British understood the purchase meant that their new settlers had the land \"for ever.\" Although the established arrangement between Europeans and the Koya Temne included provisions for permanent settlement, some historians question how well the Koya leaders understood the agreement, as they had a different conception of the uses of property.\nDisputes soon broke out. King Tom's successor, King Jimmy, burnt the settlement to the ground in 1789. Alexander Falconbridge was sent to Sierra Leone in 1791 to collect the remaining Black Poor settlers, and they re-established Granville Town around the area now known as Cline Town, Sierra Leone near Fourah Bay. These 1787 settlers did not formally establish Freetown, even though the bicentennial of Freetown was celebrated in 1987; formally, Freetown was founded in 1792.\nFreetown settlement and the Colony of Sierra Leone (1792\u20131808).\nIn 1791, Thomas Peters, an African American who had served in the Black Pioneers, went to England to report the grievances of the black population in Nova Scotia. Some of these African Americans were ex-slaves who had escaped to the British forces who had been given their freedom and resettled there by the Crown after the American Revolution. Land grants and assistance in starting the settlements had been intermittent and slow.\nDuring his visit, Peters met with the directors of the Sierra Leone Company and learned of proposals for a new settlement at Sierra Leone. Despite the collapse of the 1787 colony, the directors were eager to recruit settlers to Sierra Leone. Lieutenant John Clarkson, RN, who was an abolitionist, was sent to Nova Scotia in British North America to register immigrants to take to Sierra Leone for a new settlement.\nTired of the harsh weather and racial discrimination in Nova Scotia, more than 1,100 former American slaves chose to go to Sierra Leone. They sailed in 15 ships and arrived in St. George Bay between 26 February \u2013 9 March 1792. Sixty-four settlers died en route to Sierra Leone, and Lieutenant Clarkson was among those taken ill during the voyage. Upon reaching Sierra Leone, Clarkson and some of the Nova Scotian 'captains' \"dispatched on shore to clear or make roadway for their landing\". The Nova Scotians were to build Freetown on the former site of the first Granville Town, where jungle had taken over since its destruction in 1789. Its surviving Old Settlers had relocated to Fourah Bay in 1791.\nAt Freetown, the women remained in the ships while the men worked to clear the land. Lt. Clarkson told the men to clear the land until they reached a large cotton tree (\"Ceiba pentandra\"). After the work had been done and the land cleared, all the Nova Scotians, men and women, disembarked and marched towards the thick forest and to the cotton tree, and their preachers (all African Americans) began singing \"Awake and Sing of Moses and the Lamb.\"\nIn March 1792, Nathaniel Gilbert, a white preacher, prayed and preached a sermon under the large Cotton Tree, and Reverend David George, from South Carolina, preached the first recorded Baptist service in Africa. The land was dedicated and christened 'Free Town,' as ordered by the Sierra Leone Company Directors. This was the first thanksgiving service.\nJohn Clarkson was sworn in as first governor of Sierra Leone. Small huts were erected before the rainy season. The Sierra Leone Company surveyors and the settlers built Freetown on the American grid pattern, with parallel streets and wide roads, with the largest being Water Street. On 24 August 1792, the Black Poor or Old Settlers of the second Granville Town were incorporated into the new Sierra Leone Colony, but remained at Granville Town.\nIn 1793, the settlers sent a petition to the Sierra Leone Company expressing concerns about the treatment that they were enduring. The settlers in particular objected to being issued currency that was only redeemable at a company owned store. They also claimed that the governor, a Mr. Dawes, ruled in an almost tyrannical fashion, favoring certain people over others when ruling the settlement. The writers then argued that they had not received the amount of land that Lt. Clarkson had promised them on leaving Nova Scotia. The letter expressed anxiety that the company was not treating them as freemen, but as slaves and requested that Lt. Clarkson return as governor.\nFreetown survived being pillaged by the French in 1794, and was rebuilt by the settlers. By 1798, Freetown had between 300 and 400 houses with architecture resembling that of the United States \u2013 stone foundations with wooden superstructures. Eventually this style of housing, built by the Nova Scotians, would be the model for the 'bod oses' of their Creole descendants.\nIn 1800, the Nova Scotians rebelled. The colonial authorities used the arrival of about 550 Jamaican Maroons to suppress the insurrection. Thirty-four Nova Scotians were banished and sent to either the Sherbro or a penal colony at Gore. Some of the Nova Scotians were eventually allowed back into Freetown. After the Maroons captured the Nova Scotian rebels, they were granted their land. Eventually the Maroons had their own district, which came to be known as Maroon Town.\nFreetown as a Crown Colony (1808\u20131961).\nThemne people attacked the colony in 1801 and were repulsed. The British eventually took control of Freetown, making it a Crown Colony in 1808. This act accompanied expansion that led to the creation of Sierra Leone.\nFrom 1808 to 1874, the city served as the capital of British West Africa. It also served as the base for the Royal Navy's West Africa Squadron, which was charged with enforcing the ban on the slave trade. When the squadron liberated slaves on trading ships, they brought most to Sierra Leone, and Freetown in particular; thus, the population grew to include descendants of many different peoples from all over the west coast of Africa. The British also situated three of their Mixed Commission Courts in Freetown.\nThe liberated Africans established the suburbs of Freetown Peninsula. They were the largest group of immigrants to make up the Creole people of Freetown. The city expanded rapidly. The freed slaves were joined by West Indian and African soldiers, who had fought for Britain in the Napoleonic Wars and settled here afterwards. Descendants of the freed slaves who settled in Sierra Leone between 1787 and around 1885, are called the Creoles. The Creoles play a leading role in the city, although they are a minority of the overall Sierra Leone population.\nIn the 1890s, ethnic tension flared between Lebanese residents and traders and the various native ethnicities of Sierra Leone, which led to Lebanese shops being destroyed in cities including Freetown.\nDuring World War I Freetown became a base for operations of British forces in the Atlantic. Warships came into the port to resupply and German merchant vessels captured in the region were also sent there.\nDuring World War II, Britain maintained a naval base at Freetown. The base was a staging post for Allied traffic in the South Atlantic and the assembly point for SL convoys to Britain. An RAF base was maintained at nearby Lungi airfield. British fighter aircraft which were shipped into Freetown port, were carried on the Sierra Leone Government Railway to Makeni to be assembled and flown to Egypt.\nCivil war, 1990s to early 2000s.\nThe city was the scene of fierce fighting in the late 1990s during the Sierra Leone Civil War. It was captured by ECOWAS troops seeking to restore President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah in 1998. Later it was unsuccessfully attacked by rebels of the Revolutionary United Front.\nMudslide disaster, 2017.\nIn the early morning on 14 August 2017, after much heavy rain, part of Mount Sugar Loaf on an edge of Freetown collapsed in a huge mudslide which drowned over 300 people in Regent town. Deforestation has been blamed for the landslide.\nSierra Leone fuel tanker explosion, 2021.\nOn 5 November 2021, a fuel tank truck collided with another truck in Freetown, resulting in an explosion killing at least 99 and injuring around 100.\nGeography.\nFreetown borders the Atlantic Ocean and the Western Area Rural District. Freetown municipality is politically divided into three regions: East End, Central and West End of Freetown. The wards in the East End of Freetown (East I, East II, and East III) contain the city's largest population centre and generally the poorest part of the city. The Queen Elizabeth II Quay is located within East End. The Lion Mountains sit southeast to Freetown.\nThe two central wards (Central I and Central II) make up Central Freetown, which includes Downtown Freetown and the central business district (Central II). Most of the tallest and most important national government building and foreign embassies are based in Central Freetown.\nSierra Leone's House of Parliament and the State House, the principal workplace of the president of Sierra Leone, are on Tower Hill in central Freetown. The National Stadium, the home stadium of the Sierra Leone national football team (popularly known as the Leone Stars) is in the Brookfield neighborhood.\nThe three westernmost wards (West I, West II, and West III) of the city constitute the West End of Freetown. These wards are relatively affluent. Most of the city's luxury hotels, a number of casinos, and Lumley Beach are in the west end of the city. The West End neighbourhood of Hill Station is home to the State Lodge, the official residence of the president of Sierra Leone.\nClimate.\nLike the rest of Sierra Leone, Freetown has a tropical climate with a rainy season from May through November; the balance of the year represents the dry season. The beginning and end of the rainy season is marked by strong thunderstorms. Under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Freetown has a tropical monsoon climate (\"Am\") primarily due to the heavy amount of precipitation it receives during the rainy season.\nFreetown's high humidity is somewhat relieved December through February by the famous Harmattan, a wind blowing from the Sahara Desert, affording Freetown its coolest period of the year. Temperature extremes recorded in Freetown are from to all year. The average annual temperature is around .\nIn 2021, the city appointed its first heat officer, Eugenia Kargbo, to address the impact of rising temperatures in the city.\nDemographics.\nFreetown is home to a large population of both Muslims and Christians, though Muslims make up the majority of the population. In the youth populations of both faiths can be found a significant liberal influence. Like the rest of Sierra Leone, Freetown is a religiously tolerant city, with Muslims and Christians living side by side peacefully.\nAs in many parts of Sierra Leone, the Krio language (the English-based creole language of the Sierra Leone Creole people who make up 5% of the country's population) is by far the most widely spoken language in the city. The language is spoken at home as a first language by over 20% of the city's population and is spoken as a lingua franca by a large number of the population in the city. English (the country's official language) is also widely spoken, particularly by the well-educated. Themne is the second most spoken language in Freetown after Krio. The Themne people also make up the largest members of the population of Freetown and the Western Area Region.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGovernment.\nThe city of Freetown is one of Sierra Leone's six municipalities and is governed by a directly elected city council, headed by a mayor, in whom executive authority is vested. The current mayor is Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr. The mayor is responsible for the general management of the city. The mayor and members of the Freetown City Council are elected directly by the residents of Freetown every four years.\nThe government of the Freetown Municipality has been dominated by All People's Congress (APC) since 2004. Since 2004, the residents of Freetown have voted in municipal elections for members of the All People's Congress (APC) by an overwhelming majority. The APC won the city's mayorship and vast majority seats in the Freetown city council in the 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2018 local elections by more than 67% each.\nIn Presidential elections Freetown is considered a swing city, as it has a large support base of both the All People's Congress and the Sierra Leone People's Party. However, the APC has won majority percent of the votes in Freetown in the 2007, 2012 and 2018 Sierra Leone Presidential election, including The APC winning more than 65% of the votes in Freetown in both The 2012 and 2018 Sierra Leone Presidential elections. The APC presidential candidate Ernest Bai Koroma received 69% of the votes in Freetown in the 2012 Sierra Leone Presidential election; compared to the SLPP presidential candidate Julius Maada Bio who received 30%. In the 2018 Sierra Leone Presidential election, The APC presidential candidate Samura Kamara received 65% compared to the SLPP presidential candidate Julius Maada Bio who received 34%, though Maada Bio won the presidential election nationally.\nIn November 2011, Freetown Mayor Herbert George-Williams was removed from office and replaced by council member Alhaji Gibril Kanu as acting mayor. Mayor Herbert George-Williams and eight others, including the Chief Administrator of the Freetown city council Bowenson Fredrick Philips; and the Freetown city council Treasurer Sylvester Momoh Konnehi, were arrested and indicted by the Sierra Leone Anti-corruption Commission on twenty-five counts on graft charges, ranging from conspiracy to commit corruption to misappropriation of public funds. Mayor Herbert George-Williams was acquitted of seventeen of the nineteen charges against him. He was convicted of two less serious charges by the Freetown High Court judge Jon Bosco Katutsi and sentenced to pay a fine.\nActing Mayor Kanu lost the APC nomination for the mayor of Freetown in the 2012 Mayoral elections by 56 votes; council member Sam Franklyn Bode Gibson won 106 in a landslide victory.\nIn the national presidential and parliamentary elections, Freetown is similar to swing states in American politics. As the city is so ethnically diverse, no single ethnic group forms a majority of the population of the city. Historically, the APC and the SLPP, two of the country's major political parties, have had about equal support in the city. In the 2007 Sierra Leone Presidential election, the APC candidate and then main opposition leader, Ernest Bai Koroma, won just over 60% of the votes in the Western Area Urban District, including the city of Freetown, where almost the entire District population reside.\nCulture.\nThe city has the Sierra Leone National Museum and Sierra Leone National Railway Museum. There are also various historical landmarks connected to its founding by African Americans, Liberated Africans, and Afro-Caribbeans whose descendants are the Sierra Leone Creole people. The Cotton Tree represents the christening of Freetown in March 1792. In downtown Freetown is the Connaught Hospital, the first hospital constructed in West Africa that incorporated Western medical practices.\nFreetown has a long-held tradition of organized cultural events taking place on specific dates to coincide with specific holidays or seasons within the calendar year. One such event is the Eastern Paddle Hunting Society's annual exhibition of a highly sophisticated masquerade, consisting of a costume built, in a fashionable sense, of various materials available: leather, sequins, sea shells, traditional cloths, etc. The masquerade, known as \"Paddle\", strategically takes to the streets of the eastern and central parts of the city, followed by members of the Eastern Paddle Hunting Society, traditional musical bands and a crowd of supporters. For years this event coincided with the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha until recently, as critics said such an event should not be held on the same day as Muslims celebrate Eid, as Islam is against the practices of secret societies and masquerades.\nThe \"Tangays\" Festival is usually held in November, with a traditional theme that involves virtually every aspect of Sierra Leonean culture. It takes place at the National Stadium. Towards the end of the festival, a couple of musical concerts are usually held in the main bowl of the stadium, with performances from local and international musical artists (especially contemporary artists from Nigeria and other African countries or the African diaspora).\nFreetown has its own tradition of Christmas street parades, organised in neighbourhoods across the city. The month-long celebration gathers residents in the streets with a variety of food and traditional music.\nThe Lantan (Lantern) Festival takes place on the last day of Ramadan each year. After a long month of fasting, participants spend the day at home eating, praying, and later head out to clubs to celebrate. That night, communities gather to showcase elaborate lantans. A designated area in the capital, Freetown, serves as the judging point, where the judges (an organization known as the YMMA) evaluate the lantans at two key locations. Each lantan is mounted on a wheeled iron chassis and hauled through the city by lantan clubs, often moving to the beat of classic Sierra Leonean tunes and instrumentals played by club members. The lantans are large and intricate, sometimes built in the form of animals, humans, mythical beings, and warships, stretching twenty feet long and up to ten feet high, providing a platform for social commentary by incorporating cultural themes and representing political themes relevant to Freetown\u2019s history with colonialism. \nAs the lantans move through the city, they are lit from within electric bulbs powered by generators, creating a glowing spectacle. Onlookers would fill the city, leaving no bar, allet, or street corner empty. Club members, dressed in matching aswebi (family attire), dancing and singing along to the music filling the streets. Judges assess by the coordination of the group and the creativity of the aswebi, but mainly the lantan\u2019s design.\nTourism.\nFreetown's tourism sector is an integral part of the city. Although the sector was seriously affected during the Civil War, there has been a steady improvement in recent years. The city has a lot to offer to tourists. There is a vast expanse of white sand beaches stretching along the Freetown Peninsula. The Lumley-Aberdeen beach stretches all the way from Cape Sierra Leone down to Lumley. There are also other popular beaches like the world renowned River Number 2 Beach, Laka Beach, Tokeh Beach, Bureh Beach, and Mama Beach. The Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary, which is located within the peninsula's vast rainforest reserve, just a few miles from the centre of Freetown, has a collection of rare and endangered chimpanzees. Other popular destinations for tourists include the Freetown Cotton Tree, located in Central Freetown, a significant national monument and integral to the founding of the city; Bunce Island, which is a boat ride from the city, is home to the ruins of the slave fortress that was being used during the Transatlantic slave trade; the Sierra Leone Museum, which has a collection of both precolonial as well as colonial artifacts and other items of historical significance; the National Railway Museum; and a journey around the city's coastline with the popular Seacoach Express.\nThe Aberdeen-Lumley area is a favourite destination for those venturing into the city's nightlife. There are nightclubs, restaurants and hotels located close by the beach along the road linking Aberdeen and Lumley.\nArchitecture.\nNearby is the King's Yard Gate built in stone with a statement inscribed which reads \"any slave who passes through this gate is declared a free man\", and it was this gate through which liberated Africans passed. Down by the Naval Wharf are slave steps carved out of stone. Before Freetown was established, this was where the Portuguese slave traders transported Africans as slaves to ships.\nFreetown is home to Fourah Bay College, the oldest university in West Africa, founded in 1827. The university played a key role in Sierra Leone's colonial history. The college's first student, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, went on to be named as the first indigenous Bishop of West Africa. National Railway Museum has a coach car built for the state visit of Elizabeth II in 1961. The Big Market on Wallace Johnson Street is the showcase for local artisans' work.\nThe Freetown peninsula is ringed by long stretches of white sand. Lumley Beach, on the western side of the peninsula, is a popular location for local parties and festivals.\nPlaces of worship.\nAmong the places of worship, Christian churches predominate and the remaining religious institutions are predominantly Muslim mosques. Among the Christian churches and temples: Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Freetown (Catholic Church), United Methodist Church in Sierra Leone (World Methodist Council), Baptist Convention of Sierra Leone (Baptist World Alliance), Assemblies of God, and St. George's Cathedral (Anglican) which opened in 1828.\nEconomy.\nFreetown is the economic and financial centre of Sierra Leone. The country's state television and radio station, the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation, is primarily based in Freetown. The other national broadcasters, such as AYV (African Young Voices) and Capital Radio, are also based in Freetown. Many of the national headquarters of the country's largest corporations, as well as the majority of international companies, are located in Freetown - predominately in Central Freetown.\nThe city's economy revolves largely around its natural harbour, which is the largest natural harbour on the African continent. Queen Elizabeth II Quay is capable of receiving oceangoing vessels and handles Sierra Leone's main exports.\nIndustries include food and beverage processing, fish packing, rice milling, petroleum refining, diamond cutting, and the manufacture of cigarettes, paint, textile, and beer.\nThe city is served by the Freetown International Airport, located in Lungi, across the river estuary from Freetown.\nIn almost every neighborhood of Freetown there are a number of high streets with shops of various kinds of commercial products and services. Shop traders are diverse, including locals and foreign shop owners. However, a majority of locals shop at specific and popular areas of the city, such as Lumley Junction, Eastern Police Junction, PZ area, Shell Junction, etc.\nEducation.\nFreetown (as the rest of Sierra Leone) has an education system with six years of primary school (Classes 1 to 6), and six years of secondary school (Forms 1 to 6). Secondary schools are further divided into Junior secondary school (Forms 1 to 3) and Senior secondary school (Forms 4 to 6). This system is known as the 6-3-3-4 education system, which means: 6 years of Primary, 3 years of Junior Secondary, 3 years of Senior Secondary, and 4 years of university.\nPrimary school pupils are usually aged 6 to 12, and secondary schools are usually aged 13 to 18. Primary Education is free and compulsory in government-sponsored public schools. Freetown is home to one of the country's two main universities, the Fourah Bay College, the oldest university in West Africa, founded in 1827.\nTransportation.\nAir transportation.\nFreetown International Airport is the international airport which serves Freetown and the rest of the country. It is located in the town of Lungi, about 17\u00a0km north-east of Freetown across the sea. It serves as the primary airport for domestic and international travel to and from Sierra Leone. The airport is operated by Sierra Leone Airports Authority. There is a frequent commercial fast boat, bus, and ferry service to Freetown and other parts of the country. Hastings Airport provides secondary service, but can only handle small aircraft because of its short runway. It is located about 14\u00a0km south-east of downtown Freetown (nearly 22\u00a0km by road).\nTransfers to Freetown.\nPassengers have the choice of hovercraft, ferry, road (5 hours), speedboat, water taxi, local banana boats and helicopter to cross the river to Freetown. Ferry is the cheapest option. Hovercraft and ferry operations have at times been suspended due to passenger overloads and safety issues. Several piers are unusable at low-tide. During these times, there is no dry path from land to the speedboats or water taxi. Operators offer from the beachhead to hoist passengers and their luggage above water-level while themselves wade into the sea to help patrons and their belongings board.\nAccess by sea.\nSierra Leone has the largest natural harbour on the African continent. Ships from all over the globe berth at Freetown's Queen Elizabeth II Quay. Passenger, cargo, and private craft also utilize Government Wharf nearer to central Freetown. Recent investment has seen the introduction of high-tech cargo scanning facilities.\nAccess by land.\nRoad.\nSierra Leone's infrastructure is limited, and its highways and roads reflect this. The roads and highways of the country are administered by the Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA) which has often been crippled by corruption. Highway 1 enters the city from the town of Waterloo, several kilometers to the south. Despite the SLRA's limited capabilities, main feeder/trunk roads have been reconstructed to a high standard.\nRailway.\nFollowing a recommendation from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Sierra Leone Government Railway which linked Freetown to the rest of the country was permanently closed in 1974. The iron rails were looted in the following years.\nSports.\nLike the rest of Sierra Leone, football is the most popular sport in Freetown. The Sierra Leone national football team, popularly known as the Leone Stars plays all their home games at Freetown's National Stadium, the largest stadium in Sierra Leone.\nEight of the fifteen clubs in the Sierra Leone National Premier League are from Freetown, including two of Sierra Leone's biggest and most successful football clubs, East End Lions and Mighty Blackpool. A match between these two teams is the biggest domestic-football clash in Sierra Leone. A notable Sierra Leonian footballer is Kei Kamara, who plays for Los Angeles FC of Major League Soccer.\nTwin towns/sister cities.\nFreetown is officially twinned with five cities:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was formerly spelled as Gaberones during the colonial era, a name still occasionally used in older English texts and maps. With a population of 246,325 based on the 2022 census, about 10% of the total population of Botswana. Its metropolitan area is home to 534,842 inhabitants at the 2022 census. \nGaborone is situated between Kgale Hill and Oodi Hill, near the confluence of the Notwane River and Segoditshane River in the southeastern corner of Botswana, within from the South African border. The city is served by the Sir Seretse Khama International Airport. It is an administrative district in its own right, but is the capital of the surrounding South-East District. Locals often refer to the city as \"GC or Motse-Mshate\".\nThe city of Gaborone is named after Chief Gaborone of the Tlokwa people, who once controlled land nearby. Because it was not affiliated with any specific indigenous group and was close to fresh water, the city was planned to be the capital in the mid-1960s when the Bechuanaland Protectorate became an independent nation. The centre of the city comprises a long strip of commercial businesses, called \"Main Mall\", with a semi-circular area of government offices to its east. Gaborone was once one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, and this has created problems with housing and illegal settlements. The city has also dealt with conflicts spilling into the country from Zimbabwe and South Africa during the 1980s.\nGaborone is the political and economic capital of Botswana, home to its largest companies and the Botswana Stock Exchange. It is also serves as the headquarters of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The main spoken languages in the city include Setswana (Tswana), English, Kalanga, and Kgalagadi.\nHistory.\nEvidence shows that there have been inhabitants along the Notwane River for centuries. In more recent history, the Tlokwa left the Magaliesberg ranges to settle in the area around 1880, and called the settlement \"Moshaweng\". The word \"Gaborone\" literally means \"it does not fit badly\" or \"it is not unbecoming\". The city was then called \"Gaberones\" by early European colonizers. Gaberones, a shortening of \"Gaborone's Village\", was named after Chief Gaborone of the Tlokwa, whose home village (now called Tlokweng) was across the river from the Government Camp, the name of the colonial government headquarters. The nickname, \"GC\", comes from the name \"Government Camp\". In 1890, Cecil John Rhodes picked Gaberones to house a colonial fort. The fort was where Rhodes planned the Jameson Raid. The city changed its name from Gaberones to Gaborone in 1969.\nThe modern town was only founded in 1964, after a decision was taken to establish a capital for Botswana, which became a self governing territory in 1965, before becoming a fully independent republic on 30 September 1966.\nIn 1965, the capital of the Bechuanaland Protectorate moved from Mafeking to Gaberones. When Botswana gained its independence, Lobatse was the first choice as the nation's capital. However, Lobatse was deemed too limited, and instead, a new capital city would be created next to Gaberones. The city was chosen because of its proximity to a fresh water source, its proximity to the railway to Pretoria, its central location among the central tribes, and its lack of association with those surrounding tribes.\nThe city was planned under Garden city principles with numerous pedestrian walkways and open spaces. Building of Gaborone started in mid-1964. During the city's construction, the chairman of Gaberones Township Authority, Geoffrey Cornish, likened the layout of the city to a \"brandy glass\" with the government offices in the base of the glass and businesses in the \"mall\", a strip of land extending from the base.\nMost of the early town was built within three years, as a small town designed to accommodate 20,000 people \u2013 only to later develop after independence into a modern city. Buildings in early Gaborone include assembly buildings, government offices, a power station, a hospital, schools, a radio station, a telephone exchange, police stations, a post office, and more than 1,000 houses. Because the town was built so quickly, there was a massive influx of labourers who had built illegal settlements on the new city's southern industrial development zone. These settlements were named Naledi. The latter term literally means \"the star\", but could also mean \"under the open sky\" or \"a community that stands out from all others\". In 1971, because of the growth of illegal settlements, the Gaborone Town Council and the Ministry of Local Government and Lands surveyed an area called Bontleng, which would contain low-income housing. However, Naledi still grew, and the demand for housing was greater than ever. In 1973, the Botswana Housing Corporation (BHC) built a \"New Naledi\" across the road from the \"Old Naledi\". Residents from Old Naledi would be moved to New Naledi. However, the demand for housing increased yet again; moreover, the residents who relocated to New Naledi disliked the houses. The problem was solved in 1975 when Sir Seretse Khama, the president of Botswana, rezoned Naledi from an industrial zone to a low-income housing area.\nOn 30 September 1966, Bechuanaland became the eleventh British dependency in Africa to become independent. The first mayor of Gaborone was Reverend Derek Jones. The old Gaberones became a suburb of the new Gaborone, and is now known as \"the Village\".\nIn the mid-1980s, South Africa attacked Botswana and conducted raids on Gaborone and other border towns. The Raid on Gaborone resulted in twelve deaths.\nAfter the 1994 General Elections, riots started in Gaborone because of high unemployment and other issues.\nToday, Gaborone is growing very rapidly. In 1964, Gaborone only had 3,855 citizens; seven years later, the city had almost 18,000 residents. The city originally planned on 20,000 citizens, but by 1992, the city had 138,000 people. This has led to many squatter settlements on undeveloped land. Former mayor Veronica Lesole has stated that Gaborone's development problems were caused by the original city planners.\nGeography.\nGaborone is situated at between Kgale and Oodi Hills, on the Notwane River in the south-eastern corner of Botswana, and from the South African border. The city lies at an elevation of above sea level. Gaborone is surrounded by the following cities: Ramotswa to the southwest, Mogoditshane to the northwest, and Mochudi to the east, and Tlokweng across the river. Most of them are commuter towns for Gaborone. Suburbs in Gaborone include Broadhurst, Gaborone West, The Village, Naledi. Phakalane, an affluent suburb, lies about 13\u00a0km north of the city center.\nIn the centre of the city lies the Main Mall which houses many diplomatic missions. At the eastern end of the Mall, one can find the Civic Centre along with the Pula Arch that commemorates Botswana's independence.

The city of Gaborone is home to over 10% of the population of Botswana. Almost half of Botswana citizens live within of Gaborone.\nThe population growth rate of Gaborone is 3.4%, the highest in the country. This is most likely because the city has a more developed infrastructure, making it more livable. Gaborone is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world.

It is composed of 35 councillors representing the wards of Gaborone. The Townships Act mandates the structure of local governments in Botswana. Because Botswana is a unitary state, the power of the local councils are delegated from the national level. The Ministry of Local Government, Land and Housing has a major influence in terms of personnel hiring and training, budgeting, and development planning.\nThe city commission-style council is run by the city clerk and the deputy city clerk. The city is governed by the mayor, deputy mayor, and several committees run by councillors: the financial and general purposes committee; the public health, social welfare and housing committee; the Self-Help Housing Agency (SHAA) management committee; the town planning committee; the trade licensing committee; and the education committee.

Other local channels based in Gaborone are Now TV, Khuduga HD, Access TV &amp; Maru TV.\n93.7% of the households in Gaborone have a cell phone.\nInfrastructure.\nGaborone is one of the fastest-growing cities in Africa. The growth of Gaborone, especially suburban growth, has caused much of the farmland surrounding the city to be absorbed into the city. Much of the food for Gaborone comes from north of the city with some smaller-scale farms on the southern end.\nThe city centre was planned to be functionalist, with major buildings designed and built in the style of Modern architecture. The city is surrounded by smaller buildings. The city's central business district (CBD) is still under construction so when one says \"downtown\", they actually mean the \"Main Mall\" and \"Government Enclave\" areas where tall buildings are usually found. The Main Mall, a car-free shopping and commercial area, runs in an east\u2013west direction with the Government Enclave and National Assembly on the west end and the Gaborone City Town Council complex on the east.\nGaborone's CBD is home to the new Square Mall, The Tower, the new SADC headquarters, the Industrial Court, a court specifically for settling trade disputes, and the Three Dikgosi Monument, a landmark featuring the statues of Khama III, Sebele I, and Bathoen I, three dikgosi, or chiefs, who traveled to Great Britain to establish the Bechuanaland Protectorate separate from Southern Rhodesia (present-day Zimbabwe) or the Cape Colony (present-day South Africa). The monument was inaugurated on 29 September 2005. While the statues represent famous historical figures, there has been some controversy over the cost of the construction, P12,000,000 (approx. US$1.7M, \u20ac1.4M, or \u00a31.1M as of June 2010), and over the construction company, North Korean Mansudae Overseas Projects, putting the wrong inscription date. Other buildings under construction in the CBD include the Holiday Inn Gaborone, retail space, and office space.\nUtilities.\nThe city gets most of its water from the reservoir formed from the Gaborone Dam on the southeast side of the city, which has facilitated growth. The city of Gaborone was originally constructed as a small town, so the Gaborone Dam needed to be built to provide water for all its citizens.\nFrom 2007 to 2008, of water was sold in Gaborone. The government sector bought the most water, . of water was bought for domestic use, and of water was bought by the commercial and industrial sectors. In 2008, the city of Gaborone consumed of water, and the water consumption per capita was per person per year, the lowest rate since 1999.\nGaborone has some of the highest water tariffs in the country because of high transportation costs and high water consumption. The high tariffs may also be due to the fact that some of Gaborone's water supply is imported from the Letsibogo Dam.\nThe average pH of the water in the Gaborone Dam is 7.95 as of February 2006. The concentration of calcium in the reservoir was 14.87milligrams per litre from April 2001 to August 2006. During the same period, the concentration of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) was 57.73 milligrams per litre, slightly over Botswana's ideal concentration which means the water is hard. Also during the same period, the chloride concentration was 6.44\u00a0mg/l, the fluoride concentration was 0.54\u00a0mg/l, the potassium concentration was 6.72\u00a0mg/l, and the sodium concentration was 10.76\u00a0mg/l.\nHealthcare.\nThe Botswana Red Cross Society, established in 1968, is headquartered in Gaborone. The Princess Marina Hospital is the main referral hospital in Gaborone and houses 500 beds.\nThere is also Gaborone Private Hospital and Sidilega Private Hospital all operating in the city of Gaborone. \nThe Cancer Association of Botswana is a voluntary non-governmental organization established as a trust in 1998. \nHIV/AIDS.\nAIDS is a very serious problem in Gaborone. 17,773 Gaborone citizens, 17.1% of the total population of Gaborone, have tested positive for HIV. There is a higher prevalence of HIV among women; 20.5% of women have tested positive compared to 13.6% of men. The population between 45 and 49 years of age are most likely to have AIDS with 35.4% of the residents in that age group testing positive.\nHIV/AIDS education is extensive in Gaborone. However, a 2008 study shows that 14.5% of Gaborone residents between 10 and 64 who have heard of HIV/AIDS believe that HIV can be spread through witchcraft, and 31.3% of the residents believe HIV can be spread through mosquito bites.\nTransportation.\nRailways.\nThe railway that served the founding purpose of the city remains important, bisecting the city in a north\u2013south direction. Botswana Railways runs a line that goes from Cape Town to Harare via Bulawayo. The railway station in Gaborone is located south of the Parliament House in the city's centre. The line stops at the following cities in and near Botswana: Ramatlabama on the South African border, Lobatse, Gaborone, Palapye, Serule, Francistown, Ramokgwebana, and Plumtree, Zimbabwe. The line became a cargo-only line on 1 April 2009 but passenger services resumed in early 2016.\nAirports.\nSir Seretse Khama International Airport lies north of the city and in 2018 has flights to Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban, Addis Ababa and various domestic destinations. It is the headquarters of Air Botswana, the national airline of Botswana.\nIn 2008, Sir Seretse Khama International Airport handled 15,844 aircraft movements, second only to Maun Airport Air traffic in Gaborone has decreased since 2006. However, Gaborone has the most air passenger traffic, accounting for 51.6% of all passenger movement in Botswana. International passengers total 244,073 passengers while domestic air passenger movement comes up to 333,390 passengers. Gaborone International Airport terminal was rebuilt into a modern terminal in 2010.\nRoads.\nHighways in and around Gaborone include the Trans-Kalahari Highway, A1 Highway, A10 Highway and the Cairo-Cape Town Highway. There are five major roads in Gaborone that go to Lobatse, Kanye, Molepolole, Francistown via Mochudi, and Tlokweng.\nPublic transport.\nPublic transport in the city is generally reliable, when compared with major African cities. \"Kombis\" (small vans) and taxis ply the routes within the city, while buses serve surrounding villages and other towns in Botswana.\nPrivate traffic.\nGaborone has several vehicle licensing stations. 15,538 new private motor vehicles, accounting for 46.5% of Botswana's total new vehicle registrations, were registered in Gaborone in 2008, of which 8,440 were passenger cars, 440 were minibuses, 204 were motorcycles, and 181 were tractors. The total has increased from 12,690 new vehicle registrations in 2007. Gaborone also has the highest number of vehicle registration renewals at 73,206 in 2008.\nIncluding the district of Gaborone West, Gaborone had 9,415 vehicle accidents with 74 human fatalities in 2008. Most of the traffic collisions in that year, 3,146 collisions, were side collisions. 263 accidents involved animals. The city has also seen 679 pedestrian casualties in 2008; 24 pedestrians were killed. The majority of vehicle accident casualties involved pedestrians, and most traffic accidents occur between 16:00 and 18:00.\nInternational relations.\nGaborone has been twinned with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nLat.

The name \"Hanoi\" translates to \"inside the river\" (Hanoi is bordered by the Red and Black Rivers). The city encompasses an area of , and as of 2025 has a population of 8,807,523. Hanoi had the second-highest gross regional domestic product of all Vietnamese provinces and municipalities at US$48 billion in 2023, behind only Ho Chi Minh City.\nIn the third century BCE, the C\u1ed5 Loa Capital Citadel of \u00c2u L\u1ea1c was constructed in what is now Hanoi. \u00c2u L\u1ea1c then fell under Chinese rule for a thousand years. In 1010, under the L\u00fd dynasty, Vietnamese emperor L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 established the capital of the imperial Vietnamese nation \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t in modern-day central Hanoi, naming the city Th\u0103ng Long , 'ascending dragon'). In 1428, King L\u00ea L\u1ee3i renamed the city to \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh , 'eastern capital'), and it remained so until 1789. The Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty in 1802 moved the national capital to Hu\u1ebf and the city was renamed Hanoi in 1831. It served as the capital of French Indochina from 1902 to 1945 and French protectorate of Tonkin from 1883 to 1949. After the August Revolution and the fall of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) designated Hanoi as the capital of the newly independent country. From 1949 to 1954, it was part of the State of Vietnam. It was again part of the DRV ruling North Vietnam from 1954 to 1976. In 1976, it became the capital of the unified Socialist Republic of Vietnam. In 2008, H\u00e0 T\u00e2y Province and two other rural districts were annexed into Hanoi, almost tripling Hanoi's area.\nHanoi is the cultural, economic and educational center of Northern Vietnam. As the country's capital, it hosts 78 foreign embassies, the headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army (VPA), its own Vietnam National University system, and many other governmental organizations. Hanoi is also a major tourist destination, with 18.7 million domestic and international visitors in 2022. The city hosts the Imperial Citadel of Th\u0103ng Long, Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake, West Lake, and Ba V\u00ec National Park near the outskirts of the municipality. Hanoi's urban area has a wide range of architectural styles, including French colonial architecture, brutalist apartments typical of socialist nations, and disorganized alleys and tube houses stemming from the city's rapid growth in the 20th century.\nNames.\nHanoi has had various names throughout history. It was known first as Long Bi\u00ean (, lit.\u2009'dragons interweaving'), then T\u1ed1ng B\u00ecnh (, lit.\u2009'Song pacification') and Long \u0110\u1ed7 (, lit.\u2009'dragon belly'). \"Long Bi\u00ean\" later gave its name to the famed Long Bi\u00ean Bridge, built during French colonial times, and more recently to a new district to the east of the Red River. Several older names of Hanoi feature \"long\" (, transl.\u2009dragon), linked to the curved formation of the Red River around the city, which was symbolized as a dragon.\nIn 866, it was turned into a citadel and named \u0110\u1ea1i La (, lit.\u2009'big net'). This gave it the nickname La Th\u00e0nh (, lit.\u2009'\"La\" citadel'). Both \"\u0110\u1ea1i La\" and \"La Th\u00e0nh\" are names of major streets in modern Hanoi. When L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 established the capital in the area in 1010, it was named Th\u0103ng Long (). \"Th\u0103ng Long\" later became the name of a major bridge on the highway linking the city center to N\u1ed9i B\u00e0i Airport, and the Th\u0103ng Long Boulevard expressway in the southwest of the city center. In modern times, the city is usually referred to as \"Th\u0103ng Long \u2013 H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i\", when its long history is discussed.\nDuring the H\u1ed3 dynasty, it was called \u0110\u00f4ng \u0110\u00f4 (, lit.\u2009'eastern metropolis'). During the Ming occupation, it was called \u0110\u00f4ng Quan (, lit.\u2009'eastern gate'). During the L\u00ea dynasty, Hanoi was known as \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh (), which gave the name to Tonkin and Gulf of Tonkin. A square adjacent to the Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm lake was named \"\u0110\u00f4ng Kinh Ngh\u0129a Th\u1ee5c\" after the reformist Tonkin Free School under French colonization.\nAfter the end of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n had expanded further south, the city was named B\u1eafc Th\u00e0nh (, lit.\u2009'northern citadel'). Minh M\u1ea1ng renamed the city H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i () in 1831. This has remained its official name until modern times.\nSeveral unofficial names of Hanoi include: (, lit.\u2009'marketplace'), (lit.\u2009'long peace'), (short for , 'citadel of Th\u0103ng Long'), ('capital city'), (short for , 'city of Hanoi'), and ('capital').\nArab manuscripts between the 9th and 12th century referred to Hanoi as (), a term derived from \"Longbian\" (Middle Chinese: ), and was originally used by Muslim traders to mention the Vietnamese.\nHistory.\nPre-Th\u0103ng Long period.\nMany vestiges of human habitation from the late Palaeolithic and early Mesolithic ages can be found in Hanoi. Between 1971 and 1972, archaeologists in Ba V\u00ec and \u0110\u00f4ng Anh discovered pebbles with traces of carving and processing by human hands that are relics of S\u01a1n Vi Culture, dating from 10,000 to 20,000 years ago. In 1998\u20131999, the Museum of Vietnamese History (now National Museum of Vietnamese History) carried out the archaeological studies in the north of \u0110\u1ed3ng M\u00f4 Lake (S\u01a1n T\u00e2y, Hanoi), finding various relics and objects belonging to the S\u01a1n Vi Culture dating back to the Paleolithic Age around 20,000 years ago. During the mid-Holocene transgression, the sea level rose and immersed low-lying areas; geological data clearly show the coastline was inundated and was located near present-day Hanoi, as is apparent from the absence of Neolithic sites across most of the Bac Bo region. Consequently, from about 10,000 to approximately 4,000 years ago, Hanoi in general was completely underwater. It is believed that the region has been continuously inhabited for the last 4,000 years.\nKingdom of \u00c2u L\u1ea1c and Nanyue.\nIn around third century BC, An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng established the capital of \u00c2u L\u1ea1c north of present-day Hanoi, where a fortified citadel is constructed, known to history as C\u1ed5 Loa, the first political center of the Vietnamese civilization pre-Sinitic era, with an outer embankment covering 600 hectares. In 179 BC, the \u00c2u L\u1ea1c Kingdom was annexed by Nanyue, which ushered in more than a thousand years of Chinese domination. Zhao Tuo subsequently incorporated the regions into his Nanyue domain, but left the indigenous chiefs in control of the population. For the first time, the region formed part of a polity headed by a Chinese ruler.\nHanoi under Chinese rule.\nIn 111 BC, the Han dynasty conquered Nanyue and ruled it for the next several hundred years. Han dynasty organized Nanyue into seven commanderies of the south (Lingnan) and now included three in Vietnam alone: Giao Ch\u1ec9 and C\u1eedu Ch\u00e2n, and a newly established Nh\u1eadt Nam.\nIn March of 40 AD, Tr\u01b0ng Tr\u1eafc and Tr\u01b0ng Nh\u1ecb, daughters of a wealthy aristocratic family of Lac ethnicity in M\u00ea Linh district (Hanoi), led the locals to rise up in rebellion against the Han. It began at the Red River Delta, but quickly spread both south and north from Jiaozhi, stirring up all three L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t regions and most of Lingnan, gaining the support of about 65 towns and settlements. Tr\u01b0ng sisters then established their court upriver in M\u00ea Linh. In 42 AD, the Han emperor commissioned general Ma Yuan to suppress the uprising with 32,000 men, including 20,000 regulars and 12,000 regional auxiliaries. The rebellion was defeated in the next year as Ma Yuan captured and decapitated Tr\u01b0ng Tr\u1eafc and Tr\u01b0ng Nh\u1ecb, then sent their heads to the Han court in Luoyang.\nBy the middle of the fifth century, in the center of ancient Hanoi, a fortified settlement was founded by the Chinese Liu Song dynasty as the seat of a new district called T\u1ed1ng B\u00ecnh (Songping) within Giao Ch\u1ec9 commandery. The name refers to its pacification by the dynasty. It was elevated to its own commandery at some point between AD\u00a0454 and 464. The commandery included the districts of Yihuai (\u7fa9\u61f7) and Suining (\u7d8f\u5be7) in the south of the Red River (now T\u1eeb Li\u00eam and Ho\u00e0i \u0110\u1ee9c districts) with a metropolis in present-day inner Hanoi.\nProtectorate of Annam.\nBy the year 679, the Tang dynasty changed the region's name to Annan (lit. 'pacified south'), with Songping as its capital.\nIn the latter half of the eighth century, Zhang Boyi, a viceroy from the Tang dynasty, built Luocheng () to suppress popular uprisings. Luocheng extended from Thu Le to Quan Ngua in what is now Ba \u0110\u00ecnh district. Over time, in the first half of the ninth century, this fortification was expanded and renamed as Jincheng (). In 863, the kingdom of Nanzhao, as well as local rebels, laid siege of Jincheng and defeated the Chinese armies of 150,000. In 866, Chinese jiedushi Gao Pian recaptured the city and drove out the Nanzhao and rebels. He renamed the city to Daluocheng (). He built a wall around the city measuring 6,344 meters, with some sections reaching over eight meters in height. \u0110\u1ea1i La at the time had approximately 25,000 residents, including small foreign communities of Persians, Arabs, Indian, Cham, Javanese, and Nestorian Christians. It became an important trading center of the Tang dynasty due to the ransacking of Guangzhou by the Huang Chao rebellion. By early tenth century AD, modern-day Hanoi was known to the Muslim traders as Luqin.\nHanoi under Independent Vietnam.\nTh\u0103ng Long, \u0110\u00f4ng \u0110\u00f4, \u0110\u00f4ng Quan, \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh.\nIn 1010, L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5, the first ruler of the L\u00fd dynasty, moved the capital of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t to the site of the \u0110\u1ea1i La Citadel. Claiming to have seen a dragon ascending the Red River, he renamed the site Th\u0103ng Long (\u6607\u9f8d) \u2013 a name still used poetically to this day. Th\u0103ng Long remained the capital of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t until 1397, when it was moved to Thanh H\u00f3a, then known as T\u00e2y \u0110\u00f4 (\u897f\u90fd), the \"Western Capital\". Th\u0103ng Long then became \u0110\u00f4ng \u0110\u00f4 (\u6771\u90fd), the \"Eastern Capital\".\nIn 1408, the Chinese Ming dynasty attacked and occupied Vietnam, changing \u0110\u00f4ng \u0110\u00f4's name to Dongguan (lit. 'eastern gate'). In 1428, the Lam S\u01a1n uprising, under the leadership of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, overthrew the Chinese rule. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i founded the L\u00ea dynasty and renamed \u0110\u00f4ng Quan to \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh (\u6771\u4eac) or Tonkin. During 17th century, the population of \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh was estimated by Western diplomats as about 100,000. Right after the end of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasty, it was named B\u1eafc Th\u00e0nh (\u5317\u57ce).\nDuring Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty and the French colonial period.\nWhen the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty was established in 1802, Gia Long moved the capital to Hu\u1ebf. Th\u0103ng Long was no longer the capital, and its ch\u1eef H\u00e1n was changed from \u6607\u9f8d (lit.\u2009'ascending dragon') to the homophone \u6607\u9686 (lit.\u2009'ascent and prosperity'), in order to reduce any loyalist sentiment towards the old L\u00ea dynasty. Emperors of Vietnam usually used dragon (\u9f8d \"long\") as a symbol of their imperial strength and power. In 1831, the Nguy\u1ec5n emperor Minh M\u1ea1ng renamed it H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i (\u6cb3\u5167). Hanoi was conquered and briefly occupied by the French military in late 1873 and passed to them ten years later. As Hanoi, it was located in the protectorate of Tonkin and became the capital of French Indochina in 1902. Nominally it still belonged to the sovereignty of Vietnam (Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty) under French protectorate in Tonkin, but since 1888 it had been a French concession and had directly been ruled by the French like Cochinchina.\nDuring WWII, First Indochina War, and Vietnam War.\nFrench Indochina including Hanoi was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces in September 1940, after the Japanese invasion of French Indochina. Japan overthrew the French rule in Hanoi and formed the Empire of Vietnam in March 1945. After the fall of the Empire of Vietnam, it became the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) when Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the independence of Vietnam on 2 September 1945. However, the French returned and reoccupied the city in February 1947. After France recognized Vietnam's nominal and partial independence with the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Accords on 14 June 1949, Hanoi became under the control of the State of Vietnam from 1949 to 1954, a unified associated state within the French Union. This state gained full independence with the Matignon Accords on 4 June 1954. In January 1953, Hanoi held the free municipal elections of the State of Vietnam. After eight years of fighting between the French and DRV forces, Hanoi became the capital of North Vietnam when this territory became a sovereign country and Vietnam became divided at 17th parallel on 21 July 1954. The army of the French Union withdrew to the South that year and the People's Army of Vietnam of the DRV and International Control Commission occupied the city on 10 October the same year under the terms of the 1954 Geneva Conference.\nDuring the Vietnam War between North and South (1955\u20131975), North Vietnam (including Hanoi) was attacked by the United States and South Vietnamese Air Forces. Following the end of the war with the fall of Saigon in 1975, Hanoi became the capital of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam when North and South Vietnam were reunited on 2 July 1976.\nModern Hanoi.\nOn 21 December 1978, the National Assembly of Vietnam approved a law to expand Hanoi's borders, absorbing the districts of Ba V\u00ec, Th\u1ea1ch Th\u1ea5t, Ph\u00fac Th\u1ecd, \u0110an Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng, Ho\u00e0i \u0110\u1ee9c, and the town of S\u01a1n T\u00e2y from H\u00e0 S\u01a1n B\u00ecnh Province, and the districts of M\u00ea Linh and S\u00f3c S\u01a1n from V\u0129nh Ph\u00fa Province. The five districts annexed from H\u00e0 S\u01a1n B\u00ecnh would be given to H\u00e0 T\u00e2y and M\u00ea Linh to V\u0129nh Ph\u00fac in 1991; they would be re-annexed into Hanoi in 2008.\nAfter the \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi economic policies were approved in 1986, the Communist Party and national and municipal governments hoped to attract international investments for urban development projects in Hanoi. High-rise commercial buildings did not begin to appear until ten years later due to the international investment community being skeptical of the security of their investments in Vietnam. Rapid urban development and rising costs displaced many residential areas in central Hanoi. Following a short period of economic stagnation after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Hanoi resumed its rapid economic growth.\nOn 29 May 2008, it was decided that H\u00e0 T\u00e2y Province, V\u0129nh Ph\u00fac Province's M\u00ea Linh District and four communes in L\u01b0\u01a1ng S\u01a1n District, H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh Province be merged into the metropolitan area of Hanoi from 1 August 2008. Hanoi's total area then increased to 334,470 hectares in 29 subdivisions with the new population being 6,232,940, effectively tripling its size. The Hanoi Capital Region (), a metropolitan area covering Hanoi and six surrounding provinces under its administration, will have an area of with 15 million people by 2020.\nHanoi has experienced rapid expansion in its modern period, accompanied by a construction boom. Skyscrapers, appearing in new urban areas, have dramatically changed the cityscape and have formed a modern skyline outside the old city. In 2015, Hanoi is ranked 39th by Emporis in the list of world cities with most skyscrapers over 100\u00a0m; its two tallest buildings are Hanoi Landmark 72 Tower (336\u00a0m, second tallest in Vietnam after Ho Chi Minh City's Landmark 81 and third tallest in south-east Asia after Malaysia's Petronas Towers) and Hanoi Lotte Center (272\u00a0m, also, third tallest in Vietnam).\nPublic outcry in opposition to the redevelopment of culturally significant areas in Hanoi persuaded the national government to implement a low-rise policy surrounding Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake. The Ba \u0110\u00ecnh District is also protected from commercial redevelopment. On 12 September 2023, at least 56 people died in a huge fire in an apartment block in Hanoi. The fire highlighted the lack of adequate fire safety measures in many newly constructed apartments in the rapidly expanding city.\nGeography.\nLocation, topography.\nHanoi is a landlocked municipality in the northern region of Vietnam, situated in Vietnam's Red River Delta, nearly from the coast. Hanoi contains three basic kinds of terrain, which are the delta area, the midland area and the mountainous zone. In general, the terrain becomes gradually lower from north to south and from west to east, with the average height ranging from 5 to 20 meters above sea level. Hills and mountainous zones are located in the northern and western parts of the city. The highest peak is at Ba V\u00ec with 1281\u00a0m, located west of the city proper.\nEnvironment.\nHanoi frequently ranks among the most polluted cities, with several days each year when it is the most air-polluted city in the world, with fine dust levels reaching dangerous thresholds for human health. According to the 2018 Global Air Quality Report, Hanoi's fine dust concentration was four times higher than the WHO's recommended limit (40.8 \u03bcg/m3 compared to the recommended 10 \u03bcg/m3). A report by Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment stated that Hanoi is the most air-polluted city in the country, with a high proportion of days classified as having poor, bad, or hazardous air quality. In addition, the rivers flowing through Hanoi (Nhu\u1ec7 River, T\u00f4 L\u1ecbch River, Kim Ng\u01b0u River, L\u1eeb River, and S\u00e9t River) and many lakes are heavily polluted, as 78% of Hanoi's wastewater is discharged directly into rivers and lakes without treatment. Each of these rivers receives tens of thousands of cubic meters of wastewater daily.\nClimate.\nWhen using the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Hanoi is categorized as having a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cwa)\" with plentiful precipitation like other places in Northern Vietnam. The city experiences the typical climate of Northern Vietnam, with four distinct seasons. Summer, from May to September, is characterized by hot and humid weather with abundant rainfall, and few dry days. Hot, dry conditions caused by westerly winds during summer are rare. From October to November comprise the fall season, characterized by a decrease in temperature and precipitation, this time in the year mostly are warm and mild. Winters, from December to February, are characterized as being cool by the northeast monsoon, giving Hanoi a dry winter. Spring, from March until the end of April, Hanoi is usually characterized with large amounts of drizzle and little sunshine due to the strong activity of the southeast monsoon blowing moisture from the sea inland. The city is usually cloudy and foggy in this time, averaging only 1.5 hours of sunshine per day in February and March. The city occasionally experiences cold waves from the Northeast originating from the Siberian High. Hanoi is the only capital of Southeast Asia with a subtropical climate.\nThe region has a positive water balance (i.e. the precipitation exceeds the potential evapotranspiration). Hanoi averages of rainfall per year, the majority falling from May to October. There are an average of 114 days with rain. The average annual temperature is , with a mean relative humidity of more than 80%. The coldest month has a mean temperature of and the hottest month has a mean temperature of . The highest recorded temperature was in May 1926, while the lowest recorded temperature was on 12 January 1955. The city have also experienced extremely hot weather on 4 June 2017 due to La Ni\u00f1a, with the temperature reached up to in a week. Hanoi can sometimes experience snow in winter. During a major cold wave happened on January 2016, snow was seen to appear on Ba V\u00ec mountain range, since the temperature fell to on 24 January 2016.\nAdministrative divisions.\nAs a municipality, since 2025, Hanoi consists of 51 wards and 75 communes.\nBefore 2025.\nBefore 2025, H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i was divided into 12 urban districts, 1 district-level town and 17 rural districts. They were further subdivided into 22 commune-level towns (or townlets), 399 communes, and 145 wards. When H\u00e0 T\u00e2y merged into Hanoi in 2008, H\u00e0 \u0110\u00f4ng was transformed into an urban district while S\u01a1n T\u00e2y was demoted to a district-level town.\nHT \u2013 formerly an administrative subdivision unit of the defunct H\u00e0 T\u00e2y Province.\nDemographics.\nDuring the French colonial period, as the capital of French Indochina, Hanoi attracted a considerable number of French, Chinese and Vietnamese from the surrounding areas. In the 1940s the population of the city was 132,145. After the First Indochina War, many French and Chinese people left the city to either move south or repatriate.\nHanoi's population only started to increase rapidly in the second half 20th century. In 1954, the city had 53 thousand inhabitants, covering an area of 152\u00a0km2. By 1961, the area of the city had expanded to 584\u00a0km2, and the population was 91,000 people. In 1978, National Assembly (Vietnam) decided to expand Hanoi for the second time to 2,136\u00a0km2, with a population of 2.5\u00a0million people. By 1991, the area of Hanoi continued to change, decreasing to , but the population was still over 2 million people. During the 1990s, Hanoi's population increased steadily, reaching 2,672,122 people in 1999. After the most recent expansion in August 2008, Hanoi has a population of 6.233\u00a0million and is among the 17 capitals with the largest area in the world. According to the 2009 census, Hanoi's population is 6,451,909 people. As of 1 April 2019, Hanoi had a population of 8,053,663, including 3,991,919 males and 4,061,744 females. The population living in urban areas is 3,962,310 people, accounting for 49.2% and in rural areas is 4,091,353 people, accounting for 50.8%. Hanoi is the second most populous city in the country, after Ho Chi Minh City (8,993,082 people). The average annual population growth rate from 2009 to 2019 of Hanoi is 2.22%/year, higher than the national growth rate (1.14%/year) and is the second highest in the Red River Delta, only after B\u1eafc Ninh Province (2.90% / year).\nNowadays, the city is both a major metropolitan area of Northern Vietnam, and also the country's cultural and political centre, putting a lot of pressure on the infrastructure, some of which is antiquated and dates back to the early 20th century. It has over eight million residents within the city proper and an estimated population of 20 million within the metropolitan area.\nThe number of Hanoians who have settled down for more than three generations is likely to be very small when compared to the overall population of the city. Even in the Old Quarter, where commerce started hundreds of years ago and consisted mostly of family businesses, many of the street-front stores nowadays are owned by merchants and retailers from other provinces. The original owner family may have either rented out the store and moved into the adjoining house or moved out of the neighborhood altogether. The pace of change has especially escalated after the abandonment of central-planning economic policies and relaxing of the district-based household registrar system.\nHanoi's telephone numbers have been increased to 8 digits to cope with demand (October 2008). Subscribers' telephone numbers have been changed in a haphazard way; however, mobile phones and SIM cards are readily available in Vietnam, with pre-paid mobile phone credit available in all areas of Hanoi.\nReligion.\nThe three teachings () of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism have been the main religions of Hanoi for many years. Most people consider themselves Buddhist, though the majority of the population does not regularly follow religion, instead preferring to limit themselves to just the veneration of the dead.\nEthnic groups.\nThere are more than 50 ethnic groups in Hanoi, of which the Viet (Kinh) is the largest; according to official Vietnamese figures (2019 census), accounting for 98.66% of the population, followed by M\u01b0\u1eddng at 0.77% and T\u00e0y at 0.24%.\nEconomy.\nAccording to a recent ranking by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City will be amongst the fastest-growing cities in the world in terms of GDP growth from 2008 to 2025. In the year 2013, Hanoi contributed 12.6% to GDP, exported 7.5% of total exports, contributed 17% to the national budget and attracted 22% investment capital of Vietnam. The city's nominal GDP at current prices reached 451,213\u00a0billion VND (US$21.48\u00a0billion) in 2013, which made per capita GDP stand at 63.3\u00a0million VND (US$3,000). Industrial production in the city has experienced a rapid boom since the 1990s, with average annual growth of 19.1 percent from 1991 to 1995, 15.9 percent from 1996 to 2000, and 18.7 percent during 2001\u20132005. In addition to eight existing industrial parks, Hanoi is building five new large-scale industrial parks and 16 small- and medium-sized industrial clusters. The non-state economic sector is expanding fast, with more than 48,000 businesses operating under the Enterprise Law (as of 3/2007).\nTrade is another strong sector of the city. In 2003, Hanoi had 2,000 businesses engaged in foreign trade, having established ties with 161 countries and territories. The city's export value grew by an average 11.6 percent each year from 1996 to 2000 and 9.1 percent during 2001\u20132003. The economic structure also underwent important shifts, with tourism, finance, and banking now playing an increasingly important role. Hanoi's traditional business districts are Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm, Hai B\u00e0 Tr\u01b0ng and \u0110\u1ed1ng \u0110a; and newly developing C\u1ea7u Gi\u1ea5y, Nam T\u1eeb Li\u00eam, B\u1eafc T\u1eeb Li\u00eam, Thanh Xu\u00e2n and H\u00e0 \u0110\u00f4ng in the west.\nSimilar to Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi enjoys a rapidly developing real estate market. The most notable new urban areas are central Trung H\u00f2a Nh\u00e2n Ch\u00ednh, M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh, the luxurious zones of The Manor, Ciputra, Royal City in the Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i Street (Thanh Xu\u00e2n District) and Times City in the Hai B\u00e0 Tr\u01b0ng District. With an estimated nominal GDP of US$42.04 billion as of 2019, it is the second most productive economic area of Vietnam (after Ho Chi Minh City).\nAgriculture, previously a pillar in Hanoi's economy, has striven to reform itself, introducing new high-yield plant varieties and livestock, and applying modern farming techniques.\nAfter the economic reforms that initiated economic growth, Hanoi's appearance has also changed significantly, especially in recent years. Infrastructure is constantly being upgraded, with new roads and an improved public transportation system. Hanoi has allowed many fast-food chains into the city, such as McDonald's, Lotteria, Pizza Hut, KFC, Popeyes, Domino's Pizza, Jolibee and others. Locals in Hanoi perceive the ability to purchase \"fast-food\" as an indication of luxury and permanent fixtures. Similarly, city officials are motivated by food safety concerns and their aspirations for a \"modern\" city to replace the 67 traditional food markets with 1,000 supermarkets by 2025. This is likely to increase consumption of less nutritious foods, as traditional markets are key for consumption of fresh rather than processed foods.\nOver three-quarters of the jobs in Hanoi are state-owned. Nine percent of jobs are provided by collectively owned organizations and 13.3% of jobs are in the private sector. The structure of employment has been changing rapidly as state-owned institutions downsize and private enterprises grow. Hanoi has in-migration controls which allow the city to accept only people who add skills to Hanoi's economy. A 2006 census found that 5,600 rural produce vendors exist in Hanoi, with 90% of them coming from surrounding rural areas. These numbers indicate the much greater earning potential in urban rather than in rural spaces. The uneducated, rural, and mostly female street vendors are depicted as participants of \"microbusiness\" and local grassroots economic development by business reports. In July 2008, Hanoi's city government devised a policy to partially ban street vendors and side-walk based commerce on 62 streets due to concerns about public health and \"modernizing\" the city's image to attract foreigners. Many foreigners believe that the vendors add a traditional and nostalgic aura to the city, although street vending was much less common prior to the 1986 \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi policies. The vendors have not able to form effective resistance tactics to the ban and remain embedded in the dominant capitalist framework of modern Hanoi.\nHanoi is part of the Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast through the Strait of Malacca towards the southern tip of India to Mombasa, from there through the Red Sea via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central Europe and the North Sea.\nOn Vietnam's Provincial Competitiveness Index 2023, a key tool for evaluating the business environment in Vietnam's provinces, Hanoi received a score of 67.15. This was an improvement from 2022 in which the province received a score of 66.74. In 2023, the province received its highest scores on the 'Labor Policy' and 'Time Costs' criterion and lowest on 'Access To Land' and 'Proactivity'.\nDevelopment.\nInfrastructural development.\nA development master plan for Hanoi was designed by Ernest Hebrard in 1924, but was only partially implemented. The previous close relationship between the Soviet Union and Vietnam led to the creation of the first comprehensive plan for Hanoi with the assistance of Soviet planners between 1981 and 1984. It was never realized because it appeared to be incompatible with Hanoi's existing layout.\nIn recent years, two master plans have been created to guide Hanoi's development. The first was the Hanoi Master Plan 1990\u20132010, approved in April 1992. It was created out of collaboration between planners from Hanoi and the National Institute of Urban and Rural Planning in the Ministry of Construction. The plan's three main objectives were to create housing and a new commercial center in an area known as Ngh\u0129a \u0110\u00f4, expand residential and industrial areas in the Gia L\u00e2m District, and develop the three southern corridors linking Hanoi to H\u00e0 \u0110\u00f4ng and the Thanh Tr\u00ec District. The result of the land-use pattern was meant to resemble a five cornered star by 2010. In 1998, a revised version of the Hanoi Master plan was approved to be completed in 2020. It addressed the significant increase of population projections within Hanoi. Population densities and high rise buildings in the inner city were planned to be limited to protect the old parts of inner Hanoi. A rail transport system is planned to be built to expand public transport and link the Hanoi to surrounding areas. Projects such as airport upgrading, a golf course, and cultural villages have been approved for development by the government.\nIn the late 1980s, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Vietnamese government had designed a project to develop rural infrastructure. The project focused on improving roads, water supply and sanitation, and educational, health and social facilities because economic development in the communes and rural areas surrounding Hanoi is dependent on the infrastructural links between the rural and urban areas, especially for the sale of rural products. The project aimed to use locally available resources and knowledge such as compressed earth construction techniques for building. It was jointly funded by the UNDP, the Vietnamese government, and resources raised by the local communities and governments. In four communes, the local communities contributed 37% of the total budget. Local labor, community support, and joint funding were decided as necessary for the long-term sustainability of the project.\nCivil society development.\nPart of the goals of the \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi economic reforms was to decentralize governance for purpose of economic improvement. This led to the establishment of the first issue-oriented civic organizations in Hanoi. In the 1990s, Hanoi experienced significant poverty alleviation as a result of both the market reforms and civil society movements. Most of the civic organizations in Hanoi were established after 1995, at a rate much slower than in Ho Chi Minh City. Organizations in Hanoi are more \"tradition-bound\", focused on policy, education, research, professional interests, and appealing to governmental organizations to solve social problems. This marked difference from Ho Chi Minh's civic organizations, which practice more direct intervention to tackle social issues, may be attributed to the different societal identities of North and South Vietnam. Hanoi-based civic organizations use more systematic development and less of a direct intervention approach to deal with issues of rural development, poverty alleviation, and environmental protection. They rely more heavily on full-time staff than volunteers. In Hanoi, 16.7% of civic organizations accept anyone as a registered member and 73.9% claim to have their own budgets, as opposed to 90.9% in Ho Chi Minh City. A majority of the civic organizations in Hanoi find it difficult to work with governmental organizations. Many of the strained relations between non-governmental and governmental organizations results from statism, a bias against non-state organizations on the part of government entities.\nLandmarks.\nAs the capital of Vietnam for almost a thousand years, Hanoi is considered one of the main cultural centres of Vietnam, where most Vietnamese dynasties have left their imprint. Even though some relics have not survived through wars and time, the city still has many interesting cultural and historic monuments for visitors and residents alike. Even when the nation's capital moved to Hu\u1ebf under the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty in 1802, the city of Hanoi continued to flourish, especially after the French took control in 1888 and modeled the city's architecture to their tastes, lending an important aesthetic to the city's rich stylistic heritage. The city hosts more cultural sites than any other city in Vietnam, and boasts more than 1,000 years of history; that of the past few hundred years has been well preserved.\nOld Quarter.\nThe Old Quarter, near Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake, maintains most of the original street layout and some of the architecture of old Hanoi. At the beginning of the 20th century Hanoi consisted of the \"36 streets\", the citadel, and some of the newer French buildings south of Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm lake, most of which are now part of Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm district. Each street had merchants and households specializing in a particular trade, such as silk, jewelry or even bamboo. The street names still reflect these specializations, although few of them remain exclusively in their original commerce. The area is famous for its specializations in trades such as traditional medicine and local handicrafts, including silk shops, bamboo carpenters, and tin smiths. Local cuisine specialties as well as several clubs and bars can be found here also. A night market (near \u0110\u1ed3ng Xu\u00e2n Market) in the heart of the district opens for business every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evening with a variety of clothing, souvenirs and food.\nThe city's more than six decades of French colonization, as well as centuries of sociocultural influence from China, have influenced the designs of the old houses in Hanoi. The Franco-Chinese or hybrid architectural styles can be reflected in the front of a house in the co-existence of French-styled columns, Confucian scrolls, the Taoist yin-yang sign, and the Buddhist lotus sculpture.\nImperial sites.\nImperial sites are mostly in Ba \u0110\u00ecnh District and a bit of \u0110\u1ed1ng \u0110a District. They are juxtaposed with French colonial architecture (villas, administrative buildings and tree-lined boulevards). Some prominent edifices from feudal time include the Temple of Literature (\"V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu\"), site of the oldest university in Vietnam which was started in 1010, the One Pillar Pagoda (\"Ch\u00f9a M\u1ed9t C\u1ed9t\") which was built based on the dream of king L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng (1028\u20131054) in 1049, and the Flag Tower of Hanoi (\"C\u1ed9t c\u1edd H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i\"). In 2004, a massive part of the 900-year-old Hanoi Citadel was discovered in central Hanoi, near the site of Ba \u0110\u00ecnh Square.\nLakes.\nA city between rivers built on lowlands, Hanoi has many scenic lakes and is sometimes called the \"city of lakes\". Among its lakes, the most famous are Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake, West Lake, Tr\u00fac B\u1ea1ch Lake and B\u1ea3y M\u1eabu Lake (inside Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t Park). Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake, also known as Sword Lake, is the historical and cultural center of Hanoi, and is linked to the legend of the magic sword. West Lake (H\u1ed3 T\u00e2y) is a popular place for people to spend time. It is the largest lake in Hanoi, with many temples in the area. The lakeside road in the Nghi Tam \u2013 Quang Ba area is perfect for bicycling, jogging and viewing the cityscape or enjoying the lotus ponds in the summer. The best way to see the majestic beauty of a West Lake sunset is to view it from one of the many bars around the lake, especially from The Summit at Pan Pacific Hanoi (formally known as Summit Lounge at Sofitel Plaza Hanoi).\nColonial Hanoi.\nHanoi was the capital and the administrative center for French Indochina for most of the colonial period (from 1902 to 1945). The French colonial architectural style became dominant, and many examples remain today: tree-lined boulevards (such as Phan Dinh Phung street, Hoang Dieu street and Tran Phu street) and many villas, mansions, and government buildings. Some notable colonial structures are an eclectic mixture of French and traditional Vietnamese architectural styles, such as the National Museum of Vietnamese History, the Vietnam National Museum of Fine Arts and the old Indochina Medical College. Gouveneur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Paul Doumer (1898\u20131902) played a crucial role in colonial Hanoi's urban planning. Under his tenure there was a major construction boom.\nFrench Colonial buildings in Hanoi are mostly in Ba \u0110\u00ecnh District and Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm District, the two \"French Quarters\" of the city. Notable landmarks include:\nIn Ba \u0110\u00ecnh district:\nIn Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm district:\nMuseums.\nHanoi is home to a number of museums:\nSuburbs.\nHanoi's western suburbs, previously H\u00e0 T\u00e2y Province, offers a number of important religious sites:\nTourism.\nAccording to Mastercard's 2019 report, Hanoi is Vietnam's most visited city (15th in Asia Pacific), with 4.8\u00a0million overnight international visitors in 2018. Hanoi is sometimes dubbed the \"Paris of the East\" for its French influences. With its tree-fringed boulevards, more than two dozen lakes and thousands of French colonial-era buildings, Hanoi is a popular tourist destination.\nThe tourist destinations in Hanoi are generally grouped into two main areas: the Old Quarter and the French Quarter(s). The \"Old Quarter\" is in the northern half of Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm District with small street blocks and alleys, and a traditional Vietnamese atmosphere. Many streets in the Old Quarter have names signifying the goods (\"h\u00e0ng\") the local merchants were or are specialized in. For example, \"H\u00e0ng B\u1ea1c\" (\"silver stores\") still have many stores specializing in trading silver and jewelries. Two areas are generally called the \"French Quarters\": the governmental area in Ba \u0110\u00ecnh District and the south of Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm District. Both areas have distinctive French Colonial style villas and broad tree-lined avenues.\nThe political center of Vietnam, Ba \u0110\u00ecnh has a high concentration of Vietnamese government headquarters, including the Presidential Palace, the National Assembly Building, and several ministries and embassies, most of which used administrative buildings of colonial French Indochina. The One Pillar Pagoda, the Lyc\u00e9e du Protectorat and the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum are also in Ba Dinh.\nSouth of Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm's \"French Quarter\" has several French colonial landmarks, including the Hanoi Opera House, the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi hotel, the National Museum of Vietnamese History (formerly the \u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient), and the St. Joseph's Cathedral. Most of the French-Colonial buildings in Hoan Kiem are now used as foreign embassies. Northwest of the historic center, the Vietnam Museum of Ethnology opened in 1997, and consists of two major exhibition halls and an Architecture Garden. It is one of the most important Asian collections of traditional architecture. Since 2014, Hanoi has consistently been voted in the world's top ten destinations by TripAdvisor. It ranked eighth in 2014, fourth in 2015 and eighth in 2016. Tourism in Hanoi also faces several issues and negative aspects. The Lonely Planet website warns about situations where foreign tourists are scammed by taxis and buses into being taken to fake hotels and charged exorbitant prices. Around the Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake area, gay male tourists may be lured into karaoke bars where the bill for just a few drinks can reach $100 or more.\nHanoikids is a volunteer student group that gives international tourists free tours of Hanoi.\nEntertainment.\nA variety of options for entertainment in Hanoi can be found throughout the city. Modern and traditional theaters, cinemas, karaoke bars, dance clubs, bowling alleys, and an abundance of opportunities for shopping provide leisure activity for both locals and tourists. Hanoi has been named one of the top 10 cities for shopping in Asia by Water Puppet Tours. The number of art galleries exhibiting Vietnamese art has dramatically increased in recent years, now including galleries such as \"Nhat Huy\" of Huynh Thong Nhat. Nh\u00e0 Tri\u1ec3n L\u00e3m at 29 Hang Bai street hosts regular photo, sculpture, and paint exhibitions in conjuncture with local artists and travelling international expositions. A popular traditional form of entertainment is water puppetry, which is shown, for example, at the \"Th\u0103ng Long Water Puppet Theatre.\"\nEducation.\nHanoi, as the capital of French Indochina, was home to the first Western-style universities in Indochina, including \"Indochina Medical College\" (1902) \u2013 now Hanoi Medical University - HMU, \"Indochina University\" (1904) \u2013 now Vietnam National University - VNU (Hanoi) (the largest), and \"\u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochina\" (1925) \u2013 now Vietnam University of Fine Art - VNUFA (Hanoi).\nAfter the Communist Party of Vietnam took control of Hanoi in 1954, many new universities were built, most prominently the Hanoi University of Science and Technology. Recently ULIS (University of Languages and International Studies) was rated as one of the top universities in south-east Asia for languages and language studies at the undergraduate level. Other universities that are not part of Vietnam National University or Hanoi University include Hanoi School for Public Health, Hanoi School of Agriculture, Electric Power University and University of Transport and Communications. It is estimated that 62% of the scientists in Vietnam are living and working in Hanoi. Admission to undergraduate study is through entrance examinations, which are conducted annually and open to everyone who has successfully completed their secondary education in the country. The majority of universities in Hanoi are public, although in recent years a number of private universities have begun operation. Th\u0103ng Long University, founded in 1988 by Vietnamese mathematics professors in Hanoi and France, was the first private university in Vietnam. Because many of Vietnam's major universities are located in Hanoi, students from other provinces (especially in the northern part of the country) wishing to enter university often travel to Hanoi for the annual entrance examination. Such events usually take place in June and July, during which a large number of students and their families converge on the city for several weeks around the intense examination periods. In recent years, these entrance exams have been coordinated by the Ministry of Education, but entrance requirements are decided independently by each university.\nAlthough there are state owned kindergartens, there are also many private ventures that serve both local and international needs. Pre-tertiary (elementary and secondary) schools in Hanoi are generally state run, but there are also some independent schools. Education is equivalent to the K\u201312 system in the U.S., with elementary school between grades 1 and 5, middle school (or junior high) between grades 6 and 9, and high school from grades 10 to 12. There are several specialised schools (also known as high schools for the gifted) in Hanoi where students with the most academic prowess attend.\nEducation levels are much higher within the city of Hanoi in comparison to the suburban areas outside the city. About 33.8% of the labor force in the city has completed secondary school in contrast to 19.4% in the suburbs. 21% of the labor force in the city has completed tertiary education in contrast to 4.1% in the suburbs.\nReform.\nCountry-wide educational change is difficult in Vietnam due to the restrictive control of the government on social and economic development strategies. According to Hanoi government publications, the national system of education was reformed in 1950, 1956 and 1970. It was not until 1975 when the two separate education systems of the former North and South Vietnam territories became unified under a single national system. In Hanoi in December 1996, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam stated that: \"To carry out industrialization and modernization successfully, it is necessary to develop education and training strongly [and to] maximize human resources, the key factor of fast and sustained development.\"\nTransportation.\nHanoi has 1,370 streets and roads with the total length of over ; 573 bridges, of which 483 small to middle bridges, 13 light overpasses for vehicles, 70 pedestrian overpasses and seven main bridges (Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng, V\u0129nh Tuy, Thanh Tr\u00ec, Nh\u1eadt T\u00e2n, \u0110\u00f4ng Tr\u00f9, Th\u0103ng Long, and Ph\u00f9ng); 115 tunnels, including nine main tunnels, 39 pedestrian tunnels and 67 underpass. In total, the proportion of land for traffic in the city as of 2021 is 10.3%. The city also has of inland waterways, which include Y\u1ebfn stream, Hai stream, C\u00e0 L\u1ed3 and \u0110\u00e1y river.\nHanoi is served by Noi Bai International Airport, located in Soc Son District, approximately north of Hanoi. The new international terminal (T2), designed and built by Japanese contractors, opened in January 2015 and is a big facelift for the airport. In addition, a new highway and the new Nhat Tan cable-stay bridge connecting the airport and the city center opened at the same time, offering much more convenience than the old road (via Thang Long bridge). Taxis are plentiful and usually have meters, although it is also common to agree on the trip price before taking a taxi from the airport to the city centre.\nHanoi is also the origin or departure point for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country with 6 national railway lines passing through the city with a total length of . The Reunification Express (t\u00e0u Th\u1ed1ng Nh\u1ea5t) runs from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City from Hanoi station (formerly Hang Co station), with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Trains also depart Hanoi frequently for Hai Phong and other northern cities. The Reunification Express line was established during the French colonial rule and was completed over a period of nearly 40 years, from 1899 to 1936. The Reunification Express between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City covers a distance of and takes approximately 33 hours. As of 2005, there were 278 stations on the Vietnamese railway network, of which 191 were located along the north\u2013south line.\nThe main means of transport within Hanoi are motorbikes, buses, taxis, and a rising number of cars. In recent decades, motorbikes have overtaken bicycles as the main form of transportation. Cars are the most notable change in the past five years as many Vietnamese people have started to purchase them for the first time. The increasing number of cars is the main cause of gridlocks, as roads and infrastructure in older parts of Hanoi were not designed to accommodate them. On 4 July 2017, the Hanoi government voted to ban motorbikes entirely by 2030 to reduce pollution, congestion, and encourage the expansion and use of public transport. The number of vehicles registered in Hanoi as of July 2022 is over 7.6 million, including more than 1 million cars, over 6.4 million motorcycles of and 179,000 electric motorbikes. This figure does not include vehicles of the armed forces, diplomatic missions and other localities' vehicles operating in Hanoi.\nPeople on their own or traveling in a pair who wish to make a fast trip around Hanoi to avoid traffic jams or to travel at an irregular time or by way of an irregular route often use \"xe \u00f4m\" (literally, \"hug bike\"). Motorbikes can also be rented from agents within the Old Quarter of Hanoi, although this falls inside a grey legal area.\nThere are two metro lines in Hanoi, as part of the master plan for the future Hanoi Metro system.

{"id": "56668", "revid": "1318228742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56668", "title": "Apricot", "text": "Cultivated fruit\nAn apricot (, ) is a fruit, or the tree that bears the fruit, of several species in the genus \"Prunus\". Usually an apricot is from the species \"Prunus armeniaca\", but the fruits of the other species in \"Prunus\" sect. \"Armeniaca\" are also called apricots. In 2023, world production of apricots was 3.7 million tonnes, led by Turkey with 20% of the total.\n\"Prunus armeniaca\" was domesticated in ancient times in Central Asia and China. Cultivation of the tree then spread across Eurasia and to North Africa and Japan. The fruit is consumed both fresh and dried. Apricots are used in dishes including cakes, tarts, and jam, and in savoury dishes, for example in stuffing. In Austria, they are the basis of \"Marillenkn\u00f6del\", sweet apricot dumplings.\nEtymology.\n\"Apricot\" first appeared in English in the 16th century as \"abrecock\" from the Middle French or later , from Spanish \"albaricoque\" and Catalan , in turn from Arabic \u200e (, 'the plums'), from Byzantine Greek (, 'apricot tree'), derived from late Greek (, 'apricot') from Latin [ ('peach')] (, 'early ripening').\nDescription.\nThe apricot is a small tree, up to tall, with a round canopy and a spread similar to its height. The flowers are white or pinkish, about wide, appearing before the leaves early in the spring. The fruit is a succulent orange-yellow drupe (a stonefruit) tinged with red. The single seed (kernel or stone) is enclosed in a hard shell (exocarp).\nTaxonomy.\nApricots are species belonging to \"Prunus\" sect. \"Armeniaca\". The taxonomic position of \"P. brigantina\" is disputed. It is grouped with plum species according to chloroplast DNA sequences, but more closely related to apricot species according to nuclear DNA sequences.\nCultivation.\nOrigin and domestication.\nThe most commonly cultivated apricot \"Prunus armeniaca\" was known in Armenia during ancient times, and has been cultivated there for so long that it was previously thought to have originated there, hence the epithet of its scientific name. However, this is not supported by genetic studies, which instead confirm the hypothesis proposed by Nikolai Vavilov that domestication of \"P. armeniaca\" occurred in Central Asia and China. The domesticated apricot then diffused south to South Asia, west to West Asia (including Armenia), Europe and North Africa, and east to Japan.\nCultivation practices.\nApricots have a chilling requirement of 300 to 900 chilling units. A dry climate is good for fruit maturation. The tree is slightly more cold-hardy than the peach, tolerating winter temperatures as cold as or lower if healthy, with large differences between cultivars. They are hardy in USDA zones 5 through 8. A limiting factor in apricot culture is spring frosts: They tend to flower very early (in early March in western Europe), and spring frost can kill flowers or before flower buds in different stages of development. Furthermore, the trees are sensitive to temperature changes during the winter season. In China, winters can be very cold, but temperatures tend to be more stable than in Europe and especially North America, where large temperature swings can occur in winter. Hybridization with the closely related \"Prunus sibirica\" (Siberian apricot; hardy to but with less palatable fruit) offers options for breeding more cold-tolerant plants. They prefer well-drained soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0.\nApricot cultivars are usually grafted onto plum or peach rootstocks. The cultivar scion provides the fruit characteristics, such as flavor and size, but the rootstock provides the growth characteristics of the plant. Some of the more popular US apricot cultivars are 'Blenheim', 'Wenatchee Moorpark', 'Tilton', and 'Perfection'. Some apricot cultivars are self-compatible, so do not require pollinizer trees; others are not: 'Moongold' and 'Sungold', for example, must be planted in pairs so they can pollinate each other.\nPlant breeders have created what is known as a \"black apricot\" or \"purple apricot\", (\"Prunus dasycarpa\"), a hybrid of an apricot and the cherry plum (\"Prunus cerasifera\"). Other apricot\u2013plum hybrids are variously called plumcots, apriplums, pluots, or apriums.\nPests and diseases.\nDiseases of apricots vary with climate. In California's hot Central Valley, pit burn, a condition of soft and brown fruit around the pit, is common. Bacterial diseases include bacterial spot and crown gall. Fungal diseases include brown rot caused by \"Monilinia fructicola\" late in the season. In periods of heavy rain, the flowers can suffer from blossom wiltwhere the flowers and young shoots turn brown and die; the twigs die back in a severe attack. Dieback of branches in the summer around pruning wounds can be caused by the fungus \"Eutypa lata\". Other fungal diseases are black knot, \"Alternaria\" spot and fruit rot, and powdery mildew. Unlike peaches, apricots are not affected by leaf curl, and bacterial canker (causing sunken patches in the bark, which then spread and kill the affected branch or tree) and silver leaf are not serious threats, which means that pruning in late winter is considered safe.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nProduction.\nIn 2023, world production of apricots was 3.7 million tonnes, led by Turkey with 20% of the total (table). Other major producers (in descending order) were Uzbekistan, Iran, Italy, and Algeria. \nMalatya is the center of Turkey's apricot industry.\nToxicity.\nApricot kernels (seeds) contain amygdalin, a poisonous compound. On average, bitter apricot kernels contain about 5% amygdalin and sweet kernels about 0.9% amygdalin. These values correspond to 0.3% and 0.05% of cyanide. Since a typical apricot kernel weighs 600\u00a0mg, bitter and sweet varieties contain, respectively, 1.8 and 0.3\u00a0mg of cyanide.\nUses.\nFruit.\nFresh apricots can be cooked in dishes such as cakes and tarts, or made into jam. Dried apricots can be used in similar ways, and included in stuffing for meat dishes, stews, granola, and muesli. In Austrian cuisine, \"Marillenkn\u00f6del\" are dumplings stuffed with apricots, garnished with breadcrumbs fried in butter and dusted with sugar. In Mediterranean cuisine, a cooling drink is made by dissolving apricot paste in water. Barack is a Hungarian apricot brandy.\nKernel.\nDue to their natural amygdalin content, culinary uses for the kernel are limited because of the risk of cyanide poisoning. Oil made from apricot kernels is safe for human consumption without treatment because amygdalin is not oil soluble. Ground up shells are used in cosmetics as an exfoliant. As an exfoliant, it provides an alternative to plastic microbeads.\nThe kernels can be made into a plant milk.\nNutrition.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nA raw apricot is 86% water, 11% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and less than 1% fat (table). In a reference amount of , a raw apricot supplies 48 Calories and is a moderate source of vitamin A and vitamin C (11% each of the Daily Value, DV), with no other micronutrients in significant content (less than 10% DV, table).\nPhytochemicals.\nApricots contain phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, including catechins and chlorogenic acid. Taste and aroma compounds include sucrose, glucose, organic acids, terpenes, aldehydes and lactones.\nDried apricots.\nDried apricots are a type of traditional dried fruit. Dried apricots are 31% water, 63% carbohydrates, 4% protein, and contain negligible fat (table). When the water content of apricots is decreased by drying, the mass fraction of micronutrients is increased, such as for vitamin A, vitamin E, and potassium, each having higher contents than in raw fruit (DVs above 20%, table).\nIn culture.\nThe apricot is the national fruit of Armenia, mostly growing in the Ararat plain. It is often depicted on souvenirs.\nThe Chinese associate the apricot with education and medicine. For instance, the classical word \u674f \u58c7 (literally: \"apricot altar\") (x\u00ecng t\u00e1n \u674f\u575b) which means \"educational circle\", is still widely used in written language. Zhuangzi, a Chinese philosopher in the fourth century BC, told a story that Confucius taught his students in a forum surrounded by the wood of apricot trees. The association with medicine in turn comes from the common use of apricot kernels as a component in traditional Chinese medicine, and from the story of Dong Feng (\u8463\u5949), a physician during the Three Kingdoms period, who required no payment from his patients except that they plant apricot trees in his orchard upon recovering from their illnesses, resulting in a large grove of apricot trees and a steady supply of medicinal ingredients. \nThe short and unreliable apricot season in Egypt has given rise to the common Egyptian Arabic and Palestinian Arabic expression \"filmishmish\" (\"in apricot [season]\") or \"bukra filmishmish\" (\"tomorrow in apricot [season]\"), uttered as a riposte to an unlikely prediction, or as a rash promise to fulfill a request.\nIn Middle Eastern and North African cuisines, apricots are used to make Qamar al-Din (lit. \"Moon of the faith\"), a thick apricot drink that is a popular fixture at Iftar during Ramadan. Qamar al-Din is believed to originate in Damascus, Syria, where the variety of apricots most suitable for the drink was first grown. In Jewish culture, apricots are eaten as part of the Tu BiShvat seder.\nIn the U.S. Marines it is considered exceptionally bad luck to eat or possess apricots, especially near tanks.This superstition has been documented since at least the Vietnam War and is often cited as originating in World War II. Even calling them by their name is considered unlucky, so they are instead called \"cots\", \"Forbidden fruit\" or \"A-fruit\".\nAmerican astronauts ate dried apricot on the Apollo 15 and Apollo 17 missions to the moon.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The city proper has an area of , a population of 1,849,600 as of the 2022 census, and an estimated 2,487,209 people in its metropolitan province. The city is situated in north-eastern Zimbabwe in the country's Mashonaland region. Harare Metropolitan Province incorporates the city and the municipalities of Chitungwiza, Epworth and Ruwa. The city sits on a plateau at an elevation of above sea level, and its climate falls into the subtropical highland category.\nThe city was founded in 1890 by the Pioneer Column, a small military force of the British South Africa Company, and was named Fort Salisbury after the British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury. Company administrators demarcated the city and ran it until Southern Rhodesia achieved responsible government in 1923. Salisbury was thereafter the seat of the Southern Rhodesian (later Rhodesian) government and, between 1953 and 1963, the capital of the Central African Federation. It retained the name Salisbury until 1982 when it was renamed Harare on the second anniversary of Zimbabwe's independence from the United Kingdom. The national parliament moved out of Harare upon completion of the New Parliament of Zimbabwe in Mount Hampden in April 2022.\nBeing the commercial capital of Zimbabwe, it remains an important center of commerce and government, as well as finance, real estate, manufacturing, healthcare, education, art, culture, tourism, agriculture, mining and regional affairs. Harare has the second-highest number of embassies in Southern Africa and situates the African headquarters of the World Health Organization, along with Brazzaville.\nHarare has hosted multiple international conferences and events, including the 1995 All-Africa Games and the 2003 Cricket World Cup. In 2018, Harare was ranked as a Gamma World City. It is also home to Dynamos FC, the club with the most titles in Zimbabwean football.\nHistory.\nEarly colonial history.\nThe Pioneer Column, a military volunteer force of settlers organized by Cecil Rhodes, founded the city on 12 September 1890 as a fort. They originally named the city Fort Salisbury after The 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, then-Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and it subsequently became known simply as Salisbury. The Salisbury Polo Club was formed in 1896. Salisbury was declared a municipality in 1897, and it became a city in 1935.\nAt the time of the city's founding, its site and surroundings were poorly drained. The earliest development was on sloping ground along the left bank of a stream, in an area where the Julius Nyerere Way industrial road runs today. The first area to be fully drained was near the head of the stream and was named Causeway. Causeway is now the site of many important government buildings, including the Senate House and the Office of the Prime Minister. After the position was abolished in January 1988, the office was renamed for the use of the President.\nSalisbury was the seat of the British South Africa Company administrator and became the capital of the self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia in 1923.\nPost-war period.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, Salisbury expanded rapidly, boosted by its designation as the capital of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. This growth ushered in a wave of liberalism, investment and developmentalism from 1953 to 1963, transforming the city's skyline in the process. This was accompanied by significant post-war immigration by White people, primarily from Great Britain, Southern Africa and, to a lesser extent, Southern Europe. According to the US Department of State, more than half of white Zimbabweans arrived in Zimbabwe after WW2. The rapid rise of motor vehicle ownership and the investment in road development greatly accelerated the outward sprawl of suburbs such as Alexandra Park and Mount Pleasant. At the same time, mostly black suburbs like Highfield suffered from overcrowding as their populations boomed.\nThe optimism and prosperity of this period proved to be short-lived, as the Federation collapsed, which hindered the city's prosperity.\n1960s and 1970s.\nThe Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was dissolved in 1963. Ian Smith's Rhodesian Front government declared Rhodesia independent from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965, with Salisbury retained as the capital. Smith's Rhodesia later became the short-lived state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia; it was not until 18 April 1980 that the country was internationally recognized as independent as the Republic of Zimbabwe.\nPost-independence years.\nThe city initially boomed under a wave of optimism and investment that followed the country's independence in 1980. The name of the city was changed to Harare on 18 April 1982, the second anniversary of Zimbabwean independence, taking its name from the village near Harare Kopje of the Shona chief Neharawa, whose nickname was \"he who does not sleep\". Before independence, \"Harare\" was the name of the black residential area now known as Mbare.\nSignificant investment in education and healthcare produced a confident and growing middle class, evidenced by the rise of firms such as Econet Global and innovative design and architecture, exemplified by the Eastgate Centre. A notable symbol of this era in Harare's history is the New Reserve Bank Tower, one of the city's major landmarks.\nHarare was the location of several international summits during this period, such as the 8th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in September 1986 and the 1991 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. The latter produced the Harare Declaration, dictating the membership criteria of the Commonwealth. In 1998, Harare was the host city of the 8th Assembly of the World Council of Churches.\nHowever, by 1992, Harare began to experience an economic downturn and the government responded by enacting neoliberal reforms. These policies provoked a boom in banking, finance and agriculture, but also led to significant job losses in manufacturing, thereby greatly increasing unemployment and income inequality. Domestic firms struggled to compete with imports, leading to the collapse of several institutions, particularly in the textile industry.\nEconomic difficulties and hyperinflation (1999\u20132008).\nIn the early 21st century, Harare was adversely affected by the political and economic crises that plagued Zimbabwe, particularly following the contested 2002 presidential election and 2005 parliamentary elections. The elected council was replaced by a government-appointed commission due to alleged inefficiency. Still, essential services such as rubbish collection and street repairs rapidly worsened, and are now virtually non-existent in poorer parts of the city. In May 2006, the Zimbabwean newspaper \"Financial Gazette\" described the city in an editorial as a \"sunshine city-turned-sewage farm\". In 2009, Harare was voted the world's toughest city to live in according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's livability poll, which factors in stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education, and infrastructure. The situation was unchanged in 2011, according to the same poll.\nOperation Murambatsvina.\nIn May 2005, the Zimbabwean government demolished shanties, illegal vending sites, and backyard cottages in Harare, Epworth and other cities in Operation Murambatsvina (\"Drive Out Trash\"). It was widely alleged that the true purpose of the campaign was to make sure shanty towns would not develop in any urban areas that might favor the Movement for Democratic Change, and to reduce the likelihood of mass action against the government by driving people out of the cities. The government claimed its actions were necessitated by a rise of criminality and disease. This was followed by Operation Garikayi/Hlalani Kuhle (Operation \"Better Living\") a year later, which consisted of building poor-quality concrete housing.\nEconomic uncertainty.\nIn late March 2010, Harare's Joina City Tower was finally opened after fourteen years of delayed construction, marketed as 'Harare's New Pride'. Initially, uptake of space in the tower was low, with office occupancy at only 3% in October 2011. By May 2013, office occupancy had risen to around half, with all the retail space occupied.\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit rated Harare as the world's least livable city (out of 140 surveyed) in February 2011, rising to 137th out of 140 in August 2012.\nIn March 2015, Harare City Council planned a two-year project to install 4,000 solar street lights, starting in the central business district, at a cost of $15,000,000.\nIn November 2017, the biggest demonstration in the history of the Republic of Zimbabwe was held in Harare, which led to the forced resignation of the long-serving 93-year-old President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, an event which was part of the first successful coup in Zimbabwe.\nContemporary Harare.\nSince 2000, Harare has experienced periods of spectacular decline, particularly in the 2000s, but since the Great Recession it has stabilised and experienced significant population growth and uneven economic growth. There has nonetheless been substantial international investment and speculation in the city's financial and property markets. Development on the urban fringes of the city has occurred in areas such as Borrowdale, Glen Lorne, The Grange, Mount Pleasant Heights, as well as in the new suburbs of Hogerty Hill, Shawasha Hills, Bloomingdale and Westlea. Urban sprawl has also expanded into the nearby areas of Mount Hampden, Ruwa and Norton. In addition, inner city areas such as Avondale, Eastlea, Belgravia, Newlands and Milton Park have seen increased gentrification driven by speculation from expat Zimbabweans. This speculation has also attracted other foreign buyers, resulting in high property prices and widespread rent increases. Harare sustained the highest population increase and urban development of any major Zimbabwean city since 2000, with other cities such as Bulawayo, Gweru, and Mutare largely stagnating during the same period.\nBeginning in 2006, the city's growth extended into its northern and western fringes, beyond the city's urban growth boundary. Predictions that by 2025 the metropolitan area population will reach 4 to 5 million have sparked concerns over unchecked sprawl and unregulated development. The concentration of real estate development in Harare has also come at the expense of other Zimbabwean cities such as Gweru and particularly Bulawayo, which is increasingly characterized by stagnation and high unemployment due to the collapse of many of its heavy industries. Today, Harare's property market remains highly priced, more so than regional cities such as Johannesburg and Cape Town. The top end of the market is completely dominated by wealthy or dual-citizen Zimbabweans (see Zimbabwean diaspora and Zimbabweans in the United Kingdom), Chinese and South African buyers. Despite gentrification and speculation, the country's and city's unemployment rates remain high.\nIn 2020, Harare was classified as a Gamma city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;As of 2012, Harare has a population of 2,123,132. Over 90% of people in Harare are Shona-speaking people of African descent. Harare is also home to many Ndebele and Kalanga people as well. Many white Zimbabweans also live in the Harare metropolitan area.\nGeography.\nTopography.\nThe city sits on one of the higher parts of the Highveld plateau of Zimbabwe at an elevation of . The original landscape could be described as a \"parkland\" or wild place. The soils of Harare are varied: the northern and central areas largely have reddish brown, granular clay; some of the southern parts have gray-brown sand over pale, loamy sand or sandy loam.\nSuburbs.\nThe City of Harare is divided into suburbs, outside of which are independent municipalities such as Epworth, Mount Hampden, Norton, Ruwa, and Chitungwiza, which are still located within the greater metropolitan province.\nThe central business district of Harare is characterized by wide streets and a mix of historic, post-war, and modern buildings. Downtown sights include the Kopje Africa Unity Square, the Harare Gardens, the National Gallery, the August House parliamentary buildings, and the National Archives. Causeway, a road and sub-neighbourhood of central Harare, is a busy workaday area that acts as the city's \"embassy row\" (along with Belgravia to the north-east) in which numerous embassies, diplomatic missions, research institutes, and other international organizations are concentrated. Additionally, many government ministries and museums, such as the Zimbabwe Museum of Human Sciences, are located here.\nRotten Row is a sub-district of downtown Harare that begins at the intersection of Prince Edward Street and Samora Machel Avenue and runs to the flyover where it borders Mbare on Cripps Road. Rotten Row was named after a road in London of the same name. The name \"Rotten Row\" is an altered form of the French phrase \"Route du Roi,\" the King's Road. It is known as Harare's legal district, home to the Harare Magistrate's Court, the city's central library, and the ZANU-PF building, along with numerous law offices. The neighbourhood also lends its name to the eponymous book by Petina Gappah published in 2016.\nThe northern and north-eastern suburbs of Harare are generally home to its more affluent residents, including former president Robert Mugabe, who lived in Borrowdale Brooke. These northern suburbs are often referred to as \"dales\" because of the common suffix \"-dale\" found in some suburbs such as Avondale, Greendale, and Borrowdale. The dwellings are mostly low-density homes of 3 bedrooms or more, and these are usually occupied by families. Borrowdale in particular is home to some of the most extensive real estate developments in the city. The north-western suburb of Emerald Hill is named so either due to the green colour of the tree-covered hill or its Irish connections \u2014 many of the roads in the suburb have Irish names, such as Dublin, Belfast, Wicklow, and Cork.\nTo the east of Harare's city center, notable suburbs include Arcadia, Newlands, Arlington, and others. Newlands was named by Colin Duff, Zimbabwe's agricultural secretary in the 1920s. Arlington is a newer suburb adjacent to Harare International Airport and was previously owned by William Harvey Brown, a former mayor of Salisbury. Brown was originally from Iowa and joined the occupying British South Africa Company forces in the 1890s to collect specimens for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.\nThe southern portions of Harare have historically been more industrial areas, often home to most of its African population as well as some lower-class European-descended populations. Willowvale, is perhaps best known for the 1988 Willowgate scandal, which implicated several members of the ZANU-PF party in a scheme where automobiles were illegally resold by various government officials. Harare's south-west also contains many high-density townships, which were set up by the government from the 1930s onwards. For example, Highfield, established in 1930, is the second-oldest high-density suburb in Harare. Highfield was created as a place for black workers to settle, providing labor for the industrial areas of Southerton and Workington.\nClimate.\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Harare has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cwb\"), an oceanic climate variety. Because the city is situated on a plateau, its high altitude and cool south-easterly airflow cause it to have a climate that is cooler and drier than a tropical or subtropical climate.\nThe average annual temperature is , rather low for the tropics. This is due to its high altitude position and the prevalence of cool south-easterly airflow.\nThere are three main seasons: a warm, wet summer from November to March/April; a cool, dry winter from May to August (corresponding to winter in the Southern Hemisphere); and a warm to hot, dry season in September/October. Daily temperature ranges are about in July (the coldest month), about in October (the hottest month) and about in January (midsummer). The hottest year on record was October 26, 2011 with and the coldest year was 1965 with .\nThe average annual rainfall is about in the southwest, rising to on the higher land of the northeast (from around Borrowdale to Glen Lorne). Very little rain typically falls during the period of May to September, although sporadic showers occur most years. Rainfall varies a great deal from year to year and follows cycles of wet and dry periods from 7 to 10 years long. Records begin in October 1890 but all three Harare stations stopped reporting in early 2004.\nThe climate supports the natural vegetation of open woodland. The most common tree of the local region is the msasa or \"Brachystegia spiciformis\" whose wine-red leaves are most visible in the city in late August. Two introduced species of trees, the jacaranda and the flamboyant from South America and Madagascar respectively, were introduced during the colonial era and contribute to the city's colour palette with their lilac and red blossoms. The two species flower in October/November and are planted on alternating streets in the capital. Bougainvillea is prevalent in Harare as well. Some trees from Northern Hemisphere middle latitudes are also cultivated, including American sweetgum, English oak, Japanese oak and Spanish oak.\nEconomy.\nHarare is Zimbabwe's leading financial, commercial, and communications centre, as well as an international trade centre for tobacco, maize, cotton, and citrus fruits. Manufacturing of products including textiles, steel, and chemicals is also economically significant, as is the trade of precious minerals such as gold, diamonds and platinum. Early investor optimism following the inauguration of the Mnangagwa government in 2017 has since largely subsided due to the slow pace of reforms aimed at making Harare and Zimbabwe more business-friendly. The economy suffered high inflation and frequent power outages in 2019, which further hampered investment, and the poor implementation of adequate monetary reforms alongside deficit reduction attempts had a similar effect. Although the government has repeatedly stressed its commitments to improving transparency, increasing the ease of doing business, and fighting corruption, progress remains limited under the Mnangagwa administration.\nHarare experienced a real estate boom in the 2000s and early 2010s, particularly in the wealthy northern suburbs, with prices rising dramatically over the last decade despite challenges in other sectors of the economy. This boom was largely fueled by members of the Zimbabwean diaspora and by speculation, with investors hedging against the local currency. However, the once-growing market began to cool off due to a 2019 hike in interest rates and the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving a number of projects unfinished.\nAnother challenge to Harare's economy is the persistent emigration of highly educated and skilled residents to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand, largely due to the economic downturn and political unrest. The city's brain drain, almost unprecedented compared to other emerging markets, has led to declining numbers of local entrepreneurs, an overstretched and declining middle class, and a dearth of employment opportunities outside the informal and public sector. In addition, the city's working-class residents are increasingly moving to nearby South Africa and Botswana, though they are readily replaced by less well-off rural migrants. However, despite over a decade of neglect, the city's infrastructure and human capital still compares favourably with cities in other parts of Africa and Latin America. It remains to be seen whether the current government can entice its diverse and well-educated Zimbabwean diaspora, numbering some 4 to 7 million people, to invest in the economy, let alone consider returning.\nShopping and retail.\nLocally produced art, handicrafts and souvenirs can be purchased at locations including Doon Estate, Uwminsdale, Avondale Market and Mbare Musika. Msasa Park and Umwinsdale in particular host a number of galleries that produce high-quality Shona soapstone sculptures and textiles, such as Patrick Mavros Studios, which has another gallery in Knightsbridge, London. International brands are generally less common in Harare than in European cities. However, conventional and luxury shopping can be found on Fife Avenue, Sam Nujoma (Union) Avenue, Arundel Village, Avondale, Borrowdale, Eastgate, Westgate and Sam Levy's Village. Virtually all luxury shopping is concentrated in the wealthier northern suburbs, particularly Borrowdale.\nTransportation.\nHarare is a relatively young city, mostly growing during the country's post-Federation and post-independence booms. It was also segregated along racial and class lines until 1976. As a result, Harare today is a mostly low-density urban area geared towards private motorists, lacking a convenient public transportation system. Very little investment has been made to develop an effective and integrated public transportation system, leaving a significant number of the city's residents dependent on the city's informal minibus taxis. The rise of local ridesharing apps such as GTaxi and Hwindi has partly eased pressure on the city's transportation system, but such rides are still too expensive for most working people to use. In addition, bus services are also available but they are mostly geared towards intercity travel and recreation than journeys within Harare itself.\nThe city's public transport system includes public and private sector operations. The former consists of ZUPCO buses. Privately owned public transport included licensed station wagons (nicknamed 'emergency taxis') until 1993, when the government began to replace them with licensed buses and minibuses, referred to officially as 'commuter omnibuses'. Harare has two kinds of taxis, metered taxis and the much more ubiquitous share taxis or 'kombis'. Unlike many other cities, metered taxis generally do not drive around the city looking for passengers and instead must be called and ordered to a destination. The minibus \"taxis\" are the de facto day-to-day form of transport relied upon by the majority of Harare's population.\nAs of May 2023, Harare is not served by any passenger rail service. The National Railways of Zimbabwe previously operated daily overnight passenger train services to Mutare and Bulawayo using the Beira\u2013Bulawayo railway. Long-distance rail service was suspended in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and has not been restarted. Between 2001 and 2006, three commuter rail routes operated in Harare, serving Tynwald, Mufakose and Ruwa. These commuter rail routes, nicknamed 'Freedom Trains', were reintroduced in 2021, but were suspended again in November 2022 due to payment disputes with ZUPCO.\nLong-distance bus services link Harare to most parts of Zimbabwe.\nThe city is crossed by Transafrican Highway 9 (TAH 9), which connects it to the cities of Lusaka and Beira.\nThe largest airport in Zimbabwe, the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport, serves Harare.\nEducation.\nThe University of Zimbabwe is located in Harare. Founded in 1952, the university is the country's oldest and largest, offering a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate programs. The student population stands at 20,399, with 17,718 undergraduate students and 2,681 postgraduate students.\nSports.\nHarare has long been regarded as Zimbabwe's sporting capital due to its role in developing Zimbabwean sport, the range and quality of its sporting events and venues, and its high rates of spectatorship and participation. The city is also home to more professional sports teams competing at the national and international levels than any other Zimbabwean city. Football is the most popular sport in Harare, particularly among working-class residents, with the city producing many footballers who have gone on to play in the English Premier League and elsewhere. Cricket and rugby are also popular sports with those from middle-class backgrounds.\nIn 1995, Harare hosted most of the sixth All-Africa Games, sharing the event with other Zimbabwean cities such as Bulawayo and Chitungwiza. It hosted some of the matches of 2003 Cricket World Cup, which was hosted jointly by Kenya, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Harare also hosted the ICC Cricket 2018 World Cup Qualifier matches in March 2018.\nHarare is home to Harare Sports Club Ground, which hosts many Test, One Day Internationals and T20I Cricket matches. The Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League clubs of Dynamos F.C., Black Rhinos F.C., and CAPS United F.C. also call the city home.\nHarare's main stadiums are National Sports Stadium and Rufaro Stadium.\nPopular teams.\nThe following table shows the major sports teams in the Harare area.\n \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootball and cricket\nThe main football stadiums in Harare are the National Sports Stadium and Rufaro Stadium.\nVirtually all first-class and international cricket matches are hosted at Harare Sports Club, with most domestic tours occurring in spring and summer. This city is also home to the Mashonaland Eagles in the domestic Logan Cup tournament. The Eagles are coached by renowned former Zimbabwe national cricket team batsman Grant Flower. The team are one of the country's strongest sides and last won the Logan Cup in the 2022-23 Logan Cup season.\nRugby\nHarare is also the heartland of rugby union in Zimbabwe, rivalling Windhoek in Namibia as the strongest rugby region in Africa beyond South Africa. The governing Rhodesia Rugby Football Union was founded in Harare in 1895 and became the Zimbabwe Rugby Union in 1980. The union and national sides are based in the northern suburb of Alexandra Park. Harare is home to four of the country's national Super Six Rugby League (SSRL) clubs: Harare Sports Club, Old Georgians, Old Hararians and Old Miltonians. Additionally, the Zimbabwe Rugby Academy, the national development side which plays in the second division of the Currie Cup, is largely made up of players from the city. International rugby test matches tend to be hosted at Harare Sports Club, the Police Grounds, and at Hartsfield in Bulawayo, with a particularly strong rivalry with the Namibia national rugby union team. Traditionally the city hosted tours by the British and Irish Lions, Argentina, and the All-Blacks on their respective tours of South Africa. However, this is no longer the case, due to the end of traditional rugby tours and the Zimbabwe national rugby union team's decline in the international rugby rankings. Wales was the last major country to tour Harare, visiting in 1993.\nHigh school teams are generally of a high standard, with Prince Edward School, St. George's College, and St. John's College all ranking among the country's leading teams and frequently sending their first XV sides to compete against well-known South African high schools during Craven Week. After high school, the city's best players unfortunately tend to move on to South Africa or the United Kingdom due to a lack of professionalism and greater educational and earning opportunities abroad, thus depleting the strength of the rugby union in Zimbabwe. Notable internationals hailing from Harare include Tendai Mtawarira, Don Armand, and Brian Mujati, among numerous others.\nMedia.\nHarare is host to some of Zimbabwe's leading media outlets. Despite accusations of government censorship and intimidation, the city maintains a robust press, much of which is defiantly critical of the current government. In print media, the most internationally-famous paper is the \"Herald\", the city's oldest newspaper, founded in 1893 and former paper of record prior to its purchase by the government. The paper is best noted for its heavy censorship during the Rhodesian Front government from 1962 to 1979, with many of its articles appearing as redacted \u2014 with black boxes marking the words removed by government censors \u2014 before its forced purchase. Today it is largely seen as little more than a government mouthpiece by residents and overwhelmingly supports the government line.\nIn contrast, private newspapers continue to adopt a more independent line and enjoy a diverse and vibrant readership. These include the Financial Gazette, the financial paper of record which is nicknamed 'the Pink Press' for its tradition of printing on a pink broadsheet. Other newspapers include: the \"Zimbabwe Independent\", a centre-left newspaper and \"de facto\" paper of record noted for its investigative journalism; the \"Standard\", a centre-left Sunday paper; \"NewsDay\", a left-wing tabloid; \"H-Metro\", a mass-market tabloid; the \"Daily News\", a left wing opposition paper; and \"Kwayedza\", the leading Shona language newspaper in Zimbabwe.\nOnline media outlets include \"ZimOnline\", \"ZimDaily\", the \"Zimbabwe Guardian\" and \"NewZimbabwe.com\" amongst others.\nTelevision and radio.\nThe state-owned ZBC TV maintains a monopoly on free-to-air TV channels in the city, with private broadcasters (such as the now-defunct Joy TV) coming and going based on the whims of the government. As such, many households that can afford the cost subscribe to the satellite television distributor DStv for entertainment, news, and sport from Africa and abroad.\nIn November 2021, it was announced that six new free-to-air private television stations would go live in Zimbabwe and join ZBC TV after the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe issued licences, ending the 64-year monopoly enjoyed by the state-owned broadcaster. Zimpapers Television Network, a subsidiary of diversified media group Zimbabwe Newspapers Ltd, was one of the channels awarded a free-to-air television licence. The other five were NRTV, 3K TV, Kumba TV, Ke Yona TV, and Channel Dzimbahwe.\nHarare is also well served by radio, with a number of the country's leading radio stations maintaining a presence in the city. There are currently four state-controlled Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation channels (SFM, Radio Zimbabwe, Power FM and National FM), as well as private national commercial free-to-air stations such as Star FM, Capital 100.4 FM, and ZiFM. In addition, Channel Zim (an alternative satellite channel) and VOA Zimbabwe both broadcast via inexpensive free-to-air decoders. Eight newly licensed local commercial stations have been commissioned, but were not yet on air as of 2020.\nCommercial stations tend to show similar trends in programming, with high percentages of music, talk radio or phone-in programs, and sports, with only infrequent news bulletins. Despite the country's 16 official languages, virtually all broadcasts occur in English, Shona, and Ndebele.\nCulture.\nHarare has a strong cultural and artistic scene that often responds to ongoing economic and political crises, offering opportunities for satire, experimentation, and reinvention. While authors and musicians such as Doris Lessing, Petina Gappah and Thomas Mapfumo have long criticized the corruption and shortcomings of the Smith and Mugabe governments, the emergence of protest and critical theatre since 2000 has invigorated the local arts scene. Actors, directors and artists have joined musicians and writers in criticizing political maleficence and audiences have rallied behind them, making the local theatre and art scene one of the most vibrant in the southern hemisphere.\nThe city is also the site of the Harare International Festival of the Arts (HIFA), which has featured such acclaimed artists as Cape Verdean singer Sara Tavares. HIFA was cancelled in 2019, and it is unclear whether it has been held in subsequent years.\nHarare is home to several notable museums and monuments. The National Gallery of Zimbabwe exhibits Shona art and stone sculpture. The Zimbabwe Museum of Human Sciences near Rotten Row documents the archaeology of Southern Africa through the Stone Age and into the Iron Age. Artifacts, newspapers, and other items from milestones in Zimbabwe's history can be found at the National Archives. The Heroes' Acre is a burial ground and national monument, whose purpose is to commemorate both pro-independence fighters killed during the Rhodesian Bush War and contemporary Zimbabweans who have served their country and are buried at the site.\nPrivate cultural institutions include Chapungu Sculpture Park in the Msasa Park neighborhood, which displays the work of Zimbabwean stone sculptors. It was founded in 1970 by Roy Guthrie, who was instrumental in promoting the work of its sculptors worldwide. One notable example of architecture in Harare is the Eastgate Centre, a shopping mall with an innovative design, located equidistant from Unity Square and Borrowdale.\nHarare is home to 4 pipe bands. St Johns College, ( two world championships) Churchill School Pipe band ( Still holds the world endurance piping record of 100 hours) Nantes College Pipe band, and the Harare Caledonian Pipe band.\nGreen spaces.\nHarare has been nicknamed Zimbabwe's \"Sunshine City\" for its abundant parks and outdoor amenities. There is an abundance of parks and gardens across town, many close to the CBD, with a variety of common and rare plant species amid landscaped vistas, pedestrian pathways, and tree-lined avenues. Harare's parks are often considered the best public parks in all of Zimbabwe's major cities. There are also many parks in the surrounding suburbs, particularly in the affluent suburbs of Borrowdale, Mount Pleasant, and Glen Lorne, located northeast of the central business district.\nWithin the city, prominent green spaces include:\nOther sites near the City of Harare include Lake Chivero Dam and Recreational Park, Epworth's balancing rocks, Ewanrigg Botanical Gardens, Domboshava National Monument, Lion and Cheetah Park, and Vaughn Animal Sanctuary.\nPlaces of worship.\nMost places of worship in Harare are Christian churches and temples. Some of the denominations active in Harare, and their associated places of worship, include: Kingdom Prosperity Ministries,Assemblies of God, Baptist Convention of Zimbabwe (Baptist World Alliance), Reformed Church in Zimbabwe (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Church of the Province of Central Africa (Anglican Communion), Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Harare (Catholic Church).\nSister cities.\nHarare has co-operation agreements, partnerships, or sister city agreements with the following towns:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The city proper has a population of 4,265,160 (2025) and is divided into the five political divisions of Kampala Central, Kawempe, Makindye, Nakawa, and Rubaga.\nKampala's metropolitan area consists of the city proper and the neighboring Wakiso District, Mukono District, Mpigi District, Buikwe District and Luweero District. It has a rapidly growing population that is estimated at 6,709,900 people in 2019 by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics in an area of . Other estimates estimate put the size of the metropolitan area at around four million people.\nIn 2015, this metropolitan area generated an estimated nominal GDP of $13.80221\u00a0billion (constant US dollars of 2011), which was more than half of Uganda's GDP for that year, indicating the importance of Kampala to Uganda's economy.\nKampala is reported to be among the fastest-growing cities in Africa, with an annual population growth rate of 4.03 percent, by City Mayors. Mercer (a New York\u2013based consulting firm) has regularly ranked Kampala as East Africa's best city to live in, ahead of Nairobi and Kigali.\nEtymology.\nKampala originally referred to only the present-day Old Kampala hill, on whose summit Fort Lugard was located, and the initial headquarters of the British colonial authorities in the soon to be Uganda Protectorate.\nBefore the British construction of Fort Lugard, the hill was a hunting reserve of the Kabaka (King) of Buganda and had several species of antelope, especially the impala. As a result, when the British colonial officials were allocated this hill by the then Kabaka of Buganda, they referred to it as \"The Hill of the Impala\".\nThe natives, in whose territory this British settlement was located, then translated \"Hill of the Impala\" as Akasozi k\u2019empala. This was then shortened to K'empala and finally, the name \u2018Kampala\u2019 was brought to life. \"Kasozi\" means \"hill\", \"ke\" \"of\", and \"empala\" the plural of \"impala\". Hence the name \"Kampala\" came to refer to this initial British colonial settlement that would later on spread out from the occupied Old Kampala hill near the pre-existing Kibuga (capital) of the Buganda Kingdom.\nHistory.\nThis area of numerous hills and swamps that later become known as Kampala was part of the core of the highly centralised Buganda Kingdom. It was also the site of the shifting \"Kibuga\" (capital) of the different \"Bassekabaka\" (kings) of the Buganda Kingdom, with each \"Kabaka\" (king) upon coronation, or subsequently during their reign, setting up their \"Kibuga\" (capital) on a new or different hill as they wished or desired.\n19th century.\nThe first written description of this \"Kibuga\" (capital) was by the explorer Sir Richard Burton in his book, \"The Lake Region of East Africa\", published in 1860. In the book, Burton, relying on the information collected by Snay Bin Amir, an Arab trader, described the \"Kibuga\" as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2026the settlement is not less than a day's journey in length, the buildings are of cane and rattan. The sultan's (Kabaka) palace is at least a mile long and the circular huts neatly arranged in a line are surrounded by a strong fence which has only four gates.\nIn 1862, when explorer John Speke arrived in Buganda, the \"Kibuga\" (capital) was at Bandabarogo, present-day Banda Hill, and the reigning \"Kabaka\" (King) was Mutesa\u00a0I.\nIn 1875, explorer Henry Morton Stanley reported the capital as being at present-day Lubaga Hill, where he met the same \"Kabaka\", Mutesa I.\nDuring this visit, Stanley wrote a letter that was published in \"The Daily Telegraph\", inviting missionaries to come to Buganda. He also described the \"Kibuga\" in his 1870s dispatches to \"The New York Herald\", thus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As we approached the capital, the highway from Usavara [Busabala] increased in width from to ...Arrived at the capital I found the vast collection of huts crowning the eminence were the Royal Quarters, around which ran several palisades and circular courts, between which and the city was a circular road, ranging from to in width with gardens and huts...\u2014\u200a\nIn 1877, the first missionaries from the Church Mission Society, who were of the Protestant faith, arrived from the United Kingdom and were allocated Namirembe Hill. Two years later, in 1879, the Catholic White Fathers also arrived, first settling at the present-day village of Kitebi near Lubaga; subsequently, they would be allocated Lubaga Hill. The arrival of these two missionary groups laid the ground for the religious wars of 1888 to 1892 between their new converts and forced the missionaries from Great Britain to then lobby for the British government to take over Buganda/Uganda as a protectorate.\nIn 1890, Frederick Lugard, an agent of the Imperial British East Africa Company, arrived in Buganda during the reign of Kabaka Mwanga\u00a0II, with whom he signed a treaty of protection by the British government over Buganda, and the \"Kibuga\" (capital) was located at Mengo Hill. Captain Lugard would, later on, be allocated the Kampala hill that would soon be known as Old Kampala, and on which he built a fort.\nIn 1895, Mengo Senior School, the first school offering Western education in Kampala, was opened by the Church Missionary Society at Namirembe hill, where mostly the children of chiefs and pages of the royal palaces were students.\nIn 1897, Mwanga launched a rebellion but was defeated and was subsequently captured and exiled, in 1899, to the Seychelles alongside Omukama Kabalega, and his 3-year-old son was made \"Kabaka\" by the combined forces of the European officers leading Nubian and Baganda colonial soldiers. This state of affairs later culminated in the signing of the Buganda Agreement (1900) that formalised British colonial rule in Buganda.\nAlso in 1897, Kampala's first Western-style health facility, Mengo Hospital, was opened on Namirembe hill by British doctor and missionary Sir Albert Ruskin Cook. In addition, Sir Albert Ruskin Cook founded Mulago Hospital, the current National Referral Hospital, at Mulago hill in 1913.\nIn 1899, the Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Africa founded Lubaga Hospital on Lubaga Hill.\n20th century.\nIn 1900, the regents of the infant \"Kabaka\" Daudi Cwa II (who were Apolo Kagwa, the \"Katikiro\" (Prime Minister) of Buganda, Stanislaus Mugwanya, the \"Mulamuzi\" (Chief Judge) of Buganda, and Zakaria Kisingiri, the \"Muwanika\" (Chief Treasurer) of Buganda, with Bishop Alfred Tucker), signed the Buganda Agreement on behalf of Buganda with Sir Harry Johnston, who signed on behalf of the British government. \nThis agreement with Sir Harry Johnston created new land tenures such as freehold, Crown land, and mailo, and divided up and allocated the land in such a way that would come to define the development of Kampala.\nThe land in Buganda's \"Kibuga\" (capital), including Mengo Hill and Makerere Hill, was allocated to the young \"Kabaka\", the Baganda colonial collaborators, etc., under mailo and freehold. The religious missions were also formally allocated land they were previously occupying. Thus, the Catholic White Fathers got Lubaga Hill, the Protestant Church Missionary Society got Namirembe Hill, the Muslims under Prince Nuhu Mbogo's leadership received Kibuli Hill, the British Catholic Mill Hill Missionaries received most of Nsambya Hill. The Uganda Protectorate government obtained land classified as Crown lands in the area such as Old Kampala Hill, Nakasero Hill, etc.\nTo legalise the above changes, the following laws and ordinances were subsequently passed: The Crown lands Ordinance of 1903, The Land Law of 1908, The Registration of Land Titles ordinance of 1922, and the Busulu and Envujo law of 1928.\nIn 1906, the Crown lands consisting of Old Kampala, Nakasero hills etc. and covering was consolidated and gazetted as Kampala Township.\nIn 1912, Kampala Township received its first land-use plan and had a European and Asian population of 2,850.\nIn 1922, Kampala's oldest university, Makerere, was founded as the Uganda Technical College at the present Makerere Hill and initially offered carpentry, building construction, mechanics, arts, education, agriculture, and medicine.\nIn 1930, the first sewerage plan was prepared to target a population of 20,000 people in the Nakasero and Old Kampala areas of the Kampala township. This plan guided sewerage development from 1936 to 1940 in planned urban areas of the Kampala Township and excluded the \"Kibuga\" area occupied by the Baganda and other natives.\nIn 1931, the Uganda Railway line reached Kampala, connecting Kampala to Mombasa Port, thirty-five years after the commencement of its construction.\nIn 1938, The East African Power &amp; Lighting Company was granted a licence for thermal electric power generation and distribution for the towns of Kampala and Entebbe, and in the same year Sir Philip Mitchel, the Governor of Uganda, switched on Kampala and Uganda's first electric street lights.\nIn 1945, Ernst May, a German architect, was commissioned by the Uganda Protectorate Government to design a new physical plan for Kampala. Ernst May's plan of 1947 was intended to extend Kampala eastwards covering Kololo Hill and Naguru Hill, and with the commercial centre on the southern slopes of Nakasero Hill, an industrial zone in the southeast of Kampala, and, for the first time, a planned residential zone for the Ugandan natives. The plan was never fully implemented, and in 1951 the third physical plan by Henry Kendall was instead adopted, though it incorporated some elements of Ernst May's 1947 plan.\nHenry Kendall's 1951 plan expanded Kampala from the area of the 1930 plan to an area of incorporating areas like Kololo Hill, and the Industrial Area. However, like the first two planning schemes, the 1951 plan failed to achieve many of its stated objectives.\nOn 9 October 1962, Uganda gained independence; subsequently the capital city was transferred from Entebbe to Kampala and in the same year, Kampala was granted city status.\nIn 1968, six years after Uganda attained independence, the boundaries of Kampala were expanded incorporating the \"Kibuga\" (then known as Mengo Municipality), Kawempe and Nakawa Townships, and areas including Muyenga and Ggaba. This increased the administrative area of Kampala from to the current .\nIn 1972, the fourth physical plan for Kampala was made covering the newly incorporated areas of Kampala's boundary extensions of 1968, but the subsequent political and economic turmoil of the 1970s and 1980s meant the plan was never implemented.\nThe Battle of Kampala during the Ugandan Bush War occurred in January 1986. It resulted in the capture of the city by the National Resistance Movement, led by Yoweri Museveni and the subsequent surrender of the Ugandan government.\nSimilarly, the fifth physical plan for Kampala, made in 1994, like the 1972 plan, was also never implemented.\n21st century.\nIn 2010, the Kampala Capital City Authority Act was enacted, giving the Ugandan Government more control of the administration of Kampala. The act also created the Kampala Metropolitan Physical Planning Authority with the stated aims of improving the infrastructure of the City of Kampala and the surrounding districts of Wakiso, Mukono, Buikwe, Mpigi and Luwero.\nOn 11 July 2010, suicide bombers affiliated with al-Shabaab, a Sunni Islamist group based in Somalia, carried out two nearly simultaneous bombings in Kampala, killing 74 people. After eleven years of relative calm, on 16 November 2021, the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), an Islamist group based in eastern Congo with ties to the Islamic State, carried out two suicide bombings near the central police station and parliament, killing three people and injuring 36.\nGeography.\nTopography.\nThe City of Kampala covers a total area of , comprising of land and of water.\nKampala is a hilly place with its valleys filled with sluggish rivers/ swamps. The highest point in the city proper is the summit of Kololo hill at , located in the center of the city and the lowest point at the shores of Lake Victoria south of the city center at altitude of .\nHills.\nKampala was originally built on seven hills, but it has expanded to cover more than the original seven hills.\nThe original seven hills are:\nSwamps and slow rivers.\nDue to Kampala's hilly nature and tropical climate, the valleys have slow rivers and swamps that tend to flow southwards towards Lake Victoria or northwards. These swamps cover 15% of Kampala's land area. They include:\nVegetation.\nKampala, due to the diversity of habitats that include wetlands and hills, was previously covered with short grasses on the tops of the hills, elephant grass (\"Pennisetum purpureum\" Schumach.), \"Cyperus papyrus\", African water lily etc. in the swamps and evergreen forests with trees such as African olive (mpafu) and Natal fig (mutuba).\nGeology.\nKampala is located on the East African Plateau between the two arms of the East African Rift and on the northern limits of Tanzania Craton.\nClimate.\nKampala has a tropical rainforest climate (\"Af\") under the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system.\nA facet of Kampala's weather is that it features two annual wetter seasons. While the city does not have a true dry season month, it experiences heavier precipitation from August to December and from February to June. However, it is between February and June that Kampala sees substantially heavier rainfall per month, with April typically seeing the heaviest amount of precipitation at an average of around of rain.\nEducation.\nPre-primary education\nPre-primary education is offered only by private entities which are located in the various neighbourhoods of Kampala and is lightly regulated by the Ministry of Education and Sports and starts from age of 6 weeks. Education in Kampala city is provided by a vast number of public and private institutions offering a wide range of educational training that includes pre-primary, primary, secondary, vocational, technical undergraduate and post-graduate education.\nPrimary and secondary education in Kampala\nKampala has a number of both primary and secondary schools in every parish that are mostly privately owned and a handful that are state-owned and are also lightly regulated by the City Education directorate and Ministry of Education and Sports.\nSome of the private institutions:\nVocational and technical education in Kampala\nKampala has a number of both private and state institutions offering training in a broad range of fields as indicated in the table below:\nThe city is also home to various public and private universities in the country including Makerere University, Kyambogo University, Kampala University, African Bible University, International University of East Africa, Ndejje University and many others. \nDemographics.\nThe population of Kampala city proper has been rapidly increasing from 62,264 in 1948 to 1,189,142 in 2002, then 1,507,080 in 2014. In 2019, the population was estimated to be 1,650,800.\nAccording to the 2024 Uganda Population and Housing Census, Kampala had a population of 1,797,722 residents, consisting of 1,004,884 males and 792,838 females. The average household size in the city was 2.9 persons.\nKampala, being the capital city and economic engine of Uganda, has a diverse ethnic population drawn from all parts of the country and also from neighboring countries such as Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Eritrea, Somalia, and even from countries as far away as India and China.\nCross-cultural intimate relations in Kampala and even Uganda as a whole is still unusual. Although many of Kampala's residents live and work in close contact, they still define themselves by their ethnic origins. This is more evident in the native languages (alongside Luganda and English) that are used at home, workplaces, and public spaces. In addition to the Baganda and Banyankole, other large ethnic groups include the Basoga, Bafumbira, Batoro, Bakiga, Alur, Bagisu (better known as Bamasaba), Banyoro, Iteso, Langi, and Acholi.\nHistorical population data for Kampala\nCulture.\nCultural institutions.\nProminent cultural institutions include the Uganda Museum and the Ugandan National Theatre.\nThe city also serves as the seat of the Buganda kingdom in Mengo.\nOne of the most notable sites is the Kasubi Tombs, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the burial grounds of the Buganda kings.\nThe Independence Monument, located in the heart of Kampala, is a symbol of Uganda's freedom from colonial rule.\nShopping and entertainment.\nKampala is also known for its vibrant shopping scene, offering everything from traditional crafts to modern fashion.

There is also Nakasero Market, one of Africa's largest and liveliest.\nKampala's nightlife is another aspect of the city's leisure that cannot be overlooked. The city is alive with music and dance, with numerous bars, clubs, and lounges offering entertainment late into the night. Kabalagala and Kololo are popular areas for nightlife.\nCuisine.\nFor those who prefer dining in a more formal setting, Kampala has numerous restaurants that offer a variety of cuisines. \nCafe javas is a popular chain that offers a blend of local and international dishes for both a casual meal and a business meeting. \nOne dish is called TV Chicken, named because the chicken is roasted in a rotisserie oven with a glass window that customers can watch the chicken through.\nNsenene vendors (nsenene are grasshoppers) set up shop in May and November, during grasshopper season.\nGaba Fish Market, located on Lake Victoria, is the biggest fish market in the city.\nNdere Cultural Centre.\nA prominent cultural centre in the Kampala area of Kisasi that aims to promote Ugandan and African cultural expressions through music, dance, and drama. The name Ndere is derived from the noun 'endere', which means flute. As an instrument found in all cultures, it is chosen as a peaceful symbol of the universality of cultural expressions. The Ndere centre is famous for its Ndere troupe, a music and dance troupe that perform several nights every week at the centre showcasing music and dance from all over Uganda as well as Rwanda and Burundi.\nSport.\nKampala is home to the City Oilers, one of East Africa's top basketball club teams. It is the only East African team that competes in the FIBA Africa Clubs Champions Cup. The Oilers play their home games in the MTN Arena, which is based in Kampala's Lugogo Area.\nThe city hosted the IAAF World Cross Country Championships in 2017.\nThe city also hosted the Rugby Africa Cup in 2024 at the Mandela National Stadium. \nThe 2027 Africa Cup of Nations will be hosted in the city alongside neighbouring countries of Tanzania and Kenya.\nThe Mandela National Stadium, commonly known as Namboole Stadium, is the largest and most iconic sports facility in Uganda. Located just outside Kampala in Bweyogerere, this multi-purpose stadium has a seating capacity of over 45,000 and is the primary venue for major sporting events, including football matches, athletics, and concerts. The stadium is home to the Uganda national football team, the Cranes, and hosts various local and international competitions.\nLugogo Sports Complex is a sports hub in Kampala, offering facilities for a range of sports including tennis, cricket, and boxing. The MTN Arena within the complex is a modern indoor arena with a capacity of around 3,000, used for basketball, netball, volleyball, and other indoor sports. The Lugogo Cricket Oval is another highlight, hosting national and international cricket matches, making it the center of cricket in Uganda.\nThe Kampala Golf Club, located in the heart of the city, is Uganda's oldest golf course and a premier destination for golfers.

Some of the businesses that maintain their headquarters in the city center include all of the 25 commercial banks licensed in Uganda; the New Vision Group, the leading news media conglomerate and majority owned by the government; and the \"Daily Monitor\" publication, a member of the Kenya-based Nation Media Group. Air Uganda maintained its headquarters in an office complex on Kololo Hill in Kampala. Crown Beverages Limited, the sole Pepsi-Cola franchise bottler in the country, is situated in Nakawa, a division of Kampala, about east of the city centre.\nThe informal sector is a large contributor to Kampala's GDP. Citizens who work in the formal sector also participate in informal activities to earn more income for their families. A public servant in Kampala, for example, may engage in agriculture in addition to working in the formal sector. Other informal fields include owning taxis and urban agriculture. The use of Kampala's wetlands for urban farming has increased over the past few decades. It connects the informal rural settlements with the more industrialized parts of the city. The produce grown in the wetlands is sold in markets in the urban areas.\nIn December 2015, Google launched its first Wi-Fi network in Kampala.\nWhile more than 30 percent of Kampala's inhabitants practice urban agriculture, the city of Kampala donated to promote urban agriculture in the northeastern parish of Kyanja, in Nakawa Division.\nTransport.\nKampala is served by Entebbe International Airport, which is the largest airport in Uganda.\nBoda-bodas (local motorbike transport) are a popular mode of transport that gives access to many areas within and outside the city. Standard fees for these range from USh:1,000 to 2,000 or more. Boda-bodas are useful for passing through rush-hour traffic, although many are poorly maintained and dangerous.\nIn early 2007, it was announced that Kampala would remove commuter taxis from its streets and replace them with a comprehensive city bus service. (In Kampala, the term \"taxi\" refers to a 15-seater minibus used as public transport.) The bus service was expected to cover the greater Kampala metropolitan area including Mukono, Mpigi, Bombo, Entebbe, Wakiso and Gayaza. As of December 2011[ [update]] the service had not yet started. Having successfully completed the Northern Bypass, the government, in collaboration with its stakeholders, now plans to introduce the bus rapid transit (BRT) system in Kampala by 2014. On 12 March 2012, Pioneer Easy Bus Company, a private transport company, started public bus service in Kampala with an estimated 100 buses each with a 60-passenger capacity (30 seated and 30 standing), acquired from China. Another 422 buses were expected in the country in 2012. The buses operate 24 hours daily. The company has a concession to provide public transport in the city for the next five years. The buses were impounded for back taxes in December 2013. The company expected to resume operation in February 2015.\nIn 2014, Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation signed a Memorandum of Understanding, to embark on building a light rail system, the Greater Kampala Light Rail, similar to the one in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\nOn 11 April 2011, the pressure group Activists for Change (A4C) held its first Walk to Work protest near Kampala, in response to a comment by President Museveni on the increased cost of fuel, which had risen by 50 percent between January and April 2011. He said: \"What I call on the public to do is to use fuel sparingly. Don't drive to bars.\" The protest, which called on workers to walk to work to highlight the increased cost of transport in Uganda, was disrupted by police, who fired tear gas and arrested three-time presidential candidate Kizza Besigye and Democratic Party leader Norbert Mao. In the course of the protest, Besigye was shot in the right arm by a rubber bullet. The government blamed the violence on protesters.\nIn 2016, the Rift Valley Railways Consortium (RVR) and Kampala Capital City Authority established passenger rail service between Namanve and Kampala and between Kampala and Kyengera. Those services were temporarily discontinued after RVR lost its concession in Uganda in October 2017. However, when Uganda Railways Corporation took over the operations of the metre gauge railway system in Uganda in 2018, the service was restored in February that year. A new Kampala to Port Bell route is being planned to be added in the 2018/2019 financial year.\nPlaces of worship.\nAmong the places of worship are predominantly Christian churches and temples: Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kampala (Catholic Church), Church of Uganda (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Church in Uganda (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Baptist Union of Uganda (Baptist World Alliance), and Assemblies of God. There are also Muslim mosques.\nKampala hosts a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed House of Worship known as the Mother Temple of Africa which is situated on Kikaya Hill in the outskirts of the city. The temple was inaugurated in January 1961.\nHealth care.\nKampala is the country's main hub for health care services. It offers a mix of public hospitals, private clinics, and specialized medical centers that serve both locals and international visitors. The quality of care varies depending on the type of facility, but in general, Kampala provides the best medical options in the country.\nPublic health care in Kampala is overseen by the Ministry of Health. The city hosts key government hospitals such as Mulago National Referral Hospital, Uganda's largest and most advanced public hospital. Mulago serves as a teaching hospital for Makerere University's College of Health Sciences and provides a wide range of services, including surgery, maternal health, pediatrics, and specialized care. While public hospitals are often affordable or free, they face challenges like overcrowding, long waiting times, limited medical supplies, and under-staffing.\nKampala also has a growing number of private hospitals and clinics offering higher standards of care, often preferred by the middle class, expats, and medical tourists. Some notable private institutions include: Nakasero Hospital \u2013 a modern private hospital known for advanced diagnostics and surgery. International Hospital Kampala (IHK) \u2013 a leading facility offering general and specialized care. Kampala Hospital \u2013 known for quality services and patient-focused care. Case Hospital \u2013 provides both inpatient and outpatient services among many others. Private facilities tend to be better equipped and offer faster service but come at a higher cost. Many accept international health insurance, though it's important to confirm in advance.\nNotable people.\nOther.\nPeople awarded the honorary citizenship of Kampala are:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located near the country's geographic centre, in a landscape of rolling hills marked by valleys and ridges connected by steep slopes. A Rwanda's primate city, Kigali is a relatively young urban centre. Founded in 1907 as a German administrative outpost, it served as a minor administrative centre until it became the national capital at independence in 1962, shifting the main administrative focus away from Huye (formerly Astrida).\nAs of 31 August 2022, Kigali city has a population of 1,745,555 inhabitants, roughly seven times that of the nation's second most populous city, Gisenyi. Kigali's UNHCR coordinate operations for nearly 135,000 refugees and has a special facility in Gashora, to temporarily host refugees who are being resettled from crisis zones, mainly Libya, Yemen or other conflict areas, and provided with medical care, basic services and legal processing. After preparation, they are resettled to countries like the United States or Canada. Also notable, before cancellation in July 2024, the Rwanda asylum plan or \"Rwanda Plan\" was an agreement to accept deported migrants from the United Kingdom.\nIn an area controlled by the Kingdom of Rwanda from the 15th century, and then by the German Empire in the beginning of the 20th century, the city was founded in 1907 when Richard Kandt, the colonial resident, chose the site for his headquarters, citing its central location, views and security. Foreign merchants began to trade in the city during the German era, and Kandt opened some government-run schools for Tutsi Rwandan students. Belgium took control of Rwanda and Burundi during World War I, forming the mandate of Ruanda-Urundi. Kigali remained the seat of colonial administration for Rwanda but Ruanda-Urundi's capital was at Usumbura (now Bujumbura) in Burundi and Kigali remained a small city with a population of just 6,000 at the time of independence.\nKigali grew slowly during the following decades. It was not initially directly affected by the Rwandan Civil War between government forces and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which began in 1990. However, in April 1994 Rwanda's President Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana was killed when his aircraft was shot down near Kigali. His death was followed by the Rwandan genocide, which killed over 500,000 Tutsi. The RPF resumed fighting, ending a cease-fire of more than a year. They gradually took control of most of the country and seized Kigali on 4 July 1994. Post-genocide Kigali has experienced rapid population growth, with much of the city rebuilt.\nThe city of Kigali is one of the five provinces of Rwanda, with boundaries set in 2006. It is divided into three districts\u2014Gasabo, Kicukiro, and Nyarugenge\u2014which historically had control of significant areas of local governance. Reforms in January 2020 transferred much of the districts' power to the city-wide council. The city also hosts the main residence and offices of the president of Rwanda and most government ministries. The largest contributor to Kigali's gross domestic product is the service sector, but a significant proportion of the population works in agriculture including small-scale subsistence farming. Attracting international visitors is a priority for city authorities, including leisure tourism, conferences and exhibitions.\nEtymology.\nThe name Kigali comes from the Kinyarwanda prefix combined with the adjective suffix , which means wide or broad. This was originally applied to Mount Kigali, most likely because the mountain itself was broad and wide, with the city later being named after the mountain. According to Rwandan oral history, the name originated in the 14th century. Rwandan scholar Alexis Kagame, who did extensive research into the country's oral history and traditions, wrote that the name Kigali came into use after King Cyilima I Rugwe completed a conquest of the area. The legend states that Rugwe viewed the territory from the top of a hill and said \"burya iki gihugu ni kigali\", which translates to \"this country is vast\".\nHistory.\nPre-colonial period.\nThe earliest inhabitants of what is now Rwanda were the Twa, a group of aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who settled the area between 8000 and 3000\u00a0BC and remain in the country today. They were followed between 700\u00a0BC and AD\u00a01500 by a number of Bantu groups, including the Hutu and Tutsi, who began clearing forests for agriculture. According to oral history, the Kingdom of Rwanda was founded in the 14th century on the shores of Lake Muhazi, around east of modern Kigali. The early kingdom included Kigali but it was a small state at this point in its history with larger and more powerful neighbours, Bugesera and Gisaka.\nA member of the Gisaka dynasty killed Rwanda's king Ruganzu I Bwimba in the 16th century, but Ruganzu's son Cyilima I Rugwe fought back with help from Bugesera and was able to expand Rwanda's territory. In the late 16th or early 17th century, the kingdom of Rwanda was invaded from the north by the Banyoro of modern-day Uganda. The king was forced to flee westward, leaving Kigali and eastern Rwanda in the hands of Bugesera and Gisaka. The formation of a new Rwandan dynasty in the 17th century by the \"mwami\" (king), Ruganzu II Ndoli, followed by eastward invasions and the conquest of Bugesera, marked the beginning of the Rwandan kingdom's dominance in the area. The capital of the kingdom was at Nyanza, in the south of the country.\nColonial period.\nThe founding of Kigali is generally dated to 1907, when German administrator and explorer Richard Kandt was appointed as the first resident of Rwanda, and established the city as the headquarters. Alexis Kagame promoted an alternative theory that the city was established as a capital under Cyilima I Rugwe in either the 1300s or the 1500s. There is little direct evidence for this, however, and the more recent kings of the pre-colonial era are known to have been based at Nyanza. Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi had been assigned to Germany by the Berlin Conference of 1884, forming part of German East Africa, and Germany established a presence in the country in 1897 with the formation of an alliance with the king, Yuhi V Musinga. Kandt arrived in 1899, to explore Lake Kivu and search for the source of the Nile.\nWhen Germany decided in 1907 to separate the administration of Rwanda from that of Burundi, Kandt was appointed as resident. He chose to make his headquarters in Kigali due to its central location in the country, and also because the site on Nyarugenge Hill afforded good views and security. Kandt's house, located close to the central business district (CBD), was the first European-style house in the city, and remains in use today as the Kandt House Museum of Natural History. Despite a German ordinance written in 1905, which prohibited \"non-indigenous natives\" from entering Rwanda, Kandt began permitting the entry of foreign traders in 1908, which allowed commercial activity to begin in Rwanda. Kigali's first businesses were established by Greek and Indian merchants, with assistance from Baganda and Swahili people. Items traded included cloth and beads. Commercial activity was limited and there were only around 30 firms in the city by 1914. Kandt also opened government-run schools in Kigali, which began educating Tutsi students.\nBelgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi during World War I, with Kigali being captured by the Northern Brigade led by Colonel Philippe Molitor on 6 May 1916. The Belgians were granted sovereignty by a League of Nations mandate in 1922, forming the mandatory territory of Ruanda-Urundi. In early 1917, Belgium attempted to assert direct rule on the mandate, placing King Musinga under arrest and sidelining Rwandans in the judiciary. In this period, Kigali was one of two provincial capitals, alongside Gisenyi. An agricultural-labour shortage caused by the recruitment of locals to assist the European armies during the war, the plundering of food by soldiers, and torrential rains which destroyed crops, led to a severe famine at the start of the Belgian administration. The famine, combined with the difficulty of governing the complex Rwandan society, prompted the Belgians to re-establish the German-style indirect rule at the end of 1917. Musinga was restored to his throne at Nyanza, with Kigali remaining home to the colonial administration. This arrangement persisted until the mid-1920s, but from 1924 the Belgians began once more to sideline the monarchy, this time permanently. Belgium took over control of dispute resolution, appointment of officials and collection of taxes. Kigali remained relatively small through the remainder of the colonial era, as much of the administration took place in Ruanda-Urundi's capital Usumbura, now known as Bujumbura in Burundi. Usumbura's population exceeded 50,000 during the 1950s and was the mandate's only European-style city, while Kigali's population remained at around 6,000 until independence in 1962.\nPost-independence era.\nKigali became the capital upon Rwandan independence in 1962. Two other cities were considered: Nyanza, as the traditional seat of the \"mwami\", and the southern city of Butare (known as Astrida under the Belgians), due to its prominence as a centre of intellect and religion. The authorities eventually chose Kigali because of its more central location. The city grew steadily during the following decades; in the early 1970s the population was 25,000 with only five paved roads, and by 1991 it was around 250,000. On 5 July 1973 there was a bloodless military coup, in which minister of defence Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana overthrew ruling president Gr\u00e9goire Kayibanda. Military officers had gathered in Kigali for a military tattoo to commemorate Independence Day a few days earlier, and they began occupying government buildings from dawn on 4 July. Businesses closed for a few days, and troops patrolled across the city, but the coup was bloodless and life continued as normal, historian G\u00e9rard Prunier describing the reaction as \"widespread popular relief\". According to a US Department of State diplomatic cable sent shortly afterwards, the disruption following the coup was short-lived and the army had left the streets by 11 July.\nKigali was not directly affected during the first three years of the 1990\u20131994 Rwandan Civil War, although the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) did come close to attacking the city in February 1993. In December of the same year, following the signing of the Arusha Accords, a United Nations peacekeeping force was established in the city, and the RPF were granted use of a building in the city for their diplomats and soldiers. In April 1994 President Habyarimana was assassinated when his plane was shot down near Kigali International Airport. Burundian president Cyprien Ntaryamira was also killed in the attack. This was the catalyst for the Rwandan genocide, in which 500,000\u2013800,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks on the orders of the interim government. Opposition politicians based in Kigali were killed on the first day of the genocide, and the city then became the setting for fierce fighting between the army and the RPF including at the latter's base. The RPF began attacking from the north of the country, and gradually took control of most of Rwanda between April and June. After encircling Kigali and cutting off its supply routes, they began fighting for the city itself in mid-June. The government forces had superior manpower and weapons but the RPF fought tactically, and were able to exploit the fact that the government forces were concentrating on the genocide rather than the fight for Kigali. The RPF took control of Kigali on 4 July, a date now commemorated as Liberation Day, a Rwandan national holiday.\nSince the war and genocide, the city has experienced rapid population growth as a result of migration from other areas, as well as a high birth rate. Buildings that were heavily damaged during the fighting have been demolished, much of the city has been rebuilt, and modern office buildings and infrastructure now exist across the city. A masterplan, adopted by the city and the government in 2013 and supported by international finance and labour, seeks to establish Kigali as a decentralised modern city by 2040. The development has been accompanied by forced eviction of residents in informal housing zones, however, and groups such as Human Rights Watch have accused the government of removing poor people and children from the city's streets and moving them to detention centres.\nGeography.\nKigali is located in the centre of Rwanda, at 1\u00b057\u2032S 30\u00b04\u2032E. Like the rest of Rwanda it uses Central Africa Time, and is two hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC+02:00) throughout the year. The city is coterminous with the province of Kigali, one of the five provinces of Rwanda introduced in 2006 as part of a restructuring of local government in the country. The city has boundaries with the Northern, Eastern and Southern provinces. It is divided into three administrative districts\u2014Nyarugenge in the south west, Kicukiro in the south east, and Gasabo, which occupies the northern half of the city's territory. The built-up urban area covers about 70 per cent of the municipal boundaries. Kigali lies in a region of rolling hills, with a series of valleys and ridges joined by steep slopes. It is situated between Mount Kigali and Mount Jali, both of which have elevations of more than above sea level, while the lowest areas of the city have an altitude of . Geologically, Kigali is in a granitic and metasedimentary region, with lateritic soils on the hills and alluvial soils in the valleys.\nThe Nyabarongo River, part of the upper headwaters of the Nile, forms the western and southern borders of the administrative city of Kigali, although this river lies somewhat outside the built-up urban area. The largest river running through the city is the Nyabugogo River, which flows south from Lake Muhazi before flowing west between Mount Kigali and Mount Jali, and draining into the Nyabarongo. The Nyabugogo is fed by various smaller streams throughout the city, and its drainage basin contains most of Kigali's territory, other than areas in the south which outflow directly to the Nyabarongo. The rivers are flanked by wetlands, which act as a water store and flood protection for the city, although these are under threat from agriculture and development. The \"Umusambi Village\" is a restored marshland in Kigali that serves as a shelter for vulnerable grey crowned cranes.\nCityscape.\nKigali's central business district (CBD), sometimes known by the Kinyarwanda term \"mu mujyi\" (\"in town\"), is on Nyarugenge Hill and was the site of the original city founded by Richard Kandt in 1907. The house that Kandt lived in is now the Kandt House Museum of Natural History. The CBD is situated towards the western edge of the built-up area, as the terrain to the east was more suitable for development of the expanding city than the high slopes of Mount Kigali to the west. Several of Rwanda's tallest buildings, including the 20-storey Kigali City Tower, are located in the CBD, as are the headquarters of the country's largest banks and businesses. Other buildings in the CBD include the upmarket Serena, Marriott and Mille Collines hotels, the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali, the national university's College of Science and Technology, and government buildings such as the National Bank of Rwanda and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning.\nTo the south west of the CBD, and also on the Nyarugenge Hill, is the suburb of Nyamirambo. This was the second part of the city to be settled, being built in the 1920s by the Belgian colonial government as a home for civil servants and Swahili traders. The latter group were mostly members of the Islamic faith, which led to Nyamirambo being known as the \"Muslim Quarter\". Nyamirambo's Green Mosque (\"Masjid al-Fatah\") is the oldest mosque in Kigali, dating to the 1930s. Travel publisher Rough Guides described Nyamirambo in 2015 as \"Kigali's coolest neighbourhood\", citing its multi-cultural status and an active nightlife, which is not found in much of the rest of the city. North of Nyamirambo, and west of the CBD is Nyabugogo. Situated at the lowest part of the city, in the valley of the eponymous Nyabugogo River, Nyabugogo is home to Kigali's principal bus and share taxi station, with vehicles departing for numerous domestic and international destinations.\nThe remainder of Kigali's suburbs lie to the east of the CBD, with an urban sprawl spanning the many hills and ridges. Kiyovu is the closest, on the eastern slopes of Nyarugenge Hill. The higher part of Kiyovu, to the south of main road KN3, has been home to wealthy foreign residents and Rwandans since colonial times, with large houses and high-end restaurants. The residence of the Rwandan president is located in this area. The lower part of Kiyovu, north of the main road, consisted until 2008 of informal settlements that had formed after independence, when strict residence rules were relaxed. The houses in lower Kiyovu were expropriated by the government in 2008 with residents compensated or relocated to other areas, including to a purpose-built estate in the Batsinda neighbourhood.\nThe government has plans to create a new business district in lower Kiyovu to complement the existing CBD, although as of late 2017 there had been only a handful of buildings erected there. Other eastern suburbs include Kacyiru, home to most government departments and the office of the president; Gisozi, where the Kigali Genocide Memorial is located; Nyarutarama, an affluent suburb housing the city's only golf course; Kimihurura; Remera and Kanombe, from the CBD on the eastern edge of the city, where Kigali International Airport is located. Kigali has been ranked the \"cleanest city in Africa\" in recent years.\nClimate.\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Kigali is in the tropical savanna climate (\"Aw\") zone, with temperatures that are cooler than typical for equatorial countries because of its high elevation.\nThe city has an average daily temperature range between , with little variation through the year. There are two rainy seasons annually, from February to June and from September to December. These are separated by two dry seasons: the major one from June to September, during which there is often no rain at all, and a shorter and less severe one from December to February. The wettest month is April, with an average rainfall of , while the driest month is July. Global warming has caused a change in the pattern of the rainy seasons. According to a report by the Strategic Foresight Group, change in climate has reduced the number of rainy days experienced during a year, but has also caused an increase in frequency of torrential rains. Strategic Foresight also characterise Rwanda as a rapidly warming country, with an increase in average temperature of between 0.7\u00a0\u00b0C to 0.9\u00a0\u00b0C over the 50 years to 2013.\nDemographics.\nAs of the 2022 Rwandan census, the population of Kigali was 1,745,555. The population density was . At the time of independence in 1962, Kigali had 6,000 inhabitants, consisting primarily of those associated with the Belgian colonial residency. It grew considerably after being named as the independent nation's capital, although it remained a relatively small city until the 1970s due to government policies restricting rural-to-urban migration. The population reached 115,000 by 1978, and 235,000 by 1991. The city lost a large fraction of its people during the 1994 genocide, including those killed and those who fled to neighbouring countries. From 1995 the economy began to recover and large numbers of long-term Tutsi refugees returned from Uganda. Many of these refugees settled in Kigali and other urban areas, due to difficulty in obtaining land in other parts of the country. This phenomenon, coupled with a high birth rate and increased rural-to-urban migration, meant that Kigali reattained its previous size quite quickly and began to grow even more rapidly than before. The population exceeded 600,000 in 2002, and in the 2012 census had almost doubled to 1.13\u00a0million, although this was in part because the administrative boundaries of the city had been expanded.\nAs of the 2012 census, 51.7 per cent of residents were male. The Rwanda Environment Management Authority hypothesised that the high male-to-female ratio was due to a tendency for men to migrate to the city in search of work outside the agricultural sector, while their wives remained in a rural home. The population is young, with 73 per cent of residents being less than 30 years old, and 94 per cent under the age of 50. The city has a higher proportion of 14\u201335 year olds than the Rwanda average, with 50.3 per cent versus 39.6 per cent nationwide. Children between birth and seventeen (i.e. &lt; 18) years of age have a below-average share of the total, with 39.6 per cent against 47.7 per cent nationally. These differences are attributed by the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) to the migration of working-age Rwandans from rural to urban areas. Similarly, Kigali has a lower level of over-60s, with 2.6 per cent, than the Rwanda average of 4.9 per cent, also likely reflecting the tendency for non-working-age inhabitants to live rurally. In 2014, the proportion of people classified as living in poverty within Kigali was 15 per cent, compared with 37 per cent for Rwanda as a whole. The 2012 census recorded a workforce of 487,000 in Kigali. The city's biggest employment sector is agriculture, fishing and forestry, covering 24 per cent of the workforce; utilities and financial services with 21 per cent; trade 20 per cent and government 12 per cent.\nIn 2018 Kigali scored 0.632 on the Human Development Index (HDI), a composite measure of life expectancy and health, education, and standard of living. This figure had risen or remained the same every year since 1992, except during the civil war, when the figure was 0.223. It is also the highest of Rwanda's five provinces with the next highest, the Northern Province, recording an HDI of 0.531. Analysts at the World Bank attribute the gains in HDI seen across Rwanda as a whole to a \"strong focus on homegrown policies and initiatives\", which have accompanied economic growth.\nAs with Rwanda as a whole, Christianity is the dominant religion in Kigali. In the 2012 census, 42.1 per cent of the city's inhabitants identified as Protestant with a further 9.1 per cent following Adventism, which was classified separately. Catholics formed 36.8 per cent of the population. Islam is more prevalent in Kigali than elsewhere in Rwanda, with 5.7 per cent of people following the faith compared with 2.0 per cent nationwide. Jehovah's Witnesses form 1.2 per cent and other faiths 0.3 per cent, while those who profess no religion number 3.0 per cent.\nEconomy.\nKigali is the economic and financial hub of Rwanda, serving as the country's main port of entry and largest business centre. The NISR does not maintain detailed economic data for subnational entities in Rwanda, but economists have used various measures to estimate the city's output. A 2015 working paper by the World Bank Policy Research unit used the amount of light visible at night in different regions as a proxy for relative gross domestic product (GDP), and found that the three districts of Kigali represented 42 per cent of Rwanda's total night-light output. When translated, this gives a total city GDP of approximately US$1.8\u00a0billion or $1,619 per capita, compared with a national average of $436 per capita. Another 2015 World Bank study measured the total turnover of registered companies in the country, as reported to the Rwanda Revenue Authority, and found that 92 per cent of these were from the city of Kigali. However, the authors noted that this figure excluded turnover from small-scale farming, and was also inflated for companies headquartered in Kigali with revenue generated elsewhere in Rwanda. Official statistics classify economic activity as either \"farm\" or \"non-farm\", and Kigali accounts for 39 per cent of non-farm waged employees in the country.\nIn 2013, the economy was reported to be dependent on foreign aid and illegal resource extraction from the DRC. The largest contributor to Kigali's economy is the service sector. The World Bank estimates that services contributed 53 per cent of GDP in 2014, while a 2012 study by Surbana International Consultants put the figure at almost 62 per cent. Activity within the service sector includes retail, information technology, transport and hotels, and real estate. The city authorities have prioritised business services for expansion, constructing several modern buildings in the CBD such as the Kigali City Tower. Attracting international visitors is a priority for both the city and the Rwanda Development Board, including leisure tourism, conferences and exhibitions. Kigali is the major arrival point for tourists visiting Rwanda's national parks and tracking mountain gorillas, and has its own sites of interest such as the Kigali Genocide Memorial and ecotourist facilities, as well as bars, coffee shops and restaurants. Expansion of destinations by carrier RwandAir and building of new facilities such as the Kigali Convention Centre has attracted events to Kigali including the African Development Bank's 2014 Annual General Assembly, and a 2018 extraordinary summit of the African Union. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting was held in the city in June 2022, with attendees including Charles, Prince of Wales, and national leaders, having been postponed from June 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe city's largest employment sector is agriculture, fishing and forestry, representing 24 per cent of the workforce. Farmland comprised over 60 per cent of the land within the city's boundaries in 2012, mostly in the outer areas surrounding the urban core. As is the case nationwide, much of the agriculture in Kigali is subsistence farming on small plots, but there are some larger modern farms close to the city, particularly in Gasabo district, which has the highest average area of cultivated land per household in the country. Other major employment areas in the city are government, which comprises 12 per cent of the workforce, transportation and communication, construction, and manufacturing. The NISR classifies 21 per cent of the workforce as being employed in \"other services\" such as utilities and financial services, the latter including banking, pensions, insurance, microfinance, and the Rwanda Stock Exchange, which launched in 2011.\nIndustry in Kigali formed only 14 per cent of the city's GDP in 2014, focused on a small industrial zone set up in the 1970s. Challenges for the sector include the high cost of importing raw materials into a land-locked country, as well as substandard infrastructure and a lack of skilled workers. In 2011, the parliament passed a law establishing special economic zones in Rwanda, the first of which was established in 2014 on Masoro Hill in Gasabo district, close to Kigali International Airport. Companies operating within the zone benefit from good infrastructure, availability of land and transport links, as well as tax breaks. It attracted 61 businesses in its first year of operation, manufacturing products such as paper and foam mattresses. As the zone grew over subsequent years, further businesses relocated there from other parts of the capital such as the Gikondo Industrial Park. The city sits close to deposits of cassiterite, an ore used to obtain tin, as well as tungsten. Cassiterite is mined in the town of Rutongo, around north of Kigali, while tungsten is mined at Nyakabingo, a similar distance away. Much of the raw mineral is exported out of Rwanda for processing, but there are some local processing facilities. This includes the Karuruma smelter in the northern suburbs of Kigali, which was built in the 1980s and was able to produce up to of pure tin per year as of 2019.\nGovernance and politics.\nKigali is a province-level city, one of the five provinces of Rwanda. The area under the city's jurisdiction has been expanded several times since Rwandan independence, the current boundaries being established through a 2005 law as part of local-government restructuring. The law gave the city government responsibility for strategic planning and urban development, as well as liaising with the three constituent districts and monitoring the districts' development plans. Like other provinces, Kigali is divided into districts\u2014Gasabo, Kicukiro, and Nyarugenge\u2014which are in turn divided into 35 sectors.\nFrom January 2020, a new administrative system for Kigali was introduced, after a law was passed by the national parliament the previous year. Under the previous system, in effect since 2002, power was significantly devolved to the districts which were led by their own mayors, managing infrastructure and levying taxes, around 30 per cent of which were passed to the city-wide authority. The changes, implemented with the goal of reducing bureaucracy and inefficiency, gave the city council much greater power including control of the budget. The districts ceased to be separate legal entities, their mayors being replaced by district executive administrators appointed by the national government.\nThe city council is composed of eleven individuals, down from 33 in the old system. Six of the council members are directly elected by the public, each district electing one man and one woman. The remaining five members are appointed by the president of Rwanda, subject to the approval of the cabinet. Each council member serves for a renewable five-year term. The executive branch of the city government is headed by the mayor, who is elected via a complex electoral college system, with the electorate voting for delegates at the sub-sector village level, who go on to elect other delegates through each level of the administrative hierarchy. The mayor and two deputy mayors form the executive committee, which reports to the council and implements its decisions. As of 2023 the incumbent mayor is Samuel Dusengiyumva. Notable past mayors include Francois Karera, who held the post from 1975 to 1990 under the presidency of Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana, and Rose Kabuye, who had fought with the RPF during the Rwandan Civil War and was the first post-genocide mayor from 1994 to 1997. Day-to-day budget and staff management are the responsibility of a city manager, appointed by the prime minister.\nIn addition to the city government, most Rwandan government offices are located in Kigali, particularly in the suburbs of Kacyiru and Kimihurura. This includes Village Urugwiro in Kacyiru, which is the office of the president, and the Chamber of Deputies and Senate in Kimihurura.\nCrime and policing.\nIn common with the rest of the country, policing in Kigali is provided by the Rwanda National Police (RNP). The city falls within RNP's central division, which is headed as of 2020 by Assistant Commissioner of Police Felly Rutagerura Bahizi. The United States government's Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) praises the RNP's professionalism, but notes that it lacks specialist skills in dealing with policing tasks such as investigation, counter-terrorism, bomb disposal, and forensics. OSAC also notes that the RNP has limited resources on the ground, stating that police are often \"unable to respond to an emergency call in a timely manner\", and that police patrols are more focused on terrorism than crime.\nDespite this, Kigali has a reputation for being a relatively safe city. The \"Lonely Planet\" guidebook describes it as \"a genuine contender for the safest capital in Africa\", while Bert Archer of BBC Travel described it as \"clean and safe\". In a 2015 interview with \"The New Times\", then-commander of the central division Rogers Rutikanga cited \"efficient operations and daily surveillance\" as the means by which the city was policed. Rutikanga noted that there were crimes related to burglary, drugs, assault and robbery, as well as petty crime and pickpocketing, but that numbers were kept low through community policing and engagement with schools, businesses, municipal government and social service providers. In its advice to overseas visitors, OSAC states that there is a \"moderate risk from crime in Kigali\", but notes that such crime is rarely violent. It cites pickpocketing and petty theft as the biggest concerns for foreigners within the city. Rwanda as a whole has lower crime rates than other countries in East Africa. In 2014\u201315, the number of intentional homicides per 100,000 people was 2.52 in the country, compared with 11.52 for Uganda, 6.95 for Tanzania, 4.79 for Kenya, and 4.52 for Burundi.\nAlthough the constitution allows freedom of assembly, with protests and demonstrations allowed with a permit, such gatherings in Rwanda are rare. The US political freedom research institute Freedom House states that fear of arrest serves as a deterrent for most such protests, and that the police often disperse protests even when they have official permission. Those gatherings which do take place are mostly peaceful and crime-free. OSAC's report assesses the city's terrorism risk as \"minimal\".\nCulture.\nMusic and dance.\nKigali was not historically the hub of Rwanda's cultural heritage. For example, the country's traditional dance, a choreographed routine consisting of three components, originated in the royal court at Nyanza. However, the capital is now home to many groups which perform the dance including the LEAF community arts troupe, whose founding members were eighteen homeless orphaned children, and \"Indatirwabahizi\", a cultural troupe affiliated with the city government. Drums are of great importance in traditional Rwandan music; the royal drummers enjoyed high status within the court of the \"mwami\". Drummers play together in groups of varying sizes, usually between seven and nine in number. Traditional music and songs are performed in venues across the city by acts such as the Gakondo Group led by Massamba Intore.\nRwanda and Kigali have a growing popular music industry, influenced by African Great Lakes, Congolese, and American music. The most popular genre is hip hop, with a blend of dancehall, rap, ragga, R&amp;B and dance-pop. Since 2011, the Kigali Up music festival has been held annually in July or August. Artists from Rwanda and other countries perform music in a variety of styles including reggae and blues, with audiences of several thousands. Some of the musicians also give lessons to attendees during the festival. The Hobe Rwanda Festival, held in September, features music as well as dance and local art.\nFilm industry.\nA number of films about the Rwandan genocide have been filmed in Kigali, including \"100 Days\", \"Sometimes in April\", \"Shooting Dogs\" and \"Shake Hands with the Devil\". Others, such as \"Hotel Rwanda\", were set in the city but filmed in other countries. Several of the films featured survivors as cast members. Kigali also has a growing domestic film industry which began in the early 2000s with the Rwanda Film Centre, founded by journalist Eric Kabera. One of the centre's goals was to diversify the subjects covered by Rwandan films beyond the genocide theme, presenting other aspects of the country. \"Hillywood\", a portmanteau word combining Rwanda's nickname \"land of a thousand hills\" with Hollywood, was adopted to refer to the Rwanda Film Festival as well as the Rwandan film industry. \nIn 2005, Kabera inaugurated the Rwanda Film Festival, which took place annually at venues in the capital and elsewhere. The 15th edition was the last, taking place in October 2019. The festival was a competitive one, with 10 awards offered in 2012, known as the Silverback Awards.\nThe inaugural Kigali Cine Junction (also spelt Kigali CineJunction; abbreviated KCJ) film festival was held over four days in July 2023, in public places around the neighbourhoods of Nyamirambo and Biryogo. The festival was organised by Imitana Productions, a Kigali-based film production company founded by filmmakers Philbert Aim\u00e9 Mbabazi Sharangabo and Samuel Ishimwe in 2013. Most screenings took place outdoors, but also at the Cine Elmay \"Kwa Mayaka\", one of Kigali's oldest cinemas, which the organisers were hoping to revive. American director Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing\" was screened on the opening night, and Cameroonian filmmaker Jean-Pierre Bekolo was the special guest, also giving a masterclass at the festival. The festival \"aims to establish Kigali as the cinema capital of Africa, a place where audiences and professionals converge to\ndiscuss and explore the aesthetics in cinema\". It is a non-competitive festival, and also aims to bring together the local film industry with international ones, and \"celebrate and elevate Rwandan cinema\". The second edition was held in August 2024, featuring Rwandan actress Eliane Umuhire as special guest, under the theme \"Black Aesthetics\", and an expanded programme. By that time, the Cine Mayaka had been refurbished, and the screening of \"Omen\", starring Eliane Umuhire as Tshala, was held there. Yannick Mizero, a film producer at Imitana Productions, was the festival coordinator.\nSignificant days.\nOn Genocide Memorial Day, a national holiday observed every year on 7 April, the Kigali Genocide Memorial hosts \"Kwibuka\", during which the president lights a \"flame of hope\" and addresses the nation. This is followed by an official week of mourning and, on 4 July, the Liberation Day holiday.\nAlong with the rest of Rwanda, the last Saturday of each month in Kigali is \"umuganda\", a morning of mandatory community service lasting from 8am to 11am. All able-bodied people between 18 and 65 are expected to carry out community tasks such as cleaning streets or building homes for vulnerable people. Most normal services close down during \"umuganda\", and public transportation is limited.\nCuisine.\nKigali's cuisine is similar to that of the rest of the country. For those reliant on subsistence agriculture, local staple foods include bananas, plantains (known as \"ibitoke\"), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). These staple foods are also served in restaurants across the city, often as part of a \"m\u00e9lange\", a self-service buffet meal which can also include meat, chips or fish. Cassava leaves are often combined with onions and other ingredients to make a stew dish known as \"isombe\". Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef or fish. The city has restaurants serving dishes from outside the country, including Chinese, French, Indian, and Italian. Popular drinks include \"ikivuguto\", a fermented milk, and urwagwa banana beer.\nEducation.\nIn colonial and pre-genocide Rwanda, Butare was the country's principal centre for tertiary education. Early colleges such as the Nyakibanda Major Seminary, founded in 1936, and three 1960s establishments including the National University of Rwanda (UNR), were all located in the southern city. The first higher-education institution in Kigali was the Institut Africain et Mauricien de statistique et d'\u00e9conomie appliqu\u00e9e, which was founded in 1976, but the city did not become a major centre of learning until the second half of the 1990s. At that time, the public Kigali Health Institute (KHI), Kigali Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), and Kigali Institute of Education (KIE) were founded, along with private universities the Kigali Independent University (ULK) and the University of Lay Adventists of Kigali (UNILAK). Further institutions were added in Kigali in the 21st century, including the public School of Finance and Banking (SFB) in Gikondo and the private University of Kigali, as well as branches of foreign universities such as Mount Kenya University and Carnegie Mellon University's college of engineering. As of 2018, there were a total of 50,594 students enrolled at tertiary institutions in Kigali, with a total of 28 separate campuses.\nIn 2013, the government implemented significant changes in the country's public university system, intended to improve efficiency by removing duplicated courses of study and eliminating discrepancies in student assessment between the different schools. The previously independent Kigali institutions KHI, KIST, KIE and SFB were merged with three others from outside the city\u2014the UNR, Nyagatare-based Umutara Polytechnic and Ruhengeri's Higher Institute of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry\u2014creating the consolidated University of Rwanda. It has six constituent colleges, spanning nine campuses, three of which are in Kigali. These are the Gikondo campus, which serves as the university's headquarters and is home to its business and economics programmes, the Nyarugenge campus on the former KIST site, which houses the sciences, architecture and engineering, and the Remera campus which covers medicine, nursing, dentistry and health sciences.\nIn 2018 Kigali had 239 primary schools with 203,680 pupils enrolled, and 143 secondary schools with an enrolment of 60,997. The large rate of drop-out between primary and secondary, a phenomenon which occurs across Rwanda, is attributed by the Ministry of Education and UNICEF to insufficient numeracy and English skills in primary-school finishers, cost, the need for children to contribute to household labour, and insufficient teaching resources. The city's three districts occupied the top positions in the national table of exam results at primary level in 2019, although this success was not replicated at secondary level in which rural districts were the top performers. The top-three performing individual secondary schools offering the Rwandan syllabus\u2014FAWE Girls' School, Petit S\u00e9minaire St Vincent de Ndera, and Lyc\u00e9e Notre-Dame de C\u00eeteaux\u2014were all in Kigali, however. The city also has a number of private schools, which target wealthy Rwandans and expatriates, including the Green Hills Academy, \u00c9cole Belge, and the International School of Kigali. These schools, which charge high fees, offer international programmes such as the International General Certificate of Secondary Education and the International Baccalaureate which enable students to study at universities worldwide.\nOn 14 September 2022, the government announced that, starting with the academic year 2022\u20132023, parents will no longer pay school fees for students in pre-primary and primary, however, they will contribute Rwf975 for school feeding program. This will help parents with limited means be able to send their children at school.\nSport.\nThe largest sports venue in Kigali is Amahoro Stadium, in the Remera area of the city, which was built in the 1980s and has a capacity of 45,000. The stadium is used primarily for association football, playing host to most Rwanda national football team home games as well as domestic fixtures. It was one of four stadia used for fixtures in the 2016 African Nations Championship including the final, in which the Democratic Republic of the Congo beat Mali. The stadium also hosts rugby union fixtures, including those of the national team, as well as concerts and public events. The Amahoro complex includes an indoor venue, commonly known by the French name \"Petit stade\", and a Paralympic playing hall. The Kigali Arena is a 10,000-capacity indoor arena next to Amahoro Stadium, which opened in 2019. The arena hosts sports such as basketball, including the AfroBasket 2021 tournament, as well as handball, volleyball, and tennis. Other venues in the city include the 22,000-capacity Pele Stadium and the Rwanda Cricket Stadium in Gahanga, which opened in 2017. Rwanda's only golf course, the Kigali Golf Club, is based in Nyarutarama; as of 2020 it is being expanded to eighteen holes and hopes to attract regional tournaments in future.\nSeven of the sixteen teams in the association football Rwanda Premier League are based in Kigali. Most of these do not have their own stadia and play fixtures at multiple venues including Amahoro Stadium, Nyamirambo Regional Stadium and various smaller grounds. The country's two most successful teams are based in the city: APR FC, who won eighteen championships between 1969 and 2020, and Rayon Sports, who won nine in the same period. As of 2020, ten of the fourteen teams in Rwanda's National Basketball League play their home games in Kigali, with venues including Club Rafiki and the Integrated Polytechnic Regional College Kigali, as well as the Amahoro Stadium's \"Petit stade\" and the Kigali Arena. This includes the two most successful clubs Patriots BBC and Espoir BBC, who have won five and four league titles respectively.\nIn July 2025, the flagship $26 million Zaria Court complex was inaugurated in the capital. Co-founded and developed by Masai Ujiri, the project supports Rwanda\u2019s ambitious vision not only in sports and culture, but also in creativity.\nKigali was awarded hosting of the 2025 UCI Road World Championships, marking the first time the organisation's flagship event visits Africa.\nInfrastructure.\nTransportation.\nThe Rwandan government has increased investment in the transport infrastructure of Rwanda since the 1994 genocide, with aid from the United States, European Union, Japan, China, and others. Kigali is the centre of the country's road network, with paved roads linking the city to most other major cities and towns in the country. It is also connected by road to other countries in the East African Community, namely Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and Kenya, as well as to the eastern Congolese cities of Goma and Bukavu; the most important trade route for imports and exports is the road to the port of Mombasa via Kampala and Nairobi, which is known as the Northern Corridor. Within the city there was a total of of road in 2012, although only fourteen per cent of this was paved road and many of the unpaved sections were of poor quality and dangerous during rainfall. The authorities have been making gradual improvements since the 1990s, increasing the quality of the surfaces and also upgrading most of the city's arterial routes to dual-carriageway.\nCar ownership in Kigali is low, with just six per cent of households possessing one as of 2011. Therefore, most residents rely on public transport for journeys within the city and elsewhere. Historically, most passenger journeys within Kigali were in minibuses, operating under a share taxi system with sixteen passengers per bus. In the 2010s, these were phased out in many areas of the city, in favour of larger buses, some of which permit cashless payment through a \"Tap &amp; Go\" card and online bookings. Motorcycle taxis are a very popular form of private-hire vehicle, with 10,486 drivers registered with cooperatives or syndicates in 2012, a figure which is likely an underestimate. The government has announced plans to replace the country's fleet of petrol-powered motorcycles with electric vehicles, and online booking and metering has been rolled out for both motorcycles and taxicabs in recent years, such as Yego Cab and Move Ride by Volkswagen. Bicycle taxis operate in some areas of the city, being reintroduced in 2014 after a period in which they were banned.\nInternational coaches run from Nyabugogo to other destinations in East Africa. Until 2019, this included the Ugandan capital Kampala, which was reached either via Gatuna and Kabale or via Kagitumba. The journey via Gatuna on the overnight service takes around ten hours. Some Kampala services continued to Nairobi in Kenya. In 2019 the Rwanda\u2013Uganda border was closed by the Rwandan government amid a diplomatic dispute over rebel groups and the treatment of Rwandan nationals in Uganda. Some travellers began using the Rusomo Falls border crossing to reach Kampala via Tanzania, a much longer journey. As of 2020[ [update]] Rwanda has no railways, but the government has agreed with Tanzania to construct a standard-gauge railway linking Kigali to Isaka, where passengers could connect with either the Central Line or with the future Tanzania Standard Gauge Railway, to reach Dar es Salaam.\nKigali International Airport (KIA), in the eastern suburb of Kanombe, is the nation's and the city's principal airport. The busiest routes are those to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi and Entebbe International Airport, which serves Kampala; there is one domestic route, between Kigali and Kamembe Airport near Cyangugu. With capacity for growth at KIA limited, the government commissioned the new Bugesera International Airport, south-east of Kigali, with construction beginning in 2017. It will become the country's largest when it opens, complementing the existing Kigali airport. The national carrier is RwandAir, and the country is served by seven foreign airlines.\nPower.\nKigali's electricity supply was, until the early 2000s, generated almost entirely from hydroelectric sources; power stations on Lakes Burera and Ruhondo provided 90 per cent of Rwanda's electricity. A combination of below average rainfall and human activity, including the draining of the Rugezi wetlands for cultivation and grazing, caused the two lakes' water levels to fall from 1990 onwards; by 2004 levels were reduced by 50 per cent, leading to a sharp drop in output from the power stations. Coupled with this, demand had been increasing since the 1980s as the economy grew, particularly in Kigali. In 2003\u201304, the national electricity company was forced to reduce output from the power stations, necessitating widespread loadshedding. As an emergency measure, the government installed diesel generators north of the city; by 2006 these were providing 56 per cent of the country's electricity, but were very costly. Power outages remained a frequent occurrence in the late 2010s. This prompted the government and national supplier Rwanda Energy Group to invest in a programme of new peat-fired, hydroelectric, and methane power stations across Rwanda as well as the construction and repair of power lines. As of 2018, 82 per cent of Kigali's households had access to electricity, with the government targeting 100 per cent provision within seven years. Most of these households are supplied by Rwanda's wide area synchronous grid, with only between 2 and 4 per cent of households in the three districts relying on off-grid access in 2020.\nHealthcare.\nRwanda has five national referral hospitals, of which four are located in Kigali. The largest of these is the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali (UTH-K), which is governed by the Ministry of Health and receives most of its funding from the government. UTH-K has 519 beds and employs 155 personnel. Founded in 1918, it is currently in Kigali CBD, but plans to relocate to a new larger site in the Masaka area of the city. The other national referral hospitals are King Faisal Hospital, which was constructed in the late 1980s with assistance from the Saudi Fund for Development, the Rwanda Military Hospital and the Ndera Neuropsychiatric Hospital. In addition to the national hospitals, the city also contains three provincial hospitals, at Kibagabaga, Masaka, and Kacyiru. In 2021, a new 300-bed hospital opened in Nyarugenge district, designated as a specialist referral centre for COVID-19 patients.\nUnder the Twubakane Decentralisation and Health Project, responsibility for primary healthcare has moved from the national level to district level. Healthcare centres in the city are run as a mixture of public sector, government-assisted and private sector, with some traditional healers also operating. Not all residents have easy access to these facilities, however, with some having to walk more than 30 minutes to reach the nearest centre. The government has devolved the financing and management of healthcare to local communities, through a system of health insurance providers called \"mutuelles de sant\u00e9\". The \"mutuelles\" were piloted in 1999, and were made available nationwide by the mid-2000s, with the assistance of international development partners.\nMedia.\nThere are a total of eleven different terrestrial television stations broadcast in Rwanda, ten of which are domestic. All of the ten domestic channels are headquartered in Kigali. These stations are provided by two organisations\u2014the public Rwanda Broadcasting Agency (RBA), and Chinese firm StarTimes. They are broadcast from two transmitters in the Kigali area, one on Mount Jali, and one in Gasabo. In addition to the terrestrial channels, StarTimes also run a pay TV service along with two other networks, Azam and Tele10. A 2017 survey by research firm GeoPoll found that Rwanda TV is the most popular station in the country, with an audience share of 45.2 per cent, followed by TV1 with 9.3 per cent, and TV10 with 6.4 per cent. Rwanda TV was historically run by the government, but in 2013 it was transferred to the RBA.\nA number of radio stations also operate in Kigali, with transmitters located at Mount Jali and at Mount Rebero, the south of the city. The 2017 GeoPoll survey found that RBA-owned Radio Rwanda was the most popular, with 38.6 per cent of the national audience, followed by Kiss FM with 9.3 per cent and KT Radio with 7.3 per cent. All three of these are based in Kigali. Various overseas radio stations are broadcast on FM in Kigali including BBC News, Voice of America, and Deutsche Welle. A number of newspapers are published in Kigali, including \"The New Times\", the country's largest English-language publication, \"La Nouvelle Rel\u00e8ve\", in French, and Kinyarwanda papers such as \"KT Press\" and \"Imvaho Nshya\". According to international observers such as Reporters Without Borders and Freedom House, the Rwandan media does not have press freedom and is routinely censored or forced to self-censor by the government.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n \nLat.

{"id": "56691", "revid": "8766034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56691", "title": "Koror", "text": "Koror is the state comprising the main commercial centre of the Republic of Palau. It consists of several islands, the most prominent being Koror Island (also \"Oreor Island\"). It is Palau's most populous state; more people live in Koror than in the rest of Palau.\nHistory.\nIn the oral tradition of Palau, Koror is one of the children of Milad, and thus occupies an important position in traditional belief. In addition, Koror is the home of the clan of the Ibedul, the high chief of Palau. \nSeveral traditional villages in Koror span the volcanic and rock island portions. Many of the stone platforms , odesongel, serve as clan cemeteries, and other stone features serve as shrines. The lagoon is an important resource area, and was probably intensively exploited prehistorically. \nThe first sighting of Koror, Babeldaob, and Peleliu recorded by Westerners was by the Spanish expedition of Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos at the end of January, 1543. They were then charted as \"Los Arrecifes\" (The Reefs in Spanish). In November and December 1710 these three islands were again visited and explored by a Spanish missionary expedition commanded by Sargento Mayor Francisco Padilla on board the patache \"Sant\u00edsima Trinidad\". \nTwo years later they were explored in detail by the expedition of Spanish naval officer Bernardo de Egoy. He was part of the Captaincy General of the Philippines, dependent on the Viceroyalty of New Spain. In 1919 it became the capital of the South Seas Mandate. LtCol Earl Hancock Ellis, the first Director of Marine Corps Intelligence, died on Koror in May 1923. On 7 October 2006, Ngerulmud replaced Koror as Palau's capital city.\nU.S. military will upgrade Palau's Malakal harbor for American warships and a Chinese-owned hotel overlooking the Harbor could be used for surveillance.&lt;ref name=\"wapo/palau-us-china\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nGeography.\nThe state of Koror (population 11,444 as of 2015[ [update]]) contains about 65% of the population of the country. The nation's \nformer capital and largest town, also called Koror or Koror City, is located here. The town has a population of 11,200 and is located at . \nBesides Koror City and the city of Meyuns, there are a total of 11 hamlets in the state of Koror:\nKoror State stretches across a large portion of the lagoon extending from Babeldaob Island on the north almost to Beliliou Island to the south. Though widely spread, the actual land mass of Koror is not great and consists of hundreds of islands and islets including most of the Rock Islands of Palau. Koror encompasses perhaps the most varied range of geography in Micronesia with many different kinds of physical and social settings. In the northern part of the state are three volcanic islands: Koror, Ngerekebesang, and Ngemelachel.\nAcross Koror Island, the intensive land use in the last two centuries has radically altered the land's shape. Most vegetation has been cleared for house construction or put into gardens. Steep slopes have dense secondary growth brush. On Ngerekebesang Island, the land use has not been quite as intense and areas on the northwest coast contain stands of volcanic island forest. To the south, the Rock Islands offer a landscape that appears out of this world. The Rock Islands consist of uplifted coralline limestone reef with shear cliffs rising above a characteristic sea-level notch. Small beaches have formed in a few coves and provide access to the interiors. The ground is not covered by soil, but instead consists of dog-toothed sharp chunks of reef which have broken off of the crags and spires jutting skyward in an unpredictable maze. The islands are covered by a rock island forest and vines clinging to crevices in the limestone. In places, sinkholes contain marine lakes, and in other places the sinkholes contain wind-blown soil.\nPresently, most land in Koror is involved in urban development with gardens interspersed with houses and business. The Rock Islands offer valuable areas for exploiting the rich lagoon, and for the development of the tourist industry.\nKoror was formerly the capital of the South Seas Mandate, a League of Nations mandated territory administered by the Empire of Japan.\nDemography.\nIn 2015, of the 17,661 people living in Palau, 65% or 11,444 lived in Koror State. The median age was 33.5 years. The official languages of the state are Palauan and English.\nIn June 1972, the resident population was 6,032.\nEducation.\nSchools in Koror operated by the Ministry of Education include:\nEconomy.\nBelau Air has its headquarters in Koror, as did the short-lived Pacific Flier in 2010.\nTourism.\nMuch of Palau's economy comes from tourism. The Rock Islands of Palau are all located in the state. Scuba diving shops and facilities are located all over Koror. Accommodation like hotels, bars, restaurants, cafes, and resorts are all available. \"Dolphins Pacific\", the world's largest dolphin research facility, is open for tourists who are interested in swimming and interacting with trained dolphins. Most tourists to Palau stay in Koror, which is the centre for Palau's resort services and house modern conveniences. Koror has businesses that cater to speakers of many languages.\nBy 2001, the Koror Jail, Palau's only correctional facility, has become a tourist destination thanks to inmates who create and sell elaborate wooden storyboards at a retail facility located on the jail's grounds.\nThe jail consists of three structures, and it is surrounded by an eight-foot wire mesh fence and an eight-foot concrete wall.\nPolitical system.\nKoror has its own constitution, adopted in 1983. The state government was established in 1983. The state of Koror has an elected chief executive, governor. The state also has a legislature elected every four years. The state population elects one of the members of the House of Delegates of Palau.\nTransport.\nThe island of Koror is connected by bridges to three neighbouring islands:\nA main road extends through Koror along the central ridge, from the Koror-Babeldaob Bridge on the east to its western end in Medalaii. A network of secondary roads extends throughout the residential areas, and causeways connect Koror to Ngerekebesang and Ngemelachel Islands. Docking facilities are found on the northern coast in Meketii and on the southern coast in Medalaii. The major harbor facility for Palau is located on the east side of Ngemelachel Island. Malakal Harbor offers a sheltered, deep-water anchorage and has been in continual use since the 1840s. Most goods found in the many stores throughout Palau come through this port.\nClimate.\nKoror features a tropical rainforest climate under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. The town experiences an extraordinary amount of rainfall annually, averaging around of precipitation annually over 263.4 precipitation days. As with many areas with this climate type, temperatures remain relatively constant throughout the course of the year, averaging roughly . On 22 March 2018, Koror recorded a temperature of , which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Palau.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "56692", "revid": "39150892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56692", "title": "Geography of Andorra", "text": " \nAndorra is a small, landlocked country in southwestern Europe, located in the eastern Pyrenees mountain range and bordered by Spain and France. With an area of 468\u00a0km\u00b2, it is the sixth smallest country in Europe and also the largest of the European microstates.\nAndorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains, the highest being the Coma Pedrosa at , and the average elevation of Andorra is . These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream, the Gran Valira river, leaves the country for Spain (at Andorra's lowest point of ).\nAndorra's climate is similar to that of its neighbours' temperate climates, but its higher elevation means there is, on average, more snow in winter, lower humidity, and it is slightly cooler in summer. There are, on average, 300\u00a0days per year of sunshine.\nPhytogeographically, Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the WWF, the territory of Andorra belongs to the ecoregion of Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests.\nLandslides and avalanches are the main natural hazards. There are frequent earthquakes below Richter magnitude\u00a02. There is no historical record of any damaging earthquakes in Andorra, but the Andorran government has studied the possibility of a future one.\nIn Andorra forest cover is around 34% of the total land area, equivalent to 16,000 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, which was unchanged from 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 16,000 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 0 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 0% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 0% of the forest area was found within protected areas.\nMountains.\nAll of Andorra is mountainous, and in total, there are 65 mountain peaks.\nThe highest mountain is Coma Pedrosa, which rises to in the northwest of Andorra near the French and Spanish borders.\nAlong the border with France, from west to east, the highest mountains are Pic de M\u00e9d\u00e9courbe (), which is the western tripoint international boundary of Andorra, France, and Spain, Pic de Cataperdis () and Pic de Tristaina (), Pic de Font Blanca () in the northwest; Pic de Siguer (), Pic de la Serrera () and Pic d'Anrodat () in the north; and Pic de No\u00e9 (), Pic de la Cabaneta () and Roc M\u00e9l\u00e9 () in the east.\nAlong the border with Spain, from west to east, the highest mountains are Pic de M\u00e9d\u00e9courbe (), Pic de Coma Pedrosa (), Port de Cab\u00fas () and Pic dels Llacs () in the west; Pic Negre (), Torre dels Soldats (), and Pic de la Portelleta () in the south.\nIn the east, near where the borders of the two countries meet, lies Pic d\u2019Envalira () and Pic dels Pessons (). A lake, Estany de l'Estany\u00f3, and a mountain, Pic de l\u2019Estany\u00f3 () lie just east of El Serrat and are accessible only by hiking trail.\nLakes and rivers.\nAndorra is drained almost entirely by a single basin whose main river, the Gran Valira, exits the country in the south near the Spain\u2013Andorra road border crossing.\nThe Valira del Nord is the northwest tributary, flowing from near El Serrat through the settlements of Les Salines, Arans, La Cortinada, Sorn\u00e0s, Ordino, and La Massana\u2014where it meets the Tristaina River\u2014and eventually through Les Escaldes where it meets the Valira d'Orient forming the Gran Valira.\nThe Valira d'Orient is the northeast tributary, flowing from near Grau Roig through Soldeu, Canillo, Encamp, and Les Escaldes where it meets the Madriu River and then the Valira del Nord, becoming the Gran Valira.\nThere are also several much smaller drainage basins that span Andorra's borders with France and Spain. The most notable of these is the Pic de Mai\u00e0 basin whose main river, the Sant Josep, flows easterly out of the country into France and is a tributary of the Ari\u00e8ge, which is in the Garonne basin (Atlantic).\nAndorra has 172 lakes, of which the largest is Estanys de Juclar () near Pic de No\u00e9 in the north east.\nClimate.\nThe climate in Andorra varies greatly with elevation. The valleys have an oceanic climate that is similar to the temperate climate of Andorra's neighbours, but because of the higher elevation, winters tend to be more severe, the humidity lower, and summers slightly cooler. Regions above the Alpine tree line at about have an alpine climate and alpine tundra. Snow completely covers the northern valleys for several months. There are, on average, 300 days per year of sunshine. Average daily peak insolation varies from 1150\u00a0W/m2 in June to 280\u00a0W/m2 in December.\nThe average annual temperature varies from in Sant Juli\u00e0 de L\u00f2ria in the south, to in La Massana in the centre, and to in Arcalis in the north. The average daily high and low temperatures in Escaldes-Engordany are, respectively, and in July, and and in January.\nAverage annual precipitation is for the whole country, but it varies across the country, increasing with elevation and from south to north. The driest parish is Sant Juli\u00e0 de L\u00f2ria ( per year) in the south, and the wettest is Canillo ( per year) in the north. Annual precipitation can exceed the highest mountainous areas. The driest months tend to be January and February, and the wettest, May, June, and November. During the summer months, there are very few rainy days, but the rainfall can be very heavy because it is associated with thunderstorms.\nNatural hazards.\nAvalanches.\nThere is a risk of avalanches from mid winter to early summer. Avalanche control methods such as snow clearing by controlled blast charges, snow nets, snow fences, deflectors, rigid barriers, and snow compaction are used in Andorra to prevent dangerous avalanches.\n1996 Arinsal avalanche.\nThe 1996 Arinsal avalanche was an exceptionally powerful powder-snow avalanche that followed several days of very heavy snowfalls and high winds. At 19:00 on 8 February 1996, the avalanche fell on the village of Arinsal destroying or severely damaging many cars and buildings and hotels including the crest hotel the rocky mountain bar and above apartments the asterics bar and little damage to three blocks of flats that were under construction by a Russian company and still are under construction; evacuation of the residents and tourists in the village had been completed 1\u00bd\u00a0hours before the avalanche, and consequently there were no deaths, but the material and economic damages were large. Afterwards, the government ordered the construction of a snow dam across the Arinsal valley to stop future avalanches. The Arinsal snow dam, which is high and wide, cost 52\u00a0million francs and used of soil and of rock.\n1970 Pas de la Casa avalanche.\nThe 1970 Pas de la Casa avalanche was a powder-snow avalanche that happened after a severe snowstorm left of new snow atop the existing snow pack on the mountain slopes above Pas de la Casa. The avalanche began at an elevation of on the upper slopes of the Pic d'Envalira (), accelerated down the 35\u00b0\u00a0slope and spilled over six bends of the old CG-2 road that winds its way down the mountain to the village of Pas de la Casa, which is at . It then hit the village, damaging several buildings including a dispensary and killing a nurse. In 1970, Pas de la Casa had far fewer buildings than it does now, so the damage was relatively limited. In later years as development of the ski resort continued, plans for avalanche control measures were studied, but it was not until 1985 that strong protective features including of windbreaks and of snow fences were installed. The new CG-2 goes through the Envalira Tunnel, thus avoiding Pas de la Casa and the risk of avalanches.\nLandslides.\nLandslides are a frequent occurrence in Andorra; they have tended to follow periods of heavy rainfall.\nA landslide during the evening rush hour on 25 January 2008 deposited of loosely bound soil and rocks from the mountain slope above onto the main road CG-3 (Avinguda del Trav\u00e9s de la Massana) between La Massana and Ordino, blocking it for three days, as well as completely covering an open-air car park and several parked cars. The only damage was to property, and nobody was injured, but the residents of a block of flats adjacent to the landslide were evacuated as the building was deemed unsafe and it remains vacant. The cause of the landslide was determined to be settlement of the earth due to inadequate ground reinforcement in the construction and excavation of the car park 30\u00a0years previously.\nOn 7 July 2009, a rock landslide fell onto the CG-3 main road between La Massana and Andorra La Vella, blocking the road near the entrance to the Pont Pla Tunnel for three hours. Protective nets on the mountain side caught most of the rockfall, but went over the nets and fell onto the road and pavement.\nEarthquakes.\nThe Pyrenees and Catalonia have frequent and sometimes destructive earthquakes \u2014 the largest in recorded history being the Catalan earthquake of 1428 with an estimated magnitude of IX on the MSK scale, equivalent to 6.0\u20136.5 on the Richter magnitude scale. However, earthquakes whose epicentres are inside Andorra tend to be smaller than magnitude\u00a02. An earthquake of magnitude 4.2 on 5 October 1999 in nearby Bagn\u00e8res-de-Luchon (France) was widely felt in Andorra, causing public alarm. The Andorran Government has studied the possibility of a damaging earthquake in Andorra.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "56695", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56695", "title": "Geography of Mexico", "text": " \nThe geography of Mexico describes the geographic features of Mexico, a country in the Americas. Mexico is located at about 23\u00b0 N and 102\u00b0 W in the southern portion of North America. From its farthest land points, Mexico is a little over in length. Mexico is bounded to the north by the United States (specifically, from west to east, by California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas), to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, to the east by the Gulf of Mexico, and to the southeast by Belize, Guatemala, and the Caribbean Sea. The northernmost constituent of Latin America, it is the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world. Mexico is the world's 13th largest country, three times the size of Texas.\nAlmost all of Mexico is on the North American Plate, with small parts of the Baja California Peninsula in the northwest on the Pacific and Cocos Plates. Some geographers include the portion east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec including the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula within North America. This portion includes Campeche, Chiapas, Tabasco, Quintana Roo, and Yucat\u00e1n, representing 12.1 percent of the country's total area. Alternatively, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt may be said to delimit the region physiographically on the north. Geopolitically, Mexico is generally not considered part of Central America. Politically, Mexico is divided into thirty-two states.\nAs well as numerous neighbouring islands, Mexican territory includes the more remote Isla Guadalupe and the Islas Revillagigedo in the Pacific. Mexico's total area covers 1,972,550 square kilometers, including approximately 6,000 square kilometers of islands in the Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of California. On its north, Mexico shares a 5,000-kilometer border with the United States. The meandering R\u00edo Bravo del Norte (known as the Rio Grande in the United States) defines the border from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez east to the Gulf of Mexico. A series of natural and artificial markers delineate the United States-Mexican border west from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to the Pacific Ocean. The Mexico-U.S. boundary is jointly administered by the International Boundary and Water Commission. On its south, Mexico shares an 871 kilometer border with Guatemala and a 251-kilometer border with Belize.\nMexico has a 9,330-kilometer coastline, of which 7,338 kilometers face the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California, and the remaining 2,805 kilometers front the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. Mexico's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) covers and is the 13th largest in the world. It extends nautical miles off each coast. The landmass of Mexico dramatically narrows as it moves in a southeasterly direction from the United States border and then abruptly curves northward before ending in the 500-kilometer-long Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Indeed, the state capital of Yucat\u00e1n, M\u00e9rida, is farther north than Mexico City or Guadalajara.\nPhysical features.\nMountain ranges and elevations.\nBeginning approximately from the United States border, the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range extends about south to the R\u00edo Santiago, where it merges with the Cordillera Neovolc\u00e1nica range that runs east\u2013west across central Mexico. The Sierra Madre Occidental lies approximately inland from the west coast of Mexico at its northern end, and approaches to within fifty kilometers of the coast near the Cordillera Neovolc\u00e1nica. The northwest coastal plain is the name given the lowland area between the Sierra Madre Occidental and the Gulf of California. The Sierra Madre Occidental averages in elevation, with peaks reaching .\nThe Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range starts at the Big Bend region of the border with the U.S. state of Texas and continues until reaching Cofre de Perote, one of the major peaks of the Cordillera Neovolc\u00e1nica. As is the case with the Sierra Madre Occidental, the Sierra Madre Oriental comes progressively closer to the coastline as it approaches its southern terminus, reaching to within of the Gulf of Mexico. The northeast coastal plain extends from the eastern slope of the Sierra Madre Oriental to the Gulf of Mexico. The median elevation of the Sierra Madre Oriental is , with some peaks at .\nThe Mexican Altiplano, stretching from the United States border to the Cordillera Neovolc\u00e1nica, occupies the vast expanse of land between the eastern and western sierra madres. A low east\u2013west range divides the altiplano into northern and southern sections. These two sections, previously called the Mesa del Norte and Mesa Central, are now regarded by geographers as sections of one altiplano. The northern altiplano averages 1,100 meters in elevation and continues south from the R\u00edo Bravo del Norte through the states of Zacatecas and San Luis Potos\u00ed. \nNarrow, isolated ridges cross the plateaus of the northern altiplano. Numerous depressions dot the region, the largest of which is the Bols\u00f3n de Mapim\u00ed. The southern Altiplano is higher than its northern counterpart, averaging in elevation. The southern altiplano contains numerous valleys originally formed by ancient lakes. Several of Mexico's most prominent cities, including Mexico City and Guadalajara, are located in the valleys of the southern Altiplano.\nOne other significant mountain range, the Peninsular Ranges, cuts across the landscape of the northern half of Mexico. A southern extension of the California coastal ranges that parallel California's coast, the Mexican portion of the Peninsular Ranges extends from the United States border to the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula, a distance of . Peaks in the California system range in altitude from in the north to only near La Paz in the south. \nNarrow lowlands are found on the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California sides of the mountains. The Cordillera Neovolc\u00e1nica is a belt long and wide, extending from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. The Cordillera Neovolc\u00e1nica begins at the R\u00edo Grande de Santiago and continues south to Colima, where it turns east along the nineteenth parallel to the central portion of the state of Veracruz. \nThe region is distinguished by considerable seismic activity and contains Mexico's highest volcanic peaks. This range contains three peaks exceeding : Pico de Orizaba (Citlalt\u00e9petl)\u2014the third highest mountain in North America\u2014and Popocat\u00e9petl and Iztacc\u00edhuatl near Mexico City. The Cordillera Neovolc\u00e1nica is regarded as the geological dividing line between North America and Central America.\nSeveral important mountain ranges dominate the landscape of southern and southeastern Mexico. The Sierra Madre del Sur extends 1,200 kilometers along Mexico's southern coast from the southwestern part of the Cordillera Neovolc\u00e1nica to the nearly flat isthmus of Tehuantepec. Mountains in this range average 2,000 meters in elevation. The range averages 100 kilometers wide, but widens to 150 kilometers in the state of Oaxaca. The narrow southwest coastal plain extends from the Sierra Madre del Sur to the Pacific Ocean. \nThe Sierra Madre de Oaxaca begins at Pico de Orizaba and extends in a southeasterly direction for 300 kilometers until reaching the isthmus of Tehuantepec. Peaks in the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca average 2,500 meters in elevation, with some peaks exceeding 3,000 meters. South of the isthmus of Tehuantepec, the Sierra Madre de Chiapas runs 280 kilometers along the Pacific Coast from the Oaxaca-Chiapas border to Mexico's border with Guatemala. Although average elevation is only 1,500 meters, one peak\u2014Volc\u00e1n de Tacuma\u2014exceeds 4,000 meters in elevation. The Meseta Central de Chiapas extends 250 kilometers through the central part of Chiapas to Guatemala. The average height of peaks of the Meseta Central de Chiapas is 2,000 meters. The Chiapas central valley separates the Meseta Central de Chiapas and the Sierra Madre de Chiapas.\nRivers and other bodies of water.\nMexico has nearly 150 rivers, two-thirds of which empty into the Pacific Ocean and the remainder of which flow into the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean Sea. Despite this apparent abundance of water, water volume is unevenly distributed throughout the country. Indeed, five rivers\u2014the Usumacinta, Grijalva, Papaloap\u00e1n, Coatzacoalcos, and P\u00e1nuco\u2014account for 52 percent of Mexico's average annual volume of surface water. \nAll five rivers flow into the Gulf of Mexico. Only the R\u00edo P\u00e1nuco is outside southeastern Mexico, which contains approximately 15 percent of national territory and 12 percent of the national population. In contrast, northern and central Mexico, with 47 percent of the national area and almost 60 percent of Mexico's population, have less than 10 percent of the country's water resources.\nIn 2024, a team of oceanographers discovered the world's deepest blue hole, Taam Ja, meaning 'deep waters' in Mayan, in Chetumal Bay, Mexico. Due to technical limitations, the actual depth of the hole is still unknown. The findings suggest the presence of a complex labyrinth of underground caves and tunnels, which could shed new light on the site and the diversity of life within it.\nSeismic activity.\nSituated atop three of the large tectonic plates that constitute the Earth's surface, Mexico is one of the most seismologically active regions on Earth. The motion of these plates causes earthquakes and volcanic activity.\nMost of the Mexican landmass rests on the westward moving North American plate. The Pacific Ocean floor off southern Mexico, however, is being carried northeast by the underlying motion of the Cocos Plate. Ocean floor material is relatively dense; when it strikes the lighter granite of the Mexican landmass, the ocean floor is forced under the landmass, creating the deep Middle America Trench that lies off Mexico's southern coast. \nThe westward moving land atop the North American plate is slowed and crumpled where it meets the Cocos plate, creating the mountain ranges of southern Mexico. The subduction of the Cocos plate accounts for the frequency of earthquakes near Mexico's southern coast. As the rocks constituting the ocean floor are forced down, they melt, and the molten material is forced up through weaknesses in the surface rock, creating the volcanoes in the Cordillera Neovolc\u00e1nica across central Mexico.\nAreas of Mexico's coastline on the Gulf of California, including the Baja California Peninsula, are riding northwestward on the Pacific plate. Rather than one plate subducting, the Pacific and North American plates grind past each other, creating a slip fault that is the southern extension of the San Andreas Fault in California. Motion along this fault in the past pulled Baja California away from the coast, creating the Gulf of California. Continued motion along this fault is the source of earthquakes in western Mexico.\nMexico has a long history of destructive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In September 1985, an earthquake measuring 8.0 on the moment magnitude scale and centered in the subduction zone off Acapulco killed more than 4,000 people in Mexico City, more than 300 kilometers away. Volc\u00e1n de Colima, south of Guadalajara, erupted in 1994, and El Chich\u00f3n, in southern Mexico, underwent a violent eruption in 1983. Par\u00edcutin in northwest Mexico began as puffs of smoke in a cornfield in 1943; a decade later the volcano was 424 meters high. \nAlthough dormant for decades, Popocat\u00e9petl and Iztacc\u00edhuatl (\"smoking warrior\" and \"white lady,\" respectively, in Nahuatl) occasionally send out puffs of smoke clearly visible in Mexico City, a reminder to the capital's inhabitants that volcanic activity is near. Popocat\u00e9petl showed renewed activity in 1995 and 1996, forcing the evacuation of several nearby villages and causing concern by seismologists and government officials about the effect that a large-scale eruption might have on the heavily populated region nearby.\nClimate.\nThe Tropic of Cancer effectively divides the country into temperate and tropical zones. Land north of the twenty-fourth parallel experiences cooler temperatures during the winter months. South of the twenty-fourth parallel, temperatures are fairly constant year round and vary solely as a function of elevation.\nAreas south of the twentieth-fourth parallel with elevations up to (the southern parts of both coastal plains as well as the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula), have a yearly median temperature between . Temperatures here remain high throughout the year, with only a difference between winter and summer median temperatures. Although low-lying areas north of the twentieth-fourth parallel are hot and humid during the summer, they generally have lower yearly temperature averages (from ) because of more moderate conditions during the winter.\nBetween , one encounters yearly average temperatures between . Towns and cities at this elevation south of the twenty-fourth parallel have relatively constant, pleasant temperatures throughout the year, whereas more northerly locations experience sizeable seasonal variations. Above , temperatures drop as low as an average yearly range between in the Cordillera Neovolc\u00e1nica. \nAt , Mexico City has a yearly median temperature of with pleasant summers and mild winters. Average daily highs and lows for May, the warmest month, are , and average daily highs and lows for January, the coldest month, are . Rainfall varies widely both by location and season. \nArid or semiarid conditions are encountered in the Baja California Peninsula, the northwestern state of Sonora, the northern altiplano, and also significant portions of the southern altiplano. Rainfall in these regions averages between per year, although even less in some areas, particularly in the state of Baja California. Average rainfall totals are between in most of the major populated areas of the southern altiplano, including Mexico City and Guadalajara. \nLow-lying areas along the Gulf of Mexico receive in excess of of rainfall in an average year, with the wettest region being the southeastern state of Tabasco, which typically receives approximately of rainfall on an annual basis. Parts of the northern altiplano, highlands and high peaks in the Sierra Madres receive yearly snowfall. Citlalt\u00e9petl, Popocat\u00e9petl and Iztacc\u00edhuatl continue to support glaciers, the largest of which is the Gran Glaciar Norte.\nMexico has pronounced wet and dry seasons. Most of the country experiences a rainy season from June to mid-October and significantly less rain during the remainder of the year. February and July generally are the driest and wettest months, respectively. Mexico City, for example, receives an average of only of rain during February but more than in July. \nCoastal areas, especially those along the Gulf of Mexico, experience the largest amounts of rain in September. Tabasco typically records more than of rain during that month. A small coastal area of northwestern coastal Mexico around Tijuana has a Mediterranean climate with considerable coastal fog and a rainy season that occurs in winter.\nMexico lies squarely within the hurricane belt, and all regions of both coasts are susceptible to these storms from June through November. Hurricanes on the Pacific coast are often less violent than those affecting Mexico's eastern coastline. Several hurricanes per year strike the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico coastline, however, and these storms bring high winds, heavy rain, extensive damage, and occasional loss of life. Hurricane Gilbert passed directly over Canc\u00fan in September 1988, with winds in excess of , producing major damage to hotels in the resort area. It then struck northeast Mexico, where flooding from the heavy rain killed dozens in the Monterrey area and caused extensive damage to livestock and vegetable crops.\nEnvironmental conditions.\nMexico faces significant environmental challenges damaging nearly all sections of the country. Vast expanses of southern and southeastern tropical forests have been denuded due to mineral resource extraction, and then, far behind in second place, for cattle-raising and agriculture. For example, tropical forests covered almost half of the state of Tabasco in 1940 but less than 10% by the late 1980s. During the same period, pastureland increased from 20 to 60% of the state's total area. \nAnalysts reported similar conditions in other tropical sections of Mexico. Deforestation and desertification has contributed to serious levels of soil erosion nationwide. In 1985 the government classified almost 17% of all land as totally eroded, 31% in an accelerated state of erosion, and 38% demonstrating signs of incipient erosion. Mexico has developed a Biodiversity Action Plan to address issues of endangered species and habitats that merit protection.\nSoil destruction is particularly pronounced in the north and northwest, with more than 60% of land considered in a total or accelerated state of erosion. Fragile because of its semiarid and arid character, the soil of the region has become increasingly damaged through excessive cattle-raising and irrigation with waters containing high levels of salinity. The result is a mounting problem of desertification throughout the region.\nMexico's vast coastline faces a different, but no less difficult, series of environmental problems. For example, inadequately regulated petroleum exploitation in the Coatzacoalcos-Minatitl\u00e1n zone in the Gulf of Mexico has caused serious damage to the waters and fisheries of R\u00edo Coatzacoalcos. The deadly explosion that racked a working-class neighborhood in Guadalajara in April 1992 serves as an appropriate symbol of environmental damage in Mexico. More than of gasoline seeped from a corroded Mexican Petroleum (Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos\u2014Pemex) pipeline into the municipal sewer system, where it combined with gases and industrial residuals to produce a massive explosion that killed 190 persons and injured nearly 1,500 others. \nMexico's tourism industry impacts the environment but this can be reduced. Carmona-Morena et al. 2004 &amp; S\u00e1nchez-Medina et al. 2015 find Mexico's environmental enforcement in the tourism sector varies between little and nonexistent. S\u00e1nchez-Medina finds some change toward environmentally benign practices still occurs but is voluntary and has motives other than financial reward or fear of enforcement. They also find that such progress is slowed by the lack of financial wherewithal these tourism enterprises have.\nMexico City confronts authorities with perhaps their most daunting environmental challenge. Geography and extreme population levels have combined to produce one of the world's most polluted urban areas. Mexico City sits in a valley surrounded on three sides by mountains, which serve to trap contaminants produced by the metropolitan area's 15 million residents. \nA government study in the late 1980s determined that nearly 5 million tons of contaminants were emitted annually in the atmosphere, a tenfold increase over the previous decade. Carbons and hydrocarbons from the region's more than 3 million vehicles account for approximately 80% of these contaminants, with another 15%, primarily of sulfur and nitrogen, coming from industrial plants. The resulting dangerous mix is responsible for a wide range of respiratory illnesses. \nA study of twelve urban areas worldwide in the mid-1980s concluded that the residents of Mexico City had the highest levels of lead and cadmium in their blood. The volume of pollutants from Mexico City has damaged the surrounding ecosystem as well. For example, wastewater from Mexico City that flows north and is used for irrigation in the state of Hidalgo has been linked to congenital birth defects and high levels of gastrointestinal diseases in that state.\nBeginning in the mid-1980s, the government enacted numerous antipollution policies in Mexico City with varied degrees of success. Measures such as vehicle emissions inspections, the introduction of unleaded gasoline, and the installation of catalytic converters on new vehicles helped reduce pollution generated by trucks and buses. In contrast, one of the government's most prominent actions, the No Driving Day program, may have inadvertently contributed to higher pollution levels. \nUnder the program, metropolitan area residents were prohibited from driving their vehicles one day each work week based on the last number of their license plate. Those with the resources to do so purchased additional automobiles to use on the day their principal vehicle was prohibited from driving, adding to the region's vehicle stock. Thermal inversions reached such dangerous levels at various times in the mid-1990s that the government declared pollution emergencies, necessitating sharp temporary cutbacks in vehicle use and industrial production.\nMexico had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.82/10, ranking it 63rd globally out of 172 countries.\nGeneral indicators.\nClimate: varies from tropical to desert.\nTerrain: high, rugged mountains; low coastal plains; high plateaus; desert.\nElevation extremes:\nNatural resources: petroleum, silver, copper, gold, lead, zinc, natural gas and timber.\nLand use:\nIrrigated land: 64,600\u00a0km2 (2009)\nTotal renewable water resources: 457.2\u00a0km3\nNatural hazards:\nTsunamis and tropical cyclones along the Pacific coast, volcanoes and destructive earthquakes in the center and south, and hurricanes on the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean coasts.\n&lt;br&gt;\"volcanism:\" volcanic activity in the central-southern part of the country; the volcanoes in Baja California are mostly dormant; Colima (elev. 3,850 m), which erupted in 2010, is Mexico's most active volcano and is responsible for causing periodic evacuations of nearby villagers; it has been deemed a \"Decade Volcano\" by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, worthy of study due to its explosive history and close proximity to human populations; Popocatepetl (elev. 5,426 m) poses a threat to Mexico City; other historically active volcanoes include Barcena, Ceboruco, El Chichon, Michoacan-Guanajuato, Pico de Orizaba, San Martin, Socorro, and Tacana\nEnvironment \u2013 current issues: \nNatural fresh water resources scarce and polluted in north, inaccessible and poor quality in center and extreme southeast; raw sewage and industrial effluents polluting rivers in urban areas; deforestation; widespread erosion; desertification; serious air pollution in the national capital and urban centers along the US-Mexico border; land subsidence in Valley of Mexico caused by groundwater depletion.\nEnvironment \u2013 international agreements: Party to: biodiversity, climate change, climate change-Kyoto Protocol, desertification, endangered species, hazardous wastes, law of the sea, marine dumping, marine life conservation, lzone layer protection, ship pollution, wetlands, whaling.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are 2 seasons: a warm humid summer from November to April, with a mean temperature of and a cooler dry winter from June to September with a mean temperature of . The temperature difference between the seasons is only 4.3\u00b0C (7.7\u00b0F). The warmest months are January and February with average day maximum temperature reaching and the coolest months are July and August with average overnight minimum temperatures of . Annual rainfall ranges from on the coast to on the central plateau. Although there is no marked rainy season, most of the rainfall occurs in the summer months. Sea temperature in the lagoon varies from . The central plateau is much cooler than the surrounding coastal areas and can experience as much as twice the rainfall. The prevailing trade winds keep the east side of the island cooler and bring more rain. \nOccasional tropical cyclones generally occur between January and March and tend to disrupt the weather for about three days, bringing heavy rain. Anticyclones affect the country during May to September. Hollanda (1994) and Dina (2002) were the worst two recent cyclones to have affected the island.\nClimate change.\nMauritius is increasingly vulnerable to climate change, facing rising temperatures, sea levels, and more frequent extreme weather events. The island faces stronger tropical cyclones, prolonged droughts, flash floods, landslides, and marine heatwaves which leading to coral bleaching. Coastal erosion, driven by rising sea levels, threatens infrastructure and freshwater supplies. Climate change is also impacting key sectors such as tourism and fisheries, with significant economic consequences. To adapt, Mauritius is implementing disaster preparedness measures, protecting coastal ecosystems like mangroves, and raising public awareness.\nMauritius contributes approximately 0.01% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The country has pledged to cut emissions by 40% by 2030 compared to projected levels without intervention, with a goal of reaching net zero by 2070. As part of its climate change strategy, Mauritius plans to eliminate coal from electricity generation by 2030, reduce landfill waste by diverting 70% of it through a circular economy approach, and increase the share of electric vehicles to 15% by the same year.\nTerrain.\nThe country's landscape consists of a small coastal plain rising to discontinuous mountains encircling a central plateau.

{"id": "56698", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56698", "title": "Geography of Mauritania", "text": " \nMauritania, a country in the Western Region of the continent of Africa, is generally flat, its 1,030,700 square kilometres forming vast, arid plains broken by occasional ridges and clifflike outcroppings. Mauritania is the world\u2019s largest country lying entirely below an altitude of . It borders the North Atlantic Ocean, between Senegal and Western Sahara, Mali and Algeria. It is considered part of both the Sahel and the Maghreb. A series of scarps face southwest, longitudinally bisecting these plains in the center of the country. The scarps also separate a series of sandstone plateaus, the highest of which is the Adrar Plateau, reaching an elevation of . Spring-fed oases lie at the foot of some of the scarps. Isolated peaks, often rich in minerals, rise above the plateaus; the smaller peaks are called \"Guelbs\" and the larger ones \"Kedias\". The concentric Guelb er Richat is a prominent feature of the north-central region. Kediet ej Jill, near the city of Zou\u00eer\u00e2t, has an elevation of and is the highest peak.\nApproximately three-fourths of Mauritania is desert or semidesert. As a result of extended, severe drought, the desert has been expanding since the mid-1960s. The plateaus gradually descend toward the northeast to the barren El Djouf, or \"Empty Quarter,\" a vast region of large sand dunes that merges into the Sahara Desert. To the west, between the ocean and the plateaus, are alternating areas of clayey plains (regs) and sand dunes (ergs), some of which shift from place to place, gradually moved by high winds. The dunes generally increase in size and mobility toward the north.\nBelts of natural vegetation, corresponding to the rainfall pattern, extend from east to west and range from traces of tropical forest along the S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River to brush and savanna in the southeast. Only sandy desert is found in the centre and north of the country.\nClimate.\nThe climate is characterized by extremes in temperature and by meager and irregular rainfall. Annual temperature variations are small, although diurnal variations can be extreme. The harmattan, a hot, dry, and often dust-laden wind, blows from the Sahara throughout the long dry season and is the prevailing wind, except along the narrow coastal strip, which is influenced by oceanic trade winds. Most rain falls during the short rainy season (hivernage), from July to September, and average annual precipitation varies from in the far south to less than in the northern two-thirds of the country.\nMajor geographic and climate zones.\nMauritania has four ecological zones: the Saharan Zone, the Sahelian Zone, the Senegal River Valley, and the Coastal Zone. Although the zones are markedly different from one another, no natural features clearly delineate the boundaries between them. Sand, varying in color and composition, covers 40 percent of the surface of the country, forming dunes that appear in all zones except the Senegal River Valley. Fixed sand dunes are composed of coarse, fawn-colored sand, while shifting (\"mobile\") dunes consist of fine, dustlike, reddish-colored sands that can be carried by the wind. Plateaus generally are covered with heavier blue, gray, and black sands that form a crusty surface over layers of soft, loose sand.\nSaharan zone.\nThe Saharan Zone makes up the northern two-thirds of the country. Its southern boundary corresponds to the isohyet (a line on the Earth's surface along which the rainfall is the same) that represents annual precipitation of . Rain usually falls during the hivernage, which lasts from July to September. Often, isolated storms drop large amounts of water in short periods of time. A year, or even several years, may pass without any rain in some locations.\nDiurnal variations in temperature in the Saharan Zone may be extreme, although annual variations are minimal. During December and January, temperatures range from an early morning low of to a midafternoon high of . During May, June, and July, temperatures range from in the morning to more than by afternoon. Throughout the year, the harmattan often causes blinding sandstorms.\nThe administrative regions (formerly called cercles) of Tiris Zemmour in the north, Adrar in the center, and northern Hodh ech Chargui in the east, which make up most of the Saharan Zone, are vast empty stretches of dunes alternating with granite outcroppings. After a rain, or in the presence of a well, these outcroppings may support vegetation. In the populated Adrar and Tagant plateaus, springs and wells provide water for pasturage and some agriculture. In the western portion of the Saharan Zone, extending toward Nouakchott, rows of sand dunes are aligned from northeast to southwest in ridges from two to twenty kilometres wide. Between these ridges are depressions filled with limestone and clayey sand capable of supporting vegetation after a rain. Dunes in the far north shift with the wind more than those in the south.\nThe Saharan Zone has little vegetation. Some mountainous areas with a water source support small-leafed and spiny plants and scrub grasses suitable for camels. Because seeds of desert plants can remain dormant for many years, dunes often sprout sparse vegetation after a rain. In depressions between dunes, where the water is nearer the surface, some flora\u2014including acacias, soapberry trees, capers, and swallowwort\u2014may be found. Saline areas have a particular kind of vegetation, mainly chenopods, which are adapted to high salt concentrations in the soil. Cultivation is limited to oases, where date palms are used to shade other crops from the sun.\nSahelian zone.\nThe Sahelian Zone extends south of the Saharan Zone to within approximately 30 kilometres of the Senegal River. It forms an east\u2013west belt with its axis running from Boutilimit through 'Ayo\u00fbn el 'Atro\u00fbs to N\u00e9ma, including the Aoukar basin. The area is mostly made up of steppes and savanna grasslands. Herds of cattle, sheep, and goats move across this zone in search of pasturage.\nThe hivernage begins earlier in the Sahelian Zone than in the Saharan Zone, often lasting from June until October. Because farmers and herders depend on annual rains, a delay of one month in the beginning of the rainy season can cause large losses and lead to mass migrations from Hodh ech Chargui and Hodh el Gharbi into Mali. Although temperature extremes are narrower than in the Saharan Zone, daily variations range from . The harmattan is the prevailing wind.\nIn the northern Sahel, dunes are covered with scrub grasses and spiny acacia trees. Farther south, greater rainfall permits denser vegetation. Sands begin to give way to clay. Large date palm plantations are found on the Tagant Plateau, and savanna grasses, brushwood, balsam, and spurge cover fixed dunes. Occasional baobab trees dot the flat savanna grasslands of the southern Sahel. Forest areas contain palm trees and baobabs. Vast forests of gum-bearing acacia grow in Trarza and Brakna regions. Farther south, particularly in Assaba and the northern portion of Guidimaka regions, rainfall is high enough to support forms of sedentary agriculture.\nSenegal River Valley.\nThe Senegal River Valley, sometimes known as the Chemama or the pre-Sahel, is a narrow belt of land that extends north of the Senegal River. Before the droughts of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, the belt ranged from north of the river. By the late 1980s, desertification had reached the northern bank of the river in some parts of the valley. The valley is wider in Guidimaka Region and is completely dominated by the seasonal cycle of the river. Almost all of the valley's economically active population engages in sedentary agriculture or fishing along the Senegal River and its main tributaries\u2014the Karakoro, the Gorgol, and the Garfa. This area supplies most of the country's agricultural production.\nThe climate of the Senegal River Valley contrasts with that of the Saharan and Sahelian zones. Rainfall is higher than in other regions, ranging from annually, usually between May and September. This rainfall, combined with annual flooding of the river, provides the basis for agriculture. Temperatures are cooler and subject to less annual and diurnal variation than in other regions.\nThe Senegal is the only permanent river between southern Morocco and central Senegal. From its source in Guinea, it flows north and west , reaching the Atlantic Ocean at Saint Louis, Senegal. From its mouth, the river is navigable as far as Kayes, Mali, during the rainy season and Podor, Senegal, during the rest of the year. Heavy rains, beginning in April in Guinea and May and June in Senegal and Mali, bring annual floods. These floods cover the entire valley up to a width of , filling numerous lakes and sloughs (marigots) that empty back into the river during the dry season. A notable example of these is Lake R'Kiz. When the waters recede from the bottomlands, planting begins.\nThe Senegal River Valley, with its rich alluvial and clayey soil, is comparatively abundant in flora. Moreover, higher rainfall, irrigation, and abundant side channels and sloughs tend to produce a lush, near-tropical vegetation, with baobab and gonakie trees and abundant rich grasses. Ddounm and barussus palms are also found here. Much of the flood plain is cultivated.\nCoastal zone.\nThe Coastal Zone, or Sub-Canarian Zone, extends the length of the approximately long Atlantic coast. Prevailing oceanic trade winds from the Canary Islands modify the influence of the harmattan, producing a humid but temperate climate. Rainfall here is minimal; in Nouadhibou it averages 30\u00a0 mm annually and occurs between July and September. Temperatures are moderate, varying from mean maximums of for Nouadhibou and Nouakchott, respectively, to mean minimums of .\nBattering surf and shifting sand banks characterize the entire length of the shoreline. The Ras Nouadhibou (formerly known as Cap Blanc) peninsula, which forms Dakhlet Nouadhibou (formerly L\u00e9vrier Bay) to the east, is long and 13\u00a0km wide. The peninsula is administratively divided between Western Sahara and Mauritania, with the Mauritanian port and railhead of Nouadhibou located on the eastern shore. Dakhlet Nouadhibou, one of the largest natural harbours on the west coast of Africa, is long and wide at its broadest point. Fifty kilometres southeast of Ras Nouadhibou is Arguin. In 1455 the first Portuguese installation south of Cape Bojador (in the present-day Western Sahara) was established at Arguin. Farther south is the coastline's only significant promontory, -high Cape Timiris. From this cape to the marshy area around the mouth of the Senegal River, the coast is regular and marked only by an occasional high dune.\nOn coastal dunes vegetation is rare. At the foot of ridges, however, large tamarisk bushes, dwarf acacias, and swallowworts may be found. Some high grass, mixed with balsam, spurge, and spiny shrubs, grows in the central region. The north has little vegetation.\nA recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 494\u00a0km2 of tidal flats in Mauritania, making it the 48th ranked country in terms of tidal flat area.\nExpansion of the desert.\nThe climate has altered drastically since the onset of the prolonged drought in the 1960s, part of a recurrent pattern of wet and dry cycles common to Sahelian Africa. Experts agree, however, that overgrazing, deforestation, denuding of ground cover around wells, poor farming methods, and overpopulation have aggravated the drought. In Mauritania the isohyet indicating annual rainfall of 150 millimetres\u2014considered the minimum for pastoralism\u2014has shifted southward about 100 kilometres to a point well south of Nouakchott. During the 1980s, the desert was advancing southward at an estimated rate of six kilometres a year. Each major climatic zone had shifted southward, and in some cases near-desert conditions had reached the banks of the Senegal River.\nBy the late 1980s, desertification had fundamentally altered agro-pastoral and human settlement patterns. Loss of ground cover in the Sahelian Zone had driven animals and people southward in search of food and water and had given rise to new fields of sand dunes. The advancing dunes threatened to engulf wells, villages, and roads; they had even invaded Nouakchott on their march to the sea. The government secured international help to stabilize the dune field around Nouakchott and planted 250,000 palm trees to create a barrier against the encroaching desert. To further combat desiccation, the government constructed dams on the Senegal River and its tributaries to increase the amount of cultivable land.\nArea and boundaries.\nArea.\n\"total:\"\n&lt;br&gt;\"land:\"\n&lt;br&gt;\"water:\"\nLand boundaries.\n\"total:\"\n\"border countries:\"\nAlgeria , Mali , Senegal , Western Sahara \nMaritime claims.\n\"territorial sea:\"\n\"contiguous zone:\"\n&lt;br&gt;\"continental shelf:\"\n or to the edge of the continental margin\n&lt;br&gt;\"exclusive economic zone:\"\nElevation extremes.\n\"lowest point:\"\nSebkha de Ndrhamcha \n&lt;br&gt;\"highest point:\"\nKediet ej Jill \nResources and Land use.\nNatural resources.\niron ore, gypsum, copper, phosphate, diamonds, gold, oil, fish\nLand use.\n\"arable land:\"\n0.44%\n&lt;br&gt;\"permanent crops:\"\n0.01%\n&lt;br&gt;\"other:\"\n99.55% (2011)\nIrrigated land.\n450.1\u00a0km2 (2004)\nTotal renewable water resources.\n11.4\u00a0km3\nEnvironmental concerns.\nNatural hazards.\nhot, dry, dust/sand-laden sirocco wind blows primarily in March and April; periodic droughts\nEnvironment \u2013 current issues.\novergrazing, deforestation, and soil erosion aggravated by drought are contributing to desertification; very limited natural fresh water resources away from the Senegal which is the only perennial river; locust infestation\nEnvironment \u2013 international agreements.\n\"party to:\"\nBiodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands, Whaling\n&lt;br&gt;\"signed, but not ratified:\"\nnone of the selected agreements\nCities.\nThe population is mainly concentrated in the cities of Nouakchott and Nouadhibou and along the Senegal River at the southern border of the country.\nExtreme points.\nThis is a list of the extreme points of Mauritania, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At most some 50 miles long and 22 miles wide, Martinique covers an area of 425 square miles. Its coastline is so indented that no part of the island is more than seven miles from the sea. \nThe \"Island of flowers \", as Martinique is called, is a volcanic island with rather low mountains which form steep cliffs along the coasts. It can be divided into three natural zones: a mountainous region in the north, with its two highest points at Mount Pel\u00e9e (an active volcano, 4,428 ft.) and the Pitons du Carbet (3,960 ft.); the Lamentin Plain in the center; and a hilly region in the south, composed of eroded remnants of old volcanoes and dominated by the Montagne du Vauclin (1,656 ft.) and the Morne du Diamant (1,567 ft.).\nStatistics.\nArea:\n&lt;br&gt;\"total:\"\n1,100\u00a0km\u00b2\n&lt;br&gt;\"land:\"\n1,060\u00a0km\u00b2\n&lt;br&gt;\"water:\"\n40\u00a0km\u00b2\nArea \u2013 comparative:\nslightly more than twice the size of the Isle of Man, or six times the size of the City of Washington, D.C.\nLand boundaries:\n0\u00a0km\nMaritime claims:\n&lt;br&gt;\"exclusive economic zone:\"\n&lt;br&gt;\"territorial sea:\"\nNatural resources:\ncoastal scenery and beaches, cultivable land\nLand use:\n&lt;br&gt;\"arable land:\"\n8%\n&lt;br&gt;\"permanent crops:\"\n8%\n&lt;br&gt;\"permanent pastures:\"\n17%\n&lt;br&gt;\"forests and woodland:\"\n44%\n&lt;br&gt;\"other:\"\n23% (1993 est.)\nIrrigated land:\n40\u00a0km\u00b2 (1993 est.)\nNatural hazards:\nhurricanes, flooding, and volcanic activity (an average of one major natural disaster every five years)\nTerrain.\nThe mountainous, sparsely populated north, covered with dense rainsforests, contains 4 main active or extinct volcanic ranges towering around 1000 metres above sea level\u00a0\u2014 Pitons du Carbet, Morne Jacob, Mount Pel\u00e9e and Piton Conil. Black sand beaches predominate in northern Martinique due to volcanism.\nThe more populated, field-covered southern part of Martinique is occupied by lower ridges and hills, towering around 400\u2013500 metres above sea level, with a rugged coastline including numerous white sand corallian coves. The deeply populated central part of the island, home of the vast majority of the population, and formed by the lower slopes of the Pitons du Carbet massif and the Lamentin and Rivi\u00e8re Sal\u00e9e plains, covered with sugarcane and mangroves, is a transition zone between the mountainous north and the hilly south.\nMartinique is surrounded by small islets and hosts three main peninsulas, the Presqu'\u00eele de la Caravelle Peninsula in the Atlantic coast, the Trois \u00celets Peninsula in the Southwest Caribbean coast and the Saint Anne Peninsula in the Saint Lucia Channel.\nMartinique has many rivers, but owing to its size and topography, no large ones. The most important of them \u2014the Lorrain, Galion, Capote and L\u00e9zarde\u2014flow through the center of the island. The rivers in the south\u2014the Sal\u00e9e and Pilote\u2014are short and often dry, while in the north they are just torrents cut by numerous waterfalls.\nClimate.\nMartinique's tropical climate is tempered by the trade winds, and the temperature averages 26\u00a0\u00b0C (79\u00a0\u00b0F) the year round. Rainfall is abundant, although unevenly distributed throughout the year, and varies according to the altitude; the annual rainfall ranges from 3988 to 4877\u00a0mm (157\u2013192 in.) in the mountainous northern region facing the Atlantic to less than 990\u00a0mm (39 in.) in the south. Owing to this climate and the fertility of the volcanic soils, the vegetation in Martinique is luxuriant, with mangroves along the coasts and tree ferns and numerous varieties of trees in the interior.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain."}

Numerous bays along the indented coastline of the islands provide harbours. The landscape of the islands is characterised by high hills with terraced fields. The capital is Valletta.\nSurface: statistics.\nMalta has a total area of with land making up all of that and water taking up zero area. Compared to other political entities, this makes Malta, in comparison with\nExcluding from the island of Gozo, Malta has a coastline of . Its maritime claims of territorial sea are , contiguous zone is , continental shelf is depth or to the depth of exploitation, and Malta's exclusive fishing zone spans .\nGeology.\nThe geology of Malta consists of a sequence of sedimentary rocks of late Oligocene to late Miocene age cut through by a set of extensional faults of Pliocene age. The sequence is divided into five formations, from the oldest, the Lower Coralline Limestone, followed by the Globigerina Limestone, the Blue Clay and the youngest unit, the Upper Coralline Limestone.\nSeascape.\nThe seabed surrounding Malta's islands retains traces of ancient geomarine features, suggesting potential archaeological discoveries that could shed light on the region's prehistoric environment. The shelf is narrower south of the archipelago and wider on its northern side, with swaths of seagrass close to shore and maerl in the outer part of the shelf. These form belts are regulated by the availability of light and intensity of currents.\nClimate.\nMediterranean with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers.https://\nElevation extremes.\nThe lowest point is the Mediterranean Sea at 0\u00a0m (0\u00a0ft) and the highest point is Ta' Dmejrek at .\nLand use.\nIrrigated land.\n (2007)\nTotal renewable water resources.\n (2011)\nEnvironment.\nCurrent issues.\nAccording to Eurostat, in 2023, 34.7% of Maltese households reported being affected by pollution, grime, or other environmental nuisances, making Malta the nation with the highest percentage in the European Union for that year and more than double the EU average of 12.2%. The rate has been increasing steadily from 26.5% in 2017 and highlights several issues: traffic-related emissions, dust from road or building works, garbage waiting to be collected, rodent and cockroach infestations, sea slime during the summer months, noise pollution, a lack of greenery and illegal dumping.\nIn 2023, Malta recorded an annual average PM2.5 concentration of 12 micrograms per cubic metre, more than double the number of fine-particle pollutants recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The WHO guidelines are 5 micrograms per cubic meter. The World Air Quality Report 2023 by IQAir ranked Malta 49th out of 134 countries (best to worst) for PM2.5 concentration, while among European countries, Malta ranked 26th when ordered from best to worst air quality. Fine particles include contaminants like sulphates, black carbon, nitrates, and ammonium, specifically those measuring 2.5 millionths of a meter, approximately one-fiftieth the diameter of human hair. These little particles, despite their size, can significantly harm human health since they are readily absorbed into the lungs and bloodstream, resulting in conditions such as asthma, cancer, strokes, and lung disease, and have been associated with automobile use and construction, among other contributors. From 2011 to 2021, the number of residences in Malta increased from about 224,000 to over 297,000, representing a growth of roughly one-third, exceeding the population's rise. The quantity of automobiles in Malta has persistently risen, currently exceeding 420,000, with approximately 30 new vehicles being introduced daily. Official data from the National Statistics Office reveals that there are more than 18,000 automobiles per square kilometre of road and 1,500 cars for every 1,000 individuals.\nLimited natural fresh water resources; increasing reliance on desalination. A 2021 study assessed the impact of climate change on the groundwater resources of the Maltese Islands, simulating the combined effects of sea-level rise, reduced groundwater recharge, and increased water demand on Malta\u2019s mean sea-level aquifer up to the year 2100. The model was calibrated using observed hydraulic data from 1944, 1990, and 2014. The results indicated that rising water demand and decreasing recharge are the dominant drivers of groundwater decline, while sea-level rise has a relatively minor direct effect over the study period. In the worst-case scenarios, freshwater storage could fall by more than 16% by 2100. Localised overextraction, particularly in southeastern Malta, was shown to accelerate saltwater intrusion, posing a risk of contamination.\nSince 2016, the network of Mediterranean Experts on Climate and Environmental Change (MedECC) supported by the Union for the Mediterranean and Plan Bleu (UN Environment/MAP Regional Activity Centre), has been assessing the risks associated with climate and environmental changes in the Mediterranean. They indicate the average annual air temperatures have risen by around 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C compared to the preindustrial era, significantly more than the current global warming trend of +1.1\u00a0\u00b0C, with projections of 2.2\u00a0\u00b0C by 2040 and more than 3.8\u00a0\u00b0C by 2100.\nSurface seawater temperature was found to have risen by approximately 0.4\u00a0\u00b0C every decade. The forecasts for 2100 range from +1.8\u00a0\u00b0C to +3.5\u00a0\u00b0C compared to the period between 1961 and 1990. Sea levels have risen approximately 3\u00a0mm annually over recent decades, while the future global mean sea level is projected to range from 52 to 190\u00a0cm by 2100, resulting in increased coastal threats associated with rising sea levels, storm surges, and flooding. Seawater acidification, primarily caused by the sea absorbing excess carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere together with increased temperatures, adversely affects carbonate shells and skeletons. Mass mortality events among marine species are anticipated to be replaced by non-native ones, particularly those originating from the Red Sea.\nThe frequency of extreme occurrences such as heat waves, droughts, floods, and fires is anticipated to increase. Droughts may exacerbate social strife in the Mediterranean region. Scarce resources and wars can result in widespread people migrations. Heat-related illnesses and mortality will increase, particularly due to the urban heat island effect. Climate change will influence the proliferation of vector- and waterborne illnesses, while the quality of air, soil, and water will decline. Pollen allergies are expected to increase, while sanitary conditions may decline due to the ensuing societal and political circumstances.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is situated in Demerara-Mahaica, region 4, on the Atlantic Ocean coast, at the mouth of the Demerara River. It is nicknamed the \"Garden City of the Caribbean\". It is the retail, administrative, and financial services centre of the country, and the city accounts for a large portion of Guyana's GDP. The city recorded a population of 118,363 in the 2012 census.\nAll executive departments of Guyana's government are located in the city, including Parliament Building, Guyana's Legislative Building and the Court of Appeals, Guyana's highest judicial court. The State House (the official residence of the head of state), as well as the offices and residence of the head of government, are both located in the city. The Secretariat of the international organization known as the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), with 15 member-states and five associate partners, is also based in Georgetown.\nGeorgetown is also known for its British and Dutch colonial influenced architecture, including the tall painted-timber St. George's Cathedral and the iconic Stabroek Market.\nHistory.\nIn 1748, Governor Laurens Storm van 's Gravesande built a guard post at the mouth of the Demerara River. Later English planters started to build houses around the guard post creating a little village. The town was established in 1782 during a brief occupation by the French of the Dutch colony of Demerara. The original name of \"Longchamps\" was changed to Stabroek in 1784, after Nicholaas Geelvinck (1732 \u2014 1787), Lord of Stabroek, the then President of the Dutch West India Company.\nIn 1789, the population was 780 people of which 239 were whites, however the town rapidly started to grow and by 1807 had a population of around 8,500 people. American traders started to build a wharf which became known as American Stelling, and little towns started to appear around the main settlement.\nThe city's name changed again in 1812 when, under British rule, it became Georgetown, in honour of King George III. A ward of the city, one fourth of a mile broad and one mile long, retains the name Stabroek.\nGeorgetown gained official city status on 24 August 1842 during the reign of Queen Victoria.\nLuke M. Hill stated that Lacytown was named after, George Lacy, who was related to the family of General Sir George de Lacy Evans GCB, a Crimean war hero. \nIn 1945, a large fire (The Great Fire) broke out in the city, causing widespread damage.\nGeography.\nGeorgetown is located on Guyana's Atlantic coast on the east bank of Demerara River estuary. The terrain in this part of the country where the city is located is flat coastal plains. The city is surrounded by a blanket of cane fields along with marshy swamps, and savannah lands on its east and south. The elevation of the land is one metre below the high tide level. This low elevation is protected by a retaining wall known as the seawall to keep the ocean out and an innovative network of canals with kokers to drain the city of excess water.\nClimate.\nGeorgetown has a year-round hot trade-wind tropical rainforest climate (Af). Relative humidity fluctuates throughout the year with the highest occurring in May, June, August and December\u2013January; these months are usually the rainiest part of the year. Between the months of September to November relative humidity is lower ushering in the drier season.\nGeorgetown does not truly have a dry season \u2013 monthly precipitation in all 12 months is above . Because of its location Georgetown's temperatures are moderated by the North-East trade winds blowing in from the North Atlantic and so it rarely sees temperatures above 31 degrees Celsius.\nTransportation.\nAir.\nThe Cheddi Jagan International Airport (formerly Timehri Airport) acts as the major air transportation hub for the city, which is located on the right bank of the Demerara River, 41 kilometres south of Georgetown. Closer to the city is Eugene F. Correia International Airport (formerly Ogle Airport), with a terminal facility geared to handle regional, international and inter-Caricom flights, connecting CARICOM states with the CARICOM Secretariat. Helicopters also use this airport for the support of offshore oil and gas exploration activities.\nLand.\nThe country's first four-lane East Coast Highway was completed in 2005. Since then, development has occurred throughout the city, with countless new roads and avenues developed. The Heroes Highway was commissioned in 2022 and eased traffic congestion on the East Bank of Demerara. This highway will connect Mandela Avenue to the Soesdyke-Linden Highway.\nGeorgetown is served by private buses and taxis. The Demerara Harbour Bridge was the city's major crossing point into neighbouring Region 3 until the October 5, 2025 commissioning of the Bharrat Jagdeo Demerara River Bridge. \nWater.\nGeorgetown also is home to a seaport. The Demerara River is navigable by oceangoing vessels up to roughly 100\u00a0km upriver.\nDemographics.\nGeorgetown recorded a population of 118,363 in the 2012 Guyanese census, down 12 percent from the 134,497 people counted in the 2002 census. In 2002, about 70,962 (53%) listed themselves as Black/African; 31,902 (24%) as mixed; 26,542 (20%) as East Indian; 1,441 (1.1%) as Amerindian; 1,075 (0.8%) as Portuguese; 475 (0.35%) as Chinese; 2,265 (1.7%) as \"don't know/not stated\"; 196 (0.15%) as white not of Portuguese descent; 35 as \"other\".\nPoints of interest.\nGeorgetown is laid out in a north\u2013south, east\u2013west grid, interlaced with canals protected by kokers (sluices), built by the Dutch and later the British that provide drainage to a city that lies below high-tide level. A long seawall helps prevent flooding. The city has numerous boulevards and contains many wooden colonial buildings and markets.\nMost of the main buildings are centred around the western region of the town. Around the western-central area is Independence Square and Promenade Gardens, the Walter Roth Museum of Anthropology, the National Library (built by Andrew Carnegie), the Bank of Guyana, Company Path Garden, the National Museum of Guyana and State House (built 1852) where the president resides, St. George's Anglican Cathedral and the Red House.\nThe Georgetown Cenotaph, at Main and Church Streets, was built in 1923. It is the site of Remembrance Day (Remembrance Sunday) services in November each year.\nTo the south of this region is where the neo-Gothic City Hall (1889) is to be found, as well as the Victoria Law Courts (1887), the Parliament Building (1829\u20131834), the large Stabroek Market (1792) containing the prominent cast-iron clock tower that dominates the city sky line, the Roman Catholic Brickdam Cathedral, City Engineer House, the Magistrate's Court, St. Andrew's Kirk (1818) and Independence Arch.\nThe northern area of the city near the Atlantic coast contains Splashmins Fun Park, Fort William Frederick, a park and the Umana Yana, a conical thatched building built by Wai-Wai Amerindians using traditional techniques. It was built for the 1972 Non-Aligned Foreign Ministers Conference. The Umana Yana burnt down in 2010 but was rebuilt in 2016. The Georgetown Lighthouse is a famous landmark.\nThe Guyana National Park is an urban park in the city. More inland, surrounded by residential neighbourhoods are the Guyana Zoo, Botanical Gardens and Castellani House. The Botanical Garden, in addition to a variety of plants, also features a manatee pond, as well as other enclosures housing felines such as jaguars, lynxes, or bobcats. The city's suburbs are also home to the Museum of African Heritage located in Bel Air Park.\nAmong these key points of interest is Texila American University \u2013 Guyana Campus, located in Providence just outside the city. The university offers top-tier programs in medicine, public health and management attracting students from across the Caribbean and beyond.\nSports.\nGeorgetown hosted the CaribeBasket, the top international basketball tournament for countries in the Caribbean in 1981, 1988 and 1994.\nPerforming arts.\nGeorgetown's theatre scene is dominantly concentrated on the stages of the National Cultural Centre. Plays are also staged at the theatre guild of Guyana. This is the oldest theatrical performance facility in Guyana. It was opened in 1957 and restored in 2007.\nNeighbourhoods.\nCentral Georgetown.\nThe central city includes the business district as well as the seat of the national government.\nGreater Georgetown.\nNortheastern Georgetown also has many significant business headquarters, such as for University of Guyana, Guyana Sugar Corporation, and the CARICOM Secretariat. Also here are The Cyril Potter College of Education, Guyana International Conference Centre, and Eugene F. Correia International Airport.\nThis area also has a number of exclusive gated communities. Bel Air Park, Bel Air Gardens, Lamaha Gardens and Bel Air Springs are well known ultimately as high income neighbourhoods. While Meadow Brook Gardens, Subryanville and South Ruimveldt Gardens are High-Middle Income communities. \nNorth of Georgetown lies Main Street, where the head of state's official residence as well as the Ministry of Finance. East of Georgetown stretches towards the Avenue of the Republic, where Georgetown's city hall building is located, and St. George's Cathedral. Also on the east side is Brickdam, which is the single most concentrated area of executive departments and agencies. The Ministries of Health, Education, Home Affairs, Housing and Water are all located on Brickdam.\nWest of Stabroek Market is the Port of Georgetown, the largest and busiest shipping point in Guyana. Stabroek Market itself contains the Ministry of Labour as well as the Ministry of Human Services and Social Security. It is also the host facility for the equally famous Stabroek markets. Regent Street is considered Georgetown's premier shopping district and Sheriff Street is the main entertainment area containing most of the city's clubs, bars and restaurants.\nSouth Georgetown.\nThe south end incorporates communities of neighbourhoods along the eastern bank of the Demerara River such as Sophia, Roxanne Burnham Gardens, Albouystown, and Agricola. Those are well known and highly regarded poor areas of the city. Some areas such as Houston Estates, Ruimvelt and Thirst Park have retained high levels of affluence.\nCrime.\nArmed robberies occur regularly in Georgetown, especially in businesses and shopping districts. Particularly high crime areas of Georgetown include Tiger Bay, Albouystown, Sophia, and Agricola. Pickpocketing is a daily occurrence in the Stabroek Market area. \nUtilities.\nPower is supplied by the state-owned and controlled Guyana Power and Light. Water supply and sanitation in Guyana is handled by state-owned Guyana Water Incorporated.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nGeorgetown has several sister cities, including:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Mali's size is 1,240,192 square kilometers.\nDesert or semi-desert covers about 65 percent of Mali's total area (1,240,192 square kilometers). The Niger River creates a large and fertile inland delta as it arcs northeast through Mali from Guinea before turning south and eventually emptying into the Gulf of Guinea.\nThe territory encompasses three natural zones: the southern cultivated Sudanese zone, central semi-desert Sahelian zone, and northern desert Saharan zone. The terrain is primarily savanna in the south and flat to rolling plains or high plateau (200\u2013500 meters in elevation) in the north. There are rugged hills in the northeast, with elevations of up to 1,000 meters.\nThe Niger (with 1,693 kilometers in Mali) and Senegal are Mali's two largest rivers. The Niger is generally described as Mali's lifeblood, a source of food, drinking water, irrigation, and transportation.\nThe country's lowest point is on the Senegal River (23 m) and its highest point is Hombori Tondo (1155 m).\nClimate.\nMali is one of the hottest countries in the world, and has overall a hot, sunny and dry climate dominated by the subtropical ridge. The thermal equator, which matches the hottest spots year-round on the planet based on the mean daily annual temperature, crosses the country. Most of Mali receives negligible rainfall and droughts are very frequent. Late April to early October is the rainy season in the southernmost area. During this time, flooding of the Niger River is common, creating the Inner Niger Delta. The vast northern desert part of Mali has a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen \"BWh\") with long, extremely hot summers and scarce rainfall which decreases northwards. The central area has a hot semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen \"BSh\") with very high temperatures year-round, a long, intense dry season and a brief, irregular rainy season. The southern areas have a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Aw\") featuring very high temperatures year-round with a dry season and a rainy season. During the hottest season of the year, temperatures are high throughout the country. Timbuktu, Taghaza, Taoudenni, Araouane, Gao, Kidal and Tessalit are some of the hottest spots on Earth during their warmest months. Kayes, with an average high temperature of about in April is nicknamed \"the pressure cooker of Africa\" due to the extreme heat year-round. The heat is more extreme to the north in the Sahara Desert; the maximum average high temperature of the year reaches in Araouane in June and comes close to in the Taoudenni region during July. Sunshine duration is high in Mali, reaching the highest levels in the northern arid zone with about 3,600 \u2013 3,700 h a year.\nGeology.\nGeologically, Mali consists mostly of vast flatlands of granite and shale covered by sandstone and alluvial quartz. Mali extends over two main geological structures, the West African craton in the west and the Tuareg shield in the southeast, which came together at the end of the Precambrian era between 600 and 550 million years ago. The suture zone is to the west of the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains.\nThe underlying rocks of the West African craton are covered in the northwest by sediments of the Taoudeni basin, with two main outcrops of crystalline rocks in the northern Reguibat shield in Mauritania and the southern Leo shield which includes the Bougouni and Kenieba outcrops, both of which contain valuable minerals. There may also be petroleum reserves in the Taoudeni basin.\nBorders.\nMali shares a total of 7,243 kilometers (4,500 miles) of land boundaries with seven bordering states:\nNorth and northeast: Algeria- 1,376\u00a0km/855\u00a0mi\nEast: Niger- 821\u00a0km/510\u00a0mi\nSoutheast: Burkina Faso- 1,000\u00a0km/621\u00a0mi\nSouth: Ivory Coast- 532\u00a0km/330\u00a0mi\nSouthwest: Guinea- 858\u00a0km/533\u00a0mi\nWest: Senegal and Mauritania- 419\u00a0km/260\u00a0mi and 2,237\u00a0km/1,390\u00a0mi (respectively)\nNatural resources.\nMali is endowed with bauxite, copper, diamonds, gold, Granite, gypsum, iron ore, kaolin, limestone, lithium, manganese, phosphates, salt, silver, uranium, and zinc. Not all deposits are being exploited, and some may not be commercially viable. Mali also has ample hydropower.\nLand use.\n65% of Mali's land area is desert or semi-desert. According to estimates in 2011, only 5.63% of Mali's area can be classified as arable land, and 0.1% was planted to permanent crops. Mali was estimated to have 2,358 km2 of irrigated land in 2003. Mali has 100 cubic kilometers of total renewable water resources as off 2011 estimates.\nEnvironmental issues.\nMali faces numerous environmental challenges, including desertification, deforestation, soil erosion, drought, and inadequate supplies of potable water. Deforestation is an especially serious and growing problem. According to the Ministry of the\nEnvironment, Mali's population consumes 6 million tons of wood per year for timber and fuel. To meet this demand, 400,000 hectares of tree cover are lost annually, virtually ensuring destruction of the country's savanna woodlands.\nMali is a party to international treaties on Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands, and Whaling. It has signed, but not ratified the selected agreements.\nNatural hazards.\nNatural hazards in Mali include:\nExtreme points.\nThis is a list of the extreme points of Mali, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "56704", "revid": "9236845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56704", "title": "California State University", "text": "Public university system\nThe California State University (Cal State or CSU) is a public university system in California, and the largest public university system in the United States. It consists of 22 campuses and seven off-campus centers, which together enroll 461,612 students and employ 63,375 faculty and staff members.13, 26 In California, it is one of the three public higher education systems, along with the University of California and the California Community Colleges systems. The CSU system is officially incorporated as The Trustees of the California State University, and is headquartered in Long Beach, California.\nEstablished in 1960 as part of the California Master Plan for Higher Education, the CSU system has its roots in the California State Normal Schools that were chartered in 1857. It holds the distinction of being the leading producer of bachelor's degrees in the country, with over 110,000 graduates each year. Additionally, the CSU system contributes to the state's economy by sustaining more than 209,000 jobs.\nIn the 2015\u201316 academic year, CSU awarded 52% of newly issued California teaching credentials, 33% of the state's information technology bachelor's degrees, and it had more graduates in business, criminal justice, engineering, public administration, and agriculture than all other colleges and universities in California combined. Altogether, about half of the bachelor's degrees, one-fourth of the master's degrees, and 3% of the doctoral degrees awarded annually in California are from the CSU. Additionally, 62% of all bachelor's degrees granted to Hispanic students in California and over half of bachelor's degrees earned by California's Latino, African American and Native American students combined are conferred by the CSU.\nSince 1961, over four million alumni have received a degree from the CSU system. CSU offers more than 1,800 degree programs in some 240 subject areas. In fall of 2024, 11,135 (or 40%) of CSU's 27,505 faculty were tenured or on the tenure track.\nHistory.\nState Normal Schools.\nToday's California State University system is the direct descendant of the Minns Evening Normal School, founded in 1857 by George W. Minns in San Francisco. It was a normal school, an institution that educated future teachers in association with the high school system and the first of its kind in California.\nThe school was taken over by the state in 1862 and moved to San Jose and renamed the California State Normal School; it eventually evolved into San Jose State University. A southern branch of the California State Normal School was created in Los Angeles in 1882. In 1887, the California State Legislature dropped the word California from the name of the San Jose and Los Angeles schools, renaming them State Normal Schools.\nLater, other state normal schools were founded at Chico (1887) and San Diego (1897); they did not form a system in the modern sense, in that each normal school had its own board of trustees and all were governed independently from one another. By the end of the 19th century, the State Normal School in San Jose was graduating roughly 130 teachers a year and was \"one of the best known normal schools in the West.\"\nIn 1919, the State Normal School at Los Angeles became the Southern Branch of the University of California; in 1927, it became the University of California at Los Angeles.\nState Teachers Colleges.\nIn May 1921, the legislature enacted a comprehensive reform package for the state's educational system, which went into effect that July. The State Normal Schools were renamed State Teachers Colleges, their boards of trustees were dissolved, and they were brought under the supervision of the Division of Normal and Special Schools of the new California Department of Education located at the state capital in Sacramento. This meant that they were to be managed from Sacramento by the deputy director of the division, who in turn was subordinate to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction (the \"ex officio\" director of the Department of Education) and the State Board of Education. By this time it was already commonplace to refer to most of the campuses with their city names plus the word \"state\" (e.g., \"San Jose State,\" \"San Diego State,\" \"San Francisco State\").\nThe resulting administrative situation from 1921 to 1960 was quite complicated. On the one hand, the Department of Education's actual supervision of the presidents of the State Teachers Colleges was minimal, which translated into substantial autonomy when it came to day-to-day operations. According to Clark Kerr, J. Paul Leonard, the president of San Francisco State from 1945 to 1957, once boasted that \"he had the best college presidency in the United States\u2014no organized faculty, no organized student body, no organized alumni association, and...no board of trustees.\" On the other hand, the State Teachers Colleges were treated under state law as ordinary state government agencies, which meant their budgets were subject to the same stifling bureaucratic financial controls as all other state agencies (except the University of California). At least one president would depart his state college because of his express frustration over that issue: Leonard himself. (One of the lasting legacies of this era is that Cal State employees, like other state employees (but not UC or local government employees) are still paid by the state controller and receive their employment and retirement benefits from CalPERS.)\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the State Teachers Colleges started to evolve from normal \"schools\" (that is, vocational schools narrowly focused on training elementary school teachers in how to impart basic literacy to young children) into teachers \"colleges\" (that is, providing a full liberal arts education) whose graduates would be fully qualified to teach all K\u201312 grades. A leading proponent of this idea was Charles McLane, the first president of Fresno State, who was one of the earliest persons to argue that K\u201312 teachers must have a broad liberal arts education. Having already founded Fresno Junior College in 1907 (now Fresno City College), McLane arranged for Fresno State to co-locate with the junior college and to synchronize schedules so teachers-in-training could take liberal arts courses at the junior college. San Diego and San Jose followed Fresno in expanding their academic programs beyond traditional teacher training. These developments had the \"tacit approval\" of the State Board of Education and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, but had not been expressly authorized by the board and also lacked express statutory authorization from the state legislature.\nState Colleges.\nIn 1932, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching was asked by the state legislature and governor to perform a study of California higher education. The so-called \"Suzzallo Report\" (after the Foundation's president, Henry Suzzallo) sharply criticized the State Teachers Colleges for their intrusion upon UC's liberal arts prerogative and recommended their transfer to the Regents of the University of California (who would be expected to put them back in their proper place). This recommendation spectacularly backfired when the faculties and administrations of the State Teachers Colleges rallied to protect their independence from the Regents. In 1935, the State Teachers Colleges were formally upgraded by the state legislature to State Colleges and were expressly authorized to offer a full four-year liberal arts curriculum, culminating in bachelor's degrees, but they remained under the Department of Education.\nDuring World War II, a group of local Santa Barbara leaders and business promoters (with the acquiescence of college administrators) were able to convince the state legislature and governor to transfer Santa Barbara State College to the University of California in 1944. After losing a \"second\" campus to UC, the state colleges' supporters arranged for the California state constitution to be amended in 1946 to prevent it from happening again.\nThe period after World War II brought a great expansion in the number of state colleges. Additional state colleges were established in Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Long Beach from 1947 to 1949, and then seven more state colleges were authorized to be established between 1957 and 1960. Six more state colleges were founded after the enactment of the Donahoe Higher Education Act of 1960, bringing the total number to 23.\nCalifornia State Colleges.\nDuring the 1950s, the state colleges' peculiar mix of fiscal centralization and operational decentralization began to look rather incongruous in comparison to the highly centralized University of California (then on the brink of its own decentralization project) and the highly decentralized local school districts around the state which operated K\u201312 schools and junior colleges\u2014all of which enjoyed much more autonomy from the rest of the state government than the state colleges. In particular, several of the state college presidents had come to strongly dislike the State Board of Education and State Superintendent of Public Instruction Roy E. Simpson, whom the presidents felt were too deferential to the University of California. Five state college presidents led the movement in the late 1950s for more autonomy from the state government: Glenn Dumke at San Francisco State (who had succeeded Leonard in 1957), Arnold Joyal at Fresno State, John T. Wahlquist at San Jose State, Julian A. McPhee at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and Malcolm Love at San Diego State. They had three main objectives: (1) a systemwide board independent of the rest of the state government; (2) the right to award professional degrees in engineering and the doctorate in the field of education; and (3) state funding for research at the state college level.\nThe state legislature was limited to merely suggesting locations to the UC Board of Regents for the planned UC campus on the Central Coast. In contrast, because the state colleges lacked autonomy, they were vulnerable to pork barrel politics in the state legislature. As early as 1932, the Suzzallo Report had noted that \"the establishing of State teachers colleges has been partly the product of geographic-political considerations rather than of thoughtful determination of needs\". In 1959 alone, state legislators introduced separate bills to individually create nineteen state colleges. Two years earlier, one bill that had actually passed had resulted in the creation of a new state college in Turlock, a town better known for its turkeys than its aspirations towards higher education, and which made no sense except that the chair of the Senate Committee on Education happened to be from Turlock.\nIn April 1960, the California Master Plan for Higher Education and the resulting Donahoe Higher Education Act finally granted autonomy to the state colleges. The Donahoe Act merged all the state colleges into the State College System of California, severed them from the Department of Education (and also the State Board of Education and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction), and authorized the appointment of a systemwide board of trustees and a systemwide chancellor. The board was initially known as the \"Trustees of the State College System of California\"; the word \"board\" was not part of the official name. In March 1961, the state legislature renamed the system to the California State Colleges (CSC) and the board became the \"Trustees of the California State Colleges.\"\nAs enacted, the Donahoe Act provides that UC \"shall be the primary state-supported academic agency for research\" and \"has the sole authority in public higher education to award the doctoral degree in all fields of learning\". In contrast, CSU may only award the doctoral degree as part of a joint program with UC or \"independent institutions of higher education\" and is authorized to conduct research \"in support of\" its mission, which is to provide \"undergraduate and graduate instruction through the master's degree.\" This language reflects the intent of UC President Kerr and his allies to bring order to \"a state of anarchy\"\u2014in particular, the state colleges' repeated attempts (whenever they thought UC was not looking) to quietly blossom into full-fledged research universities, as was occurring elsewhere with other state colleges like Michigan State.\nKerr explained in his memoirs: \"The state did not need a higher education system where every component was intent on being another Harvard or Berkeley or Stanford.\" As he saw it, the problem with such \"academic drift\" was that state resources would be spread too thin across too many universities, all would be too busy chasing the \"holy grail of elite research status\" (in that state college faculty members would inevitably demand reduced teaching loads to make time for research) for any of them to fulfill the state colleges' traditional role of training teachers, and then \"some new colleges would have to be founded\" to take up that role. At the time, California already had too many research universities; it had only 9 percent of the American population but 15 percent of the research universities (12 out of 80). The language about joint programs and authorizing the state colleges to conduct some research was offered by Kerr at the last minute on December 18, 1959, as a \"sweetener\" to secure the consent of a then-wavering Dumke, the state colleges' representative on the Master Plan survey team.\nDumke reluctantly agreed to Kerr's terms only because he knew the alternative was worse. If the state colleges could not reach a deal with UC, the California legislature was likely to be caught up in the \"superboard\" fad then sweeping through state legislatures across the United States. A \"superboard\" was a state board of higher education with plenary authority over all public higher education in the state\u2014the number of states with superboards went from 16 in 1939 to 33 by 1969. Dumke was determined to prevent UC and the state legislature from reducing the state colleges to mere UC \"satellites\", the dark fate they had narrowly escaped in 1935. At the outset of negotiations, Wahlquist had already shot down Kerr's suggestion of the \"Santa Barbara route\", because the state colleges were well aware that Santa Barbara had languished under the Board of Regents' mismanagement for 15 years. Kerr never attempted to reformulate his proposal as a threat, but the specter of his \"unstated threat\" haunted the state colleges for the remainder of the negotiations. At least under Kerr's terms the state colleges would finally have their own systemwide board, and to Dumke, that was the most important thing. To ensure this compromise at the core of the Master Plan would stay intact through the legislative process, it was agreed that the entire package could be enacted only if the state legislature, the State Board of Education, and the UC Board of Regents all agreed with its two main components: (1) the joint doctorate and (2) the new board for the state colleges.\nMost state college presidents and approximately 95 percent of state college faculty members (at the nine campuses where polls were held) strongly disagreed with the Master Plan's express endorsement of UC's primary role with respect to research and the doctorate, but they were still subordinate to the State Board of Education. In January 1960, Louis Heilbron was elected as the new chair of the State Board of Education. A Berkeley-trained attorney, Heilbron had already revealed his loyalty to his alma mater by joking that UC's ownership of the doctorate ought to be protected from \"unreasonable search and seizure.\" He worked with Kerr to get the Master Plan's recommendations enacted in the form of the Donahoe Act, which was signed into state law on April 27, 1960.\nHeilbron went on to serve as the first chairman of the Trustees of the California State Colleges (1960\u20131963), where he had to \"rein in some of the more powerful campus presidents,\" improve the smaller and weaker campuses, and get all campuses accustomed to being managed for the first time as a system. Heilbron set the \"central theme\" of his chairmanship by saying that \"we must cultivate our own garden\" (an allusion to \"Candide\") and stop trying to covet someone else's. Under Heilbron, the board also attempted to improve the quality of state college campus architecture, \"in the hope that campuses no longer would resemble state prisons.\" (For example, at the height of the Great Depression, the state government had considered converting Cal Poly San Luis Obispo into a state prison.)\nAlthough the state colleges had reported to Sacramento since 1921, the board resolved on August 4, 1961 that the headquarters of the California State Colleges would be set up in the Los Angeles area, and in December, the newly-formed chancellor's office was moved from Sacramento to a rented office on Imperial Highway in Inglewood. This location gained the unfortunate nickname of the \"imperial headquarters\". In 1965, the chancellor's office was moved to a larger office space, again rented, on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles.\nBuell G. Gallagher was selected by the board as the first chancellor of the California State Colleges (1961\u20131962), but resigned after only nine unhappy months to return to his previous job as president of the City College of New York. Dumke succeeded him as the second chancellor of the California State Colleges (1962\u20131982). As chancellor, Dumke faithfully adhered to the system's role as prescribed by the Master Plan, despite continuing resistance and resentment from state college dissidents who thought he had been \"out-negotiated\" and bitterly criticized the Master Plan as a \"thieves' bargain\". Disappointment with the Master Plan was widespread but was especially acute at Dumke's former campus, San Francisco State. Dumke retorted that his critics' ambitions to turn the state colleges into \"baby Berkeleys\" were \"unrealistic\". Looking back, Kerr thought the state colleges had failed to appreciate the vast breadth of opportunities reserved to them by the Master Plan, as distinguished from UC's relatively narrow focus on basic research and the doctorate. In any event, \"Heilbron and Dumke got the new state college system off to an excellent start.\"\nCalifornia State University and Colleges.\nIn 1966, James R. Mills, a state assemblyman from San Diego, suggested studying the possibility of changing the name of the system to California State University. Much of the leadership on this matter emerged from the San Diego area in the following years, but several bills introduced by San Diego legislators failed to pass in the face of staunch opposition from the University of California. The final compromise was that the system would become the California State University and Colleges. Alex Sherriffs, then serving as an education advisor to Governor Reagan, later explained that he was among those who fought the name change because \"most of the campuses are not, by any definition I've ever seen, a university. A university ... includes several colleges and is heavily engaged in scholarship and research. It gives the doctoral degrees\". Governor Ronald Reagan signed Assembly Bill 123 into law on November 29, 1971 and the board was renamed the \"Trustees of the California State University and Colleges\".\nIn accordance with the new systemwide name, on May 23, 1972, the board of trustees voted to rename fourteen of the nineteen CSU campuses to \"California State University,\" followed by a comma and then their geographic designation. The five campuses exempted from renaming were the five newest state colleges created during the 1960s.\nThe new names were strongly disliked at certain campuses. For example, CSUSF drew the humorous response \"Gesundheit,\" and was frequently confused with CCSF, USF, and UCSF. Over Dumke's objections, state assemblyman Alfred E. Alquist proposed a bill that would rename the San Jose campus back to San Jose State. As passed and signed into law, the bill also renamed San Diego and San Francisco back to their old names. A few years later, the Sonoma and Humboldt campuses secured passage of similar legislation.\nIn September 1976, the chancellor's office was moved from Los Angeles to a custom-built headquarters at 400 Golden Shore on the Long Beach waterfront. This was the first time CSU had owned its own headquarters building.\nCalifornia State University.\nTwo major changes occurred in 1982. First, CSU was able to quietly obtain passage of a bill dropping the word \"colleges\" from its name. Second, W. Ann Reynolds succeeded Dumke as CSU's third chancellor, and brought a dramatically different management style to the CSU system. In many ways, Reynolds was the opposite of the \"quiet\" and \"apolitical\" Dumke. Despite the severe budget pressures brought about by the passage of Proposition 13, Reynolds was able to achieve moderate success in improving parity between CSU and UC funding. She was unsuccessful in her other long-term objective, securing for CSU the right to award doctorates independently of UC. When she asked Dumke for help, he replied that \"he had given his word in 1960 and did not believe it principled to change.\" A week later, he testified before the state legislature and did not support the independent doctorate for CSU.\nMeanwhile, various problems with the 400 Golden Shore building forced the chancellor's office to move to a new building after only 22 years. The solution was to trade spaces with the parking lot across the street to the north, a site with better soil conditions. In spring 1998, CSU moved into its current headquarters at 401 Golden Shore, then demolished the old building and turned its site into a parking lot.\nIn 1995, California Maritime Academy joined the California State University system as the twenty-second campus. In 2015 it was renamed as California State University Maritime Academy.\nIn May 2020, it was announced that all 23 institutions within the CSU system would host majority-online courses in the Fall 2020 semester as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the pandemic on education.\nNear the end of 2022, the CSU actively opposed the proposed expansion of the California Community Colleges' right to confer a limited number of four-year bachelor's degrees. The community colleges involved noted how ironic it was for CSU to be pushing back against them, in light of CSU's long-running battle with UC over the right to award the doctorate.\nIn July 2023, CSU's systemwide Title IX compliance was harshly criticized in a report prepared by the Cozen O'Connor law firm at the request of the Board of Trustees (at a cost of over $1 million) and separately in another report prepared by the California State Auditor at the request of the Legislature. The Cozen report found that CSU's legal department and Title IX coordinators were severely understaffed. Cozen reported there was a widespread perception throughout the CSU system that \"individual campus administrators act to protect the interests of the institution rather than care for the individuals who have been harmed\".\nIn January 2024, CSU faculty including professors, lecturers, counselors, librarians and coaches began a system-wide strike. The strike, which consisted of 30,000 CSU faculty members and affected all of CSU's 23 campuses, was set to be held for five days, with faculty members seeking a 12% pay increase. The strike, which ended after less than a day, resulted in a tentative agreement with two 5% pay increases (one retroactive to July 1, 2023 and one planned for July 1, 2024) as well as extended parental leave, more increases for lower-paid faculty, and more benefits. Support for the agreement among faculty has been mixed.\nIn 2025, the number of CSU campuses shrank by one, as Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo absorbed Cal State University Maritime Academy, which became an off-campus branch by the name of Cal Poly, Maritime Academy.\nToday, the campuses of the CSU system include comprehensive universities and polytechnic universities along with the only maritime academy in the western United States.\nGovernance.\nThe governance structure of the California State University is largely determined by state law. The California State University is ultimately administered by the 25-member board of trustees of the California State University. The trustees appoint the chancellor of the California State University, who is the chief executive officer of the system, and the presidents of each campus, who are the chief executive officers of their campuses.\nThe Academic Senate of the California State University, made up of elected representatives of the faculty from each campus, recommends academic policy to the board of trustees through the chancellor.\nBoard of trustees.\nThe California State University is administered by the 25-member board of trustees, composed of:\nThe board meets six times each year in the Glenn S. Dumke Auditorium at the Office of the Chancellor in Long Beach. Unlike the Regents of the University of California, the board does not regularly rotate the locations of its meetings between Northern and Southern California.\nChancellor.\nThe chancellor is the chief executive officer of the CSU, and all presidents of the campuses report directly to the chancellor.\nChancellors.\nThe following persons had served as the chancellor of the California State University system:\nStudent government.\nAll 22 campuses have student government organizations, and are all members of the California State Student Association (CSSA). California Education Code https:// allows for the creation of student body organizations at any state university for the purpose of providing essential activities closely related to, but not normally included as a part of, the regular instructional program.\nCampuses.\nThe CSU is composed of 22 campuses, of which 10 are located in Northern California and 12 in Southern California. The 22 campuses are listed here by order of the year founded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n^ Cal Maritime awards only undergraduate degrees and therefore is ranked separately from the other campuses of the California State University. It is ranked in the \"Regional Colleges\" category.\nPeripheral enterprises.\nOff-campus branches.\nA few universities have established off-campus branches to increase education accessibility. These branches differ from typical university extension courses as they offer degree programs and students enjoy the same status as other CSU students. Notably, the California State University, Channel Islands is the newest addition, having transitioned from an off-campus branch of CSU Northridge. The following is a list of schools and their off-campus branches:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLaboratories.\nResearch facilities owned and operated by units of the CSU:\nObservatories.\nEstablished in 1968, the Mount Laguna Observatory, managed by San Diego State's Department of Astronomy, is the oldest observatory in the CSU system. The CSU's other observatories include the Sonoma State Observatory, managed by Sonoma State, and the Murillo Family Observatory, the newest observatory in the CSU system and managed by California State University, San Bernardino.\nHigh-performance networking.\nThe California State University is a founding and charter member of the Corporation for Education Network Initiatives in California, a nonprofit organization that provides high-performance Internet-based networking to California's K-20 research and education community.\nResearch and academics.\nThe California State University (CSU) and most of its campuses are members of Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) and the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU).\nThe CSU is a founding and charter member of CENIC, the Corporation for Education Network Initiatives in California, the nonprofit organization which provides extremely high-performance Internet-based networking to California's K\u201320 research and education community.\nThe California State University Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB) mission is to develop a professional biotechnology workforce. CSUPERB provides grant funding, organizes an annual symposium, sponsors industry-responsive curriculum, and serves as a liaison for the CSU with government, philanthropic, educational, and biotechnology industry partners. The program involves students and faculty from Life, Physical, Computer and Clinical Science, Engineering, Agriculture, Math and Business departments at all 22 CSU campuses.\nThe Hospitality Management Education Initiative (HMEI) was formed in 2008 to address the shortage of hospitality leaders in California. HMEI is a collaboration between the 14 CSU campuses that have hospitality-related degrees and industry executives. CSU awarded 95% of hospitality bachelor's degrees in the state in 2011.\nABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) is the recognized U.S. accreditor of college and university programs in applied and natural science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology. The California State University has 18 colleges with ABET-accredited engineering programs (Pomona, San Luis Obispo, Maritime, Chico, Dominguez Hills, East Bay, Fresno, Fullerton, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Northridge, Sacramento, San Bernardino, Humboldt, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jos\u00e9).\nAdmissions.\nHistorically, the requirements for admission to the CSU have been less stringent than the UC system. However, both systems require completion of the A-G requirements in high school as part of admission. The CSU attempts to accept applicants from the top one-third of California high school graduates. In contrast, the UC attempts to accept the top one-eighth. In an effort to maintain a 60/40 ratio of upper division students to lower division students and to encourage students to attend a California community college first, both university systems give priority to California community college transfer students.\nHowever, the following CSU campuses use higher standards than the basic admission standards due to the number of qualified students who apply which makes admissions at these schools more competitive:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurthermore, five California State University campuses are fully impacted for both freshmen and transfers, meaning in addition to admission into the school, admission into all majors is also impacted for the academic 2025\u201326 program. The five campuses that are fully impacted are Fullerton, Long Beach, San Diego, San Jose, and San Luis Obispo.\nThe only CSU campuses that are not impacted at either the freshman or transfer level for any academic program are Dominguez Hills, Fresno, and Monterey Bay.\nStudent profile.\nA 2016 study by the Cal State system estimated that as many as one in ten Cal State students experience homelessness during their time in college.\nImpact.\nThe CSU confers over 110,000 degrees each year, awarding almost half of the state's bachelor's degrees and one-fourth of the state's master's degrees. The entire 22 campus system sustains over 209,000 jobs statewide, generating $1.6 billion in tax revenue. Total CSU related expenditures equate to $26.9 billion.\nThe CSU produces 62% of the bachelor's degrees awarded in agriculture, 54% in business, 44% in health and medicine, 64% in hospitality and tourism, 45% in engineering, and 44% of those in media, culture and design. The CSU is the state's largest source of educators, with more than half of the state's newly credentialed teachers coming from the CSU, expanding the state's rank of teachers by nearly 12,500 per year.\nOver the last 10 years, the CSU has significantly enhanced programs towards the underserved. 56% of bachelor's degrees granted to Latinos in the state are from the CSU, while 60% of bachelor's awarded to Filipinos were from the CSU. In the Fall of 2008, 42% of incoming students were from California Community Colleges.\nCampus naming conventions.\nThe UC system follows a consistent style in the naming of campuses, using the words \"University of California\" followed by the name of its declared home city, with a comma as the separator. Most CSU campuses follow a similar pattern, though several are named only for their home city or county, such as San Francisco State University, San Jose State University, San Diego State University, or Sonoma State University.\nThe Fresno and Sacramento campuses formally follow the standard naming pattern, but respectively market themselves as \"Fresno State\" and \"Sacramento State\", and use those terms for their athletic programs. Chico, Long Beach, and Stanislaus also formally use the standard naming pattern, but use \"\"Location\" State\" for athletics only. Northridge brands its athletic program as \"CSUN\", and uses that term alongside its formal name in marketing. CSU Bakersfield started the process of rebranding its athletic program, though not the university, as \"Bakersfield\" in 2023\u201324.\nChannel Islands, and San Marcos are the only campuses whose names do not include a comma. Some critics, including Donald Gerth (former President of Sacramento State), have claimed that the weak California State University identity has contributed to the CSU's perceived lack of prestige when compared to the University of California.\nDifferences between the CSU and UC systems.\nBoth California public university systems are publicly funded higher education institutions. Despite having far fewer students, the largest UC campus, UCLA, as a result of its research emphasis and medical center, has a budget ($7.5 billion as of 2019) roughly equal to that of the entire CSU system ($7.2 billion as of 2019). According to a 2002 study, faculty at the CSU spend about 30 hours a week teaching and advising students and about 10 hours a week on research/creative activities, while a 1984 study reports faculty at the UC spend about 26 hours a week teaching and advising students and about 23 hours a week on research/creative activities. CSU's Chancellor, Dr. Charles B. Reed, pointed out in his Pullias Lecture at the University of Southern California that California was big enough to afford two world-class systems of public higher education, one that supports research (UC) and one that supports teaching (CSU). However, student per capita spending is lower at CSU, and that, together with the lack of a research mission or independent doctoral programs under the California Master Plan, has led some in American higher education to develop the perception that the CSU system is less prestigious than the UC system. Kevin Starr, the seventh State Librarian of California, described CSU in a published history of California in the 1990s as \"in so many ways the Rodney Dangerfield of public higher education\".\nAccording to the California Master Plan for Higher Education (1960), both university systems may confer bachelors or master's degrees as well as professional certifications, however only the University of California has the authority to issue Ph.D degrees (Doctor of Philosophy) and professional degrees in the fields of law, medicine, veterinary, and dentistry. As a result of legislation introduced in 2005 and 2010 (SB 724 and AB 2382, respectively), the California State University may now offer doctoral degrees in Education and Physical Therapy. Additionally, the California State University (CSU) offers Ph.D degrees and some professional doctorates as a joint degree in combination with other institutions of higher education, including joint degrees with the University of California and accredited private universities.\nThere are 22 CSU campuses and 10 UC campuses representing approximately 437,000 and 237,000 students respectively. The cost of CSU tuition is approximately half that of UC.\nCSU and UC use the terms \"president\" and \"chancellor\" internally in opposite ways: At CSU, the campuses are headed by presidents who report to a systemwide chancellor; but at UC, they are headed by chancellors who report to a systemwide president.\nCSU has traditionally been more accommodating to older students than UC, by offering more degree programs in the evenings and, more recently, online. In addition, CSU schools, especially in more urban areas, have traditionally catered to commuters, enrolling most of their students from the surrounding area. This has changed as CSU schools increase enrollment and some of the more prestigious urban campuses attract a wider demographic.\nThe majority of CSU campuses operate on the semester system while UC campuses operate on the quarter system, with the exception of UC Berkeley, UC Merced, all UC law schools, and the UCLA medical school. As of fall 2014, CSU began converting its six remaining quarter campuses to the semester calendar. Cal State LA and Cal State Bakersfield converted in fall 2016, while Cal State East Bay and Cal Poly Pomona transitioned to semesters in fall 2018. Cal State San Bernardino made the conversion in fall 2020, while Cal Poly San Luis Obispo announced its conversion by fall 2026.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "56705", "revid": "917354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56705", "title": "Geography of the Maldives", "text": "Maldives is an island country in the Indian Ocean, South Asia, south-southwest of India. It has a total land size of which makes it the smallest country in Asia. It consists of approximately 1,190 coral islands grouped in a double chain of 26 atolls, spread over roughly 90,000 square kilometres, making this one of the most geographically dispersed countries in the world. It has the 31st largest exclusive economic zone of . Composed of live coral reefs and sand bars, the atolls are situated atop a submarine ridge, long that rises abruptly from the depths of the Indian Ocean and runs from north to south. Only near the southern end of this natural coral barricade do two open passages permit safe ship navigation from one side of the Indian Ocean to the other through the territorial waters of Maldives. For administrative purposes the Maldives government organised these atolls into twenty-one administrative divisions.\nThe largest island of Maldives is Gan, which belongs to Laamu Atoll or Hahdhummathi Maldives. In Addu Atoll the westernmost islands are connected by roads over the reef and the total length of the road is .\nPhysical geography.\nMost atolls of the Maldives consist of a large, ring-shaped coral reef supporting numerous small islands. Islands average only one to two square kilometres in area, and lie between above mean sea level. Although some of the larger atolls are approximately long from north to south, and wide from east to west, no individual island is longer than eight kilometres.\nThe Maldives has no hills, but some islands have dunes which can reach above sea level, like the NW coast of Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll) in Addu Atoll. The islands are too small to have rivers, but small lakes and marshes can be found in some of them.\nOn average, each atoll has approximately 5 to 10 inhabited islands; the uninhabited islands of each atoll number approximately 20 to 60. Some atolls, however, consist of one large, isolated island surrounded by a steep coral beach. The most notable example of this type of atoll is the large island of Fuvahmulah situated in the Equatorial Channel.\nThe tropical vegetation of Maldives differs in the inhabited and in the uninhabited islands. Inhabited islands have small groves of banana, papaya, drumstick and citrus trees by the homesteads, while breadfruit trees and coconut palms are grown in available patches of land. On the other hand, uninhabited islands have mostly different kinds of bushes (mag\u016b, boshi) and mangroves (kuredi, kand\u016b) along the waterline as well as some coconut trees.\nSome islands are marshy, while others are higher owing to sand and gravel having been piled up by wave action. Often the soil is highly alkaline, and a deficiency in nitrogen, potash, and iron severely limits agricultural potential. Ten per cent of the land, or about 26\u00a0km2, is cultivated with taro, bananas, coconuts, and other fruit. Only the lush island of Fuvammulah produces fruits such as oranges and pineapples \u2013 partly because the terrain of Fuvammulah sits higher than most other islands, leaving the groundwater less subject to seawater penetration. However, as population grows, even in this island the cultivated areas are shrinking rapidly.\nFreshwater floats in a layer known as \"Ghyben/Herzberg lens\" above the seawater that permeates the limestone and coral sands of the islands. These lenses are shrinking rapidly on Male and on many islands where there are resorts catering to foreign tourists. Mango trees already have been reported dying on Male because of salt penetration. Most residents of the atolls depend on groundwater or rainwater for drinking purposes.\nClimate.\nThe temperature of Maldives ranges between throughout the year. Although the humidity is relatively high, the constant sea breezes help to keep the air moving. Two seasons dominate Maldives' weather: the dry season associated with the winter northeast monsoon and the rainy season brought by the summer southwest monsoon. Because the Maldives is the lowest country anywhere in the world, with the highest elevation in the island nation being slightly less than 8 feet, the temperature is constantly high and rarely falls below 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F), even at night. The annual rainfall averages in the north and in the south.\nThe weather in Maldives is affected by the large landmass of South Asia to the north. The presence of this landmass causes differential heating of land and water. Scientists also cite other factors in the formation of monsoons, including the barrier of the Himalayas on the northern fringe of the South Asia and the sun's northward tilt, which shifts the jet stream north. These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over the South Asia, resulting in the southwest monsoon. The hot air that rises over the South Asia during April and May creates low-pressure areas into which the cooler, moisture-bearing winds from the Indian Ocean flow. In Maldives, the wet southwest monsoon lasts from the end of April to the end of October and brings the worst weather with strong winds and storms. In May 1991 violent monsoon winds created tidal waves that damaged thousands of houses and piers, flooded arable land with seawater, and uprooted thousands of fruit trees. The damage caused was estimated at US$30\u00a0million.\nThe shift from the moist southwest monsoon to the dry northeast monsoon over the South Asia occurs during October and November. During this period, the northeast winds contribute to the formation of the northeast monsoon, which reaches Maldives in the beginning of December and lasts until the end of March. However, the weather patterns of Maldives do not always conform to the monsoon patterns of the South Asia. Rain showers over the whole country have been known to persist for up to one week during the midst of the dry season.\nArea and boundaries.\nArea:\n&lt;br&gt;\"total:\"\n&lt;br&gt;\"land:\"\n298\u00a0km2\n&lt;br&gt;\"water:\"\n0\u00a0km2\nCoastline:\nMaritime claims:\nmeasured from claimed archipelagic baselines\n&lt;br&gt;\"territorial sea:\"\n&lt;br&gt;\"contiguous zone:\"\n&lt;br&gt;\"exclusive economic zone:\"\nElevation extremes:\n&lt;br&gt;\"lowest point:\"\nIndian Ocean 0 m\n&lt;br&gt;\"highest point:\"\nunnamed location on Vilingili Island in the Addu Atoll .

{"id": "56706", "revid": "50825926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56706", "title": "Geography of Malaysia", "text": " \nThe geography of Malaysia includes both the physical and the human geography of Malaysia, a Southeast Asian country made up of two major landmasses separated by water\u2014Peninsular Malaysia to the west and East Malaysia to the east\u2014and numerous smaller islands that surround those landmasses. Peninsular Malaysia is on the southernmost part of the Malay Peninsula, south of Thailand, north of Singapore and east of the Indonesian island of Sumatra; East Malaysia comprises most of the northern part of Borneo, and shares land borders with Brunei to the north and Indonesian Borneo to the south.\nClimate.\nLocated near the equator, Malaysia's climate is categorised as equatorial, being hot and humid throughout the year. The average rainfall is a year and the average temperature is . The climates of Peninsular Malaysia and the East Malaysia differ, as the climate on the peninsula is directly affected by wind from the mainland, as opposed to the more maritime weather of East Malaysia. Malaysia is exposed to the El Ni\u00f1o effect, which reduces rainfall in the dry season. Climate change is likely to have a significant effect on Malaysia, increasing sea levels and rainfall, increasing flooding risks and leading to large droughts.\nMalaysia faces two monsoon winds seasons, the southwest monsoon from late May to September, and the northeast monsoon from October to March. The northeast monsoon brings in more rainfall compared to the southwest monsoon, originating in China and the North Pacific. The southwest monsoon originates from the deserts of Australia. March and October form transitions between the two monsoons.\nLocal climates are affected by the presence of mountain ranges throughout Malaysia, and climate can be divided into that of the highlands, the lowlands, and coastal regions. The coasts have a sunny climate, with temperatures ranging between , and rainfall ranging from a month. The lowlands have a similar temperature, but follow a more distinctive rainfall pattern and show very high humidity levels. The highlands are cooler and wetter, and display a greater temperature variation. A large amount of cloud cover is present over the highlands, which have humidity levels that do not fall below 75%.\nThe highest temperature was recorded at Chuping, Perlis on 9 April 1998 at . The lowest temperature in Peninsula Malaysia was recorded at Cameron Highlands on 1 February 1978 at . The lowest temperature in East Malaysia was recorded on Mount Kinabalu at . The highest snowfall was recorded in a year was at Mount Kinabalu, Sabah in 1975, 1993, and 2022. The highest rainfall recorded in a day was in Kota Bharu, Kelantan on 6 January 1967. The highest rainfall recorded in a year was at Sandakan, Sabah in 2006. Meanwhile, the lowest rainfall recorded in a year was at Tawau, Sabah in 1997. The wettest place in Malaysia is Kuching, Sarawak with an average rainfall of with 279 days of rain a year. The driest place in Malaysia is in Sitiawan, Perak with average rainfall of a year.\nGeology.\nMalaysia is located on the Sunda Shelf, and is tectonically inactive. The oldest rocks in the country date from 540 million years ago, and are mostly sedimentary. The most common kind of rock is limestone that formed during the Paleozoic Era. Limestone that had accreted in East Malaysia during the Tertiary period later eroded, forming basins of sedimentary rocks that are rich in oil and natural gas. The mountain ranges in Malaysia were formed through orogenesis beginning in the Mesozoic Era.\nThe total land area of Malaysia is , the 66th largest country in the world in terms of area. It is the only country to contain land on both mainland Asia and the Malay Archipelago. Peninsular Malaysia makes up , or almost 40% of the country's land area, while East Malaysia covers , or 60%. From the total land area, or 0.37% is made up of water such as lakes, rivers, or other internal waters. Malaysia has a total coastline of , and Peninsular Malaysia has , while East Malaysia has of coastline.\nMalaysia has the 29th longest coastline in the world. The two distinct parts of Malaysia, separated from each other by the South China Sea, share a largely similar landscape in that both Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia feature coastal plains rising to hills and mountains.\nPeninsular Malaysia covers the southern half of the Malay Peninsula, and extends from north to south, and its maximum width is . It is mountainous, with more than half of it over above sea level. About half of Peninsular Malaysia is covered by granite and other igneous rocks, a third more is covered by stratified rocks older than the granite, and the remainder is covered by alluvium.\nHarbours are only available on the peninsula's western side, and the most fertile land occurs when river valleys flow out to the sea. The coastal plains bordering the Strait of Malacca are the most densely populated areas of Malaysia, and contains Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur.\nEast Malaysia, on the island of Borneo, has a coastline of . It is divided between coastal regions, hills and valleys, and a mountainous interior. There are only two major cities, Kuching and Kota Kinabalu. Much of southern Sarawak is coastal lowlands, which shifts to a series of plateaus going north, ending in the mountainous regions of Sabah.\nMountain ranges.\nThe highest mountain range in Malaysia is the Crocker Range in Sabah, which divides the state in half. This range includes Mount Kinabalu, the highest mountain in the country, as well as Mount Sinsing, the third highest in the country. Mount Kinabalu, is , and is protected as it is within Kinabalu Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and national park. Mount Kinabalu is 55% (by margin) taller than Mount Trusmadi, Malaysia's second tallest mountain.\nMountain ranges in East Malaysia tend to follow north\u2013south or northeast\u2013southwest paths, and the highest ranges form the border between Malaysia and Indonesia. The mountains contain many jagged limestone peaks. The Trus Madi Range, also in Sabah, houses Mount Trus Madi. Bombalai Hill in Sabah is the only active volcano in Malaysia.\nPeninsular Malaysia contains numerous mountain ranges running parallel from north to south along the peninsula. The main mountain range is the Titiwangsa Mountains, which divides the peninsula between its east and west coasts. It houses Mount Korbu, the second highest peak in Peninsular Malaysia. These mountains are heavily forested, and mainly composed of granite. The range is the origin of some of Peninsular Malaysia's river systems. To the east of this range is the Bintang Range. The highest peak in Peninsular Malaysia is Mount Tahan, located on the Tahan Range.\nCaves.\nNumerous caves run through the country due to the karst landscape caused by water eroding limestone. The Mulu Caves in East Malaysia are the largest caves in the world. They are located between the Penambo range and Brunei, and are a major tourist attraction. At long and high the Sarawak Chamber is the largest cave chamber in the world. Other famous caves are the Deer Cave and Lang's Cave.\nIslands.\nMalaysia contains numerous islands, the largest of which fully within Malaysia is Banggi Island in Sabah, which has an area of . It is followed by Bruit Island in Sarawak, Langkawi in Kedah, and Penang Island in Penang. The largest island shared with another country is Borneo, followed by Sebatik Island. In addition, Malaysia lies within the world's coral reef distribution. The reefs can be usually found around islands such as Sipadan Island, Swallow Reef, and Redang Island. Sipadan, an underwater mountain, is Malaysia's only oceanic island.\nCoasts.\nA recent global remote sensing analysis suggests that there were 1,713\u00a0km2 of tidal flats in Malaysia, making it the 19th ranked country in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there.\nForests.\nMalaysian forests can be categorised as tropical rainforests. Approximately 58.2% of Malaysia's land is covered by forest. A large amount of lowland forest is present below an altitude of . East Malaysia, like most of Borneo, was formerly covered by the Borneo lowland rain forests with over 2000 tree species. However, much of it has been cleared, due to the increase in logging since the 1960s and the increase of shifting cultivation. Over 80% of Sarawak's forests have been felled, and the logging throughout East Malaysia has polluted waterways, increased erosion, and damaged agriculture. Some state governments have now taken measures to halt the degradation of the rainforest.\nMalaysia's rainforests are made of a variety of types, mainly dipterocarp, swamps, and mangroves. The majority of the forest is dipterocarp forests. Dipterocarps species are centred in Malaysia. There are over of mangroves in Malaysia. Some areas are designated as forest reserves, state parks, or national parks. The management of these reserves is done by the Department of Wildlife and National Park, the Forest Department of Sarawak, the Sabah Forestry Department, the Sabah Foundation, and Sabah Parks. As of 2000, there are two World Heritage Sites under the natural category \u2013 Kinabalu Park and Gunung Mulu National Park.\nEcoregions.\nMalaysia is divided into several tropical forest ecoregions.\nPeninsular Malaysia is home to the Peninsular Malaysian rain forests, Peninsular Malaysian montane rain forests, Peninsular Malaysian peat swamp forests, and Tenasserim-South Thailand semi-evergreen rain forests.\nEastern Malaysia is home to the Borneo lowland rain forests, Borneo montane rain forests, Borneo peat swamp forests, Southwest Borneo freshwater swamp forests, and Sundaland heath forests.\nPeninsular Malaysia's west coast is home to the Myanmar Coast mangroves. The Indochina mangroves fringe Peninsular Malaysia's east coast. The Sunda Shelf mangroves line Borneo's coast.\nExtreme points.\nThe southernmost point of Malaysia is located in the district of Serian in Sarawak. Tanjung Piai on the southern tip of Johor is the southernmost point of the Malay Peninsula, and thus of the whole of continental Eurasia. The easternmost point is found on the tip of Dent Peninsula in Lahad Datu district in Sabah. The northernmost point is found on the northern tip of Banggi Island. The westernmost point is Perak Island, a sandstone rock which is part of Kedah state that rises at the center of the Strait of Malacca.\nBodies of water.\nBetween Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia is the South China Sea, the largest body of water around Malaysia. Facing the western coast of Peninsular Malaysia is the Strait of Malacca towards the south, and the Andaman Sea towards the north. The Strait of Malacca, lying between Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, is arguably the most important shipping lane in the world. These seas are marginal seas of the Indian Ocean.\nOff the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia is the South China Sea, while a small part in the north lies within the Gulf of Thailand. These form part of the marginal seas of the Pacific Ocean. The Straits of Johor off the south of Peninsular Malaysia acts as the maritime border of Malaysia and Singapore. In East Malaysia, the western coasts of Sabah and Sarawak face the South China Sea. The northeast coast of Sabah faces the Sulu Sea, while the southeast coast of Sabah faces the Celebes Sea.\nMalaysia claims 12 nm () as its territorial waters, which extend into the Coral Triangle. It also has an exclusive economic zone of based on nautical miles from its coastal baseline. Malaysia claims in the depth of the continental shelf or to the depth of exploration within the area below the South China Sea known as Sundaland. The territorial claim for the Strait of Malacca is shared between Malaysia and Indonesia in accordance to a treaty signed in 1970 known as the \"Treaty Between the Republic of Indonesia and Malaysia on Determination of boundary Lines of Territorial Waters of the two Nations at the Strait of Malacca\".\nLakes.\nThe Bera Lake in Pahang is one of the largest lakes in Malaysia, and one of the only two natural lakes in Malaysia with Chini Lake. Pedu Lake is a long lake located from the Malaysia\u2013Thailand border. Kenyir Lake is the largest artificial lake in Southeast Asia.\nRivers.\nThere are many systems of rivers found around Malaysia. The longest is the Rajang River in Sarawak with a length of . The second longest is the Kinabatangan River in Sabah with a length of . The longest river in Peninsular Malaysia is the Pahang River with a length of .\nWildlife.\nMalaysia is a megadiverse country, with a high number of species and high levels of endemism. These forests contain the Rafflesia, the world's largest flower. The clearing of the Borneo lowland rain forests has caused wildlife to retreat into the upland rain forests inland.\nNatural disasters.\nMalaysia's geographical location protects the country from most major natural disasters. It is located on a seismically stable plate that minimises direct risks of earthquakes and volcanoes, is partially protected from tsunamis by surrounding landmasses, and is a rare target for tropical cyclones. However, the country's tropical climate opens the country to the risk of flooding, landslides and prolonged droughts. Global climate change may exacerbate the situation with extreme weather events in Southeast Asia raising the economic, political and social risks for Malaysia.\nStorms and flooding.\nWith 189 water basins and an average rainfall of over 2,000\u20134,000\u00a0mm per year, Malaysia is prone to riverine, muddy floods that range from hours-long flash floods, to prolonged flooding on flat, low-lying land along major tributaries and main stems. 15 instances of major flooding in the region have occurred since 1926; notable floods include the 1971 floods in and around Kuala Lumpur that killed 32, affected 180,000 and prompted the launch of flood control projects in the city, 2006 and 2007 floods in Johor that resulted in 18 deaths and RM1.5 billion in damages in addition to the temporary displacement of 110,000 people, and major flooding centered around the Klang Valley in 2021\u20132022 that led to 54 deaths, at least RM5.3\u20136.5 billion in damages and left 125,490 displaced. Flooding has been a major concern in recent decades due to rapid development in river catchment areas that has led to increased surface and river runoffs, increased sediment buildup in rivers, and frequent erosion along river banks.\nDue to weak Coriolis forces from its close proximity to the equator, direct passages of tropical cyclones are rare for the country despite its proximity to the highly active Northwestern Pacific tropical cyclone basin. The only tropical cyclones to significantly affect Malaysia since records began were Tropical Storm Greg in 1996, Tropical Storm Vamei in 2001, and Cyclone Senyar in 2025; Vamei's passage over Sabah remains the deadliest tropical storm in the country's history, with 238 dead and 102 missing. However, tropical depressions as well as outlying storm patterns generated by passing cyclones have made landfall regularly, often leading to abnormally high rainfall and flooding, such as the tail of Typhoon Lekima striking the Malay Peninsula in August 2018, and the path of 2021's Tropical Depression 29W across central Peninsular Malaysia contributing to record precipitation and protracted flooding in the region between December 2021 and January 2022.\nSeismic activity.\nMalaysia is largely seismically stable with little modern history of volcanic activity, being situated entirely on the Sunda tectonic plate, between two major boundaries of the Australian Plate and Eurasian Plate in the west of Peninsular Malaysia, and the Philippine Sea Plate and Eurasian Plate at East Malaysia.\nPeninsular Malaysia is more accustomed to only light tremors caused by earthquakes along the Sumatran islands of Indonesia generated predominantly by the Great Sumatran fault and Sunda megathrust. However, a pair of rare earthquakes that did not originate in Sumatra were felt in much of Malaya and Singapore on 31 January 1922 and 7 February 1922. As is with Singapore, the effects of tremors are also felt more significantly on skyscrapers common in populated centres in Malaysia due to the effects of mechanical resonance. East Malaysian states, particularly Sabah, are at risk of more moderate interplate and intraplate earthquakes due to its closer proximity to active tectonic activities along the Ring of Fire, with record earthquakes in the country occurring in Sabah in 1923, 1951, 1976 and 2015 at an average of 6.0\u20136.5 Mw. The fringes of Sabah also lay host to a series of the country's only volcanoes at the Tawau volcanic field and off the state's coast. Prominently, Mount Bombalai last erupted during the Holocene epoch, while the last major eruption in present-day Malaysia occurred during the formation of a chain of volcanic islands (prominently including Pulau Tiga) off Kimanis Bay in 1897.\nInterest towards tsunami risks to Malaysia has also heighten since the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Although the western coast of Peninsular Malaysia was largely shielded by Sumatra from the full effects of waves generated by the earthquake, weaker deflected tsunami waves led to damage and casualties along the northwestern coast of Peninsular Malaysia, affecting coastal Perlis, Kedah, Penang and Perak. The disaster also highlights the risk of further tsunamis that may strike coasts in direct line of undersea faults, primarily around the South China Sea.\nNatural resources.\nMinerals and petroleum.\nMalaysia produces petroleum and is a net exporter. Malaysia also produces liquefied natural gas as well as various other related products, most of which are found off the coasts of Terengganu, Sabah, and Sarawak. Other notable natural resources includes tin, timber, copper, iron, ore, and bauxite.\nMalaysia was the largest exporter of tin until the industry-wide collapse in the 1980s. Tin deposits are found in areas in Selangor, Kinta valley in Perak, Pahang and Johor. There are significant deposit of gold in the Pahang towns of Raub and Kuala Lipis and also Kelantan's district of Gua Musang.\nCoal is mostly concentrated in the Sarawak towns of Kapit, Mukah and Silantek.\nForestry.\nTimber can be found in the vast jungles in Malaysia, especially in East Malaysia. Malaysia's total exports of timber and other timber products amounted to MYR 23.4 billion in 2007.\nLand use.\nLarge areas of land are used as palm oil plantations, rubber plantations, and paddy fields. Malaysia is the world's largest exporter of palm oil producing 15.8 million tonnes of crude palm oil in 2007. Malaysia is also one of the largest producers and exporters of rubber and other rubber products.\nAs of 2011, the percentage arable land in Malaysia is 5.44%. Croplands consists of 17.49% while other land uses consists of 77.07%. As of 2009, irrigated land covers 3,800\u00a0km2. Total renewable water resource total 580 cubic km as of 2011.\nHuman geography.\nPeninsular Malaysia is more populated than East Malaysia with 79.2% of the population living in Peninsular Malaysia. In 2002, 59% of Malaysian population lived in urban areas, while the rest live in rural areas. The largest city is Kuala Lumpur with a population of 1.89 million people in the city, and about 7 million in the metropolitan area known as Klang Valley. Other major cities include George Town, Ipoh, Johor Bahru, Kuching, and Kota Kinabalu.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPolitical geography.\nMalaysia is divided into thirteen states and three Federal Territories. Eleven states and two Federal Territories are found in Peninsular Malaysia, while two states and one Federal Territory are found in East Malaysia. The states are further divided into administrative districts. In Sabah and Sarawak, they are first divided into divisions, then further divided into districts. There are separate subdivisions for electoral districts for polling purposes.\nInternational borders between Malaysia and Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore and Brunei are defined mostly by geological features such as the Perlis River and Golok River between Malaysia and Thailand; Straits of Johor between Malaysia and Singapore; and Pagalayan Canal between Malaysia and Brunei. However, borders that extends to the seas are defined by agreements such as Straits Settlement and Johore Territorial Waters Agreement of 1927 which defines Malaysia and Singapore water borders.\nBorder disputes.\nMalaysia's land borders are well established. The border with Thailand was established in 1909 when Siam ceded Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis and Terengganu to the British. Maritime border disputes between Brunei and Malaysia and a Bruneian claim on Limbang, Sarawak were resolved in an exchange of letters between the two countries on 16 March 2009 after 20 years of negotiations.\nMalaysia and Indonesia have some overlapping maritime claims, notably in the area around Sabah. An ongoing series of meetings to resolve these claims has produced 16 border agreements (to September 2010). Malaysia and Singapore also have disputes concerning some maritime borders.\nThe Philippines has a dormant claim to the eastern part of the Malaysian state of Sabah. Malaysia is also involved in a dispute involving Vietnam, Brunei, the People's Republic of China, the Philippines, and the Republic of China (Taiwan), concerning the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is wholly within the tropics; from about 9.30\u00b0S at its northernmost point to about 17\u00b0S at the southernmost tip. The country occupies a thin strip of land between Zambia and Mozambique, extending southwards into Mozambique along the valley of the Shire River. In the north and north east it also shares a border with Tanzania. Malawi is connected by rail to the Mozambican ports of Nacala and Beira. It lies between latitudes 9\u00b0 and 18\u00b0S, and longitudes 32\u00b0 and 36\u00b0E.\nThe Great Rift Valley runs through the country from north to south. Lake Malawi lies within the rift valley, making up over three-quarters of Malawi's eastern boundary. The Shire River flows down the rift valley from the south end of the lake to join the Zambezi River farther south in Mozambique. \nPlateaus and mountains lie to the east and west of the Rift Valley. The Nyika Plateau lies west of Lake Malawi in the north of the country. The Shire Highlands lie in southern Malawi, east of the rift valley and Shire River and south of Lake Malawi. The Zomba and Mulanje mountain peaks rise from the highlands to respective heights of .\nMalawi has two sites listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Lake Malawi National Park was first listed in 1984 and the Chongoni Rock Art Area was listed in 2006. Malawi's climate is hot in the low-lying areas in the south of the country and temperate in the northern highlands.\nGeography.\nThe Great Rift Valley traverses the country from north to south. In this deep trough lies Lake Malawi (also called Lake Nyasa), the third-largest lake in Africa, comprising about 25% of Malawi's area. Lake Malawi is sometimes called the Calendar Lake as it is about long and wide. The surface of Lake Malawi is located at above sea level, with a maximum depth of , which means the lake bottom is over below sea level at some points. The Shire River flows from the south end of the lake and joins the Zambezi River south in Mozambique. \nWest of the Great Rift Valley, the land forms high plateaus, plateaus rise generally above sea level. In the north, the Nyika Uplands rise as high as . The area to the west of the lake in northern and central Malawi has been categorised by the World Wildlife Fund as part of the Central Zambezian miombo woodlands ecoregion.\nSouth of the lake lie the Shire Highlands, with an elevation of , rising to elevations of at the Zomba Plateau and Mulanje Massif respectively. The Kirk Range lies west of the Shire, and forms the border with Mozambique. In its middle stretch between Chigaru and Chikwawa, the Shire River drops almost through of gorges, rapids, and cataracts. In the extreme south, the Shire enters the Zambezi lowlands, and the elevation is only above sea level.\nMalawi has five national parks:\nClimate.\nMalawi's climate is generally tropical. The altitude moderates what would be an otherwise equatorial climate. Between November and April the temperature is warm with equatorial rains and thunderstorms, with the storms reaching their peak severity in late March. After March, the rainfall rapidly diminishes and from May to September wet mists float from the highlands into the plateaus, with almost no rainfall during these months.\nIt is hot and humid from September to April along the lake and in the lower Shire Valley, with average daytime maximum around . Lilongwe is also hot and humid during these months, albeit far less than in the south. The rest of the country is warm during those months with a maximum temperature during the day around . From June through August, the lake areas and south are comfortably warm, with daytime maxima of around , but the rest of Malawi can be chilly at night, with temperatures ranging from . High altitude areas such as Mulanje and Nyika are often cold at night (around ) during June and July.\nKaronga in the far north shows little variation in temperature with maximum daytime temperature remaining around all year round but is unusual in that April and May are the wettest times of the year due to strengthening southerly winds along the lake.\nArea.\nThe total area of the country is , but this includes of water surface, mainly composed of Lake Malawi, but there are other sizeable lakes, such as Lake Malombe, Lake Chilwa and Lake Chiuta. The land area is 94,080\u00a0km\u00b2.\nThe country is dominated by Lake Malawi, which drains into the Zambezi River through the Shire River. As a result, the whole of the country, except for one eastern district, is part of the Zambezi drainage system. Lake Chiuta and the surrounding plain is drained by the Lugenda river, which is part of the Ruvuma River drainage system. Lake Chilwa, about south of Lake Chiuta, is unusual as it has no outlet although when it overflows it flows into Lake Chiuta through a swampy plain. High rates of evaporation ensure that the lake seldom fills up \u2013 much of the lake is only 1 metre deep or less.\nEnvironment \u2013 current issues:\nDeforestation; land degradation; water pollution from agricultural runoff, sewage, industrial wastes; siltation of spawning grounds endangers fish populations\nEnvironment \u2013 international agreements:\n&lt;br&gt;\"party to:\"\nBiodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands\n&lt;br&gt;\"signed, but not ratified:\"\nLaw of the Sea\nExtreme points.\nThis is a list of the extreme points of Malawi, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Until the early 1960s musicians who played keyboards were generally classified as either pianists or organists. Since the mid-1960s, a plethora of new musical instruments with keyboards have come into common usage, such as synthesizers and digital piano, requiring a more general term for a person who plays them. In the 2010s, professional keyboardists in popular music often play a variety of different keyboard instruments, including piano, tonewheel organ, synthesizer, and clavinet. Some keyboardists may also play related instruments such as piano accordion, melodica, pedal keyboard, or keyboard-layout bass pedals.\nNotable electronic keyboardists.\nThere are many famous electronic keyboardists in metal, rock, pop and jazz music. A complete list can be found at List of keyboardists.\nThe use of electronic keyboards grew in popularity throughout the 1960s, with many bands using the Hammond organ, Mellotron, and electric pianos such as the Fender Rhodes. The Doors became the first rock group to use the Moog synthesizer on a record on 1967's \"Strange Days\". Other bands, including the Moody Blues, the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, would go on to add it to their records, both to provide sound effects and as a musical instrument in its own right. In 1966, Billy Ritchie became the first keyboard player to take a lead role in a rock band, replacing guitar, and thereby preparing the ground for others such as Ray Manzarek, Keith Emerson and Rick Wakeman.\nIn the late 1960s, French musician Jean Michel Jarre, a pioneer of modern electronic music, started to experiment with synthesizers and other electronic devices. As synthesizers became more affordable and less unwieldy, many more bands and producers began using them, eventually paving the way for bands that consisted solely of synthesizers and other electronic instruments such as drum machines by the late 1970s/early 1980s. Some of the first bands that used this set up were Kraftwerk, Suicide and the Human League. Rock groups also began using synthesizers and electronic keyboards alongside the traditional line-up of guitar, bass and drums; particularly in progressive rock groups such as Yes, Genesis, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer and Pink Floyd. Fleetwood Mac, who had originated as a blues rock band, moved towards pop and soft rock and became known for synthesizer-infused hits in the 1980s such as \"Everywhere\" and \"Little Lies\".\nKeyboardists are often hired in cover bands and tribute bands, to replicate the original keyboard parts and other instrumental parts such as strings or horn section where it would be logistically difficult or too expensive to hire people to play the actual instruments.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Guyanese of mixed heritage make up 19.9%.\nIndigenous peoples, known locally as Amerindians, make up 10.5%. The indigenous groups include the Arawaks, the Wai Wai, the Caribs, the Akawaio, the Arecuna, the Patamona, the Wapixana, the Macushi, and the Warao. The two largest groups, the Indo-Guyanese and Afro-Guyanese, have experienced some racial tension.\nMost Indo-Guyanese are descended from indentured labourers who migrated from North India, especially the Bhojpur and Awadh regions of the Hindi Belt in the present day states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. A significant minority of Indo-Guyanese are also descended from indentured migrants who came from the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Among the immigrants there were many labourers from other parts of South Asia such as Nepal, Bengal, Chota Nagpur, and Northwestern India - the modern states of Punjab, Haryana - which was at the time a part of the state of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.\nThe distribution pattern in the 2002 census was similar to those of the 1980 and 1991 censuses, but the share of the two main groups has declined. Indo-Guyanese made up 51.9% of the total population in 1980, but by 1991 this had fallen to 48.6%, and then to 43.5% in the 2002 census. Those of African descent increased slightly from 30.8% to 32.3% during the first period (1980 and 1991) before falling to 30.2% in the 2002 census. With small growth in the overall population, the decline in the shares of the two larger groups has resulted in the relative increase of shares of the multiracial and Amerindian groups. \nThe Amerindian population rose by 22,097 people between 1991 and 2002. This represents an increase of 47.3% or annual growth of 3.5%. Similarly, the multiracial population increased by 37,788 persons, representing a 43.0% increase or annual growth rate of 3.2% from the base period of 1991 census.\nThe number of Chinese is about 0.2% and the White population (mostly consisting of Portuguese) is about 0.3%.\nLanguage.\nEnglish is the official language of Guyana, which is the only South American country with English as the official language.\nGuyanese Creole (an English-based creole with African and Indian syntax) is widely spoken in Guyana.\nA number of Amerindian languages are also spoken by a minority of the population. These include Cariban languages such as Macushi, Akawaio and Wai-Wai, and Arawakan languages such as Arawak (or Lokono) and Wapishana.\nOther languages include Chinese spoken by some members of the Chinese community, Portuguese spoken by some Portuguese Guyanese, Dutch spoken by Surinamese in Guyana, and Guyanese Hindustani and Tamil spoken by a few older members of the Indian Guyanese community, as well as Sarnami Hindustani spoken by Indians from Suriname.\nSecond and third languages.\nPortuguese is increasingly widely used as a second language in Guyana, particularly in the south of the country near the Brazil border. Dutch and French are spoken by those who frequently visit neighbouring Suriname and French Guiana respectively. French is widely taught in secondary schools along with Spanish as foreign languages. Spanish is also used by a minority of the population as a second language. Spanish is spoken typically by visitors and residents from Venezuela.\nReligion.\nThe religious breakdown of Guyanese people is: Hindu 28.4%, Pentecostal 16.9%, Roman Catholic 8.1%, Muslim 7.2%, Anglican 6.9%, Seventh-day Adventist 5%, other Christian denominations 20.5%, no religion 4.3%, Rastafarian 0.5%, Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed 0.1%, other faiths 2.2%. \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "56716", "revid": "1024043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56716", "title": "Geography of Guyana", "text": "The Geography of Guyana comprises the physical characteristics of the country in Northern South America and part of Caribbean South America, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Suriname and Venezuela, with a land area of approximately 214,969 square km. The country is situated between 1 and 9 north latitude and between 56 and 62 west longitude. With a -long Atlantic coastline on the northeast, Guyana is bounded by Venezuela on the west, Brazil on the west and south, and Suriname on the east.\nGeographic regions.\nThe land comprises three main geographical zones: the coastal plain, the white sand belt and the interior highlands.\nThe coastal plain, which occupies about 5 percent of the country's area, is home to more than 90 percent of its inhabitants. The plain ranges from five to six kilometers wide and extends from the Corentyne River in the east to the Venezuelan border in the northwest.\nThe coastal plain is made up largely of alluvial mud swept out to sea by the Amazon River, carried north by ocean currents, and deposited on the Guyanese shores. A rich clay of great fertility, this mud overlays the white sands and clays formed from the erosion of the interior bedrock and carried seaward by the rivers of Guyana. Because much of the coastal plain floods at high tide, efforts to dam and drain this area have gone on since the 18th century. A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 1,178\u00a0km2 of tidal flats in Guyana, making it the 30th ranked country in terms of tidal flat area.\nGuyana has no well-defined shoreline or sandy beaches. Approaching the ocean, the land gradually loses elevation until it includes many areas of marsh and swamp. Seaward from the vegetation line is a region of mud flats, shallow brown water, and sandbars. Off New Amsterdam, these mud flats extend almost . The sandbars and shallow water are a major impediment to shipping, and incoming vessels must partially unload their cargoes offshore in order to reach the docks at Georgetown and New Amsterdam.\nA line of swamps forms a barrier between the white sandy hills of the interior and the coastal plain. These swamps, formed when water was prevented from flowing onto coastal croplands by a series of dams, serve as reservoirs during periods of drought.\nThe white sand belt lies south of the coastal zone. This area is 150 to 250 kilometers wide and consists of low sandy hills interspersed with rocky outcroppings. The white sands support a dense hardwood forest. These sands cannot support crops, and if the trees are removed erosion is rapid and severe. Most of Guyana's reserves of bauxite, gold, and diamonds are found in this region.\nThe largest of Guyana's three geographical regions is the interior highlands, a series of plateaus, flat-topped mountains, and savannahs that extend from the white sand belt to the country's southern borders. The Pacaraima Mountains dominate the western part of the interior highlands. In this region are found some of the oldest sedimentary rocks in the Western Hemisphere. Mount Roraima, on the Venezuelan border, is part of the Pakaraima range and, at 2,762 meters, is Guyana's tallest peak. Farther south lies the Kaieteur Plateau, a broad, rocky area about 600 meters in elevation; the 1,000-meter high Kanuku Mountains; and the low Acarai Mountains situated on the southern border with Brazil.\nMuch of the interior highlands consist of grassland. The largest expanse of grassland, the Rupununi Savannah, covers about 15,000 square kilometers in southern Guyana. This savannah also extends far into Venezuela and Brazil. The part in Guyana is split into northern and southern regions by the Kanuku Mountains. The sparse grasses of the savannah in general support only grazing, although Amerindian groups cultivate a few areas along the Rupununi River and in the foothills of the Kanuku Mountains.\nHydrology.\nGuyana is a water-rich country. Numerous rivers flow into the Atlantic Ocean, generally in a northward direction. A number of rivers in the western part of the country, however, flow eastward into the Essequibo River, draining the Kaieteur Plateau. The Essequibo, the country's major river, runs from the Brazilian border in the south to a wide delta west of Georgetown. The rivers of eastern Guyana cut across the coastal zone, making east\u2013west travel difficult, but they also provide limited water access to the interior.\nWaterfalls generally limit water transport to the lower reaches of each river. Some of the waterfalls are spectacular; for example, Kaieteur Falls on the Potaro River drops 226 metres. Other enormous waterfalls are King Edward VIII Falls (256 m), Kumerau Falls (190 m), Oshi Falls (160 \u2013 210 m). In the country are known to exist more than 200 rapids and more than 70 large waterfalls. Many waterfalls are little known and most are not measured yet, it is possible that there are waterfalls in excess of 300 m tall.\nDrainage throughout most of Guyana is poor and river flow sluggish because the average gradient of the main rivers is only one meter every five kilometers. Swamps and areas of periodic flooding are found in all but the mountainous regions, and all new land projects require extensive drainage networks before they are suitable for agricultural use. The average square kilometer on a sugar plantation, for example, has six kilometers of irrigation canals, eighteen kilometers of large drains, and eighteen kilometers of small drains. These canals occupy nearly one-eighth of the surface area of the average sugarcane field. Some of the larger estates have more than 550 kilometers of canals; Guyana itself has a total of more than 8,000 kilometers. Even Georgetown is below sea level and must depend on dikes for protection from the Demerara River and the Atlantic Ocean.\nClimate.\nGuyana has a tropical climate, with two wet seasons (December to early February and from late April to mid-August). Temperatures are consistent throughout the year.\nAlthough the temperature never gets dangerously high, the combination of heat and humidity can at times seem oppressive. The entire area is under the influence of the northeast trade winds, and during the midday and afternoon sea breezes bring relief to the coast. Guyana lies south of the path of Caribbean hurricanes and none is known to have hit the country.\nTemperatures in Georgetown are quite constant, with an average high of and an average low of in the hottest month (July), and an average range of in February, the coolest month. The highest temperature ever recorded in the capital was and the lowest . Humidity averages 70 percent year-round. Locations in the interior, away from the moderating influence of the ocean, experience slightly wider variations in daily temperature, and nighttime readings as low as have been recorded. Humidity in the interior is also slightly lower, averaging around 60 percent.\nRainfall is heaviest in the northwest and lightest in the southeast and interior. Annual averages on the coast near the Venezuelan border are near , farther east at New Amsterdam , and in southern Guyana's Rupununi Savannah. Areas on the northeast sides of mountains that catch the trade winds average as much as of precipitation annually. Although rain falls throughout the year, about 50 percent of the annual total arrives in the summer rainy season that extends from May to the end of July along the coast and from April through September farther inland. Coastal areas have a second rainy season from November through January. Rain generally falls in heavy afternoon showers or thunderstorms. Overcast days are rare; most days include four to eight hours of sunshine from morning through early afternoon.\nCharacteristics.\nGeographic coordinates:\nTerrain.\nMostly rolling highlands; low coastal plain; savanna in south.\nNatural resources.\nBauxite, gold, diamonds, hardwood timber, shrimp, fish.\nEnvironment - international agreements.\nParty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "56721", "revid": "34128202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56721", "title": "History of Guyana", "text": " \nThe history of Guyana begins about 35,000 years ago with the arrival of humans coming from Eurasia. These migrants became the Carib and Arawak tribes, who met Alonso de Ojeda's first expedition from Spain in 1499 at the Essequibo River. In the ensuing colonial era, Guyana's government was defined by the successive policies of the French, Dutch, and British settlers. \nDuring the colonial period, Guyana's economy was focused on plantation agriculture, which initially depended on slave labor. Guyana saw major slave rebellions in 1763 and 1823. Following the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, 800,000 enslaved Africans in the Caribbean and South Africa were freed, resulting in plantations contracting indentured workers, mainly from India. Eventually, these Indians joined forces with Afro-Guyanese to demand equal rights in government and society. After the Second World War, the British Empire pursued policy decolonization of its overseas territories, with independence granted to British Guiana on May 26, 1966. Following independence, Forbes Burnham rose to power, quickly becoming an authoritarian leader, pledging to bring socialism to Guyana. His power began to weaken following international attention brought to Guyana in wake of the Jonestown mass murder suicide in 1978.\nAfter his unexpected death in 1985, power was peacefully transferred to Desmond Hoyte, who implemented some democratic reforms, before being voted out in 1992. The People's Progressive Party (PPP/C) served as the country's ruling party from 1992 to 2015. It was unseated following the victory of David Granger's Afro-Guyanese political coalition of A Partnership for National Unity and Alliance for Change (APNU+AFC) in 2015. In 2020, the PPP/C returned as the ruling party of Guyana in a contested election.\nPre-colonial Guyana and first contacts.\nThe first people to reach Guyana made their way from Siberia, perhaps as far back as 20,000 years ago. These first inhabitants were nomads who slowly migrated south into Central and South America. At the time of Christopher Columbus's voyages, Guyana's inhabitants were divided into two groups, the Arawak along the coast and the Carib in the interior. One of the legacies of the indigenous peoples was the word Guiana, often used to describe the region encompassing modern Guyana as well as Suriname (former Dutch Guiana) and French Guiana. The word, which means \"land of waters\", is appropriate considering the area's multitude of rivers and streams.\nHistorians speculate that the Arawaks and Caribs originated in the South American hinterland and migrated northward, first to the present-day Guianas and then to the Caribbean islands. The Arawak, mainly cultivators, hunters, and fishermen, migrated to the Caribbean islands before the Carib and settled throughout the region. The tranquility of Arawak society was disrupted by the arrival of the bellicose Carib from the South American interior. The warlike behaviour of the Carib and their violent migration north made an impact. By the end of the 15th century, the Carib had displaced the Arawak throughout the islands of the Lesser Antilles. The Carib settlement of the Lesser Antilles also affected Guyana's future development. The Spanish explorers and settlers who came after Columbus found that the Arawak proved easier to conquer than the Carib, who fought hard to maintain their independence. This fierce resistance, along with a lack of gold in the Lesser Antilles, contributed to the Spanish emphasis on conquest and settlement of the Greater Antilles and the mainland. Only a weak Spanish effort was made at consolidating Spain's authority in the Lesser Antilles (with the arguable exception of Trinidad) and the Guianas. In later decades, slaving, land seizure, and disease would destroy such societies, causing those who survived to have a \"far less elaborate way of life\". Between 1400 and 1860, European slave traders would import 500,000 enslaved peoples to Guyana and Suriname, along with sugar, as part of the transatlantic slave trade.\nColonial Guyana.\nEarly colonization.\nThe Dutch were the first Europeans to settle modern-day Guyana. The Netherlands had obtained independence from Spain in the late 16th century and by the early 17th century had emerged as a major commercial power, trading with the fledgling English and French colonies in the Lesser Antilles. In 1616 the Dutch established the first European settlement in the area of Guyana, a trading post twenty-five kilometers upstream from the mouth of the Essequibo River. Other settlements followed, usually a few kilometers inland on the larger rivers. The initial purpose of the Dutch settlements was trade with the Indigenous people. The Dutch aim soon changed to the acquisition of territory as other European powers gained colonies elsewhere in the Caribbean. Although Guyana was claimed by the Spanish, who sent periodic patrols through the region, the Dutch gained control over the region early in the 17th century. Dutch sovereignty was officially recognized with the signing of the Treaty of Munster in 1648. European contact and colonization would have a \"catastrophic effect\" on indigenous communities, due to diseases, Indian slave trade, intense warfare, and forced migration.\nIn 1621 the government of the Netherlands gave the newly formed Dutch West India Company complete control over the trading post on the Essequibo. This Dutch commercial concern administered the colony, known as Essequibo, for more than 170 years. The company established a second colony, on the Berbice River southeast of Essequibo, in 1627. Although under the general jurisdiction of this private group, the settlement, named Berbice, was governed separately. Demerara, situated between Essequibo and Berbice, was settled in 1741 and emerged in 1773 as a separate colony under the direct control of the Dutch West India Company. In these colonies, enslaved Africans produced \"coffee, sugar and cotton...for the Dutch market.\"\nAlthough the Dutch colonizers initially were motivated by the prospect of trade in the Caribbean, their possessions became significant producers of crops. The growing importance of agriculture was indicated by the export of 15,000 kilograms of tobacco from Essequibo in 1623. But as the agricultural productivity of the Dutch colonies increased, a labour shortage emerged. The indigenous populations were poorly adapted for work on plantations, and many people died from diseases introduced by the Europeans. The early Dutch settlers, pushed Indians out of their homelands and those they couldn't they wipe out with a combination of strategy and \"superior military technology\". Ultimately, Dutch presence in Guyana resulted in internal rather than outward migration of Indians, in part due to pull and push of Dutch trade. Although effective jurisdiction from the Dutch \"touched relatively few Indians\", relations between the Dutch and Indigenous people were \"often punctuated by physical conflicts\". The Dutch West India Company turned to the importation of enslaved Africans, who rapidly became a key element in the colonial economy. By the 1660s, the enslaved population numbered about 2,500; the number of indigenous people was estimated at 50,000, most of whom had retreated into the vast hinterland. Although enslaved Africans were considered an essential element of the colonial economy, their working conditions were brutal. The mortality rate was high, and the dismal conditions led to more than half a dozen rebellions led by the enslaved Africans. At the end of the eighteenth century, the number of people who were enslaved within Guyana was \"roughly equal that in Suriname\" while millions were invested so that goods could be created for Dutch market \"using forced labour by African people\".\nThe most famous uprising of the enslaved Africans, the Berbice Slave Uprising, began in February 1763. On two plantations on the Canje River in Berbice, the enslaved Africans rebelled, taking control of the region. As plantation after plantation fell to the enslaved Africans, the European population fled; eventually only half of the whites who had lived in the colony remained. Led by Coffy (now the national hero of Guyana), the escaped enslaved Africans came to number about 3,000 and threatened European control over the Guianas. The rebels were defeated with the assistance of troops from neighboring European colonies like from the British, French, Sint Eustatius and overseas from the Dutch Republic. The 1763 Monument on Square of the Revolution in Georgetown, Guyana commemorates the uprising.\nTransition to British Rule.\nEager to attract more settlers, in 1746 the Dutch authorities opened the area near the Demerara River to British immigrants. British plantation owners in the Lesser Antilles had been plagued by poor soil and erosion, and many were lured to the Dutch colonies by richer soils and the promise of land ownership. The influx of British citizens was so great that by 1760 the English constituted a majority of the European population of Demerara. By 1786 the internal affairs of this Dutch colony were effectively under British control, though two-thirds of the plantation owners were still Dutch. Under the British, the colonies became a huge cotton producer. This was thanks to the groundwork laid \"during the Dutch colonial era\".\nAs economic growth accelerated in Demerara and Essequibo, strains began to appear in the relations between the planters and the Dutch West India Company. Administrative reforms during the early 1770s had greatly increased the cost of government. The company periodically sought to raise taxes to cover these expenditures and thereby provoked the resistance of the planters. In 1781 a war broke out between the Netherlands and Britain, which resulted in the British occupation of Berbice, Essequibo, and Demerara. Some months later, France, allied with the Netherlands, seized control of the colonies. The French governed for two years, during which they constructed a new town, Longchamps, at the mouth of the Demerara River. When the Dutch regained power in 1784, they moved their colonial capital to Longchamps, which they renamed Stabroek. The capital was in 1812 renamed Georgetown by the British.\nThe return of Dutch rule reignited conflict between the planters of Essequibo and Demerara and the Dutch West India Company. Disturbed by plans for an increase in the slave tax and a reduction in their representation on the colony's judicial and policy councils, the colonists petitioned the Dutch government to consider their grievances. In response, a special committee was appointed, which proceeded to draw up a report called the Concept Plan of Redress. This document called for far-reaching constitutional reforms and later became the basis of the British governmental structure. The plan proposed a decision-making body to be known as the Court of Policy. The judiciary was to consist of two courts of justice, one serving Demerara and the other Essequibo. The membership of the Court of Policy and of the courts of justice would consist of company officials and planters who owned more than twenty-five slaves. The Dutch commission that was assigned the responsibility of implementing this new system of government returned to the Netherlands with extremely unfavourable reports concerning the Dutch West India Company's administration. The company's charter, therefore, was allowed to expire in 1792 and the Concept Plan of Redress was put into effect in Demerara and Essequibo. Renamed the United Colony of Demerara and Essequibo, the area then came under the direct control of the Dutch government. Berbice maintained its status as a separate colony.\nThe catalyst for formal British takeover was the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic Wars. In 1795 the French occupied the Netherlands. The British declared war on France and in 1796 launched an expeditionary force from Barbados to occupy the Dutch colonies. The British takeover was bloodless, and the local Dutch administration of the colony was left relatively uninterrupted under the constitution provided by the Concept Plan of Redress. Like the Dutch, the British, during their occupation of Guyana, also worried about not having control over indigenous people. By means of the Treaty of Amiens, both were returned to Dutch control. Peace was short-lived, however. The war between Britain and France resumed in less than a year, and in 1803 the United Colony and Berbice were seized once more by British troops. At the London Convention of 1814, both colonies were formally ceded to Britain. In 1831, Berbice and the United Colony of Demerara and Essequibo were unified as British Guiana. The colony would remain under British control until independence in 1966.\nOrigins of the border dispute with Venezuela.\nWhen Britain gained formal control over what is now Guyana in 1814, it also became involved in one of Latin America's most persistent border disputes. At the London Convention of 1814, the Dutch surrendered the United Colony of Demerara and Essequibo and Berbice to the British, a colony which had the Essequibo river as its west border with the Spanish colony of Venezuela. Although Spain still claimed the region, the Spanish did not contest the treaty because they were preoccupied with their own colonies' struggles for independence. In 1835 the British government asked German explorer Robert Hermann Schomburgk to map British Guiana and mark its boundaries. As ordered by the British authorities, Schomburgk began British Guiana's western boundary with Venezuela at the mouth of the Orinoco River, although all the Venezuelan maps showed the Essequibo river as the east border of the country. A map of the British colony was published in 1840. Venezuela protested, claiming the entire area west of the Essequibo River. Negotiations between Britain and Venezuela over the boundary began, but the two nations could reach no compromise. In 1850 both agreed not to occupy the disputed zone.\nThe discovery of gold in the contested area in the late 1850s reignited the dispute. British settlers moved into the region and the British Guiana Mining Company was formed to mine the deposits. Over the years, Venezuela made repeated protests and proposed arbitration, but the British government was uninterested. Venezuela finally broke diplomatic relations with Britain in 1887 and appealed to the United States for help. The British at first rebuffed the United States government's suggestion of arbitration, but when President Grover Cleveland threatened to intervene according to the Monroe Doctrine, Britain agreed to let an international tribunal arbitrate the boundary in 1897.\nFor two years, the tribunal consisting of two Britons, two Americans, and a Russian studied the case in Paris (France). Their three-to-two decision, handed down in 1899, awarded 94 percent of the disputed territory to British Guiana. Venezuela received only the mouths of the Orinoco River and a short stretch of the Atlantic coastline just to the east. Although Venezuela was unhappy with the decision, a commission surveyed a new border in accordance with the award, and both sides accepted the boundary in 1905. The issue was considered settled for the next half-century.\nFrom 1990 to 2017, the United Nations Secretary-General attempted to find a solution to the border dispute, with Ban Ki-moon sharing a draft framework to end the dispute. Then, in January 2018, \nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres chose the International Court of Justice to resolve the dispute, believing that he remained committed to helping remove this dispute. Guyana then filed an application beginning \"proceedings against Venezuela\" in March 2018. This led to ongoing decisions by the International Court of Justice, aimed at ending the dispute.\nThe early British Colony and the labor problem.\nPolitical, economic, and social life in the 19th century was dominated by a European planter class. Although the smallest group in terms of numbers, members of the plantocracy had links to British commercial interests in London and often enjoyed close ties to the governor, who was appointed by the monarch. The plantocracy, including those from Scotland, also controlled exports and the working conditions of the majority of the population. The next social stratum consisted of a small number of freed slaves, many of mixed African and European heritage, in addition to some Portuguese merchants. At the lowest level of society was the majority, the African slaves who lived and worked in the countryside, where the plantations were located. Unconnected to colonial life, small groups of Amerindians lived in the hinterland. The British believed that Indigenous people in Guyana would be an important as a form of security \"in times of slave uprisings\". Under the British, the colonies even became probably the biggest cotton producers in the world, something that was only possible because of the basis that was laid during the Dutch colonial era. One scholar, Bram Hoonhout, believed that without support from Indigenous groups, there would have been many more uprisings by enslaved people.\nColonial life was changed radically by the demise of slavery. Although the international slave trade was abolished in the British Empire in 1807, slavery itself continued. In what is known as the Demerara rebellion of 1823 10\u201313,000 slaves in Demerara-Essequibo rose up against their oppressors. Although the rebellion was easily crushed, the momentum for abolition remained, and by 1838 total emancipation had been effected. The end of slavery had several ramifications. Most significantly, many former slaves rapidly departed the plantations. Some ex-slaves moved to towns and villages, feeling that field labor was degrading and inconsistent with freedom, but others pooled their resources to purchase the abandoned estates of their former masters and created village communities. Establishing small settlements provided the new Afro-Guyanese communities an opportunity to grow and sell food, an extension of a practice under which slaves had been allowed to keep the money that came from the sale of any surplus produce. The emergence of an independent-minded Afro-Guyanese peasant class, however, threatened the planters' political power, inasmuch as the planters no longer held a near-monopoly on the colony's economic activity.\nFor some plantation owners, Guyana had more \"fertile territory\" and gained more \"substantial profits\", even after abolition of slavery, than any of their plantations elsewhere, whether in Trinidad and Tobago, St. Lucia, Nevis, or Jamaica. At the time that the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 was passed, chattel slavery was ended, and the 46,000 slaveowners in Britain and its colonies were compensated for \"property\" loss. Some scholars stated that \nBritish Guinea used more fixed capital per slave than other colonies, like use of large boiling-houses and steam engines.\nEmancipation also resulted in the introduction of new ethnic and cultural groups into British Guiana. The departure of the Afro-Guyanese from the sugar plantations soon led to labour shortages. After unsuccessful attempts throughout the 19th century to attract Portuguese workers from Madeira, the estate owners were again left with an inadequate supply of labour. Portuguese Guyanese had not taken to plantation work and soon moved into other parts of the economy, especially retail business, where they became competitors with the new Afro-Guyanese middle class. Some 14,000 Chinese came to the colony between 1853 and 1912. Like their Portuguese predecessors, the Chinese Guyanese forsook the plantations for the retail trades and soon became assimilated into Guianese society.\nConcerned about the plantations' shrinking labor pool and the potential decline of the sugar sector, British authorities, like their counterparts in Dutch Guiana, began to contract for the services of poorly paid indentured workers from India. The East Indians, as this group was known locally, signed on for a certain number of years, after which, in theory, they would return to India with their savings from working in the sugar fields. The introduction of indentured East Indian workers alleviated the labor shortage and added another group to Guyana's ethnic mix. A majority of the Indo-Guyanese workers had their origins in eastern Uttar Pradesh, with a smaller amount coming from Tamil and Telugu speaking areas in southern India. A small minority of these workers came from other areas such as Bengal, Punjab, and Gujarat. The indenture service in Guyana, which began with the arrival of 396 immigrants from India known as the \"Gladstone Coolies\" in May 1838, would not end until 1917.\nPolitical and social awakenings.\nNineteenth-century British Guiana.\nThe constitution of the British colony favoured the white and South Asian planters. Planter political power was based in the Court of Policy and the two courts of justice, established in the late 18th century under Dutch rule. The Court of Policy had both legislative and administrative functions and was composed of the governor, three colonial officials, and four colonists, with the governor presiding. The courts of justice resolved judicial matters, such as licensing and civil service appointments, which were brought before them by petition. In addition, the first police force for the colony was established in July 1839.\nRaising and disbursing revenue was the responsibility of the Combined Court, which included members of the Court of Policy and six additional financial representatives appointed by the College of Electors. In 1855 the Combined Court also assumed responsibility for setting the salaries of all government officials. This duty made the Combined Court a centre of intrigues resulting in periodic clashes between the governor and the planters.\nOther Guyanese began to demand a more representative political system in the 19th century. By the late 1880s, pressure from the new Afro-Guyanese middle class was building for constitutional reform. In particular, there were calls to convert the Court of Policy into an assembly with ten elected members, to ease voter qualifications, and to abolish the College of Electors. Reforms were resisted by the planters, led by Henry K. Davson, owner of a large plantation. In London the planters had allies in the West India Committee and also in the West India Association of Glasgow, both presided over by proprietors with major interests in British Guiana. During this period, Indian migrants started to move to British Guiana and settle there.\nConstitutional revisions in 1891 incorporated some of the changes demanded by the reformers. The planters lost political influence with the abolition of the College of Electors and the relaxation of voter qualification. At the same time, the Court of Policy was enlarged to sixteen members; eight of these were to be elected members whose power would be balanced by that of eight appointed members. The Combined Court also continued, consisting, as previously, of the Court of Policy and six financial representatives who were now elected. To ensure that there would be no shift of power to elected officials, the governor remained the head of the Court of Policy; the executive duties of the Court of Policy were transferred to a new Executive Council, which the governor and planters dominated. The 1891 revisions were a great disappointment to the colony's reformers. As a result of the 1892 elections, the membership of the new Combined Court was almost identical to that of the previous one. The next three decades saw additional, although minor, political changes. In 1897 the secret ballot was introduced. A reform in 1909 expanded the limited British Guiana electorate, and for the first time, Afro-Guyanese constituted a majority of the eligible voters.\nPolitical changes were accompanied by social change and jockeying by various ethnic groups for increased power. The British and Dutch planters refused to accept the Portuguese as equals and sought to maintain their status as aliens with no rights in the colony, especially voting rights. The political tensions led the Portuguese to establish the Reform Association. After the anti-Portuguese riots of 1898, the Portuguese recognized the need to work with other disenfranchised elements of Guyanese society, in particular the Afro-Guyanese. By around the start of the 20th century, organizations including the Reform Association and the Reform Club began to demand greater participation in the colony's affairs. These organizations were largely the instruments of a small but articulate emerging middle class. Although the new middle class sympathized with the working class, the middle-class political groups were hardly representative of a national political or social movement. Indeed, working-class grievances were usually expressed in the form of riots.\nPolitical and social changes in the early twentieth century.\n1905 Ruimveldt Riots rocked British Guiana. The severity of these outbursts reflected the workers' widespread dissatisfaction with their standard of living. The uprising began in late November 1905 when the Georgetown stevedores went on strike, demanding higher wages. The strike grew confrontational, and other workers struck in sympathy, creating the country's first urban-rural worker alliance. On November 30, crowds of people took to the streets of Georgetown, and by December 1, 1905, now referred to as Black Friday, the situation had spun out of control. At the Plantation Ruimveldt, close to Georgetown, a large crowd of porters refused to disperse when ordered to do so by a police patrol and a detachment of artillery. The colonial authorities opened fire, and four workers were seriously injured.\nEven though World War I was fought far beyond the borders of British Guiana, the war altered Guyanese society. The Afro-Guyanese who joined the British military became the nucleus of an elite Afro-Guyanese community upon their return. World War I also led to the end of East Indian indentured service. British concerns over political stability in India and criticism by Indian nationalists that the program was a form of human bondage caused the British government to outlaw indentured labour in 1917.\nIn the closing years of World War I, the colony's first trade union was formed. The British Guiana Labour Union (BGLU) was established in 1917 under the leadership of H.N. Critchlow and led by Alfred A. Thorne. Formed in the face of widespread business opposition, the BGLU at first mostly represented Afro-Guyanese dockworkers. Its membership stood around 13,000 by 1920, and it was granted legal status in 1921 under the Trades Union Ordinance. Although recognition of other unions would not come until 1939, the BGLU was an indication that the working class was becoming politically aware and more concerned with its rights.\nThe second trade union, the British Guiana Workers' League, was established in 1931 by Alfred A. Thorne, who served as the League's leader for 22 years. The League sought to improve the working conditions for people of all ethnic backgrounds in the colony. Most workers were of West African, East Indian, Chinese and Portuguese descent, and had been brought to the country under a system of forced or indentured labor.\nAfter World War I, new economic interest groups began to clash with the Combined Court. The country's economy had come to depend less on sugar and more on rice and bauxite, and producers of these new commodities resented the sugar planters' continued domination of the Combined Court. Meanwhile, the planters were feeling the effects of lower sugar prices and wanted the Combined Court to provide the necessary funds for new drainage and irrigation programs.\nTo stop the bickering and resultant legislative paralysis, in 1928 the Colonial Office announced a new constitution that would make British Guiana a crown colony under the tight control of a governor appointed by the Colonial Office. The Combined Court and the Court of Policy were replaced by a Legislative Council with a majority of appointed members. To middle-class and working-class political activists, this new constitution represented a step backward and a victory for the planters. Influence over the governor, rather than the promotion of a particular public policy, became the most important issue in any political campaign.\nThe Great Depression of the 1930s brought economic hardship to all segments of Guyanese society. All of the colony's major exports\u2014sugar, rice and bauxite\u2014were affected by low prices, and unemployment soared. As in the past, the working class found itself lacking a political voice during a time of worsening economic conditions. By the mid-1930s, British Guiana and the whole British Caribbean were marked by labour unrest and violent demonstrations. In the aftermath of riots throughout the British West Indies, a royal commission under Lord Moyne was established to determine the reasons for the riots and to make recommendations.\nIn British Guiana, the Moyne Commission questioned a wide range of people, including trade unionists, Afro-Guyanese professionals, and representatives of the Indo-Guyanese community. The commission pointed out the deep division between the country's two largest ethnic groups, the Afro-Guyanese and the Indo-Guyanese. The largest group, the Indo-Guyanese, consisted primarily of rural rice producers or merchants; they had retained the country's traditional culture and did not participate in national politics. The Afro-Guyanese were largely urban workers or bauxite miners; they had adopted European culture and dominated national politics. To increase the representation of the majority of the population in British Guiana, the Moyne Commission called for increased democratization of government as well as economic and social reforms.\nThe Moyne Commission report in 1939 was a turning point for British Guiana. It urged extending the franchise to women and persons not owning land and encouraged the emerging trade union movement. However, none of the Moyne Commission's recommendations were immediately implemented because of the outbreak of World War II. The country's rice industry, which had stagnated between the two World Wars, expanded, with Guyana gaining a \"virtual monopoly of the West Indies market\" by the war's end.\nWith the fighting far away, and the country as part of the Allies due to British colonial rule, the period of World War II, in British Guiana, was marked by continuing political reform and improvements to the national infrastructure. The governor, Sir Gordon Lethem, created the country's first Ten-Year Development Plan, reduced property qualifications for office holding and voting, and made elective members a majority on the Legislative Council in 1943. Under the aegis of the Lend-Lease Act of 1941, a modern air base (now Timehri Airport) was constructed by United States troops. By the end of World War II, British Guiana's political system had been widened to encompass more elements of society and the economy's foundations had been strengthened by increased demand for bauxite.\nPre-independence government.\nDevelopment of political parties.\nAt the end of World War II, political awareness and demands for independence grew in all segments of society. The immediate postwar period witnessed the founding of Guyana's major political parties. The People's Progressive Party (PPP) was founded on January 1, 1950. Internal conflicts developed in the PPP, and in 1957 the People's National Congress (PNC) was created as a split-off. These years also saw the beginning of a long and acrimonious struggle between the country's two dominant political personalities\u2014Cheddi Jagan and Linden Forbes Burnham. The U.S. government favored Burnham over Jagan, an effort to prevent the Soviet Union from \"gaining a foothold on the South American continent\", with the country serving \"special significance\" during the Cold War.\nCheddi Jagan.\nCheddi Jagan had been born in Guyana in 1918. His parents were immigrants from India. His father was a driver, a position considered to be on the lowest rung of the middle stratum of Guyanese society. Jagan's childhood gave him a lasting insight into rural poverty. Despite their poor background, the senior Jagan sent his son to Queen's College in Georgetown. After his education there, Jagan went to the United States to study dentistry, graduating from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in 1942.\nJagan returned to British Guiana in October 1943 and was soon joined by his American wife, the former Janet Rosenberg, who was to play a significant role in her new country's political development. Although Jagan established his own dentistry clinic, he was soon enmeshed in politics. After a number of unsuccessful forays into Guyana's political life, Jagan became treasurer of the Manpower Citizens' Association (MPCA) in 1945. The MPCA represented the colony's sugar workers, many of whom were Indo-Guyanese. Jagan's tenure was brief, as he clashed repeatedly with the more moderate union leadership over policy issues. Despite his departure from the MPCA a year after joining, the position allowed Jagan to meet other union leaders in British Guiana and throughout the English-speaking Caribbean.\nLinden Forbes Sampson Burnham.\nBorn in 1923, Forbes Burnham was the sole son in a family that had three children. His father was headmaster of Kitty Methodist Primary School, which was located just outside Georgetown. As part of the colony's educated class, young Burnham was exposed to political viewpoints at an early age. He did exceedingly well in school and went to London to obtain a law degree. Although not exposed to childhood poverty as was Jagan, Burnham was acutely aware of racial discrimination.\nThe social strata of the urban Afro-Guyanese community of the 1930s and 1940s included a mulatto or \"coloured\" elite, a black professional middle class, and, at the bottom, the black working class. Unemployment in the 1930s was high. When war broke out in 1939, many Afro-Guyanese joined the military, hoping to gain new job skills and escape poverty. When they returned home from the war, however, jobs were still scarce and discrimination was still a part of life. At that time, Guyana had a low gross national product, but mineral resources such as silver, wheat, timber, peanuts, and food processing.\nFounding of the PAC and PPP.\nThe springboard for Jagan's political career was the Political Affairs Committee (PAC), formed in 1946 as a discussion group. The new organization published the \"PAC Bulletin\" to promote its Marxist ideology and ideas of liberation and decolonization. The PAC's outspoken criticism of the colony's poor living standards attracted followers as well as detractors.\nIn the November 1947 general elections, the PAC put forward several members as independent candidates. The PAC's major competitor was the newly formed British Guiana Labour Party, which, under J.B. Singh, won six of fourteen seats contested. Jagan won a seat and briefly joined the Labour Party. But he had difficulties with his new party's centre-right ideology and soon left its ranks. The Labour Party's support of the policies of the British governor and its inability to create a grass-roots base gradually stripped it of liberal supporters throughout the country. The Labour Party's lack of a clear-cut reform agenda left a vacuum, which Jagan rapidly moved to fill. Turmoil on the colony's sugar plantations gave him an opportunity to achieve national standing. After the June 16, 1948 police shootings of five Indo-Guyanese workers at Enmore, close to Georgetown, the PAC and the Guiana Industrial Workers' Union (GIWU) organized a large and peaceful demonstration, which clearly enhanced Jagan's standing with the Indo-Guyanese population.\nAfter the PAC, Jagan's next major step was the founding of the People's Progressive Party (PPP) in January 1950. Using the PAC as a foundation, Jagan created from it a new party that drew support from both the Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese communities. To increase support among the Afro-Guyanese, Forbes Burnham was brought into the party.\nThe PPP's initial leadership was multi-ethnic and left of centre, but hardly revolutionary. Jagan became the leader of the PPP's parliamentary group, and Burnham assumed the responsibilities of party chairman. Other key party members included Janet Jagan, Brindley Benn and Ashton Chase, both PAC veterans. The new party's first victory came in the 1950 municipal elections, in which Janet Jagan won a seat. Cheddi Jagan and Burnham failed to win seats, but Burnham's campaign made a favourable impression on many Afro-Guyanese citizens.\nFrom its first victory in the 1950 municipal election, the PPP gathered momentum. However, the party's often strident anticapitalist and socialist message made the British government uneasy. Colonial officials showed their displeasure with the PPP in 1952 when, on a regional tour, the Jagans were designated prohibited immigrants in Trinidad and Grenada. The previous year, Jagan wrote a letter to the Czechoslovak Communist Party, with a request for assistance from the party, and would visit Czechoslavkia in August 1951.\nA British commission in 1950 recommended universal adult suffrage and the adoption of a ministerial system for British Guiana. The commission also recommended that power be concentrated in the executive branch, that is, the office of the governor. These reforms presented British Guiana's parties with an opportunity to participate in national elections and form a government, but maintained power in the hands of the British-appointed chief executive. This arrangement rankled the PPP, which saw it as an attempt to curtail the party's political power.\nThe first PPP government.\nOnce the new constitution was adopted, elections were set for 1953. The PPP's coalition of lower-class Afro-Guyanese and rural Indo-Guyanese workers, together with elements of both ethnic groups' middle sectors, made for a formidable constituency. Conservatives branded the PPP as communist, but the party campaigned on a centre-left platform and appealed to a growing nationalism. The other major party participating in the election, the National Democratic Party (NDP), was a spin-off of the League of Coloured Peoples and was largely an Afro-Guyanese middle-class organization, sprinkled with middle-class Portuguese and Indo-Guyanese. The NDP, together with the poorly organized United Farmers and Workers Party and the United National Party, was soundly defeated by the PPP. Final results gave the PPP eighteen of twenty-four seats compared with the NDP's two seats and four seats for independents.\nThe PPP's first administration was brief. The legislature opened on May 30, 1953. Already suspicious of Jagan and the PPP's radicalism, conservative forces in the business community were further distressed by the new administration's program of expanding the role of the state in the economy and society. The PPP also sought to implement its reform program at a rapid pace, which brought the party into confrontation with the governor and with high-ranking civil servants who preferred more gradual change. The issue of civil service appointments also threatened the PPP, in this case from within. Following the 1953 victory, these appointments became an issue between the predominantly Indo-Guyanese supporters of Jagan and the largely Afro-Guyanese backers of Burnham. Burnham threatened to split the party if he were not made sole leader of the PPP. A compromise was reached by which members of what had become Burnham's faction received ministerial appointments.\nThe PPP's introduction of the Labour Relations Act provoked a confrontation with the British. This law ostensibly was aimed at reducing intraunion rivalries, but would have favoured the GIWU, which was closely aligned with the ruling party. The opposition charged that the PPP was seeking to gain control over the colony's economic and social life and was moving to stifle the opposition. The day the act was introduced to the legislature, the GIWU went on strike in support of the proposed law. The British government interpreted this intermingling of party politics and labour unionism as a direct challenge to the constitution and the authority of the governor. The day after the act was passed, on October 9, 1953, London suspended the colony's constitution. Under pretext of quelling disturbances, the British sent in troops. Subsequently, Jagan was forced to resign as Chief Minister after 133 days. Britain installed an interim government. It would remain in place until 1957.\nFollowing this action, Britain would keep Guyana under military occupation, for seven years, with restricted civil liberties, and make Jagan a political prisoner. Writing in \"The Guardian\", Gaiutra Bahadur argued that \"the overthrow of Guyana's ruling party by colonial forces fomented a racial divide that continues to blight its politics\", saying that there was a greater crackdown on the Afro-Guyanese than on the Indo-Guyanese, in a deliberate and successful attempt to divide the PPP. Then-British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said they need to do everything they could to \"break the communist teeth in British Guiana\". In 2000, American historian William Blum added that beginning in 1953, and ending in 1964, the United States and Britain made life \"extremely difficult\" for Jagan and his government, because he was building a society which showcased a \"successful...alternative...to the capital model\". Tactics used included disinformation, terrorism, legalism, and general strikes, all aimed at forcing him from office.\nThe second PPP government.\nThe 1957 elections held under a new constitution demonstrated the extent of the growing ethnic division within the Guyanese electorate. The revised constitution provided limited self-government, primarily through the Legislative Council. Of the council's twenty-four delegates, fifteen were elected, six were nominated, and the remaining three were to be ex officio members from the interim administration. The two wings of the PPP, which had split two years prior, launched vigorous campaigns, each attempting to prove that it was the legitimate heir to the original party. Despite denials of such motivation, both factions made a strong appeal to their respective ethnic constituencies.\nThe 1957 elections were convincingly won by Jagan's PPP faction. Although his group had a secure parliamentary majority, its support was drawn more and more from the Indo-Guyanese community. The faction's main planks were increasingly identified as Indo-Guyanese: more rice land, improved union representation in the sugar industry, and improved business opportunities and more government posts for Indo-Guyanese.\nJagan's veto of British Guiana's participation in the West Indies Federation, favored by the British colonial authorities, caused his party to lose significant Afro-Guyanese support. In the late 1950s, the British Caribbean colonies had been actively negotiating establishment of a West Indies Federation. The PPP had pledged to work for the eventual political union of British Guiana with the Caribbean territories. The Indo-Guyanese, who constituted a majority in Guyana, were apprehensive of becoming part of a federation in which they would be outnumbered by people of African descent.\nBurnham learned an important lesson from the 1957 elections. He could not win if supported only by the lower-class, urban Afro-Guyanese. He needed middle-class allies, especially those Afro-Guyanese who backed the moderate United Democratic Party. From 1957 onward, Burnham worked to create a balance between maintaining the backing of the more radical Afro-Guyanese lower classes and gaining the support of the more capitalist middle class. Clearly, Burnham's stated preference for socialism would not bind those two groups together against Jagan, an avowed Marxist. The answer was something more basic: race. Burnham's move toward the right was accomplished with the merger of his PPP faction and the United Democratic Party into a new organization, the People's National Congress (PNC). The political split deepened the racial division between Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese, with that racial division, in the country's politics, continuing to the present. After the split, Jagan's PPP and Burnham's PNC largely became the political expressions of the Indo-Guyanese and Afro-Guyanese aspirations respectively, and advocated for their supporter's interests.\nFollowing the 1957 elections, Jagan rapidly consolidated his hold on the Indo-Guyanese community. Though candid in expressing his admiration for Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, and, later, Fidel Castro Ruz, Jagan in power asserted that the PPP's Marxist-Leninist principles must be adapted to Guyana's own particular circumstances. Jagan advocated nationalization of foreign holdings, especially in the sugar industry. British fears of a communist takeover, however, caused the British governor to hold Jagan's more radical policy initiatives in check, while Jagan remained as Minister of Trade and Industry.\nPPP re-election and aftermath.\nThe 1961 elections were a bitter contest between the PPP, the PNC, and the United Force (UF), a conservative party representing big business, the Roman Catholic Church, and Amerindian, Chinese, and Portuguese voters. These elections were held under yet another new constitution that marked a return to the degree of self-government that existed briefly in 1953. It introduced a bicameral system boasting a wholly elected thirty-five-member Legislative Assembly and a thirteen-member Senate to be appointed by the governor. The post of prime minister was created and was to be filled by the majority party in the Legislative Assembly. With the strong support of the Indo-Guyanese population, the PPP again won by a substantial margin, gaining twenty seats in the Legislative Assembly, compared to eleven seats for the PNC and four for the UF. Jagan was named prime minister. Following this election, President John F. Kennedy would approve a covert operation to \"destroy and expose\" communists in the country. This followed previous U.S. efforts to nudge Jagan in a \"pro-American direction.\"\nJagan's administration became increasingly friendly with communist and leftist regimes; for instance, Jagan refused to observe the United States embargo on communist Cuba. After discussions between Jagan and Cuban revolutionary Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara in 1960 and 1961, Cuba offered British Guiana loans and equipment. In addition, the Jagan administration signed trade agreements with Hungary and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Beginning in 1962, the U.S. government would start covert action programs in the country. Lasting until 1968, over $2 million would be spent, according to State Department documents. President John F. Kennedy, in mid-1962, would state his objection to Jagan's government, and argue that the U.S. could not \"afford to see another Castro-type regime established in this Hemisphere.\" Even so, some, such as Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., took a more moderate view of Jagan.\nJagan would become others harbored suspicions of him. Although he would even meet with President Kennedy in October 1962, he would believe that the CIA had fomented riots earlier that year when he introduced an austerity budget which increased a tax increase which \"fell mainly on Guiana's African and mixed population\". The same year, Kennedy direct talks with Harold Macmillan, then the British Prime Minister. Other U.S. officials would meet with opposition leaders such as Forbes Burnham and Peter d'Aguiar, believing Burnham's socialism was preferable to Jagan, and the British agreed to delay the country's independence. CARICOM later stated that 1962 to 1964 was a period of \"prolonged labour and racial unrest\". In 2005, Marc J. Susser, a historian working for U.S. State Department Bureau of Public Affairs, would admit that the U.S. government aimed at preventing Jagan from becoming prime minister and supported Burnham instead.\nFrom 1961 to 1964, Jagan was confronted with a destabilization campaign conducted by the PNC and UF. In addition to domestic opponents of Jagan, an important role was played by the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD), alleged to be a CIA front organization. Various reports say that AIFLD, with a budget of US$800,000, maintained anti-Jagan labor leaders on its payroll, as well as an AIFLD-trained staff of 11 activists who were assigned to organize riots and destabilize the Jagan government. Riots and demonstrations against the PPP administration were frequent, and during disturbances in 1962 and 1963 mobs destroyed part of Georgetown, doing $40 million in damage. The U.S. funded \"splinter and opposition groups\" opposing Jagan, in part because of his \"close ties\" to Fidel Castro, with the AFL-CIO and CIA allegedly inciting \"racially charged strikes and riots\".\nTo counter the MPCA with its link to Burnham, the PPP formed the Guiana Agricultural Workers Union. This new union's political mandate was to organize the Indo-Guyanese sugarcane field-workers. The MPCA immediately responded with a one-day strike to emphasize its continued control over the sugar workers. In March 1964, when the Jagan government moved to expel Meakins from the country, U.S. consul Carlson intervened to prevent it. Earlier, he had attempted to neutralize the Guianese Trades Union Council. However, William Howard McCabe helped the strikers, while U.S. labor unions worked alongside him, as part of a covert CIA labor operation.\nBy early 1963, the diplomatic representation of the U.S. in Georgetown changed to general consulate, which included a \"CIA communications backchannel\". Through that backchannel, Burham provided assurances to the CIA about what his political program would be, resulting in the agency sending him financial assistance. He had become the \"CIA's instrument\" against Jagan. At the same time, Burham supported proportional representation, as did D'Augilar, which the government resisted, leading to more discord. Before the election in 1964 began, the British unilaterally imposed a \"proportional representation electoral format\" in Guyana. McCabe met with the unionists in the country, the CIA proposed a paper which reportedly outlined \"a project to influence that election\". In addition, the CIA would start a political party to draw off the PPP's support. Jagan retained no desire to make a coalition government with Burnham and the PPP.\nJagan's ouster and Burnham's victory.\nThe PPP government responded to the strike in March 1964 by publishing a new Labour Relations Bill almost identical to the 1953 legislation that had resulted in British intervention. Regarded as a power play for control over a key labor sector, introduction of the proposed law prompted protests and rallies throughout the capital. Riots broke out on April 5; they were followed on April 18 by a general strike. By May 9, the governor was compelled to declare a state of emergency. Nevertheless, the strike and violence continued until July 7, when the Labour Relations Bill was allowed to lapse without being enacted. To bring an end to the disorder, the government agreed to consult with union representatives before introducing similar bills. These disturbances exacerbated tension and animosity between the two major ethnic communities and made a reconciliation between Jagan and Burnham, who had different political outlooks, an impossibility.\nJagan's term had not yet ended when another round of labor unrest rocked the colony. The pro-PPP GIWU, which had become an umbrella group of all labor organizations, called on sugar workers to strike in January 1964. To dramatize their case, Jagan led a march by sugar workers from the interior to Georgetown. This demonstration ignited outbursts of violence that soon escalated beyond the control of the authorities. On May 22, the governor finally declared another state of emergency. The situation continued to worsen, and in June the governor assumed full powers, rushed in British troops to restore order, and proclaimed a moratorium on all political activity. By the end of the turmoil, 160 people were dead and more than 1,000 homes had been destroyed.\nIn an effort to quell the turmoil, the country's political parties asked the British government to modify the constitution to provide for more proportional representation. The colonial secretary proposed a fifty-three member unicameral legislature. Despite opposition from the ruling PPP, all reforms were implemented and new elections set for October 1964. As Jagan feared, the PPP lost the general elections of 1964. The politics of \"aapan jaat\", Guyanese Hindustani for \"vote for your own kind\", were becoming entrenched in Guyana. The PPP won 46 percent of the vote and twenty-four seats, which made it the largest single party but short of an overall majority. However, the PNC, which won 40 percent of the vote and twenty-two seats, and the UF, which won 11 percent of the vote and seven seats, formed a coalition. The socialist PNC and unabashedly capitalist UF had joined forces to keep the PPP out of office for another term. Jagan called the election fraudulent and refused to resign as prime minister. The constitution was amended to allow the governor to remove Jagan from office.\nBurnham became prime minister on December 14, 1964. Following this, the U.S. began a strong working relationship with the country. The U.S. later encouraged loans and economic assistance from the International Monetary Fund to limit Cuban and Soviet influence and promote the country's economic development. Following his victory, Burham would retain a \"firm grip\" on the country until his death in 1985, which involved constitutional changes, elevating the PPP, tight media control, \"state violence to suppress dissent,\" while those of Indian descent experienced systemic discrimination. The British and Americans believed he was a \"lesser evil\" as compared to Jagan, who was sidelined for \"three decades\" because he was described as a Marxist. The U.S.-British effort, which began in 1953, to force Chagan out of office had been successful. Some scholars described Burnham's victory as the beginning of a \"long, repressive era\" in the country's history.\nIndependence and the Burnham era.\nBurnham in power.\nIn the first year under Forbes Burnham, conditions in the colony began to stabilize. The new coalition administration broke diplomatic ties with Cuba and implemented policies that favoured local investors and foreign industry. This included the establishment of the Bank of Guyana in October 1965. The colony applied the renewed flow of Western aid to further development of its infrastructure. A constitutional conference was held in London; the conference set May 26, 1966 as the date for the colony's independence from the United Kingdom. The sitting of the country's first Parliament happened on May 26, 1966, when the Guyana Independence Act came into effect, and day of the country's independence. The country also joined the Commonwealth of Nations in 1966.\nThe newly independent Guyana at first sought to improve relations with its neighbours. For instance, in December 1965 the country had become a charter member of the Caribbean Free Trade Association (Carifta). Relations with Venezuela were not so placid, however. In 1962 Venezuela had announced that it was rejecting the 1899 boundary and would renew its claim to all of Guyana west of the Essequibo River. In 1966, Venezuela seized the Guyanese half of Ankoko Island, in the Cuyuni River, and two years later claimed a strip of sea along Guyana's western coast. The U.S. government would soon recognize independence of the country and establish a U.S. embassy in Georgetown. Guyana had been under British rule. Delmar R. Carlson was appointed as the first U.S. Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires ad interim to Guyana. However, a memorandum in October 1965, by chief analysts of the CIA would note the weaknesses of Burnham, the continued strength of Jagan, and argued that Burham would need \"support from East Indians to be successful\". They believed that this would result in him turning to Canada, the U.S., and United Kingdom for aid to accomplish those goals.\nThe Central Intelligence Agency later argued that following independence in 1966, the country has been \"ruled mostly by socialist-oriented governments.\" In February 1967, Guyana would begin a standby arrangement with the International Monetary Fund. Such arrangements would continue, off-and-on until 1979.\nAnother challenge to the newly independent government came at the beginning of January 1969, with the Rupununi Uprising. In the Rupununi region in southwest Guyana, along the Venezuelan border, white settlers and Amerindians rebelled against the central government. Several Guyanese policemen in the area were killed, and spokesmen for the rebels declared the area independent and asked for Venezuelan aid. Troops arrived from Georgetown within days, and the rebellion was quickly put down, with those remaining fleeing to Venezuela, which refused to provide military aid to the rebels. After the uprising, Venezuela President Rafael Caldera and Burnham were alarmed at the uprising and vowed to focus their attentions on the issue of the territorial dispute between their two countries. Their concern led to the Port of Spain Protocol in 1970. In 2019, the office of Guyanese president David Granger would describe the rebellion as consisting of \"a few related cattle-owning families...[on] huge haciendas\" rather than Indigenous people.\nThe cooperative republic.\nThe 1968 elections allowed the PNC to rule without the UF. The PNC won thirty seats, the PPP nineteen seats, and the UF four seats. However, many observers claimed the elections were marred by manipulation and coercion by the PNC. The PPP and UF were part of Guyana's political landscape but were ignored as Burnham began to convert the machinery of state into an instrument of the PNC. However, an investigation of voting lists compiled by Guyanese diplomats in Britain and America \"uncovered scores of invented names and fake addresses\", with Peter D'Aguiar, leader of The United Force, calling the election result \"a seizure of power by fraud, not an election.\"\nAfter the 1968 elections, Burnham's policies, despite a continued CIA subsidy, became more leftist as he announced he would lead Guyana to socialism. He consolidated his dominance of domestic policies through gerrymandering, manipulation of the balloting process, and politicalization of the civil service. A few Indo-Guyanese were co-opted into the PNC, but the ruling party was unquestionably the embodiment of the Afro-Guyanese political will. Although the Afro-Guyanese middle class was uneasy with Burnham's leftist leanings, the PNC remained a shield against Indo-Guyanese dominance. The support of the Afro-Guyanese community allowed the PNC to bring the economy under control and to begin organizing the country into cooperatives.\nOn February 23, 1970, Guyana declared itself a \"cooperative republic\" and cut all ties to the British monarchy. The governor general was replaced as head of state by a ceremonial president. Relations with Cuba were improved, and Guyana became a force in the Nonaligned Movement. In August 1972, Burnham hosted the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Nonaligned Countries in Georgetown. He used this opportunity to address the evils of imperialism and the need to support liberation movements in southern Africa. Burnham also let Cuban troops use Guyana as a transit point on their way to the war in Angola in the mid-1970s and established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in June 1972. Others argued that he became a \"dictatorial figure\" and that, by this point, he had \"adopted the very politics the United States had sought to fend off.\"\nIn the early 1970s, electoral fraud became blatant in Guyana. PNC victories always included overseas voters, who consistently and overwhelmingly voted for the ruling party. The police and military intimidated the Indo-Guyanese. The army was accused of tampering with ballot boxes. Some scholars have noted that opposition, at the time, to the Guyanese government was multiracial. Also, it was said that in 1973, the overseas vote was \"padded\" while real people were disenfranchised, even recognized by U.S. Embassy officials.\nConsidered a low point in the democratic process, the 1973 elections were followed by an amendment to the constitution that abolished legal appeals to the Privy Council in London. After consolidating power on the legal and electoral fronts, Burnham turned to mobilizing the masses for what was to be Guyana's cultural revolution. A program of national service was introduced that placed an emphasis on self-reliance, loosely defined as Guyana's population feeding, clothing, and housing itself without outside help. The country also joined CARICOM in August 1973.\nGovernment authoritarianism increased in 1974 when Burnham issued the Declaration of Sophia where he stated that \"the Party should assume unapologetically its paramountcy over the Government which is merely one of its executive arms.\" All organs of the state would be considered agencies of the ruling PNC and subject to its control. The state and the PNC became interchangeable; PNC objectives were now public policy. The Declaration also called for a transition to a socialist state, and a nationalisation of its economy. However, despite this \"nationalistic, leftist-oriented economic policy\", which included the bauxitemining industry being nationalized, the U.S. remained a backer of the government.\nBurnham's consolidation of power in Guyana was not total; opposition groups were tolerated within limits. For instance, in 1973 the Working People's Alliance (WPA) was founded. Opposed to Burnham's authoritarianism, the WPA was a multi-ethnic combination of politicians and intellectuals that advocated racial harmony, free elections, and democratic socialism. Although the WPA did not become an official political party until 1979, it evolved as an alternative to Burnham's PNC and Jagan's PPP.\nJagan's political career continued to decline in the 1970s. Outmaneuvered on the parliamentary front, the PPP leader tried another tactic. In April 1975, the PPP ended its boycott of parliament with Jagan stating that the PPP's policy would change from noncooperation and civil resistance to critical support of the Burnham regime. Soon after, Jagan appeared on the same platform with Prime Minister Burnham at the celebration of ten years of Guyanese independence, on May 26, 1976. The following year, workers in the Guyanese sugar industry would strike \"135 days for economic justice\", ending their action on January 5, 1978. Despite Jagan's conciliatory move, Burnham had no intention of sharing powers and continued to secure his position.\nThe PNC postponed the 1978 elections, opting instead for a referendum to be held in July 1978. proposing to keep the incumbent assembly in power. The July 1978 national referendum was poorly received. Although the PNC government proudly proclaimed that 71 percent of eligible voters participated and that 97 percent approved the referendum, other estimates put turnout at 10 to 14 percent. The low turnout was caused in large part by a boycott led by the PPP, WPA, and other opposition forces. Later, then-Grenadian Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, in a speech to his supporters, would argue that U.S. efforts in Guyana, in the 1970s, were a form of \"destabilization\".\nJonestown and the 1978 massacre.\nBurnham's control over Guyana began to weaken when the Jonestown massacre brought unwanted international attention. In the late 1970s, Jim Jones, leader of the People's Temple of Christ, moved more than 1,000 of his followers from San Francisco to form Jonestown. It was a utopian agricultural community near Port Kaituma in western Guyana. The People's Temple of Christ was regarded by members of the Guyanese government as a model agricultural community that shared its vision of settling the hinterland and its view of cooperative socialism. The fact that the People's Temple was well equipped with openly flaunted weapons hinted that the community had the approval of members of the PNC's inner circle.\nComplaints of abuse by leaders of the cult prompted United States congressman Leo Ryan to fly to Guyana to investigate the matter. The San Francisco-area representative was shot and killed by members of the People's Temple as he was boarding an airplane in Port Kaituma to return to Georgetown. Fearing further publicity, Jones and more than 900 of his followers died in a massive communal murder and suicide.\nThe November 1978 Jonestown massacre suddenly put the Burnham government under intense foreign scrutiny, especially from the United States. Investigations into the massacre led to allegations that the Guyanese government had links to the People's Temple. Originally, the U.S. government wanted to bury the bodies from the massacre in a mass grave, but the Guyanese government insisted they be removed, with Jonestown Memorial Fund member Rebecca Moore arguing it was \"an American problem dumped in their laps\".\nBurnham's last years.\nAlthough the bloody memory of Jonestown faded, Guyanese politics experienced a violent year in 1979. Some of this violence was directed against the WPA, which had emerged as a vocal critic of the state and of Burnham in particular. One of the party's leaders, Walter Rodney, and several professors at the University of Guyana were arrested on arson charges. The professors were soon released, and Rodney was granted bail. WPA leaders then organized the alliance into Guyana's most vocal opposition party. The events in Jonestown were also said to increase opposition to the government, with the \"authoritarian nature\" of the government said to cause \"loss of both foreign and domestic supporters.\" Even so, the Guyanese government would begin an extended fund faculty with the International Monetary Fund, which would continue until July 1980. That aid would then be replaced by a similar financial instrument, which lasted to July 1982.\nAs 1979 wore on, the level of violence continued to escalate. In October Minister of Education Vincent Teekah was mysteriously shot to death. The following year, Rodney was killed by a car bomb. The PNC government quickly accused Rodney of being a terrorist who had died at the hands of his own bomb and charged his brother Donald with being an accomplice. Later investigation implicated the Guyanese government, however. Rodney was a well-known leftist, and the circumstances of his death damaged Burnham's image with many leaders and intellectuals in less-developed countries who earlier had been willing to overlook the authoritarian nature of his government. Although Burham's government was backed by the United States, privately, diplomats were skeptical, and believed that the Guyanese authorities had \"covered up evidence\" in Rodney's assassination. Even so, the United States continued to support the country's economy as part of U.S. \"Cold War policy in the Caribbean and Central and South America.\" A commission on his death was later convened by the PPP government in 2014.\nA new constitution was promulgated in 1980. The old ceremonial post of president was abolished, and the head of government became the executive president, chosen, as the former position of prime minister had been, by the majority party in the National Assembly. Burnham automatically became Guyana's first executive president and promised elections later in the year. In elections held on December 15, 1980, the PNC claimed 77 percent of the vote and forty-one seats of the popularly elected seats, plus the ten chosen by the regional councils. The PPP and UF won ten and two seats, respectively. The WPA refused to participate in an electoral contest it regarded as fraudulent. Opposition claims of electoral fraud were upheld by a team of international observers headed by Britain's Lord Avebury.\nThe economic crisis facing Guyana in the early 1980s deepened considerably, accompanied by the rapid deterioration of public services, infrastructure, and overall quality of life. The country became \"one of the poorest\" in the region. Blackouts occurred almost daily, and water services were increasingly unsatisfactory. The litany of Guyana's decline included shortages of rice and sugar (both produced in the country), cooking oil, and kerosene. While the formal economy sank, the black market economy in Guyana thrived. Richard Dwyer, deputy chief of mission in Guyana described the country as \"riddled by corruption\" and said the Burnham government had politics which had become \"increasingly unsavory.\" Later, George B. Roberts Jr., then the U.S. ambassador to Guyana, found Burham distasteful, but called Cheddi Jagan \"still unacceptable\" to the U.S.\nIn the 1980s, the \"largely untouched forests\" of Guyana were logged after the Burnham government implemented a structural adjustment programme following an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. In later years, the country would parcel out the country's rivers and forests to Brazilian and Asian logging and mining companies. Guyana historically has had environmental issues relating to tropical forests and forests under medium-to-high threat from deforestation.\nIn 1983, Burnham urged Ronald Reagan to limit operations in Grenada to evacuation of American civilians, rather than a full-scale invasion. In the midst of this turbulent period, Burnham underwent surgery for a throat ailment. On August 6, 1985, while in the care of Cuban doctors, Guyana's first and only leader since independence unexpectedly died of heart failure. In 2020, National Security Archive experts John Prados and Arturo Jimenez-Bacardi argued that Burnham, who had been put in place thanks to a CIA covert operation, was \"corrupt, arbitrary, and self-dealing\".\nHoyte to present.\nHoyte and economic liberalization.\nDespite concerns that the country was about to fall into a period of political instability, the transfer of power went smoothly. Vice President Desmond Hoyte became the new executive president and leader of the PNC. His initial tasks were threefold: to secure authority within the PNC and national government, to take the PNC through the December 1985 elections, and to revitalize the stagnant economy. The State Department would later stated that the Guyanese government sought to improve diplomatic relations with the U.S., coupled with a shift \"toward political nonalignment\" and away from \"state socialism and one-party control\" to expanded freedom of assembly and press and a market economy. In 1986, his government would submit a letter of intent to the IMF and World Bank, indicating commitment and willingness to economic policy reform.\nHoyte's first two goals were easily accomplished. The new leader took advantage of factionalism within the PNC to quietly consolidate his authority. The December 1985 elections gave the PNC 79 percent of the vote and forty-two of the fifty-three directly elected seats. Eight of the remaining eleven seats went to the PPP, two went to the UF, and one to the WPA. Charging fraud, the opposition boycotted the December 1986 municipal elections. With no opponents, the PNC won all ninety-one seats in local government.\nRevitalizing the economy proved more difficult. As a first step, Hoyte gradually moved to embrace the private sector, which would manifest in \"significant privatization\" in many economic sectors by the 1990s. Hoyte's administration lifted all curbs on foreign activity and ownership in 1988. Although the Hoyte government did not completely abandon the authoritarianism of the Burnham regime, it did make certain political reforms. Hoyte abolished overseas voting and the provisions for widespread proxy and postal voting. Independent newspapers were given greater freedom, and political harassment abated considerably. A law passed in 1991, later amended in 1995, allowing individuals to \"establish business enterprises\", and dispose, or acquire or interest. The Hayte government would also renew aid arrangements with the IMF. From July 1990 to December 1991, the country would have a Standby Arrangement with the IMF, in conjunction with an Extended Credit Facility which lasted until December 1993. As one scholar, noting Canadian involvement in the country's economy, put it, \"to say that structural adjustment was harsh would be an understatement\".\nJagan's years in power.\nFormer U.S. President Jimmy Carter visited Guyana to lobby for the resumption of free elections. On October 5, 1992, a new National Assembly and regional councils were elected in the first Guyanese election since 1964 to be internationally recognized as free and fair. Cheddi Jagan of the PPP was elected and sworn in as president on October 9, 1992. This reversed the monopoly Afro-Guyanese traditionally had over Guyanese politics. The poll was marred by violence however.\nBefore Jagan took office, a new International Monetary Fund Structural Adjustment programme was introduced which led to an increase in the GDP whilst also eroding real incomes and hitting the middle-classes hard. Jagan's government debated whether to continue to implement the IMF programme agreed to under the former administration, and decided to stick with the programme, while Jagan argued publicly that the working class of the country were harmed by these programmes. The country would join the World Trade Organization in 1995. The previous year, Guyana had joined the World Intellectual Property Organization. Guyana would also continue economic arrangements with the IMF. From July 1994 to April 1998, the country would have an Extended Credit Facility with the IMF, which continued, almost uninterrupted until September 2005.\nWhen President Jagan died of a heart attack in March 1997, Prime Minister Samuel Hinds replaced him in accordance with constitutional provisions, with his widow Janet Jagan as Prime Minister. She was then elected president on fifteenth December 1997 for the PPP. Desmond Hoyte's PNC contested the results however, resulting in strikes, riots and one death before a Caricom mediating committee was brought in. Janet Jagan's PPP government was sworn in on 24 December having agreed to a constitutional review and to hold elections within three years. However, Hoyte refused to recognise her government. Jagan later resigned in August 1999 due to ill health. She was succeeded by Finance Minister Bharrat Jagdeo, who had been named Prime Minister a day earlier. The same year, the Guyanese government secretly awarded a \"ten-year petroleum prospecting license\" to Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, a consortium which included Exxon as one of the oilfield operators, and would be awarded a license years later.\nThe Jagdeo years.\nIn 2000, Guyana would be described in \"The 21st Century World Atlas\" reference book as suffering from a \"lack of basic structures and services\", and \"poorly developed\" fishing, livestock, and forest resources, while praised for \"great efforts...in the farming and industrial sectors\". National elections were held on March 19, 2001, three months later than planned as the election committees said they were unprepared. Fears that the violence that marred the previous election led to monitoring by foreign bodies, including Jimmy Carter. In March incumbent President Jagdeo won the election with a voter turnout of over 90%. Meanwhile, tensions with Suriname were seriously strained by a dispute over their shared maritime border after Guyana had allowed oil-prospectors licence to explore the areas. The same year, a law passed allowing the government \"expropriate property in the public interest\", but the U.S. State Department noted, in 2022, that there were \"no recent cases of expropriation.\"\nIn December 2002, Hoyte died, with Robert Corbin replacing him as leader of the PNC. He agreed to engage in 'constructive engagement' with Jagdeo and the PPP. The same year, five escapees from a jail in Georgetown \"embarked on a spree of murders, kidnappings, and robberies\", calling themselves guerrilla fighters who were resisting the government. These massacres resulted in the emergency of a paramilitary unit known as the Phantom Squad, led by Shaheed \"Roger\" Khan, an Indo-Guyanese drug trafficker of cocaine, which engaged in many extrajudicial killings, primarily of Black criminals, which lasted six years, leading some to say the country had become a narco-state.\nThe PPP/C would win re-election in 2006. However, a political opposition party, Alliance for Change, formed by those who had defected from the PPP/C and the PNC, performed \"surprisingly well\", gaining it six seats in the country's parliament. Previously, scholars had argued that the country had suffered from violence and rioting during the election campaigns in 1996 and 2001.\nDuring the 2005 Georgetown flood, 34 people were killed and many crops were destroyed; around 37% to 39% of the population was in some way impacted. In 2013, the Hope Canal was completed to address the flooding.\nIn May 2008, President Bharrat Jagdeo was a signatory to the UNASUR Constitutive Treaty of the Union of South American Nations. On February 12, 2010, Guyana ratified its membership in the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR).\nCoalitions, oil drilling, and political instability.\nIn December 2011, President Bharrat Jagdeo was succeeded by Donald Ramotar of the governing People's Progressive Party (PPP/C). However, the ruling party, mainly supported by Guyana's ethnic-Indians, lost its parliamentary majority for the first time in 19 years.\nGuyana began a contract with ExxonMobil for offshore oil drilling, to tap into \"more than 10 billion barrels\" in the country's territorial waters, in May 2015, earning the country millions in oil revenues for \"development and climate adaptation.\" This has turned the country into an emerging oil producer while other countries are reducing their \"reliance on oil, coal and natural gas\" and Guyana itself is under \"dire threat\" from climate change. This \"new oil wealth\" has also led to maritime border disputes with neighboring nations, regards to resources in Guyana's exclusive economic zone. ExxonMobil later stated that they were \"firmly established\" in the country, as the country's largest oil producer, with an office in Georgetwn, and numerous ongoing offshore \"exploration and development operations offshore. In their overview, the World Bank would also note that the country had \"large offshore oil and gas reserves\", but was at \"high risk of climate induced hazards\". As noted by scholars in 2021, in the consortium engaged in offshore drilling, Exxon has 45 percent of the shares, Hess Corporation 30 percent, and the China National Offshore Oil Company has 25 percent.\nIn May 2015, David Granger of A Partnership for National Unity and Alliance for Change (APNU+AFC) narrowly won the elections. He represented the alliance of Afro-Guyanese parties, which had a slim parliamentary majority. Granger was later sworn is as the new President of Guyana. The following year, the country celebrated its 50 years of independence, with huge celebrations attended by Guyanese and Guyanese expatriates living in other countries.\nIn December 2018, the government had been defeated by a vote of no confidence in Granger, with new elections constitutionally required. However, the sitting government used various court challenges and tactics to give itself \"another year in office\" as a caretaker government.\nDisputed elections, ethnic conflict, and territorial disputes.\nIn August 2020, the 75-year-old incumbent David Granger lost narrowly and he did not accept the result. Irfaan Ali of the People's Progressive Party/Civic was sworn in as the new president five months after the election because of allegations of fraud and irregularities. Writer Gaiutra Bahadur argued that the election was \"racially driven\", that the PNC led a \"multiracial...majority-black coalition\" aiming to unseat the PPP, and stated that there were persistent rumors before the vote took place. He also described the election as a \"referendum on corruption\" and a test of coalition politics\" with various moments of \"outright violence\" and anxiety. Scholars Arif Bulkan and Alissa Trotz argued that the country's \"internecine conflict\" masks privation caused by \"extractivist and predatory capitalist models of economic development\" in the country. They noted that the Ali government, after coming to power, rushed to approve an environmental permit, opening another oil field for exploitation by Exxon.\nIn September 2020, after the election, Nafeeza Yahya-Sakur and Anatoly Kurmanaev of the New York Times stated that the murder of three individuals plunged the country into \"its worst racial unrest in years\". This follows a long history of racial tension between Indo-Guyanese people and the Afro-Guyanese people, in a country composed of five primary ethnic groups: Indians, Africans, Amerindians, Europeans (mainly Portuguese), and Chinese.\nFollowing the discovery of oil reserves in Guayana Esequiba in 2015, the territorial dispute over the region between Venezuela and Guyana escalated. In late 2023, a military buildup of Venezuelan forces on the border with Guayana Esequiba sparked a diplomatic crisis. On the 3rd of December 2023, a non-binding referendum in Venezuela was held on the annexation of the territory into Venezuela. Despite low turnout, with an estimated 2.1 million participating, 95% voted to create a Guayana Esequiba state under Venezuelan control, and granting Venezuelan citizenship to the region's inhabitants and \"implementing social programs\" for those living there. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro described the referendum as a \"moment for national unity\" and said that Venezuela is \"recovering the lands bequeathed to us by our independence heroes.\"\nThe referendum's questions were condemned by the Guyanese government, the Commonwealth of Nations Secretary-General Patricia Scotland, and Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS), Luis Almagro. Also, the leadership of the Caribbean Community voiced support for Guyana, and Brazil increased its military presence along its northern border, in response to the escalating tensions in the region. Within Venezuela, the Episcopal Conference of Venezuela called for resolving the conflict between Guyana and Venezuela peacefully, and the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV) described the referendum as the \"old strategy of the bourgeoisie [that tries] to instill patriotic and chauvinist feelings in a good part of the population (...) making people believe that in our country there is no more important problem to solve\". Some speculated that the dispute has \"raised fears of US intervention in the region\" due to U.S. backing of the Guyanese government.\nIn September 2025, Irfaan Ali re-elected for second term as Guyana\u2019s president.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "56725", "revid": "50618537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56725", "title": "Economy of Guyana", "text": "The economy of Guyana is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, with a gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 10.3% in 2025. In 2025, Guyana had a per capita gross domestic product (purchasing power parity) of Int$94,260. Guyana's economy was transformed in 2015 with the discovery of an offshore oil field in the country's waters about from Georgetown, making the first commercial-grade crude oil draw in December 2019, sending it abroad for refining.\nOverview.\nDeveloped in conjunction with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an economic recovery program significantly reduced the government's role in the economy, encouraged foreign investment, enabled the government to clear all its arrears on loan repayments to foreign governments and the multilateral banks, and brought about the sale of 15 of the 41 government-owned (parastatal) businesses. The cellphone company and assets in the timber, rice, and fishing industries also were privatized. International corporations were hired to manage the huge state sugar company, GuySuCo, and the most significant state bauxite mine. An American company was allowed to open a bauxite mine, and two Canadian companies were permitted to develop the largest open-pit gold mine in South America. However, efforts to privatize the two state-owned bauxite mining companies, Berbice Mining Company and Linden Mining Company have so far been unsuccessful.\nMost price controls were removed, the laws affecting mining and oil exploration were improved, and an investment policy receptive to foreign investment was announced. Tax reforms designed to promote exports and agricultural production in the private sector were enacted.\nDebt.\nSince 1986, Guyana has received its entire wheat supply from the United States on concessional terms under a PL 480 Food for Peace programme. It is now supplied on a grant basis. The Guyanese currency generated by the sale of the wheat is used for purposes agreed upon by the U.S. and Guyana Governments. As with many developing countries, Guyana is heavily indebted. Reduction of the debt burden has been one of the present administration's top priorities. In 1999, through the Paris Club \"Lyons terms\" and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative Guyana managed to negotiate $256 million in debt forgiveness.\nIn qualifying for HIPC assistance, for the first time, Guyana became eligible for a reduction of its multilateral debt. About half of Guyana's debt is owed to the multilateral development banks and 20% to its neighbour Trinidad and Tobago, which until 1986 was its principal supplier of petroleum products. Almost all debt to the U.S. government has been forgiven. In late 1999, net international reserves were at $123.2 million, down from $254 million in 1994. However, net international reserves had rebounded to $174.1 million by January 2001.\nGuyana's extremely high debt burden to foreign creditors has meant limited availability of foreign exchange and reduced capacity to import necessary raw materials, spare parts, and equipment, thereby further reducing production. The increase in global fuel costs also contributed to the country's decline in production and growing trade deficit. The decline of production has increased unemployment. Although no reliable statistics exist, combined unemployment and underemployment are estimated at 30%.\nEmigration, principally to the U.S. and Canada, remains substantial. Net emigration in 1998 was estimated to be about 1.4 percent of the population, and in 1999, this figure totalled 1.2 percent. After years of a state-dominated economy, the mechanisms for private investment, domestic or foreign, are still evolving. The shift from a state-controlled economy to a primarily mixed economic system began under Desmond Hoyte and continued under PPP/CIVIC governments. The current PPP/C administration recognizes the need for foreign investment to create jobs, enhance technical capabilities, and generate goods for export.\nThe foreign exchange market was fully liberalized in 1991, and currency is now freely traded without restriction. The rate is subject to change on a daily basis, but the Guyana dollar has depreciated 17.6% from 1998 to 2000 and may depreciate further pending the stability of the post-election period.\nEconomic history.\nEuropean settlement and plantation workforce.\nThe Dutch were the first to settle Guyana in the 1600s, engaging in trade with the Amerindians and establishing plantations. It was soon discovered that the soil and climate were ideal for growing sugar cane and slaves from Africa were brought in to work on these plantations. The colonies of the Guianas were merged and taken into the British empire. When slavery was abolished, a new wave of labour was brought from India as indentured servants. Politics was greatly controlled by powerful plantation owners. Portuguese and Chinese also came into the country as agricultural labour, but eventually settled into their own specific service industries.\nNationalization.\nWhen Guyana became independent from British rule, there was a great need to ensure the economy was locally owned after centuries of foreign involvement. Socialist policies were of great interest at the time, and nearly every sector of industry was nationalized during the Burnham presidency of the 1970s, with new agencies established to support the poor and working class. Initially, government investment was successful to aid growth, but lacked management skills and was weak in the face of world commodity prices and competition. Economic and political strife went hand in hand, and the population dwindled from resulting waves of emigration.\nOpening of markets.\nThe economy made dramatic progress after President Hoyte's 1989 economic recovery program. As a result, Guyana's GDP increased 6% in 1991 following 15 years of decline. Growth was consistently above six percent until 1995, when it dipped to 5.1 percent. The government reported that the economy grew at a rate of 7.9 percent in 1996, 6.2 percent in 1997, and fell 1.3 percent in 1998. The 1999 growth rate was three percent. The unofficial growth rate in 2005 was 0.5 percent. In 2006, it was 3.2%.\nInfrastructure.\nInfrastructure is primarily concentrated on the coast, and there is difficulty in building up industries in the hinterlands due to limitations of access and energy.\nMajor economic sectors.\nAgriculture and mining are Guyana's most important economic activities, with sugar, bauxite, rice, and gold accounting for 70\u201375 percent of export earnings. However, the rice sector experienced a decline in 2000, with export earnings down 27 percent through the third quarter of 2000. Ocean shrimp exports, which were heavily impacted by a one-month import ban to the United States in 1999, accounted for only 3.5 percent of total export earnings that year. Shrimp exports rebounded in 2000, representing 11 percent of export earnings through the third quarter of 2000. Other exports include timber, diamonds, garments, rum, and pharmaceuticals. The value of these other exports is increasing.\nAgriculture.\nSugar is the most historically important product of Guyana, however, the industry has been in decline due to global competition and other factors. It still is a major export, along with its related products molasses and rum. Banks DIH and Demerara Distilleries are the countries' only distillers, but Guyana is world's 14th largest exporter of rum.\nIn 2018, Guyana produced 1.2 million tonnes of sugar cane, 964 thousand tonnes of rice, 136 thousand tonnes of coconut, in addition to smaller productions of other products agricultural products, such as eggplant (47 thousand tonnes), pepper (37 thousand tonnes), pineapple (34 thousand tonnes), banana (23 thousand tonnes), orange (21 thousand tonnes), cassava (20 thousand tonnes), etc.\nMining.\nMining has surpassed the economic importance of sugar in recent years, making up a sizable portion of Guyana's GDP. The large-scale gold and bauxite mining operations are all foreign-owned, but the vast proportion of gold and diamond mining is done by small and medium-scale miners.\nPetroleum.\nIn the 2010s, significant off-shore oil finds by Exxon has renewed interest in foreign investment in the country. A 2018 estimate predicts Guyana's oilfields are holding over 3.2 billion barrels. Off-shore crude oil extraction began in 2019. \nBy 2024, oil production in Guyana had soared to approximately 645,000 barrels per day (bpd), marking a significant increase from 98,000 bpd in its initial full year of production. Guyana increased crude oil production by an annual average of 98,000 b/d from 2020 to 2023, making it the third-fastest growing non-OPEC producing country during this period. The expansion of this sector has significantly contributed to the national economy, with the petroleum industry driving a 62.3 percent GDP growth in 2022, the highest globally according to the IMF. Looking forward, Guyana plans to further boost its production capacity to about 1.3 million bpd by 2027 through the development of new projects like Yellowtail, Uaru, and Whiptail.\nIn December 2024, Guyana became the third largest per capita petroleum producing country in the world.\n2025.\nIn the first quarter of 2025, Guyana\u2019s Natural Resource Fund (NRF) received USD 605.5 million in oil revenues, including seven profit oil payments and one royalty payment. These payments were for oil produced from January to March 2025, with two payments related to December 2024 lifts. Despite an increase in daily production, the country's earnings are expected to decline due to a projected 10.9% drop in oil prices, forecasted at USD 71.9 per barrel for 2025. In 2024, Guyana's oil production grew by 57.7%, yielding 225.4 million barrels and generating USD 2.6 billion in revenue. Under the 2016 Production Sharing Agreement, Guyana receives a 2% share of oil sold and a 12.5% profit share after ExxonMobil's expenses. The country is also set to have 246 oil lifts in 2025.\nForestry.\nGuyana contains the \"largest unspoiled rainforests on the continent\". Despite the vast forests covering the country, the timber industry has remained small due to infrastructural limitations such as undeveloped roads and lacking or unreliable electricity to milling operations.\nThe country also sees large financial contributions from international organizations looking to protect the forests.\nFishing.\nMost of what is fished is consumed locally, but there is a sizable export market for ocean shrimp. Overfishing of shrimp has led to Atlantic seabob becoming the most commercially important catch. Commercial fishing is mostly marine, as inland fishing is mostly attributed to subsistence fishing done by Amerindians.\nData.\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132028 (with IMF staff estimates for 2021\u20132028).

{"id": "56726", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56726", "title": "Fish (singer)", "text": "Scottish singer\nDerek William Dick (born 25 April 1958), better known by his stage name Fish, is a retired Scottish singer, songwriter and occasional actor. He was the lead singer and lyricist of the neo-prog band Marillion from 1981 until 1988. He released 11 UK Top 40 singles with the band, including the Top 10 singles \"Kayleigh\", \"Lavender\" and \"Incommunicado\", and five Top 10 albums, including a number one with \"Misplaced Childhood\". In his solo career, Fish explored contemporary pop and traditional folk, and released a further five Top 40 singles and a Top 10 album.\nFish's voice has been described as both \"distinct\" and a \"conflation of Roger Daltrey and Peter Gabriel\", while his lyrics have been described as \"poetic prose\". In 2004, \"Classic Rock\" ranked Fish at number 49 on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Frontmen\", describing his \"theatrical delivery\" as \"a major factor in Marillion's spectacular rise, and he masterminded some uniquely ornate lyrical concepts.\" In 2009, Fish was voted at number 37 in a poll of the greatest voices in rock music by Planet Rock listeners.\nIn 2020, Fish released his final studio album \"Weltschmerz\" (German for \"world-weariness\"), to critical acclaim and commercial success. Fish toured \"Weltschmerz\" and celebrated the 30th anniversary of \"A Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors\" as part of the \"Vigil's End\" tour in 2021. Fish retired from music following a farewell tour completed in March 2025.\nEarly life.\nDerek William Dick was born on 25 April 1958 in Edinburgh, Scotland, and grew up in Dalkeith. The son of Robert and Isabella, Fish was educated at King's Park primary school and then Dalkeith High School. He was inspired by the music of many of the rock artists of the late 1960s and early 1970s, including Genesis, Pink Floyd, the Moody Blues, the Kinks, T. Rex, David Bowie, Argent, and the Sensational Alex Harvey Band (Fish would later pay tribute to these early influences on his covers album \"Songs from the Mirror\"). Fish has also cited Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell as \"one of the biggest influences on me because of her approach to lyrics\". The first band he saw live was Yes at Usher Hall, Edinburgh, in 1974. As well as his love for music, he was also a voracious reader, and his literary inspirations included Jack Kerouac, Truman Capote, Robert Burns and Dylan Thomas (all of whom would later be depicted on the sleeve of Marillion's \"Clutching at Straws\").\nFish worked as a petrol pump attendant, gardener, and from 1977 until 1980 worked in forestry at the Bowhill Estate in Selkirk. While living in Fochabers, Moray he adopted the nickname of Fish, which originated from a landlady who lamented the amount of time he spent in the bath. Fish has been quoted: \"With a real name of Derek William Dick, it became very necessary to find a nickname as quickly as possible.\"\nHe first performed as a singer in 1980 at the Golden Lion pub in Galashiels. He moved to Church Laneham, Nottinghamshire, in mid-1980 following a successful audition for the Stone Dome Band, and then to Aylesbury at the start of 1981 in the process of joining Marillion.\nMarillion.\nFish joined Marillion in 1981. The band gained popularity over the next couple of years, leading to the release of their top-ten debut album \"Script for a Jester's Tear\" in 1983. They achieved further chart success in the UK, attaining top-ten hit singles in 1985 with \"Kayleigh\" and \"Lavender\", and again in 1987 with \"Incommunicado\". In 1988, due to the stress of touring and the detrimental effect it was having on his health, as well as having a falling out with bandmate Steve Rothery,\nFish left Marillion to pursue a solo career.\nLyrics from \"Kayleigh\" were etched into paving stones in Market Square in Galashiels in 2012. The lines \"stilettoes in the snow\", and \"moon-washed college halls\" were inspired by Fish's girlfriend of the time, who was at the Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels in the 1980s.\nSolo career.\nFish's debut solo album \"Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors\" was released in January 1990. Although the recordings for the album finished in June 1989, EMI Records decided to delay the release until 1990, to avoid collision with Marillion's album \"Seasons End,\" released in September 1989. Keyboardist Mickey Simmonds who had played with Mike Oldfield, co-wrote the songs on the album, and would continue to play with Fish on the tour. Also guitarist Janick Gers co-wrote the track \"View From the Hill\". Several well known musicians contributed to the album, including former Dire Straits guitarist Hal Lindes, who played guitar on most tracks and also contributed to the writing of three of the album's songs. Frank Usher, a Fish companion from pre-Marillion times, also contributed. Drums were played by Mark Brzezicki (Big Country) and John Keeble (Spandau Ballet), John Giblin contributed bass and Lu\u00eds Jardim contributed additional percussion. Backing vocals came from Tessa Niles, who had appeared on \"Clutching at Straws\".\nMany of Fish's later works contain lengthy spoken-word lyrics, shorter examples of which can be heard on earlier Marillion albums. He has collaborated with Genesis founder Tony Banks on Banks's \"Still\" and \"Soundtracks\" albums, singing on the tracks \"Shortcut to Somewhere\", \"Angel Face\" and \"Another Murder of a Day\", co-writing the latter.\nHis solo career has never received the same recognition or attention, and to a lot of people he went missing soon after the \"Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors\" album, in February 1990, the album peaked at number 5 in the UK Albums Chart. After finishing the Vigil World Tour at Royal Albert Hall on 9 July 1990, Fish was to enter litigation with EMI records resulting in a High Court injunction that stopped him releasing new music for almost a year. The extensive touring cost him dearly and the decision to go ahead with building a new studio in his home in Haddington Scotland meant that funds were rapidly depleted along with his confidence and his creative energies.\nThe prospect of writing the follow-up for the new label, Polydor, filled him with dread. His second album \"Internal Exile\" released in October 1991, was flirting with styles but never got into a particular groove and locking into a direction. The album's music reflected Fish's indulgence in the vast regions of music that he wanted to explore as a solo artist; most notably Celtic music and folk styles. The acquisition of Chris Kimsey as producer could not save the project as he attempted to come to terms with a newly built studio and Fish plagued by bitterness and cynicism toward the industry. Polydor had rushed the album out with his acquiesence resulted in a fractured promotion campaign and low sales, and the UK promoter went bankrupt just as the tour was about to kick off.\nPolydor wanted a new studio album but Fish persisted and he decided to release an album of cover versions called \"Songs from the Mirror\". Produced by James Cassidy, whom Fish met while both were working on Jeff Waynes Spartacus album. They started recording in summer 1992 while simultaneously writing material for the next studio album \"Suits\", a cynical examination lyrically of the music business and executives who still fed Fish's cynical outlook on life. \"Songs from the Mirror\", released in January 1993, became the last album on Polydor. But the album was a turning point for Fish, and fully prepared him for the \"Suits\" sessions, material which he had been rehearsing constantly on tour as he struggled to pay bills and musicians. Fish formed his own record company, Dick Bros. after advice from a medium who passed on messages from his grandfather. The Co. was named after the garage business he had started and Fish's father had run throughout his childhood. The first release was \"Sushi\", a live album to follow the five official bootleg releases, on Battleside, a company that temporarily filled the gap between Polydor and Dick Bros., and provided Fish with a lifeline and a quality alternative to the illegal live bootlegs that had followed his career.\nHis confidence had grown and was excited about the new songs on \"Suits\" released in 1994, some of which were co-written by James Cassidy who had stayed on since producing the \"Songs from the Mirror\" album to assist employing his classical training and expertise with arrangements. It proved invaluable and together with his awareness and experience with modern production techniques the material was guaranteed to enter a new direction and to gain a momentum that would usher the solo career into a new era. Touring took precedent and Fish was well aware that road work was at the expense of writing a new studio album. He went for the break and opted for the two \"Best of's\", \"Yin and Yang\", containing re-recorded material from the Marillion era and solo albums, to give Fish the fuel and introduction to countries he had never managed to reach so far with his career. Released in 1995 these albums allowed him to stay on the road for nearly two years plugging away and hoping for the breakthrough that would give him the space to take a breath and write new material.\nIt never happened until 1997 when, after a tour in Bosnia, playing to the UN troops he reached the stage where he had to get experiences out and onto paper. Fish was introduced to Steven Wilson, who although sympathetic to the progressive rock genre, had no intention of getting involved in a regressive album, which suited Fish fine and welcomed Wilson's influence with open ears. The writing sessions were open and new songs and approaches were generated from a healthy friction between Wilson and Fish as they fought for their identities in the material. Grooves and loops led the rhythmic foundations into what they described as \"Progressive Nouveaux\", still retaining the drama and tension associated with Fish's previous work, but taking it into a more modern setting with a new edge and aggression. With Calum Malcolm's mix and Elliot Ness engineering skills provided a technical quality to match the standard of the writing on \"Sunsets on Empire\". But once again the problem of underfunded promotion and advertising was to foil Fish's plans and a 115 date tour in 22 different countries was set up to attempt to give the album the attention it deserved. Seven months after its release the tour ground to an exhausted conclusion in December 1997. With a combination of tour losses and bad debts from third parties, Fish could no longer survive as an independent artist releasing his albums through Dick Bros. He was effectively broke and financing the recording of the album \"Raingods with Zippos\" were beyond his means.\nFish was asked to take part in a writing retreat in France by Miles Copeland. Together with 23 songwriters from all over the world, Fish rediscovered himself and when he returned with new songs he was excited and eager to get on with the job of redefining his career, and writing the rest of the new album. Three songs were taken from the sessions in France for the set up for \"Raingods with Zippos\", together with a 25-minute epic called \"Plague of Ghosts\" written together with Tony Turrell and Mark Daghorn featuring Steven Wilson on guitar, and two tracks written with his old friend Mickey Simmonds. \"Raingods with Zippos\" was released by Roadrunner Records in April 1999. The \"Raingods\" album is often hailed as one of Fish's greatest solo achievements along with his 1990 debut.\nIn May 2001, Fish released his first studio album on his new independent label the Chocolate Frog Record Company, \"Fellini Days\", which Fish co-wrote with John Wesley and John Young. \"Field of Crows\" was Fish's eighth solo studio album originally released in December 2003 and then to retail in May 2004. The album was mainly co-written with Bruce Watson and Irvin Duguid.\nFish appeared at World Bowl XI, 14 June 2003, Hampden Park, Glasgow. His performance included a rousing rendition of \"Caledonia\" before kick-off. In 2005, he won a Celebrity Music edition of \"The Weakest Link\", beating Eggsy of Goldie Lookin Chain in the final round, sharing \u00a318,750 with Eggsy's charity and his own.\nOn 26 August 2007, Fish performed at the 'Hobble on The Cobbles' show at the Market Square in Aylesbury. He was accompanied on stage by his four former Marillion bandmates from the classic line-up (Mark Kelly, Steve Rothery, Ian Mosley and Pete Trewavas) for one song: \"Market Square Heroes\". This was the first time they had performed together in nearly two decades. In a press interview following the event, Fish denied this would lead to a full reunion, claiming that \"Hogarth does a great job with the band\u00a0... We forged different paths over the 19 years.\"\nHis album \"13th Star\" was released on 12 September 2007 as a specially packaged pre-release version available to order from his website. A UK tour for this album commenced in March 2008, supported by Glyder. In February 2008, Fish was confirmed to be the Friday-night headline act at NEARFest X. He also appeared with BBC Radio 2's Bob Harris on GMTV to promote Childline Rocks, a charity concert.\nIn 2008, Fish presented a Friday evening radio show, \"Fish on Friday\", for digital radio station Planet Rock. When the station was faced with closure, Malcolm Bluemel (with the help of Fish, Tony Iommi, Ian Anderson and Gary Moore) helped save Planet Rock by buying the station.\nOn 9 June 2008, Fish embarked on his first full North American tour in eleven years. At each stop, he hosted a pre-show meet-and-greet with his fans.\nOn 20 and 21 October 2012, Fish hosted Fish Convention 2012 in Leamington Spa. He performed two acoustic sets and two electric sets, including material from his then upcoming studio album, \"A Feast of Consequences\". He also performed \"Grendel\", a fan-favourite Marillion B-side, twice. \"A Feast of Consequences\" was released in September 2013 to positive reviews, supported by the single \"Blind to the Beautiful\".\nFish celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Marillion album \"Clutching at Straws\" on tour in 2018, alongside debuting material from his then upcoming studio album \"Weltschmerz\". A three track EP, \"A Parley With Angels\", was released in September 2018.\nIn April 2020, Fish revived his \"Fish on Friday\" show in the form of a weekly live video podcast, initially broadcast on Facebook (later simulcast on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter). Created during the COVID-19 pandemic to keep in touch with his fans and share stories from his career, the show was voted as the Event of the Year by \"Prog\" magazine readers in 2021. \"Fish on Friday\" remains active as of 2023, with new episodes of the show broadcast weekly.\nIn September 2020, Fish released \"Weltschmerz\", his final studio album. The album was supported by the singles \"Weltschmerz\", \"Garden of Remembrance\" and \"This Party's Over\". The album received positive reviews and was commercially successful, having sold over 60,000 copies to date. Fish toured \"Weltschmerz\" and celebrated the 30th anniversary of \"A Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors\" as part of the \"Vigil's End\" tour in 2021. The tour was documented on the live album \"Vigil's End Tour 2021\", released on physical formats in December 2022 and digitally in March 2023.\nIn November 2023, Primary Wave Music struck a deal with Fish, to acquire the singer and lyricist's master royalties and writer's share for songs he wrote and performed with Marillion.\nMusical style.\nFish has sometimes been compared to Peter Gabriel, original lead singer of Genesis in the early 1970s, and his voice has even been described as \"uncannily close\". Music journalist David Hepworth described his voice as a \"conflation of Roger Daltrey and Peter Gabriel\". Fish has acknowledged Gabriel's influence on him and some vocal similarities, but has rejected accusations from some critics during his career that he does not have a unique voice of his own. Peter Hammill of Van der Graaf Generator was also a major influence on his songwriting and vocal delivery, which is especially notable on the first two Marillion albums.\nIn 2018, Fish told Planet Rock, \"I don't look at myself as a singer, I'm not a technically gifted singer. I think one of the problems I had was back in the early Eighties I was singing very wrong, very unnatural. I think if I'd gone to see a voice coach at that point in my life they'd have said 'stop singing like that because you will not be able to keep that going for the rest of your life.'\"\nRecord labels.\nFollowing a legal dispute with EMI Records and an unsuccessful contract with Polydor, Fish established the Dick Bros Record Company in Haddington in 1993. The studio recorded \"In Amber\" by Dream Disciples (1994) and \"Man Dancin\" by Tam White in (1996). He released a number of \"official bootleg\" albums to finance the company before selling it to Roadrunner Records. Another financially unsuccessful period followed before he re-established his own Chocolate Frog Records label in 2001. He signed with Snapper Music in 2005, but later returned to Chocolate Frog Records.\nAfter having his own independent record company in the 1990s which charted a number of releases, Fish decided not to sign up to the Official Charts Company when he released \"Weltschmerz\", an album self-funded, marketed and distributed from his home in Scotland. As Fish did not partner with a record label as per chart rules and regulations, he missed out on a Top Ten chart placing when early sales revealed that he would have been number 2 on the UK midweek charts behind that week's chart topper, the independent band Idles.\nAwards.\nIn May 2008, Fish's Planet Rock show \"Fish on Friday\" won the Silver award in the Music Broadcaster of the Year category at the UK Sony Radio Academy Awards 2008. In June 2008, at the New York Festivals Radio Broadcasting Awards, he and Gary Moore jointly received the Gold World Medal in the Regularly Scheduled Music Programme category for their respective shows on Planet Rock.\nActing.\nFish was offered and accepted a part in the 1986 film \"Highlander\", for which Marillion were also offered the soundtrack, but he eventually had to turn it down owing to his tour commitments with the band. Fish first appeared on terrestrial television as himself in the \"More Bad News\" episode of the series \"The Comic Strip Presents...\" in 1988.\nHis first acting role was as a guest star in an episode of \"Zorro\" called \"The Newcomers\" (aired 10 February 1991) but a more prominent role was as the thug Ferguson alongside John Sessions in \"Jute City\", a four-part 1991 BBC drama based on a group of Masonic ruffians.\nIn 1994, he appeared in \"Chasing the Deer\", a film set during the 1745 Jacobite rebellion, as Angus Cameron. He also missed out on a role in \"Braveheart\". He spent two days with Mel Gibson in London who kept asking him to be involved but he was committed to touring his \"Suits\" album instead.\nIn 1998, he appeared as David Lawson in series 14, episode 44 of the ITV series \"The Bill\", titled \"Manhunt\", and played Derek Trout, a record producer in the series \"The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star\".\nHe appeared as Barry Judd in a 2000 episode of the TV detective series \"Rebus\" alongside John Hannah. Later that year he appeared in episode number 48, \"Skin Deep\", of the popular Scottish detective television programme \"Taggart\".\nIn 2001, he auditioned (unsuccessfully) for the James Bond film \"Die Another Day\". He then went on to appear in two episodes of \"Snoddy\", a short-lived Scottish television sitcom.\nIn 2004, Fish played Finlay Price in the TV movie \"Quite Ugly One Morning\" alongside James Nesbitt, Eddie Marsan and Annette Crosbie.\nFish appeared as Old Nick, a camp homosexual, in the 2002 crime comedy film \"9 Dead Gay Guys\".\nIn the 2005 film \"The Jacket\", Fish appeared alongside Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley as a patient in a mental institution, Jimmy Fleischer, and he played Uncle Jimmy in the 2012 comedy drama \"Electric Man\".\nPersonal life.\nOn 25 July 1987, Fish married his first wife, Tamara Nowy, a German model who appeared in the music videos for \"Kayleigh\", \"Lady Nina\", \"Sugar Mice\" and \"A Gentleman's Excuse Me\". They divorced in 2003. The marriage produced one daughter, Tara Rowena (Taz), who was born on 1 January 1991 and who, in 2012, was nominated for Scottish Model of the Year, but lost to Annie Lennox's daughter.\nFollowing the divorce, Fish entered into a relationship with Mostly Autumn singer Heather Findlay. Later, he entered into a relationship with Katie Webb, and they married in April 2009. The couple divorced after less than a year.\nOn 14 October 2017, he married his third wife, Simone R\u00f6sler, at Aberlady Church, East Lothian, Scotland.\nIn 2008, Fish stated that he would be taking at least six months off from singing due to an \"irregular cell growth\" in his throat. It was later determined not to be cancerous.\nFish is a lifelong fan of Edinburgh football club Hibernian. He also has a keen interest in marine science.\nIn mid-2023, Fish announced plans to permanently relocate to a 35-acre crofting smallholding on the Outer Hebridean island of Berneray (North Uist) with his wife in 2024/5, as he retires from the music industry.\nPolitics.\nOn politics, Fish said in 1993, \"I've got a lot of socialist trends, but I work in a capitalist industry. Getting involved in politics can be very dangerous. There are a lot of doors that can shut when you get involved in politics.\" He is a supporter of Scottish independence because he is \"dismayed\" by the UK's anti-European stance and does not believe a \"London-based government\" is \"beneficial to the UK as a whole\". Fish argued that independence could \"shake up British politics\" to ensure a more \"fair distribution of wealth\" throughout the UK. He declined to actively campaign in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum because he believed it would be \"hypocritical\" as he was planning to leave Scotland for Germany to live with his partner and her young son.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1819 the island of Funafuti, was named Ellice Island; the name Ellice was applied to all nine islands, after the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay. \nThe United States claimed Funafuti, Nukufetau, Nukulaelae and Niulakita under the Guano Islands Act of 1856. This claim was renounced under the 1983 treaty of friendship between Tuvalu and the United States.\nThe Ellice Islands came under Great Britain's sphere of influence in the late 19th century as the result of a treaty between Great Britain and Germany relating to the demarcation of the spheres of influence in the Pacific Ocean. Each of the Ellice Islands was declared a British Protectorate by Captain Herbert Gibson of , between 9 and 16 October 1892. The Ellice Islands were administered as part of the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT) as British protectorate by a Resident Commissioner from 1892 to 1916, and then as part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony from 1916 to 1976. \nIn 1974, the Ellice Islanders voted for separate British dependency status as Tuvalu, which resulted in the Gilbert Islands becoming Kiribati upon independence. The Colony of Tuvalu came into existence on 1 October 1975. Tuvalu became fully independent within the Commonwealth on 1 October 1978. On 5 September 2000, Tuvalu became the 189th member of the United Nations.\nThe Tuvalu National Library and Archives hold \"vital documentation on the cultural, social and political heritage of Tuvalu\", including surviving records from the colonial administration, as well as Tuvalu government archives.\nEarly history.\nTuvaluans are a Polynesian people, with the origins of the people of Tuvalu addressed in the theories regarding migration into the Pacific that began about 3000 years ago. There is evidence for a dual genetic origin of Pacific Islanders in Asia and Melanesia, which results from an analysis of Y chromosome (NRY) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers; there is also evidence that Fiji playing a pivotal role in west-to-east expansion within Polynesia.\nDuring pre-European-contact times there was frequent canoe voyaging between the islands, as Polynesian navigation skills are recognised to have allowed deliberate journeys on double-hulled sailing canoes or outrigger canoes. Eight of the nine islands of Tuvalu were inhabited; thus the name, Tuvalu, means \"eight standing together\" in Tuvaluan (compare to \"*walo\" meaning \"eight\" in Proto-Austronesian). Possible evidence of fire in the Caves of Nanumanga may indicate human occupation thousands of years before that. The pattern of settlement that is believed to have occurred is that the Polynesians spread out from the Samoan Islands into the Tuvaluan atolls, with Tuvalu providing a stepping stone to migration into the Polynesian Outlier communities in Melanesia and Micronesia.\nAn important creation myth of the islands of Tuvalu is the story of \"te Pusi mo te Ali\" (the Eel and the Flounder) who created the islands of Tuvalu; \"te Ali\" (the flounder) is believed to be the origin of the flat atolls of Tuvalu and \"te Pusi\" (the eel) is the model for the coconut palms that are important in the lives of Tuvaluans. The stories as to the ancestors of the Tuvaluans vary from island to island. On Niutao the understanding is that their ancestors came from Samoa in the 12th or 13th century. On Funafuti and Vaitupu the founding ancestor is described as being from Samoa; whereas on Nanumea the founding ancestor is described as being from Tonga.\nThese stories can be linked to what is known about the Samoa-based Tu'i Manu'a Confederacy, ruled by the holders of the Tu'i Man\u00fa'a title, which confederacy likely included much of Western Polynesia and some outliers at the height of its power in the 10th and 11th centuries. \nTuvalu was also thought to have been visited by Tongans in the mid-13th century and was within Tonga's sphere of influence. Captain James Cook observed and recorded his accounts of the Tu\u02bbi Tonga kings during his visits to the Friendly Isles of Tonga. By observing such Pacific cultures as Tuvalu and Uvea, the influence of the Tu\u02bbi Tonga line of Tongan kings and the existence of the Tu\u02bbi Tonga Empire, which originated in the 10th century, was quite strong and has had more of an impact in Polynesia and also parts of Micronesia than the Tu'i Manu'a.\nThe oral history of Niutao recalls that in the 15th century Tongan warriors were defeated in a battle on the reef of Niutao. Tongan warriors also invaded Niutao later in the 15th century and again were repelled. A third and fourth invasion of Tongan occurred in the late 16th century, again with the Tongans being defeated.\nTuvalu is on the western boundary of the Polynesian Triangle so that the northern islands of Tuvalu, particularly Nui, have links to Micronesians from Kiribati. The oral history of Niutao also recalls that during the 17th century warriors invaded from the islands of Kiribati on two occasions and were defeated in battles fought on the reef.\nVoyages by Europeans in the Pacific.\nTuvalu was first sighted by Europeans on 16 January 1568, during the voyage of \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a de Neira, Spanish explorer and cartographer, who sailed past the island of Nui, and charted it as \"Isla de Jes\u00fas\" (Spanish for \"Island of Jesus\"). This was because the previous day had been the feast of the Holy Name. Menda\u00f1a made contact with the islanders but was unable to land. During Menda\u00f1a's second voyage across the Pacific he passed Niulakita on 29 August 1595, which he named \"La Solitaria\".\nCaptain John Byron passed through the islands of Tuvalu in 1764 during his circumnavigation of the globe as captain of the . Byron charted the atolls as \"Lagoon Islands\".\nThe first recorded sighting of Nanumea by Europeans was by Spanish naval officer Francisco Mourelle de la R\u00faa who sailed past it on 5 May 1781 as captain of the frigate \"La Princesa\", when attempting a southern crossing of the Pacific from the Philippines to New Spain. He charted Nanumea as \"San Augustin\". Keith S. Chambers and Doug Munro (1980) identified Niutao as the island that Mourelle also sailed past on 5 May 1781, thus solving what Europeans had called \"The Mystery of Gran Cocal\". Mourelle's map and journal named the island \"El Gran Cocal\" ('The Great Coconut Plantation'); however, the latitude and longitude was uncertain. Longitude could only be reckoned crudely as accurate chronometers were not available until the late 18th century. Laumua Kofe (1983) accepts Chambers and Munro's conclusions, with Kofe describing Mourelle's ship \"La Princesa\", as waiting beyond the reef, with Nuitaoans coming out in canoes, bringing some coconuts with them. \"La Princesa\" was short of supplies but Mourelle was forced to sail on \u2013 naming Niutao, \"El Gran Cocal\" ('The Great Coconut Plantation').\nIn 1809, Captain Patterson in the brig \"Elizabeth\" sighted Nanumea while passing through the northern Tuvalu waters on a trading voyage from Port Jackson, Sydney, Australia to China.\nIn May 1819, Arent Schuyler de Peyster, of New York, captain of the armed brigantine or privateer \"Rebecca\", sailing under British colours, passed through the southern Tuvaluan waters while on a voyage from Valpara\u00edso to India; de Peyster sighted Funafuti, which he named Ellice's Island after an English politician, Edward Ellice, the Member of Parliament for Coventry and the owner of the Rebecca's cargo. The next morning, de Peyster sighted another group of about seventeen low islands forty-three miles northwest of Funafuti, which was named \"De Peyster's Islands.\" It is the first name, Nukufetau, that was eventually used for this atoll.\nIn 1820 the Russian explorer Mikhail Lazarev visited Nukufetau as commander of the \"Mirny\". Louis Isidore Duperrey, captain of \"La Coquille\", sailed past Nanumanga in May 1824 during a circumnavigation of the earth (1822\u20131825). A Dutch expedition by the frigate \"Maria Reigersberg\" under captain Koerzen, and the corvette \"Pollux\" under captain C. Eeg, found Nui on the morning of 14 June 1825 and named the main island (Fenua Tapu) as \"Nederlandsch Eiland\".\nWhalers began roving the Pacific, although visiting Tuvalu only infrequently because of the difficulties of landing on the atolls. Captain George Barrett of the Nantucket whaler \"Independence II\" has been identified as the first whaler to hunt the waters around Tuvalu. In November 1821 he bartered coconuts from the people of Nukulaelae and also visited Niulakita. A shore camp was established on Sakalua islet of Nukufetau, where coal was used to melt down the whale blubber.\nFor less than a year between 1862 and 1863, Peruvian ships engaged in the so-called \"blackbirding\" trade, combed the smaller islands of Polynesia from Easter Island in the eastern Pacific to Tuvalu and the southern atolls of the Gilbert Islands (now Kiribati), seeking recruits to fill the extreme labour shortage in Peru, including workers to mine the guano deposits on the Chincha Islands. On Funafuti and Nukulaelae, the resident traders facilitated the recruiting of the islanders by the \"blackbirders\". The Rev. Archibald Wright Murray, the earliest European missionary in Tuvalu, reported that in 1863 about 180 people were taken from Funafuti and about 200 were taken from Nukulaelae, as there were fewer than 100 of the 300 recorded in 1861 as living on Nukulaelae.\nTrading firms &amp; traders.\nJohn (also known as Jack) O'Brien was the first European to settle in Tuvalu, he became a trader on Funafuti in the 1850s. He married Salai, the daughter of the paramount chief of Funafuti. The Sydney firms of Robert Towns and Company, J. C. Malcolm and Company, and Macdonald, Smith and Company, pioneered the coconut-oil trade in Tuvalu. The German firm of J.C. Godeffroy und Sohn of Hamburg established operations in Apia, Samoa. In 1865 a trading captain acting on behalf of J.C. Godeffroy und Sohn obtained a 25-year lease to the eastern islet of Niuoko of Nukulaelae atoll.\nFor many years the islanders and the Germans argued over the lease, including its terms and the importation of labourers, however the Germans remained until the lease expired in 1890. By the 1870s J. C. Godeffroy und Sohn began to dominate the Tuvalu copra trade, which company was in 1879 taken over by Handels-und Plantagen-Gesellschaft der S\u00fcdsee-Inseln zu Hamburg (DHPG). Competition came from Ruge, Hedemann &amp; Co, established in 1875, which was succeeded by H. M. Ruge and Company, and from Henderson and Macfarlane of Auckland, New Zealand.\nThese trading companies engaged palagi traders who lived on the islands, some islands would have competing traders with dryer islands only have a single trader. Louis Becke, who later found success as a writer, was a trader on Nanumanga, working with the Liverpool firm of John S. de Wolf and Co., from April 1880 until the trading-station was destroyed later that year in a cyclone. He then became a trader on Nukufetau. George Westbrook and Alfred Restieaux operated trade stores on Funafuti, which were destroyed in a cyclone that struck in 1883.\nH. M. Ruge and Company, a German trading firm that operated from Apia, Samoa, caused controversy when it threatened to seize the entire island of Vaitupu unless a debt of $13,000 was repaid. The debt was the result of the failed operations of the Vaitupu Company, which had been established by Thomas William Williams, with part of the debt relating to the attempts to operate the trading schooner \"Vaitupulemele\". The Vaitupuans continue to celebrate Te Aso Fiafia (Happy Day) on 25 November of each year. Te Aso Fiafia commemorates 25 November 1887 which was the date on which the final instalment of the debt of $13,000 was repaid.\nFrom the late 1880s changes occurred with steamships replacing sailing vessels. Over time the number of competing trading companies diminished, beginning with Ruge's bankruptcy in 1888 followed by the withdrawal of the DHPG from trading in Tuvalu in 1889/90. In 1892 Captain Edward Davis of , reported on trading activities and traders on each of the islands visited. Captain Davis identified the following traders in the Ellice Group: Edmund Duffy (Nanumea); Jack Buckland (Niutao); Harry Nitz (Vaitupu); John (also known as Jack) O'Brien (Funafuti); Alfred Restieaux and Emile Fenisot (Nukufetau); and Martin Kleis (Nui). The 1880s was the time at which the greatest number of palagi traders lived on the atolls. In 1892 the traders either acted as agent for Henderson and Macfarlane, or traded on their own account.\nFrom around 1900, Henderson and Macfarlane operating their vessel SS \"Archer\" in the South Pacific with a trading route to Fiji and the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. New competition came from Burns Philp, operating from what is now Kiribati, with competition from Levers Pacific Plantations starting in 1903. Captain Ernest Frederick Hughes Allen of the Samoa Shipping and Trading Company competed for copra in the Ellice Islands, and the sale of goods to the islanders, when he built a trading store on Funafuti in 1911. In June 1914 he made Funafuti the operational base of the company, until the company was liquidated in 1925. Burns Philp continued to operate in the Ellice Islands, the company transferred the wooden auxiliary schooner \"Murua\" (253 tons) to the Tarawa - Ellice Islands run, until the vessel was wrecked at Nanumea in April 1921.\nAfter the high point in the 1880s, the numbers of palagi traders in Tuvalu declined. In the 1890s, structural changes occurred in the operation of the Pacific trading companies; they moved from a practice of having traders resident on each island to instead becoming a business operation where the supercargo (the cargo manager of a trading ship) would deal directly with the islanders when a ship visited an island. By 1909 there were no resident palagi traders representing the trading firms. The last of the traders were Martin Kleis on Nui, Fred Whibley on Niutao and Alfred Restieaux on Nukufetau; who remained in the islands until their deaths.\nTuvaluans became responsible for operating trading stores on each island. In 1926, Donald Gilbert Kennedy was the headmaster of Elisefou (New Ellice) on Vaitupu. He was instrumental in establishing the first co-operative store (\"fusi\") on Vaitupu, which became a model for the bulk purchasing and selling cooperative stores established in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony to replace the stores operated by Palangi traders.\nScientific expeditions &amp; travellers.\nThe United States Exploring Expedition, under Charles Wilkes, visited Funafuti, Nukufetau and Vaitupu in 1841. During the visit, Alfred Thomas Agate, engraver and illustrator, recorded the clothing and tattoo patterns of men of Nukufetau.\nIn 1885 or 1886, the New Zealand photographer Thomas Andrew visited Funafuti and Nui.\nIn 1890 Robert Louis Stevenson, his wife Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson, and her son Lloyd Osbourne sailed on the \"Janet Nicoll\", a trading steamer owned by Henderson and Macfarlane of Auckland, New Zealand, which operated between Sydney, Auckland and into the central Pacific. The \"Janet Nicoll\" visited three of the Ellice Islands; while Fanny records that they made landfall at Funafuti, Niutao and Nanumea; however Jane Resture suggests that it was more likely they landed at Nukufetau rather than Funafuti, as Fanny describes meeting Alfred Restieaux and his wife Litia; however they had been living on Nukufetau since the 1880s. An account of the voyage was written by Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson and published under the title \"The Cruise of the Janet Nichol\", together with photographs taken by Robert Louis Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne.\nIn 1894 Count Rudolf Festetics de Tolna, his wife Eila (n\u00e9e Haggin) and her daughter Blanche Haggin visited Funafuti aboard the yacht \"Le Tolna\". \"Le Tolna\" spent several days at Funafuti with the Count photographing men and women on Funafuti.\nThe boreholes on Funafuti at the site now called \"Darwin's Drill\", are the result of drilling conducted by the Royal Society of London for the purpose of investigating the formation of coral reefs and the question as to whether traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the coral of Pacific atolls. This investigation followed the work on The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs conducted by Charles Darwin in the Pacific. Drilling occurred in 1896, 1897 and 1911. In 1896 Professor Edgeworth David of the University of Sydney went to the Pacific atoll of Funafuti as part of the \"Funafuti Coral Reef Boring Expedition of the Royal Society\", under Professor William Sollas. There were defects in the boring machinery and the bore penetrated only slightly more than 100 feet (approx. 31\u00a0m).\nProf. Sollas published a report on the study of Funafuti atoll, and Charles Hedley, a naturalist, at the Australian Museum, collected Invertebrate and Ethnological objects on Funafuti. The descriptions of these were published in \"Memoir III of the Australian Museum Sydney\" between 1896 and 1900. Hedley also write the \"General Account of the Atoll of Funafuti\", \"The Ethnology of Funafuti\" and \"The Mollusca of Funafuti\". Edgar Waite also was part of the 1896 expedition and published an account of \"The mammals, reptiles, and fishes of Funafuti\". William Rainbow described the spiders and insects collected at Funafuti in \"The insect fauna of Funafuti\".\nIn 1897 Edgeworth David led a second expedition (that included George Sweet as second-in-command, and Walter George Woolnough) which succeeded in reaching a depth of . David then organised a third expedition in 1898 which, under the leadership of Dr. Alfred Edmund Finckh, was successful in deepening the bore to . The results provided support for Charles Darwin's theory of subsidence. Cara Edgeworth accompanied her husband on the second expedition and published a well-received account called \"Funafuti, or Three Months on a Coral Island\". Photographers on the expeditions recorded people, communities and scenes at Funafuti.\nHarry Clifford Fassett, captain's clerk and photographer, recorded people, communities and scenes at Funafuti in 1900 during a visit of USFC \"Albatross\" when the United States Fish Commission were investigating the formation of coral reefs on Pacific atolls.\nPre-Christian beliefs.\nLaumua Kofe (1983) describes the objects of worship as varying from island to island, although ancestor worship was described by the Rev. Samuel James Whitmee in 1870 as being common practice.\nIn 1896 Professor William Sollas went to Funafuti as the leader of the \"Funafuti Coral Reef Boring Expedition of the Royal Society\", and with the assistance of Jack O'Brien (as interpreter), he recorded an oral history of Funafuti given by Erivara, the chief of Funafuti, which he published as \"The Legendary History of Funafuti\". Erivara provided an account of the kings (chiefs) of Funafuti and a description of the spiritual beliefs before the introduction of Christianity. The beliefs evolved over time. In the beginning the people worshipped the powers of nature, such as thunder and lightening, as well as birds and fishes. Then the worship of spirits became the belief system, such as Tufakala who was named after a variety of seagull. Eventually the belief system was centred on the priests or spirit-masters (\"vaka-atua\" or \"vakatua\"), who were the intermediaries between the people and spirits, deities and fetish objects, such as an unusual red stone called the Teo. Another fetish object was a hat made out of red, white and black pandanus leaves and adorned with white shells, called the Pulau, which was said to be the hat of Firapu, an ancestor who had been deified. Daily activities such as fishing and cultivation of crops were connected to ceremonies involving the fetish objects and to specific spirits or deities. The \"vaka-atua\" were also the healers. Erivara described the destruction of the fetish houses, and the influence of the \"vaka-atua\", by the trader Jack O\u2019Brien in the decade before the arrival of Christian missionaries on Funafuti.\nThe arrival of Christian missionaries.\nTraders, such as Tom Rose at Nukulaelae and Robert Waters at Nui, actively proselytized Christianity. Rose by holding services on Sundays. Although Waters, and other traders, such Charlie Douglas at Niutao and Jack O\u2019Brien at Funafuti, had economic motives in destroying the ancient religions so that the islanders were more focused on the copra and coconut oil trade.\nThe first Christian missionary came to Tuvalu in 1861 when Elekana, a Christian deacon from Manihiki in the Cook Islands became caught in a storm and drifted for 8 weeks before landing at Nukulaelae. Once there, Elekana began proselytizing Christianity. He was trained at Malua Theological College, a London Missionary Society school in Samoa, before beginning his work in establishing what became the Church of Tuvalu.\nIn 1865 the Rev. Archibald Wright Murray of the London Missionary Society \u2013 a Protestant congregationalist missionary society \u2013 arrived as the first European missionary where he too proselytized among the Ellice Islanders. The Rev. Samuel James Whitmee visited the islands in 1870. By 1878 Protestantism was well established with preachers on each island. In the later 19th century the ministers of what became the Church of Tuvalu were predominantly Samoans, who influenced the development of the Tuvaluan language and the music of Tuvalu. Westbrook, a trader on Funafuti, reported that the pastors impose strict rules on all people on the island, including demanding attendance at church and forbidding cooking on a Sunday.\nColonial administration.\n\"SMS Ariadne\", a steam corvette of the German (Imperial Navy), called at Funafuti and Vaitupu in 1878. Captain Werner imposed trade and friendship treaties on the islanders giving Germany most-favored-nation treatment, and he intervened to assist the DHPG trader at Vaitupu, Harry Nitz, in a dispute over land. In 1883 \"SMS Hy\u00e4ne\", a gunboat, called at Funafuti.\nIn 1886 Britain and Germany agreed to divide up the western and central Pacific, with each claiming a 'sphere of influence'. In the previous decade German traders had become active in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, Marshall Islands and the Caroline Islands. In 1877 the Governor of Fiji was given the additional title of High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. However, the claim of a 'sphere of influence' that included the Ellice Islands and the Gilbert Islands did not result in the immediate move to govern those islands. \nShips of the Royal Navy known to have visited the islands in the 19th century are: \nFrom 1892 to 1916 the Ellice Islands were administered as a British protectorate, as part of the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT), by a Resident Commissioner based in the Gilbert Islands. The first Resident Commissioner was Charles Richard Swayne, who collected the ordinances of each island of Tuvalu that had been established by the Samoan pastors of the London Missionary Society. These ordinances were the basis of the \"Native Laws of the Ellice Islands\" that were issued by Swayne in 1894. The Native Laws established and administrative structure for each island and well as prescribing criminal laws. The Native Laws also made it compulsory for children to attend school. On each island the High Chief (\"Tupu\") was responsible for maintaining order; with a magistrate and policemen also responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the law. The High Chief was assisted by the councillors (\"Falekaupule\"). The \"Falekaupule\" on each of the Islands of Tuvalu is the traditional assembly of elders or \"te sina o fenua\" (literally: \"grey-hairs of the land\" in the Tuvaluan language). The \"Kaupule\" on each island is the executive arm of the \"Falekaupule\". The second Resident Commissioner was William Telfer Campbell (1895\u20131909), who established land registers that would assist in resolving disputes over title to land. Arthur Mahaffy was a District Officer in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Protectorate from 1895 to 1897. In 1909, Geoffrey B. W. Smith-Rewse was appointed as the District Officer to administer the Ellice Islands from Funafuti and remained in that position until 1915.\nIn 1916 the administration of the BWTP ended and the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony was established, which existed from 1916 to 1974. In 1917 revised laws were issue, which abolished the office of High Chief and limited the number of members of the \"Kaupule\" on each island. Under the 1917 laws the \"Kaupule\" of each island could issue local regulations. Under the revised rules the magistrate was most important official and the senior person of the \"Kaupule\" was the deputy magistrate. The Colony continued to be administered by the Resident Commissioner, based in the Gilbert Islands, with a District Officer based on Funafuti.\nIn 1930 the Resident Commissioner, Arthur Grimble, issued revised laws, \"Regulations for the good Order and Cleanliness of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands\". The Regulations removed the ability of the \"Kaupule\" to issue local regulations, and proscribed stringent rules of public and private behaviour. The attempts of the islanders to have the Regulations changed were ignored until Henry Evans Maude, a government officer, sent a copy to a member of the English Parliament.\nDonald Gilbert Kennedy arrived in 1923 and took charge of a newly established government school on Funafuti. The following year he transferred \"Elisefou\" school to Vaitupu as the food supply was better on that island. In 1932 Kennedy was appointed the District officer on Funafuti, which office he held until 1939. Colonel Fox-Strangways, was the Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony in 1941, who was located on Funafuti.\nAfter World War II, Kennedy encouraged Neli Lifuka in the resettlement proposal that eventually resulted in the purchase of Kioa island in Fiji.\nThe Pacific War and Operation Galvanic.\nDuring the Second World War, as a British colony, the Ellice Islands were aligned with the Allies. Early in the war, the Japanese invaded and occupied Makin, Tarawa and other islands in what is now Kiribati, however their further expansion to other islands were delayed by their losses at the Battle of the Coral Sea.\nThe United States Marine Corps landed on Funafuti on 2 October 1942 and on Nanumea and Nukufetau in August 1943. The Ellice Islands were used as a base to prepare for the subsequent seaborn attacks on the Gilbert Islands (Kiribati) that were occupied by Japanese forces.\nCoastwatchers were stationed on some of the islands to identify any Japanese activity, such as Neli Lifuka on Vaitupu. The islanders assisted the American forces to build airfields on Funafuti, Nanumea and Nukufetau and to unload supplies from ships. On Funafuti the islanders were shifted to the smaller islets so as to allow the American forces to build the airfield, a 76-bed hospital and Naval Base Funafuti on Fongafale islet.\nThe construction of the airfields resulted in the loss of coconut trees and gardens, however, the islanders benefited from the food and luxury goods supplied by the American forces. The estimates of the loss of food producing trees was that 55,672 coconuts trees, 1,633 breadfruit trees and 797 pandanus trees were destroyed on those three islands. Building the runway at Funafuti involved the loss of land used for growing pulaka and taro with extensive excavation of coral from 10 borrow pits. \nA detachment of the 2nd Naval Construction Battalion (the Seabees) built a sea plane ramp on the lagoon side of Fongafale islet for seaplane operations by both short and long range seaplanes and a compacted coral runway was constructed on Fongafale, which was 5,000 feet long and 250 feet wide and was then extended to 6,600 feet long and 600 feet wide. On 15 December 1942 four VOS float planes (Vought OS2U Kingfisher) from VS-1-D14 arrived at Funafuti to carry out anti-submarine patrols. PBY Catalina flying boats of US Navy Patrol Squadrons were stationed at Funafuti for short periods of time, including VP-34, which arrived at Funafuti on 18 August 1943 and VP-33, which arrived on 26 September 1943.\nIn April 1943, a detachment of the 3rd Battalion constructed an aviation-gasoline tank farm on Fongafale. The 16th Battalion arrived in August 1943 to build Nanumea Airfield and Nukufetau Airfield. The atolls were described as providing \"unsinkable aircraft carriers\" during the preparation for the Battle of Tarawa and the Battle of Makin that commenced on 20 November 1943, which was the implementation of \"Operation Galvanic\".\nUSS \"LST-203\" was grounded on the reef at Nanumea on 2 October 1943 in order to land equipment. The rusting hull of the ship remains on the reef. The Seabees also blasted an opening in the reef at Nanumea, which became known as the 'American Passage'.\nThe 5th and 7th Defense Battalions were stationed in the Ellice Islands to provide the defense of various naval bases. The 51st Defense Battalion relieved the 7th in February 1944 on Funafuti and Nanumea until they were transferred to Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands in July 1944.\nThe first offensive operation was launched from the airfield at Funafuti on 20 April 1943 when twenty-two B-24 \"Liberator\" bombers from 371 and 372 Bombardment Squadrons struck Nauru. The next day the Japanese made a predawn raid on the strip at Funafuti which destroyed one B-24 and caused damage to five other planes. On 22 April 12 B-24 aircraft struck Tarawa. The airfield at Funafuti became the headquarters of the United States Army Air Forces VII Bomber Command in November 1943, directing operations against Japanese forces on Tarawa and other bases in the Gilbert Islands. USAAF B-24 \"Liberator\" bombers of the 11th Wing, 30th Bombardment Group, 27th Bombardment Squadron and 28th Bombardment Squadron operated from Funafuti Airfield, Nanumea Airfield and Nukufetau Airfield. The 45th Fighter Squadron operated P-40Ns from Nanumea and Marine Attack Squadron 331 (VMA-331) operated Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers from Nanumea and Nukufetau.\nFunafuti suffered air attacks during 1943. Casualties were limited, although tragedy was averted on 23 April 1943, when 10 to 20 people took refuge in the concrete walled, pandanus-thatched church. Corporal Fonnie Black Ladd, USMCR, persuaded them to get into dugouts, then a bomb struck the church shortly after; in that raid, 2 American soldiers and an elderly Tuvaluan man named Esau were killed. Japanese airplanes continued to raided Funafuti, attacking on 12 &amp; 13 November 1943 and again on 17 November 1943.\nUSN Patrol Torpedo Boats (PTs) were based at Funafuti from 2 November 1942 to 11 May 1944. Squadron 1B arrived on 2 November 1942 with as the support ship, which remained until 25 November 1942. On 22 December 1942 Squadron 3 Division 2 (including PTs 21, 22, 25 &amp; 26) arrived with the combined squadron commanded by Lt. Jonathan Rice. In July 1943 Squadron 11-2 (including PTs 177, 182, 185, and 186) under the command of Lt. John H. Stillman relieved Squadron 3\u20132. The PT Boats operated from Funafuti against Japanese shipping in the Gilbert Islands; although they were primarily involved in patrol and rescue duty. A \"Kingfisher\" float plane rescued Captain Eddie Rickenbacker and aircrew from life-rafts near Nukufetau, with PT 26 from Funafuti completing the rescue. Motor Torpedo Boat operations ceased at Funafuti in May 1944 and Squadron 11-2 was transferred to Emirau Island, New Guinea.\nThe reached Funafuti on 21 January 1944. The \"Alabama\" left the Ellice Islands on 25 January to participate in \"Operation Flintlock\" in the Marshall Islands. By the middle of 1944, as the fighting moved further north towards Japan, the Americans forces were redeployed. By the time the war ended in 1945 nearly all of them had departed, together with their equipment. After the war the military airfield on Funafuti was developed into Funafuti International Airport.\nTransition to self-government.\nThe formation of the United Nations Organisation after World War II resulted in the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization committing to a process of decolonization; as a consequence the British colonies in the Pacific started on a path to self-determination. The initial focus was on the development of the administration of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. In 1947 Tarawa, in the Gilbert Islands, was made the administrative capital. This development included establishing the King George V Secondary School for boys and the Elaine Bernacchi Secondary School for girls.\nA Colony Conference was organised at Marakei in 1956, which was attended by officials and representatives from each island in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony, conferences were held every 2 years until 1962. The development of administration continued with the creation in 1963 of an Advisory Council of 5 officials and 12 representatives who were appointed by the Resident Commissioner. In 1964 an Executive Council was established with 8 officials and 8 representatives. The Resident Commissioner was now required to consult the Executive Council regarding the creation of laws to making decisions that affected the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.\nThe system of local government on each island established in the colonial era continued until 1965 when Island Councils were established with the islanders electing the councillors who then choose the President of the council. The Executive Officer of each Local Council was appointed by the central government.\nA constitution was introduced in 1967, which created a House of Representatives for the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony that comprised 7 appointed officials and 23 members elected by the islanders. Tuvalu elected 4 members of the House of Representatives. The 1967 constitution also established the Governing Council. The House of Representatives only had the authority to recommend laws; the Governing Council had the authority to enact laws following a recommendation from the House of Representatives.\nA select committee of the House of Representatives was established to consider whether the constitution should be changes to give legislative power to the House of Representatives. The proposal was that Ellice Islanders would be allocated 4 seats out of a 24-member parliament, which reflected the differences in populations between Elice Islanders and Gilbertese. It became apparent that the Tuvaluans were concerned about their minority status in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony and the Tuvaluans wanted equal representation to that of the I-Kiribati. A new constitution was introduced in 1971, which provided that each of the islands of Tuvalu (except Niulakita) elected one representative. However, that did not end the Tuvaluan movement for independence.\nIn 1974 ministerial government was introduced to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony through a change to the Constitution. In that year a general election was held; and a referendum was held in 1974 to determine whether the Gilbert Islands and Ellice Islands should each have their own administration. The result of the referendum, was that 3,799 Elliceans voted for separation from the Gilbert Islands and continuance of British rule as a separate colony, and 293 Elliceans voted to remain as the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony. There were 40 spoilt papers.\nAs a consequence of the referendum, separation occurred in two stages. The Tuvaluan Order 1975, which took effect on 1 October 1975, recognised Tuvalu as a separate British dependency with its own government. The second stage occurred on 1 January 1976 when separate administrations were created out of the civil service of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.\nElections to the House of Assembly of the British Colony of Tuvalu were held on 27 August 1977; with Toaripi Lauti being appointed Chief Minister in the House of Assembly of the Colony of Tuvalu on 1 October 1977. The House of Assembly was dissolved in July 1978 with the government of Toaripi Lauti continuing as a caretaker government until the 1981 elections were held. \nToaripi Lauti became the first Prime Minister of the Parliament of Tuvalu or \"Palamene o Tuvalu\" on 1 October 1978 when Tuvalu became an independent nation.\nThe place at which the parliament sits is called the \"Vaiaku maneapa\".\nLocal government of each island by the Falekaupule and Kaupule.\nThe \"Falekaupule\" on each of the Islands of Tuvalu is the traditional assembly of elders or \"te sina o fenua\" (literally: \"grey-hairs of the land\" in the Tuvaluan language). Under the Falekaupule Act (1997), the powers and functions of the \"Falekaupule\" are now shared with the \"Kaupule\" on each island, which is the executive arm of the \"Falekaupule\", whose members are elected. The \"Kaupule\" has an elected president \u2013 \"pule o kaupule\"; an appointed treasurer \u2013 \"ofisa ten tupe\"; and is managed by a committee appointed by the \"Kaupule\".\nThe Falekaupule Act (1997) defines the \"Falekaupule\" to mean the \"traditional assembly in each island ... composed in accordance with the Aganu of each island\". \"Aganu\" means traditional customs and culture. The \"Falekaupule\" on each island has existed from time immemorial and continue to act as the local government of each island.\nThe \"maneapa\" on each island is traditionally an open meeting place where the chiefs and elders deliberate and make decisions. In modern times a \"maneapa\" is a building in which people meet for community meetings or celebrations. The \"maneapa\" system is the rule of the traditional chiefs and elders.\nBroadcasting and news media.\nFollowing independence the only newspaper publisher and public broadcasting organisation in Tuvalu was the Broadcasting and Information Office (BIO) of Tuvalu. The Tuvalu Media Corporation (TMC) was a government-owned corporation established in 1999 to take over the radio and print based publications of the BIO. However, in 2008 operating as a corporation was determined not to be commercial viable and the Tuvalu Media Corporation then became the Tuvalu Media Department (TMD) under the Office of the Prime Minister.\nHealth services.\nA hospital was established at Funafuti in 1913 at the direction of Geoffrey \nB. W. Smith-Rewse, during his tenure as the District Officer at Funafuti from 1909 to 1915. At this time Tuvalu was known as the Ellice Islands and was administered as a British protectorate as part of the British Western Pacific Territories. In 1916 the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony was established. From 1916 to 1919 the hospital was under the supervision of Dr J. G. McNaughton, when he resigned the position remained vacant until 1930, when Dr D. C. Macpherson was appointed the medical doctor at the hospital. He remain in the position until 1933, when he was appointed to a position in Suva, Fiji.\nDuring the time of the colonial administration, Tuvaluans provided medical services at the hospital after receiving training to become doctors or nurses (the male nurses were known as 'Dressers') at the Suva Medical School, which changed its name to Central Medical School in 1928 and which later became the Fiji School of Medicine. Training was provided to Tuvaluans who graduated with the title Native Medical Practitioners. The medical staff on each island were assisted by women's committees which, from about 1930, played an important role in health, hygiene and sanitation.\nDuring World War II the hospital on Fongafale atoll was dismantled as the American forces built an airfield on this atoll. The hospital was shifted to Funafala atoll under the responsibility of Dr Ka, while Dr Simeona Peni provided medical services to the American forces at the 76-bed hospital on Fongafale that was built by the Americans at Vailele. After the war the hospital returned to Fongafale and used the American hospital until 1947 when a new hospital was built. However, the hospital built in 1947 was incomplete because of problems in the supply of building materials. Cyclone Bebe struck Funafuti in late October 1972 and caused extensive damage to the hospital.\nIn 1974 Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony was dissolved and the Colony of Tuvalu was established. Tuvalu regained independence on 1 October 1978. A new 38-bed central hospital was built at Fakaifou on Fongafale atoll, with New Zealand aid grant. It was completed in 1975 and officially opened on 29 September 1978 by Princess Margaret after whom the hospital was named. The building now occupied by the Princess Margaret Hospital was completed in 2003 with the building financed by the Japanese government. The Department of Health also employ nine or ten nurses on the outer islands to provide general nursing and midwifery services.\nNon-government organizations provide health services, such as the Tuvalu Red Cross Society; Fusi Alofa Association Tuvalu (which is an association for persons with disabilities); the Tuvalu Family Health Association (which provides training and support on sexual and reproductive health); and the Tuvalu Diabetics Association (which provides training and support on diabetes).\nTuvaluans have consulted, and continue to consult, a herbal medicine practitioner (\"Tufuga\" or \"tofuga\"). Tuvaluans would see a \"Tufuga\" both as a substitute for treatment from a trained doctor of medicine and as an additional source of medical assistance while also accessing orthodox medical treatment. On the island of Nanumea in 1951, Malele Tauila, was a well-known \"Tufuga\". An example of a herbal medicine derived from local flora, is a treatment for ear ache made out of a pandanus (\"pandanus tectorius\") tree's root. \"Tufuga\" also provide a form of massage.\nEducation in Tuvalu.\nThe development of the education system.\nThe London Missionary Society (LMS) established a mission school at Papaelise on Funafuti; Sarah Jolliffe was the teacher for some years. The LMS established a primary school at Motufoua on Vaitupu in 1905. The purpose was to prepare young men for entry into the LMS seminary in Samoa. This school evolved into the Motufoua Secondary School. There was also a school called Elisefou (New Ellice) on Vaitupu. The school was established in Funafuti in 1923 and moved to Vaitupu in 1924. It closed in 1953. Its first headmaster, Donald Gilbert Kennedy (1923\u20131932), was a known disciplinarian who would not hesitate to discipline his students. He was succeeded as headmaster by Melitiana of Nukulaelae. In 1953 government schools were established on Nui, Nukufetau and Vaitupu and in the following year on the other islands. These schools replace the existing primary schools. However, the schools did not have capacity for all children until 1963, when the government improved educational standards.\nFrom 1953 until 1975 Tuvaluan students could sit the selection tests for admission to the King George V Secondary School for boys (which opened in 1953) and the Elaine Bernacchi Secondary School for girls. These schools were located on Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands (now Kiribati), which was the administrative centre of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony. In 1965 King George V and Elaine Bernacchi School were merged. Tarawa was also the location for training institutions such as the teachers college and the nursing centre.\nThe activities of the LMS were taken over by the Church of Tuvalu. From 1905 to 1963 Motufoua only admitted students from LMS church schools. In 1963 the LMS and the government of Tuvalu began to co-operate in providing education and students were enrolled from government schools. In 1970 a secondary school for girls was opened at Motufoua. In 1974, the Ellice Islanders voted for separate British dependency status as Tuvalu, separating from the Gilbert Islands which became Kiribati. The following year the students that attended school on Tawara were transferred to Motufoua. From 1975 the Church of Tuvalu and the government jointly administer the School. Eventually administration of Motufoua Secondary School became the sole responsibility of the Department of Education of Tuvalu.\nFetuvalu Secondary School, a day school operated by the Church of Tuvalu, is located on Funafuti. The school re-opened in 2003 having been closed for 5 years.\nIn 2011, Fusi Alofa Association Tuvalu (FAA \u2013 Tuvalu) established a school for children with special needs.\nCommunity Training Centres (CTCs) have been established within the primary schools on each atoll. The CTSs provide vocational training to students that do not progress beyond Class 8. The CTCs offer training in basic carpentry, gardening and farming, sewing and cooking. At the end of their studies the graduates of CTC can apply to continue studies either at Motufoua Secondary School or the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI). Adults can also attend courses at the CTCs.\nEducation in the 21st century.\nThe University of the South Pacific (USP) operates an Extension Centre in Funafuti. The USP organised a seminar in June 1997 for the purposes of the Tuvalu community informing USP of their requirements for future tertiary education and training, and to assist in the development of the Tuvaluan educational policy. The Government of Tuvalu, with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank, developed a draft master plan to develop the educational sector, with the draft plan being discussed at a workshop in June 2004.\nEducation in Tuvalu has been the subject of reviews including in Tuvalu-Australia Education Support Program (TAESP) reports beginning in 1997, the Westover Report (AusAID 2000), the report on Quality in Education and Training by the Ministry of Education and Sport, Tuvalu (MOES 2002), the Tuvalu Technical and Vocational Education and Training Study (NZAID 2003), the report on Tuvalu Curriculum Framework (AusAID 2003) with further development of the National Curriculum (AusAID 2004).\nThe priorities of the Education Department in 2012\u20132015 include providing the equipment for elearning at Motufoua Secondary School and setting up a multimedia unit in the department to develop and deliver content in all areas of the curriculum across all level of education.\nAtufenua Maui and educators from Japan have worked on the implementation of an e-learning pilot system at Motufoua Secondary School that applies the Modular Object Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment (Moodle). The e-learning system is intended to benefit students at Motufoua Secondary School and to provide computer skills to students who will enter the tertiary level of education outside Tuvalu.\nIn 2010, there were 1,918 students who were taught by 109 teachers (98 certified and 11 uncertified). The teacher-pupil ratio for primary schools in Tuvalu is around 1:18 for all schools with the exception of Nauti school, which has a student-teacher ratio of 1:27. Nauti School on Funafuti is the largest primary in Tuvalu with more than 900 students (45 percent of the total primary school enrolment). The pupil-teacher ratio for Tuvalu is low compared to the Pacific region, which has a ratio of 1:29.\nFour tertiary institutions offer technical and vocational courses. Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI), Tuvalu Atoll Science Technology Training Institute (TASTII), Australian Pacific Training Coalition (APTC) and University of the South Pacific (USP) Extension Centre. The services provided at the USP campus include career counselling, Student Learning Support, IT Support (Moodle, React, Computer Lab and Wi Fi) and library services (IRS).\nEducation and the national strategy plans: \"Te Kakeega III\" and \"Te Kete\".\nThe education strategy is described in \"Te Kakeega II\" (Tuvalu National Strategy for Sustainable Development 2005\u20132015) and \"Te Kakeega III \u2013 National Strategy for Sustainable Development-2016\u20132020\".\n\"Te Kakeega II\" has identified the following key objectives in regards the development of the education system: (i) Curriculum and Assessment Improvement, (ii) Increased student participation by ensuring access and equity for students with special needs, (iii) Improved quality and efficiency of management, (iv) Human Resource Development, (v) Strengthened community partnerships and develop a culture of working together.\nIn 2011 meetings were held to review \"Te Kakeega II\" and the Tuvalu Education Strategic Plan (TESP) II; Tuvalu Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) Report. In 2013 a report was published on improving the quality of education as part of the Millennium Development Goal Acceleration Framework.\n\"Te Kakeega III\" describes the education strategy as being:\nIn the national strategy plan for 2021\u20132030, the name \u201dKakeega\u201d was replaced by \u201cTe Kete\u201d which is the name of a domestic traditional basket woven from green or brown coconut leaves. Symbolically, \u201cTe Kete\u201d has biblical significance for Tuvaluan Christian traditions by referencing to the basket or the cradle that saved the life of Moses.\nHeritage and culture.\nArchitecture.\nThe traditional buildings of Tuvalu used plants and trees from the native broadleaf forest, including timber from \"pouka\" (\"Hernandia peltata\"); \"ngia\" or \"ingia\" bush (\"Pemphis acidula\"); \"miro\" (\"Thespesia populnea\"); \"tonga\" (\"Rhizophora mucronata\"); \"fau\" or \"fo fafini\", or woman's fibre tree (\"Hibiscus tiliaceus\"). Fibre is from coconut; \"ferra\", native fig (\"Ficus aspem\"); \"fala\", screw pine or \"Pandanus\". The buildings were constructed without nails and were lashed together with a plaited sennit rope that was handmade from dried coconut fibre.\nFollowing contact with Europeans, iron products were used including nails and corrugated roofing material. Modern buildings in Tuvalu are constructed from imported building materials, including imported timber and concrete.\nChurch and community buildings (\"maneapa\") are usually coated with white paint that is known as \"lase\", which is made by burning a large amount of dead coral with firewood. The whitish powder that is the result is mixed with water and painted on the buildings.\nArt of Tuvalu.\nThe women of Tuvalu use cowrie and other shells in traditional handicrafts. The artistic traditions of Tuvalu have traditionally been expressed in the design of clothing and traditional handicrafts such as the decoration of mats and fans. Crochet (\"kolose\") is one of the art forms practised by Tuvaluan women. The material culture of Tuvalu uses traditional design elements in artefacts used in everyday life such as the design of canoes and fish hooks made from traditional materials.\nTraditional uses of material from the native broadleaf forest.\nCharles Hedley (1896) identified the uses of plants and trees from the native broadleaf forest as including:\nThese plants and trees are still used in the Art of Tuvalu to make traditional artwork and handicraft. Tuvaluan women continue to make \"Te titi tao\", which is a traditional skirt made of dried pandanus leaves that are dyed using \"Tongo\" (\"Rhizophora mucronata\") and \"Nonu\" (\"Morinda citrifolia\"). The art of making a titi tao is passed down from Fafinematua (elder women) to the Tamaliki Fafine (young women) who are preparing for their first Fatele.\nTraditional fishing canoes (\"paopao\").\nThe people of Tuvalu construct traditional outrigger canoes. A 1996 survey conducted on Nanumea found some 80 canoes. In 2020 there are about 50 canoes with up to five households practicing traditional canoe building. However, the availability of mature trees (\"Calophyllum inophyllum\") on the island is declining.\nAn outrigger canoe would be constructed by a skilled woodworker ( or ) of the family, on whose land was a suitable tree. The canoe builder would call on the assistance of the of other families. The ideal shape the canoe was that of the body of a whale (), while some shaped the canoe to reflect the body of a bonito (). Before steel tools became available, the or used shell and stone adzes, which were rapidly blunted when used. With a group of up to ten building a canoe, one or two would work on the canoe, while others were engaged in sharpening the edge of one adze after another. Each morning, the would conduct a religious ceremony () over the adzes before the commencement of work. When steel tools became available, two would be sufficient to build a canoe.\nDonald Gilbert Kennedy described the construction of traditional outrigger canoes (\"paopao\") and of the variations of single-outrigger canoes that had been developed on Vaitupu and Nanumea. Gerd Koch, an anthropologist, Koch visited the atolls of Nanumaga, Nukufetau and Niutao, in 1960\u201361, and published a book on the material culture of the Ellice Islands, which also described the canoes of those islands.\nThe variations of single-outrigger canoes that had been developed on Vaitupu and Nanumea were reef-type or paddled canoe; that is, they were designed for carrying over the reef and paddled, rather than sailed. The traditional outrigger canoes from Nui were constructed with an indirect type of outrigger attachment and the hull is double-ended, with no distinct bow and stern. These canoes were designed to be sailed over the Nui lagoon. The booms of the outrigger are longer than those found in other designs of canoes from the other islands. This made the Nui canoe more stable when used with a sail than the other designs.\nDance and music.\nThe traditional music of Tuvalu consists of a number of dances, including \"fakaseasea\", \"fakanau\" and \"fatele\".\nHeritage.\nThe\u00a0\"aliki\"\u00a0were the leaders of traditional Tuvaluan society. The\u00a0\"aliki\"\u00a0had the\u00a0\"tao aliki\", or assistant chiefs who were the mediators between the islanders and the\u00a0\"aliki\", who were responsible for the administration and supervision of daily activities on the island, such as arranging fishing expeditions and communal works. The role of the sisters and daughters of the\u00a0\"aliki\"\u00a0was to ensure that the women were engaged in activities that were traditionally done by the women, such as weaving baskets, mats, baskets, string, clothing and other materials. The elders of the community were male heads of each family (\"sologa\"). Each family would have a task (\"pologa\") to perform for the community, such as being a skilled\u00a0builder of canoes or houses ( or ), or being skilled at fishing, farming, or as a warrior to defend the island. The skills of a family are passed on from parents to children.\nAn important building is the \"falekaupule\" or \"maneapa\", the traditional island meeting hall, where important matters are discussed and which is also used for wedding celebrations and community activities such as a \"fatele\" involving music, singing and dancing. \"Falekaupule\" is also used as the name of the council of elders \u2013 the traditional decision-making body on each island. Under the Falekaupule Act, \"Falekaupule\" means \"traditional assembly in each island\u00a0... composed in accordance with the Aganu of each island\". \"Aganu\" means traditional customs and culture.\nTuvalu does not have any museums, however the creation of a Tuvalu National Cultural Centre and Museum is part of the government's strategic plan for 2018\u201324.\nLand ownership.\nDonald Gilbert Kennedy, the resident District Officer in the administration of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony from 1932 to 1938, described the \"Pulaka\" pits as usually being shared between different families, with their total area providing an average of about 40 square yards (36.576 square metres) per head of population, although the area of pits varied from island to island depending on the extent of the freshwater lens that is located under each island. Kennedy also describe the land ownership as having evolved from the pre-European contact system known as \"Kaitasi\" (lit. \u201ceat-as-one\u201d), in which the land held by family groups under the control of the senior male member of the clan \u2013 a system of land based on kinship-based bonds, which changed over time to become a land ownership system where the land was held by individual owners - known as \"Vaevae\" (\u201cto divide\u201d). Under the \"Vaevae\" system, a pit may contain numerous small individual holdings with boundaries marked by small stones or with each holding divided by imaginary lines between trees on the edge of the pits. The custom of inheritance of land, and the resolution of disputes over the boundaries of holdings, land ownership and inheritance was traditionally determined by the elders of each island.\nTsunami &amp; Cyclones.\nThe low level of islands makes them very exposed to the effects of a tsunami or cyclone. Nui was struck by a giant wave on 16 February 1882; earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occurring in the basin of the Pacific Ocean \u2013 the Pacific Ring of Fire \u2013 are possible causes of a tsunami. Tuvalu experienced an average of three tropical cyclones per decade between the 1940s and 1970s, however eight occurred in the 1980s. The impact of individual cyclones is subject to variables including the force of the winds and also whether a cyclone coincides with high tides.\nGeorge Westbrook recorded a cyclone that struck Funafuti in 1883. A cyclone struck Nukulaelae on 17\u201318 March 1886. Captain Edward Davis of HMS \"Royalist\", who visited the Ellice Group in 1892, recorded in the ship's diary that in February 1891 the Ellice Group was devastated by a severe cyclone. A cyclone caused severe damage to the islands in 1894. In 1972 Cyclone Bebe caused severe damage to Funafuti. Cyclone Ofa had a major impact on Tuvalu in late January and early February 1990. During the 1996\u201397 cyclone season, Cyclone Gavin, Hina and Keli passed through the islands of Tuvalu.\nCyclone of 1883.\nGeorge Westbrook, a trader on Funafuti, recorded a cyclone that struck on 23\u201324 December 1883. At the time the cyclone struck he was the sole inhabitant of Funafuti as Tema, the Samoan missionary, had taken everyone else to Funafala to work on erecting a church. The buildings on Funafuti were destroyed, including the church and the trade stores of George Westbrook and Alfred Restieaux. Little damage had occurred at Funafala and the people returned to rebuild at Funafuti.\nCyclone Bebe 1972.\nIn 1972 Funafuti was in the path of Cyclone Bebe during the 1972\u201373 South Pacific cyclone season. Cyclone Bebe was a pre-season tropical cyclone that impacted the Gilbert, Ellice Islands, and Fiji island groups. First spotted on 20 October, the system intensified and grew in size through 22 October. At about 4 p.m. on Saturday 21 October sea water was bubbling through the coral on the airfield with the water reaching a height of about 4\u20135 feet high. Cyclone Bebe continued through Sunday 22 October. The Ellice Islands Colony's ship \"Moanaraoi\" was in the lagoon and survived, however 3 tuna boats were wrecked. Waves broke over the atoll. Five people died, two adults and a 3-month-old child were swept away by waves, and two sailors from the tuna boats were drowned. Cyclone Bebe knocked down 95% of the houses and trees. The storm surge created a wall of coral rubble along the ocean side of Funafuti and Funafala that was about long, and about thick at the bottom. The cyclone submerged Funafuti and sources of drinking water were contaminated as a result of the system's storm surge and fresh water flooding; with severe damages to houses and installations.\nCyclone Pam 2015.\nPrior to the formation of Cyclone Pam, flooding from king tides, which peaked at on 19 February 2015, caused considerable road damage across the multi-island nation of Tuvalu. Between 10 and 11 March, tidal surges estimated to be associated with the cyclone swept across the low-lying islands of Tuvalu. The atolls of Nanumea, Nanumanga, Niutao, Nui, Nukufetau, Nukulaelae, and Vaitupu were affected. Significant damage to agriculture and infrastructure occurred. The outermost islands were hardest hit, with one flooded in its entirety. A state of emergency was subsequently declared on 13 March. Water supplies on Nui were contaminated by seawater and rendered undrinkable. An estimated 45\u00a0percent of the nation's nearly 10,000\u00a0people were displaced, according to Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga.\nNew Zealand started providing aid to Tuvalu on 14 March. Owing to the severity of damage in the nation, the local chapter of the Red Cross enacted an emergency operation plan on 16 March which would focus on the needs of 3,000\u00a0people. The focus on the 81,873\u00a0CHF operation was to provide essential non-food items and shelter. Flights carrying these supplies from Fiji began on 17 March. Prime Minister Sopoaga stated that Tuvalu appeared capable of handling the disaster on its own and urged that international relief be focused on Vanuatu. Tuvalu's Disaster Coordinator, Suneo Silu, said the priority island is Nui as sources of fresh water were contaminated. On 17 March, the Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced a donation of US$61,000 in aid to Tuvalu. UNICEF and Australia also delivered aid to Tuvalu.\nAs of 22 March, 71 families (40 percent of the population) of Nui were displaced and were living in 3 evacuation centres or with other families and on Nukufetau, 76 people (13 percent of the population) were displaced and were living in 2 evacuation centres. The Situation Report published on 30 March reported that on Nukufetau all the displaced people had returned to their homes. Nui suffered the most damage of the three central islands (Nui, Nukufetau and Vaitupu); with both Nui and Nukufetau suffering the loss of 90% of the crops. Of the three northern islands (Nanumanga, Niutao, Nanumea), Nanumanga suffered the most damage, with 60\u2013100 houses flooded and damage to the health facility.\nTuvalu and climate change.\nTuvalu became the 189th member of the United Nations in September 2000, and appoints a Permanent Representative to the United Nations.\nTuvalu, one of the world's smallest countries, has indicated that its priority within the United Nations is to emphasise \"climate change and the unique vulnerabilities of Tuvalu to its adverse impacts\". Other priorities are obtaining \"additional development assistance from potential donor countries\", widening the scope of Tuvalu's bilateral diplomatic relations, and, more generally, expressing \"Tuvalu's interests and concerns\". The issue of climate change in Tuvalu has featured prominently in Tuvalu's interventions at the UN and at other international fora.\nIn 2002, Governor-General Tomasi Puapua concluded his address to the United Nations General Assembly by saying:\nAddressing the Special Session of the Security Council on Energy, Climate and Security in April 2007, Ambassador Pita stated:\nAddressing the United Nations General Assembly in September 2008, Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia stated:\nIn November 2011, Tuvalu was one of the eight founding members of Polynesian Leaders Group, a regional grouping intended to cooperate on a variety of issues including culture and language, education, responses to climate change, and trade and investment. Tuvalu participates in the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), which is a coalition of small island and low-lying coastal countries that have concerns about their vulnerability to the adverse effects of global climate change. The Sopoaga Ministry led by Enele Sopoaga made a commitment under the Majuro Declaration, which was signed on 5 September 2013, to implement power generation of 100% renewable energy (between 2013 and 2020). This commitment is proposed to be implemented using Solar PV (95% of demand) and biodiesel (5% of demand). The feasibility of wind power generation will be considered as part of the commitment to increase the use of renewable energy in Tuvalu.\nIn September 2013 Enele Sopoaga said that relocating Tuvaluans to avoid the impact of sea level rise \"should never be an option because it is self defeating in itself. For Tuvalu I think we really need to mobilise public opinion in the Pacific as well as in the [rest of] world to really talk to their lawmakers to please have some sort of moral obligation and things like that to do the right thing.\"\nMarshall Islands President Christopher Loeak presented the Majuro Declaration to the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon during General Assembly Leaders' week from 23 September 2013. The Majuro Declaration is offered as a \"Pacific gift\" to the UN Secretary-General in order to catalyze more ambitious climate action by world leaders beyond that achieved at the December 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP15). On 29 September 2013 the Deputy Prime Minister Vete Sakaio concluded his speech to the General Debate of the 68th Session of the United Nations General Assembly with an appeal to the world, \"please save Tuvalu against climate change. Save Tuvalu in order to save yourself, the world\".\nPrime Minister Enele Sopoaga said at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) that the goal for COP21 should a global temperature goal of below 1.5 degrees Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels, which is the position of the Alliance of Small Island States.\nPrime Minister Sopoaga said in his speech to the meeting of heads of state and government:\nHis speech concluded with the plea:\nEnele Sopoaga described the important outcomes of COP21 as including the stand-alone provision for assistance to small island states and some of the least developed countries for loss and damage resulting from climate change and the ambition of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century.\nIn November 2022, Simon Kofe, Minister for Justice, Communication &amp; Foreign Affairs, proclaimed that in response to rising sea levels and the perceived failures by the outside world to combat global warming, the country would be uploading itself to the metaverse in an effort to preserve itself and allow it to function as a country even in the event of it being underwater.\nOn 10 November 2023, Tuvalu signed the Falepili Union, a bilateral diplomatic relationship with Australia, under which Australia will provide a pathway for citizens of Tuvalu to migrate to Australia, to enable climate-related mobility for Tuvaluans.\nFilmography.\nDocumentary films about Tuvalu:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "56732", "revid": "915833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56732", "title": "History of Eswatini", "text": "Artifacts indicating human activity dating back to the early Stone Age have been found in the Kingdom of Eswatini. The earliest known inhabitants of the region were Khoisan hunter-gatherers. Later, the population became predominantly Nguni during and after the great Bantu migrations. People speaking languages ancestral to the current Sotho and Nguni languages began settling no later than the 11th century. The country now derives its name from a later king named Mswati II. Mswati II was the greatest of the fighting kings of Eswatini, and he greatly extended the area of the country to twice its current size. The people of Eswatini largely belong to a number of clans that can be categorized as \"Emakhandzambili\", \"Bemdzabu\", and \"Emafikamuva\", depending on when and how they settled in Eswatini.\nEarly settlements by Swazis (until 1700s).\nThe earliest known inhabitants of the region were Khoisan hunter-gatherers. They were largely replaced by the kashian hunter tribe during Bantu migrations who hailed from the Great Lakes regions of eastern and central Africa. Evidence of agriculture and iron use dates from about the 4th century and people speaking languages ancestral to current Sotho and Nguni languages began settling no later than the 11th century. The Swazi settlers, then known as \"the Ngwane\" (or \"bakaNgwane\"), before entering Swaziland had been settled on the banks of the Pongola River and prior to that in the area of the Tembe River near present-day Maputo. Dlamini III was a king or iNgwenyama of the Swazi people and he led them approximately between 1720 until 1744. Working with his senior adviser Chief Gadlela Mbokane. King Dlamini III was the father to Ngwane III the first King of modern Swaziland.\u00a0Continuing conflict with the Ndwandwe people pushed them further north, with Ngwane III establishing his capital at Shiselweni at the foot of the Mhlosheni hills. Under Sobhuza I, the Ngwane people eventually established their capital at Zombodze in the heartland of present-day Swaziland. In this process, they conquered and incorporated the long established clans of the country known to the Swazi as \"Emakhandzambili\".\nOrigins: Embo / Emalangeni and Tembe links.\nSeveral scholars emphasise that the ethnic and political formations that later became the Swazi polity emerged in the eastern Maputaland-Lubombo region and the groupings were earlier closely connected with the Tembe community and Nyaka community of the Delagoa Bay coast. \nThese coastal and interior groups are variously referred to in the literature as Embo-Nguni, Embo-Dlamini, Tsonga-Nguni or Emalangeni; over time a branch of this wider Emalangeni grouping migrated inland and contributed to the founding lines of the Ngwane/Dlamini polity that later became Eswatini.\nNineteenth-century British colonial records also linked the Tembe and Swazi chieftaincies. One document noted: \u201cWe observe that the words Kings are intended to signify the Kings of Swazi and Tembe.\u201d\nIn the 1985 Ngwavuma territorial dispute between Eswatini and South Africa, the then Chief of Tembe stated publicly that the Tembe people considered themselves \"more Swati than Zulu\", implying that they would agree to fall under Eswatini than South Africa during boundary disputes.\nConsolidation of the Swazi Nation (1740s\u20131868).\nThereafter during the leadership of Ngwane III Swazis settled present-day Swaziland.\nThese Swazis first settled north of the Pongola River. The Ngwane Kingdom was thus established during the rule of Ngwane III from around 1745\nuntil 1780. The early Swazi people emigrated from the Lubombo mountains where Swazi rulers were established, to the banks of the Pongola River.\nThe leader, Ngwane III established the Swazi settlements here near the Ndwandwe Kingdom. Swazis were in constant conflict with their\nneighbors, the Ndwandwes. The capital of Ngwane III was in Southern Swaziland in Shiselweni at the foot of the Mhlosheni Mountains near Nhlangano and Mahamba. Swazis established a polity based on Kingship accompanied by Queen Mothers and during the minority of a crown prince a Queen Regent. Thus when Ngwane died, LaYaka Ndwandwe became Queen Regent until Ndvungunye became the King. The kingship of Ndvungunye continued the order established by Ngwane III from 1780 until 1815 when he was killed by lightning. He was succeeded by Ngwane IV after the regency of Queen Regent Lomvula Mndzebele. Ngwane IV was also known as Sobhuza I and Somhlolo a revered king of Swaziland. Sobhuza continued to expand the territory of Swaziland.\nThe conflict of Swaziland and the Ndwandwe kingdom led Somhlolo (also known as Sobhuza I and Ngwane IV) to move his capital from Zombodze in Shiselweni to the centre of Swaziland at another kraal called Zombodze. Somhlolo who became king in 1815 consolidated the order of the Ngwane state by incorporating the \"Emakhandzambili\" clans into his kingdom adding to the \"Bemdzabuko\" or \"true Swazi\". Somhlolo was a strategic leader between 1815 and 1839 a period including the Mfecane period of Shaka Zulu a Zulu illegitimate child of Senzangakhona who created his kingdom from the\nMtetwa polity established by Dingiswayo. Sobhuza used his diplomatic skills to avoid conflict with Shaka by allying with him when it suited him. As a\nresult, Swaziland was left unaffected by the Mfecane wars. Somhlolo was succeeded in 1839 by his son Mswati II who is known as the greatest of the Swazi fighting kings.\nMswati inherited an area which extended as far as present-day Barberton in the north and included the Nomahasha district in the Portuguese territory of Mozambique. Mswati continued to expand Swazi territory and the clans added to the\nnation were considered \"Emafikamuva\". During his reign, the territory of Swaziland was expanded northward and his capital was at Hhohho in the northern part of Swaziland. Mswati improved the military organisation of the regiments in Swaziland. His regiment was Inyatsi and he danced the sacred incwala at Hhohho instead of the common Ezulwini valley as his predecessors. Mswati was a powerful king who attacked other African tribes to acquire cattle and captives. Within Swaziland, his force was used to limit the power of the \"Emakhandzambili\" chiefs. Mswati made land grants in 1855 to the Lydenburg Republic though the wording of the sale is vague. The Boers at the time were fairly weak and could not act upon the land concession. Mswati continued to fight with other African tribes across the land and beyond in areas such as Zoutpansberg and Ohrigstad. His death in 1865 brought about an end to the conquest by the Swazi kings. Mswati was succeeded by Ludvonga, however, he died in his youth and as a result Mbandzeni was chosen by the Swazis National Council instead, and King Mbandzeni appointed Chief Manzini Mbokane as one of his leading tribal advisors. Chief Manzini Mbokane was a father of Ntengu Mbokane, and Chief Mbokane was the leader of the King's Advisory Council, which was later called Liqoqo.\nSettlements and concessionaires (1868\u20131899).\nThe autonomy of the Emaswati was influenced by British and Dutch rule of Southern Africa in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1881 the British government signed a convention recognising Swazi independence. However, in 1894, a convention placed Swaziland under the South African Republic as a protectorate.\nSwazi contact with European peoples began when Dutch Trekboers reached the western hinterland of Swaziland in the 1840s.\nBy 1845 about 300 Boer families had settled in Ohristad with more families in Lydenburg. Two deeds of sale dated 1846 and 1855 indicate the sale of Swazi territory to the Dutch republics for a sum of 170 cattle. These deeds at face value seemed to surrender the whole of the\nSwazi territory to the Dutch. Following the death of King Mswati II in 1865, a period of regency followed with Queen Regent\nTsandzile Ndwandwe until 1875. The South African Republic in 1868 attempted to annex Swaziland by a proclamation. Mbandzeni, following the death of his half brother, the crown prince Ludvonga in 1872, was chosen by inkhosikati LaMgadlela Khumalo as her adopted son and hence a crown prince. However threats existed from prince Mbilini who had married one of Ntengu Mbokane's daughters, and Mbandzeni's half brother and one of the sons of Mswati who was a pretender to the throne and allied with the Zulu\nKing Cetshwayo. However, he never became successful. The British prevented any attacks from Cetshwayo, who had been crowned by Sir Theophilus Shepstone in 1873. In addition, the Transvaal Boers wanted to assert their authority over Swaziland by supporting Mbandzeni. Indeed, in Mbandzeni's coronation Rudolf, the Resident Magistrate of Ladysmith and former landdrost of Utrecht in the company of about 350 burghers and 70 wagons, attended the ceremony. During this period, Britain annexed the Transvaal (1877 to 1881). In 1879, the same year as the Zulu war, Mbandzeni aided the British who were now controlling the Transvaal to defeat Sekhukhune and to dismantle his kingdom. In return for his assistance, Swaziland's independence was to be guaranteed perpetually and Swaziland would be protected from Boer and Zulu encroachment.\nIn 1881 the Pretoria Convention established nominal British suzerainty over the re-established Transvaal State; article 24 guaranteed the independence of Swaziland, its boundary and Swazi people in their country as recognised by both Britain and the Transvaal. Under this convention, the Swazi territory was reduced in size, leaving Swazi people as residents of the Transvaal territory in present-day Mpumalanga province in South Africa. The London Convention of 1884's article XII continued to recognise Swaziland as an independent country with Mbandzeni as its King. However, in the years between 1885 and 1889, as more concessions were granted, the population of\nEuropeans in Swaziland increased. Unease with some concessionaires led to Mbandzeni to request British intervention. In addition to this, Boer encroachments, especially in 1887, increased the intensity of these requests. The situation in the country continued to deteriorate as some raids, cattle rustling and stealing of children from Swazi villages by Boers continued. Britain refused intervention on the grounds that there was presence of European residents not of British extraction and concessions held at the time by the South African Republic in areas such as tax collection, postal services which should be in the control of a State government.\nOn 18 December 1889 after Mbandzeni's death, the Swazi Government, represented by the Queen Regent Tibati Nkambule and the Swazi Council made a proclamation appointing Sir Theophilus Shepstone, Chief Ntengu Mbokane and two other officers representing the South African Republic and Britain and a provisional council to oversee administration of the country especially concession and affairs of European residents of the country. A concessions court was established to see which concessions were valid and which were dubious.\nThe organic proclamation was followed by the London convention of 1894 which settled the matter over Swaziland. The Swazi proclamation supporting this convention was resisted for a while since its proposal in 1893 and was signed by the Queen Regent and Swazi Council in December 1894. In this convention, the status of Swaziland, its people and the Kings were recognised as in the 1884 convention. However, for the administrative affairs of Swaziland it would be a protected state of the Transvaal republic with guarantees on the rights of Swazi people in their country and their system of governance. This administration, led by Krogh, went on until the Anglo Boer War started in 1899. Ngwane V who had been chosen as crown prince following Mbandzeni's death in 1889 was crowned in 1895 after the London Convention. In 1898 he was allegedly responsible for the death of his advisors Mbaba Nsibandze, Chief Mbokane and two of his aides. In response, he was charged with the crime and during this time he fled to British Zululand, returning on guaranteed for his safety. On his return he was charged with a lesser crime of public disturbance and was fined 500 pounds. In addition, his judicial powers were reduced. The following year, in October 1899, the Anglo Boer War began. This led to the discontinuity of Transvaal administration of Swaziland's affairs. Ingwenyama Ngwane V, however, ruled until December of that year, when he died while dancing the sacred incwala.\nAnglo-Boer War (1899\u20131902).\nSwaziland was indirectly involved in the Second Boer War (1899\u20131902). The beginning of the conflict found it administered by the South African Republic, with the colonial headquarters set at Bremersdorp. In September 1899, with war considered imminent, the colonists started evacuating the area. Ngwane V of Swaziland (Bhunu) was informed that the area would be left in his care during the absence of the White residents. The Swaziland Police under Sgt Opperman started practicing for war while issuing rifles and ammunition to remaining burghers. On 4 October 1899, Special Commissioner Krogh issued an official notice of evacuation for \"all White inhabitants\" with the exception of burghers eligible for active service. Most of the British subjects were escorted towards the border with Mozambique, women and other South African civilians were left heading for various destinations. People with dual nationality were still subject to the draft, though unwilling to fight against their own people. Several of them escaped towards Mozambique or the Colony of Natal.\nIt was not long before skirmishes involved the Swaziland forces. On 28 October 1899, the newly formed Swaziland Commando unit moved against a British police post at Kwaliweni. The South African unit counted about 200 burghers, while the outpost only had 20 men. Bhunu managed to warn the police post of the approaching attack. The police retreated towards Ingwavuma, the seat of a magistrate. The Commandos burned the abandoned post and a nearby shop to the ground. Then Joaquim Ferreira led them towards Ingwavuma. The village was not better guarded and had to also be evacuated. The Swaziland Commando burned it to the ground, while the magistrate and his people escaped to Nongoma.\nMeanwhile, the Swazi people had been warned by Piet Joubert to remain calm and not involve themselves in the conflict. Bhunu instead found himself unrestricted from colonial authorities for the first time. He soon felt free to settle old scores with political enemies. News of the violent deaths of diplomat Mnkonkoni Kunene and several others in time reached the Boer forces involved in the Siege of Ladysmith. Several of the dead had close ties to the colonial authorities. Joubert had to assure worried commanders that Swaziland was not turning against them. Indeed, spies reported that Bhunu feared he had been bewitched. He was striking against whomever he suspected of the deed. On 10 December 1899, Bhunu died due to a serious illness. He had blamed it on sorcery, though contemporaries suspect it was alcohol-induced. His mother Labotsibeni Mdluli became regent. She set about eliminating the surviving advisors and favourites of Bhunu.\nSwazi regiments were roaming the country during the internal conflicts. The South African authorities were worried that the violence could expand towards the south-western border of Swaziland, where Boer farms were cultivated by women and children. They had the farms evacuated and the population transferred to Piet Retief. The farmers from Piet Retief, Wakkerstroom and their vicinities had made a practice of trekking their sheep into Swaziland for winter grazing. In January 1900, Francis William Reitz, the State Secretary of the South African Republic, started issuing orders discouraging any sheep-herders from entering Swaziland. On 18 April 1900, any such entry was forbidden. The Swaziland Commando were by that point far from their initial home base, fighting along the Tugela River.\nThe British had their own concerns about Swaziland. They suspected that supplies from Mozambique could be smuggled to the Boers through Swaziland. Queen-regent Labotsibeni was however attempting to maintain neutrality in the wider conflict, pre-occupied with securing the throne. Her grandson Sobhuza II of Swaziland was underage and there were other viable candidates for the throne among the House of Dlamini, in particular Prince Masumphe. Masumphe was a cousin of Bhunu and had been a rival candidate for the throne since 1889. His line of the family maintained close relations with the Boers, the Prince himself having been educated at Pretoria. By May, 1900, the Queen was worried that the Boers would intervene against her in case of a succession dispute. She opened communications with the restored magistrate of Ingwavuma, arranging to flee to his area if needed.\nHer messages were passed to the government of Natal and from there to Cape Town, the capital of the Cape Colony. A reply by Johannes Smuts assured her that the British had not forgotten about the Swazi and British representatives would reliably return to Swaziland at an early date. The message might have reflected Smuts' own ambitions but his authority on such matters was rather questionable. But Frederick Roberts, Baron Roberts, a high-ranking military officer, was also convinced to start diplomatic contacts with the Queen. His representatives were to persuade the queen-regent of three things: first, the need to prevent the Boers from occupying the mountains of the area; secondly, the necessity of formally appealing for British protection; and third, to make clear that the indiscriminate murders in Swaziland would have to end.\nThe British contacts with the Swazi played a role in advance of their siege of Komatipoort, a nearby South African stronghold. In September 1900, once the town fell, the British were able to capture Barberton and its area. A number of Boers fled into Swaziland, only to have the Swazi disarm them and confiscate their cattle. The end of South African presence in the area left open the question of what to do with Swaziland. Smuts had been campaigning since May to convince the British authorities to place Swaziland under their administration. By September, Smuts had gained some support from civil authorities but not from military ones, since Roberts did not want to devote any of his forces to an invasion or occupation of the area. Nevertheless, Smuts attempted some diplomatic contacts with the Swazi, which were not particularly successful. The individual Smuts met for discussions refused to give any information on the internal affairs of Swaziland or Boer activities.\nThe fall of Komatipoort directly resulted in increased importance of Swaziland for the Boers. To maintain their communications with diplomatic and trade contacts in Louren\u00e7o Marques, Mozambique, the Boers had to send messengers through Swaziland. This was difficult since British forces were allowed to pass through certain Swazi areas. By November 1900, the Queen was able to assure both Roberts and Smuts that she \"was doing her best to drive Boers out of her country.\" A few armed burghers and their African allies, hostile to her government, were still active at times.\nOn 29 November 1900, Roberts was relieved of his command. His replacement was Herbert Kitchener, Baron Kitchener of Khartoum. By late December, Smuts contacted the military secretary office of Kitchener concerning the Swaziland situation. Smuts had secured the position of Resident Commissioner of Swaziland, though the British had no actual authority over the area. He attempted to convince Kitchener it was time to establish a permanent military presence in Swaziland and put Smuts in charge of the area. Kitchener had a different view. Starting his own correspondence with Labotsibeni, Kitchener insisted on three points: first, the Swazi were still required to not take part in the war; second, no British forces would be sent into Swaziland unless the area faced a Boer invasion; and third, the Swazis were now directly under the authority of the British Crown, owing their loyalty to Victoria of the United Kingdom.\nIn December 1900 \u2013 January 1901, there were reports that retreating Boers were attempting to flee through Swaziland. Eight British columns were sent to either force the Boer commandos to surrender or flee to Swaziland. A certain column under Horace Smith-Dorrien proceeded all the way to the Swaziland border, managing to capture several Boer wagons and large numbers of cattle and sheep on 9 February 1901. Most of the captured Boers were sent to the concentration camp of Volksrust. On 11 February, another column under Edmund Allenby was positioned at the southern border of Swaziland. On 14 February, Smith-Dorrien's forces reached Amsterdam. There he was contacted by envoys of the Queen-regent, requesting aid in driving the Boers off her land. In response, the Imperial Light Horse and the Suffolk Regiment were sent into Swaziland.\nJoined by armed Swazis, the two regiments were able to capture about 30 Boers in an initial skirmish. However heavy rains soon slowed their advance through the country. On 28 February 1901, 200 other men of the British mounted infantry entered Swaziland. Under Lt. Col. Henry, this force managed to locate and capture the transport convoy of the Piet Retief Commandos. About 65 Boers were captured in the operation. The remnants of the Commandos retreated towards the southern border of Swaziland, only to be captured by the British forces stationed there. By early March, Smith-Dorrien noted that the Swazis were pillaging Boer residences. By this time, Allenby had reached Mahamba and set up camp there, Henry was pursuing another Boer wagon convoy and Queen-regent Labotsibeni was ordering her Impis to clear their land from the Boers. Henry eventually managed to return to Derby with several prisoners, while Allenby and his forces reached the vicinity of Hlatikulu. The burghers had to limit themselves to \"the hills of southwestern Swaziland\".\nSurviving accounts from the Devonshire Regiment indicate that the Swazis were acting as \"a ninth column, commanded by the Queen of the Swazis.\" On 8 March 1901, remnants of the Piet Retief Commandos, accompanied by women and children, were attacked by forces supposedly under Chief Ntshingila Simelano. The latter consisted of about 40 men, including two riflemen. Thirteen Burghers and one African guide were killed, several wounded, and the others were scattered. Some of the survivors later surrendered to the 18th Hussars. Ntshingila later denied any involvement in the massacre. In any case, the incident terrified several other Boers. Between 8 and 11 March, about 70 burghers and various women and children chose to surrender to Allenby rather than face the Swazis. The British nevertheless warned Labotsibeni to cease further massacres.\nOn 11 April 1901, Louis Botha corresponded with Kitchener, complaining that British officers were inducing the Swazis to fight against the Boers. Claiming the result was the indiscriminate murders of Burghers, women and children by Swazi commandos. Allenby attributed the killings partly to Swazi anxiety to counter Boer incursions into their territory and partly to their fear of Boer reprisals. That is what the Boers would do when the British eventually left. Allenby himself refused to allow large numbers of armed Swazis to join his column, though he still used a few of them as guides. Smuts finally entered Swaziland during this month, though unable to establish his authority over any British forces.\nThe presence of regular British troops allowed the queen-regent to present to them her concerns over an irregular unit, \"Steinaecker's Horse.\" Created early in the war as a unit of adventurers and mercenaries under British command, they were well known for looting Boer property. With the Boer increasingly impoverished, however, they had turned their attention to the cattle of the Swazi. Labotsibeni complained to both sides that this unit consisted of common robbers occupying Bremersdorp. Botha responded by sending a Commando unit against the Horse, with orders to avoid antagonizing the Swazi in any way. The Swazi National Council agreed to let them pass. Between 21 and 23 July 1901, the Ermelo Commandos succeeded in forcing most of the \"Steinaecker's Horse\" forces to retreat, capturing about 35 men, killing or wounding a few and burning Bremersdorp to the ground.\nBoth the British and the Boers continued to have access to Swaziland with occasional skirmishes occurring. On 8 November 1901, for example, the 13th Hussars captured 14 burghers near Mahamba. The skirmishes ended in February 1902 with the defeat of the final Boer unit in Swaziland.\nIn 1903, following the British victory in the Anglo-Boer war, Swaziland became a British protectorate. Much of its early administration (for example, postal services) was carried out from South Africa until 1906 when the Transvaal colony was granted self-government. Eswatini regained independence on 6 September 1968 and became the Kingdom of Swaziland. Sobhuza II, the king at independence, had become Ingwenyama in 1899 after the death of his father Ngwane V. His official coronation had taken place in December 1921 following the regency of Labotsibeni, after which he had led an unsuccessful deputation to the Privy council in London in 1922 regarding the issue of land.\nSwaziland Protectorate (1903\u20131968).\nThroughout the protectorate period from 1903 to 1968, Swaziland was largely governed by a resident commissioner who ruled according to decrees issued by the British High Commissioner to South Africa. Such decrees were formulated in close consultation with the resident commissioners, who in turn took informal and formal advice from White settler interests and the Swazi king. In 1907, during the residency of Robert Coryndon, Swazi land was partitioned into a third for the Swazi nation, or reserves, and the remaining two-thirds as crown and commercial land, for European occupation. The partition was carried out in 1909, and Swazis living in European areas were given five years to vacate the land.\nBritish Resident Commissioners in Swaziland.\nSources:\nIn 1921, the British established Swaziland's first legislative body \u2014 a European Advisory Council (EAC) of elected White representatives with the task of advising the British Resident Commissioner on non-Swazi affairs. In 1944, the Commissioner reconstituted the basis and role of the EAC, and, over Swazi objections, issued a Native Authorities Proclamation constituting the paramount chief or Ingwenyama and King to the Swazis, as the British called the king, as the native authority for the territory to issue legally enforceable orders to the Swazis, subject to restrictions and directions from the resident commissioner. Under pressure from royal non-cooperation, this proclamation was revised in 1952 to grant the Swazi paramount chief a degree of autonomy unprecedented in British indirect rule in Africa. Also in 1921, after more than twenty years of the regency headed by Queen Regent Labotsibeni, Sobhuza II became \"Ingwenyama\" (lion) or head of the Swazi nation.\nIn the early years of indirect rule, the British expected that Swaziland would eventually be incorporated into South Africa. After the Second World War, however, South Africa's intensification of racial discrimination, especially through the election of the National Party, induced the United Kingdom to prepare Swaziland for complete independence. Political activity intensified in the early 1960s. Several political parties were formed and jostled for power and economic development. However, the parties were largely urban and had few ties to the rural areas, where most Swazis still lived. The traditional Swazi leaders, including King Sobhuza II and his Inner Council, formed the Imbokodvo National Movement (INM), a political group that capitalized on its close identification with the Swazi way of life. Responding to pressure for political change, the protectorate government scheduled an election in mid-1964 for the first Legislative Council in which the Swazis would participate. In the election, the INM and four other parties, most having more radical platforms, competed in the election. The INM won all 24 elective seats.\nSwazi soldiers served in World War II (see Eswatini in World War II).\nIndependence (1968\u20131980s).\nLeading up to independence, the INM had solidified its political base. Having done this, the INM incorporated many demands of the more radical parties, especially that of immediate independence. In 1966, the UK Government agreed to discuss a new constitution. A constitutional committee agreed on a constitutional monarchy for Swaziland, with self-government to follow parliamentary elections in 1967. Swaziland became independent on 6 September 1968. Swaziland's first post-independence elections were held in May 1972. The INM received close to 75% of the vote. The Ngwane National Liberatory Congress (NNLC) received slightly more than 20% of the vote which gained the party three seats in parliament.\nIn response to the NNLC's showing, King Sobhuza repealed the 1968 constitution on 12 April 1973 and dissolved parliament. He assumed all powers of government and prohibited all political activities and trade unions from operating. He justified his actions as having removed alien and divisive political practices incompatible with the Swazi way of life. In January 1979, a new parliament was convened, chosen partly through indirect elections and partly through direct appointment by the king.\nKing Sobhuza II died in August 1982, and Queen Regent Dzeliwe assumed the duties of the head of state. In 1984, an internal dispute led to the replacement of the prime minister and eventual replacement of Dzeliwe by a new Queen Regent Ntombi. Ntombi's only child, Prince Makhosetive, was named heir to the Swazi throne. Real power at this time was concentrated in the Liqoqo, a supreme traditional advisory body that claimed to give binding advice to the Queen Regent. In October 1985, Queen Regent Ntombi demonstrated her power by dismissing the leading figures of the Liqoqo. Prince Makhosetive returned from school in England to ascend to the throne and help end the continuing internal disputes. He was enthroned as Ingwenyama Mswati III on 25 April 1986. Shortly afterwards he abolished the Liqoqo. In November 1987, a new parliament was elected and a new cabinet appointed.\nRecent history (1980s and 1990s).\nMswati III is the present monarch of Swaziland since his coronation in 1986, and rules together with Queen Mother Ntombi Tfwala. In 1986 Sotsha Dlamini was appointed prime minister, taking over from Prince Bhekimpi. In 1987, following a premature dissolution of parliament by the king, Swaziland held its third parliamentary election under the tinkhundla traditional system. In 1988 and 1989, an underground political party, the People's United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO), criticized the king and his government, calling for 'democratic reforms'. In response to this political threat and to growing popular calls for greater accountability within government, the king and the prime minister initiated an ongoing national debate on the constitutional and political future of Swaziland. This debate produced a handful of political reforms, approved by the king, including direct and indirect voting, in the 1993 national elections. In this election, voters were registered, the constituencies were increased from 50 to 55 and the election was judged as free and fair.\nThe economy and the population of Swaziland continued to grow in the 1980s. The average economic growth was 3.3% annual growth between 1985 and 1993. Annual population growth was at approximately 3% during the same period. Swaziland's 1980s economy continued to be dependent on South Africa, with 90% of imports coming from South Africa and 37% of exports going to South Africa. Swaziland, along with Lesotho, Botswana and South Africa continued to be members of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). State revenues were heavily dependent on the Customs Union's remittances which were between 48.3% and 67.1% between 1981 and 1987.\nThe 1990s saw a rise in student and labor protests pressuring the king to introduce reforms. Thus, progress toward constitutional reforms began, culminating with the introduction of the current Swaziland constitution in 2005. This happened despite objections by political activists. The current constitution does not clearly deal with the status of political parties. The first election under the new constitution took place in 2008. Members of parliament were elected from 55 constituencies (also known as tinkhundla). These MPs served five-year terms which ended in 2013. In 2011, Swaziland suffered an economic crisis, due to reduced SACU receipts. This led to the government of Swaziland to request a loan from neighbouring South Africa. However, the Swazi government did not agree with the conditions of the loan, which included political reforms. During this period, there was increased pressure on the Swaziland government to carry out more reforms. Public protests by civic organizations and trade unions became more common. Improvements in SACU receipts from 2012 onwards, eased the fiscal pressure on the Swazi government. The new parliament, the second since promulgation of the constitution, was elected on 20 September 2013. This saw the reappointment of Sibusiso Dlamini, by the king, as prime minister for the third time.\nIn 1989, Sotja Dlamini was dismissed from his position as prime minister on 12 July 1989 and was replaced with a former Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU) secretary-general, Obed Dlamini. He was to be the premier until 1993 and succeeded by Prince Mbilini. During the tenure of both Obed and Mbilini there was growing labor militancy which culminated in a major general strike in 1997 led by the SFTU. Following the labor action, Prince Mbilini was replaced as prime minister by Sibusiso Dlamini.\nThe constitution for independent Swaziland was promulgated by Britain in November 1963 under the terms of which legislative and executive councils were established. This development was opposed by the Swazi National Council (Liqoqo). Despite such opposition, elections took place and the first Legislative Council of Swaziland was constituted on 9 September 1964. Changes to the original constitution proposed by the Legislative Council were accepted by Britain and a new constitution providing for a House of Assembly and Senate was drawn up. Elections under this constitution were held in 1967. Following the elections of 1973, the constitution of Swaziland was suspended by King Sobhuza II who thereafter ruled the country by decree until his death in 1982. At this point Sobhuza II had ruled Eswatini for 83 years, making him the longest ruling monarch in history. A regency followed his death, with Queen Regent Dzeliwe Shongwe being head of state until 1984 when she was removed by Liqoqo and replaced by Queen Mother Ntombi Twala. Mswati III, the son of Ntombi, was crowned king on 25 April 1986 as King and \"Ingwenyama\" of Eswatini. In 2018, during the 50th independence day celebration, the king announced the official renaming of the country from the Anglicized Swaziland to its Siswati form \"Eswatini\". Following this, many governmental and non-governmental bodies, corporations and international organizations changed all mention of Swaziland to Eswatini.\nOn 19 April 2018, King Mswati III announced that the Kingdom of Swaziland had renamed itself the Kingdom of Eswatini to mark the 50th anniversary of Swazi independence. The new name, Eswatini, means \"land of the Swazis\" in the Swazi language, and was partially intended to prevent confusion with the similarly named Switzerland."}

It is located in the east-central part of Africa, lying a few degrees south of the Equator in the Great Rift Valley of East Africa, where the African Great Lakes and Southeast Africa converge. It is bordered by Uganda to the north, Tanzania to the east, Burundi to the south, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west. The country\u2019s terrain consists largely of rolling hills, high mountains, and numerous lakes, with Kigali, the capital and largest city, situated near its geographic centre.\nKnown as the \"Land of a Thousand Hills\", Rwanda\u2019s high elevation gives it a temperate tropical highland climate. Its location within the Great Rift Valley contributes to a diverse landscape that includes volcanoes, savannas, and freshwater lakes.\nGeography.\nLocation and region.\nDistance to oceans.\n\"Approximate great-circle distance from centroid 2\u00b0S 30\u00b0E\" \nTerrain.\nRwanda\u2019s terrain is predominantly mountainous and hilly, with savanna areas in the east and many lakes across the country. The landscape forms part of the Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East African Rift. \nElevation extremes.\nRwanda\u2019s topography ranges from low-lying river valleys to high volcanic peaks. \nNatural resources and land use.\nRwanda\u2019s natural resource base and land use patterns are shaped by its geology, topography, and predominantly agricultural landscape.\nNatural resources.\nKey natural resources include:\nLand use.\n\"Based on 2022 estimates\"\nTotal renewable water resources: (2022 est.)\nClimate and environment.\nRwanda\u2019s climate and environmental conditions are influenced by its high elevation, varied terrain, and equatorial location.\nClimate type.\nTemperate tropical highland \nNatural hazards.\nVolcanism (notably in the Virunga Mountains) and periodic droughts\nEnvironmental issues.\nKey challenges include: \nEnvironmental treaties and conventions.\nRwanda is a party to several international environmental agreements, including:\nMajor geographic features.\nThe watershed between the major Congo and Nile drainage basins runs from north to south through Rwanda, with around 80 percent of the country's area draining into the Nile and 20 percent into the Congo via the Rusizi River. The country's longest river is the Nyabarongo, which rises in the south-west, flows north, east, and southeast before merging with the Akanyaru to form the Kagera; the Kagera then flows due north along the eastern border with Tanzania. The Nyabarongo-Kagera eventually drains into Lake Victoria, and its source in Nyungwe Forest is a contender for the as-yet undetermined overall source of the Nile.\nRwanda has many lakes, the largest being Lake Kivu. This lake occupies the floor of the Albertine Rift along most of the length of Rwanda's western border, and with a maximum depth of , it is one of the twenty deepest lakes in the world. Other sizeable lakes include Burera, Ruhondo, Muhazi, Rweru, and Ihema, the last being the largest of a string of lakes in the eastern plains of Akagera National Park.\nMountains dominate central and western Rwanda. These mountains are part of the Albertine Rift Mountains that flank the Albertine branch of the East African Rift. This branch runs from north to south along Rwanda's western border. The highest peaks are found in the Virunga volcano chain in the northwest; this includes Mount Karisimbi, Rwanda's highest point, at .\nThis western section of Rwanda, which lies within the Albertine Rift montane forests ecoregion, has an elevation of . The centre of the country is predominantly rolling hills, while the eastern border region consists of savanna, plains and swamps.\nRwanda has a temperate tropical highland climate, with lower temperatures than are typical for equatorial countries due to its high elevation. Kigali, in the centre of the country, has a typical daily temperature range between , with little variation through the year. There are some temperature variations across the country; the mountainous west and north are generally cooler than the lower-lying east.\nThere are two rainy seasons in the year. The first runs from February to June and the second from September to December. These are separated by two dry seasons: the major one from June to September, during which there is often no rain at all, and a shorter and less severe one from December to February. Rainfall varies geographically, with the west and northwest of the country receiving more precipitation annually than the east and southeast.\nPolitical geography.\nRwanda is a landlocked country in East Africa. It shares borders with Uganda to the north (), Tanzania to the east (), Burundi to the south (), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west ().\nAdministratively, Rwanda is divided into four provinces (\"intara\"): the Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western, together with the City of Kigali, which serves as both the national capital and an independent administrative entity. These provinces and the city are subdivided into districts (\"akarere\"), which serve as the main level of local government.\nRwanda shares strong cross-border trade and transport links with its neighbours. Key regional infrastructure routes include the Central Corridor, which connects Rwanda through Tanzania to the port of Dar es Salaam, and the Northern Corridor, linking the country via Uganda and Kenya to the port of Mombasa. These routes connect Rwanda to regional and international markets and support its economic integration within the East African Community (EAC).\nPhysical geography.\nRwanda is situated in East-Central Africa. The country covers an area of about , of which roughly 6 percent is water. The country lies entirely within the Nile Basin and the Congo Basin, separated by a watershed that runs north\u2013south across the western part of the country. This divide gives Rwanda its nickname, the \"land of a thousand hills.\"\nThe terrain is dominated by mountains in the west and highlands across the centre, which gradually slope downward to plains and savanna in the east. The western border follows the Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East African Rift, where steep mountains descend to Lake Kivu. This area includes the Virunga Mountains, a volcanic range that contains Mount Karisimbi, the highest point in Rwanda at . The lowest point is the Rusizi River on the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at above sea level.\nMajor rivers include the Nyabarongo River, which flows northward and then southward into the Akagera River, forming part of the upper Nile River system. Lakes are scattered throughout the country, the largest being Lake Kivu on the western frontier, while Lakes Burera and Ruhondo lie in the north. The eastern region contains a network of smaller lakes and marshlands, including the Akagera National Park wetlands.\nSoils in Rwanda are largely volcanic and fertile, supporting intensive subsistence agriculture. However, the combination of steep slopes and heavy rainfall contributes to soil erosion and land degradation. \nClimate.\nRwanda has a tropical savanna climate and a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Aw\" and \"Cwb/Cfb\"), influenced by its elevation and proximity to the equator. The country experiences moderate temperatures throughout the year, with significant regional variation between the high mountains in the west and northwest and the lower, warmer plains in the east.\nAverage daytime temperatures in Kigali range between and , while night-time temperatures remain around . Cooler conditions prevail in the highlands of the Northern Province and the Western Province near the Volcanoes National Park.\nRwanda has two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year. \nRainfall is generally heaviest in the western and northern regions and decreases toward the east and southeast. Annual precipitation in Kigali averages about , though totals can exceed in mountainous zones. \nAverage humidity in Kigali remains between 70 and 90 percent depending on the season. \nRainfall variability, especially during El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a years, continues to influence agriculture, water availability, and flood risk. \nEnvironment.\nRwanda\u2019s environment is shaped by its highland geography and dense population, both of which put pressure on natural resources. The country\u2019s ecosystems include mountain forests, savannas, and wetlands, which together support rich biodiversity despite the small national territory.\nNatural hazards.\nNatural hazards in Rwanda include periodic droughts and floods, particularly during the rainy seasons, as well as volcanic activity in the Virunga Mountains in the northwest, along the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The most active volcano is Mount Nyiragongo, which poses a regional risk of lava flows and gas emissions.\nEnvironmental issues.\nMajor environmental challenges include deforestation for fuel and agriculture, soil erosion, overgrazing, wetland degradation, and loss of biodiversity. Rwanda\u2019s growing population has intensified land use, contributing to soil exhaustion and pressure on arable land. The government has responded with large-scale reforestation, terracing, and wetland restoration programs, including the rehabilitation of the Nyandungu Urban Wetland Eco-Park in Kigali.\nConservation and climate policy.\nRwanda has established strict environmental protection policies under the Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA) and the Green Growth and Climate Resilience Strategy adopted in 2011. The country has banned plastic bags, promoted renewable energy use, and introduced policies for sustainable land and water management.\nInternational agreements.\nRwanda is a party to the following international agreements:\nRwanda has signed, but not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nExtreme points.\nThis is a list of the extreme points of Rwanda, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

By the 11th century, the inhabitants had organized into a number of kingdoms. In the 19th century, \"Mwami\" (king) Rwabugiri of the Kingdom of Rwanda conducted a decades-long process of military conquest and administrative consolidation that resulted in the kingdom coming to control most of what is now Rwanda. The colonial powers, Germany and Belgium, allied with the Rwandan court.\nA convergence of anti-colonial, and anti-Tutsi sentiment resulted in Belgium granting national independence in 1962. Direct elections resulted in a representative government dominated by the majority Hutu under President Gr\u00e9goire Kayibanda. Unsettled ethnic and political tensions were worsened when Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana, who was also Hutu, seized power in 1973. In 1990, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a rebel group composed of 10,000 Tutsi refugees from previous decades of unrest, invaded the country, starting the Rwandan Civil War. The war ground on, worsening ethnic tensions, as the Hutu feared losing their gains.\nThe assassination of Habyarimana was the catalyst for the eruption of the 1994 genocide, in which hundreds of thousands of Tutsis and some moderate Hutus were killed, including the prime minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana. The Tutsi RPF conquered Rwanda, and thousands of Hutu were imprisoned pending the establishment of the Gacaca courts. Millions of Hutu fled as refugees, contributing to large refugee camps of Hutu in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo, where there were already refugees from other countries. These were disbanded by an RPF-sponsored invasion in 1996 that replaced the new Congolese president as the result of the First Congo War. A second invasion to replace the new Congolese president initiated the Second Congo War, the deadliest war since World War II and one involving many African nations including Rwanda for many years to come.\nNeolithic to the Middle Ages.\nThe territory of present-day Rwanda has been green and fertile for many thousands of years, even during the last ice age, when part of Nyungwe Forest was fed by the alpine ice sheets of the Rwenzoris. It is not known when the country was first inhabited, but it is thought that humans moved into the area shortly after that ice age, either in the Neolithic period, around ten thousand years ago, or in the long humid period which followed, up to around 3000 BC. The earliest inhabitants of the region are generally thought to have been the Twa, a group of Pygmy forest hunters and gatherers, whose descendants still live in Rwanda today.\nArchaeological excavations conducted from the 1950s onwards have revealed evidence of sparse settlement by hunter gatherers in the late Stone Age, followed by a larger population of early Iron Age settlers. These later groups were found to have manufactured artifacts, including a type of dimpled pottery, iron tools and implements.\nCentral Sudanic speaking farmers and herders were settled in northern and western Rwanda (as well as western burundi) by 3,000BC. After them came the Sog Eastern Sudanic Agro-pastoralists (related to the Kuliak languages), who settled in areas to the south of Rwanda and to the east and west of the Ruzizi River in 2,000BC. In 1,000BC, Mashariki Bantu arrived on the western borderlines of Rwanda in the Kivu rift valley. Tale southern Cushitic pastoralists settled parts of eastern Rwanda sometime before 800BC. The descendants of the Mashariki Bantu, the Proto-Great Lakes Bantu peoples (the ancestors of the Rwanda-Rundi speakers) settled between Lake Kivu and Lake Rweru in 500BC. The Great Lakes Bantu peoples eventually assimilated all of their Nilo-Saharan and South Cushitic neighbors in Rwanda, making the land entirely Bantu-speaking.\nHundreds of years ago, the Twa were partially supplanted by the immigration of a Bantu group, the ancestors of the agriculturalist ethnic group, today known as the Hutus. The Hutu began to clear forests for their permanent settlements. The exact nature of the third major immigration, that of a predominantly pastoralist people known as Tutsi, is highly contested.\nMiddle ages.\nBy the 15th century, many of the Bantu-speakers, including both Hutu and Tutsi, had organized themselves into small states. According to Bethwell Allan Ogot, these included at least three. The oldest state, which has no name, was probably established by the Renge lineages of the Singa clan and covered most of modern Rwanda, besides the northern region. The Mubari state of the Zigaba (Abazigaba) clan also covered an extensive area. The Gisaka state in southeast Rwanda was powerful, maintaining its independence until the mid-19th century. However, the latter two states are largely unmentioned in contemporary discussion of Rwandan civilization.\nReign of Rwabugiri (19th century).\nIn the 19th century, the state became far more centralized, and the history far more precise. Expansion continued, reaching the shores of Lake Kivu. This expansion was less about military conquest and more about a migrating population spreading Rwandan agricultural techniques, social organization, and the extension of the political control of a \"Mwami\". Once this was established camps of warriors were established along the vulnerable borders to prevent incursions. Only against other well developed states such as Gisaka, Bugesera, and Burundi was expansion carried out primarily by force of arms.\nUnder the monarchy the economic imbalance between the Hutus and the Tutsis crystallized, and a complex political imbalance emerged as the Tutsis formed into a hierarchy dominated by a \"Mwami\" or 'king'. The King was treated as a semi-divine being, responsible for making the country prosper. The symbol of the King was the Kalinga, the sacred drum.\nThe \"Mwami\"'s main power base was in control of over a hundred large estates spread through the kingdom. Including fields of banana plants and many head of cattle, the estates were the basis of the rulers' wealth. The most ornate of the estates would each be home to one of the king's wives, monarchs having up to twenty. It was between these estates that the Mwami and his retinue would travel.\nAll the people of Rwanda were expected to pay tribute to the Mwami; it was collected by a Tutsi administrative hierarchy. Beneath the Mwami was a Tutsi ministerial council of great chiefs, some of them were the chiefs of cattle, chiefs of land and last but not least the military chiefs. \"batware b'intebe\", while below them was a group of lesser Tutsi chiefs, who for the large part governed the country in districts, each district having a cattle chief and a land chief. The cattle chief collected tribute in livestock, and the land chief collected tribute in produce. Beneath these chiefs were hill-chiefs and neighborhood chiefs. More than 95% of hill and neighborhood chiefs were of Tutsi descent.\nAlso important were military chiefs, who had control over the frontier regions. They played both defensive and offensive roles, protecting the frontier and making cattle raids against neighboring tribes. Often, the Rwandan great chief was also the army chief. Lastly, the biru or \"council of guardians\" was also an important part of the administration. The Biru advised the Mwami on his duties where supernatural king-powers were involved. These honored people advised also on matters of court ritual. Taken together, all these posts from great chiefs, military chiefs and Biru members existed to serve the powers of the Mwami, and to reinforce the king's leadership in Rwanda.\nIt was after the formation of the kingdom of Rwanda that the differences between Hutu and Tutsi became more rigid and tensions began to arise. King Rwabugiri\u00b4s rule was harsh and taxes were heavy. The Tutsi aristocracy ruled by force and only Tutsi men were allowed as warriors. Hutu and Twa were allowed to fight or function as auxiliaries but did not receive the Tutsi warrior training. These young men were indoctrinated during their training with the idea of Tutsi supremacy.\nDue to their position of power and system of exploitation of the Hutu peasantry a sort of feudal relationship developed where Tutsi aristocracy started to see themselves as superior beings, turning the Hutu into second class citizens. Rebellions by Hutu peasantry were struck down without mercy, with villages being massacred and property being confiscated.\nA traditional local justice system called \"Gacaca\" predominated in much of the region as an institution for resolving conflict, rendering justice and reconciliation. The Tutsi king was the ultimate judge and arbiter for those cases that reached him. Despite the traditional nature of the system, harmony and cohesion had been established among Rwandans and within the kingdom since the beginning of Rwanda. This justice system became however more and more biased against the Hutu over time. For instance, Tutsi who stole cattle from Hutu would generally remain unpunished while Hutu stealing cattle from Tutsi would generally receive the death penalty for their crime. If a Tutsi murdered a Hutu the Mwami could order the killing of one of the Tutsi's kinsmen as a form of retribution. When a Hutu killed a Tutsi the punishment differed, with the Mwami ordering the execution of not one but two of the Hutu's kinsmen as punishment.\nThe distinction between the three ethnic groups was somewhat fluid, in that Tutsis who lost their cattle due to a disease epidemic, such as \"rinderpest\", sometimes would be considered Hutu. Likewise Hutu who obtained cattle would come to be considered Tutsi, thus climbing the ladder of the social strata. This process was called Kwihutura and was performed with permission from the Mwami. By the 19th century the rate of social mobility had severely dwindled and cases of \"class promotion\" had become exceedingly rare, which slowly changed the kingdom into a caste system. What little social mobility was left ended abruptly with the onset of colonial administration.\nColonial Rwanda.\nUnlike much of Africa, Rwanda and the Great Lakes region was not divided by the 1884 Berlin Conference. This declared Rwanda and Burundi as part of the German Empire as colonial spheres of interest in exchange for renouncing all claims on Uganda. The inferior European maps referenced in these agreements left Belgium with a claim on the western half of the country; after several border skirmishes the final borders of the colony were not established until 1900. These borders contained the Kingdom of Rwanda as well as a group of smaller kingdoms on the shore of Lake Victoria.\nIn 1894 Rutarindwa inherited the kingdom from his father Rwabugiri IV, but many on the king's council were unhappy. There was a rebellion and the family was killed. Yuhi Musinga inherited the throne through his mother and uncles, but there was still dissent.\nGerman East Africa (1885\u20131919).\nThe first European to visit or explore Rwanda was a German, Count Gustav Adolf von G\u00f6tzen, who from 1893 to 1894 led an expedition to claim the hinterlands of the Tanganyika colony. G\u00f6tzen entered Rwanda at Rusumo Falls, and then travelled through Rwanda, visiting the court of Rwabugiri in 1894, at his palace in Nyanza, and eventually reached Lake Kivu, the western edge of the kingdom. The next year the king died. With Rwanda in turmoil over the succession, the Germans moved in (in 1897, from Tanzania) to claim the region for the Kaiser. With only 2,500 soldiers in East Africa, Germany hardly changed the social structures in much of the region, especially in Rwanda.\nWar and division opened the door for colonialism, and in 1897 German colonists and missionaries came to the location of Rwanda. Some of them were said to have thought that the Osi tribe and the Hutus might have been here. The Rwandans were divided; a portion of the royal court was wary and the other thought the Germans might be a good alternative to dominance by Buganda or the Belgians. Backing their faction in the country a pliant government was soon in place. Rwanda put up less resistance than Burundi did to German rule.\nGerman rule in this most inaccessible of colonies was indirect, achieved mainly by placing agents at the courts of the various local rulers. The Germans did not encourage modernization and centralization of the regime; however, they did introduce the collection of cash taxes. The Germans hoped cash taxes, rather than taxes in kind, would force farmers to switch to tradable crops, like coffee, in order to acquire the required cash to pay taxes. This policy led to changes in the Rwandan, Burundi, Congolese, and Nigerian economies.\nDuring this period, decreasing numbers accepted race. German officials and colonists in Rwanda incorporated these theories into their native policies. The Germans believed the Tutsi ruling class was racially superior to the other native peoples of Rwanda because of their alleged \"Hamitic\" origins on the Horn of Africa, which they believed made them more \"European\" than the Hutu. The colonists, including powerful Roman Catholic officials, favored the Tutsis because of their taller stature, more \"honorable and eloquent\" personalities, and willingness to convert to Roman Catholicism. The Germans favored Tutsi dominance over the farming Hutus (almost in a feudalistic manner) and granted them basic ruling positions. These positions eventually turned into the overall governing body of Rwanda.\nPrior to the colonial period the Tutsis comprised about 15 to 16% of the population. While many Hutus were poor peasants, they comprised the majority of the ruling elite and monarchy. A significant minority of the remaining non-Tutsi political elite were Hutu.\nThe German presence had somewhat differing effects on the authority the Rwandan governing powers. The Germans helped the Mwami increase their control over Rwandan affairs. But Tutsi power weakened with the growth of trade and through increased integration with outside markets and economies. Money came to be seen by many Hutus as a replacement for cattle, in terms of both economic prosperity and for purposes of creating social standing. Another way in which Tutsi power was weakened by Germany was through the introduction of the head-tax on all Rwandans. As some Tutsis had feared, the tax also made the Hutus feel less bonded to their Tutsi patrons and more dependent on the European foreigners. A head-tax implied equality among those being counted. Despite Germany's attempt to uphold traditional Tutsi domination of the Hutus, the Hutu began to shift their ideas.\nBy 1899 the Germans had placed advisors at the courts of local chiefs. The Germans were preoccupied with fighting uprisings in Tanganyika, especially the Maji Maji war of 1905\u20131907. On May 14, 1910 the European Convention of Brussels fixed the borders of Uganda, Congo, and German East Africa, which included Tanganyika and Ruanda-Urundi. In 1911, the Germans helped the Tutsi put down a rebellion of Hutu in the northern part of Rwanda who did not wish to submit to central Tutsi control.\nBelgian League of Nations mandate (1916\u20131945).\nAt the end of WWI, Belgium accepted the League of Nations Mandate of 1916 to govern Rwanda as one of the two kingdoms making up the territory Ruanda-Urundi, along with its existing Congo colony to the west. The portion of the German territory, never a part of the Kingdom of Rwanda, was stripped from the colony and attached to Tanganyika mandate. A colonial military campaign from 1923 to 1925 brought the small independent kingdoms to the west, such as Kingogo, Bushiru, Bukunzi and Busozo, under the power of the central Rwandan court.\nThe Belgian government continued to rely on the Tutsi power structure for administering the country, although they became more directly involved in extended its interests into education and agricultural supervision. The Belgians introduced cassava, maize and the Irish potato, to try to improve food production for subsistence farmers. This was especially important in the face of two droughts and subsequent famines in 1928\u201329 and in 1943\u201344. In the second, known as the Ruzagayura famine, one-fifth to one-third of the population died. In addition, many Rwandans migrated to neighboring Congo, adding to later instability there.\nThe Belgians intended the colony to be profitable. They introduced coffee as a commodity crop and used a system of forced labor to have it cultivated. Each peasant was required to devote a certain percentage of their fields to coffee and this was enforced by the Belgians and their local, mainly Tutsi, allies. A system of \"corv\u00e9e\" that had existed under \"Mwami\" Rwabugiri was used. This forced labour approach to colonization was condemned by many internationally, and was extremely unpopular in Rwanda. Hundreds of thousands of Rwandans immigrated to the British protectorate of Uganda, which was much wealthier and did not have the same policies.\nBelgian rule reinforced an ethnic divide between the Tutsi and Hutu, and they supported Tutsis political power. Due to the eugenics movement in Europe and the United States, the colonial government became concerned with the differences between Hutu and Tutsi. Scientists arrived to measure skull\u2014and thus, they believed, brain\u2014size. Tutsi's skulls were bigger, they were taller, and their skin was lighter. As a result of this, Europeans came to believe that Tutsis had Caucasian ancestry, and were thus \"superior\" to Hutus. Each citizen was issued a racial identification card, which defined one as legally Hutu or Tutsi. The Belgians gave the majority of political control to the Tutsis. Tutsis began to believe the myth of their superior racial status, and exploited their power over the Hutu majority. In the 1920s, Belgian ethnologists analysed (measured skulls, etc.) thousands of Rwandans on analogous racial criteria. These measurements were however not used during the implementation of the identity card. In 1931, the ethnic identity was officially mandated and administrative documents systematically detailed each person's \"ethnicity,\". Rwandans had to apply for their identity card. During their application they were asked basic information such as their name, age and ethnicity. They could choose between Hutu, Tutsi or Twa. Most Rwandans were Hutu and answered as such, although when people started to suspect being Tutsi came with special privileges some lied and stated their ethnicity as Tutsi. When they applications were over however, the ethnic identity was fixed, as it was inherited patrilinealy. 84% of Rwandans were assigned Hutu, 14% Tutsi and around 1% Twa. Each Rwandan had an ethnic identity card.\nA history of Rwanda that justified the existence of these racial distinctions was written. No historical, archaeological, or above all linguistic traces have been found to date that confirm this official history. The observed differences between the Tutsis and the Hutus are about the same as those evident between the different British social classes in the 1950s. The way people nourished themselves explains a large part of the differences: the Tutsis, since they raised cattle, traditionally drank more milk than the Hutu, who were farmers.\nThe fragmenting of Hutu lands angered Mwami Yuhi IV, who had hoped to further centralize his power enough to get rid of the Belgians. In 1931 Tutsi plots against the Belgian administration resulted in the Belgians' deposing the Tutsi Mwami Yuhi. The Tutsis took up arms against the Belgians, but feared the Belgians' military superiority and did not openly revolt. Yuhi was replaced by Mutara III, his son. In 1943, he became the first Mwami to convert to Catholicism.\nFrom 1935 on, \"Tutsi\", \"Hutu\" and \"Twa\" were indicated on identity cards. However, because of the existence of many wealthy Hutu who shared the financial (if not physical) stature of the Tutsi, the Belgians used an expedient method of classification based on the number of cattle a person owned. Anyone with ten or more cattle was considered a member of the Tutsi class. The Roman Catholic Church, the primary educators in the country, subscribed to and reinforced the differences between Hutu and Tutsi. They developed separate educational systems for each, although throughout the 1940s and 1950s the vast majority of students were Tutsi.\nBelgian UN trust territory (1945\u20131961).\nFollowing World War II, Ruanda-Urundi became a United Nations trust territory with Belgium as the administrative authority. Reforms instituted by the Belgians in the 1950s encouraged the growth of democratic political institutions but were resisted by the Tutsi traditionalists, who saw them as a threat to Tutsi rule.\nFrom the late 1940s, King Rudahigwa, a Tutsi with democratic vision, abolished the \"ubuhake\" system and redistributed cattle and land. Although the majority of pasture lands remained under Tutsi control, the Hutu began to feel more liberation from Tutsi rule. Through the reforms, the Tutsis were no longer perceived to be in total control of cattle, the long-standing measure of a person's wealth and social position. The reforms contributed to ethnic tensions.\nThe Belgian institution of ethnic identity cards contributed to the growth of group identities. Belgium introduced electoral representation for Rwandans, by means of secret ballot. The majority Hutus made enormous gains within the country. The Catholic Church, too, began to oppose Tutsi mistreatment of Hutus, and began promoting equality.\nMwami Mutara took steps to end the destabilization and chaos he saw in the land. Mutara made many changes; in 1954 he shared out the land between the Hutu and the Tutsi, and agreed to abolish the system of indentured servitude (\"ubuhake\" and \"uburetwa\") the Tutsis had practised over the Hutu until then.\nStrife and lead up to independence.\nIn the 1950s and early 1960s, a wave of Pan-Africanism swept through Central Africa, expressed by leaders such as Julius Nyerere in Tanzania and Patrice Lumumba in the Congo. Anti-colonial sentiment rose throughout central Africa, and a socialist platform of African unity and equality for all Africans was promoted. Nyerere wrote about the elitism of educational systems.\nEncouraged by the Pan-Africanists, Hutu advocates in the Catholic Church, and by Christian Belgians (who were increasingly influential in the Congo), Hutu resentment of the Tutsi increased. The United Nations mandates, the Tutsi elite class, and the Belgian colonialists added to the growing unrest. Gr\u00e9goire Kayibanda, founder of PARMEHUTU, led the Hutu \"emancipation\" movement. In 1957, he wrote the \"Hutu Manifesto\". His party quickly became militarized. In reaction, in 1959 the Tutsi formed the UNAR party, lobbying for immediate independence for Ruanda-Urundi, to be based on the existing Tutsi monarchy. This group also became militarized. Skirmishes began between UNAR and PARMEHUTU groups. In July 1959, when the Tutsi Mwami (King) Mutara III Charles died following a routine vaccination, some Tutsi thought he had been assassinated. His younger half-brother became the next Tutsi monarch, Mwami (King) Kigeli V.\nIn November 1959, Tutsis tried to assassinate Kayibanda. Rumors of the death of Hutu politician Dominique Mbonyumutwa at the hands of Tutsis, who had beaten him, set off a violent retaliation, called the wind of destruction. Hutus killed an estimated 20,000 to 100,000 Tutsi; thousands more, including the Mwami, fled to neighboring Uganda before Belgian commandos arrived to quell the violence. Tutsi leaders accused the Belgians of abetting the Hutus. A UN special commission reported racism reminiscent of \"Nazism\" against the Tutsi minorities, and discriminatory actions by the government and Belgian authorities.\nThe revolution of 1959 marked a major change in political life in Rwanda. Some 150,000 Tutsis were exiled to neighboring countries. Tutsis who remained in Rwanda were excluded from political power in a state becoming more centralized under Hutu power. Tutsi refugees also fled to the South Kivu province of the Congo, where they were known as \"Banyamalenge\".\nIn 1960, the Belgian government agreed to hold democratic municipal elections in Ruanda-Urundi. The Hutu majority elected Hutu representatives. Such changes ended the Tutsi monarchy, which had existed for centuries. A Belgian effort to create an independent Ruanda-Urundi with Tutsi-Hutu power sharing failed, largely due to escalating violence. At the urging of the UN, the Belgian government divided Ruanda-Urundi into two separate countries, Rwanda and Burundi.\nIndependence (1962).\nOn 25 September 1961, a referendum was held to establish whether Rwanda should become a republic or remain a kingdom. Citizens voted overwhelmingly for a republic. After parliamentary elections held on the same day, the first Rwandese Republic was declared, with Kayibanda as prime minister. Dominique Mbonyumutwa was named the first president of the transitional government.\nBetween 1961 and 1962, Tutsi guerrilla groups staged attacks into Rwanda from neighboring countries. Rwandan Hutu-based troops responded, and thousands more were killed in the clashes.\nOn 1 July 1962, Belgium, with UN oversight, granted full independence to the two countries. Rwanda was created as a republic governed by the majority MDR-Parmehutu, which had gained full control of national politics. In 1963, a Tutsi guerrilla invasion into Rwanda from Burundi unleashed another anti-Tutsi backlash by the Hutu government; their forces killed an estimated 14,000 people. The economic union between Rwanda and Burundi was dissolved and tensions between the two countries worsened. Rwanda became a Hutu-dominated one-party state. In excess of 70,000 people had been killed.\nKayibanda became Rwanda's first elected president, leading a government chosen from the membership of the directly elected unicameral National Assembly of Rwanda. Peaceful negotiation of international problems, social and economic elevation of the masses, and integrated development of Rwanda were the ideals of the Kayibanda regime. He established formal relations with 43 countries, including the United States, in the first ten years. Despite the progress made, inefficiency and corruption developed in government ministries in the mid-1960s.\nThe Kayibanda administration established quotas to try to increase the number of Hutu in schools and the civil service. This effort ended up penalizing the Tutsi. They were allowed only nine percent of secondary school and university seats, which was their proportion of the population. The quotas also extended to the civil service. With unemployment high, competition for such opportunities increased ethnic tensions. The Kayibanda government also continued the Belgian colonial government's policy of requiring ethnic identity cards, and it discouraged \"mixed\" marriages.\nFollowing more violence in 1964, the government suppressed political opposition. It banned the political parties UNAR and RADER and executed Tutsi members. Hutu militants used the term \"inyenzi\" (cockroaches) as a pejorative to describe Tutsi rebels for what was perceived as infiltrating the country. Hundreds of thousands of refugees moved to neighbouring countries.\nThe Catholic Church was closely involved with Parmehutu, and they shared local resources and networks. Through the church, the government maintained links with supporters in Belgium and Germany. The country's two newspapers supported the government and were Catholic publications.\nMilitary rule.\nOn July 5, 1973, Defence Minister Maj. Gen. Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana overthrew Kayibanda. He suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly of Rwanda and imposed a strict ban on all political activity.\nInitially, Habyarimana abolished the quota system, winning him favour among Tutsi. However, this didn't last. In 1974, a public outcry developed over Tutsi over-representation in professional fields such as medicine and education. Thousands of Tutsi were forced to resign from such positions, and many were forced into exile. In associated violence, several hundred Tutsi were killed. Gradually, Habyarimana reimposed many of his predecessor's policies favouring Hutu over Tutsi.\nIn 1975, President Habyarimana formed the National Revolutionary Movement for Development (MRND) whose goals were to promote peace, unity, and national development. The movement was organized from the \"hillside\" to the national level and included elected and appointed officials.\nUnder MRND aegis, a new constitution making the country a totalitarian one-party state under the MRND was approved in a referendum in December 1978. These were shortly followed by presidential elections a few weeks later. Habyarimana, as president of the MRND, was the only candidate on the ballot. He was re-elected in 1983 and again in 1988, each time as sole candidate. However, in a minor concession to democracy, voters were given a choice of two MRND candidates in elections to the National Development Council of Rwanda. Responding to public pressure for political reform, President Habyarimana announced in July 1990 his intention to transform Rwanda's one-party state into a multi-party democracy.\nInter-relationship with events in Burundi.\nThe situation in Rwanda had been influenced in great detail by the situation in Burundi. Both countries had a Hutu majority, yet an army-controlled Tutsi government in Burundi persisted for decades. After the assassination of Rwagasore, his UPRONA party was split into Tutsi and Hutu factions. A Tutsi Prime Minister was chosen by the monarch, but, a year later in 1963, the monarch was forced to appoint a Hutu prime minister, Pierre Ngendandumwe, in an effort to satisfy growing Hutu unrest. Nevertheless, the monarch soon replaced him with another Tutsi prince. In Burundi's first elections following independence, in 1965, Ngendandumwe was elected Prime Minister. He was immediately assassinated by a Tutsi extremist and he was succeeded by another Hutu, Joseph Bamina. Hutus won 23 of the 33 seats in national elections a few months later, but the monarch nullified the elections. Bamina was soon also assassinated and the Tutsi monarch installed his own personal secretary, Leopold Biha, as the Prime Minister in his place. This led to a Hutu coup from which the Mwami fled the country and Biha was shot (but not killed). The Tutsi-dominated army, led by Michel Micombero brutally responded: almost all Hutu politicians were killed. Micombero assumed control of the government and a few months later deposed the new Tutsi monarch (the son of the previous monarch) and abolished the role of the monarchy altogether. He then threatened to invade Rwanda. A military dictatorship persisted in Burundi for another 27 years, until the next free elections, in 1993.\nAnother seven years of sporadic violence in Burundi (from 1965\u20131972) existed between the Hutus and Tutsis. In 1969 another purge of Hutus by the Tutsi military occurred. Then, a localized Hutu uprising in 1972 was fiercely answered by the Tutsi-dominated Burundi army in the largest Burundi genocide of Hutus, with a death toll nearing 200,000.\nThis wave of violence led to another wave of cross border refugees into Rwanda of Hutus from Burundi. Now there were large numbers of both Tutsi and Hutu refugees throughout the region, and tensions continued to mount.\nIn 1988, Hutu violence against Tutsis throughout northern Burundi again resurfaced, and in response the Tutsi army massacred approximately 20,000 more Hutu. Again, thousands of Hutus were forced into exile into Tanzania and Congo to flee another genocide of Hutu.\nCivil war and genocide.\nMany exiled refugee Rwandan Tutsis in Uganda had joined the rebel forces of Yoweri Kaguta Museveni in the Ugandan Bush War and had then become part of the Ugandan military upon the rebel victory in 1986. Among these were Fred Rwigyema and Paul Kagame, who rose to prominence in the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a Rwandan rebel group largely consisting of Tutsi veterans of the Ugandan war. On October 1, 1990, the RPF invaded Rwanda from their base in neighboring Uganda. The rebel force, composed primarily of ethnic Tutsis, blamed the government for failing to democratize and resolve the problems of some 500,000 Tutsi refugees living in diaspora around the world.\nThe Tutsi diaspora miscalculated the reaction of its invasion of Rwanda. Though the Tutsi objective seemed to be to pressure the Rwandan government into making concessions, the invasion was seen as an attempt to bring the Tutsi ethnic group back into power. The effect was to increase ethnic tensions to a level higher than they had ever been. Nevertheless, after 3 years of fighting and multiple prior \"cease-fires,\" the government and the RPF signed a \"final\" cease-fire agreement in August 1993, known as the Arusha Accords, in order to form a power sharing government, a plan which immediately ran into problems.\nThe situation worsened when the first elected Burundian president, Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, was assassinated by the Burundian Tutsi-dominated army in October 1993. In Burundi, a fierce civil war then erupted between Tutsi and Hutu following the army's massacre. This conflict spilled over the border into Rwanda and destabilized the fragile Rwandan accords. Tutsi-Hutu tensions rapidly intensified. Although the UN sent a peacekeeping force named the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), it was underfunded, under-staffed, and largely ineffective in the face of a two country civil-war. The UN denied Lieutenant-General Rom\u00e9o Dallaire's request for additional troops and changes to the rules of engagement to prevent the coming genocide.\n1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda.\nOn April 6, 1994, the airplane carrying Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana, the President of Rwanda, and Cyprien Ntaryamira, the Hutu President of Burundi, was shot down as it prepared to land at Kigali. Both presidents were killed when the plane crashed.\nMilitary and militia groups began rounding up and killing Tutsis \"en masse\", as well as political moderates irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. The killing swiftly spread from Kigali to all corners of the country; between April 6 and the beginning of July, a genocide of unprecedented swiftness left between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsis (800,000 is a commonly noted number) and moderate Hutus dead at the hands of organized bands of militia (Interahamwe). Even ordinary citizens were called on by local officials to kill their neighboring Tutsis who were called \"Inyenzi\" (cockroaches) by the local radio stations inciting fear and hatred. The president's MRND Party was implicated in organizing many aspects of the genocide. The Hutu genocidaires were abetted by the Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des Mille Collines broadcasting hate speech advocating violence against Tutsis. It broadcast at the same time as Radio Muhabura broadcast from Uganda, sponsored by the RPF and their Ugandan allies.\nThe RPF renewed its civil war against the Rwanda Hutu government when it received word that the genocidal massacres had begun. Its leader Paul Kagame directed RPF forces in neighboring countries such as Uganda and Tanzania to invade the country. The resulting civil war raged concurrently with the genocide for two months. The Tutsi-led RPF continued to advance on the capital, and soon occupied the northern, eastern, and southern parts of the country by June. Thousands of additional civilians were killed in the conflict. UN member states refused to answer UNAMIR's requests for increased troops and money. The remaining part of the country not under RPF control was occupied by France in Operation Turquoise. While the French operation did prevent mass killings it has been alleged that the deployment of French troops was intended to allow the Hutu militias to escape, and that the slaughter of Tutsis continued in the French controlled area.\nPost-civil war Rwanda.\nBetween July and August 1994, Kagame's Tutsi-led RPF troops first entered Kigali and soon thereafter captured the rest of the country. The Tutsi rebels defeated the Hutu regime and ended the genocide, but approximately two million Hutu refugees\u2014some who participated in the genocide and fearing Tutsi retribution\u2014fled to neighboring Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire. This exodus became known as the Great Lakes refugee crisis.\nAfter the Tutsi RPF took control of the government, in 1994, Kagame formed a government of national unity headed by a Hutu president, Pasteur Bizimungu. Kagame became Minister of Defence and Vice-President of Rwanda and was the de facto leader of the country.\nFollowing an uprising by the ethnic Tutsi, sometimes referred to as a whole as Banyamulenge (although this term only represents people from one area in eastern Zaire\u2014other ethnic Tutsi Kinyarwanda-speaking people include the \"Banyamasisi\" and the \"Banyarutshuru\", as an example) people in eastern Zaire in October 1997, a huge movement of refugees began which brought more than 600,000 back to Rwanda in the last two weeks of November. This massive repatriation was followed at the end of December 1996 by the return of another 500,000 from Tanzania, again in a huge, spontaneous wave. Less than 100,000 Rwandans are estimated to remain outside of Rwanda, and they are thought to be the remnants of the defeated army of the former genocidal government, its allies in the civilian militias known as Interahamwe, and soldiers recruited in the refugee camps before 1996. There are also many innocent Hutu who remain in the forests of eastern Congo, particularly Rutshuru, Masisi and Bukavu, who have been misinformed by rebel forces that they will be killed upon return to Rwanda. Rebels also use force to prevent these people from returning, as they serve as a human shield.\nIn northwest Rwanda, Hutu militia members killed three Spanish aid workers, three soldiers and seriously wounded one other on January 18, 1997. Since then, most of the refugees have returned and the country is secure for tourists.\nRwandan coffee began to gain importance after international taste tests pronounced it among the best in the world, and the U.S. responded with a contribution of 8 million dollars. Rwanda now earns some revenue from coffee and tea export, although it has been difficult to compete with larger coffee-producing countries. The main source of revenue, however, is tourism, mainly mountain gorilla visitation. Their other parks, Nyungwe Forest (one of the last high-altitude tropical forests in the world) and Akagera National Park (a safari game park) have also become popular on the tourism circuit. The lakeside resorts of Gisenyi and Kibuye are also gaining ground.\nWhen Bizimungu became critical of the Kagame government in 2000, he was removed as president and Kagame took over the presidency himself. Bizimungu immediately founded an opposition party (the PDR), but it was banned by the Kagame government. Bizimungu was arrested in 2002 for treason, sentenced to 15 years in prison, but released by a presidential pardon in 2007.\nThe postwar government has placed high priority on development, opening water taps in the most remote areas, providing free and compulsory education, and promulgating progressive environmental policies. Their Vision 2020 development policy has the aim of achieving a service-based society by 2020, with a significant middle class. There is relatively little corruption in the country: after Botswana and Cape Verde, it is the third least corrupt country in Africa according to the Corruption Perceptions Index as of 2022.\nHutu Rwandan genocidal leaders were put on trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, in the Rwandan National Court system, and, most recently, through the informal Gacaca programme. Recent reports highlight a number of reprisal killings of survivors for giving evidence at Gacaca. These Gacaca trials are overseen by the government established National Unity and Reconciliation Commission. \"Gacaca\" is a traditional adjudication mechanism at the \"umudugudu\" (village) level, whereby members of the community elect elders to serve as judges, and the entire community is present for the case. This system was modified to try lower-level \"g\u00e9nocidaires\", those who had killed or stolen but did not organize massacres. Prisoners, dressed in pink, stand trial before members of their community. Judges accord sentences, which vary widely, from returning to prison, to paying back the cost of goods stolen, to working in the fields of families of victims. \"Gacaca\" officially concluded in June 2012. For many, \"Gacaca\" has been a vehicle for closure, and prisoners' testimonies have helped many families locate victims. \"Gacaca\" takes place once a week in the morning in every village across Rwanda and is compulsory.\nEthnicity has been formally outlawed in Rwanda, in the effort to promote a culture of healing and unity. One can stand trial for discussion of the different ethnic groups.\nRwanda has become a President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) focus country, and the United States has been providing AIDS programming, education, training, and treatment. Rwandans who have been infected can now receive free antiretroviral drugs in health centers across the country, as well as food packages.\nFirst and Second Congo Wars.\nIn order to protect the country against the Hutu Interahamwe forces, which had fled to Eastern Zaire, RPF forces invaded Zaire in 1996, following talks by Kagame with US officials earlier the same year. In this invasion Rwanda allied with Laurent Kabila, a progressist revolutionary in Eastern Zaire who had been a foe of Zaire's long-time dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko. In addition to Rwandan forces, Laurent Kabila's AFDL (Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo) forces were also supported by Ugandan forces, with whom Kagame had trained in the late 1980s, which then invaded Eastern Zaire from the northeast. This became known as the First Congo War.\nIn this war, militarized Tutsi elements in the South Kivu area of Zaire, known as Banyamulenge to disguise their original Rwandan Tutsi heritage, allied with the Tutsi RDF forces against the Hutu refugees in the North Kivu area, which included the Interahamwe militias.\nIn the midst of this conflict, Kabila, whose primary intent had been to depose Mobutu, moved his forces to Kinshasa, and in 1997, the same year Mobutu Sese Seko died of prostate cancer, Kabila captured Kinshasa and then became president of Zaire, which he then renamed to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. With Kabila's success in the Congo, he no longer desired an alliance with the Tutsi-RPF Rwandan army and the Ugandan forces, and in August 1998 ordered both the Ugandans and Tutsi-Rwandan army out of the DRC. However, neither Kagame's Rwandan Tutsi forces nor Museveni's Ugandan forces had any intention of leaving the Congo, and the framework of the Second Congo War was laid.\nDuring the Second Congo War, Tutsi militias among the Banyamulenge in the Congo province of Kivu desired to annex themselves to Rwanda (now dominated by Tutsi forces under the Kagame government). Kagame also desired this, both to increase the resources of Rwanda by adding those of the Kivu region, and also to add the Tutsi population, which the Banyamulenge represented, back into Rwanda, thereby reinforcing his political base and protecting the indigenous Tutsis living there, who had also suffered massacres from the Interhamwe.\nIn the Second Congo War, Uganda and Rwanda attempted to wrest much of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from Kabila's forces, and nearly succeeded. However, the DRC being a member of the SADC (Southern Africa Development Community) organisation, President Laurent Kabila called this regional organisation to the rescue. Armies were sent to aid Kabila, most notably those of Angola and Zimbabwe. These armies were able to beat back Kagame's Rwandan-Tutsi advances and the Ugandan forces.\nIn the great conflict between 1998 and 2002, during which Congo was divided into three parts, multiple opportunistic militias, called Mai Mai, sprang up, supplied by the arms dealers around the world that profit in small arms trading, including the US, Russia, China, and other countries. Over 5.4 million people died in the conflict, as well as the majority of animals in the region.\nLaurent Kabila was assassinated in the DRC (Congo) in 2001, and was succeeded by his son, Joseph Kabila. The latter was chosen unanimously by the political class because of the role he played in the army, being the \"de facto' officer in charge of the well trained batailions that defeated the Mobutu army and were fighting alongside SADC coalition forces. Joseph speaks fluent French, English and Swahili, one of the four national languages of the DRC. He studied in Tanzania and Uganda in his earlier years. He completed his military training in China. After serving 5 years as the transitional government president, he was freely-elected in the Congo to be president, in 2006, largely on the basis of his support in the Eastern Congo.\nUgandan and Rwandan forces within Congo began to battle each other for territory, and Congolese Mai Mai militias, most active in the South and North Kivu provinces (in which most refugees were located) took advantage of the conflict to settle local scores and widen the conflict, battling each other, Ugandan and Rwandan forces, and even Congolese forces.\nThe war was ended when, under Joseph Kabila's leadership, a ceasefire was signed and the all-inclusive Sun City (South Africa) talks were convened to decide on a two years transition period and the organisation of free and fair elections.\nRwandan RPF troops finally left Congo in 2002, leaving a wake of disease and malnutrition that continued to kill thousands every month. However, Rwandan rebels continue to operate (as of May 2007) in the northeast Congo and Kivu regions. These are claimed to be remnants of Hutu forces that cannot return to Rwanda without facing genocide charges, yet are not welcomed in Congo and are pursued by DRC troops. In the first 6 months of 2007, over 260,000 civilians were displaced. Congolese Mai Mai rebels also continue to threaten people and wildlife. Although a large scale effort at disarming militias has succeeded, with the aid of the UN troops, the last militias are only being disarmed in 2007. However, fierce confrontations in the northeast regions of the Congo between local tribes in the Ituri region, initially uninvolved with the Hutu-Tutsi conflict but drawn into the Second Congo War, still continue.\nRwanda today.\nRwanda today struggles to heal and rebuild, showing signs of rapid economic development, but with growing international concern about the decline of human rights within the country.\nEconomically, the major markets for Rwandan exports are Belgium, Germany, and People's Republic of China. In April 2007, an investment and trade agreement, four years in the making, was worked out between Belgium and Rwanda. Belgium contributes \u20ac25\u201335 million per year to Rwanda. Belgian co-operation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry continues to develop and rebuild agricultural practices in the country. It has distributed agricultural tools and seed to help rebuild the country. Belgium also helped in re-launching fisheries in Lake Kivu, at a value of US$470,000, in 2001.\nIn Eastern Rwanda, The Clinton Hunter Development Initiative, along with Partners in Health, are helping to improve agricultural productivity, improve water and sanitation and health services, and help cultivate international markets for agricultural products. Since 2000, the Rwandan government has expressed interest in transforming the country from agricultural subsistence to a knowledge-based economy, and plans to provide high-speed broadband across the entire country.\nRwanda applied to join the Commonwealth of Nations in 2007 and 2009, a sign that is trying to distance itself from French foreign policy. In 2007, it applied unsuccessfully to join at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting at Kampala in Uganda, but was accepted into membership in 2009 at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Port of Spain, Trinidad. Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith publicly stated this would help \"entrench the rule of law and support the Rwandan Government's efforts towards democracy and economic growth.\" Rwanda also joined the East African Community in 2009 at the same time as its neighbor Burundi.\nHowever, since then Freedom House rates Rwanda as \"not free\", with political rights and civil liberties trending downwards. In 2010 Amnesty International \"strongly condemned a worrying attack on a Rwandan opposition group\" in the lead-up to presidential elections, citing the case of Victoire Ingabire, president of the FDU-Inkingi (United Democratic Forces) and her aide Joseph Ntawangundi, attacked in February 2010 while collecting party registration documents from a government building in Kigali. In April, Rwandan Immigration proceeded to reject a work visa re-application by the Rwanda-based researcher for Human Rights Watch. The sole new opposition party to secure registration, PS-Imberakuri, had its presidential candidate Bernard Ntaganda arrested on June 24, charged with \"genocide ideology\" and \"divisionism\".\nRwandan Green Party President, Frank Habineza also reported threats. In October 2009 a Rwandan Green Party meeting was violently broken up by police, with authorities placing preventing the registration of the party or allowing it to run a candidate in the presidential election. Only weeks before the election, on 14 July 2009, Andr\u00e9 Kagwa Rwisereka, the vice president of the opposition Democratic Green Party was found dead, with his head severed almost entirely, in Butare, southern Rwanda.\nPublic scrutiny of the government's policies and practices has been limited by press freedom. In June 2009 journalist for Umuvugizi newspaper Jean-Leonard Rugambage was shot dead outside his home in Kigali. Umuvugizi at the time was supporting a critical investigation into the attempted murder of former Rwandan general Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa, in exile in South Africa. In July 2009 Agnes Nkusi Uwimana, editor of the \"Umurabyo\" newspaper, charged with \"genocide ideology.\" As the presidential election got closer, two other newspaper editors left Rwanda.\nThe United Nations, European Union, the United States, France and Spain publicly expressed concerns.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The majority of his novels take place in fictional settings that resemble real places during real historical periods, such as Constantinople during the reign of Justinian I or Spain during the time of El Cid. Kay has expressed a preference to avoid genre categorization of these works as historical fantasy. As of 2025[ [update]], Kay has published 16 novels and a book of poetry. As of 2018[ [update]], his fiction has been translated into at least 22 languages. Kay is also a qualified lawyer in Canada.\nBiography.\nKay was born in Weyburn, Saskatchewan, in 1954. His father, a doctor, was a Jewish immigrant from Poland, and his mother was an artist. He was raised and educated in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and received a bachelor's degree in philosophy from the University of Manitoba in 1975.\nWhen Christopher Tolkien needed an assistant to edit his father J. R. R. Tolkien's unpublished work, he chose Kay, then a student of philosophy at the University of Manitoba, because of a family connection. Kay moved to Oxford in 1974 to assist Christopher in editing \"The Silmarillion\".\nKay returned to Canada in 1975 to pursue a law degree at the University of Toronto, which he obtained in 1978; he was called to the bar of Ontario in 1981. Kay became principal writer and an associate producer for the CBC Radio series \"The Scales of Justice,\" and continued as principal writer when the series transferred to television as \"Scales of Justice\".\nKay's first novel, the portal fantasy \"The Summer Tree\" that serves as the first volume of his \"Fionavar Tapestry\" trilogy, was published in 1984. He subsequently had many other novels published, most of them in the field of historical fantasy.\nKay has voiced concerns relative to the decline of individual privacy, the expectation of privacy, and literary privacy. The last principally has to do with the use of real individuals in works of fiction, such as Michael Cunningham's \"The Hours\", partly based on the life of Virginia Woolf, where Woolf features in the novel as a protagonist.\nBibliography.\nNovels.\n\"Novels marked with an asterisk are set in the same world at various points in its history.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Since assuming office in 1986 at the end of the Ugandan civil war, Yoweri Museveni has ruled Uganda as a dictator. Political parties were banned from 1986 to 2006 in the wake of the 2005 Ugandan multi-party referendum which was won by pro-democracy forces. Since 2006, Museveni has used legal means, patronage, and violence to maintain power.\nUnder the Ugandan constitution, Uganda is a presidential republic in which the President is the head of state and the prime minister is the head of government business. There is a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is given to both the government and the National Assembly. The system is based on a democratic parliamentary system with equal rights for all citizens over 18 years of age.\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit rated Uganda a \"hybrid regime\" in .\nPolitical culture.\nAfter taking power after a five-year civil war in 1986, the authoritarian Yoweri Museveni regime banned political parties from campaigning in elections or field candidates directly (although electoral candidates could belong to political parties). A constitutional referendum canceled this 19-year ban on multi-party politics in July 2005.\nPresidential elections were held in February 2006.

However, the Court voted 4-3 to uphold the results of the election.\nExecutive.\nThe head of state in Uganda is the President, who is elected by a popular vote to a five-year term.
