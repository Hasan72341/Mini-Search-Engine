Its name originates from the Persian word for the gem, \"l\u0101\u017eward\", and serves as the root for the word for \"blue\" in several languages, including Spanish and Portuguese \"azul\" and English azure. Lapis lazuli is a rock composed primarily of the minerals lazurite, pyrite, diopside, and calcite. As early as the 7th millennium BC, lapis lazuli was mined in the Sar-i Sang mines, in Shortugai, and in other mines in Badakhshan province in modern northeast Afghanistan. Lapis lazuli artifacts, dated to 7570 BC, have been found at Bhirrana, which is the oldest site of Indus Valley Civilisation. Lapis was highly valued by the Indus Valley Civilisation (3300\u20131900 BC). Lapis beads have been found at Neolithic burials in Mehrgarh, the Caucasus, and as far away as Mauritania. It was used in the funeral mask of Tutankhamun (1341\u20131323 BC).\nBy the end of the Middle Ages, Europe began importing lapis lazuli to grind it into powder and make ultramarine pigment. Ultramarine was used by some of the most important artists of the Renaissance and Baroque, including Masaccio, Perugino, Titian and Vermeer; it was often reserved for the clothing of the central figures of their paintings, especially the Virgin Mary. Ultramarine has also been found in dental tartar of medieval nuns and scribes, perhaps as a result of licking their painting brushes while producing medieval texts and manuscripts.\nHistory.\nExcavations from Tepe Gawra show that lapis lazuli was introduced to Mesopotamia approximately in the late Ubaid period, c. 4900\u20134000 BCE. A traditional understanding was that the Lapis lazuli was mined some 1,500 miles to the east \u2013 in Badakhshan. Indeed, the Persian , also written , is commonly interpreted as having an origin in a local place name.\nFrom the Persian, the Arabic is the etymological source of both the English word \"azure\" (via Old French \"azur\") and Medieval Latin , which came to mean 'heaven' or 'sky'. To disambiguate, (\"stone of \") was used to refer to the stone itself, and is the term ultimately imported into Middle English. is used as a root for the word for blue in several languages, including Spanish and Portuguese .\nMines in northeast Afghanistan continue to be a major source of lapis lazuli. Important amounts are also produced from mines west of Lake Baikal in Russia, and in the Andes mountains in Chile which is the source that the Inca used to carve artifacts and jewelry. Smaller quantities are mined in Pakistan, Italy, Mongolia, the United States, and Canada.\nScience and uses.\nComposition.\nThe most important mineral component of lapis lazuli is lazurite (25% to 40%), a blue feldspathoid silicate mineral of the sodalite family, with the formula Na7Ca(Al6Si6O24)(SO4)(S3) \u00b7H2O . Most lapis lazuli also contains calcite (white), and pyrite (metallic yellow). Some samples of lapis lazuli contain augite, diopside, enstatite, mica, hauynite, hornblende, nosean, and sulfur-rich l\u00f6llingite \"geyerite\".\nLapis lazuli usually occurs in crystalline marble as a result of contact metamorphism.\nColor.\nThe intense blue color is due to the presence of the trisulfur radical anion (S3\u2022\u2212) in the crystal. The presence of disulfur (S2\u2022\u2212) and tetrasulfur (S4\u2022\u2212) radicals can shift the color towards yellow or red, respectively. These radical anions substitute for the chloride anions within the sodalite structure. The S3\u2022\u2212 radical anion exhibits a visible absorption band in the range 595\u2013620\u00a0nm with high molar absorptivity, leading to its bright blue color.\nSources.\nLapis lazuli is found in limestone in the Kokcha River valley of Badakhshan province in north-eastern Afghanistan, where the Sar-i Sang mine deposits have been worked for more than 6,000 years. Afghanistan was the source of lapis for the ancient Persian, Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations, as well as the later Greeks and Romans. Ancient Egyptians obtained the material through trade with Mesopotamians, as part of Egypt\u2013Mesopotamia relations and from ancient Ethiopia . During the height of the Indus Valley Civilisation, approximately 2000 BC, the Harappan colony, now known as Shortugai, was established near the lapis mines.\nIn addition to the Afghan deposits, lapis is also extracted in the Andes (near Ovalle, Chile); and to the west of Lake Baikal in Siberia, Russia, at the Tultui lazurite deposit. It is mined in smaller amounts in Angola, Argentina, Burma, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Canada, Italy, India, and in the United States in California and Colorado.\nUses and substitutes.\nLapis takes an excellent polish and can be made into jewellery, carvings, boxes, mosaics, ornaments, small statues, and vases. Interior items and finishing of buildings can be also made with lapis. During the Renaissance, lapis was ground and processed to make the pigment ultramarine for use in frescoes and oil painting. Its usage as a pigment in oil paint largely ended during the early 19th century, when a chemically identical synthetic variety became available.\nLapis lazuli is commercially synthesized or simulated by the Gillson process, which is used to make artificial ultramarine and hydrous zinc phosphates. Spinel or sodalite, or dyed jasper or howlite, can be substituted for lapis.\nHistory and art.\nIn the ancient world.\nLapis lazuli has been mined in Afghanistan and exported to the Mediterranean world and South Asia since the Neolithic age, along the ancient trade route between Afghanistan and the Indus Valley dating to the 7th millennium BC. Quantities of these beads have also been found at 4th millennium BC settlements in Northern Mesopotamia, and at the Bronze Age site of Shahr-e Sukhteh in southeast Iran (3rd millennium BC). A dagger with a lapis handle, a bowl inlaid with lapis, amulets, beads, and inlays representing eyebrows and beards, were found in the Royal Tombs of the Sumerian city-state of Ur from the 3rd millennium BC.\nLapis was also used in ancient Persia, Mesopotamia by the Akkadians, Assyrians, and Babylonians for seals and jewelry. It is mentioned several times in the Mesopotamian poem, the Epic of Gilgamesh (17th\u201318th century BC), one of the oldest known works of literature. The Statue of Ebih-Il, a 3rd millennium BC statue found in the ancient city-state of Mari in modern-day Syria, now in the Louvre, uses lapis lazuli inlays for the irises of the eyes.\nIn ancient Egypt, lapis lazuli was a favorite stone for amulets and ornaments such as scarabs. Lapis jewellery has been found at excavations of the Predynastic Egyptian site Naqada (3300\u20133100 BC). At Karnak, the relief carvings of Thutmose III (1479\u20131429 BC) show fragments and barrel-shaped pieces of lapis lazuli being delivered to him as tribute. Powdered lapis was used as eyeshadow by Cleopatra.\nJewelry made of lapis lazuli has also been found at Mycenae attesting to relations between the Myceneans and the developed civilizations of Egypt and the East.\nPliny the Elder wrote that lapis lazuli is \"opaque and sprinkled with specks of gold\". Because the stone combines the blue of the heavens and golden glitter of the sun, it was emblematic of success in the old Jewish tradition. In the early Christian tradition lapis lazuli was regarded as the stone of Virgin Mary.\nIn late classical times and as late as the Middle Ages, lapis lazuli was often called sapphire (\"sapphirus\" in Latin, \"sappir\" in Hebrew), though it had little to do with the stone today known as the blue corundum variety sapphire. In his book on stones, the Greek scientist Theophrastus described \"the sapphirus, which is speckled with gold,\" a description which matches lapis lazuli.\nThere are many references to \"sapphire\" in the Old Testament, but most scholars agree that, since sapphire was not known before the Roman Empire, they most likely are references to lapis lazuli. For instance, Exodus 24:10: \"And they saw the God of Israel, and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone...\" (KJV). The words used in the Latin Vulgate Bible in this citation are \"quasi opus lapidis sapphirini\", the terms for lapis lazuli. Modern translations of the Bible, such as the New Living Translation Second Edition, refer to lapis lazuli in most instances instead of sapphire.\nVermeer.\nJohannes Vermeer used lapis lazuli paint in the \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" painting.\nYeats.\nThe poet, William Butler Yeats, describes a figurine of sculpted lapis lazuli in a poem entitled \"Lapis Lazuli\". The sculpture of three men from China, a bird, and a musical instrument serves in the poem as a reminder of \"gaiety\" in the face of tragedy.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44654", "revid": "361251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44654", "title": "Metis (moon)", "text": "Moon of Jupiter\nMetis , also known as Jupiter XVI, is the innermost known moon of Jupiter. It was discovered in 1979 in images taken by \"Voyager 1\", and was named in 1983 after the Titaness Metis, the first wife of Zeus and the mother of Athena. Additional observations made between early 1996 and September 2003 by the \"Galileo\" spacecraft allowed its surface to be imaged.\nMetis is tidally locked to Jupiter, and its shape is strongly asymmetrical, with the largest diameter being almost twice as large as the smallest one. It is also one of the two moons known to orbit Jupiter in less than the length of Jupiter's day, the other being Adrastea. It orbits within the main ring of Jupiter, and is thought to be a major contributor of ring material.\nDiscovery and observations.\nMetis was discovered in 1979 by Stephen P. Synnott in images taken by the \"Voyager 1\" probe and was provisionally designated as S/1979 J 3. In 1983, it was officially named after the mythological Metis, a Titaness who was the first wife of Zeus (the Greek prototype for the Roman god Jupiter) who between her and Zeus bore a daughter, Athena. The photographs taken by \"Voyager 1\" showed Metis only as a dot, and hence knowledge about Metis was very limited until the arrival of the \"Galileo\" spacecraft. \"Galileo\" imaged almost all of the surface of Metis and put constraints on its composition by 1998.\nPhysical characteristics.\nMetis has an irregular shape and measures across, which makes it the second smallest of the four inner satellites of Jupiter. Therefore, a very rough estimate of its surface area could be placed between 5,800 and 11,600 square kilometers (approx. 8,700). The bulk composition and mass of Metis are not known, but it is likely that its mean density is 1.5\u00a0g/cm3 or higher, and its mass can therefore be estimated as ~6.4\u00d71016\u00a0kg or higher.\nThe surface of Metis is heavily cratered, dark, and appears to be reddish in color. There is a substantial asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3 times brighter than the trailing one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere, which excavates a bright material (presumably ice) from its interior.\nOrbit and rotation.\nMetis is the innermost of Jupiter's four small inner moons. It orbits Jupiter at a distance of ~128,000\u00a0km (1.79 Jupiter radii) within Jupiter's main ring. Metis's orbit has very small eccentricity (~0.0002) and inclination (~ 0.06\u00b0) relative to the equator of Jupiter.\nDue to tidal locking, Metis rotates synchronously with its orbital period (about 7 hours), with its longest axis aligned towards Jupiter. Jupiter casts a shadow on all of Metis for 68 minutes each Metian day.\nMetis lies inside Jupiter's synchronous orbit radius (as does Adrastea), and as a result, tidal forces slowly cause its orbit to decay. If its density is similar to Amalthea's, Metis's orbit lies within the fluid Roche limit; however, because it has not broken up, it must lie outside its rigid Roche limit.\nRelationship with Jupiter's rings.\nMetis's orbit lies ~1,000\u00a0km within the main ring of Jupiter. It orbits within a ~500\u00a0km wide \"gap\" or \"notch\" in the ring. The gap is clearly somehow related to the moon but the origin of this connection has not been established. Metis supplies a significant part of the main ring's dust. This material appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from the satellites into space because the satellites' surfaces lie fairly close to the edge of their Roche spheres due to their low density.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is classified primarily as a Baroque composer chronologically, although his music was influential in the development of the Classical style. Like his renowned father Alessandro Scarlatti, he composed in a variety of musical forms, although today he is known mainly for his 555 keyboard sonatas. He spent much of his life in the service of the Portuguese and Spanish royal families.\nLife and career.\nScarlatti was born in Naples, Kingdom of Naples, then belonging to the Spanish Empire. He was born in 1685, the same year as Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel. He was the sixth of ten children of the composer and teacher Alessandro Scarlatti. His older brother Pietro Filippo was also a musician.\nScarlatti first studied music under his father. Other composers who may have been his early teachers include Gaetano Greco, Francesco Gasparini, and Bernardo Pasquini.\nScarlatti was appointed as a composer and organist at the Chapel Royal of Naples in 1701 and briefly worked under his father, who was then the chapel's \"maestro di cappella\". In 1703 he revised Carlo Francesco Pollarolo's opera \"Irene\" for performance at Naples. Soon after, his father sent him to Venice. After this, nothing is known of his life until 1709, when he went to Rome and entered the service of the exiled Polish queen Marie Casimire. It was there he met Thomas Roseingrave. Scarlatti was already an accomplished harpsichordist; there is a story of a trial of skill with George Frideric Handel at the palace of Cardinal Ottoboni in Rome, where Scarlatti was judged possibly superior to Handel on the harpsichord, although inferior on the organ. Later in life, he was known to cross himself in veneration when speaking of Handel's skill.\nWhile in Rome, Scarlatti composed several operas, including \"Tolomeo e Alessandro\" (1711) and \"Amor d'un'ombra e gelosia d'un'aura\" (1714) for Queen Casimir's private theatre. He was \"Maestro di Cappella\" at St. Peter's from 1715 to 1719. In 1719 he travelled to London to direct \"Amor d'un'ombra e gelosia d'un'aura\" under the title \"Narciso\" at the King's Theatre.\nAccording to Vicente Bicchi, Papal Nuncio in Portugal at the time, Scarlatti arrived in Lisbon on 29 November 1719. There he taught music to the Portuguese princess Maria Magdalena Barbara. He left Lisbon on 28 January 1727 for Rome, where he married Maria Caterina Gentili on 6 May 1728. In 1729 he moved to Seville, staying for four years. In 1733, he went to Madrid as a music master to Princess Maria Barbara, who had married into the Spanish royal house. She later became Queen of Spain. Scarlatti remained in Spain for the remaining 25 years of his life and had five children there. After his wife died in 1739, he married a Spaniard, Anastasia Maxarti Ximenes. Among his compositions during his time in Madrid were most of the 555 keyboard sonatas for which he is best known.\nScarlatti befriended the castrato singer Farinelli, a fellow Neapolitan also enjoying royal patronage in Madrid. Musicologist and harpsichordist Ralph Kirkpatrick, who published a biography of Scarlatti in 1953, commented that Farinelli's correspondence provides \"most of the direct information about Scarlatti that has transmitted itself to our day\".\nScarlatti died in Madrid at the age of 71. His residence at 35 Calle de Leganitos is designated with a historical plaque, and his descendants still live in Madrid. He was buried at a convent there, but his grave no longer exists.\nMinor planet 6480 Scarlatti is named in his honour.\nMusic.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOnly a small number of Scarlatti's compositions were published during his lifetime. Scarlatti himself seems to have overseen the publication in 1738 of the most famous collection, his 30 \"Esercizi\" (Exercises). They were well received throughout Europe and were championed by the foremost English writer on music of the eighteenth century, Charles Burney. Burney wrote that the harpsichordist Joseph Kelway was \"head of the Scarlatti sect\", a group of English musicians that championed Scarlatti as early as 1739, also including Thomas Roseingrave.\nThe many sonatas unpublished during Scarlatti's lifetime have appeared in print irregularly in the past two and a half centuries. He has attracted notable admirers, including B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, Pieter-Jan Belder, Johann Sebastian Bach, Muzio Clementi, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Carl Czerny, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Claude Debussy, Emil Gilels, Francis Poulenc, Olivier Messiaen, Enrique Granados, Marc-Andr\u00e9 Hamelin, Vladimir Horowitz, Ivo Pogoreli\u0107, Scott Ross (the first performer to record all 555 sonatas), Heinrich Schenker, Andr\u00e1s Schiff and Dmitri Shostakovich. \nScarlatti's 555 keyboard sonatas are single movements, mostly in binary form, and some in early sonata form, and mostly written for harpsichord or the earliest pianofortes. (There are four for the organ and a few for small instrumental groups). Some display harmonic audacity in their use of discords, and unconventional modulations to remote keys.\nThough Scarlatti wrote over 500 sonatas, there is a wide variety in his works. Some are deeply serious, others are light and almost humorous. Some sound like courtly dances, others like street songs. This ability to cover a wide range of styles and moods is one of the hallmarks of Scarlatti's work. Another stylistic trait of this composer is the ability to mix \u201cdifferent forms or levels of discourse\u201d.\nOther distinctive attributes of his music are:\nKirkpatrick produced an edition of the sonatas in 1953, and the numbering from this edition\u2014the Kk. or K. number\u2014is now nearly always used. Previously, the numbering commonly used was from the 1906 edition compiled by Neapolitan pianist Alessandro Longo (L. numbers). Kirkpatrick's numbering is chronological, while Longo's ordering is a result of his arbitrarily grouping the sonatas into \"suites\". In 1967 the Italian musicologist Giorgio Pestelli published a revised catalogue (using P. numbers), which corrected what he considered to be some anachronisms, and added some sonatas missing from Kirkpatrick's edition. Although the exact composition dates for these surviving sonatas are not known, Kirkpatrick concluded that they might all have been composed late in Scarlatti's career (after 1735), with most of them possibly written after the composer's 67th birthday.\nAside from his many sonatas, Scarlatti composed several operas, cantatas, and liturgical pieces. Well-known works include the \"Stabat Mater\" of 1715, and the \"Salve Regina\" of 1756, which is thought to be his last composition.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44657", "revid": "47120006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44657", "title": "Metis (mythology)", "text": "Oceanid of Greek mythology\nMetis (; ; Modern Greek: \u039c\u03ae\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2, meaning 'Wisdom', 'Skill', or 'Craft'), in ancient Greek religion and mythology, was the pre-Olympian goddess of wisdom, counsel and deep thought, and a member of the Oceanids. She is notable for being the advisor and first wife of Zeus, the king of the gods. She first helped him to free his siblings from their father Cronus's stomach and later helped their daughter Athena to escape from the forehead of Zeus, who swallowed both mother and child after it was foretold that she would bear a son mightier than his father.\nMetis has been applied as a concept of literary criticism, notably by Jean-Pierre Vernant, along with Marcel Detienne.\nFunction.\nBy the era of Greek philosophy in the 5th century BC, Metis had become the first deity of wisdom and deep thought, but her name originally connoted \"magical cunning\" and was as easily equated with the trickster powers of Prometheus as with the \"royal \"metis\"\" of Zeus, who is titled \"Metieta\" () in the Homeric poems. The Stoic commentators allegorised Metis as the embodiment of \"prudence\", \"wisdom\" or \"wise counsel\", in which form she was inherited by the Renaissance.\nThe Greek word \"metis\" meant a quality that combined wisdom and cunning. This quality was considered to be highly admirable, the hero Odysseus being the embodiment of it, for example using such a strategy against Polyphemus, son of Poseidon. In the Classical era, \"metis\" was regarded by Athenians as one of the notable characteristics of the Athenian character.\nMythology.\nHesiod's account.\nMetis was an Oceanid, one of the 3000 daughters of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys, and a sister of the river-gods, which also numbered 3000. Metis gave her cousin Zeus an emetic potion to cause his father Cronus, the supreme ruler of the cosmos, to vomit out his siblings\u00a0\u2013 Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Poseidon\u00a0\u2013 whom their father had swallowed out of fear of being overthrown. After Zeus and his siblings won the Titanomachy, the 10-year war among the Titans and the Olympians, he pursued Metis and they got married.\nMetis was both an indispensable aid and a threat to Zeus. He lay with her, but immediately feared the consequences, for it had been prophesied by Gaia and Uranus that Metis would bear a daughter who would be wiser than her mother, and then a son more powerful than his father, who would eventually overthrow Zeus and become the king of the cosmos in his place. In order to forestall these consequences, Zeus tricked Metis into turning herself into a fly and promptly swallowed her. However, she was already pregnant with their first and only child, Athena, whom Metis raised in Zeus's mind. It is from this position that Metis continues to give Zeus advice as a ruler.\nOnce Athena fully grew up, Metis crafted robes, an armor, a shield, and a spear for her daughter, who banged her spear and shield together in order to give her father a terrible headache. Soon, Zeus could not take his headache anymore and had the smith god Hephaestus\u00a0\u2013 a son of Hera, now Zeus's queen\u00a0\u2013 cut his head open to let out whatever was in there on the river Triton's banks. Athena emerged from Zeus's mind full grown, wearing the armor her mother made for her. She was soon made the goddess of wisdom, warfare, and crafts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But Zeus lay with the fair-cheeked daughter of Ocean and Tethys apart from Hera ... deceiving Metis although she was full wise. But he seized her with his hands and put her in his belly, for fear that she might bring forth something stronger than his thunderbolt: therefore did Zeus, who sits on high and dwells in the aether, swallow her down suddenly. But she straightway conceived Pallas Athena: and the father of men and gods gave her birth by way of his head on the banks of the river Trito. And she remained hidden beneath the inward parts of Zeus, even Metis, Athena's mother, worker of righteousness, who was wiser than gods and mortal men.\nOther versions.\nAccording to a scholiast on the \"Theogony\", Metis had the ability of changing her shape at will. Zeus tricked her and swallowed his pregnant wife when she transformed into a \"\" (\"pikr\u00e0n\"). As Keightley notes, (\"bitter\") makes little or no sense in that context, and it has been variously corrected to (\"mu\u00eean\", meaning \"fly\") or (\"mikr\u00e0n\", meaning \"small thing\") instead.\nAccording to Apollodorus, Metis was raped by Zeus and changed many forms in order to escape him after he pursued her.\nAn alternative version of the same myth makes the Cyclops Brontes rather than Zeus the father of Athena before Metis is swallowed.\nHesiod's account is followed by Acusilaus and the Orphic tradition, which enthroned Metis side by side with Eros as primal cosmogenic forces. Plato makes \"Poros\", or \"creative ingenuity\", a son of Metis.\nAncient legacy.\nThe similarities between Zeus swallowing Metis and Cronus swallowing his children have been noted by several scholars. This also caused some controversy in regard to reproduction myths.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the Aeneid, a pair of sea serpents killed Laoco\u00f6n and his sons when Laoco\u00f6n argued against bringing the Trojan Horse into Troy. Claudius Aelianus in his work \"On the Nature of Animals\" mentions a giant sea centipede, which has a tail that is similar to a crayfish and which moves using numerous feet on each side of its body. Guillaume Rondelet mentions a similar imaginary creature called centipede cetacean in his work \"L'histoire enti\u00e8re des poissons\".\nGermanic Scandinavia.\nIn Nordic mythology, \"J\u00f6rmungandr\" (or \"Midgar\u00f0sormr\") was a sea serpent or worm so long that it encircled the entire world, Midgard. Sea serpents also appear frequently in later Scandinavian folklore, particularly in that of Norway, such as an account that in 1028 AD, Saint Olaf killed a sea serpent in Valldal in Norway, throwing its body onto the mountain Syltefjellet. Marks on the mountain are associated with the legend.\nNatural history.\nAn apparent eye-witness account is given by Aristotle in his work \"Historia Animalium\" on natural history. Strabo makes reference to an eyewitness account of a dead sea creature sighted by Poseidonius on the coast of the northern Levant. He reports the following: \"As for the plains, the first, beginning at the sea, is called Macras, or Macra-Plain. Here, as reported by Poseidonius, was seen the fallen dragon, the corpse of which was about a plethrum [] in length, and so bulky that horsemen standing by it on either side could not see one another, and its jaws were large enough to admit a man on horseback, and each flake of its horny scales exceeded an oblong shield in length.\" The creature was seen sometime between 130 and 51 BC.\nNorway, 16th century.\nSwedish ecclesiastic and writer Olaus Magnus included illustrations of sea serpents and other various marine monsters on his illustrated map, the \"Carta marina\". In his 1555 work \"History of the Northern Peoples\", Olaus gives the following description of a Norwegian sea serpent:\nNorwegian Bishop Erik Pontoppidan (1698\u20131764) did not disbelieve the existence of sea serpents themselves, but doubted they would prey on ships and feed on humans, being more cautious-minded in that respect than Archbishop Olaus (of Uppsala). Nevertheless, a number of reports were made by sailors at the time that sea serpents would destroy ships by wrapping the ship in coils of their body and pulling it underwater. Sailors threatened by a sea serpent were said to have thrown large objects such as paddles or shovels overboard in the path of the serpent, hoping that the serpent would take the object and leave without destroying the ship.\nGreenland in 1734.\nRev. Hans Egede, a Dano-Norwegian clergyman who was an early explorer and surveyor of Greenland, gave an 18th-century description of a sea serpent witnessed by his party. In his journal he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;On the 6th of July, 1734, there appeared a very large and frightful sea monster, which raised itself so high out of the water that its head reached above our main-top (top of the mainmast). It had a long, sharp snout, and spouted water like a whale; and very broad flappers. The body seemed to be covered with scales, and the skin was uneven and wrinkled, and the lower part was formed like a snake. After some time the creature plunged backwards into the water, and then turned its tail up above the surface, a whole ship-length from the head. The following evening we had very bad weather\" \u2015translated in Henry Lee (1883).\nEgede also wrote on the same sea-monster sighting in his book, noting that the beast was spotted at the 64th degree of latitude, and was as thick or \"bulky as the Ship, and three or four times as long\". Egede himself did not supply a sketch in this otherwise well-illustrated book, but the missionary named Bing who was his comrade drew a sketch, which is reproduced in Henry Lee's work.\nBing further described this creature as having reddish eyes, almost burning with fire. This convinced Bishop Pontoppidan that this was different from the type of sea serpent seen by others. From Bing's drawing, Pontoppidan estimated the creature to be considerably shorter than the length of a cable rope, or 100 fathoms () attested by multiple witnesses, and the pair of fins which were attached \"below the waist ()\" in Pontoppidan's view, was another unusual feature.\nLee proposed a rational explanation that this sea-serpent was a misapprehended sighting of what was actually the exposed head and one tentacle of a giant squid (Cf. figure above left).\nNew York exhibition in 1845.\nIn 1845, a long skeleton claimed as belonging to an extinct sea serpent was put on a show in the New York City by Albert C. Koch. The claim was debunked by Prof. Jeffries Wyman, an anatomist who went to see the skeleton for himself. Wyman declared that the skull of the animal had to be mammalian in origin, and that the skeleton was composed of bones of several different animals, including an extinct species of whale.\nPortuguese waters, 1848.\nOn 6 August 1848 Captain McQuhae of and several of his officers and crew (en route to St Helena) saw a sea serpent which was subsequently reported (and debated) in \"The Times\". The vessel sighted what they named as an enormous serpent between the Cape of Good Hope and St Helena. The serpent was witnessed to have been swimming with of its head above the water and they believed that there was another of the creature in the sea. Captain McQuahoe also said that \"[The creature] passed rapidly, but so close under our lee quarter, that had it been a man of my acquaintance I should have easily have recognized his features with the naked eye.\" According to seven members of the crew, it remained in view for around twenty minutes. Another officer wrote that the creature was more of a lizard than a serpent. Evolutionary biologist Gary J. Galbreath contends that what the crew of \"Daedalus\" saw was a sei whale.\nA report was published in the \"Illustrated London News\" on 14 April 1849 of a sighting of a sea serpent off the Portuguese coast by .\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;On the morning of the 31st December, 1848, in lat. 41\u00b0 13'N., and long. 12\u00b0 31'W., being nearly due west of Oporto, I saw a long black creature with a sharp head, moving slowly, I should think about ... its back was about if not more above water; and its head, as near as I could judge, from \u00a0m] ...There was something on its back that appeared like a mane, and, as it moved through the water, kept washing about; but before I could examine it more closely, it was too far astern\u2014\u200a\n\"A giant snake appeared at once from the water - and the largest cetacean a boa constrictor way wrapped twice.

France proposed in a 2016 paper for the \"International Journal of Maritime History\" that a significant number of sea serpent sightings, including nineteenth century accounts of serpents attacking whales, were due to the misidentification of whales entangled in fishing gear and maritime debris.\nIn a 2023 article for \"Fate\", Karl Brandt suggested well-known sea serpent sightings could be explained by harpooned sperm whales held fast to their hunters\u2019 overturned rowboats. The boats would accumulate debris at the surface which could stretch for hundreds of yards while appearing to be propelled through the water by unknown means. The theory was supported by the majority of sightings in Norwegian fjords occurring \u2018during the summer months of June to August when the whales are most-plentiful\u2019.\nDue to their size, elongated bodies, and undulating swimming pattern, Giant oarfish are also presumed to be responsible for some sea serpent sightings.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44660", "revid": "753665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44660", "title": "Arcangelo Corelli", "text": "Italian violinist and composer (1653\u20131713)\nArcangelo Corelli (, , ; ; 17 February 1653 \u2013 8 January 1713) was an Italian composer, musician, and violinist of the middle Baroque era. His music was key in the development of the modern genres of sonata and concerto, in establishing the preeminence of the violin, and as the first coalescing of modern tonality and functional harmony.\nHe was trained in Bologna and Rome and spent most of his career there with the protection of wealthy patrons. Though his entire production is limited to just six published collections \u2013 five of which are trio sonatas or solo and one of concerti grossi \u2014 he achieved great fame and success throughout Europe, in the process crystallizing widely influential musical models.\nHis writing was admired for its balance, refinement, sumptuous and original harmonies, for the richness of the textures, for the majestic effect of the theatricality and for its clear, expressive and melodious polyphony, a perfect quality of Classical ideals, although belonging to the Baroque era and often employing resources typical of this school, such as the exploration of dynamic and expressive contrasts, but always tempered by a great sense of moderation. He was the first to fully apply, with an expressive and structuring purpose, the new tonal system, consolidated after at least two hundred years of experimentation. As a virtuoso violinist he was considered one of the greatest of his generation and contributed, thanks to the development of modern playing techniques and to his many disciples scattered throughout Europe, to place the violin among the most prestigious solo instruments and was also a significant figure in the evolution of the traditional orchestra.\nA dominant figure in Roman musical life and internationally highly regarded, he was desired by many courts and was included in the most prestigious artistic and intellectual society of his time, the Pontifical Academy of Arcadia. He was known in his time as \"the new Orpheus\", \"the prince of musicians\" and other similar adjectives, great folklore was generated around his figure and his fame did not diminish after his death. Even today his work is the subject of a voluminous critical bibliography and his sonatas are still widely used in musical academies as didactic material as well as pieces capable of affirming themselves in today's concert repertoire. His position in the history of Western music is considered crucial, being recognized as one of the greatest masters at the turn of the 17th and 18th century, as well as one of the earliest and greatest classicists.\nLife.\nChildhood.\nBaptismal records indicate that Corelli was born on 17 February 1653 in the small Romagna town of Fusignano, then in the diocese of Ferrara, in the Papal States. His ancestors had been in Fusignano and land-owners there since 1506, when a Corelli moved to the area from Rome. Although apparently prosperous, they were almost certainly not of the nobility, as several fanciful accounts of the composer's genealogy subsequently claimed. Corelli's father, from whom he took the name Arcangelo, died five weeks before the composer's birth. Consequently, he was raised by his mother, Santa (\"n\u00e9e\" Ruffini, or Raffini), alongside four elder siblings, including Ippolito Corelli (1643\u20131727), Domenico Corelli (1647\u20131719) and Giacinto Corelli (1649\u20131719).\nThe wealth of anecdotes and legends attached to Corelli contrast sharply with the paucity of reliable contemporary evidence documenting events in his life. This gap is especially pronounced for his formative years, including his musical education; traditional accounts of a highly idealized childhood have long been debunked.\nMusical education.\nAccording to the poet Giovanni Mario Crescimbeni, who presumably knew the composer well, Corelli initially studied music under a priest in the nearby town of Faenza, and then in Lugo, before moving in 1666 to Bologna. A major centre of musical culture of the time, Bologna had a flourishing school of violinists associated with Ercole Gaibara and his pupils, Giovanni Benvenuti and Leonardo Brugnoli. Reports by later sources link Corelli's musical studies with several master violinists, including Benvenuti, Brugnoli, Bartolomeo Laurenti and Giovanni Battista Bassani. Although historically plausible, these accounts remain largely unconfirmed, as does the claim that the papal contralto Matteo Simonelli first taught him to write in the \"Palestrina style\". A remark Corelli later made to a patron suggests that his musical education focused mainly on the violin.\nChronicles of the Accademia Filarmonica of Bologna indicate that Corelli was accepted as a member by 1670, at the exceptionally young age of seventeen. The credibility of this attribution has been disputed. Although the nickname \"Il Bolognese\" appears on the title-pages of Corelli's first three published sets of works (Opus 1 to 3), the duration of his stay in Bologna remains unclear.\nEarly career.\nAnecdotes of travels outside Italy to France, Germany, and Spain lack any contemporary evidence. For example, the anecdote that Corelli's continental fame stemmed from a trip to Paris at the age of nineteen, where he was chased away by an envious Jean-Baptiste Lully, seems to have originated with Jean-Jacques Rousseau. It was also claimed that Corelli spent time in Germany in the service of Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria (supposedly in 1681), as well as in the house of his friend and fellow violinist-composer Cristiano Farinelli (between 1680 and 1685).\nAlthough it is unclear quite when Corelli arrived in Rome, he was certainly active there by 1675, when \"Arcangelo Bolognese\" (as he was referred to) was engaged to play as one of the supporting violinists in Lenten oratorios at the church of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini, as well as in the French national celebrations held each year on 25 August at San Luigi dei Francesi and during the ordination of a member of the powerful Chigi family at Santi Domenico e Sisto. In August 1676, he was already playing second violin to Carlo Mannelli at San Luigi dei Francesi. Although Rome did not have any permanent orchestra providing stable employment for instrumentalists, Corelli rapidly made a name for himself, playing in a variety of ensembles sponsored by wealthy patrons, such as Cardinal Benedetto Pamphili, for whom he played in Lenten oratorios at San Marcello from 1676 to 1679.\nProfessional success.\nIn 1687 Corelli led the festival performances of music for Queen Christina of Sweden. He was also a favorite of Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, grandnephew of another Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, who in 1689 became Pope Alexander VIII. From 1689 to 1690 he was in Modena. The Duke of Modena was generous to him. In 1706 Corelli was elected a member of the Pontificia Accademia degli Arcadi (the Arcadian Academy of Rome). He received the Arcadian name of Arcomelo Erimanteo.\nIn 1708 he returned to Rome, living in the palace of Cardinal Ottoboni. His visit to Naples, at the invitation of King Philip V, took place in the same year. The style of execution introduced by Corelli and preserved by his pupils, such as Francesco Geminiani, Pietro Locatelli, Pietro Castrucci, Francesco Antonio Bonporti, Giovanni Stefano Carbonelli, Francesco Gasparini, and others, was of vital importance for the development of violin playing. It has been said that the paths of all of the famous violinist-composers of 18th-century Italy led to Arcangelo Corelli, who was their \"iconic point of reference\".\nHowever, Corelli used only a limited portion of his instrument's capabilities. This may be seen from his writings. The parts for violin very rarely proceed above D on the highest string, sometimes reaching the E in fourth position on the highest string. The story has been told and retold that Corelli refused to play a passage that extended to A in altissimo in the overture to Handel's oratorio \"The Triumph of Time and Truth\" (premiered in Rome, 1708).\nNevertheless, his compositions for the instrument mark an epoch in the history of chamber music. His influence was not confined to his own country: his works were key in the development of the music of an entire generation of composers, including Antonio Vivaldi, Georg Friedrich Handel, Johann Sebastian Bach and Fran\u00e7ois Couperin, as well as many others. Bach studied the works of Corelli and based an organ fugue (BWV 579) on Corelli's Opus 3 of 1689. Handel's Opus 6 \"Concerti Grossi\" take Corelli's own older Opus 6 \"Concerti\" as models, rather than the later three-movement Venetian concerto of Antonio Vivaldi favoured by Bach.\nMusical society in Rome also owed much to Corelli. He was received in the highest circles of the aristocracy, and for a long time presided at the celebrated Monday concerts in the palace of Cardinal Ottoboni.\nDeath.\nCorelli died in Rome in possession of a fortune of 120,000 marks and a valuable collection of works of art and fine violins, the only luxury in which he had indulged. He left both to his benefactor and friend, who generously made over the money to Corelli's relatives. Corelli is buried in the Pantheon at Rome.\nWorks.\nContext.\nCorelli's artistic figure flourished at the height of the Baroque, a cultural current characterized by an ornate and luxuriant artistic expressiveness, rich of strong contrasts. His music developed from the Renaissance polyphony, but was characterized by a transition towards greater independence between the voices. New socio-cultural and religious factors, as well as a strong influence of theater and rhetoric, led to the development of a renewed musical language that could better express the spirit of the time, thus developing a wide range of new harmonical, vocal and instrumental techniques. It is the period in which the tonal system is definitively consolidated, abandoning the old modal system, and which has its most typical expression in the writing style called continuo or figured bass, in which the bass line and the top line are written in full, leaving the execution of the harmonic filling attributed to the other parts to the discretion of the performer, indicated synthetically by the author by numbers. The great importance attributed to the superior voice, which relegated the other parts to a subordinate role, brought out the figure of the virtuoso soloist.\nThe tempered tunings were also introduced, the melody often had popular inspiration and the dissonances began to be used as an expressive resource. Polyphony remained omnipresent especially in sacred music, generally more conservative, but the complexity that characterized it in previous centuries, which often made the sung texts incomprehensible, was abandoned in favor of a much clearer and simplified counterpoint, in which primacy was often given to the loudest voice. Furthermore, in the field of symbolism and language, the development of the theory of affects was of great importance, in which figures, melodies, tones and specific standardized technical resources became a musical lexicon at the service of expression. Such resources were very common in opera, the most popular and influential genre of the time, also exerting a decisive influence on the direction of instrumental music, a language that Corelli contributed significantly to articulate and affirm. At a formal level, the Baroque consolidated the forms of the suite and the sonata into multiple movements, which gave rise to the sonata da chiesa, the sonata da camera, to the sonata, to the concerto grosso, to the solo concerto and, later, to the symphony. In general, the changes introduced by the Baroque constituted a revolution in the history of music, perhaps as important as those promoted by the emergence of \"ars nova\" in the 14th century and avant-garde music in the 20th century.\nBologna, where Corelli originally studied, with its 60,000 inhabitants, was the second most important city in the Papal State, seat of the oldest university in the world and center of an intense cultural and artistic life. There were several large churches that maintained permanent orchestras, choirs and schools, three large theaters hosted dramatic and operatic performances, several publishing houses published sheet music, and there were at least half a dozen academies maintained by the nobility and higher clergy in their buildings. All of this defined trends and aesthetic canons, some dedicated exclusively to music, among which the most famous was the Accademia Filarmonica, founded in 1666 by Count Vincenzo Maria Carrati. An illustrious violin school was formed in this city, founded by Ercole Gaibara, whose principles were assimilated by Corelli.\nRome, on the other hand, had much greater traditions, wealth, and importance on several levels, starting with being the seat of Catholicism. Furthermore, it was a cosmopolitan capital that welcomed artists from all over Europe, eager to establish themselves in such rich, varied and influential settings, where the great patrons of the Church and the aristocracy challenged each other by organizing sumptuous presentations and promoting numerous artists. However, few churches and brotherhoods had stable musical bodies and there was a great exchange of professionals between one celebration and another. Unlike Bologna, in Rome the Church had a decisive influence on cultural life, and the guidelines in this regard varied according to the preferences of each pontiff. Pope Clement IX, for example, was himself a librettist of operas and oratorios and promoted secular music, and Corelli apparently found himself in this environment without any difficulty, although it is not known who introduced him to it. In any case, he soon gained the favor of patrons who were among the city's most prominent.\nThe violinist.\nAs already mentioned, Corelli learned the fundamentals of violin technique in Bologna, and as a disciple of the virtuosos Giovanni Benvenuti and Leonardo Brugnoli, he followed the lines set by Ercole Gaibara, considered the progenitor of the Bolognese school. He later taught many students and spawned his own school, but despite his fame in this field, surprisingly few, inaccurate, descriptions of his technique survive, generating considerable controversy among critics, a shortcoming that is compounded by the fact that he did not write any manual or treatise about the topic. At the time there were several violin schools in Italy, which proposed different playing methods and even ways in which the player should hold the violin. There is considerable iconography describing these differences, where violinists rest the instrument under the chin, on the shoulder or against the chest, at different angles. Naturally, these differences involved different left hand and bow techniques and, to some extent, defined the style and complexity of the music they could perform.\nDuring the 18th century he was considered a great virtuoso, but critics of the 20th century have sometimes doubted the ancient testimonies. Boyden, for example, stated that \"Corelli cannot claim a prominent place in the history of violin technique\"; Pincherle considered him \"inferior to his German and even Italian contemporaries in terms of pure technique\", and McVeigh said that he was \"certainly not one of the great virtuosos of his time\". However, according to Riedo, such opinions are based on what can be deduced from the technical requirements contained in his compositions, but this method is not entirely faithful to reality, since the score only offers a vague idea of what could be a live performance, also observing that the style developed by Corelli was characterized more by sobriety and singability than by extravagance. Furthermore, his compositions, in their published version, are addressed above all to a heterogeneous audience and not only to specialists and virtuosos. At the same time, his works cannot be exemplary of his ability to interpret works by other authors, where he may have taken a different approach. The failures of the Naples recital and the confrontation with Handel in Rome, where he supposedly claimed to have no experience in French technique, are often cited as evidence supporting his limited violin technique, although they are not firmly demonstrated.\nAccording to Riedo's research, which summarizes studies on this aspect, Corelli probably held the violin against his chest and projected it forward; this possibility is supported by engravings and drawings, as well as written sources, including descriptions of the performances of other violinists who had been his students or were influenced by him. This position was very common before his time, was dominant in the Rome of his time and remained common until the 19th century. Francesco Geminiani, who was probably his student, in his \"The Art of Playing the Violin\" (1751) wrote that \"the violin should be held just below the clavicle, inclining the right side slightly downward, so so it is not necessary to bend too much when playing the fourth string.\" Walls claimed that almost no virtuoso of the first half of the 18th century took a different stance. It provided the performer with an elegant attitude, in Corelli's case also important for being a patrician, but it slightly impaired the execution of the highest notes of the fourth string. Corelli's music rarely requires positions higher than the third.\nGeminiani, who was also a virtuoso, gave voice to a very current vision of what is expected from a good violinist: \"The intention of music is not only to please the ear, but to express feelings, touch the imagination, influence the mind, and dominate the passions. The art of playing the violin consists in giving the instrument a sound that rivals the most perfect human voice, and in executing each piece with accuracy, decorum, delicacy and expression according to the true intention of the music.\" In Riedo's words, \"Geminiani's ideological and aesthetic views seem to correspond exactly to Corelli's compositions: he enhanced the textures, without acrobatic passages with extreme changes of position and without virtuoso effects. The positions of Boyden, Pincherle and McVeigh must be reconsidered, since this type of acrobatic virtuosity does not seem to have been Corelli's goal.\" Contemporary descriptions report that his performances were \"erudite, elegant and pathetic, and his sound firm and uniform.\" Bremner wrote in 1777: \"I was informed that Corelli would not accept into his orchestra any violinist who could not, with a bow, create a uniform and powerful sound, like that of an organ, by playing two strings at the same time, and maintain it for at least minus ten seconds.\" This suggests that his main concern was the mastery of bow technique, responsible for the overall sound produced and for the nuances and subtleties of dynamics and phrasing, which also coincides with claims of the time about Corelli's ability to express in the violin the most diverse emotions in their fullness, making his instrument \"speak\" as if it were a human voice.\nAmong the advances that he promoted in the technique are the more intense exploration of double strings (including figurations in a pedal note), the G string (little used until then), harmonics, arpeggios, and tremolo, of rubato, of staccato, of scordatura, of fast figurations in thirds, of chords of more than two notes and was the main proponent of the bariolage technique. Although Corelli did not write anything about it, the treatises published by Geminiani, Francesco Galeazzi and others influenced by him probably faithfully reflect the master's principles. His performances in various fields related to the violin \u2013 virtuoso, teacher and composer \u2013 have left an indelible mark on the history of this instrument and have laid the foundations of its modern technique.\nIt is known that he had many students, among them: Matteo Fornari, Giovanni Battista Somis, Pietro Castrucci, Giovanni Stefano Carbonelli, Francesco Gasparini, Jean-Baptiste Anet, Georg Muffat and Francesco Geminiani.\nThe conductor.\nLittle is known about his performances as a conductor, except that he successfully played this role for many years at the head of the orchestras of the church of San Luis and the Academy of Drawing Arts and of countless groups formed for specific occasions, such as recitals in the private academies of the aristocracy, civic festivals and diplomatic receptions. The recognition he received was always very generous, and he was praised above all for the great discipline of the musicians he directed, always obtaining vigorous performances, with great precision in the attack of the notes and a powerful overall effect. Geminiani reported that \"Corelli felt it was essential that the entire orchestra move the bows at exactly the same time: all up, all down, so that in rehearsals prior to performances, he could stop the music if he saw an out-of-range bow position\".\nCorelli was of vital importance in the process of transformation of the traditional orchestra. In the previous generation, ensembles were quite small even for opera performances and only on very exceptional occasions were large groups recruited, especially for open-air festivals. The orchestra of San Luigi, for example, did not exceed twenty members, even on prestigious occasions, and most of the time it consisted of about ten or fifteen members.\nThanks to the legacy of ancient polyphonic practices, ensembles made use of various instruments of balanced proportions, grouped in \"choirs\", each composed of several types of instruments. Corelli's generation began to change this balance of forces towards an increasing predominance of the string section, with an emphasis on the violins, significantly expanding the number of musicians, grouping the instruments into homogeneous sections and separating the singers from the orchestra. . Its spatial arrangement also changed, adopting a distribution that favored the typical language of the Grosso concert, with a small solo ensemble, the \"concertino\", separated from the large \"ripieno\" group.\nIn addition to conducting and being a concertmaster at the same time, Corelli was responsible for recruiting musicians to form occasional orchestras, paid salaries, and performed all the functions of a modern event manager. On some occasions he employed an immense number of musicians, up to 150, far above all the standards of his time. According to Crescimbeni's testimony, \"he was the first to introduce ensembles in Rome with such a number of instruments and such diversity that it was almost impossible to believe that he could make them play all together without fear of confusion, especially since he combined wind instruments with strings, and the total very often exceeded one hundred elements.\" Although the number of musicians varied greatly in each performance, the balance of Corelli's orchestras was constant, with at least half of the musicians playing violins and a quarter occupied with cellos, violons and double basses. The remaining fraction was filled with a varied instrumentation of violas, wind instruments, lutes, theorbos, organs, harpsichords and others, and depended largely on the character of the music of the occasion. His intense activity at different levels in the field of orchestral music dominated the Roman scene and his role as organizer, dynamizer and standard bearer can be compared to that of Jean-Baptiste Lully at the court of Louis XIV. By extension, one could say that all the Roman orchestras between 1660 and 1713 were \u201cCorelli's orchestra.\"\nThe composer.\nDespite the typically Baroque love for the extravagant, the bizarre, the asymmetrical and the dramatic, Corelli's production deviates from this scheme, favoring the classical principles of sobriety, symmetry, rationality, balanced and expressive moderation, as well as formal perfection, appreciated several times by coeval and contemporary critics, formulating an aesthetic that is among the beginners of the neoclassical school of music with considerable economy of means. In the description of the \"Larousse Encyclopedia of Music\", \"no doubt others before him showed more originality, but none in his day showed a more noble interest in balance and order, or in formal perfection and meaning. Despite his Bolognese training, he embodies the classical era of Italian music, thanks above all to the Roman tradition. [...] Although he did not invent the forms he used, Corelli gave them a nobility and perfection that make him one of the greatest classicists\".\nCorelli's works were the result of long and thoughtful planning, and were published only after careful and multiple revisions. His latest collection seems to have taken more than thirty years to complete, and a statement he left in a letter of 1708 attests his insecurity: \"After so many and extensive revisions I have rarely felt the confidence to deliver to the public the few compositions that I sent it to the press\". Such a rigorous, rationally and organized method, and such a strong yearning for ideal perfection, are other characteristics that make him a classic in opposition to the wild, asymmetrical, irregular and improvisational spirit of the most typical Baroque. For Franco Piperno, \"his printed work has an exceptionally well-kept and cohesive structure, deliberately designed to be didactic, modeling and monumental. It is no coincidence that one of the figures on the title page of his \"Opera Terza\" is written \"to posterity\", that is, as posterity would see him: as an authority on composition, execution and pedagogy, a source of full of potential ideas\". He was rigid also in the choice of genres to deal with: the trio sonata, the sonata for solo instrument and the concerto grosso. All his production is for strings, with continuo accompaniment, which could be performed by a variable combination of organ, harpsichord, lutes or theorbos. He left no works for voice, but his compositions reveal a strong influence of vocal music in their expressiveness, as well as in the treatment of polyphony.\nIn his time, the circle of fifths established itself as the main driver of chord progressions and, according to Richard Taruskin, Corelli practiced, more than anyone of his generation, new concepts with expressive, dynamic and structural purposes, which was fundamental for the sedimentation of the tonal system. Manfred Bukofzer, likewise, states that \"Arcangelo Corelli deserves credit for the full realization of tonality in the field of instrumental music. His works happily usher in the late Baroque period. [...] Although closely linked to counterpoint tradition of the ancient Bolognese school, Corelli handled the new language with impressive confidence. On the other hand, chromatisms are rare in his music, but dissonances are relatively common and used as an expressive element, although they are always well prepared and well resolved. Critics have also highlighted the harmonious and balanced integration between polyphonic and homophonic elements, with polyphony which unfolds freely within a tonal structure. In his work there is an abundance of polyphonic expressive forms, the fugati, simple counterpoints and imitative writings, with themes that are repeated in succession by the various voices alternately, usually also called fugues, but in his style authentic fugues are rare, as his development differs from conventional models because of form, exhibiting a wide variety of solutions. According to Pincherle, one of the most significant aspects of Corelli's genius lies in the coordinated movement of these voices that intertwine, avoid each other and find themselves in such a way as to develop ever-changing motifs, establishing a unity through the motivic kinship of the different movements, a method which Fausto Torrefranca compared to the creation of \"a frieze that runs along the walls and facades of a temple\".\nAmong his influences are mainly the masters of the Bolognese school, such as Giovanni Benvenuti, Leonardo Brugnoli and Giovanni Battista Bassani. Also evident is the influence of Jean-Baptiste Lully, attested by Francesco Geminiani, as well as by the Venetian school, in particular Francesco Cavalli, Antonio Cesti and Giovanni Legrenzi. George J. Buelow, further, attests that the influence of Palestrina on the development of the polyphonic style of his music has been largely ignored, an influence received mainly through his teacher Simonelli, who was a singer of the Sistine Chapel, where Palestrina's work was one of the highlights of the repertoire.\nCorelli's style has long been praised as paradigmatic for its clarity and its sober and expressive melodism, the quintessence of Arcadian good taste. Georg Friedrich Handel, Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi, Fran\u00e7ois Couperin, Giuseppe Torelli, Georg Muffat, Georg Philipp Telemann, Giuseppe Valentini, Benedetto Marcello, Pietro Locatelli, Giuseppe Sammartini, Francesco Geminiani and countless other musicians were inspired by the Corellian model in producing their orchestral music. In Rome its influence was so overwhelming that no composer of the next generation could completely avoid it. Along with Torelli and Vivaldi, Corelli was one of the key figures in establishing the concerto as a genre whose popularity still persists today. One American admirer was President Thomas Jefferson who regularly played the violin, and cataloged four of Corelli's sonatas in the library at Monticello.\nAn 1827 music dictionary still echoed what Burney had said more than thirty years earlier: \"Corelli's concerts have withstood all the onslaught of time and fashion, more firmly than his other works. Harmony is so pure, the parts so clearly, judiciously and ingeniously arranged, and the overall effect, played by a large orchestra, is so majestic, solemn and sublime, that they disarm any criticism and make one forget everything that has ever been composed in the same genre\". In the opinion of Michael Talbot, writing for \"The Cambridge Companion to the Concerto\", it is difficult to explain the enduring popularity of this collection, considering the simplicity not the cause of its popularity, but only a precondition. He continues stating:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Corelli's genius lies rather in his ability to create satisfying forms without resorting to fixed formulas, in his ability to combine contrasting ideas [...], in his original inventiveness for atmospheres, and in his moments \u2013 more numerous than expected \u2013 of harmonic audacity. Among the unforgettable passages of the Concerti grossi are the poignant suspensions and enchanting octave doublings in the second adagio of the fourth concert and the magical change of key from minor to major at the beginning of the Pastorale that concludes the eighth concerto, an optional movement that was composed to be performed on Christmas Eve.\nCorelli composed 48 trio sonatas, 12 violin and continuo sonatas, and 12 concerti grossi.\nSix sets of twelve compositions, published between 1888 and 1891 by Chrysander, are authentically ascribed to Corelli, together with a few other works.\nLegacy.\nHis concerti grossi have often been popular in Western culture. For example, a portion of the \"Christmas Concerto\", Op.\u00a06 No.\u00a08, is in the soundtrack of the film \"\", and Corelli's Op. 6 No. 2 also provided the theme for Sir Michael Tippett's \"Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli\".

{"id": "44661", "revid": "49940409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44661", "title": "East Slavs", "text": "Subgroup of Slavic peoples\nThe East Slavs are the most populous subgroup of the Slavs. They speak the East Slavic languages, and formed the majority of the population of the medieval state Kievan Rus', which they consider their cultural ancestor. Belarusians, Russians and Ukrainians are the existing East Slavic groups. Rusyns are sometimes considered a separate nation, though they are often considered a subgroup of Ukrainians.\nHistory.\nSources.\nResearchers know relatively little about the Eastern Slavs prior to approximately 859 AD when the first events recorded in the \"Primary Chronicle\" occurred. The Eastern Slavs of these early times apparently lacked a written language. The few known facts come from archaeological digs, foreign travellers' accounts of the Rus' land, and linguistic comparative analyses of Slavic languages.\nVery few native Rus' documents dating before the 11th century (none before the 10th century) have survived. The earliest major manuscript with information on Rus' history, the \"Primary Chronicle\", dates from the late 11th and early 12th centuries. It lists twelve Slavic tribal unions which, by the 10th century, had settled in the later territory of the Kievan Rus between the Western Bug, the Dniepr and the Black Sea: the \"Polans\", \"Drevlyans\", \"Dregovichs\", \"Radimichs\", \"Vyatichs\", \"Krivichs\", \"Slovens\", \"Dulebes\" (later known as Volhynians and Buzhans), \"White Croats\", \"Severians\", \"Ulichs\", and \"Tivertsi\".\nMigration.\nThere is no consensus among scholars as to the urheimat of the Slavs. In the first millennium AD, Slavic settlers are likely to have been in contact with other ethnic groups who moved across the Eastern European Plain during the Migration Period. Between the first and ninth centuries, the Sarmatians, Huns, Alans, Avars, Bulgars, and Magyars passed through the Pontic steppe in their westward migrations. Although some of them could have subjugated the region's Slavs, these foreign tribes left little trace in the Slavic lands. The Early Middle Ages also saw Slavic expansion as an agriculturist and beekeeper, hunter, fisher, herder, and trapper people. By the 8th century, the Slavs were the dominant ethnic group on the East European Plain.\nBy 600 AD, the Slavs had split linguistically into southern, western, and eastern branches. The East Slavs practiced \"slash-and-burn\" agricultural methods which took advantage of the extensive forests in which they settled. This method of agriculture involved clearing tracts of forest with fire, cultivating it and then moving on after a few years. Slash and burn agriculture requires frequent movement because soil cultivated in this manner only yields good harvests for a few years before exhausting itself, and the reliance on slash and burn agriculture by the East Slavs explains their rapid spread through eastern Europe. The East Slavs flooded Eastern Europe in two streams. One group of tribes settled along the Dnieper river in what is now Ukraine and Belarus to the North; they then spread northward to the northern Volga valley, east of modern-day Moscow and westward to the basins of the northern Dniester and the Southern Buh rivers in present-day Ukraine and southern Ukraine.\nAnother group of East Slavs moved to the northeast, where they encountered the Varangians of the Rus' Khaganate and established an important regional centre of Novgorod for protection. The same Slavic population also settled the present-day Tver Oblast and the region of Beloozero. Having reached the lands of the Merya near Rostov, they linked up with the Dnieper group of Slavic migrants.\nPre-Kievan period.\nAccording to archeology, the Prague, Korchak, Penkova, Kolochin, and Kyiv cultures are classified as early Slavic. The earliest of which, Kyiv, from the 2nd\u20133rd centuries AD. e. was the northern neighbor of the more developed and multi-ethnic Chernyakhov culture, associated with another early group of slavs(Veneti/Venedi/Venedae?). Rare, few and short-lived settlements of the Slavs were located \"in unusual topographic conditions: in low places, often now flooded during floods\".\nEastern Slavs, who found themselves as a result of migrations of the 4th\u20135th centuries. in the basins of lakes Chudskoye and Ilmen, formed the . This culture was strongly influenced by the autochthonous Finno-Ugric and Baltic peoples, from whom it adopted a specific burial rite and some features of ceramics, but in general, the way of life of the Eastern Slavs changed little. By the 5th century on the site of the Kyiv culture and in other regions to the north, east, west and south of it, a number of related cultures arise, such as Korchak, Kolochin, etc. Among the East Slavs, fortified cities appeared in northern Ukraine and in southern Belarus and southwest Russia; the Ilmen Slovenes and the Krivichs did not reach Lake Ladoga and the northern reaches of the Baltic Sea until the 7th century AD. (based on archaeological data in the town on Mayat river). The first settlements near the Polans and Severians arose in the region of Kyiv and Chernigov already by the 7th\u20138th centuries, which indicates at least a partial rejection of the previous strategy of scattered and secretive living among the forests. This is also evidenced by the fact that in the VIII-IX centuries. in all other East Slavic lands there were no more than two dozen cities, while only on the Left Bank of the Dnieper there were about a hundred of them.\nThe foundation of the main Slavic city of this region, Novgorod, is attributed by the letopis to 862. In the same era, settlements appeared on the territories of other East Slavic tribes (see ). So, the northerners who lived on the territory of modern Voronezh, Belgorod and Kursk regions, along with settlements in the 9th\u201310th centuries. built fortified settlements, mainly at the confluence of large rivers (see Romensko-Borshchiv culture). In the 10th century, a fortress appeared not far from the city of Smolensk that arose later (the Gnezdovsky archaeological complex).\nSomewhat apart are the early East Slavic settlements, the creation of which is attributed to the tribal unions of Dulebs and Antes. Archaeologically, they are represented by the Prague-Korchak and Penkov cultures, respectively. A number of such settlements of the Prague-Korchak (Zimino, Lezhnitsa, Khotomel, Babka, Khilchitsy, ) and Penkovo (Selishte, Pastyrskoe) cultures existed in the 6th\u20137th centuries. on a vast territory from the borders of modern Poland and Romania to the Dnieper. The Prague-Korchak settlements were a site surrounded by a wooden wall with one building, which was part of the common wall of the settlement. They did not have agricultural tools, and the settlements, apparently, were built to collect and accommodate a military detachment. Penkovsky settlements could have up to two dozen buildings inside the walls and were large trade, craft and administrative centers for their time. The center of the territory controlled by the dulebs (Zimino, Lezhnitsa) was in the basin of the Western Bug; the geographical center of the Penkovo culture falls on the Dnieper region, but the main fortress of the Antes (Selishte) was located in the western part of this area, near the borders of Byzantine Empire (in modern Moldova), on which they made military campaigns. The early Slavic settlements were destroyed by the Avars in the 7th century, after which they were not built until the 10th century.\nPost-Kievan period.\nThe disintegration, or parcelling of the polity of Kievan Rus' in the 11th century resulted in considerable population shifts and a political, social, and economic regrouping. The resultant effect of these forces coalescing was the marked emergence of new peoples. While these processes began long before the fall of Kiev, its fall expedited these gradual developments into a significant linguistic and ethnic differentiation among the Rus' people into Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Russians. All of this was emphasized by the subsequent polities these groups migrated into: southwestern and western Rus', where the Ruthenian and later Ukrainian and Belarusian identities developed, was subject to Lithuanian and later Polish influence; whereas the Russian ethnic identity developed in the Muscovite northeast and the Novgorodian north.\nModern East Slavs.\nModern East Slavic peoples and ethnic/subethnic groups include:\nGenetics.\nAccording to Y chromosome, mDNA and autosomal marker CCR5de132, East Slavs and West Slavs are genetically very similar, which is consistent with the proximity of their languages, demonstrating significant differences from the neighboring Finno-Ugric, Turkic and North Caucasian peoples all the way from west to east; such genetic homogeneity is somewhat unusual for genetics given such a wide dispersal of Slavic populations, especially Russians. \nTogether, they form the basis of the \"\"East European\" gene cluster, which also includes Balts, some Balkan peoples. Genetic research has shown that the genomes of East Slavs are homogenous and contrary to popular belief, unaffected by Turkic or Mongol influences.\nOnly the Northern Russians among the East and West Slavs belong to a different, \"Northern European\"\" genetic cluster, along with the Balts, Germanic and Baltic Finnic peoples (Northern Russian populations are very similar to the Balts).\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The program had wide-ranging social, cultural, economic, and demographic effects, although the contribution of one-child restrictions to the broader program has been the subject of controversy. Its efficacy in reducing birth rates and defensibility from a human rights perspective have been subjects of controversy.\nChina's family planning policies began to be shaped by fears of overpopulation in the 1970s, and officials raised the age of marriage and called for fewer and more broadly spaced births. A near-universal one-child limit was imposed in 1980 and written into the country's constitution in 1982. Numerous exceptions were established over time, and by 1984, only about 35.4% of the population was subject to the original restriction of the policy.167 In the mid-1980s, rural parents were allowed to have a second child if the first was a daughter. It also allowed exceptions for some other groups, including ethnic minorities under 10 million people. In 2015, the government raised the limit to two children, and in May 2021 to three. In July 2021, it removed all limits, shortly after implementing financial incentives to encourage individuals to have additional children.\nImplementation of the policy was handled at the national level primarily by the National Population and Family Planning Commission and at the provincial and local level by specialized commissions. Officials used pervasive propaganda campaigns to promote the program and encourage compliance. The strictness with which it was enforced varied by period, region, and social status. In some cases, women were forced to use contraception, receive abortions, and undergo sterilization. Families who violated the policy faced large fines and other penalties.\nThe population control program had wide-ranging social effects, particularly for Chinese women. Patriarchal attitudes and a cultural preference for sons led to the abandonment of unwanted infant girls, some of whom died and others of whom were adopted abroad. Over time, this skewed the country's sex ratio toward men and created a generation of \"missing women\". However, the policy also resulted in greater workforce participation by women who would otherwise have been occupied with childrearing, and some girls received greater familial investment in their education.\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) credits the program with contributing to the country's economic ascendancy and says that it prevented 400\u00a0million births, although some scholars dispute that estimate. Some have also questioned whether the drop in birth rate was caused more by other factors unrelated to the policy. In the West, the policy has been widely criticized for human rights violations and other negative effects.\nBackground.\nSince the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, socialist construction was the utmost mission the state needed to accomplish. Top state leaders believed that a bigger population would effectively contribute to the national projects.\nDuring Mao Zedong's leadership in China, the birth rate fell from 37 per thousand to 20 per thousand. Infant mortality declined from 227 per thousand births in 1949 to 53 per thousand in 1981, and life expectancy dramatically increased from around 35 years in 1948 to 66 years in 1976. Until the 1960s, the government mostly encouraged families to have as many children as possible, especially during the Great Leap Forward, because of Mao's belief that population growth empowered the country, preventing the emergence of family planning programs earlier in China's development. The state tried to incentivize more childbirths during that time with a variety of policies, such as the \"Mother Heroine\" award, a programme inspired by a similar policy in the Soviet Union. As a result, the population grew from around 540million in 1949 to 969million in 1979, corresponding to an average annual growth rate of about 1.97% per year. (If the same rate had continued unabated from 1979 through 2025, China's population in 2025 would be on the order of 2.4 billion people.) Beginning in 1970, citizens were encouraged to marry at later ages and many were limited to have only two children.\nAlthough China's fertility rate plummeted faster than anywhere else in the world during the 1970s under these restrictions, the Chinese government thought it was still too high, influenced by the global debate over a possible overpopulation crisis suggested by organizations such as the Club of Rome and the Sierra Club. The fertility rate dropped from 5.9 in the 1950s to 4.0 in the 1970s. Yet, the population still grew at a significant rate. There were approximately 541,670,000 people in China in the year 1949. The number then went up to 806,710,000 in 1969.\nIn the early 1970s, the state introduced a set of birth planning policies. It mainly called for later childbearing, longer time spans between having new children, and giving birth to fewer children.57 Men were encouraged to marry at age 25 or later, and women were encouraged to marry at age 23 or later.57The authorities began encouraging one-child families in 1978, and in 1979 announced that they intended to advocate for one-child families. Ma Yinchu, a founder of China's population planning theory, was also an author of the policy. In the late spring of 1979, Chen Yun became the first senior leader to propose the one-child policy. On 1 June 1979, Chen said that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Comrade Xiannian proposed to me planning \"better one, at most two\". I'd say be stricter, stipulating that \"only one is allowed\". Prepare to be criticized by others for cutting off the offspring. But if we don't do it, the future looks grim.\nDeng Xiaoping, then paramount leader of China, supported the policy, along with other senior leaders including Hua Guofeng and Li Xiannian. On 15 October 1979, Deng met a British delegation led by Felix Greene in Beijing, saying that \"we encourage one child per couple. We give economic rewards to those who promise to give birth to only one child.\"\nFormulation of the policy.\nIn 1980, the central government organized a meeting in Chengdu to discuss the speed and scope of one-child restrictions. The notable aerospace engineer Song Jian was a participant at the Chengdu meeting. He had previously read two influential books about population concerns, \"The Limits to Growth\" and \"A Blueprint for Survival\", while visiting Europe in 1980. Along with several associates, Song determined that the ideal population of China was 700million, and that a universal one-child policy for all would be required to meet that goal. If fertility rates remained constant at 3 births per woman, China's population would surpass 3 billion by 2060 and 4 billion by 2080. In spite of some criticism inside the CCP, the \"family planning policy\" was formally implemented as a temporary measure on 18 September 1980. The plan called for families to have one child each in order to curb a then-surging population and alleviate social, economic, and environmental problems in China.\n\"Virtual\" population crisis.\nDespite the legitimate ongoing rapid growth of China's population and the evident effects it brought to society, using the term \"population crisis\" to describe the situation is disputed. Scholars including Susan Greenhalgh argue that the state intentionally created a virtual population crisis in order to serve political ends. According to state promotions, the looming overpopulation crisis would ruin the national agenda of achieving \"China's socialist modernization\", which includes industry, agriculture, national defense, and technology.\nChina's attitude towards population control on the global stage in international forums evidenced an ambiguous stance on the nature of the crisis. In the mid-1960s, when global movements for birth control emerged, Chinese delegates expressed their opposition toward population control. In the first UN-organized World Population Conference held in Bucharest in 1974, they claimed that it was an imperialist agenda that Western countries imposed on Third World countries, and that population was not a determining factor of economic growth and a country's well-being. Yet, in the domestic setting the state leaders were already wary of the perceived \"population crisis\" that was thought to endanger the modernization of China.\nIt is also suggested that mathematical terms, graphs, and tables were utilized to form a convincing narrative that presents the urgency of the population problem as well as justifies the necessity of mandatory birth control across the nation. Due to the previous traumas of the Cultural Revolution, public and top state leaders turned to the charisma of science, and sometimes blindly worshipped it as the solution to every problem. As a result, any proposal that was veiled and decorated by the so-called scientific back-ups would be highly considered by both the people and the state.\nArguments started to come out in 1979 suggesting that the excessively rapid population growth was sabotaging the economy and destroying the environment, and essentially preventing China from being a rightful member of the global world. Skillful and deliberate comparisons were made with developed and industrialized countries such as the United States, Japan, and France. Under such a comparison, China's relatively low income per capita was attributed directly to population growth and no other factors. Though the data is truthful, its arrangement and presentation to readers gave a single message determined by the state: that the population problem is a national catastrophe and immediate remedy is desperately needed.\nChinese population science.\nChina was deprived of data, skills, and state support to conduct population studies. Due to Mao's ambivalent attitude toward the population issue, population studies were abolished in the late 1950s. After Mao's death, family planning became a critical component and premise for reaching China's national goal: that is, to achieve \"China's socialist modernization,\" which includes modernizing industry, agriculture, national defence, and technology. Therefore, at this point, population science was closely related and tied with state politics. There was a perceived need to redefine population as a domain of science, identify the population problem in China, and propose a solution to it. Such efforts included many groups of people with diverse backgrounds. Among these experts, two groups held the most influence in defining the population problem and providing a solution to it. They were a group of scientists led by Liu Zheng, and another group led by Song Jian. Liu's group mainly came from a social science background, while Song's group came from natural science background.\nSocial scientists.\nSocial scientists involved in this discussion in the mid-1970s, including Liu Zheng, Wu Cangping, Lin Fude, and Zha Ruichuan, prioritized the Marxist formulation of the population problem. They saw the problem as an \"imbalance between economic and demographic growth\", and wished to design a reasonable policy that considered the social consequences. These scientists came from the fields of social science, statistics, genetics, history, and many others. However, they had limited access to resources compared to the natural scientists who became involved in population policy making in 1978. Since population studies were forbidden from the 1950s until 1979, population science had made no progress between these two decades.\nNatural scientists.\nNatural scientists were interested in using control theory and applying it to the actual policy. The leader of the group, Song Jian, was a control theorist at the Ministry of Aerospace Industry. He was known for his career in missile science. Yu Jingyuan and Li Guangyuan were trained engineers in the field of cybernetics. Compared to the social scientists, this group of natural scientists had numerous advantages. They were politically protected during the Maoist period due to their importance in national defense and technology. They also had access to Western science. Eventually, they took an important role in examining the population model as well as designing the details of one-child policies. After quantitative research and analysis, they showed the top state leaders that the only solution would be a policy \"to encourage all couples to have only one child, regardless of the costs to individuals and society\".\nAlthough Greenhalgh claims that Song Jian was the central architect of the one-child policy and that he \"hijacked\" the population policy making process, that claim has been refuted by several leading scholars, including Liang Zhongtang, a leading internal critic of one-child restrictions and an eye-witness at the discussions in Chengdu. In the words of Wang et al., \"the idea of the one-child policy came from leaders within the Party, not from scientists who offered evidence to support it.\" Central officials had already decided in 1979 to advocate for one-child restrictions before knowing of Song's work and, upon learning of his work in 1980, already seemed sympathetic to his position.\nHistory.\nThe one-child policy was originally designed to be a \"One-Generation Policy\". It was enforced at the provincial level and enforcement varied; some provinces had more relaxed restrictions. The one-child limit was most strictly enforced in densely populated urban areas. When this policy was first introduced, 6.1 million families that had already given birth to a child were given \"One Child Honorary Certificates\". This was a pledge they had to make to ensure they would not have more children.\nBeginning in 1980, the official policy granted local officials the flexibility to make exceptions and allow second children in the case of \"practical difficulties\" (such as cases in which the father was a disabled serviceman) or when both parents were single children, and some provinces had other exemptions worked into their policies as well. In most areas, families were allowed to apply to have a second child if their first-born was a daughter. By 1984, only approximately 35.4% of the population fell within the policy's original restriction.167\nFurthermore, families with children with disabilities have different policies and families whose first child suffers from physical disability, mental illness, or intellectual disability were allowed to have more children. However, second children were sometimes subject to birth spacing (usually three or four years). Children born overseas were not counted under the policy if they did not obtain Chinese citizenship. Chinese citizens returning from abroad were allowed to have a second child. Sichuan province allowed exemptions for couples of certain backgrounds. By one estimate there were at least 22 ways in which parents could qualify for exceptions to the law towards the end of the one-child policy's existence.\nIn 1991, the central government made local governments directly responsible for family planning goals.77 Also in the early 1990s, experts from leading population-research institutes began appealing to policymakers to relax or end the one-child policy.79\nAs of 2007, only 36% of the population were subjected to a strict one-child limit. 53% were permitted to have a second child if their first was a daughter; 9.6% of Chinese couples were permitted two children regardless of their gender; and 1.6% \u2013 mainly Tibetans \u2013 had no limit at all.\nFollowing the devastating 2008 Sichuan earthquake, a new exception to the regulations was announced in Sichuan for parents who had lost children in the earthquake. Similar exceptions had previously been made for parents of severely disabled or deceased children. People have also tried to evade the policy by giving birth to a second child in Hong Kong, but at least for Guangdong residents, the one-child policy was also enforced if the birth took place in Hong Kong or abroad.\nIn accordance with China's affirmative action policies towards ethnic minorities, all non-Han ethnic groups were subject to different laws and were usually allowed to have two children in urban areas, and three or four in rural areas. Han Chinese living in rural towns were also permitted to have two children. Because of couples such as these, as well as those who simply paid a fine (or \"social maintenance fee\") to have more children, the overall fertility rate of mainland China was close to 1.4 children per woman as of 2011[ [update]].\nOn 6 January 2010, the former National Population and Family Planning Commission issued the \"national population development\" 12th five-year plan.\nOn 1 January 2016, the one-child policy was replaced by the two-child policy.\nEnforcement.\nThe one-child policy was managed by the National Population and Family Planning Commission under the central government since 1981. The Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China and the National Population and Family Planning Commission were made defunct and a new single agency, the National Health and Family Planning Commission, took over national health and family planning policies in 2013. The agency reports to the State Council.\nThe policy was enforced at the provincial level through contraception, abortion, and fines that were imposed based on the income of the family and other factors. Population and Family Planning Commissions existed at every level of government to raise awareness and carry out registration and inspection work. The fine was a so-called \"social maintenance fee\", the punishment for the families who had more than one child. According to the policy, families who violated the law created a burden on society. Therefore, social maintenance fees were to be used for the operation of the government.\nThe 2019 documentary \"One Child Nation\" portrayed the experiences of enforcement, primarily focusing on rural China. Enforcement of the one-child policy was more uneven in rural China.187\nFinancial.\nThe Family Planning Policy was enforced through a financial penalty in the form of the \"social child-raising fee\", sometimes called a \"family planning fine\" in the West, which was collected as a fraction of either the annual disposable income of city dwellers or of the annual cash income of peasants, in the year of the child's birth. For instance, in Guangdong, the fee was between three and six annual incomes for incomes below the district's per capita income, plus one to two times the annual income exceeding the average. Families were required to pay the fine.\nThe one-child policy was a tool for China to not only address overpopulation, but to also address poverty alleviation and increase social mobility by consolidating the combined inherited wealth of the two previous generations into the investment and success of one child instead of having these resources spread thinly across multiple children. This theoretically allowed for a \"demographic dividend\" to be realized, increasing economic growth and increasing gross national income per capita.\nIf the family was not able to pay the \"social child-raising fee\", then their child would not be able to obtain a , a legal registration document that was required in order to marry, attend state-funded schools, or to receive health care. Many who were unable to pay the fee never attempted to obtain their for fear that the government would force extra fees upon them. Although some provinces had declared that payment of the \"social child-raising fee\" was not required to obtain a , most provinces still required families to pay retroactive fines after registration.\nContraception and sterilization.\nSince the 1970s, the intrauterine device (IUD) has been one of the most widely promoted and practiced forms of contraception. It was the primary alternative to sterilization. As directed, the IUD was medically implanted into women in their child-bearing years to prevent pregnancies, thus out of order births. In the 1980s, women either had to receive an IUD after giving birth to their first child, or the husband would have to undergo a vasectomy. Between 1980 and 2014, 324 million Chinese women received IUDs and 108 million were sterilized. By law, the IUD was placed four months after the delivery of the first child. It was only medically removed after permission to conceive is granted by the community based upon various laws and policies on childbirth quotas. Despite this, some midwives illegally removed the device from their patients. This led to IUD inspections, ensuring that the IUD remained in place. Permanent legal removal of IUDs happens once a woman reaches menopause. In 2016 as means of loosening restrictions and abolishing the one-child policy, the Chinese government now covers the price of IUD removals.\nThe most widely used alternative to IUDs has been sterilization. As the leading form of contraception in China, sterilization has included both tubal ligation and vasectomy. Starting in the early 1970s, massive sterilization campaigns swept across the country. Urban and rural birth planning and family planning services situated themselves in every community. Cash payments or other material rewards and fines acted as incentives, increasing the number of participants. Socially willing participants were considered role models in the community. In 1983 mandatory sterilization occurred after the birth of the second or third child. As the restrictions tightened a few years later, if a woman gave birth to two children, legally she had to be sterilized. Alternatively, in some cases her husband could be sterilized in her place. In other cases, sterilization of surplus children occurred.\nIn the early years of the sterilization campaigns, abortion was a method of birth control highly encouraged by family planning. With 55 percent of abortion recipients as repeat customers and the procedure easily accessible, women had chosen to abort and had been forced to abort because of laws, social pressure, discovery of secret pregnancy, and community birth quotas. In 1995, the People's Republic of China (PRC) warned against abortion as a means of family planning and as a contraceptive. Should an abortion be required, the woman was to have a safe procedure done by a registered physician. Despite this, some women even in the 2000s chose or were encouraged to use traditional abortive products such as blister beetles, also known as \"Mylabris\". Women would ingest the toxins orally or by means of douching with the hopes of inducing abortion. An overdose could lead to death of the mother and fetus. The efficacy of these products has been very low with a high mortality rate. The medical community and PRC have warned against use of these traditional methods.\nThe priorities of individual families also played a role in the birth rate. Families debated the social and economic stability of the household prior to conception. Some families chose to follow the single-child limit due to varying social and economic factors such as marrying later, spacing out children, the cost of raising a child, the fines for having multiple children, birth control policies, and the accessibility of contraceptives. In addition, those who violated the one-child policy could lose their jobs, their titles, a portion of medical insurance, and opportunities for higher education for the second child; they could also face sterilization and the labeling of the second child as a \"black child\". All of the variables played an important role in couples' decisions on when to conceive, placing their social and economic situation above the desire to bear additional children.\nOther examples of contraceptives have included the morning-after pill, birth control pills, and condoms. The morning-after pill has made up 70 percent of oral contraceptives in the Chinese market. Only seven percent of Chinese women had shared that they use the pill and condom in combination. The Chinese government promoted the use of IUDs and sterilization over the combined pill and condom because PRC authorities questioned the voluntary commitment of the public. The Chinese government has distributed free condoms at medical clinics and health centers to adults with proof that they are 18 years of age or older. Additionally, the rate and highly debated sexual education have increased awareness of sex and contraceptive measures among groups of China's young population, further lowering the birth rate.\nEvasion.\nSome couples paid fines to have a second or third child, and others would attempt to circumvent the policy by having non-pregnant friends take the mandatory blood tests.\nPropaganda.\nThe National Family Planning committee developed the slogan ('later, longer, and fewer'), which was first enacted in 1973 and was in effect until 1979. This national idea encouraged later marriages and having fewer children. However, this policy was not effective at enforcing the developing ideal of having fewer children since it was such a new concept that had never been seen in other regions of the world. The various problems that arose during its introduction were slowly addressed and it became progressively more targeted to corner women into limited control over their own bodies.\nThe slogan emerged during the 1970s as a response to China's rapid population growth, which was viewed as a major obstacle to the country's economic and social development. This slogan encapsulated three key principles: marrying later (, ), spacing pregnancies farther apart (, ), and having fewer children (, ) and was emblematic of China's national campaign of mandatory birth planning. The Chinese government aimed to reduce population growth by promoting guidelines for birth control and family planning. The government believed that having fewer children and spacing births more adequately would allow families to allocate more resources per child, resulting in better health and education outcomes for children. The policy aimed to achieve this by allowing parents more time and resources to invest in each child's health and education, as they would have fewer children to care for.\nThe \"later, longer, fewer\" campaign was later replaced by the one-child policy. According to Whyte and colleagues, many of the coercive techniques that became notorious after the one-child policy was launched actually date from this campaign in the 1970s.\nDuring the campaign, the state bureaucracy was in charge of enforcing birth control and oversaw birth-planning workers in every village, urban work unit, and neighborhood. These workers kept detailed records on women of child-bearing age, including past births, contraceptive usage, and menstrual cycles, often becoming \"menstrual monitors\" to detect out-of-quota pregnancies. In some factories, there were quotas for reproduction, and women who did not receive a birth allotment were not supposed to get pregnant.\nWomen who became pregnant without permission were harassed to get an abortion, with pressure also put on their husbands and other family members. Families were threatened that, if they persisted in having an over-quota birth, the baby would be denied household registration, which would mean denial of ration coupons, schooling, and other essential benefits that depended upon registration. In rural areas, women who gave birth to a third child were pressured to get sterilized or have IUDs inserted, while urban women were trusted to continue using effective contraception until they were no longer fertile.\nOfficial statistics show that birth control operations, including abortions, IUD insertions, and sterilizations, increased sharply during the 1970s in association with the campaign to enforce birth limits. These drastic increases in birth-control operations suggest that highly coercive birth planning enforcement was already prevalent in both rural and urban areas, preceding the launch of the one-child policy. However, during the 1970s, the Chinese government was still concerned that the policy would not reduce the growing population sufficiently. They felt the population would grow too fast to be supported, and a one-child policy for all families was introduced in 1979.\nMany of the tactics used by the government were reflected in the day-to-day life of the average Chinese citizen. Since the Chinese government could not outright force its inhabitants to follow strict policy orders, the government developed strategies to encourage and promote individuals to take on this responsibility themselves. A common technique was placing an emphasis on family bonds and how having one child per family would increase emotional ties in parent-offspring relationships as well as extended family giving all their attention to fewer children. While the message of population reduction was urgent and required immediate attention, it was more important for the government to stop conception and new pregnancies. The Family Planning Commission spread propaganda by placing pictures and images on everyday items. Aside from signs and posters on billboards, advertisements were placed on postage stamps, milk cartons, food products and many other household items to promote the benefits of having one child.\nPropaganda took many forms throughout the one-child policy era and was able to target a wide range of age demographics. Children born in this time period spent most of their lives being exposed to the new expectations placed on them by society. Educational programs were also encouraged to promote one-child policy expectations. Many young teenagers were required to read (1981), which emphasized the importance of family planning and birth control measures that would ensure the stability of the nation. Younger generations became the main target audience for much of the propaganda as the one-child policy continued, since they made up a large portion of the population that would contribute to continued growth if no policy was put in place.\nThe one-child campaign extensively used propaganda posters. The aim of the posters was to promote the policy, encourage compliance, and emphasize the benefits of having fewer children. Many of the posters were educational in nature, paying attention to reproduction, sexuality, and conception. They were produced by various government departments, ranging from ministries of health to local population policy centers.\nTo convey the idea that couples should only have one child, the one-child campaign utilized traditional visual elements from (New Year prints) that were popular among the people. Traditionally, these prints employ visual symbols to convey good wishes for the coming new year. In the prints, young children often have been portrayed with pink, chubby cheeks to symbolize the success of family reproduction and a hopeful future. Even without slogans, these pictures were effective in establishing a link between luck and prosperity associated with the New Year and the one-child policy. Traditional elements like chubby, healthy-looking babies resonated with people \u2013 making them believe that compliance with the policy would yield luck, good fortune, and healthy offspring. As the one-child campaign progressed, the policy was linked to national development and wealth. It was considered directly linked to the success of the policy of modernization and reform.\nBy promoting the one-child policy on a daily basis, the government was able to convince the people that it was their duty to fulfill this nationalistic pride. Once the idea and initial steps of this policy were introduced into society, it was regulated by local policy enforcers until finally becoming an internal obligation the community accepted for the greater good of maintaining a nation. In many cases, health centers encouraged the idea of reducing the risks of pregnancy by distributing various forms of contraceptives at no cost, which made protected sex more common than unprotected sex.\nMaterial incentives.\nCouples who only had one child received healthcare subsidies (), retirement funds, and larger grain allowances.186\nRelaxation.\nIn 2013, Deputy Director Wang Peian of the National Health and Family Planning Commission said that \"China's population will not grow substantially in the short term.\" A survey by the commission found that only about half of eligible couples wish to have two children, mostly because of the cost of living impact of a second child.\nIn November 2013, following the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), China announced the decision to relax the one-child policy. Under the new policy, families could have two children if one parent, rather than both parents, was an only child. This mainly applied to urban couples, since there were very few rural, only children due to long-standing exceptions to the policy for rural couples. Zhejiang, one of the most affluent provinces, became the first area to implement this \"relaxed policy\" in January 2014, and 29 out of the 31 provinces had implemented it by July 2014, with the exceptions of Xinjiang and Tibet. Under this policy, approximately 11million couples in China were allowed to have a second child; however, only \"nearly one million\" couples applied to have a second child in 2014, less than half the expected number of 2 million per year. By May 2014, 241,000 out of 271,000 applications had been approved. Officials of China's National Health and Family Planning Commission claimed that this outcome was expected, and that the \"second-child policy\" would continue progressing with a good start.\nAbolition.\nIn October 2015, the Chinese news agency Xinhua announced the government's plans to abolish the one-child policy, now allowing all families to have two children, citing a communiqu\u00e9 issued by the CCP \"to improve the balanced development of population\"\u00a0\u2013 an apparent reference to the country's female-to-male sex ratio\u00a0\u2013 and to deal with an aging population. The new law took effect on 1 January 2016 after it was passed in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on 27 December 2015.\nThe rationale for the abolition was summarized by former \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Mei Fong: \"The reason China is doing this right now is because they have too many men, too many old people, and too few young people. They have this huge crushing demographic crisis as a result of the one-child policy. And if people don't start having more children, they're going to have a vastly diminished workforce to support a huge aging population.\" China's ratio is about five working adults to one retiree; the huge retiree community must be supported, and that will dampen future growth, according to Fong.\nSince the citizens of China are living longer and having fewer children, the growth of the population imbalance is expected to continue. A United Nations projection forecast that \"China will lose 67million working-age people by 2030, while simultaneously doubling the number of elderly. That could put immense pressure on the economy and government resources.\" The longer-term outlook is also pessimistic, based on an estimate by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, revealed by Cai Fang, deputy director. \"By 2050, one-third of the country will be aged 60 years or older, and there will be fewer workers supporting each retired person.\"\nAlthough many critics of China's reproductive restrictions approved of the policy's abolition, Amnesty International said that the move to the two-child policy would not end forced sterilizations, forced abortions, or government control over birth permits. Others had also stated that the abolition was not a sign of the relaxation of authoritarian control in China. A reporter for CNN said, \"It was not a sign that the party will suddenly start respecting personal freedoms more than it has in the past. No, this is a case of the party adjusting policy to conditions. [...] The new policy, raising the limit to two children per couple, preserves the state's role.\"\nThe abolition having a significant benefit was uncertain, as a CBC News analysis indicated: \"Repealing the one-child policy may not spur a huge baby boom, however, in part because fertility rates are believed to be declining even without the policy's enforcement. Previous easings of the one-child policy have spurred fewer births than expected, and many people among China's younger generations see smaller family sizes as ideal.\" The CNN reporter added that China's new prosperity was also a factor in the declining birth rate, saying, \"Couples naturally decide to have fewer children as they move from the fields into the cities, become more educated, and when women establish careers outside the home.\"\nThe Chinese government had expected the abolition of the one-child rule would lead to an increase in births to about 21.9 million births in 2018. The actual number of births was 15.2 million \u2013 the lowest birth rate since 1961.\nOn 31 May 2021, China's government relaxed restrictions even more, allowing women up to three children. This change was brought about mainly due to the declining birth rate and population growth. Although the Chinese government was trying to spark new growth in the population, some experts did not think it would be enough. Many called for the government to remove the limit altogether, though most women and couples already had adopted the idea that one child is enough and to have more is not in their best interest. Because of this new belief, the population would be likely to keep declining, which could have tragic repercussions for China in the coming decades.\nAll restrictions were lifted on 26 July 2021, thus allowing Chinese couples to have any number of children. In 2022, the number of births in China hit another record low of 9.56 million births, the first time the number had dipped below 10 million since the late 1940s according to China Daily. 9.02 million births took place in 2023. Falling numbers of women of childbearing age and reluctance of young women to have children had reduced the China's fertility rate to close to 1.0 by 2024 (a fertility rate of 2.1 is needed for a stable population). A study by the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences and Victoria University, Melbourne, Australia forecast China's population would be 525 million in 2100 compared to 1.4 billion in 2024. In September 2024 China announced the retirement age would be raised as from January 2025 as there were too few young people and a growing senior population.\nPublic responses.\nIn addition to stories of resistance to the policy and official reasons for support such as strengthening China, academic Sarah Mellors Rodriguez describes a surprising number of accounts from her fieldwork in which interviewees fully supported the mandate for personal reasons.186 According to Mellors Rodriguez, for some couples the policy affirmed their own personal beliefs that having smaller families was wiser and more economical.\nUrban responses.\nChina's urban population generally accepted the policy, given the already crowded circumstances and shortage of housing in cities.175 Incentives offered by the state also were effective to make the urban population compliant with the newly introduced family planning. Families that signed the single-child pledge and met the requirements of having only one child were given access to housing and daycare, while non-compliant ones would receive penalties. Examples are obstructing the parents' careers and delaying the payment of their salaries.\nIn her fieldwork interviews, Mellors Rodriguez found that middle income urbanites were more receptive to the limitations of the policy because they generally believed that having one child and providing them with all possible opportunities was more important than having additional heirs.169 Long-term urban residents also reported that supporting multiple children was expensive and burdensome.169\nRural responses.\nThe rural population was more resistant to the policy187 and variations upon the policy were permitted. Mothers of a daughter in several rural provinces were allowed to have a single additional child (a \"1.5-child\" policy) and families in remote areas a second or third child. After collective co-ops were dismantled and decollectivization took place, children became more valued by their parents, as a source of agricultural production, and as a source of the care required by ageing parents. Due to the inherently patrilocal nature of marriage, it was expected that daughters would leave their parents and contribute labor to their husbands' households. The consequent preference for sons came into conflict with the one-child policy and government enforcement of this policy.\nCoercive enforcement measures were taken, and included abortions of \"over-quota\" pregnancies, and sterilization of women. This led to a series of physical conflicts with the government cadres who were assigned to enforce the policy in a specific rural area. Rural families wished to add sons to their families in order to contribute to agricultural production. But the cadres came on the way in conflict with them. Many cadres were middle-aged women who went through the collective period when childbearing was encouraged. They experienced continuous childbearing, and so were strongly supportive of the one-child policy. When these two distinct groups disapproved of each other, conflicts came. More than that, rural families that were desperate to have a son would abuse women who could not give birth to one. They also abandoned infant girls and even engaged in infanticide. As a result, societal relationships were tense within families and also between the cadres and people.\nSince the 1990s, rural policy violations decreased sharply.193 Anthropologist Yan Yunxiang attributes this decrease to greater acceptance of family planning among the new generation of parents, as well as their increased prioritization of material comforts and individual happiness.193\nEffects.\nPopulation.\nBelow are the results of the first three National Population Census of the People's Republic of China (). The first two censuses date back to the 1950s and 1960s, and the last one in the 1980s. They were conducted in 1953, 1964, and 1982 respectively.\nBelow are the results of population investigation after the implementation of one-child policy.\nFertility reduction.\nThe total fertility rate in China continued its fall from 2.8 births per woman in 1979 (already a sharp reduction from more than five births per woman in the early 1970s) to 1.5 by the mid-1990s. Some scholars claim that this decline is similar to that observed in other places that had no one-child restrictions, such as Thailand as well as the Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, a claim designed to support the argument that China's fertility might have fallen to such levels anyway without draconian fertility restrictions.\nAccording to a 2017 study in the \"Journal of Economic Perspectives\", \"the one-child policy accelerated the already-occurring drop in fertility for a few years, but in the longer term, economic development played a more fundamental role in leading to and maintaining China's low fertility level\". However, a more recent study found that China's fertility decline to very low levels by the mid-1990s was far more impressive given its lower level of socio-economic development at that time; even after taking rapid economic development into account, China's fertility restrictions likely averted over 500 million births between 1970 and 2015, with the portion caused by one-child restrictions possibly totaling 400 million. Fertility restrictions also had unintended consequences such as a deficit of 40 million female babies, most of which was due to sex-selective abortion, and the accelerated aging of China's population.\nDisparity in sex ratio at birth.\nThe sex ratio of a newborn infant (between male and female births) in mainland China reached 117:100, and stabilized between 2000 and 2013, about 10% higher than the baseline, which ranges between 103:100 and 107:100. It had risen from 108:100 in 1981\u2014at the boundary of the natural baseline\u2014to 111:100 in 1990. According to a report by the National Population and Family Planning Commission, there would be 30million more men than women in 2020, potentially leading to social instability, and courtship-motivated emigration. The estimate of 30 million cited for the sex disparity, however, may have been very exaggerated, as birth statistics have been skewed by late registrations and unreported births: for instance, researchers have found that census statistics for women in later stages of life do not match the birth statistics.\nThe disparity in the gender ratio at birth increased dramatically after the first birth, for which the ratios remained steadily within the natural baseline over the 20-year interval between 1980 and 1999. Thus, a large majority of couples appeared to accept the outcome of the first pregnancy, whether it was a boy or a girl. If the first child was a girl, and they were able to have a second child, then a couple may have taken extraordinary steps to assure that the second child was a boy. If a couple already had two or more boys, the sex ratio of higher parity births swung decidedly in a feminine direction. This demographic evidence indicates that while families highly valued having male offspring, a secondary norm of having a girl or having some balance in the sexes of children often came into play. Yi Zeng (1993) reported a study based on the 1990 census in which they found sex ratios of just 65 or 70 boys per 100 girls for births in families that already had two or more boys. A study by found a similar pattern among both Han and non-Han nationalities in Xinjiang Province: a strong preference for girls in high parity births in families that had already borne two or more boys. This tendency to favour girls in high-parity births to couples who had already borne sons was later also noted by Coale and Banister, who suggested as well that once a couple had achieved its goal for the number of males, it was also much more likely to engage in \"stopping behavior\", i.e., to stop having more children.\nThe long-term disparity led to a significant gender imbalance or skewing of the sex ratio. As reported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 2015, China had between 32million and 36million more males than would be expected naturally, and this led to social problems. \"Because of a traditional preference for baby boys over girls, the one-child policy is often cited as the cause of China's skewed sex ratio [...] Even the government acknowledges the problem and has expressed concern about the tens of millions of young men who won't be able to find brides and may turn to kidnapping women, sex trafficking, other forms of crime or social unrest.\" The situation was not expected improve in the near future. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, there would be 24 million more men than women of marriageable age by 2020.\nAs the gender gap became more prominent due to the preference of male children over female children, policy enforcers shifted their attention to promoting the benefits that came with having daughters. In rural, isolated regions of China, the government provided families with a daughter more access to education and other resources such as job opportunities to parents in order to encourage the idea that having a daughter also has a positive impact on the family.\nIn December 2016, researchers at the University of Kansas reported that the sex disparity in China was likely exaggerated due to administrative under-reporting and delayed registration of females, rather than abortion and infanticide. The finding concluded that as many as 10 to 15 million missing women had not been properly registered at birth since 1982. The study found that the sex ratios of age groups during the one-child policy were similar to those born in the period without the single-child policy. The study also found significant amounts of females appear after the age of ten due to late registration across different age groups. The reason for under-reporting was attributed to families trying to avoid penalties when girls are born and local government concealing the lack of enforcement from the central government. This implied that the sex disparity of the Chinese newborns was likely exaggerated significantly in previous analyses. Though the degree of data discrepancy, the challenge in relation to the sex-ratio imbalance in China is still disputed among scholars.\nEducation.\nThe one-child policy has been a factor in China's rapid increase in higher educational attainment.59\nResearch shows that a stricter fertility policy would induce higher female educational achievement. Prior to the one-child policy, roughly 30% of women attended higher education, whereas between 1990 and 1992, 50 percent of students in higher education were women. The higher participation rate of women in education could be attributed to the lack of male siblings. As a result, families invested in their single female child. Several studies conclude that girls on average received more years of schooling thanks to the one child policy.69\nAdoption and abandonment.\nThe one-child policy prompted the growth of orphanages in the 1980s. For parents who had \"unauthorized\" births, or who wanted a son but had a daughter, giving up their child for adoption was a strategy to avoid penalties under one-child restrictions. Many orphanages witnessed an influx of baby girls, as families would abandon them in favor of having a male child. Many families also kept their illegal children hidden so that they would not be punished by the government. In fact, \"out adoption\" was not uncommon in China even before birth planning. In the 1980s, adoptions of daughters accounted for slightly above half of the so-called \"missing girls\", as out-adopted daughters often went unreported in censuses and surveys, while adoptive parents were not penalized for violating the birth quota. However, in 1991, a central decree attempted to close off this loophole by raising penalties and levying them on any household that had an \"unauthorized\" child, including those which had adopted children. This closing of the adoption loophole resulted in the abandonment of some two million Chinese children, most of whom were daughters; many of these children ended up in orphanages, with approximately 120,000 of them being adopted by parents from abroad.\nThe peak wave of abandonment occurred in the 1990s, with a smaller wave after 2000. Around the same time, poor care and high mortality rates in some state orphanages generated intense international pressure for reform.\nAfter 2005, the number of international adoptions declined, due both to falling birth rates and the related increase in demand for adoptions by Chinese parents themselves. In an interview with National Public Radio on 30 October 2015, Adam Pertman, president and CEO of the National Center on Adoption and Permanency, indicated that \"the infant girls of yesteryear have not been available, if you will, for five, seven years. China has been ... trying to keep the girls within the country ... And the consequence is that, today, rather than those young girls who used to be available \u2013 primarily girls \u2013 today, it's older children, children with special needs, children in sibling groups. It's very, very different.\"\nTransnational adoption.\nIn April 1992, China implemented laws that enabled foreigners to adopt their orphan children, with the number of children each orphanage could offer for international adoption being limited by the China Center of Adoption Affairs. That same year, 206 children were adopted to the United States, according to the U.S. State Department. Since then, the demand for healthy infant girls increased and transnational adoption increased rapidly. In accordance with this high demand, China began defining more restrictions on foreign adoption, including limitations on applicant's age, marital status, mental and physical health, income, family size, and education. According to the U.S. State Department, there have been over 80,000 international adoptions from China since international adoptions were implemented.\nAs the flow of foreigners adopting from China increased, so did illicit adoption practices. Families in China that did not or could not keep their child would often be subject to abandonment or infanticide. Abandoned babies often found themselves in orphanages, ready to be adopted. This also made it easy for governments to engage in the trafficking of children. In the years between 2002 and 2005, officials in Hunan and Guangdong provinces profited from the buying and trafficking of approximately 1,000 abducted babies for international adoption. \nIn 2024, China ended its international adoption programme. With the exception of blood relatives, transnational adoption has since ceased.\nTwins.\nSince there were no penalties for multiple births,58 it was believed that an increasing number of couples were turning to fertility medicine to induce the conception of twins. According to a 2006 \"China Daily\" report, the number of twins born per year was estimated to have doubled. A 2016 study concluded that the increase in the policy fine of one year's income is associated with an increase in twin births by approximately 0.07 per 1,000 births, indicating that at least one-third of the increase in twins since the 1970s could be explained by the one-child policy.\nQuality of life for women.\nThe increase in the number of only-child girls resulted in gradual changes in social norms regarding gender, including a decrease in the inequalities between women and men.66\nThe one-child policy's limit on the number of children resulted in new mothers having more resources to start investing money in their own well-being. As a result of being an only child, women had increased opportunities to receive an education and support to get better jobs. One side effect of the one-child policy was the liberation of women from the significant duties of taking care of many children and the family in the past; instead, women have had more time for themselves to pursue their career or hobbies. The other major side effect of the policy was that the traditional concepts of gender roles between men and women have weakened. Being one and the only \"chance\" the parents have, women have been expected to compete with peer men for better educational resources or career opportunities. Especially in cities where the one-child policy was much more regulated and enforced, expectations for women to succeed in life are no less than for men. Recent data has shown that the proportion of women attending college is higher than that of men. The policy also had a positive effect at 10 to 19 years of age on the likelihood of completing senior high school in women of Han ethnicity. At the same time, the one-child policy reduced the economic burden for each family. The average conditions for each family improved. As a result, women also have had much more freedom within the family. They have been supported by family to pursue life achievements. Mothers who complied with the policy were able to have longer maternity leave periods as long as they were older than 24. The government encouraged couples to start family planning at an older age. Since many of these women were employed, the incentive to have later births was to provide paid leave as long as they followed the expectation of having one child. However, if they happened to have a second pregnancy they were stripped of their privileges and were not given the same resources compared to their first birth. During this time period, another shift in attitude towards women was the harsh punishment they would receive if they acted against the newly established policy. In areas such as Shanghai, women faced similar punishments as men, while before the Revolution they tended to have more lenient penalties.\nWomen's experiences of the one-child policy shaped their perceptions of it, both of which have been studied extensively by researchers. These studies have revealed a variety of perspectives. While some women viewed the policy as beneficial, particularly in terms of providing better educational and employment opportunities for their children, others experienced significant negative effects, including gender-based discrimination, psychological distress, and social stigma as a byproduct of the policy. One study by Greenhalgh et al. (2005) found that many urban women in China perceived the one-child policy as positive, as it allowed them to have greater control over their reproductive health and career trajectories. These women also valued the educational and economic opportunities afforded to their single child, which were seen as providing a pathway out of poverty and towards upward mobility. However, the same study also found that women's perceptions of the one-child policy were heavily influenced by their social and economic circumstances. For example, women who were unable to afford the fines associated with violating the policy were more likely to form negative perceptions, as were women who faced pressure from their families to have a male child. Another study by Poston and Glover (2005) found that women in rural China were more likely to view the policy as negative. These women reported experiencing significant pressure to have a male child, and those who were unable to do so faced social stigma and discrimination. The distress and pressure to bear a son inflicted on women through marriage, family, and career expectations made Chinese women more likely than men to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and to commit suicide, contrary to the rates observed in Western countries addition, women who violated the policy by having a second child were subject to fines, job loss, and other penalties, which could have significant economic and social consequences. A study by Mosher (2012) found that women who underwent forced abortions or sterilizations as a result of the one-child policy experienced significant psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, and trauma. These women reported feeling violated and traumatized by the forced abortions and sterilizations that occurred as a byproduct of the one-child policy. Such experiences could have long-lasting effects on their mental health and wellbeing. Taken together, these studies suggest that women's diverse perceptions of the one-child policy were based on their individual experiences with it. These experiences were heavily dependent on women's social and economic circumstances, which led to varied perceptions and attitudes on the policy. While some women perceived it as positive, particularly in urban areas, others experienced significant negative effects, including psychological distress and social stigma. The divorce risk was 43% higher for one-girl couples than one-boy couples in rural China during the 2000s, a disparity not found among urban couples who were under less extreme pressure to bear a son. Parents, especially mothers, had to hide pregnancy and birth under great duress, often fleeing from one village to another or from the country to towns. Mothers during both pregnancy and delivery had to stay away from public facilities of maternal and infant health care.\nHealthcare improvements.\nThe one-child policy contributed to China's decrease in maternal and child mortality.66\nIt is reported that the focus of China on population planning has helped to provide better healthcare for women and a reduction in the risks of death and injury associated with pregnancy. Women and children were eligible for preferential hospital treatment. At family planning offices, women received free contraception and prenatal classes that contributed to the policy's success in two respects. First, the average Chinese household has expended fewer resources, both in terms of time and money, on children, giving many more money to invest. Second, since Chinese adults would no longer rely on children to care for them in their old age, there has been an impetus to save money for the future.\n\"Four-two-one\" problem.\nAs the first generation of legally enforced only-children came of age to become parents themselves, one adult child was left with having to provide support for their two parents and four grandparents. Called the \"4-2-1 Problem\", this leaves the older generations with increased chances of dependency on retirement funds or charity in order to receive support. If not for personal savings, pensions or state welfare, most senior citizens would be left entirely dependent upon their very small family or neighbours for assistance. If for any reason, the single child is unable to care for their older adult relatives, the oldest generations would face a lack of resources and necessities. In response to such an issue, by 2007, all provinces in the nation except Henan had adopted a new policy allowing couples to have two children if both parents were only children themselves; Henan followed in 2011.\nImpact on elder care.\nChina's one-child policy had significant implications for many aspects of Chinese society, including care for elderly populations. In \"Gender and elder care in China: the influence of filial piety and structural constraints,\" authors Zhan and Montgomery suggest that the decline of traditional family support networks began with the establishment of work units in the socialist period. These collectives were meant to offer healthcare and housing to their workers. With the economic reforms of the 1980s and 1990s, many of the work units dissolved, leaving many elderly workers without the social support they once had. This was exacerbated by the one-child policy because many families now only had one child to care for elderly parents, leading to increased pressure and responsibility for the sole caregiver.\nAccording to a study by Gustafson (2014), the one-child policy has led to a significant decrease in the availability of family caregivers for the elderly in China. So, tens of millions of retirees now only have one child to rely on for care. This has led to an \"inverted pyramid\", in which two sets of elderly parents must rely on a single married couple of two adult children (each of whom is an only child with no siblings), who in turn have produced a single child on whom the family must eventually rely on in the next generation.\nThe one-child policy in China has had a significant impact on filial piety and elder care. Filial piety is a traditional Confucian value that emphasizes respect, obedience, and care for one's parents and elders. However, the one-child policy has led to a smaller pool of potential caregivers for elderly parents, and has also contributed to a shift in attitudes toward elder care.\nOne study found that the one-child policy has led to a decline in filial piety in China, as fewer children are responsible for caring for their elderly parents. The study also found that the one-child policy has led to a shift in the responsibility for elder care from the family to the state. For example, Feng argued in 2010 that the Chinese government had increased efforts to build residential elder care services by actively promoting the construction of senior housing, homes for the aged, and nursing homes. This included government-sponsored subsidies to spur construction and operation of new facilities. The Virtual Elder Care Home has gained popularity, which features home-care agencies providing a wide range of personal care and homemaker services in elders' homes. Services are initiated by phone calls to a local government-sponsored information and service center, which then directs a qualified service provider to the elder's home. Participating providers contract with the local government and are reimbursed for services purchased by the government on behalf of eligible care recipients. While these programs are mainly centered in urban areas, current policy directives in rural areas favor institutions by encouraging \"centralized support and care\" in rural homes that are run and subsidized by the local government. For rural elders who do not have the option to turn to residential facilities, many have resorted to signing a \"family support agreement\" contract with adult children to ensure needed support and care.\nFurthermore, another study found that the one-child policy has had a significant impact on the quality of elder care in China, with many elderly parents reporting feeling neglected and abandoned by their adult children. This is due to a lack of resources and support from the younger generation.\nUnregistered children.\n\"Heihaizi\" () or 'black child' is a term denoting children born outside the one-child policy, or generally children who are not registered in the Chinese national household registration system.\nBeing excluded from the family register means they do not possess a , which is \"an identifying document, similar in some ways to the American social security card\". In this respect they do not legally exist and as a result cannot access most public services, such as education and health care, and do not receive protection under the law.\nPotential social problems &amp; \"little emperor\" phenomenon.\nIn urban areas especially, a byproduct of the one-child policy has been changing family dynamics. Traditionally, grandparents had been the focal point of the family in China: they were adored by all family members, and were the ones who exercised decision-making in the day-to-day life of the family. Feng suggests that the implementation of the one-child policy and the resulting numbers of one-child families have greatly reduced the multigenerational family form and has weakened the central position of elders in the family. Feng also suggests that the one-child policy has caused parents to spend less leisure time alone, and more leisure time with their children. Feng writes, \"[t]he children tend to rely more so on their parents as companions and to participate together in recreational activities.\" He continues, \"[t]his has promoted an equality in the parent-child relationship and has restricted to a certain extent the interactions of children with others.\" In the one-child family, the core is the parent-child relationship and research suggests that the husband-wife relationship has been less emphasized and cultivated as a result. In China, the one-child policy has been associated with the term \"little emperor\", which describes the perceived effects of parents focusing their attention exclusively on their only child. The term gained popularity as a way to suggest that only children may become \"spoiled brats\" due to the excess attention they receive from their parents.\nA study by Cameron and colleagues explored this phenomenon, finding that the one-child policy had behavioral impacts on only children. The authors tested Beijing youths born in several birth cohorts just before and just after the launch of the one-child policy using economic games designed to detect differences in desirable social behaviors like trust and altruism. The study found that only children in China were more likely to exhibit narcissistic and selfish behavior compared to those with siblings. The study also found that only children had higher levels of academic achievement, but lower levels of social competence and empathy. Overall, these findings suggest that the one-child policy had unintended social and psychological consequences that may have lasting effects on Chinese society as a whole.\nOther scholarship supports that the \"little emperor\" phenomenon does exist. Jiao and colleagues compared children between the ages of four and ten from urban and suburban areas of Beijing using peer ratings of cooperativeness, leadership, and other desirable traits. When they analyzed a matched sample of only children and children with siblings from similar backgrounds, they reported constant patterns in which the only children were rated less positively.\nHowever, researchers Chen and Jin outline some of the arguably positive byproducts of this \"little emperor\" phenomenon. They suggest that, since only children receive more attention and resources from their parents, it can lead to improved academic performance and overall success in life.\nWith the first generation of children born under the policy (which initially became a requirement for most couples with first children born starting in 1979 and extending into the 1980s) reaching adulthood, such worries were reduced.\nToni Falbo, a professor of educational psychology and sociology at the University of Texas at Austin came to the conclusion that no measurable differences exist in terms of sociability and characterization between singleton children and multi-sibling children except that single children scored higher on intelligence and achievement \u2013 due to a lack of \"dilution of resources\".\nSome 30 delegates called on the government in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in March 2007 to abolish the one-child rule, citing \"social problems and personality disorders in young people\". One statement read, \"It is not healthy for children to play only with their parents and be spoiled by them: it is not right to limit the number to two children per family, either.\" The proposal was prepared by Ye Tingfang, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, who suggested that the government at least restore the previous rule that allowed couples to have up to two children. According to a scholar, \"The one-child limit is too extreme. It violates nature's law and, in the long run, this will lead to mother nature's revenge.\"\nBirth tourism.\nReports surfaced of Chinese women giving birth to their second child overseas, a practice known as birth tourism. Many went to Hong Kong, which was exempt from the one-child policy. Likewise, a Hong Kong passport differs from China's mainland passport by providing additional advantages. Recently though, the Hong Kong government has drastically reduced the quota of births set for non-local women in public hospitals.\nAs the United States practices birthright citizenship, all children born in the US automatically have US citizenship at birth. The closest US location from China is Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, a US dependency in the western Pacific Ocean that generally allows Chinese citizens to visit for 14 days without requiring a visa. As of 2012, the Northern Mariana Islands were experiencing an increase in births by Chinese citizens because birth tourism there had become cheaper than in Hong Kong. This option is used by relatively affluent Chinese who may want their children to have the option of living in the US as adults.\nSex-selective abortion.\nDue to the preference in rural Chinese society to give birth to a son, prenatal sex discernment and sex-selective abortions are illegal in China. It is often argued as one of the key factors in the imbalanced sex ratio in China, as excess female infant mortality and under-reporting of female births cannot solely explain this gender disparity. Researchers found that the gender of the firstborn child in rural parts of China impacted whether or not the mother would seek an ultrasound for the second child. 40% of women with a firstborn son sought an ultrasound for their second pregnancy, versus 70% of women with firstborn daughters. This represented a desire for women to have a son if one had not yet been born. In response to this, the Chinese government made sex-selective abortions illegal in 2005.\nIn China, male children have always been favored over female children. With the one-child policy in place, many parents often chose abortions to meet the one-child standard as well as for the satisfaction of having a male son. Male offspring were preferred in rural areas to ensure parents' security in their old age since daughters were expected to marry and support their husbands' family. A common saying in rural areas was , which translates to 'rear a son for your old age'. After the initial forced sterilization and abortion campaign in 1983, citizens of urban areas in China disagreed with the standards being placed on them by the government and having complete disregard for basic human rights. This led to the Chinese government straying away from the forced sterilization processes in attempts to encourage civilian compliance.\nSavings rate.\nThe one-child policy has been a factor behind China's high urban household savings rate.59\nCriticism.\nThe policy was controversial outside China for many reasons, including accusations of human rights abuses in the implementation of the policy, as well as concerns about negative social consequences.\nStatement of the effect of the policy on birth reduction.\nThe Chinese government, quoting Zhai Zhenwu, director of Renmin University's School of Sociology and Population in Beijing, estimates that 400million births were prevented by the one-child policy as of 2011, while some demographers challenge that number, putting the figure at perhaps half that level, according to CNN. Zhai clarified that the 400million estimate referred not just to the one-child policy, but includes births prevented by predecessor policies implemented one decade before, stating that \"there are many different numbers out there but it doesn't change the basic fact that the policy prevented a really large number of births\".\nThis claim is disputed by Wang Feng, director of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center for Public Policy, and Cai Yong from the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Wang argues that \"Thailand and China have had almost identical fertility trajectories since the mid 1980s\", and \"Thailand does not have a one-child policy\".\nChina's Health Ministry has also disclosed that at least 336million abortions were performed on account of the policy.\nAccording to a report by the US embassy, scholarship published by Chinese scholars and their presentations at the October 1997 Beijing conference of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population seemed to suggest that market-based incentives or increasing voluntariness is not morally better but that it is, in the end, more effective. In 1988, Zeng Yi and Professor T. Paul Schultz of Yale University discussed the effect of the transformation to the market on Chinese fertility, arguing that the introduction of the contract responsibility system in agriculture during the early 1980s weakened family planning controls during that period. Zeng contended that the \"big cooking pot\" system of the People's Communes had insulated people from the costs of having many children. By the late 1980s, economic costs and incentives created by the contract system were already reducing the number of children farmers wanted.\nA long-term experiment in a county in Shanxi, in which the family planning law was suspended, suggested that families would not have many more children even if the law were abolished. A 2003 review of the policy-making process behind the adoption of the one-child policy shows that less intrusive options, including those that emphasized delay and spacing of births, were known but not fully considered by China's political leaders.\nUnequal enforcement.\nCorrupted government officials and especially wealthy individuals have often been able to violate the policy in spite of fines. Filmmaker Zhang Yimou had three children and was subsequently fined 7.48million yuan ($1.2million). For example, between 2000 and 2005, as many as 1,968 officials in Hunan province were found to be violating the policy, according to the provincial family planning commission; also exposed by the commission were 21 national and local lawmakers, 24 political advisors, 112 entrepreneurs and 6 senior intellectuals.\nSome of the offending officials did not face penalties, although the government did respond by raising fines and calling on local officials to \"expose the celebrities and high-income people who violate the family planning policy and have more than one child\". Also, people who lived in the rural areas of China were allowed to have two children without punishment, although the family is required to wait a couple of years before having another child.\nHuman rights violations.\nThe one-child policy had been challenged for violating a human right to determine the size of one's own proper family. According to a 1968 proclamation of the International Conference on Human Rights, \"Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children.\"\nAccording to the UK newspaper \"The Daily Telegraph\", a quota of 20,000 abortions and sterilizations was set for Huaiji County, Guangdong in one year due to reported disregard of the one-child policy. According to the article local officials were being pressured into purchasing portable ultrasound devices to identify abortion candidates in remote villages. The article also reported that women as far along as 8.5 months pregnant were forced to abort, usually by an injection of saline solution. A 1993 book by social scientist and anti-abortion political activist Steven W. Mosher reported that women in their ninth month of pregnancy, or already in labour, were having their children killed whilst in the birth canal or immediately after birth.\nAccording to a 2005 news report by Australian Broadcasting Corporation correspondent John Taylor, China outlawed the use of physical force to make a woman submit to an abortion or sterilization in 2002 but ineffectively enforced the measure. In 2012, Feng Jianmei, a villager from Shaanxi province, was forced into an abortion by local officials after her family refused to pay the fine for having a second child. Chinese authorities later apologized and two officials were fired, while five others were sanctioned.\nIn the past, China promoted eugenics as part of its population-planning policies, but the government backed away from such policies, as evidenced by China's ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which compels the nation to significantly reform its genetic testing laws. Recent research has also emphasized the necessity of understanding a myriad of complex social relations that affect the meaning of informed consent in China. Furthermore, in 2003, China revised its marriage registration regulations and couples no longer have to submit to a premarital physical or genetic examination before being granted a marriage license.\nThe United Nations Population Fund's (UNFPA) support for family planning in China, which had been associated in the United States with the one-child policy, led the U.S. Congress to pull out of the UNFPA during the Reagan administration, and again under George W. Bush's presidency, citing human rights abuses and stating that the right to \"found a family\" was protected under the Preamble in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Barack Obama resumed U.S. government financial support for the UNFPA shortly after taking office in 2009, intending to \"work collaboratively to reduce poverty, improve the health of women and children, prevent HIV/AIDS and provide family planning assistance to women in 154 countries\".\nEffect on infanticide rates.\nSex-selective abortion, abandonment, and infanticide are illegal in China. Nevertheless, the US Department of State, the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and the human rights organization Amnesty International have all declared that infanticide still exists. A writer for the \"Georgetown Journal of International Affairs\" wrote, \"The 'one-child' policy has also led to what Amartya Sen first called 'Missing Women', or the 100million girls 'missing' from the populations of China (and other developing countries) as a result of female infanticide, abandonment, and neglect\".\nThe Canadian Broadcasting Corporation offered the following summary as to the long-term effects of sex-selective abortion and abandonment of female infants:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Multiple research studies have also found that sex-selective abortion \u2013 where a woman undergoes an ultrasound to determine the sex of her baby, and then aborts it if it's a girl \u2013 was widespread for years, particularly for second or subsequent children. Millions of female fetuses have been aborted since the 1970s. China outlawed sex selective abortions in 2005, but the law is tough to enforce because of the difficulty of proving why a couple decided to have an abortion. The abandonment, and killing, of baby girls has also been reported, though recent research studies say it has become rare, in part due to strict criminal prohibitions.\nAnthropologist G. William Skinner at the University of California, Davis and Chinese researcher Yuan Jianhua have claimed that infanticide was fairly common in China before the 1990s.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

This spot played an important role in the discovery of the wave nature of light and is a common way to demonstrate that light behaves as a wave.\nThe basic experimental setup requires a point source, such as an illuminated pinhole or a diverging laser beam. The dimensions of the setup must comply with the requirements for Fresnel diffraction. Namely, the Fresnel number must satisfy\nformula_1\nwhere\nFinally, the edge of the circular object must be sufficiently smooth.\nThese conditions together explain why the bright spot is not encountered in everyday life. However, with the laser sources available today, it is undemanding to perform an Arago-spot experiment.\nIn astronomy, the Arago spot can also be observed in the strongly defocussed image of a star in a Newtonian telescope. There, the star provides an almost ideal point source at infinity, and the secondary mirror of the telescope constitutes the circular obstacle.\nWhen light shines on the circular obstacle, Huygens' principle says that every point in the plane of the obstacle acts as a new point source of light. The light coming from points on the circumference of the obstacle and going to the center of the shadow travels exactly the same distance, so all the light passing close by the object arrives at the screen in phase and constructively interferes. This results in a bright spot at the shadow's center, where geometrical optics and particle theories of light predict that there should be no light at all.\nHistory.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the idea that light does not simply propagate along straight lines gained traction. Thomas Young published his double-slit experiment in 1807. The original Arago spot experiment was carried out a decade later and was the deciding experiment on the question of whether light is a particle or a wave. It is thus an example of an \"experimentum crucis\".\nAt that time, many favored Isaac Newton's corpuscular theory of light, among them the theoretician Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson. In 1818 the French Academy of Sciences launched a competition to explain the properties of light, where Poisson was one of the members of the judging committee. The civil engineer Augustin-Jean Fresnel entered this competition by submitting a new wave theory of light.\nPoisson studied Fresnel's theory in detail and, being a supporter of the particle theory of light, looked for a way to prove it wrong. Poisson thought that he had found a flaw when he argued that a consequence of Fresnel's theory was that there would exist an on-axis bright spot in the shadow of a circular obstacle, where there should be complete darkness according to the particle theory of light. This prediction was seen as an absurd consequence of the wave theory, and the failure of that prediction should be a strong argument to reject Fresnel's theory.\nHowever, the head of the committee, Dominique-Fran\u00e7ois-Jean Arago, decided to actually perform the experiment. He molded a 2\u00a0mm metallic disk to a glass plate with wax. He succeeded in observing the predicted spot, confirming Fresnel's prediction.\nArago later noted that the phenomenon (later known as \"Poisson's spot\" or the \"spot of Arago\") had already been observed by Delisle and Maraldi a century earlier.\nAlthough Arago's experimental result was overwhelming evidence in favor of the wave theory, a century later, in conjunction with the birth of quantum mechanics (and first suggested in one of Albert Einstein's \"Annus Mirabilis\" papers), it became understood that light (as well as all forms of matter and energy) must be described as both a particle and a wave (wave\u2013particle duality). However the particle associated with electromagnetic waves, the photon, has nothing in common with the particles imagined in the corpuscular theory that had been dominant before the rise of the wave theory and Arago's powerful demonstration. Before the advent of quantum theory in the late 1920s, only the wave nature of light could explain phenomena such as diffraction and interference. Today it is known that a diffraction pattern appears through the mosaic-like buildup of bright spots caused by single photons, as predicted by Dirac's quantum theory. With increasing light intensity the bright dots in the mosaic diffraction pattern just assemble faster. In contrast, the wave theory predicts the formation of an extended continuous pattern whose overall brightness increases with light intensity.\nTheory.\nAt the heart of Fresnel's wave theory is the Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle, which states that every unobstructed point of a wavefront becomes the source of a secondary spherical wavelet and that the amplitude of the optical field \"E\" at a point on the screen is given by the superposition of all those secondary wavelets taking into account their relative phases. This means that the field at a point P1 on the screen is given by a surface integral:\nformula_2\nwhere the inclination factor formula_3 which ensures that the secondary wavelets do not propagate backwards is given by\nformula_4\nand\nThe first term outside of the integral represents the oscillations from the source wave at a distance \"r\"0. Similarly, the term inside the integral represents the oscillations from the secondary wavelets at distances \"r\"1.\nIn order to derive the intensity behind the circular obstacle using this integral one assumes that the experimental parameters fulfill the requirements of the near-field diffraction regime (the size of the circular obstacle is large compared to the wavelength and small compared to the distances \"g\" = P0C and \"b\" = CP1). Going to polar coordinates then yields the integral for a circular object of radius \"a\" (see for example Born and Wolf):\nformula_6\nThis integral can be solved numerically (see below). If \"g\" is large and \"b\" is small so that the angle formula_7 is not negligible one can write the integral for the on-axis case (P1 is at the center of the shadow) as (see Sommerfeld):\nformula_8\nThe source intensity, which is the square of the field amplitude, is formula_9 and the intensity at the screen formula_10. The on-axis intensity as a function of the distance \"b\" is hence given by:\nformula_11\nThis shows that the on-axis intensity at distances \"b\" much greater than the diameter of the circular obstacle is the same as the source intensity, as if the circular object was not present at all. However at larger distances \"b\", it turns out that the \"size\" of the bright spot (as can be seen in the simulations below where \"b/a\" is increased in successive images) is larger therefore making the spot easier to discern.\nCalculation of diffraction images.\nTo calculate the full diffraction image that is visible on the screen one has to consider the surface integral of the previous section. One cannot exploit circular symmetry anymore, because the line between the source and an arbitrary point on the screen does not pass through the center of the circular object. With the aperture function formula_12 which is 1 for transparent parts of the object plane and 0 otherwise (i.e. It is 0 if the direct line between source and the point on the screen passes through the blocking circular object.) the integral that needs to be solved is given by:\nformula_13\nNumerical calculation of the integral using the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule is not efficient and becomes numerically unstable especially for configurations with large Fresnel number. However, it is possible to solve the radial part of the integral so that only the integration over the azimuth angle remains to be done numerically. For a particular angle one must solve the line integral for the ray with origin at the intersection point of the line P0P1 with the circular object plane. The contribution for a particular ray with azimuth angle formula_14 and passing a transparent part of the object plane from formula_15 to formula_16 is:\nformula_17\nSo for each angle one has to compute the intersection point(\"s\") of the ray with the circular object and then sum the contributions formula_18 for a certain number of angles between 0 and formula_19. Results of such a calculation are shown in the following images.\nThe images are simulations of the Arago spot in the shadow of discs of diameter 4\u00a0mm, 2\u00a0mm, and 1\u00a0mm, imaged 1\u00a0m behind each disc. The disks are illuminated by light of wavelength of 633\u00a0nm, diverging from a point 1\u00a0m in front of each disc. Each image is 16\u00a0mm wide.\nThe Arago spot can also be visualized using lines of average energy flow calculated numerically by averaging the Poynting vector of the electromagnetic field.\nExperimental aspects.\nIntensity and size.\nFor an ideal point source, the intensity of the Arago spot equals that of the undisturbed wave front. Only the width of the Arago spot intensity peak depends on the distances between source, circular object and screen, as well as the source's wavelength and the diameter of the circular object. This means that one can compensate for a reduction in the source's wavelength by increasing the distance between the circular object and screen or reducing the circular object's diameter.\nThe lateral intensity distribution on the screen has in fact the shape of a squared zeroth Bessel function of the first kind when close to the optical axis and using a plane wave source (point source at infinity):\nformula_20\nwhere\nThe following images show the radial intensity distribution of the simulated Arago spot images above:\nThe red lines in these three graphs correspond to the simulated images above, and the green lines were computed by applying the corresponding parameters to the squared Bessel function given above.\nFinite source size and spatial coherence.\nThe main reason why the Arago spot is hard to observe in circular shadows from conventional light sources is that such light sources are bad approximations of point sources. If the wave source has a finite size \"S\" then the Arago spot will have an extent that is given by \"Sb\"/\"g\", as if the circular object acted like a lens. At the same time the intensity of the Arago spot is reduced with respect to the intensity of the undisturbed wave front. Defining the relative intensity formula_21as the intensity divided by the intensity of the undisturbed wavefront, the relative intensity for an extended circular source of diameter w can be expressed exactly using the following equation:\nformula_22\nwhere formula_23and formula_24are the Bessel functions of the first kind. formula_25 is the radius of the disc casting the shadow, formula_26 the wavelength and formula_27 the distance between source and disc. For large sources the following asymptotic approximation applies:\nformula_28\nDeviation from circularity.\nIf the cross-section of the circular object deviates slightly from its circular shape (but it still has a sharp edge on a smaller scale) the shape of the point-source Arago spot changes. In particular, if the object has an ellipsoidal cross-section the Arago spot has the shape of an evolute. Note that this is only the case if the source is close to an ideal point source. From an extended source the Arago spot is only affected marginally, since one can interpret the Arago spot as a point-spread function. Therefore, the image of the extended source only becomes washed out due to the convolution with the point-spread function, but it does not decrease in overall intensity.\nSurface roughness of circular object.\nThe Arago spot is very sensitive to small-scale deviations from the ideal circular cross-section. This means that a small amount of surface roughness of the circular object can completely cancel out the bright spot. This is shown in the following three diagrams which are simulations of the Arago spot from a 4\u00a0mm diameter disc (\"g\" = \"b\" = 1\u00a0m):\nThe simulation includes a regular sinusoidal corrugation of the circular shape of amplitude 10\u00a0\u03bcm, 50\u00a0\u03bcm and 100\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively. Note, that the 100\u00a0\u03bcm edge corrugation almost completely removes the central bright spot.\nThis effect can be best understood using the Fresnel zone concept. The field transmitted by a radial segment that stems from a point on the obstacle edge provides a contribution whose phase is tight to the position of the edge point relative to Fresnel zones. If the variance in the radius of the obstacle are much smaller than the width of Fresnel zone near the edge, the contributions form radial segments are approximately in phase and interfere constructively. However, if random edge corrugation have amplitude comparable to or greater than the width of that adjacent Fresnel zone, the contributions from radial segments are no longer in phase and cancel each other reducing the Arago spot intensity.\nThe adjacent Fresnel zone is approximately given by:\nformula_29\nThe edge corrugation should not be much more than 10% of this width to see a close to ideal Arago spot. In the above simulations with the 4\u00a0mm diameter disc the adjacent Fresnel zone has a width of about 77\u00a0\u03bcm.\nArago spot with matter waves.\nIn 2009, the Arago spot experiment was demonstrated with a supersonic expansion beam of deuterium molecules (an example of neutral matter waves). Material particles behaving like waves is known from quantum mechanics. The wave nature of particles actually dates back to de Broglie's hypothesis as well as Davisson and Germer's experiments. An Arago spot of electrons, which also constitute matter waves, can be observed in transmission electron microscopes when examining circular structures of a certain size.\nThe observation of an Arago spot with large molecules, thus proving their wave-nature, is a topic of current research.\nOther applications.\nBeside the demonstration of wave-behavior, the Arago spot also has a few other applications. One of the ideas is to use the Arago spot as a straight line reference in alignment systems. Another is to probe aberrations in laser beams by using the spot's sensitivity to beam aberrations. Finally, the aragoscope has been proposed as a method for dramatically improving the diffraction-limited resolution of space-based telescopes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It took place approximately northwest of Hastings, close to the present-day town of Battle, East Sussex, and was a decisive Norman victory.\nThe background to the battle was the death of the childless King Edward the Confessor in January 1066, which set up a succession struggle between several claimants to his throne. Harold was crowned king shortly after Edward's death but faced invasions by William, his own brother Tostig, and the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada (Harold III of Norway). Hardrada and Tostig defeated a hastily gathered army of Englishmen at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September 1066. They were in turn defeated by Harold at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September. The deaths of Tostig and Hardrada at Stamford Bridge left William as Harold's only serious opponent. While Harold and his forces were recovering, William landed his invasion forces in the south of England at Pevensey on 28 September and established a beachhead for his conquest of the kingdom. Harold was forced to march south swiftly, gathering forces as he went.\nThe numbers present at the battle are unknown as even modern estimates vary considerably. The composition of the forces is clearer: the English army was composed almost entirely of infantry and had few archers, whereas only about half of the invading force was infantry, the rest split equally between cavalry and archers. Harold appears to have tried to surprise William, but scouts found his army and reported its arrival to William, who marched from Hastings to the battlefield to confront Harold. The battle lasted from about 9\u00a0am to dusk. Early efforts of the invaders to break the English battle lines had little effect. Therefore, the Normans adopted the tactic of pretending to flee in panic and then turning on their pursuers. Harold's death, probably near the end of the battle, led to the retreat and defeat of most of his army. After further marching and some skirmishes, William was crowned as king on Christmas Day 1066.\nThere continued to be rebellions and resistance to William's rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William's conquest of England. Casualty figures are difficult to assess, but some historians estimate that 2,000 invaders died along with about twice that number of Englishmen. William founded a monastery at the site of the battle, the high altar of the abbey church supposedly placed at the spot where Harold died.\nBackground.\nIn 911, the Carolingian ruler Charles the Simple allowed a group of Vikings to settle in Normandy under their leader Rollo. Their settlement proved successful, and they quickly adapted to the indigenous culture, renouncing paganism, converting to Christianity, and intermarrying with the local population. Over time, the frontiers of the duchy expanded to the west. In 1002, King \u00c6thelred II married Emma, the sister of Richard II, Duke of Normandy. Their son Edward the Confessor spent many years in exile in Normandy and succeeded to the English throne in 1042. This led to the establishment of a powerful Norman interest in English politics, as Edward drew heavily on his former hosts for support, bringing in Norman courtiers, soldiers, and clerics and appointing them to positions of power, particularly in the Church. Edward was childless and embroiled in conflict with the formidable Godwin, Earl of Wessex, and his sons, and he may also have encouraged Duke William of Normandy's ambitions for the English throne.\nSuccession crisis in England.\nKing Edward's death on 5 January 1066 left no clear heir, and several contenders laid claim to the throne of England. Edward's immediate successor was the Earl of Wessex, Harold Godwinson, the richest and most powerful of the English aristocrats and son of Godwin, Edward's earlier opponent. Harold was elected king by the Witenagemot of England and crowned by Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, although Norman propaganda claimed that the ceremony was performed by Stigand, the uncanonically elected Archbishop of Canterbury. Harold was at once challenged by two powerful neighbouring rulers. William claimed that he had been promised the throne by Edward and that Harold had sworn agreement to this. Harald Hardrada, King of Norway, also contested the succession; his claim to the throne was based on an agreement between his predecessor Magnus the Good and the earlier king of England Harthacnut, whereby if either died without heir, the other would inherit both England and Norway. William and Harald Hardrada immediately set about assembling troops and ships for separate invasions.\nTostig and Hardrada's invasions.\nIn early 1066, Harold's exiled brother Tostig Godwinson raided southeastern England with a fleet he had recruited in Flanders, later joined by other ships from Orkney. Threatened by Harold's fleet, Tostig moved north and raided in East Anglia and Lincolnshire. He was driven back to his ships by the brothers Edwin, Earl of Mercia and Morcar, Earl of Northumbria. Deserted by most of his followers, he withdrew to Scotland, where he spent the middle of the year recruiting fresh forces. Hardrada invaded northern England in early September, leading a fleet of more than 300 ships carrying perhaps 15,000 men. Hardrada's army was further augmented by the forces of Tostig, who supported the Norwegian king's bid for the throne. Advancing on York, the Norwegians occupied the city after defeating a northern English army under Edwin and Morcar on 20 September at the Battle of Fulford.\nEnglish army and Harold's preparations.\nThe English army was organised along regional lines, with the \"fyrd\", or local levy, serving under a local magnate\u00a0\u2013 whether an earl, bishop or sheriff. The \"fyrd\" was composed of men who owned their own land and who were equipped by their community to fulfil the king's demands for military forces. For every five hides, or units of land nominally capable of supporting one household, one man was supposed to serve. It appears that the hundred was the main organising unit for the \"fyrd\". As a whole, England could furnish about 14,000 men for the \"fyrd\" when it was called out. The \"fyrd\" usually served for two months, except in emergencies. It was rare for the whole national \"fyrd\" to be called out; between 1046 and 1065 it was only done three times, in 1051, 1052, and 1065. The king also had a group of personal armsmen, known as housecarls, who formed the backbone of the royal forces. Some earls also had their own forces of housecarls. Thegns, the local landowning elites, either fought with the royal housecarls or attached themselves to the forces of an earl or other magnate. The \"fyrd\" and the housecarls both fought on foot, with the major difference between them being the housecarls' superior armour. The English army does not appear to have had a significant number of archers.\nHarold had spent mid-1066 on the south coast with a large army and fleet waiting for William to invade. The bulk of his forces were militia who needed to harvest their crops, so on 8 September Harold dismissed the militia and the fleet. Learning of the Norwegian invasion he rushed north, gathering forces as he went, and took the Norwegians by surprise, defeating them at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September. Harald Hardrada and Tostig were killed, and the Norwegians suffered such great losses that only 24 of the original 300 ships were required to carry away the survivors. The English victory came at great cost, as Harold's army was left in a battered and weakened state, and far from the south.\nWilliam's preparations and landing.\nWilliam assembled a large invasion fleet and an army gathered from Normandy and the rest of France, including large contingents from Brittany and Flanders. He spent almost nine months on his preparations, as he had to assemble a fleet from nothing. According to some Norman chronicles, he also secured diplomatic support, although the accuracy of the reports has been a matter of historical debate. The most famous claim is that Pope Alexander II gave a papal banner as a token of support, which only appears in William of Poitiers's account, and not in more contemporary narratives. In April 1066 Halley's Comet appeared in the sky and was widely reported throughout Europe. Contemporary accounts connected the comet's appearance with the succession crisis in England.\nWilliam mustered his forces at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme and was ready to cross the English Channel by about 12 August, but the crossing was delayed, either because of unfavourable weather or to avoid being intercepted by the powerful English fleet. The Normans crossed to England a few days after Harold's victory over the Norwegians, following the dispersal of Harold's naval force, and landed at Pevensey in Sussex on 28 September. A few ships were blown off course and landed at Romney, where the Normans fought the local \"fyrd\". After landing, William's forces built a wooden castle at Hastings, from which they raided the surrounding area. More fortifications were erected at Pevensey.\nNorman forces at Hastings.\nThe exact numbers and composition of William's force are unknown. A contemporary document claims that William had 776 ships, but this may be an inflated figure. Figures given by contemporary writers for the size of the army are highly exaggerated, varying from 14,000 to 150,000. Modern historians have offered a range of estimates for the size of William's forces: 7000\u20138000 men including 1000\u20132000 cavalry; 10,000\u201312,000 men; 10,000 men including 3000 cavalry; or 7500 men. The army consisted of about one-half infantry, one-quarter cavalry, and one-quarter archers or crossbowmen. Later lists of companions of William the Conqueror are extant, but most are padded with extra names; only about 35 named individuals can be reliably identified as having been with William at Hastings.\nThe main armour was chainmail hauberks, usually knee-length, with slits to allow riding, some with sleeves to the elbows. Some hauberks may have been made of scales attached to a tunic, with the scales made of metal, horn or hardened leather. Headgear was usually a conical metal helmet with a vertical band guarding the bridge of the nose. Cavalry and infantry carried shields. The infantryman's shield was usually round and made of wood with metal reinforcement. Horsemen used a kite-shaped shield and were usually armed with a lance. The couched lance, carried tucked against the body under the right arm, was relatively new and probably not used at Hastings, as the terrain was unfavourable for long cavalry charges. Both infantry and cavalry usually fought with a straight sword, long and double-edged. The infantry could also use javelins and long spears. Some of the cavalry may have used a mace instead of a sword. Archers would have used a self bow or a crossbow, and most would not have had armour.\nHarold moves south.\nAfter defeating Tostig and Harald Hardrada in the north, Harold left much of his forces in the north, including Morcar and Edwin, and marched the rest of his army south to deal with the threatened Norman invasion. It is unclear when Harold learned of William's landing, but it was probably during the march. Harold stopped in London for about a week before Hastings, so he likely spent about a week on his march south, averaging about per day, for the approximately . Harold camped at Caldbec Hill on the night of 13 October, near a \"hoar-apple tree\", about from William's castle at Hastings. Some of the early contemporary French accounts mention an emissary or emissaries sent by Harold to William, which is likely, though nothing came of it.\nAlthough Harold attempted to surprise the Normans, William's scouts reported the English arrival to the duke. The events preceding the battle are obscure, with contradictory accounts in the sources, but all agree that William's army advanced from his castle towards the enemy. Harold had taken a defensive position at the top of Senlac Hill (present-day Battle, East Sussex), about from William's castle at Hastings.\nEnglish forces at Hastings.\nThe number of soldiers in Harold's army at Hastings is unknown, as contemporary records do not give reliable figures. Some Norman sources give 400,000 to 1,200,000 on Harold's side, while English sources seem to underestimate Harold's army, perhaps to make the English defeat seem less devastating. Recent historians have suggested figures of between 5000 and 13,000, while most argue for a figure of 7000\u20138000 English troops. These men would have been a mix of the \"fyrd\" and housecarls. Few individual Englishmen are known to have been present; about 20 named individuals can reasonably be assumed to have fought with Harold at Hastings, including Harold's brothers Gyrth and Leofwine and two other relatives.\nThe English army consisted entirely of infantry. It is possible that some of the higher-class members of the army rode to battle but then dismounted when battle was joined to fight on foot. The core of the army was made up of housecarls, full-time professional soldiers. Their armour consisted of a conical helmet, a mail hauberk, and a shield, which might be either kite-shaped or round. Most housecarls fought with the two-handed Danish battleaxe, but they could also carry a sword. The rest of the army was made up of levies from the \"fyrd\", also infantry but more lightly armoured and not professionals. Most of the infantry would have formed part of the shield wall, in which the front ranks locked their shields together. Behind them would have been axemen and javelins as well as archers.\nBattle.\nBackground and location.\nBecause many of the primary accounts contradict each other at times, it is impossible to provide an authoritative description of the battle. The only undisputed facts are that fighting began at 9\u00a0am Saturday 14 October 1066 and that the battle lasted until dusk. Sunset on the day of the battle was at 4:54\u00a0pm, with the battlefield mostly dark by 5:54\u00a0pm and in full darkness by 6:24\u00a0pm. Moonrise that night was not until 11:12\u00a0pm, so once the sun set, there was little light on the battlefield. William of Jumi\u00e8ges reports that William kept his army armed and ready against a surprise attack for the entire night before. The battle took place north of Hastings at the present-day town of Battle, between two hills\u00a0\u2013 Caldbec Hill to the north and Telham Hill to the south. The area was heavily wooded, with a marsh nearby. The name traditionally given to the battle is unusual\u00a0\u2013 there were several settlements much closer to the battlefield than Hastings. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" calls it the battle \"at the hoary apple tree\". Within 40 years, the battle was described by the Anglo-Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis as \"Senlac\", a Norman-French adaptation of the Old English word \"Sandlacu\", which means \"sandy water\". This may have been the name of the stream that crosses the battlefield. The battle was already being referred to as \"bellum Haestingas\" or \"Battle of Hastings\" by 1086, in the Domesday Book.\nThe sun rose at 6:48\u00a0am that morning, with the day unusually bright. The weather conditions are not recorded. The precise route of the English army southward to the battlefield is not known. Several roads are possible: one, an old Roman road that ran from Rochester to Hastings has long been favoured because of a large coin hoard found nearby in 1876. Another possibility is the Roman road between London and Lewes and then over local tracks to the battlefield. Some accounts of the battle indicate that the Normans advanced from Hastings to the battlefield, but the contemporary account of William of Jumi\u00e8ges places the Normans at the site of the battle the night before. Most historians incline towards the former view, but M. K. Lawson argues that William of Jumi\u00e8ges's account is correct.\nDispositions of forces and tactics.\nHarold's forces deployed in a small, dense formation at the top of a steep slope, with their flanks protected by woods and marshy ground in front of them. The line may have extended far enough to be anchored on a nearby stream. The English formed a shield wall, with the front ranks holding their shields close together or even overlapping to protect from attack. Sources differ on the exact site at which the English fought: some sources state the site of the abbey, but some newer sources suggest it was Caldbec Hill.\nMore is known about the Norman deployment. William appears to have arranged his forces in three groups, or \"battles\", which roughly corresponded to their origins. The left units were the Bretons, along with those from Anjou, Poitou and Maine. This division was led by Alan the Red, a relative of the Breton count. The centre was held by the Normans, under the direct command of William and with many of his relatives and kinsmen grouped around the ducal party. The final division, on the right, consisted of the Frenchmen, along with some men from Picardy, Boulogne, and Flanders. The right was commanded by William fitzOsbern and Count Eustace II of Boulogne. The front lines were made up of archers, with a line of foot soldiers armed with spears behind. There were probably a few crossbowmen and slingers in with the archers. The cavalry was held in reserve, and a small group of clergymen and servants situated at the base of Telham Hill was not expected to take part in the fighting.\nWilliam's disposition of his forces implies that he planned to open the battle with archers in the front rank weakening the enemy with arrows, followed by infantry who would engage in close combat. The infantry would create openings in the English lines that could be exploited by a cavalry charge to break through the English forces and pursue the fleeing soldiers.\nBeginning of the battle.\nThe battle opened with the Norman archers shooting uphill at the English shield wall, to little effect. The uphill angle meant that the arrows either bounced off the shields of the English or overshot their targets and flew over the top of the hill. The lack of English archers hampered the Norman archers, as there were few English arrows to be gathered up and reused. After the attack from the archers, William sent the spearmen forward to attack the English. They were met with a barrage of spears, axes and stones. The infantry was unable to force openings in the shield wall, and the cavalry advanced in support. The cavalry also failed to make headway, and a general retreat began, blamed on the Breton division on William's left. A rumour started that William had been killed, which added to the confusion. The English forces began to pursue the fleeing invaders, but William rode through his forces, showing his face and yelling that he was still alive. He then led a counter-attack against the pursuing English forces; some of the English rallied on a hillock before being overwhelmed.\nIt is not known whether the English pursuit was ordered by Harold or if it was spontaneous. The 12th-century chronicler Wace relates that Harold ordered his men to stay in their formations, but no other account gives this detail. The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the death of Gyrth and Leofwine occurring just before the fight around the hillock. This may mean that the two brothers led the pursuit. The \"Carmen de Hastingae Proelio\" relates a different story for the death of Gyrth, stating that William slew him in combat, perhaps thinking that Gyrth was Harold. William of Poitiers states that the bodies of Gyrth and Leofwine were found near Harold's, implying that they died late in the battle. It is possible that if the two brothers died early in the fighting their bodies were taken to Harold, thus accounting for their being found near his body after the battle. The military historian Peter Marren speculates that if Gyrth and Leofwine died early in the battle, that may have influenced Harold to stand and fight to the end.\nFeigned flights.\nA lull probably occurred early in the afternoon, and a break for rest and food would probably have been needed. William may have also needed time to implement a new strategy, which may have been inspired by the English pursuit and subsequent rout by the Normans. If the Normans could send their cavalry against the shield wall and then draw the English into more pursuits, breaks in the English line might form. William of Poitiers says the tactic was used twice. Although arguments have been made that the chroniclers' accounts of this tactic were meant to excuse the flight of the Norman troops from battle, this is unlikely as the earlier flight was not glossed over. It was a tactic used by other Norman armies during the period. Some historians have argued that the story of the use of feigned flight as a deliberate tactic was invented after the battle; however most historians agree that it was used by the Normans at Hastings.\nAlthough the feigned flights did not break the lines, they probably thinned out the housecarls in the English shield wall. The housecarls were replaced with members of the \"fyrd\", and the shield wall held. Archers appear to have been used again before and during an assault by the cavalry and infantry led by William. Although 12th-century sources state that the archers were ordered to shoot at a high angle to shoot over the front of the shield wall, there is no trace of such an action in the more contemporary accounts. It is not known how many assaults were launched against the English lines, but some sources record various actions by both Normans and Englishmen that took place during the afternoon's fighting. The \"Carmen\" claims that William had two horses killed under him during the fighting, but William of Poitiers's account states that it was three.\nDeath of Harold.\nHarold appears to have died late in the battle, although accounts in the various sources are contradictory. William of Poitiers only mentions his death, without giving any details on how it occurred. The Bayeux Tapestry is not helpful, as it shows a figure holding an arrow sticking out of his eye next to a falling fighter being hit with a sword. Over both figures is a statement \"Here King Harold has been killed\". It is not clear which figure is meant to be Harold, or if both are meant. The earliest written mention of the traditional account of Harold dying from an arrow to the eye dates to the 1080s from a history of the Normans written by an Italian monk, Amatus of Montecassino. William of Malmesbury states that Harold died from an arrow to the eye that went into the brain and that a knight wounded Harold at the same time. Wace repeats the arrow-to-the-eye account. The \"Carmen\" states that William killed Harold, but this is unlikely, as such a feat would have been recorded elsewhere. The account of William of Jumi\u00e8ges is even more unlikely, as it has Harold dying in the morning, during the first fighting. The \"Chronicle of Battle Abbey\" states that no one knew who killed Harold, as it happened in the press of battle. A modern biographer of Harold, Ian Walker, states that Harold probably died from an arrow in the eye, although he also says it is possible that Harold was struck down by a Norman knight while mortally wounded in the eye. Another biographer of Harold, Peter Rex, after discussing the various accounts, concludes that it is not possible to declare how Harold died.\nHarold's death left the English forces leaderless, and they began to collapse. Many of them fled, but the soldiers of the royal household gathered around Harold's body and fought to the end. The Normans began to pursue the fleeing troops, and except for a rearguard action at a site known as the \"Malfosse\", the battle was over. Exactly what happened at the Malfosse, or \"Evil Ditch\", and where it took place, are unclear. It occurred at a small fortification or set of trenches where some Englishmen rallied and seriously wounded Eustace of Boulogne before being defeated by the Normans.\nReasons for the outcome.\nHarold's defeat was probably due to several circumstances. One was the need to defend against two almost simultaneous invasions. Harold's dismissal of his forces in southern England on 8 September also contributed to the defeat. Many historians fault Harold for hurrying south and not gathering more forces before confronting William at Hastings, although it is not clear that the English forces were insufficient to deal with William's forces. However, the length of the battle, which lasted an entire day, shows that the English forces were not tired by their long march. Tied in with the speed of Harold's advance to Hastings is the possibility Harold may not have trusted Edwin and Morcar once Tostig had been defeated, and declined to bring them and their forces south. Modern historians have pointed out that one reason for Harold's rush to battle was to contain William's depredations and keep him from breaking free of his beachhead.\nMost of the blame for the defeat probably lies in the events of the battle. William was the more experienced military leader, and in addition, the lack of cavalry on the English side allowed Harold fewer tactical options. Some writers have criticised Harold for not exploiting the opportunity offered by the rumoured death of William early in the battle. The English appear to have erred in not staying strictly on the defensive, for when they pursued the retreating Normans they exposed their flanks to attack. Whether this was due to the inexperience of the English commanders or the indiscipline of the English soldiers is unclear. In the end, Harold's death appears to have been decisive, as it signalled the break-up of the English forces in disarray. Historian David Nicolle states that William's army \"demonstrated\u00a0\u2013 not without difficulty\u00a0\u2013 the superiority of Norman-French mixed cavalry and infantry tactics over the Germanic-Scandinavian infantry traditions of the Anglo-Saxons.\"\nAftermath.\nThe day after the battle, Harold's body was identified, either by his armour or by marks on his body. His personal standard was presented to William and later sent to the papacy. The bodies of the English dead, including some of Harold's brothers and housecarls, were left on the battlefield, although some were later removed by relatives. The Norman dead were buried in a large communal grave, which has not been found. \nCasualty figures are unknown. Losses suffered among Englishmen known to have been at the battle imply a fatality rate of about 50 per cent of combatants, although this may be too high. Of the named Normans who fought at Hastings, one in seven is stated to have died, but these were all noblemen, and the death rate among common soldiers was probably higher. Although Orderic Vitalis's figures are highly exaggerated, his ratio of one in four casualties may be accurate. Marren speculates that perhaps 2,000 Normans and 4,000 Englishmen were killed at Hastings. Reports stated that some of the English dead were still being found on the hillside years later. \nAlthough scholars long thought that remains would not be recoverable due to the acidic soil, recent finds have changed this view. One skeleton that was found in a medieval cemetery, and originally was thought to be associated with the 13th century Battle of Lewes, now is thought to be associated with Hastings instead.\nOne story relates that Gytha, Harold's mother, offered the victorious duke the weight of her son's body in gold for its custody but was refused. William ordered that Harold's body be thrown into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear. Another story holds that Harold was buried at the top of a cliff. Waltham Abbey, which had been founded by Harold, later claimed that his body had been secretly buried there. Other legends claimed that Harold did not die at Hastings but escaped and became a hermit at Chester.\nWilliam expected to receive the submission of the surviving English leaders after his victory, but instead Edgar \u00c6theling was proclaimed king by the Witenagemot, with the support of Earls Edwin and Morcar, Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Ealdred, the Archbishop of York. William therefore advanced on London, marching around the coast of Kent. He defeated an English force that attacked him at Southwark but was unable to storm London Bridge, forcing him to reach the capital by a more circuitous route.\nWilliam moved up the Thames valley to cross the river at Wallingford, where he received the submission of Stigand. He then travelled north-east along the Chilterns, before advancing towards London from the north-west, fighting further engagements against forces from the city. The English leaders surrendered to William at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. William was acclaimed King of England and crowned by Ealdred on 25 December 1066, in Westminster Abbey.\nDespite the submission of the English nobles, resistance continued for several years. There were rebellions in Exeter in late 1067, an invasion by Harold's sons in mid-1068, and an uprising in Northumbria in 1068. In 1069, William faced more troubles from Northumbrian rebels, an invading Danish fleet, and rebellions in the south and west of England. He ruthlessly put down the various risings, culminating in the Harrying of the North in late 1069 and early 1070 that devastated parts of northern England. A further rebellion in 1070 by Hereward the Wake was also defeated by the king, at Ely.\nBattle Abbey was founded by William at the site of the battle. According to 12th-century sources, William made a vow to found the abbey, and the high altar of the church was placed at the site where Harold had died. More likely, the foundation was imposed on William by papal legates in 1070. The topography of the battlefield has been altered by subsequent construction work for the abbey, and the slope defended by the English is now much less steep than it was at the time of the battle; the top of the ridge has also been built up and levelled. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the abbey's lands passed to secular landowners who used it as a residence or country house. In 1976, the estate was put up for sale and purchased by the government with the aid of some American donors who wished to honour the 200th anniversary of American independence. The battlefield and abbey grounds are currently owned and administered by English Heritage and are open to the public.\nThe Bayeux Tapestry is an embroidered narrative of the events leading up to Hastings probably commissioned by Odo of Bayeux soon after the battle, perhaps to hang at the bishop's palace at Bayeux. In modern times annual reenactments of the battle have drawn thousands of participants and spectators to the site of the original battle. Some English veterans of the battle left England and joined the Varangian Guard in Constantinople. They fought the Normans again at the Battle of Dyrrhachium in 1081, and were defeated again in similar circumstances.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44668", "revid": "14650386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44668", "title": "Porcupine", "text": "Rodent with a coat of sharp spines\nPorcupines are large rodents with coats of sharp spines, or quills, that protect them against predators. The term covers two families of animals: the Old World porcupines in the family Hystricidae, and the New World porcupines in the family Erethizontidae. Both families display superficially similar coats of rigid or semi-rigid quills, which are modified hairs composed of keratin, and belong to the infraorder Hystricognathi within the diverse order Rodentia. The two groups are distinct and are not closely related to each other within Hystricognathi. The largest species of porcupine is the third-largest living rodent in the world, after the capybara and beaver.\nThe Old World porcupines (Hystricidae) live in Italy, West and South Asia, and most of Africa. They are large, terrestrial, and strictly nocturnal. New World porcupines (Erethizontidae) are indigenous to North America and northern South America. They live in wooded areas and can climb trees, where some species spend their entire lives. They are generally smaller than their Old World counterparts and are less strictly nocturnal.\nMost porcupines are about long, with a long tail. Weighing , they are rounded, large, and slow. Their colouration consists of various shades of brown, grey and white. Porcupines have various methods to defend themselves from predators, the most prominent being the use of their quills, which advertises their unsuitability for being preyed upon. This strategy is known as aposematism. To some degree, the spiny protection resembles that of the hedgehogs, echidnas, and tenrecs, none of which share any spiny ancestors; all of them, and also the old-world and new world porcupines, are products of convergent evolution. The spines of the various groups also vary markedly. \nHumans have a varied history with porcupines, with some cultures considering a symbols of self-defense or cautiousness. Porcupines appear in mythology in regions where the animal has economic significance, such as for food or in the production of quillwork textiles.\nTerminology and etymology.\nThe word \"porcupine\" comes from the Latin 'pig' + 'spine, quill', from Old Italian \"porcospino\", 'thorn-pig'. A regional American name for the animal is \"quill-pig\".\nA baby porcupine is known as a porcupette. When born, a porcupette's quills are soft hair; they harden within a few days, forming the sharp quills of adults.\nTaxonomy and evolution.\nClassification.\nA porcupine is any of 29 species of rodents belonging to the families Erethizontidae (genera: \"Coendou\", \"Erethizon\", and \"Chaetomys\") or Hystricidae (genera: \"Atherurus\", \"Hystrix\", and \"Trichys\"). The two families of porcupines are quite different, and although both belong to the Hystricognathi branch of the vast order Rodentia, they are not closely related.\nPorcupines are distributed into two evolutionarily independent groups within the infraorder Hystricognathi, part of the suborder Hystricomorpha of the Rodentia:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEvolution.\nStudies on the physical characteristics of New World porcupines initially described them as being the most basal (earliest to diverge) group among the hystricognaths, and fossil records point to a common ancestor of Erethizontidae and all other hystricognaths occurring https:// 33.9 in the early Oligocene. Doroth\u00e9e Huchon and Emmanuel Douzery wrote in 2001 on the diversification of the hystricognaths, reporting that molecular phylogenetic studies using nuclear genes (e.g., the von Willebrand factor gene) suggested that the Hystricidae (Old World porcupines), Phiomorpha, and Caviomorpha (which includes New World porcupines) lineages split some time 63 to 43 million years ago. This supported a single colonization event of South America by hystricognaths. A 2013 study of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes supports a mid-Eocene diversification of New World hystricognaths, with family-level splits occurring in the early Miocene.\nFossils belonging to the genus \"Hystrix\" date back to the late Miocene of Africa and Asia. One of the oldest known porcupine fossils is \"Hystrix primigenia\", an Old World porcupine that lived in the late Miocene to the Pliocene; the oldest known porcupine fossil in Asia, \"Hystrix lufengensis\", dates back https:// million years, also in the late Miocene.\nBiology.\nOld World compared with New World species.\nThe 11 Old World porcupines tend to be fairly large and have spines grouped in clusters.\nThe two subfamilies of New World porcupines are mostly smaller (although the North American porcupine reaches about in length and ), have their quills attached singly rather than grouped in clusters, and are excellent climbers, spending much of their time in trees. The New World porcupines evolved their spines independently (through convergent evolution) and are more closely related to several other families of rodents than they are to the Old World porcupines.\nThe quills of New World porcupines are unique among spined rodents, being stiff with a circular cross section that is small in proportion to their length, which allows them to penetrate further into a potential predator before breaking off near the base. In contrast, the spines of Old World porcupines are similar to those of other rodents with spiny hair, such as the bristly mouse and short-tailed spiny rat, in that they have a concave cross-section and are shorter and softer, making them break off closer to the tip.\nDescription.\nPorcupines are rodents of varying fur color that are characterized by their abundance of protruding spines, or quills, found all along the head and body of the animal. Some species have quills that extend from the tail as well. They vary in size considerably: an adult Andean porcupine weighs roughly , while the crested porcupine can grow to weigh up to .\nLongevity.\nPorcupines have a relatively high longevity and hold the record for being the longest-living rodent, with one individual named Cooper living over 32 years.\nDiet.\nThe North American porcupine is an herbivore and often climbs trees for food; it eats leaves, herbs, twigs, and green plants such as clover. In the winter, it may eat bark. The African porcupine is not a climber; instead, it forages on the ground. It is mostly nocturnal but will sometimes forage for food during the day, eating bark, roots, fruits, berries, and farm crops. Porcupines have become a pest in Kenya and are eaten as a delicacy.\nDefense.\nDefensive behaviour displays in a porcupine depend on sight, scent, and sound. Often, these displays are shown when a porcupine becomes agitated or annoyed. There are four main displays seen in a porcupine: (in order from least to most aggressive) quill erection, teeth clattering, odour emission, and attack. A porcupine's colouring aids in part of its defence as most of the predators are nocturnal and colour-blind. A porcupine's markings are black and white. The dark body and coarse hair of the porcupine are dark brown/black and when quills are raised, present a white strip down its back mimicking the look of a skunk. This, along with the raising of the sharp quills, deters predators. Along with the raising of the quills, porcupines clatter their teeth to warn predators not to approach. The incisors vibrate against each other, the strike zone shifts back, and the cheek teeth clatter. This behaviour is often paired with body shivering, which is used to further display the dangerous quills. The rattling of quills is aided by the hollow quills at the back end of the porcupine. The use of odour is when the sight and sound have failed. An unpleasant scent is produced from the skin above the tail in times of stress and is often seen with a quill erection. If these processes fail, the porcupine will attack by running sideways or backwards into predators. A porcupine's tail can also be swung in the direction of the predator; if contact is made, the quills could be impaled into the predator causing injury or death.\nQuills.\nPorcupines' quills, or spines, take on various forms depending on the species, but all are modified hairs coated with thick plates of keratin and are embedded in the skin musculature. Old World porcupines have quills embedded in clusters, whereas in New World porcupines, single quills are interspersed with bristles, underfur, and hair.\nQuills are released by contact or may drop out when the porcupine shakes its body. New quills grow to replace lost ones. Despite what is commonly assumed and depicted in media, porcupines cannot launch their quills at range.\nThere are some possible antibiotic properties within the quills, specifically associated with the free fatty acids coating the quills. The antibiotic properties are believed to aid a porcupine that has suffered from self-injury.\nEcology.\nBehavior.\nPorcupines are slow-moving animals. All porcupines are social to some degree, though only Old World porcupines are known to form clans or family units.\nHabitat and range.\nPorcupines occupy a small range of habitats in tropical and temperate parts of Asia, Southern Europe, Africa, and North and South America. They live in forests and deserts, rocky outcrops, and hillsides. Some New World porcupines live in trees, but Old World porcupines prefer a rocky environment. Porcupines can be found on rocky areas up to high. They are generally nocturnal but are occasionally active during daylight.\nRelationships with humans.\nUse as food and clothing.\nPorcupines are seldom eaten in Western culture but are eaten often in Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, where the prominent use of them as a food source has contributed to declines in porcupine populations. In China, the Chinese porcupine (\"Hystix brachyura hodgsoni\"), a subspecies of the Malayan porcupine, was one of several wild animals that was widely farmed for its meat, but a broad ban on the consumption of many wild animals in 2020 led to stoppage of this practice across the country.\nNaturalist William J. Long reported the taste of the North American porcupine as \"vile\" and \"malodorous\" and delightful only to a lover of strong cheese.\nMore commonly, their quills and guard hairs are used for traditional decorative clothing; for example, their guard hairs are used in the creation of the Native American \"porky roach\" headdress. The main quills may be dyed and then applied in combination with thread to embellish leather accessories, such as knife sheaths and leather bags. Lakota women would harvest the quills for quillwork by throwing a blanket over a porcupine and retrieving the quills left stuck in the blanket.\nUse in research.\nThe presence of barbs, acting like anchors, causes increased pain when removing a quill that has pierced the skin. The shape of the barbs makes the quills effective for penetrating the skin and for remaining in place. The quills have inspired research for such applications as the design of hypodermic needles and surgical staples. In contrast to the current design for surgical staples, the porcupine quill and barb design would cause less damage to the skin when removed.\nPorcupine quills have been the subject of research due to their composition and ability to withstand compression. Quills are made of alpha-keratin and are filled with a foam core. Structural units that replicate the design of porcupine quills have been created through stereolithogaphy, a 3D printing technique. \nDomestication.\nPorcupines are sometimes kept as exotic pets. They are also raised in captivity for research purposes and to aid in conservation efforts.\nIn culture.\nPorcupines appear in the mythology of various cultures where the animal is endemic or economically important. It is one of the twenty-eight animals noted as being underdeveloped in some senses in the \"Bhagavata Purana\", classified with other \"five-nailed\" animals such as the tiger and the tortoise. In San culture, it is grouped alongside animals that have significant reserves of fat or association with honey, such as the hyrax.\nAs the North American porcupine is widely distributed across the continent, it appears in the mythology of various Native American tribes. In some, such as the Pit River Tribe, they can signify good fortune in hunting. The Arapaho, originally settled in the Red River Valley, made extensive use of quillwork and continued to seek out quills through trade or long expeditions after forced migration to the Great Plains, where porcupines were scarce. They are one of several groups that made use of the North American porcupine for clothing and art, as the practice is recorded from Maine to Alaska.\nThe porcupine is seen as a pest in some areas due to their salt-seeking behavior. Porcupines will seek out any source of sodium to replenish their reserves after consuming significant amounts of plant matter, and will resort to gnawing on anything that has residues of sodium on or in it, including those from human perspiration. They may chew on tool handles or salt licks, and bite marks are often found in plywood and rubber tires or hoses due to the sodium salts in adhesives used in their manufacture.\nReferences.\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His parents were Fran\u00e7ois Bonaventure Arago (1754\u20131814) and Marie Arago (1755\u20131845).\nArago was the eldest of six brothers. Jean (1788\u20131836) emigrated to North America and became a general in the Mexican army. Jacques (1790\u20131854) took part in Louis de Freycinet's exploring voyage in the \"Uranie\" from 1817 to 1821, and on his return to France devoted himself to his journalism and the drama. Victor (1792\u20131867) was a French soldier. Joseph (1796\u20131860) became a soldier in the Mexican army. \u00c9tienne (1802\u20131892), is said to have collaborated with Honor\u00e9 de Balzac in \"The Heiress of Birague\", and from 1822 to 1847 wrote a great number of light dramatic pieces, mostly in collaboration.\nShowing decided military tastes, Fran\u00e7ois Arago was sent to the municipal college of Perpignan, where he began to study mathematics in preparation for the entrance examination of the . Within two years and a half he had mastered all the subjects prescribed for examination, and a great deal more, and, on going up for examination at Toulouse, he astounded his examiner by his knowledge of J.-L. Lagrange's work.\nTowards the close of 1803, Arago entered the , Paris, but apparently found the professors there incapable of imparting knowledge or maintaining discipline. The artillery service was his ambition, and in 1804, through the advice and recommendation of Sim\u00e9on Poisson, he received the appointment of secretary to the Paris Observatory. He now became acquainted with Pierre-Simon Laplace, and through his influence was commissioned, with Jean-Baptiste Biot, to complete the meridian arc measurements which had been begun by J. B. J. Delambre, and interrupted since the death of P. F. A. M\u00e9chain in 1804 (the meridian arc of Delambre and M\u00e9chain). Arago and Biot left Paris in 1806 and began operations along the mountains of Spain. Biot returned to Paris after they had determined the latitude of Formentera, the southernmost point to which they were to carry the survey. Arago continued the work until 1809, his purpose being to measure a meridian arc in order to determine the exact length of a metre (see Paris meridian#History).\nAfter Biot's departure, the political ferment caused by the entrance of the French into Spain extended to the Balearic Islands, and the population suspected Arago's movements and his lighting of fires on the top of Mount Galatz\u00f3 (Catalan: Mola de l'Esclop) as the activities of a spy for the invading army. Their reaction was such that he was obliged to give himself up for imprisonment in the fortress of Bellver in June 1808. On 28 July he escaped from the island in a fishing-boat, and after an adventurous voyage he reached Algiers on 3 August. From there he obtained a passage in a vessel bound for Marseille, but on 16 August, just as the vessel was nearing Marseille, it fell into the hands of a Spanish corsair. With the rest the crew, Arago was taken to Roses, and imprisoned first in a windmill, and afterwards in a fortress, until the town fell into the hands of the French, when the prisoners were transferred to Palamos.\nAfter three months' imprisonment, Arago and the others were released on the demand of the dey of Algiers, and again set sail for Marseille on 28 November, but then within sight of their port they were driven back by a northerly wind to Bougie on the coast of Africa. Transport to Algiers by sea from this place would have occasioned a weary delay of three months; Arago, therefore, set out over land, guided by a Muslim priest, and reached it on Christmas Day. After six months in Algiers he once again, on 21 June 1809, set sail for Marseille, where he had to undergo a monotonous and inhospitable quarantine in the lazaretto, before his difficulties were over. The first letter he received, while in the lazaretto, was from Alexander von Humboldt; and this was the origin of a connection which, in Arago's words, \"lasted over forty years without a single cloud ever having troubled it.\"\nScientific studies.\nArago had succeeded in preserving the records of his survey; and his first act on his return home was to deposit them in the Bureau des Longitudes at Paris. As a reward for his adventurous conduct in the cause of science, he was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences, at the remarkably early age of twenty-three, and before the close of 1809 he was chosen by the council of the to succeed Gaspard Monge in the chair of analytical geometry. At the same time he was named by the emperor one of the astronomers of the Paris Observatory, which was accordingly his residence till his death. It was in this capacity that he delivered his remarkably successful series of popular lectures in astronomy, which were continued from 1812 to 1845.\nIn 1818 or 1819 he proceeded along with Biot to execute geodetic operations on the coasts of France, England and Scotland. They measured the length of the seconds pendulum at Leith, Scotland, and in the Shetland Islands, the results of the observations being published in 1821, along with those made in Spain. Arago was elected a member of the Bureau des Longitudes immediately afterwards, and contributed to each of its Annuals, for about twenty-two years, important scientific notices on astronomy and meteorology and occasionally on civil engineering, as well as interesting memoirs of members of the Academy.\nArago's earliest physical researches were on the pressure of steam at different temperatures, and the velocity of sound, 1818 to 1822. His magnetic observations mostly took place from 1823 to 1826. He discovered rotatory magnetism, what has been called Arago's rotations, and the fact that most bodies could be magnetized; these discoveries were completed and explained by Michael Faraday.\nArago warmly supported Augustin-Jean Fresnel's optical theories, helping to confirm Fresnel's wave theory of light by observing what is now known as the spot of Arago. The two philosophers conducted together those experiments on the polarization of light which led to the inference that the vibrations of the luminiferous ether were transverse to the direction of motion, and that polarization consisted of a resolution of rectilinear propagation into components at right angles to each other. The subsequent invention of the polariscope and discovery of Rotary polarization are due to Arago. He invented the first polarization filter in 1812. He was the first to perform a polarimetric observation of a comet when he discovered polarized light from the tail of the Great Comet of 1819.\nThe general idea of the experimental determination of the velocity of light in the manner subsequently effected by Hippolyte Fizeau and L\u00e9on Foucault was suggested by Arago in 1838, but his failing eyesight prevented his arranging the details or making the experiments.\nArago's fame as an experimenter and discoverer rests mainly on his contributions to magnetism in the co-discovery with L\u00e9on Foucault of eddy currents, and still more to optics. He showed that a magnetic needle, made to oscillate over nonferrous surfaces, such as water, glass, copper, etc., falls more rapidly in the extent of its oscillations according as it is more or less approached to the surface. This discovery, which earned him the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1825, was followed by another, that a rotating plate of copper tends to communicate its motion to a magnetic needle suspended over it, which he called \"magnetism of rotation\" but (after Faraday's explanation of 1832) is now known as eddy current. Arago is also fairly entitled to be regarded as having proved the long-suspected connexion between the aurora borealis and the variations of the magnetic elements. In 1827 he was elected an associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, when that institute became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851, he became foreign member. In 1828, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nIn optics, Arago not only made important optical discoveries on his own, but is credited with stimulating the genius of Jean-Augustin Fresnel, with whose history, as well as that of \u00c9tienne-Louis Malus and Thomas Young, this part of his life is closely interwoven.\nShortly after the beginning of the 19th century the labours of at least three philosophers were shaping the doctrine of the undulatory, or wave, theory of light. Fresnel's arguments in favour of that theory found little favour with Laplace, Poisson and Biot, the champions of the emission theory; but they were ardently espoused by Humboldt and by Arago, who had been appointed by the Academy to report on the paper. This was the foundation of an intimate friendship between Arago and Fresnel, and of a determination to carry on together further fundamental laws of the polarization of light known by their means. As a result of this work, Arago constructed a polariscope, which he used for some interesting observations on the polarization of the light of the sky. He also discovered the power of rotatory polarization exhibited by quartz.\nAmong Arago's many contributions to the support of the undulatory hypothesis, comes the \"experimentum crucis\" which he proposed to carry out for measuring directly the velocity of light in air and in water and glass. On the emission theory the velocity should be accelerated by an increase of density in the medium; on the wave theory, it should be retarded. In 1838 he communicated to the Academy the details of his apparatus, which utilized the relaying mirrors employed by Charles Wheatstone in 1835 for measuring the velocity of the electric discharge; but owing to the great care required in the carrying out of the project, and to the interruption to his labours caused by the revolution of 1848, it was the spring of 1850 before he was ready to put his idea to the test; and then his eyesight suddenly gave way. Before his death, however, the retardation of light in denser media was demonstrated by the experiments of H. L. Fizeau and B. L. Foucault, which, with improvements in detail, were based on the plan proposed by him.\nPolitics and legacy.\nIn 1830, Arago, who always professed liberal opinions of the republican type, was elected a member of the chamber of deputies for the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales \"d\u00e9partement\", and he employed his talents of eloquence and scientific knowledge in all questions connected with public education, the rewards of inventors, and the encouragement of the mechanical and practical sciences. Many of the most creditable national enterprises, dating from this period, are due to his advocacy \u2013 such as the grant for the publication of the works of Fermat and Laplace, the acquisition of the museum of Cluny, the development of railways and electric telegraphs, and the reward to Louis Daguerre for the invention of photography which, in 1839, Arago reported to stunned listeners of a joint meeting of the academies of Arts and Sciences.\nIn 1830, Arago also was appointed director of the Observatory, and as a member of the chamber of deputies he was able to obtain grants of money for rebuilding it in part, and for the addition of magnificent instruments. In the same year, too, he was chosen perpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences, the place of Joseph Fourier. Arago threw himself into its service, and by his faculty of making friends he gained at once for it and for himself a worldwide reputation. As perpetual secretary it was his duty to pronounce historical eulogies on deceased members; and for this duty his rapidity and facility of thought, and his happy piquancy of style, and his extensive knowledge peculiarly adapted him. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832.\nIn 1834, Arago again visited Scotland, to attend the meeting of the British Association at Edinburgh. From this time till 1848 he led a life of comparative quiet \u2013 although he continued to work within the Academy and the Observatory to produce a multitude of contributions to all departments of physical science \u2013 but on the fall of Louis-Philippe he left his laboratory to join the Provisional Government (24 February 1848). He was entrusted with two important functions, that had never before been given to one person, viz. the ministry of marine and colonies (24 February 1848\u00a0\u2013 11 May 1848) and ministry of war (5 April 1848\u00a0\u2013 11 May 1848); in the former capacity he improved rations in the navy and abolished flogging. He also abolished political oaths of all kinds and, against an array of moneyed interests, succeeded in procuring the abolition of slavery in the French colonies.\nOn 10 May 1848, Arago was elected a member of the Executive Power Commission, a governing body of the French Republic. He was made President of the Executive Power Commission (11 May 1848) and served in this capacity as provisional head of state until 24 June 1848, when collective resignation of the commission was submitted to the National Constituent Assembly. At the beginning of May 1852, when the government of Louis Napoleon required an oath of allegiance from all its functionaries, Arago peremptorily refused, and sent in his resignation of his post as astronomer at the Bureau des Longitudes. This, however, the prince president declined to accept, and made \"an exception in favour of a savant whose works had thrown lustre on France, and whose existence the government would regret to embitter.\"\nCape Gregory in Oregon was named by Captain Cook on 12 March 1778 after Saint Gregory, the saint of that day; it was renamed Cape Arago after Fran\u00e7ois Arago.\nLast years.\nArago remained a consistent republican to the end, and after the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1852, though suffering first from diabetes, then from Bright's disease, complicated by dropsy, he resigned his post as astronomer rather than take the oath of allegiance. Napoleon III gave directions that the old man should be in no way disturbed, and should be left free to say and do what he liked. In the summer of 1853 Arago was advised by his physicians to try the effect of his native air, and he accordingly set out to the eastern Pyrenees, but this was ineffective and he died in Paris. His grave is at the famous P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Arago was an atheist.\nPublications.\nArago's works were published after his death under the direction J. A. Barral, in 17 vols., 8vo, 1854\u20131862 (); also separately his \"Astronomie populaire\", in 4 vols.; \"Notices biographiques\", in 3 vols.; \"Indices scientifiques\", in 5 vols.; \"Voyages scientifiques\", in 1 vol.; \"Grimoires scientifiques\", in 2 vols.; \"M\u00e9langes\", in I vol.; and \"Tables analytiques et documents importants (with portrait)\", in 1 vol.\nEnglish translations of the following portions of Arago's works have appeared:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Moreover, he predicted the Arago spot in his attempt to disprove the wave theory of Augustin-Jean Fresnel.\nBiography.\nPoisson was born in Pithiviers, now in Loiret, France, the son of Sim\u00e9on Poisson, an officer in the French Army.\nIn 1798, he entered the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, in Paris, as first in his year, and immediately began to attract the notice of the professors of the school, who left him free to make his own decisions as to what he would study. In his final year of study, less than two years after his entry, he published two memoirs: one on \u00c9tienne B\u00e9zout's method of elimination, the other on the number of integrals of a finite difference equation. This was so impressive that he was allowed to graduate in 1800 without taking the final examination. The latter of the memoirs was examined by Sylvestre-Fran\u00e7ois Lacroix and Adrien-Marie Legendre, who recommended that it should be published in the \"Recueil des savants \u00e9trangers\". an unprecedented honor for a youth of eighteen. This success at once procured entry for Poisson into scientific circles. Joseph-Louis Lagrange, whose lectures on the theory of functions he attended at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, recognized his talent early on and became his friend. Meanwhile, Pierre-Simon Laplace, in whose footsteps Poisson followed, regarded him almost as his son. The rest of his career until his death in Sceaux, near Paris, was occupied by the composition and publication of his many works and in fulfilling the duties of the numerous educational positions to which he was successively appointed.\nImmediately after finishing his studies at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, he was appointed \"r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur\" (teaching assistant) there, a position which he had occupied as an amateur while still a pupil in the school; for his schoolmates had made a custom of visiting him in his room after an unusually difficult lecture to hear him repeat and explain it. He was made deputy professor (\"professeur suppl\u00e9ant\") in 1802, and, in 1806 full professor succeeding Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier, whom Napoleon had sent to Grenoble. In 1808 he became astronomer to the Bureau des Longitudes; and when the Facult\u00e9 des sciences de Paris was instituted in 1809 he was appointed a professor of rational mechanics (\"professeur de m\u00e9canique rationelle\"). He went on to become a member of the Institute in 1812, examiner at the military school (\"\u00c9cole Militaire\") at Saint-Cyr in 1815, graduation examiner at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 1816, councillor of the university in 1820, and geometer to the Bureau des Longitudes succeeding Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1827.\nIn 1817, he married Nancy de Bardi and with her, he had four children. His father, whose early experiences had led him to hate aristocrats, bred him in the stern creed of the First Republic. Throughout the Revolution, the Empire, and the following restoration, Poisson was not interested in politics, concentrating instead on mathematics. He was appointed to the dignity of baron in 1825, but he neither took out the diploma nor used the title. In March 1818, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, in 1822 a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 1823 a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The revolution of July 1830 threatened him with the loss of all his honours; but this disgrace to the government of Louis-Philippe was adroitly averted by Fran\u00e7ois Jean Dominique Arago, who, while his \"revocation\" was being plotted by the council of ministers, procured him an invitation to dine at the Palais-Royal, where he was openly and effusively received by the citizen king, who \"remembered\" him. After this, of course, his degradation was impossible, and seven years later he was made a peer of France, not for political reasons, but as a representative of French science.\nAs a teacher of mathematics Poisson is said to have been extraordinarily successful, as might have been expected from his early promise as a \"r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur\" at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. Notwithstanding his many official duties, he found time to publish more than three hundred works, several of them extensive treatises, and many of them memoirs dealing with the most abstruse branches of pure mathematics, applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and rational mechanics. (Arago attributed to him the quote, \"Life is good for only two things: doing mathematics and teaching it.\")\nA list of Poisson's works, drawn up by himself, is given at the end of Arago's biography. All that is possible is a brief mention of the more important ones. It was in the application of mathematics to physics that his greatest services to science were performed. Perhaps the most original, and certainly the most permanent in their influence, were his memoirs on the theory of electricity and magnetism, which virtually created a new branch of mathematical physics.\nNext (or in the opinion of some, first) in importance stand the memoirs on celestial mechanics, in which he proved himself a worthy successor to Pierre-Simon Laplace. The most important of these are his memoirs \"Sur les in\u00e9galit\u00e9s s\u00e9culaires des moyens mouvements des plan\u00e8tes\", \"Sur la variation des constantes arbitraires dans les questions de m\u00e9canique\", both published in the \"Journal\" of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique (1809); \"Sur la libration de la lune\", in \"Connaissance des temps\" (1821), etc.; and http://, in \"M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie\" (1827), etc. In the first of these memoirs, Poisson discusses the famous question of the stability of the planetary orbits, which had already been settled by Lagrange to the first degree of approximation for the disturbing forces. Poisson showed that the result could be extended to a second approximation, and thus made an important advance in planetary theory. The memoir is remarkable inasmuch as it roused Lagrange, after an interval of inactivity, to compose in his old age one of the greatest of his memoirs, entitled \"Sur la th\u00e9orie des variations des \u00e9l\u00e9ments des plan\u00e8tes, et en particulier des variations des grands axes de leurs orbites\". So highly did he think of Poisson's memoir that he made a copy of it with his own hand, which was found among his papers after his death. Poisson made important contributions to the theory of attraction.\nAs a tribute to Poisson's scientific work, which stretched to more than 300 publications, he was awarded a French peerage in 1837.\nHis is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.\nContributions.\nPotential theory.\nPoisson's equation.\nIn the theory of potentials, Poisson's equation, \n formula_1\nis a well-known generalization of Laplace's equation of the second order partial differential equation formula_2 for potential formula_3. \nIf formula_4 is a continuous function and if for formula_5 (or if a point 'moves' to infinity) a function formula_6 goes to 0 fast enough, the solution of Poisson's equation is the Newtonian potential\nformula_7\nwhere formula_8 is a distance between a volume element formula_9and a point formula_10. The integration runs over the whole space.\nPoisson's equation was first published in the \"Bulletin de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 philomatique\" (1813). Poisson's two most important memoirs on the subject are \"Sur l'attraction des sph\u00e9roides\" (Connaiss. ft. temps, 1829), and \"Sur l'attraction d'un ellipsoide homog\u00e8ne\" (Mim. ft. l'acad., 1835).\nPoisson discovered that Laplace's equation is valid only outside of a solid. A rigorous proof for masses with variable density was first given by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1839. Poisson's equation is applicable in not just gravitation, but also electricity and magnetism.\nElectricity and magnetism.\nAs the eighteenth century came to a close, human understanding of electrostatics approached maturity. Benjamin Franklin had already established the notion of electric charge and the conservation of charge; Charles-Augustin de Coulomb had enunciated his inverse-square law of electrostatics. In 1777, Joseph-Louis Lagrange introduced the concept of a potential function that can be used to compute the gravitational force of an extended body. In 1812, Poisson adopted this idea and obtained the appropriate expression for electricity, which relates the potential function formula_11 to the electric charge density formula_12. Poisson's work on potential theory inspired George Green's 1828 paper, \"An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism\".\nIn 1820, Hans Christian \u00d8rsted demonstrated that it was possible to deflect a magnetic needle by closing or opening an electric circuit nearby, resulting in a deluge of published papers attempting to explain the phenomenon. Amp\u00e8re's law and the Biot-Savart law were quickly deduced. The science of electromagnetism was born. Poisson was also investigating the phenomenon of magnetism at this time, though he insisted on treating electricity and magnetism as separate phenomena. He published two memoirs on magnetism in 1826. By the 1830s, a major research question in the study of electricity was whether or not electricity was a fluid or fluids distinct from matter, or something that simply acts on matter like gravity. Coulomb, Amp\u00e8re, and Poisson thought that electricity was a fluid distinct from matter. In his experimental research, starting with electrolysis, Michael Faraday sought to show this was not the case. Electricity, Faraday believed, was a part of matter.\nOptics.\nPoisson was a member of the academic \"old guard\" at the Acad\u00e9mie royale des sciences de l'Institut de France, who were staunch believers in the particle theory of light and were skeptical of its alternative, the wave theory. In 1818, the Acad\u00e9mie set the topic of their prize as diffraction. One of the participants, civil engineer and opticist Augustin-Jean Fresnel submitted a thesis explaining diffraction derived from analysis of both the Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle and Young's double slit experiment.\nPoisson studied Fresnel's theory in detail and looked for a way to prove it wrong. Poisson thought that he had found a flaw when he demonstrated that Fresnel's theory predicts an on-axis bright spot in the shadow of a circular obstacle blocking a point source of light, where the particle-theory of light predicts complete darkness. Poisson argued this was absurd and Fresnel's model was wrong. (Such a spot is not easily observed in everyday situations, because most everyday sources of light are not good point sources.)\nThe head of the committee, Dominique-Fran\u00e7ois-Jean Arago, performed the experiment. He molded a 2\u00a0mm metallic disk to a glass plate with wax. To everyone's surprise he observed the predicted bright spot, which vindicated the wave model. Fresnel won the competition.\nAfter that, the corpuscular theory of light was dead, but was revived in the twentieth century in a different form, wave-particle duality. Arago later noted that the diffraction bright spot (which later became known as both the Arago spot and the Poisson spot) had already been observed by Joseph-Nicolas Delisle and Giacomo F. Maraldi a century earlier.\nPure mathematics and statistics.\nIn pure mathematics, Poisson's most important works were his series of memoirs on definite integrals and his discussion of Fourier series, the latter paving the way for the classic researches of Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and Bernhard Riemann on the same subject; these are to be found in the \"Journal\" of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique from 1813 to 1823, and in the \"Memoirs de l'Acad\u00e9mie\" for 1823. He also studied Fourier integrals.\nPoisson wrote an essay on the calculus of variations (\"Mem. de l'acad.,\" 1833), and memoirs on the probability of the mean results of observations (\"Connaiss. d. temps,\" 1827, &amp;c). The Poisson distribution in probability theory is named after him.\nIn 1820 Poisson studied integrations along paths in the complex plane, becoming the first person to do so.\nIn 1829, Poisson published a paper on elastic bodies that contained a statement and proof of a special case of what became known as the divergence theorem.\nMechanics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Hlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAnalytical mechanics and the calculus of variations.\nFounded mainly by Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange in the eighteenth century, the calculus of variations saw further development and applications in the nineteenth.\nLetformula_13where formula_14. Then formula_15 is extremized if formula_16 satisfies the Euler\u2013Lagrange equationsformula_17But if formula_15 depends on higher-order derivatives of formula_19, that is, if formula_20then formula_21 must satisfy the Euler\u2013Poisson equation,formula_22Poisson's http:// (2 vols. 8vo, 1811 and 1833) was written in the style of Laplace and Lagrange and was long a standard work.\nLet formula_23 be the position, formula_24 be the kinetic energy, formula_11 the potential energy, both independent of time formula_26. Lagrange's equation of motion readsformula_27Here, the dot notation for the time derivative is used, formula_28. Poisson set formula_29. He argued that if formula_11 is independent of formula_31, he could writeformula_32giving formula_33He introduced an explicit formula for momenta,formula_34Thus, from the equation of motion, he gotformula_35Poisson's text influenced the work of William Rowan Hamilton and Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. A translation of Poisson's https:// was published in London in 1842. \nIn a paper read at the Institut de France in 1809, Poisson introduced a bracket now named after him. Let formula_36 and formula_37 be functions of the canonical variables of motion formula_38 and formula_39. Then their Poisson bracket is given byformula_40Evidently, the operation anti-commutes. More precisely, formula_41. By Hamilton's equations of motion, the total time derivative of formula_42 isformula_43where formula_44 is the Hamiltonian. In terms of Poisson brackets, then, Hamilton's equations can be written as formula_45 and formula_46. Suppose formula_36 is a constant of motion, then it must satisfyformula_48Moreover, Poisson's theorem states the Poisson bracket of any two constants of motion is also a constant of motion. Poisson had introduced his brackets while attempting to integrate the equations of motion resulting from the theory of perturbations for planetary orbits. But it was Jacobi who first recognized their utility in theoretical mechanics. In a series of lectures on dynamics delivered at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg during the 1842-43 academic year, Jacobi also presented his identity for Poisson brackets, which can be used to prove Poisson's theorem.\nIn September 1925, Paul Dirac received proofs of a seminal paper by Werner Heisenberg on the new branch of physics known as quantum mechanics. Soon he realized that the key idea in Heisenberg's paper was the anti-commutativity of dynamical variables and remembered that the analogous mathematical construction in classical mechanics was Poisson brackets. He found the treatment he needed in E. T. Whittaker's \"Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies\".\nContinuum mechanics and fluid flow.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Unsolved/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnsolved problem in physics\nUnder what conditions do solutions to the Navier\u2013Stokes equations exist and are smooth? This is a Millennium Prize Problem in mathematics.\nMore unsolved problems in physics\nIn 1821, using an analogy with elastic bodies, Claude-Louis Navier arrived at the basic equations of motion for viscous fluids, now identified as the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. In 1829 Poisson independently obtained the same result. George Gabriel Stokes re-derived them in 1845 using continuum mechanics. Poisson, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, and Sophie Germain were the main contributors to the theory of elasticity in the nineteenth century. The calculus of variations was frequently used to solve problems.\nWave propagation.\nPoisson also published a memoir on the theory of waves (M\u00e9m. ft. l'acad., 1825).\nThermodynamics.\nIn his work on heat conduction, Joseph Fourier maintained that the arbitrary function may be represented as an infinite trigonometric series and made explicit the possibility of expanding functions in terms of Bessel functions and Legendre polynomials, depending on the context of the problem. It took some time for his ideas to be accepted as his use of mathematics was less than rigorous. Although initially skeptical, Poisson adopted Fourier's method. From around 1815 he studied various problems in heat conduction. He published his http:// in 1835.\nDuring the early 1800s, Pierre-Simon de Laplace developed a sophisticated, if speculative, description of gases based on the old caloric theory of heat, to which younger scientists such as Poisson were less committed. A success for Laplace was his correction of Newton's formula for the speed of sound in air that gives satisfactory answers when compared with experiments. The Newton\u2013Laplace formula makes use of the specific heats of gases at constant volume formula_49and at constant pressure formula_50. In 1823 Poisson redid his teacher's work and reached the same results without resorting to complex hypotheses previously employed by Laplace. In addition, by using the gas laws of Robert Boyle and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, Poisson obtained the equation for gases undergoing adiabatic changes, namely formula_51, where formula_52 is the pressure of the gas, formula_11 its volume, and formula_54.\nOther works.\nBesides his many memoirs, Poisson published a number of treatises, most of which were intended to form part of a great work on mathematical physics, which he did not live to complete. Among these may be mentioned:\nInteraction with \u00c9variste Galois.\nAfter political activist \u00c9variste Galois had returned to mathematics after his expulsion from the \u00c9cole Normale, Poisson asked him to submit his work on the theory of equations, which he did January 1831. In early July, Poisson declared Galois' work \"incomprehensible,\" but encouraged Galois to \"publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion.\" While Poisson's report was made before Galois' 14 July arrest, it took until October to reach Galois in prison. It is unsurprising, in the light of his character and situation at the time, that Galois vehemently decided against publishing his papers through the academy and instead publish them privately through his friend Auguste Chevalier. Yet Galois did not ignore Poisson's advice. He began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison, and continued polishing his ideas until his release on\u00a029 April 1832, after which he was somehow persuaded to participate in what proved to be a fatal duel.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term Limpopo is derived from Rivombo (Livombo/Lebombo), a group of Tsonga settlers led by Hosi Rivombo who settled in the mountainous vicinity and named the area after their leader. The river has been called the Vhembe by local Venda communities of the area where now that name has been adopted by the South African government as its District Municipality in the north, a name that was also suggested in 2002 as a possible title for the province but was voted against. The river is approximately long, with a drainage basin of in size. The mean discharge measured over a year is to at its mouth. The Limpopo is the second largest African river that drains to the Indian Ocean, after the Zambezi River.\nThe first European to sight the river was Vasco da Gama, who anchored off its mouth in 1498 and named it (lit.\u2009'River of the Holy Spirit'). Its lower course was explored by St Vincent Whitshed Erskine in 1868\u201369, and Captain J F Elton travelled down its middle course in 1870.\nThe drainage area of Limpopo River has decreased over geological time. Up to Late Pliocene or Pleistocene times, the upper course of the Zambezi River drained into the Limpopo River. The change of the drainage divide is the result of epeirogenic movement that uplifted the surface north of present-day Limpopo River, diverting waters into Zambezi River.\nCourse.\nThe river flows in a great arc, first zigzagging north and then north-east, then turning east and finally south-east. It serves as a border for about , separating South Africa to the southeast from Botswana to the northwest and Zimbabwe to the north. At the confluence of the Marico River and the Crocodile River, the name becomes the Limpopo River. There are several rapids as the river falls off Southern Africa's inland escarpment.\nThe Notwane River is a major tributary of the Limpopo, rising on the edge of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana and flowing in a north-easterly direction. The main tributary of the Limpopo, the Olifants River (Elephant River), contributes around 1,233 million\u00a0m3 of water per year. Other major tributaries include the Shashe River, Mzingwane River, Crocodile River, Mwenezi River and Luvuvhu River.\nIn the north-eastern corner of South Africa the river borders the Kruger National Park. The port town of Xai-Xai, Mozambique, is on the river near the mouth. Below the Olifants, the river is navigable to the sea, though a sandbar prevents access by large ships except at high tide.\nBasin characteristics.\nThe waters of the Limpopo flow sluggishly, with considerable silt content. Rudyard Kipling's characterization of the river as the \"great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees\", where the \"Bi-Coloured Python Rock-Snake\" dwells in the \"Just So Stories\" is apt. Rainfall is seasonal and unreliable: in dry years, the upper parts of the river flow for 40 days or less. The upper part of the drainage basin, in the Kalahari Desert, is arid but conditions become less arid further downriver. The next reaches drain the Waterberg Massif, a biome of semi-deciduous forest and low-density human population. The fertile lowlands support a denser population, and about 14\u00a0million people live in the Limpopo basin. Flooding during the rainy season is an occasional problem in the lower reaches. During February 2000 heavy rainfalls during the passage of a cyclone caused the catastrophic 2000 Mozambique flood.\nThe highest concentration of hippopotamus in the Limpopo River is found between the Mokolo and the Mogalakwena Rivers. There is a lot of mining activity in the Limpopo River basin with about 1,900 functioning mines, not counting about 1,700 abandoned mines.\nHistory.\nVasco da Gama, on his first expedition, was probably among the first Europeans to sight the river, when he anchored off the mouth in 1498. However, there has been human habitation in the region since time immemorial\u2014sites in the Makapans Valley near Mokopane contain Australopithecus fossils from 3.5 million years ago. St Vincent Whitshed Erskine, later surveyor general for South Africa, traveled to the mouth of the river in 1868\u201369.\nA Zambezi shark was caught hundreds of kilometres upriver at the confluence of the Limpopo and Luvuvhu Rivers in July 1950. Zambezi sharks tolerate fresh water and can travel far up the Limpopo. In 2013, approximately 15,000 Nile crocodiles were accidentally released into the river from flood gates at the nearby Rakwena Crocodile Farm.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the country's largest urban centre north of Gauteng. It was one of the nine host cities of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nIn the 1840s, Voortrekkers under the leadership of Andries Hendrik Potgieter established Zoutpansbergdorp, a town to the north. This settlement had to be abandoned because of clashes with the local tribes (Lebelo, Langa &amp; Ledwaba clans), they founded a new town in 1886 and named it \"Pietersburg\" in honour of Voortrekker leader Petrus Jacobus Joubert. A small number of Indian/Asian and coloured people settled into the region before the end of the 19th century. It was the capital of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State for a short time in 1900 during the Second Boer War. The British occupied Pietersburg in 1901 and built a concentration camp to incarcerate almost 4,000 Boer women and children. \nYears of apartheid.\nLike many places in South Africa at the time of apartheid, racial segregation and inequality were fundamentally ingrained into the town, following the end of the Second Boer War, together with the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, institutional laws were in place in terms of divided urban planning which were implemented continuously throughout this era. The commencement of apartheid in 1948 meant that Pietersburg was clearly segregated in both residential regions and for business ventures. \nThe institutionalization of the notorious Group Areas Act in 1950 and its amendments in 1966 ensured that the spatial development of the Central Business District (CBD) was exclusively for whites and other regions of the CBD being exclusively for other races such as \"Indian centre\" for Indians/Asians, many regions were designated to only a specific race of people such as the suburbs of Nirvana and Westernburg at the northwest of the town only being occupied by Indian/Asian and Coloured groups respectively, while the suburb of Bendor being reserved for Whites. The townships of Seshego and Mankweng were occupied by the Black population. Removals of minority groups for white residency, whites-only owned industrial sectors and a regular barrier between people of different races were heavily enforced.\nSince 1994.\nThe town officially became a city on 23 April 1992 and on 27 April 1994, it became the capital of the newly formed Northern Transvaal province (Later changed to \"Northern province\" and thereafter Limpopo) following the 1994 South African general elections. On 25 February 2005, the government declared the official name of the city as Polokwane, a name that was generally in use by the speakers of Northern Sotho (Sepedi). The city was host to the 52nd national conference of the African National Congress, held in December 2007 at the University of Limpopo and saw Jacob Zuma voted as President of the ANC, beating former president Thabo Mbeki. \nToday the city of Polokwane has seen respectable development in terms of its infrastructure and services as provides a wide variety of shopping venues and malls, restaurants, entertainment venues, religious venues, civic halls, as well as modern housing developments and office buildings.\nPolitical governance.\nThe Polokwane Municipality is run by the African National Congress (ANC) with a 60% majority obtained in the latest 2021 Municipal Elections. In a by-election held on 24 April 2024, Ward 10 was won by ANC councillor candidate https:// after the arrest and resignation of the previous Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) councillor Jacob Seshokadue due to alleged theft of firearms.\nDemographics.\nThe population in 2011 was about 130,000 . Roughly 45.9% of people in the city are Sepedi (Northern Sotho) speakers. A large portion of the white population are Afrikaners, and roughly 10,000 residents (roughly 8%) are English-speaking whites who are primarily South Africans of British descent and White Zimbabweans, the latter of whom primarily moved to the area since 2000. Roughly 6.7% of people are Venda people.\nDistricts/suburbs/townships.\nThe city is divided into seven clusters and forty-five wards.\nSome suburbs in the city include Nirvana, Westenburg, Bendor, Welgelegen, Moregloed, Annadale, Ivydale, Flora Park, Fauna Park, Greenside, Penina Park, Ivy Park, Hospital Park, Ster Park, Dalmada, Broadlands, Woodlands, Southern Gateway and Thornhill.\nBesides the above-mentioned suburbs in the city, four of the clusters represent suburbs around the city:\nClimate.\nThe city features a semiarid climate under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Despite its position on the Tropic of Capricorn, the climate is tempered by its position on a plateau 1230\u00a0m above sea level. Average temperatures reach around in January and fall to in July. As with much of inland South Africa, Polokwane has experienced notably warmer seasons over the last decade than its long-term average.\nThe city has a dry climate with a summer rainy season and a pronounced dry spell during winter. Average annual rainfall is , with December or (less often) January the wettest month and July the driest.\nTransport.\nRoads.\nThe city lies roughly halfway between Gauteng () and the Zimbabwean border () on the N1 highway, which connects Zimbabwe with the major cities of South Africa, such as Pretoria, Johannesburg, Bloemfontein, and Cape Town.\nThe R37 provincial route connects the city with Mbombela. Running east, the R71 connects the city with Tzaneen, Phalaborwa, Bushbuckridge, and the Kruger National Park. To north-east, is the R81 connecting the city with Giyani and Malamulele. The R521 connects the city with Alldays and the R567 via Seshego connects Polokwane with the N11. The R71 is also well known to bikers who ride through the city annually, making it the biggest bike meeting in Africa.\nThe Nelson Mandela road traffic island is situated on the outskirts of Polokwane when approaching from the direction of Johannesburg. It was built prior to the 2010 FIFA World Cup as part of beautifying the city for the event.\nA number of private bus services run in the city and also services connect Polokwane to other major centres in the country.\nAir.\nThe city is served by two airports. A public airport, the Polokwane International Airport, () which is to the north of the city, while the smaller Pietersburg Civil Aerodrome () is at the south-east of the city. \n \n \n \nRailways.\nThe city is connected to Johannesburg and other major centres by rail. Agricultural produce in the area, including tomatoes, citrus fruit, sugar cane, peanuts, tea, bananas, and avocados, is also transported by freight rail.\nSociety and culture.\nMedia.\nThe South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has a branch in the city. The city also hosts a branch of the country's largest independent radio station, Jacaranda RM/FM, which is broadcast from either Pretoria, Nelspruit or Polokwane itself.\nThe first commercial radio station in Limpopo, CapricornFM, broadcasts from the city. Two additional radio stations are also situated in Polokwane. These include \"Energy FM\" and Munghana Lonene FM.\nThe city has a selection of locally distributed newspapers. Two notable newspapers include \"The Review\" and \"The Polokwane Observer\".\nGambling.\nThe Sun International casino and hotel is in the city. Meropa Casino and Entertainment World is a Moroccan-style, 24-hour casino with various outdoor entertainment amenities such as go-karts, minigolf, and a wildlife park.\nPlaces of worship.\nThe largest Christian gathering in South Africa happens twice a year at Zion City, Moria near Polokwane, at Easter and again for the September end of year festival. The Zion Christian Church's headquarters are at Zion City Moria, about 25 kilometres east of the city. ZCC is an entirely black denomination with about 16 million members formed in 1924 by Ignatius Lekganyane - an indigenous church, not established by evangelists from abroad. The Star of David is the symbol of the ZCC and the two congregations that make up the church are today led by the grandsons of its founder - Barnabas Lekganyane and Saint Engenas Lekganyane. The ZCC is characterised by the emphasis it places on faith healing, purification rites, dancing, night communion, river baptism, the holy spirit, taboos and prophesying. The church celebrated its 100th year of existence during their September pilgrimage in 2024 which was attended by provincial government leadership, kings, chiefs, congregates and other dignitaries. The ZCC has members in every country in Africa, and in most countries of the Middle East.\nSynagogues.\nThe first Jewish settlers in Pietersburg arrived between 1890 and 1900 from Lithuania, Russia, and Latvia, and the Pietersburg Hebrew Congregation was founded in 1897. A synagogue was built on Jorissen Street in 1921. The Jewish community grew rapidly in the 1930s and 1940s; a larger synagogue was built in 1953 and the old synagogue was then converted into a communal hall. The number of Jews in Pietersburg began to decline from the late 1950s. In 2003, as the congregation had dwindled, the synagogue was closed and its benches, bimah, and other contents were shipped to Israel, where they were installed in the Mevasser Synagogue in Tel Mond in memory of the Pietersburg synagogue.\nSports.\nFootball.\nPolokwane City and Baroka are soccer clubs based in the city.\nGolf.\nThe Pietersburg Golf Club along with the golf course was established in the late 1800s. The course comprises a full 18 holes. Retief Goosen (born 3 February 1969) was born in Pietersburg and honed his skills at the Pietersburg Golf Club.\nCricket.\nThe Polokwane Cricket Club is one of the oldest in the country and was established in 1902. Limpopo's cricket team, which plays first-class and List A cricket, is based in Polokwane at the Polokwane Cricket Club Ground.\nThe city's suburb of Nirvana holds an annual cricket competition called the \"Nirvana Premier League\" in which teams from all around the city and the province take part in.\nNetball.\nThe Limpopo Baobabs represents the city as well as the province of Limpopo in the Telkom Netball League. Lenize Potgieter was also born in Polokwane.\nRugby.\nNoordelikes Rugby Club is an amateur rugby club based in the city.\nFrom 2013 to 2015, the city hosted a provincial team, the Limpopo Blue Bulls, in the Vodacom Cup, as a feeder team to the Blue Bulls of Pretoria. The team broke several unwanted records, including the biggest first class loss in South African rugby history, when they lost 161\u20133 to the on 27 April 2013.\nSpringbok rugby captain, Victor Matfield grew up in Pietersburg.\nFormer Springbok rugby captain John Smit was born in Pietersburg.\nSwimming.\nThe city has a number of swimming clubs. Former Olympic gold-medalist and world-record swimmer Lyndon Ferns is from the city.\nTennis.\nA large tennis club is situated in the city, and various local tournaments are held regularly.\nBaseball.\nIn 2017, Gift Ngoepe, born in Pietersburg, became the first African player in the Major League Baseball, playing shortstop and second base for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Ngoepe's mother Maureen managed the baseball clubhouse in Randburg, near Johannesburg. Ngoepe's brother Victor also plays in the Pirates' farm system\nTourism.\nThe city provides access to various nature and wildlife viewing opportunities for ecotourists. The Polokwane Bird and Reptile Park is home to over 280 species of birds. The Polokwane Game Reserve houses various South African species of wildlife, birdlife, and plants in an unspoiled bushveld environment. The Moletzie Bird Sanctuary protects rare birds like the Cape vulture. The Modjadji Rainforest near Duiwelskloof holds the largest concentration of indigenous cycads in the world, and Cheune Crocodile Farm provides a place to learn about the life of crocodiles.\nAn extensive art collection is preserved in the city's art gallery, open to the public. The city has more public sculptures per capita in its parks than elsewhere in South Africa. It was also the first city to unveil a bust of the ex-president Nelson Mandela in its City Square (Civic Gardens), and it was authorised by Nelson Mandela personally.\nThe city is considered the premier hunting destination in South Africa.\n \n \n \nCommerce.\nThe city hosts several major industries such as Coca-Cola, Freshmark (a division of Shoprite Checkers), and South African Breweries. As the capital of the Limpopo province, the city also has a large commercial area with the four largest banks in the country all having at least three branches in the city.\nThe city was well known for its manufacturing facility in Seshego of Tempest radios and hi-fis, the largest employer in the region.\nEducation.\nTertiary education.\nThe Tshwane University of Technology, Capricorn TVET College, and the University of South Africa have satellite campuses in the city. The University of Limpopo's Turfloop campus is situated about 30\u00a0km east of Polokwane.\nSister cities.\nPolokwane is a sister city with:\nCoats of arms.\nMunicipal (1).\nBy 1931, the Pietersburg municipal council had assumed a pseudo-heraldic \"coat of arms\". The shield depicted a crossed pick and shovel, two crossed wheatsheaves, and the date 1904 surrounded by a ribbon and bearing the motto . The crest was an ostrich.\nMunicipal (2).\nA proper coat of arms was designed in the 1960s. It was registered with the Transvaal Provincial Administration in August 1967 and at the Bureau of Heraldry in September 1969.\nThe arms were : \"Azure, on a fess Argent, between in chief a lion passant Argent, armed and langued Gules, and in base two chevrons humette, and a horseshoe Argent, placed 2 and 1, two cogwheels Gules\". In layman's terms, this was a blue shield displaying, from top to bottom, a silver lion with red tongue and claws, a silver stripe bearing two red cogwheels, and two silver chevrons and a horseshoe.\nThe crest was a golden eagle, and the motto, once again, was \"Labor omnia vincit\".\nMunicipal (3).\nThe Pietersburg municipal council registered a new coat of arms at the Bureau in October 2003.\nThe arms are: \"Vert, on a fess Argent, a woven grain basket, between two hoes with blades turned inward proper, their handles towards centre-base counterchanged Or and issuant from a voided cogwheel the inner ring cotised Argent, therein a sun Or; on a chief of the last a short-clawed Lark (\"Mirafra chuana\") perched upon a leaf of the silky thorn tree (\"Acacia rehmanniana\") proper, between two demi-peaks with points embattled Brunatre, issuant from the respective shield flanks\". In layman's terms, the shield depicts, from top to bottom, (1) a short-clawed lark perched on an acacia leaf between two stylised peaks, (2) a woven grain basket between two hoes on a silver background, and (3) a silver cogwheel on a green background.\nAbove the shield is a brown rustic crown. The motto is \"Unity - Equity - Progress - Prosperity\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name derives from the French House of Bourbon, although the precise source of inspiration is uncertain; contenders include Bourbon County, Kentucky, and Bourbon Street in New Orleans, both of which are named after the House of Bourbon. The name \"bourbon\" might not have been used until the 1850s, and the association with Bourbon County was not evident until the 1870s.\nAlthough bourbon may be made anywhere in the U.S., it is associated with the Southern United States, particularly Kentucky, through a history of advertising bourbon as a product of Kentucky with rural, Southern origins. Thanks to a market shift in the 1990s, it has also become a symbol of urbanization and sophistication, with a large consumer demographic belonging to the middle- to upper-class, including business and community leaders.\nAfter World War II, a boom in bourbon consumption and exports occurred. Bourbon was recognized in 1964 by the U.S. Congress as a \"distinctive product of the United States.\" Bourbon sold in the U.S. must be produced within the U.S. from at least 51% corn and stored in a new container of charred oak.\nBourbon has been distilled since the 18th century. As of 2014[ [update]], distillers' wholesale market revenue for bourbon sold within the U.S. was about $2.7\u00a0billion, and bourbon made up about two thirds of the $1.6\u00a0billion of U.S. exports of distilled spirits. According to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, in 2018 U.S. distillers derived $3.6\u00a0billion in revenue from bourbon and Tennessee whiskey (a closely related spirit produced in the state of Tennessee).\nHistory.\nDistilling was most likely brought to present-day Kentucky in the late 18th century by Scots, Scots-Irish, and other settlers (including English, Irish, Welsh, German, and French) who began to farm the area. The origin of bourbon as a distinct form of whiskey is not well documented and there are many conflicting legends and claims.\nFor example, the invention of bourbon is often attributed to Elijah Craig, a Baptist minister and distiller credited with many Kentucky firsts (e.g., fulling mill, paper mill, ropewalk) who is said to have been the first to age the product in charred oak casks, a process that gives bourbon its brownish color and distinctive taste. In Bourbon County, across the county line from Craig's distillery in what was then Fayette County, an early distiller named Jacob Spears has been named as the first to label his product as Bourbon whiskey. Although still popular and often repeated, the Craig legend is apocryphal. Similarly, the Spears story is a local favorite but is rarely repeated outside the county. There likely was no single \"inventor\" of bourbon, which developed into its present form in the late 19th century. Essentially, any type of grain can be used to make whiskey, and the practice of aging whiskey and charring the barrels for better flavor had been known in Europe for centuries. The late date of the Bourbon County etymology has led historian Michael Veach to dispute its authenticity. He proposes the whiskey was named after Bourbon Street in New Orleans, a major port where shipments of Kentucky whiskey sold well as a cheaper alternative to French cognac.\nAnother proposed origin of the name is the association with the geographic area known as \"Old Bourbon\", consisting of the original Bourbon County in Virginia organized in 1785. This region included much of today's Eastern Kentucky, including 34 of the modern counties. It included the current Bourbon County in Kentucky, which became a county when Kentucky separated from Virginia as a new state in 1792. Numerous newspaper articles reference whiskey from Bourbon County, Kentucky dating as far back as 1824. According to the whiskey writer Charles K. Cowdery,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When American pioneers pushed west of the Allegheny Mountains following the American Revolution, the first counties they founded covered vast regions. One of these original, huge counties was Bourbon, established in 1785 and named after the French royal family. While this vast county was being carved into many smaller ones, early in the 19th century, many people continued to call the region \"Old Bourbon\". Located within \"Old Bourbon\" was the principal port on the Ohio River, Maysville, Kentucky, from which whiskey and other products were shipped. \"Old Bourbon\" was stencilled on the barrels to indicate their port of origin. \"Old Bourbon\" whiskey was different because it was the first corn whiskey most people had ever tasted. In time, \"bourbon\" became the name for any corn-based whiskey.\nA refinement often dubiously credited to James C. Crow is the sour mash process, which conditions each new fermentation with some amount of spent mash. Spent mash is also known as spent beer, distillers' spent grain, stillage, and slop or feed mash, so named because it is used as animal feed. The acid introduced when using the sour mash controls the growth of bacteria that could taint the whiskey and creates a proper pH balance for the yeast to work.\nAlthough many distilleries operated in Bourbon County historically, no distilleries operated there between 1919, when Prohibition began in Kentucky, and late 2014, when a small distillery opened\u00a0\u2013 a period of 95 years. Prohibition devastated the bourbon industry. With the ratification of the 18th amendment in 1919, all distilleries were forced to stop operating. Six companies were granted permits to bottle medicinal whiskey from existing stocks: A.\u00a0Ph.\u00a0Stitzel Distillery (later called the Stitzel\u2013Weller Distillery), American Medicinal Spirits (producer of Old Crow and Old Grand-Dad, sold in 1929 to National Distillers, now owned by Suntory Global Spirits), Brown-Forman (still a current major producer), Frankfort Distillery (including the George T. Stagg distillery now called the Buffalo Trace Distillery and owned by Sazerac), James Thompson and Brothers (later called Glenmore Distillery, now owned by Sazerac), and Schenley Distillery (now owned by Guinness). Prescriptions were required to buy medicinal whiskey. In 1928 or 1929 when stocks ran out, there was a 100-day \"distillers' holiday\" to replenish the medicinal stock.\nAfter the end of Prohibition at the federal level in late 1933, it continued in various places at the state, county and local level, and liquor sales are still prohibited or restricted in many jurisdictions in Kentucky, the primary bourbon-producing state (and in Tennessee as well, where Tennessee whiskey is made).\nProduction was shut down completely again in 1941 to reserve production capacity for making industrial alcohol during World War II.\nAccording to E. Kyle Romero, after World War II whiskey transitioned from a primarily domestic product to a major export product. The war introduced many American soldiers to whiskey, and veterans boosted a growing domestic demand. The postwar economic boom and the rise of consumer culture fueled whiskey's golden age in the 1950s and 1960s, solidifying its place in global markets. The Bourbon Institute, established in 1958, played a crucial role in reducing trade restrictions, particularly in Europe, further expanding whiskey's international reach. By 1960, the institute explicitly framed bourbon as a cultural ambassador of American identity, reinforcing the idea that its global presence reflected the broader influence of American ways and products.\nIn 1964, when Americans consumed around 77 million gallons of bourbon, a concurrent resolution adopted by the United States Congress in 1964 declared bourbon to be a \"distinctive product of the United States\" and asked \"the appropriate agencies of the United States Government ... [to] take appropriate action to prohibit importation into the United States of whiskey designated as 'Bourbon Whiskey'\". A U.S. federal regulation now restricts the definition of \"bourbon\" for whiskey to only include spirits produced in the U.S.\nIn recent years, bourbon and Tennessee whiskey, which is sometimes regarded as a different type of spirit but generally meets the legal requirements to be called bourbon, have enjoyed significant growth in popularity. The industry trade group Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS) tracks sales of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey together.\nAccording to DISCUS, during 2009\u20132014, the volume of 9-liter cases of whiskey increased by 28.5% overall. Higher-end bourbon and whiskeys experienced the greatest growth. Gross supplier revenues (including federal excise tax) for U.S. bourbon and Tennessee whiskey increased by 46.7% over the 2009\u20132014 period, with the greatest growth coming from high-end products. In 2014, more than 19\u00a0million nine-liter cases of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey were sold in the U.S., generating almost $2.7\u00a0billion in wholesale distillery revenue. U.S. exports of bourbon whiskey surpassed $1\u00a0billion for the first time in 2013; distillers hailed the rise of a \"golden age of Kentucky bourbon\" and predicted further growth. In 2014, it was estimated that U.S. bourbon whiskey exports surpassed $1\u00a0billion, making up the majority of the U.S. total of $1.6\u00a0billion in spirits exports. Major export markets for U.S. spirits are, in descending order: Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and France. The largest percentage increases in U.S. exports were, in descending order: Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Bahamas, Israel, and United Arab Emirates. Key elements of growth in the markets showing the largest increases have been changes of law, trade agreements, and reductions of tariffs, as well as increased consumer demand for premium-category spirits.\nLegal requirements.\nBourbon's legal definition varies somewhat from country to country, but many trade agreements require that the name \"bourbon\" be reserved for products made in the U.S. The U.S. regulations for labeling and advertising bourbon apply only to products made for consumption within the U.S.; they do not apply to distilled spirits made for export. Canadian law requires products labeled bourbon to be made in the U.S. and also to conform to the requirements that apply within the U.S. The European Union also requires bourbon to be made in the U.S. following the law of the country. However, in other countries, products labeled bourbon may not adhere to the same standards. For example, U.S.-produced products with somewhat lower alcohol content than the level required in the United States can be sold in Australia as bourbon, with Cougar Bourbon being an example of an export-only brand produced in the U.S. for the Australia market.\nThe Federal Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits, codified under 27 CFR \u00a75 Subpart I states that bourbon made for U.S. consumption must be:\nBourbon has no minimum specified duration for its aging period. Products aged for as little as three months are sold as bourbon. The exception is straight bourbon, which has a minimum aging requirement of two years. In addition, any bourbon aged less than four years must include an age statement on its label.\nBourbon that meets the above requirements, has been aged for a minimum of two years, and does not have added coloring, flavoring, or other spirits may be \u2013 but is not required to be \u2013 called straight bourbon.\nBottled in bond bourbon is a sub-category of straight bourbon that must be produced by a single distiller at a single distillery in a single season, aged at least four years in a bonded warehouse under federal control, and bottled at 100 proof (50% ABV).\nBourbon that is labeled \"blended\" (or as a \"blend\") may contain added coloring, flavoring, and other spirits, such as un-aged neutral grain spirits, but at least 51% of the product must be straight bourbon.\n\"High rye bourbon\" is not a legally defined term but usually means a bourbon with 20\u201335% rye in its mash bill. High-wheat or \"wheated\" bourbons are described as more mild and subdued compared to high-rye varieties.\nBourbon that has been aged for less than three years cannot legally be referred to as whiskey (or whisky) in the European Union.\nGeographic origin.\nOn May 4, 1964, the U.S. Congress declared bourbon whiskey as a \"distinctive product of the United States\" by concurrent resolution. Bourbon may be produced anywhere in the U.S. where it is legal to distill spirits, but most brands are produced in Kentucky, where bourbon production has a strong historical association. The filtering of iron-free water through the high concentrations of limestone that are unique to the area is often touted by bourbon distillers in Kentucky as a signature step in the bourbon-making process.\nOn August 2, 2007, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution sponsored by Senator Jim Bunning (R-KY) officially declaring September 2007 to be National Bourbon Heritage Month, commemorating the history of bourbon whiskey. Notably, the resolution claimed that Congress had declared bourbon to be \"America's Native Spirit\" in its 1964 resolution. However, the 1964 resolution did not contain such a statement; it declared bourbon to be a distinctive product identifiable with the U.S. (in a similar way that Scotch is considered identifiable with Scotland). The resolution was passed again in 2008.\nAs of 2018[ [update]], 95% of all bourbon is produced in Kentucky, according to the Kentucky Distillers' Association. As of 2018[ [update]], there were 68 whiskey distilleries in Kentucky, this was up 250 percent in the past ten years. At that time, the state had more than 8.1\u00a0million barrels of bourbon that were aging \u2013 a number that greatly exceeds the state's population of about 4.3\u00a0million.\nBardstown, Kentucky, is home to the annual Bourbon Festival held each September. It has been called the \"Bourbon Capital of the World\" by the Bardstown Tourism Commission and the Kentucky Bourbon Festival organizers who have registered the phrase as a trademark. The Kentucky Bourbon Trail is the name of a tourism promotion program organized by the Kentucky Distillers' Association that is aimed at attracting visitors to the distilleries in Kentucky, particularly Four Roses (Lawrenceburg), Heaven Hill (Bardstown), Jim Beam (Clermont), Maker's Mark (Loretto), Town Branch (Lexington), Wild Turkey (Lawrenceburg), and Woodford Reserve (Versailles).\nTennessee is home to other major bourbon makers, although most prefer to call their product \"Tennessee whiskey\" instead, including giant Jack Daniel's. It is legally defined under Tennessee House Bill 1084, the North American Free Trade Agreement and at least one other international trade agreement as the recognized name for a straight bourbon whiskey produced in Tennessee. It is also required to meet the legal definition of bourbon under Canadian law.\nAlthough some Tennessee whiskey makers maintain that a pre-aging filtration through chunks of maple charcoal, known as the Lincoln County Process and legally mandated since 2013, make its flavor distinct from bourbon, U.S. regulations defining bourbon neither require nor prohibit its use.\nBourbon also was and is made in other U.S. states. The largest bourbon distiller outside of Kentucky and Tennessee is MGP of Indiana, which primarily wholesales its spirits products to bottling companies that sell them under about 50 different brand names \u2013 in some cases, misleadingly marketed as \"craft\" whiskey, despite being produced at a large wholesaler's factory.\nProduction process.\nTo be legally sold as bourbon, the whiskey's mash bill requires a minimum of 51% corn, with the remainder being any cereal grain. A proposed change to U.S. regulations will expand allowable \"grains\" to include seeds of the pseudocereals amaranth, buckwheat, and quinoa. A mash bill that contains wheat instead of rye produces what is known as a wheated bourbon. \nThe grain is ground and mixed with water. Usually mash from a previous distillation is added to ensure consistency across batches, creating a sour mash. Finally, yeast is added, and the mash is fermented. It is distilled to (typically) between 65% and 80% alcohol using either a traditional alembic (or pot still) or the much less expensive continuous still. Most modern bourbons are initially run off using a column still and then redistilled in a \"doubler\" (alternatively known as a \"thumper\" or \"retort\") that is basically a pot still.\nThe resulting clear spirit, called \"white dog\", is placed in charred new oak containers for aging. In practice, these containers are generally barrels made from American white oak. The spirit gains its color and much of its flavor from the caramelized sugars and vanillins in the charred wood. Straight bourbon must be aged at least two years, and blended bourbon must contain at least 51% straight bourbon on a proof gallon basis (i.e., most of the alcohol in the blend must be from straight bourbon). Bourbons gain more color and flavor the longer they age in wood. Changes to the spirit also occur due to evaporation and chemical processes such as oxidation. Lower-priced bourbons tend to be aged relatively briefly. Even for higher-priced bourbons, \"maturity\" rather than a particular age duration is often the goal, as over-aging bourbons can negatively affect the flavor of the bourbon (making it taste woody, bitter, or unbalanced).\nThe remainder of the spirits in a blended bourbon may be neutral grain spirits that are not aged at all. If a product is labeled merely as bourbon whiskey rather than straight or blended, no specific minimum aging period is prescribed \u2013 only that the product has been \"stored at not more than 62.5% alcohol by volume (125 proof) in charred new oak containers\". \nAfter maturing, bourbon is withdrawn from the barrel and is typically filtered and diluted with water. It is then bottled at no less than 80 US proof (40% abv). Although most bourbon whiskey is sold at 80 proof, bourbon can be bottled much higher. All \"bottled in bond\" bourbon is 100 proof. Some higher-proof bottlings are marketed as \"barrel proof\" or \"cask strength\", meaning they have not been diluted or have been only slightly diluted (less than 1% ABV dilution) after removal from the barrels. Bourbon whiskey may be sold at less than 80 proof but must be labeled as \"diluted bourbon\". \nA very small number of bourbon bottlings have been released with exceptionally high proof, sometimes exceeding 140 proof (70% ABV). In the mid-2010s, some sources began referring to these as \"hazmat\" bourbons, alluding to the ban in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations on air travel passengers and crew members carrying such high-proof beverages due to their highly flammable nature. Such high proof levels are very uncommon even among \"barrel proof\" bourbons, as bourbon must enter the barrel at no higher than 125 proof and thus can only reach higher concentrations by disproportionate evaporation of water in the Angel's share during aging. Although only the focus of special attention for bourbon since the mid-2010s, very-high-proof products are not especially novel in general, as evidenced by the well-known Bacardi 151 brand of rum, which was available on the U.S. and Canadian markets from about 1963 until 2016 and was bottled at 75.5% ABV.\nAfter processing, barrels remain saturated with up to of bourbon, although is the norm. They may not be reused for bourbon, and most are sold to distilleries in Canada, Scotland, Ireland, Mexico, and the Caribbean for aging other spirits. Some are employed in the manufacture of various barrel-aged products, including amateur and professionally brewed bourbon barrel-aged beer, barbecue sauce, wine, hot sauce, and others. Since 2011, Jim Beam has employed barrel rinsing on a large scale to extract bourbon from its used barrels, mixing the extract with a 6-year-old Beam bourbon to create a 90-proof product that it sells as \"Devil's Cut\".\nThe bottling operation for bourbon is the process of filtering, mixing together straight whiskey from different barrels (sometimes from different distilleries), diluting with water, blending with other ingredients (if producing blended bourbon), and filling containers to produce the final product that is marketed to consumers. By itself, the phrase \"bottled by\" means only that. Only if the bottler operates the distillery that produced the whiskey may \"distilled by\" be added to the label.\nLabeling requirements for bourbon and other alcoholic beverages (including the requirements for what is allowed to be called bourbon under U.S. law) are defined in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations. No whiskey made outside the U.S. may be labeled bourbon or sold as bourbon inside the U.S. Various other countries have trade agreements with the U.S. to recognize bourbon as a distinctive product of the U.S., including Canada and Mexico, the United Kingdom, Chile, and Brazil.\nA 2016 experiment by Louisville craft distiller Jefferson's Bourbon suggests that in the era before whiskey was routinely bottled at the distillery, Kentucky bourbon developed a superior taste because it was shipped in barrels, using water transport wherever practical. To test this theory, Jefferson's cofounder Trey Zoeller sent two barrels of the company's signature product to New York City via barge, first down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and then along the Intracoastal Waterway. As a control, he brought a batch of the same whiskey that had remained in Louisville during the same period. According to \"Popular Mechanics\" writer Jacqueline Detwiler-George, who documented the test, the sample that made the waterborne journey \"was mature beyond its age, richer, with new flavors of tobacco, vanilla, caramel, and honey. It was some of the best bourbon any of us had ever drunk.\" It was theorized that the action of gentle sloshing of the whiskey in barrels for a period of 2 to 4 weeks during the barge trip led to a dramatic improvement in smoothness and taste. Chemical analysis of the two samples revealed significant differences in molecular profiles, with the sample transported by water having a greater diversity of aromatic compounds.\nUses.\nBourbon is served in a variety of manners, including neat; diluted with water; over ice (\"on the rocks\"); with cola or other beverages in simple mixed drinks; and in cocktails \u2013 including the Manhattan, the Old Fashioned, the whiskey sour, and the mint julep. Bourbon is also used in cooking, and it was historically used for medicinal purposes.\nBourbon can be used in a variety of confections such as a banana bourbon syrup for waffles, a flavoring for chocolate cake, and fruit-based desserts like grilled peach sundaes served with salted bourbon-caramel or brown sugar shortcake with warmed bourbon peaches. It is an optional ingredient in several pie recipes traditional to American cuisine, including pumpkin pie, where it can be combined with brown sugar and pecans to make a sweet and crunchy topping for the creamy pumpkin pie filling. It can also be used as a flavoring in sauces for savory dishes like grit cakes with country ham served with bourbon mayonnaise, Kentucky bourbon chili, and grilled flank steak.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44682", "revid": "50461682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44682", "title": "CMYK color model", "text": "Subtractive color model, used in color printing\nThe CMYK color model (also known as process color, or four color) is a subtractive color model, based on the CMY color model, used in color printing, and is also used to describe the printing process itself. The abbreviation \"CMYK\" refers to the four ink plates used: cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (most often black).\nThe CMYK model works by partially or entirely masking colors on a lighter, usually white, background. The ink reduces the light that would otherwise be reflected. Such a model is called \"subtractive\", as inks \"subtract\" some colors from white light; in the CMY model, white light minus red leaves cyan, white light minus green leaves magenta, and white light minus blue leaves yellow.\nIn additive color models, such as RGB, white is the \"additive\" combination of all primary colored lights, and black is the absence of light. In the CMYK model, it is the opposite: white is the natural color of the paper or other background, and black results from a full combination of colored inks. To save cost on ink, and to produce deeper black tones, unsaturated and dark colors are produced by using black ink instead of or in addition to combinations of cyan, magenta, and yellow.\nThe CMYK printing process was invented in the 1890s, when newspapers began to publish color comic strips.\nHalftoning.\nWith CMYK printing, \"halftoning\" (also called \"screening\") allows for less than full saturation of the primary colors; tiny dots of each primary color are printed in a pattern small enough that humans perceive a solid color. Magenta printed with a 20% halftone, for example, produces a pink color, because the eye perceives the tiny magenta dots on the large white paper as lighter and less saturated than the color of pure magenta ink. Halftoning allows for a continuous variability of each color, which enables continuous color mixing of the primaries. Without halftoning, each primary would be binary, i.e. on/off, which only allows for the reproduction of eight colors: white, the three primaries (cyan, magenta, yellow), the three secondaries (red, green, blue), and black.\nComparison to CMY.\nThe CMYK color model is based on the CMY color model, which omits the black ink. Four-color printing uses black ink in addition to subtractive primaries for several reasons:\nA black made with just CMY inks is sometimes called a \"composite black\".\nWhen a very dark area is wanted, a colored or gray CMY \"bedding\" is applied first, then a full black layer is applied on top, making a rich, deep black; this is called \"rich black\".\nThe amount of black to use to replace amounts of the other inks is variable, and the choice depends on the technology, paper and ink in use. Processes called \"under color removal\", \"under color addition\", and \"gray component replacement\" are used to decide on the final mix; different CMYK recipes will be used depending on the printing task.\nOther printer color models.\nCMYK, as well as all other process color printing, is contrasted with spot color printing, in which specific colored inks are used to generate the colors seen. Some printing presses are capable of printing with both four-color process inks and additional spot color inks at the same time. High-quality printed materials, such as marketing brochures and books, often include photographs requiring process-color printing, other graphic effects requiring spot colors (such as metallic inks), and finishes such as varnish, which enhances the glossy appearance of the printed piece.\nCMYK are the process printers which often have a relatively small color gamut. Processes such as Pantone's proprietary six-color (CMYKOG) Hexachrome considerably expand the gamut. Light, saturated colors often cannot be created with CMYK, and light colors in general may make visible the halftone pattern. Using a CcMmYK process, with the addition of light cyan and magenta inks to CMYK, can solve these problems, and such a process is used by many inkjet printers, including desktop models.\nComparison with RGB displays.\nComparisons between RGB displays and CMYK prints can be difficult, since the color reproduction technologies and properties are very different. A computer monitor mixes shades of red, green, and blue light to create color images. A CMYK printer instead uses light-absorbing cyan, magenta, and yellow inks, whose colors are mixed using dithering, halftoning, or some other optical technique.\nSimilar to electronic displays, the inks used in printing produce color gamuts that are only a subsets of the visible gamut, and the two color modes have their own specific ranges, each being capable of producing colors the other is not. As a result of this, an image rendered on an electronic display and rendered in print can vary in appearance. When designing images to be printed, designers work in RGB color spaces (electronic displays) capable of rendering colors a CMYK process cannot, and it is often difficult to accurately visualize a printed result that must fit into a different color space that both lacks some colors an electronic display can produce and includes colors it cannot.\nSpectrum of printed paper.\nTo reproduce color, the CMYK color model codes for absorbing light rather than emitting it (as is assumed by RGB). The \"K\" component ideally absorbs all wavelengths and is therefore achromatic. The cyan, magenta, and yellow components are used for color reproduction and they may be viewed as the inverse of RGB: Cyan absorbs red, magenta absorbs green, and yellow absorbs blue (\u2212R,\u2212G,\u2212B).\nConversion.\nSince RGB and CMYK spaces are both device-dependent spaces, there is no simple or general conversion formula that converts between them. Conversions are generally done through color management systems, using color profiles that describe the spaces being converted. An ICC profile defines the bidirectional conversion between a neutral \"profile connection\" color space (CIE XYZ or Lab) and a selected colorspace, in this case both RGB and CMYK. The precision of the conversion depends on the profile itself, the exact methodology, and because the gamuts do not generally match, the rendering intent and constraints such as ink limit.\nICC profiles, internally built out of lookup tables and other transformation functions, are capable of handling many effects of ink blending. One example is the dot gain, which show up as non-linear components in the color-to-density mapping. More complex interactions such as Neugebauer blending can be modelled in higher-dimension lookup tables.\nThe problem of computing a colorimetric estimate of the color that results from printing various combinations of ink has been addressed by many scientists. A general method that has emerged for the case of halftone printing is to treat each tiny overlap of color dots as one of 8 (combinations of CMY) or of 16 (combinations of CMYK) colors, which in this context are known as Neugebauer primaries. The resultant color would be an area-weighted colorimetric combination of these primary colors, except that the Yule\u2013Nielsen effect of scattered light between and within the areas complicates the physics and the analysis; empirical formulas for such analysis have been developed, in terms of detailed dye combination absorption spectra and empirical parameters.\nStandardization of printing practices allow for some profiles to be predefined. One of them is the US Specifications for Web Offset Publications, which has its ICC color profile built into some software including Microsoft Office (as Agfa RSWOP.icm).\nThe device-dependency of RGB and CMYK also means that a set of RGB or CMYK values cannot uniquely represent a color, so long as no device or paper\u2013ink\u2013process combination is specified. With RGB the sRGB standard is widespread enough to be the implied default, but there is not a single form of CMYK which is widespread enough to be the default.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The notion of \"almost everywhere\" is a companion notion to the concept of measure zero, and is analogous to the notion of \"almost surely\" in probability theory.\nMore specifically, a property holds almost everywhere if it holds for all elements in a set except a subset of measure zero, or equivalently, if the set of elements for which the property holds is conull. In cases where the measure is not complete, it is sufficient that the set be contained within a set of measure zero.

These are exactly the sets of full measure in a probability space.\nOccasionally, instead of saying that a property holds almost everywhere, it is said that the property holds for almost all elements (though the term almost all can also have other meanings).\nDefinition.\nIf formula_1 is a measure space, a property formula_2 is said to hold almost everywhere in formula_3 if there exists a measurable set formula_4 with formula_5, and all formula_6 have the property formula_2. \nAnother common way of expressing the same thing is to say that \"almost every point satisfies formula_8\", or that \"for almost every formula_9, formula_10 holds\".\nIt is \"not\" required that the set formula_11 has measure zero; it may not be measurable. \nBy the above definition, it is sufficient that formula_11 be contained in some set formula_13 that is measurable and has measure zero. \nHowever, this technicality vanishes when considering a complete measure space: if formula_14 is complete then formula_15 exists with measure zero if and only if formula_16 is measurable with measure zero.\nProperties.\nAs a consequence of the first two properties, it is often possible to reason about \"almost every point\" of a measure space as though it were an ordinary point rather than an abstraction. This is often done implicitly in informal mathematical arguments. However, one must be careful with this mode of reasoning because of the third bullet above: universal quantification over uncountable families of statements is valid for ordinary points but not for \"almost every point\".\nDefinition using ultrafilters.\nOutside of the context of real analysis, the notion of a property true almost everywhere is sometimes defined in terms of an ultrafilter. An ultrafilter on a set \"X\" is a maximal collection \"F\" of subsets of \"X\" such that:\nA property \"P\" of points in \"X\" holds almost everywhere, relative to an ultrafilter \"F\", if the set of points for which \"P\" holds is in \"F\".\nFor example, one construction of the hyperreal number system defines a hyperreal number as an equivalence class of sequences that are equal almost everywhere as defined by an ultrafilter.\nThe definition of \"almost everywhere\" in terms of ultrafilters is closely related to the definition in terms of measures, because each ultrafilter defines a finitely-additive measure taking only the values 0 and 1, where a set has measure 1 if and only if it is included in the ultrafilter."}

He is the first of the three Popes listed in the \"Annuario Pontificio\" with the title \"the Great\", alongside Popes Gregory I and Nicholas I.\nLeo was a Roman aristocrat. He is perhaps best known for meeting Attila the Hun in 452 and persuading him to turn back from his invasion of Italy, though how large a part his personal authority played is debated, and some argue that Attila was already ready to end his campaign. He is also a Doctor of the Church, most remembered theologically for issuing the Tome of Leo, a document which was a major foundation to the debates of the Council of Chalcedon, the fourth ecumenical council. That meeting dealt primarily with Christology and elucidated the definition of Christ's being as the hypostatic union of two natures, divine and human, united in one person, \"with neither confusion nor division\". It was followed by a major schism associated with Monophysitism, Miaphysitism and Dyophysitism. He also contributed significantly to developing ideas of papal authority.\nEarly life.\nAccording to the \"Liber Pontificalis\", he was a native of Tuscany and son of Quintianus or Quintilianus. By 431, as a deacon, he was sufficiently well known outside of Rome that John Cassian dedicated to him the treatise against Nestorius written at Leo's suggestion. About this time Cyril of Alexandria appealed to Rome regarding a jurisdictional dispute with Juvenal of Jerusalem, but it is not entirely clear whether the letter was intended for Leo in his capacity as archdeacon, or for Pope Celestine I directly.\nNear the end of the reign of Pope Sixtus III, Leo was dispatched at the request of Emperor Valentinian III to settle a dispute between A\u00ebtius, one of the chief Roman military commanders in Gaul, and the chief magistrate Albinus. Johann Peter Kirsch sees this commission as a proof of the confidence placed in the able deacon by the Imperial Court.\nPapacy.\nDuring Leo's absence in Gaul, Pope Sixtus III died on 11 August 440, and on 29 September Leo was unanimously elected by the people to succeed him. Soon after assuming the papal throne, Leo learned that in Aquileia, Pelagians were received into church communion without formal repudiation of their heresy; he censured this practice and directed that a provincial synod be held where such former Pelagians be required to make an unequivocal abjuration.\nLeo claimed that Manichaeans, possibly fleeing Vandal Africa, had come to Rome and secretly organized there. In late 443, Leo preached a series of sermons condemning the Manichaeans and calling for Romans to denounce suspected heretics to their priests. Eventually, suspected heretics were brought to court, and likely under torture, they confessed to various crimes. By early 444, Leo announced to the bishops of Italy that the Manichaeans had been eradicated from Rome. According to his contemporary Prosper of Aquitaine, Leo exposed the Manichaeans and burned their books. He was equally firm against the Priscillianist sect. Bishop Turibius of Astorga, astonished at the spread of the sect in Spain, had addressed the other Spanish bishops on the subject, sending a copy of his letter to Leo, who took the opportunity to write an extended treatise (21 July 447) against the sect, examining its false teaching in detail and calling for a Spanish general council to investigate whether it had any adherents in the episcopate.\nFrom a pastoral perspective, he energized charitable works in a Rome beset by famines, an influx of refugees, and poverty. He further associated the practice of fasting with charity and almsgiving, particularly on the occasion of the \"Quattuor tempora\", (the quarterly Ember days). It was during Leo's papacy that the term \"Pope\", which previously meant any bishop, came to exclusively mean the Bishop of Rome.\nPapal authority.\nLeo drew many learned men about him and chose Prosper of Aquitaine to act in some secretarial or notarial capacity. Leo was a significant contributor to the centralisation of spiritual authority within the Church and in reaffirming papal authority. In 450, the Byzantine Emperor Theodosius II, in a letter to Pope Leo I, was the first to call the Bishop of Rome the Patriarch of the West, a title that would continue to be used by the popes through the present days (only interrupted by a brief period between 2006 and 2024).\nBy 447, he declared that heretics deserved the most severe punishments. The Pope justified the death penalty declaring that if the followers of a heresy were allowed to live, that would be the end of human and Divine law.\nVarious regional matters.\nOn several occasions, Leo was asked to arbitrate disputes in Gaul. Patroclus of Arles (d. 426) had received from Pope Zosimus the recognition of a subordinate primacy over the Gallican Church, which was strongly asserted by his successor Hilary of Arles. An appeal from Chelidonius of Besan\u00e7on gave Leo the opportunity to assert the pope's authority over Hilary, who defended himself stoutly at Rome, refusing to recognize Leo's judicial status. Feeling that the primatial rights of the bishop of Rome were threatened, Leo appealed to the civil power for support and obtained, from Valentinian III, a decree of 6 June 445, which recognized the primacy of the bishop of Rome based on the merits of Peter, the dignity of the city, and the legislation of the First Council of Nicaea; and provided for the forcible extradition by provincial governors of any bishop who refused to answer a summons to Rome. Faced with this decree, Hilary submitted to the pope, although under his successor, Ravennius, Leo divided the metropolitan rights between Arles and Vienne (450).\nIn 445, Leo disputed with Patriarch Dioscorus, Cyril of Alexandria's successor as Patriarch of Alexandria, insisting that the ecclesiastical practice of his see should follow that of Rome on the basis that Mark the Evangelist, the disciple of Peter the Apostle and the founder of the Alexandrian Church, could have had no other tradition than that of the prince of the apostles.\nThe fact that the African province of Mauretania Caesariensis had been preserved to the empire and thus to the Nicene faith during the Vandal invasion and, in its isolation, was disposed to rest on outside support, gave Leo an opportunity to assert his authority there. In 446 he wrote to the Church in Mauretania in regard to a number of questions of discipline, stressing the point that laymen were not to be appointed to the episcopate.\nIn a letter to the bishops of Campania, Picenum, and Tuscany (443) he required the observance of all his precepts and those of his predecessors; and he sharply rebuked the bishops of Sicily (447) for their deviation from the Roman custom as to the time of baptism, requiring them to send delegates to the Roman synod to learn the proper practice.\nBecause of the earlier line of division between the western and eastern parts of the Roman Empire, Illyria was ecclesiastically subject to Rome. Pope Innocent I had constituted the metropolitan of Thessalonica his vicar, in order to oppose the growing influence of the patriarch of Constantinople in the area. In a letter of about 446 to a successor bishop of Thessalonica, Anastasius, Leo reproached him for the way he had treated one of the metropolitan bishops subject to him; after giving various instructions about the functions entrusted to Anastasius and stressing that certain powers were reserved to the pope himself, Leo wrote: \"The care of the universal Church should converge towards Peter's one seat, and nothing anywhere should be separated from its Head.\"\nHe succeeded in having an imperial patriarch, Timothy Salophakiolos, and not Timotheus Aelurus, chosen as Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria on the murder of Greek Patriarch Proterius of Alexandria.\nWritings.\nAlmost 100 sermons and 150 letters of Leo I have been preserved.\n\"Tome\".\nAt the Second Council of Ephesus in 449, Leo's representatives delivered his famous \"Tome\", a statement of the faith of the Roman Church in the form of a letter addressed to Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople, which repeats, in close adherence to Augustine of Hippo, the formulas of western Christology. The council did not read the letter nor did it pay any attention to the protests of Leo's legates but deposed Flavian and Eusebius of Dorylaeum, who appealed to Rome. That is one reason that the council was never recognized as ecumenical and was later repudiated by the Council of Chalcedon.\nIt was presented again at the subsequent Council of Chalcedon as offering a solution to the Christological controversies still raging between East and West.\nCouncil of Chalcedon.\nEutyches, in the beginning of the conflict, appealed to Leo and took refuge with him on his condemnation by Flavian, but on receiving full information from Flavian, Leo took his side decisively. Leo demanded of the emperor that an ecumenical council should be held in Italy, and in the meantime, at a Roman synod in October 449 (Source needed), repudiated all the decisions of the \"Robber Synod\". In his letters to the emperor and others he demanded the deposition of Eutyches as a Manichaean and Docetic heretic.\nThe Council of Chalcedon of 451 rejected the heresy of Eutyches who denied the true human nature of the Son of God, and affirmed the union in his one Person, without confusion and without separation, of his two natures, human and divine.\nThe acts of the council report: \"After the reading of the foregoing epistle, the most reverend bishops cried out: This is the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the Apostles. So we all believe, thus the orthodox believe. Anathema to him who does not thus believe. Peter has spoken thus through Leo. So taught the Apostles. Piously and truly did Leo teach, so taught Cyril. Everlasting be the memory of Cyril. Leo and Cyril taught the same thing, anathema to him who does not so believe. This is the true faith. Those of us who are orthodox thus believe. This is the faith of the fathers. Why were not these things read at Ephesus? These are the things Dioscorus hid away.\"\nLeo firmly declined to confirm their disciplinary arrangements, which seemed to allow Constantinople a practically equal authority with Rome and regarded the civil importance of a city as a determining factor in its ecclesiastical position; but he strongly supported its dogmatic decrees, especially when, after the accession of Emperor Leo I (457), there seemed to be a disposition toward compromise with the Eutychians.\nTeaching on Christ.\nLeo's writings (sermons and letters) mostly discuss theological questions concerning the person of Jesus Christ\n(Christology) and his role as mediator and savior (Soteriology), which is partially connected to the Council of Chalcedon, in which Roman legates represented Leo. Subsequently, through numerous letters to bishops and members of the imperial family, Leo incessantly worked for the propagation and universal reception of the faith in Christ as defined by Chalcedon, also in the eastern part of the Roman empire. Leo defends both the true divinity and true humanity of Christ against heretical one-sidedness. He takes up this topic also in many of his sermons, and over the years, he further develops his own original concepts. A central idea around which Leo deepens and explains his theology is Christ's presence in the Church, more specifically in the teaching and preaching of the faith (Scripture, Tradition and their interpretation), in the liturgy (sacraments and celebrations), in the life of the individual believer and of the organized Church, especially in a council.\nTo Leo the Great, Mariology is determined by Christology. If Christ were divine only, everything about him would be divine. Only his divinity would have been crucified, buried and resurrected. Mary would only be the mother of God, and Christians would have no hope for their own resurrection. The nucleus of Christianity would be destroyed. The most unusual beginning of a truly human life through her was to give birth to Jesus, the Lord and Son of King David.\nOriental Orthodox view.\nLeo's Christological formula however was not entirely well received. Following the death of Dioscorus, the See of Alexandria split into two rival patriarchates; opposing and supporting Chalcedon respectively. The former of which, led by Timothy II of Alexandria would condemn both the heresy of Eutyches as well as the Council of Chalcedon and the Tome of Leo at the Third Council of Ephesus. The communion that accepted Ephesus III is known today as the Oriental Orthodox Church.\nEphesus III accused Leo's formula of two natures after the union as being fundamentally no different to the view of Nestorius, contradicting Cyril of Alexandria's formula of \"mia physis tou Theo logou sesark\u014dmen\u0113\", or \"one (mia) nature of the Word of God incarnate\" (\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7).\nSeveral Oriental Orthodox Church historians, such as Pakhoum A. El-Moharraky and Waheeb Atalla Girgis have viewed the council as a dispute with the Church of Rome over precedence among the various patriarchal sees. Coptic sources, both in Coptic and in Arabic, suggest that questions of political and ecclesiastical authority exaggerated differences between the two professions of faith. The Coptic Orthodox Christians are Miaphysites, which means they believe that Jesus Christ is both 100% human and 100% divine but in one person without mingling, confusion or alteration. In every liturgy till this day, the Copts recite \u201cChrist's divinity parted not from His humanity, not for a single moment nor a twinkling of an eye\".\nHeir of Peter.\nLeo assumed the papacy at a time of increasing barbarian invasions; this, coupled with the decreasing imperial authority in the West, forced the Bishop of Rome to take a more active part in civil and political affairs. He was one of the first bishops of Rome to promote papal primacy based on succession from Peter the Apostle; and he did so as a means of maintaining unity among the churches.\nBesides recourse to biblical language, Leo also described his own special relationship with Peter in terms derived from Roman law. He called himself the (unworthy) heir and deputy (\"vicarius\") of Peter, having received his apostolic authority and being obliged to follow his example. On the one hand, Peter stood before him with a claim on how Leo was to exercise his office; on the other hand, Leo, as the Roman bishop, represented the Apostle, whose authority he held. Christ, however, always comes out as the source of all grace and authority, and Leo is responsible to him for how he fulfilled his duties (sermon 1). Thus, the office of the Roman bishop was grounded on the special relationship between Christ and Peter, a relationship that cannot be repeated per se; therefore, Leo depended on Peter's mediation, his assistance and his example in order to be able to adequately fulfill his role and exercise his authority as the Bishop of Rome, both in the city and beyond.\nLeo and Attila.\nAfter the indecisive outcome of the Battle of Chalons in 451, Attila invaded Italy in 452, sacking cities such as Aquileia and heading for Rome. He allegedly demanded that the sister of the reigning Emperor Valentinian III be sent to him with a dowry. In response, the emperor sent three envoys to negotiate with Attila: Gennadius Avienus, one of the consuls of 450, Memmius Aemilius Trygetius, the former urban prefect, and Leo. Little is known of the specifics of the negotiations, as a result of which Attila withdrew. Most ancient and medieval historians celebrated Leo's actions, giving him all the credit for this successful embassy. According to Prosper of Aquitaine, who was alive at the time of the event, Attila was so impressed by Leo that he withdrew. Another near-contemporary was the historian Priscus who records that Attila was dissuaded from attacking Rome by his own men because they feared he would share the fate of the Visigothic king Alaric, who died shortly after sacking the city in 410. Paul the Deacon, in the late 8th century, relates that an enormously huge man dressed in priestly robes and armed with a sword, visible only to Attila, threatened him and his army with death during his discourse with Leo, and this prompted Attila to submit to his request.\nWriting in the early 20th century, the religious skeptic John B. Bury remarked: \nThe fact of the embassy cannot be doubted. The distinguished ambassadors visited the Hun's camp near the south shore of Lake Garda. It is also certain that Attila suddenly retreated. But we are at a loss to know what considerations were offered him to induce him to depart. It is unreasonable to suppose that this heathen king would have cared for the thunders or persuasions of the Church. The Emperor refused to surrender Honoria, and it is not recorded that money was paid. A trustworthy chronicle hands down another account which does not conflict with the fact that an embassy was sent, but evidently furnishes the true reasons which moved Attila to receive it favourably. Plague broke out in the barbarian host and their food ran short, and at the same time troops arrived from the east, sent by Marcian to the aid of Italy. If his host was suffering from pestilence, and if troops arrived from the east, we can understand that Attila was forced to withdraw. But whatever terms were arranged, he did not pretend that they meant a permanent peace. The question of Honoria was left unsettled, and he threatened that he would come again and do worse things in Italy unless she were given up with the due portion of the Imperial possessions.\nLeo's intercession could not prevent the sack of the city by the Vandal King Genseric in 455, but murder and arson were repressed by his influence. The Pope and members of his clergy, went to meet the invader to implore him to desist. While the Vandals plundered the city, the gesture nevertheless prevented Rome from being burned and assured that the Basilicas of St Peter, St Paul and St John, in which part of the terrified population sought refuge, were spared. Leo assisted in rebuilding the city of Rome, restoring key places such as Saint Peter's.\nOn the fundamental dignity of Christians.\nIn his \"In Nativitate Domini\", Christmas Day, sermon, \"Christian, remember your dignity\", Leo articulates a fundamental dignity common to all Christians, whether saints or sinners, and the consequent obligation to live up to it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Our Saviour, dearly-beloved, was born today: let us be glad. For there is no proper place for sadness, when we keep the birthday of the Life, which destroys the fear of mortality and brings to us the joy of promised eternity. No one is kept from sharing in this happiness. There is for all one common measure of joy, because as our Lord the destroyer of sin and death finds none free from charge, so is He come to free us all. Let the saint exult in that he draws near to victory. Let the sinner be glad in that he is invited to pardon. Let the gentile take courage in that he is called to life...&lt;br&gt;\nLet us put off then the old man with his deeds: and having obtained a share in the birth of Christ let us renounce the works of the flesh. Christian, acknowledge thy dignity, and becoming a partner in the Divine nature, refuse to return to the old baseness by degenerate conduct. Remember the Head and the Body of which thou art a member. Recollect that thou wert rescued from the power of darkness and brought out into God\u2019s light and kingdom. By the mystery of Baptism thou wert made the temple of the Holy Ghost: do not put such a denizen to flight from thee by base acts, and subject thyself once more to the devil\u2019s thraldom: because thy purchase money is the blood of Christ, because He shall judge thee in truth Who ransomed thee in mercy, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit reigns for ever and ever. Amen.\nDeath and burial.\nLeo died on 10 November 461 and, as he wished to be buried as close as possible to the tomb of St. Peter, his body was entombed within the portico of Old St. Peter's Basilica. He was the first pope to be buried within St. Peter's.11 In 688, Pope Sergius I had Leo's remains moved to the south transept, inside the basilica. The relocation was apparently due to the number of later papal burials obscuring the prominence that Sergius believed Leo's tomb should have.40\nSignificance.\nPope Benedict XVI said that Leo's papacy was \"undoubtedly one of the most important in the Church's history\".\nIn 1754 Pope Benedict XIV proclaimed Leo I as a Doctor of the Church. Next to Leo only one other pope, Gregory I, is also recognized as Doctor of the Church.\nThe Catholic Church marks 10 November as the feast day of Saint Leo, given in the \"Martyrologium Hieronymianum\" and the 8th-century Calendar of Saint Willibrord as the date of his death and entry to heaven. His feast was once celebrated in Rome on 28 June, the anniversary of the placing of his relics in Saint Peter's Basilica, but in the 12th century, the Gallican Rite feast of 11 April was admitted to the General Roman Calendar, which maintained that date until 1969.\nThe Eastern Catholic Churches as well as the Eastern Orthodox Church celebrate Saint Leo on 18 February.\nLeo the Great is honored in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 10 November.\nIn the Roman rite, fragments of his texts are read in the liturgy of hours, for example on Christmas.\nSince his reign, a total of 13 Popes have borne Pope Leo's name. The latest is the current Pope Leo XIV.\nHymns.\nTroparion (Tone 3)\nYou were the Church's instrument\nin strengthening the teaching of true doctrine;\nyou shone forth from the West like a sun dispelling the errors of the heretics.\nRighteous Leo, entreat Christ God to grant us His great mercy.\nTroparion (Tone 8)\nO Champion of Orthodoxy, and teacher of holiness,\nThe enlightenment of the universe and the inspired glory of true believers.\nO most wise Father Leo, your teachings are as music of the Holy Spirit for us!\nPray that Christ our God may save our souls!\nKontakion (Tone 3)\nSeated upon the throne of the priesthood, glorious Leo,\nyou shut the mouths of the spiritual lions.\nWith divinely inspired teachings of the honored Trinity,\nyou shed the light of the knowledge of God up-on your flock.\nTherefore, you are glorified as a divine initiate of the grace of God.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Classified as a \"pre-Code\" production, the film was released just four months before the MPPDA began rigidly enforcing the Hays Code in July 1934.\nIt is seen as one of the greatest films ever made and was the first of only three films (along with \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and \"The Silence of the Lambs\") to win all five major Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Adapted Screenplay.\nIn 1993, it was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In 2013, the film underwent an extensive restoration by Sony Pictures. The film's copyright was renewed in 1962, and under current United States law it will enter the public domain on January 1, 2030.\nPlot.\nWall Street heiress Ellie Andrews has eloped with glamorous pilot King Westley. Her father Alexander senses that Westley married Ellie for her money. Mr. Andrews sequesters Ellie on his Florida yacht while his lawyers arrange an annulment. However, Ellie breaks out and swims to shore, where she boards a Greyhound bus bound for New York City to reunite with Westley. Mr. Andrews makes headlines by putting out a $10,000 reward () for her safe return.\nOn the bus, Ellie meets Peter Warne, a newly unemployed newspaper reporter. Peter is annoyed by Ellie, who expects special treatment and lacks practical life skills. However, he is drawn to Ellie's strong personality and helps her after a thief steals most of her money. During a scheduled stop in Jacksonville, Ellie misses the bus, having assumed that the driver would wait for her. Peter reads the headlines about Ellie's escape and stays behind to accompany her. He gives her a choice: if she gives him an exclusive on her story, he will help her get back to New York. If not, he will tell her father where she is. Ellie agrees.\nBecause there are no more buses that day, Peter and Ellie rent a motel room together. Peter strings up a makeshift room divider between their respective beds, which he jokingly calls the \"walls of Jericho\". In the morning, Mr. Andrews' private detectives question Peter and Ellie. They evade the detectives by pretending to be a married couple having a stormy argument.\nWhen the next bus ditches into a swamp, Peter and Ellie try hitchhiking. They argue about Ellie's privilege and Peter's cockiness, but begin to fall in love. Peter tries and fails to hail a series of cars, while Ellie succeeds on her first attempt by displaying a leg. However, the driver Ellie hails is a highwayman who drives away with their luggage. Peter chases him down and steals his car, allowing them to continue their journey.\nAt a motel in New Jersey, Ellie confesses her love to Peter, who is moved, but rebuffs her advances because he considers himself unworthy of Ellie as long as he remains unemployed. In the early morning, he drives to New York to sell his story to his old newspaper for $1,000. Because he leaves without Ellie, the motel concludes that Ellie is a loose woman and evicts her. Ellie believes that Peter has deserted her and calls her father to drive her home. On her way back, she passes by Peter, who realizes he is too late.\nMr. Andrews reluctantly arranges a second, formal wedding with Westley, but shortly before the ceremony, Ellie confesses to her father that she is in love with Peter. She resolves to marry Westley anyway after Peter reaches out to Mr. Andrews about a \"financial\" matter, which she assumes is the $10,000 reward. In reality, Peter just wants Mr. Andrews to reimburse him for his expenses from the trip, which come out to $39.60. Mr. Andrews is impressed by Peter's honesty and asks him whether he loves Ellie; after dodging the question several times, Peter admits that he loves her.\nWhile walking Ellie down the aisle, Mr. Andrews reveals Peter's full story. He expresses his approval of Peter and says that if Ellie changes her mind, he will help her escape the wedding and pay Westley to go away. At the last minute, Ellie dumps Westley at the altar.\nAs Mr. Andrews predicted, Westley agrees to give up Ellie for $100,000. Peter, who is anxiously waiting for the annulment to go through before he can sleep with Ellie, telegrams Mr. Andrews that \"the walls of Jericho are toppling\". Mr. Andrews confirms that Peter can \"let 'em topple\". At the honeymooners' motor court, the owners hear a trumpet play and a blanket fall to the floor in the couple's cabin, after which the lights go out.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Ernie Adams as the bag thief\nProduction.\nCasting.\nNeither Gable nor Colbert was the first choice to play the lead roles. Miriam Hopkins rejected the part of Ellie. Robert Montgomery and Myrna Loy were then offered the roles, but both turned down the script. Loy later noted that the final story as filmed bore little resemblance to the script that she and Montgomery had been given. Margaret Sullavan also rejected the part. Constance Bennett was willing to accept the role if she could produce the film herself but Columbia Pictures would not agree to that condition. Bette Davis then wanted the role but she was under contract with Warner Brothers and Jack L. Warner refused to lend her. Carole Lombard was unable to accept because Columbia's proposed filming schedule would conflict with her work on \"Bolero\" at Paramount. Loretta Young also turned it down.\nHarry Cohn suggested Colbert, who initially turned down the role. Her first film, \"For the Love of Mike\" (1927), had been directed by Capra and was such a disaster that neither wanted to work with the other again. Later, she agreed to the role only if her salary was doubled to $50,000 and if her scenes were completed in four weeks so that she could take a planned vacation.\nAccording to Hollywood legend, Gable was lent to Columbia Pictures, then considered a minor studio, as punishment for refusing a role at his own studio. That tale has been partially refuted by more recent biographies. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer did not have a project ready for Gable and the studio was paying him his contracted salary of $2,000 per week whether he worked or not. Louis B. Mayer lent him to Columbia for $2,500 per week, hence netting MGM $500 per week while he was gone. Capra, however, insisted that Gable was a reluctant participant in the film.\nFilming.\nFilming began in a tense atmosphere as Gable and Colbert were dissatisfied with the quality of the script. Capra understood their dissatisfaction and let screenwriter Robert Riskin rewrite it. Colbert continued to show her displeasure on the set. She also initially balked at pulling up her skirt to entice a passing driver to provide a ride, complaining that it was unladylike. Upon seeing the chorus girl who was brought in as her body double, an outraged Colbert told the director, \"Get her out of here. I'll do it. That's not my leg!\" Capra claimed that Colbert \"had many little tantrums, motivated by her antipathy toward me,\" but \"was wonderful in the part.\" Part of the film was made on Thousand Oaks Boulevard in Thousand Oaks, California.\nReception.\nAfter filming was done, Colbert complained to a friend that she had \"just finished the worst picture in the world.\" Columbia appeared to have low expectations for the film and did not mount much of an advertising campaign for it.\nThe film premiered at Radio City Music Hall. Initial reviews were generally positive. Mordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" called it \"a good piece of fiction, which, with all its feverish stunts, is blessed with bright dialogue and a good quota of relatively restrained scenes\". Hall described Colbert's performance as \"engaging and lively\" and Gable as \"excellent\". \"Variety\" reported that it was \"without a particularly strong plot\" but \"manages to come through in a big way, due to the acting, dialog, situations and directing\". \"Film Daily\" praised it as \"a lively yarn, fast-moving, plenty humorous, racy enough to be tantalizing, and yet perfectly decorous\". The \"New York Herald Tribune\" called it \"lively and amusing\".\nJohn Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" panned it as \"pretty much nonsense and quite dreary\", which was probably the review Capra had in mind when he recalled in his autobiography that \"sophisticated\" critics had dismissed the film. Despite the positive reviews, the film was only moderately successful in its initial run. After it was released to secondary movie houses, ticket sales became brisk, especially in smaller towns where the film's characters and simple romance struck a chord with moviegoers who were not surrounded by luxury. It turned out to be a major box office smash, easily Columbia's biggest hit until the late 1980s. During its initial release, the film earned $1 million in theater rentals from the United States and Canada.\nRotten Tomatoes compiled 108 reviews of the film to form a 98% score and an average rating of 9.1/10. The consensus reads, \"Capturing its stars and director at their finest, \"It Happened One Night\" remains unsurpassed by the countless romantic comedies it has inspired\". The film holds a score of 87 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 16 critics.\nColbert was nominated for an Academy Award, but decided not to attend the ceremony since she felt she would not win and planned to take a cross-country railroad trip. After she was named the winner, studio chief Harry Cohn sent someone to \"drag her off\" the train, which had not yet departed, to bring her to the ceremony. Colbert arrived wearing a two-piece traveling suit which she had had the Paramount Pictures costume designer, Travis Banton, make for her trip.\nAcademy Awards.\nThe film won all five of the Academy Awards for which it was nominated at the 7th Academy Awards for 1934:\n\"It Happened One Night\" was the first film to win the \"Big Five\" Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Writing). As of 2025[ [update]], only two films have matched this feat: \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" in 1975 and \"The Silence of the Lambs\" in 1991.\nOn December 15, 1996, Gable's Oscar was auctioned off for $607,500 to Steven Spielberg, who donated the statuette to the Motion Picture Academy. In June of the following year, Colbert's Oscar was offered for auction by Christie's but attracted no bids.\nOthers.\nThe film was included in the following American Film Institute lists:\nInfluence.\n\"It Happened One Night\" made an immediate impact on the public. In one scene, Gable undresses for bed, taking off his shirt to reveal that he is bare-chested. An urban legend claims that, as a result, sales of men's undershirts declined noticeably. The movie also prominently features a Greyhound bus in the story, spurring interest in bus travel nationwide.\nThe unpublished memoirs of animator Friz Freleng mention that this was one of his favorite films. \"It Happened One Night\" has a few parallels with, and may have even inspired certain characteristics of, the cartoon character Bugs Bunny, who made his first appearance six years later, and who Freleng helped develop. In the film, a minor character, Oscar Shapely, continually calls the Gable character \"Doc,\" an imaginary character named \"Bugs Dooley\" is mentioned once in order to frighten Shapely, and there is also a scene in which Gable eats carrots while talking quickly with his mouth full, as Bugs does.\nRestoration.\nIn 2013 \"It Happened One Night\" was digitally restored. A new wet-gate master was produced by Sony Colorworks for scanning at 4K. The images were digitally treated at Prasad Corporation to remove dirt, tears, scratches, and other artifacts. Care was taken to preserve the original look of the film.\nRemakes and adaptations.\nThe film has inspired a number of remakes, including the musicals \"Eve Knew Her Apples\" (1945) starring Ann Miller and \"You Can't Run Away from It\" (1956) starring June Allyson and Jack Lemmon, which was directed and produced by Dick Powell.\n\"It Happened One Night\" was adapted as a one-hour radio play on the March 20, 1939 broadcast of \"Lux Radio Theatre\", with Colbert and Gable reprising their roles. The screenplay was also adapted as a radio play for the January 28, 1940, broadcast of \"The Campbell Playhouse\", starring Orson Welles (Mr. Andrews), William Powell (Peter Warne) and Miriam Hopkins (Ellie Andrews).\n\"It Happened One Night\" has been adapted into numerous Indian films. These include four Hindi adaptations: \"Nadaan\" (1951), \"Chori Chori\" (1956), \"Nau Do Gyarah\" (1957) and \"Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahin\" (1991), one Bengali adaptation \"Chaoa Paoa\" (1959), two Tamil adaptations: \"Chandrodayam\" (1966) and \"Kadhal Rojavae\" (2000), and one Kannada adaptation \"Hudugaata\" (2007).\nIn popular culture.\nThe 1937 Laurel and Hardy comedy \"Way Out West\" parodied the famous hitchhiking scene with Stan Laurel managing to stop a stage coach using the same technique. \"A Life Less Ordinary\" (1997) by Danny Boyle has a plot that shares similarities with \"It Happened One Night\" and clearly references the movie in its own hitchhiking scene.\nMel Brooks's film \"Spaceballs\" (1987) parodies the wedding scene. As she walks down the aisle to wed Prince Valium, Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga) is told by King Roland (Dick Van Patten) that Lone Starr (Bill Pullman) forsook the reward for the princess's return and only asked to be reimbursed for the cost of the trip.\nOther films have used familiar plot points from \"It Happened One Night\". In \"Bandits\" (2001), Joe Blake (Bruce Willis) erects a blanket partition between motel room beds out of respect for Kate Wheeler's (Cate Blanchett's) privacy. He remarks that he saw people do the same thing in an old movie. In \"Sex and the City 2\", Carrie and Mr. Big watch the film (specifically the hitchhiking scene) in a hotel; later in the film Carrie uses the idea which she got from the film to get a taxi in the Middle East.\nIn \"The Bogman of Letchmoor Heath\", the second episode of the horror/comedy television series \"She-Wolf of London\" (1990\u20131991), lead characters Randi Wallace (Kate Hodge) and Ian Matheson (Neil Dickson) rent a motel room, and, uncomfortable with the lack of privacy afforded, Ian stretches a bed sheet like a curtain between the two beds. Ian makes reference to \"It Happened One Night\" but Randi is unfamiliar with the film, remarking that she would rather \"read a book\".\nBeginning in January 2014, the comic \"9 Chickweed Lane\" tied a story arc to \"It Happened One Night\" when one of the characters, Lt. William O'Malley, is injured during World War II and believes himself to be Peter Warne. As he sneaks through German-occupied France, several plot points run parallel to that of \"It Happened One Night\" and he believes his French contact to be Ellen Andrews.\n\"It Happened One Night\" has been cited as an influence on several other films. Films that have been compared to the picture for their similar premises include \"Love on the Run\" (1936), \"The Bride Came C.O.D.\" (1941), \"A Lady Takes a Chance\" (1943), \"Roman Holiday\" (1953), \"The Sure Thing\" (1985), \"Spaceballs\" (1987), \"Runaway Bride\" (1999), \"Forces of Nature\" (1999), and \"Leap Year\" (2010).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nStreaming audio"}
{"id": "44698", "revid": "10643005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44698", "title": "Zinoviev letter", "text": "Forged document by the Daily Mail\nThe Zinoviev letter was a forged document published and sensationalised by the \"Daily Mail\" newspaper four days before the 1924 United Kingdom general election, which was held on 29 October. The letter purported to be a directive from Grigory Zinoviev, the head of the Communist International (Comintern) in Moscow, to the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), ordering it to engage in seditious activities. It stated that the normalisation of British\u2013Soviet relations under a Labour Party government would radicalise the British working class and put the CPGB in a favourable position to pursue a Bolshevik-style revolution. It further suggested that these effects would extend throughout the British Empire. The right-wing press depicted the letter as a grave foreign subversion of British politics and blamed the incumbent Labour government under Ramsay MacDonald for promoting the policy of political reconciliation and open trade with the Soviet Union on which the scheme appeared to depend. The election resulted in the fall of the first Labour government and a strong victory for the Conservative Party and the continued collapse of the Liberal Party. Labour supporters often blamed the letter, at least in part, for their party's defeat.\nThe letter was widely taken to be authentic upon publication and for some time afterwards, but historians now agree it was a forgery. The letter perhaps aided the Conservative Party by hastening the ongoing collapse of the Liberal Party vote, which, in turn, produced a Conservative landslide. A. J. P. Taylor argued that the letter's most important impact was on the mindset of Labourites, who for years afterwards blamed foul play for their defeat, thereby misunderstanding the political forces at work and postponing what Taylor regarded as necessary reforms in the Labour Party.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nOn 22 January 1924, the Labour Party formed a government in the United Kingdom for the first time. However, it was a minority government and therefore liable to fall if the Conservatives and Liberals combined against it. In foreign policy, the government used its executive powers to offer official recognition of the Soviet Union in February 1924. It also proposed to lend it money and to open up trade, but parliament mostly obstructed these measures. On 8 October 1924, the Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald suffered defeat in the House of Commons on a motion of no confidence forwarded by the Liberals, who had until then supported the continuation of the minority government while also blocking most of its signature policy initiatives. Instead of resigning, MacDonald obtained permission from King George V for a dissolution of Parliament and the holding of a new election. The immediate cause of the parliamentary defeat had been the government's decision to drop the prosecution of communist editor John Ross Campbell under the Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797, for publication of an open letter in \"Workers' Weekly\" calling on soldiers to \"let it be known that, neither in the class war nor in a military war, will you turn your guns on your fellow workers, but instead will line up with your fellow workers in an attack upon the exploiters and capitalists, and will use your arms on the side of your own class.\" A general election was scheduled for 29 October.\nLetter.\nNear the end of the short election campaign, there appeared in the \"Daily Mail\" newspaper the text of a letter addressed to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) purporting to have originated from Grigory Zinoviev, head of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (Comintern); Secretary of the Comintern Otto Wille Kuusinen; and Arthur MacManus, a British representative at a conference of the Executive Committee. It predicted that the Labour government's attempted normalisation of Britain's diplomatic and economic relations with the Soviet Union would not only profit the latter but also stir the British proletariat to revolutionary action and allow Soviet influence throughout the British Empire to widen.\nOne particularly damaging section of this letter read:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPublication.\nThe document was published in the conservative \"Daily Mail\" newspaper four days before the election and then picked up by other right-wing newspapers. The letter rankled at a sensitive time in relations between Britain and the Soviet Union, owing to vehement Conservative opposition to the parliamentary ratification of the Anglo-Soviet trade agreement of 8 August.\nThe publication of the letter was severely embarrassing to Prime Minister MacDonald and his Labour Party. Although his party faced a high likelihood of losing office, MacDonald had not given up hope in the campaign. Following the letter's publication, any chance of an upset victory was dashed, as the spectre of internal unrest and a government oblivious to, or even complicit in, the alleged peril thereof dominated the headlines and public discourse. MacDonald's attempts to cast doubt on the authenticity of the letter were in vain, hampered by the document's widespread acceptance among government officials. He told his Cabinet that he \"felt like a man sewn in a sack and thrown into the sea.\".\nElection result.\nThe Conservatives decisively won the October 1924 election, ending the country's first Labour government. After the Conservatives formed a government with Stanley Baldwin as Prime Minister, a Cabinet committee investigated the letter and concluded that it was genuine. The Conservative government did not undertake any further investigation, despite continuing suggestions that the letter was forged. On 21 November 1924, the government cancelled the unratified trade agreement with the Soviet Union. At about this juncture, MI5 determined secretly that the letter was beyond question a forgery. In order to protect its reputation and to keep the myth of Labour's acquiescence to the Soviet Union alive, it did not inform the rest of the government, which continued to treat it as genuine.\nThe Conservatives gained 155 seats, for a total of 413 seats. Labour lost 40 seats, retaining 151. The Liberals lost 118 seats, were left with only 40, and lost over a million votes.\nDenial by Zinoviev.\nThe Comintern and the Soviet government strongly and consistently denied the authenticity of the document. Grigory Zinoviev issued a denial on 27 October 1924 (two days before the election), which was finally published in English in the December 1924 issue of \"The Communist Review\", the monthly theoretical magazine of the CPGB, well after the MacDonald government had already fallen. Zinoviev declared:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The letter of 15th September, 1924, which has been attributed to me, is from the first to the last word, a forgery. Let us take the heading. The organisation of which I am the president never describes itself officially as the \"Executive Committee of the Third Communist International\"; the official name is \"Executive Committee of the Communist International.\" Equally incorrect is the signature, \"The Chairman of the Presidium.\" The forger has shown himself to be very stupid in his choice of the date. On the 15th of September, 1924, I was taking a holiday in Kislovodsk, and, therefore, could not have signed any official letter. [...]\nIt is not difficult to understand why some of the leaders of the Liberal-Conservative bloc had recourse to such methods as the forging of documents. Apparently they seriously thought they would be able, at the last minute before the elections, to create confusion in the ranks of those electors who sincerely sympathise with the Treaty between England and the Soviet Union. It is much more difficult to understand why the English Foreign Office, which is still under the control of the Prime Minister, MacDonald, did not refrain from making use of such a white-guardist forgery.\nImpact.\nMost historians now agree that the letter had little immediate impact on the Labour vote, which not only held up but, in fact, increased slightly in terms of its share of the popular vote (although the main reason for this uptick was that the party fielded candidates in 87 more constituencies than it had in the previous election). Still, the letter helped to propel the Conservatives to a large parliamentary majority by allowing them to poach voters frightened by the First Red Scare from the withering Liberal bloc. The Conservative politician Robert Rhodes James claimed that the letter provided Labour \"with a magnificent excuse for failure and defeat. The inadequacies that had been exposed in the Government in its brief existence could be ignored\". Indeed, many Labourites for years blamed the letter, at least in part, for the defeat of the party. Commentators such as Taylor believed that the party's subsequent failure to address demonstrated policy inadequacies, such as unemployment and relations with the trade unions, was because the letter was blamed for the defeat, and not the political programme.\nThe real significance of the election was that the Liberal Party, whom Labour had displaced as the second-largest political party in 1922, became once again a minor party, its no-confidence gambit having completely backfired.\nA 1967 British study concluded the Labour Party was destined for defeat in October 1924 in any event and argued that the primary effect of the purported Comintern communiqu\u00e9 fell on Anglo-Soviet relations:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Under Baldwin, the British Government led the diplomatic retreat from Moscow. Soviet Russia became more isolated, and, of necessity, more isolationist. [...]\nThe Zinoviev letter hardened attitudes, and hardened them at a time when the Soviet Union was becoming more amenable to diplomatic contact with the capitalist world. The proponents of world revolution were being superseded by more pliant subscribers to the Stalin's philosophy of \"Building Socialism in One Country\". Thus, after successfully weathering all the early contradictions in Soviet Diplomacy, Britain gave up when the going was about to become much easier. And it gave up largely because the two middle-class parties suddenly perceived that their short-term electoral advantage was best served by a violent anti-Bolshevik campaign.\nCurrent scholarship.\nContemporary scholarship on the Zinoviev letter dates from a 1967 monograph published by three British journalists working for \"The Sunday Times\". The authors, Lewis Chester, Steven Fay and Hugo Young, asserted that two members of a Russian monarchist organisation called the \"Brotherhood of St. George\" composed the document in Berlin. Irina Bellegarde, the widow of Alexis Bellegarde, one of the two men said to have written the document, stated that she had witnessed the forgery as it was performed. She said that her husband had drafted the letter after fellow-\u00e9migr\u00e9 Alexander Gumansky told him that a request to forge the letter had come from \"a person in authority in London\". Gurmansky and Bellegarde were later sentenced to death \"in absentia\" by a Soviet court. Bellegarde was later forced to work during the Second World War for the Russian section of the Abwehr (German military intelligence) in Berlin. Some evidence suggests that he was the highly effective British double agent known as \"Outcast\". He had been an important source on Soviet matters for the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS; commonly known as MI6) since the First World War, raising the possibility that he already had deep links to British intelligence when involved in the fabrication of the Zinoviev letter.\nThe forgers appear to have studied Bolshevik documents and signatures extensively before creating the letter to undermine the Soviet regime's relations with the United Kingdom. The British Foreign Office had received the forgery on 10 October 1924, two days after the defeat of the MacDonald government on the no-confidence motion initiated by the Liberals. Despite the dubious nature of the document, wheels were set in motion for its publication, members of the Conservative Party combining with Foreign Office officials in what Chester, Fay, and Young characterised as a \"conspiracy\".\nThese findings and allegations motivated the British Foreign Office to undertake a study of their own. For three years, Milicent Bagot of MI5 examined the archives and conducted interviews with surviving witnesses. She produced a long account of the affair, but the paper ultimately proved unpublishable because it contained sensitive operational and personnel information. Nevertheless, Bagot's work proved important as a secondary source when the Foreign Office revisited the matter three decades later.\nIn the first two months of 1998, rumours of a forthcoming book on the true origins of the Zinoviev letter, based on information from Soviet archives, led to renewed press speculation and parliamentary questions. In response, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook announced on 12 February that, in the interests of openness, he had commissioned the historians of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to prepare a historical memorandum on the Zinoviev letter, drawing upon archival documents.\nA paper by the Chief Historian of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Gill Bennett, was published in January 1999 and contains the results of this inquiry. Bennett had free and unfettered access to the archives of the Foreign Office, as well as those of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) and MI5. She also visited Moscow in the course of her research, working in the archives of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Comintern archive of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Although not every operational detail could be published because of British secrecy laws, the publicly available extracts of Bennett's paper still provided a rich account of the Zinoviev letter affair. Her report showed that the letter contained statements very similar to those made by Zinoviev to other communist parties and at other times to the CPGB, but at the time of the letter (when Anglo-Soviet trade talks were taking place and a general election was impending), Zinoviev and the Soviet government had adopted a more restrained attitude towards propaganda in Britain. Despite her extensive research, she concluded \"it is impossible to say who wrote the Zinoviev Letter\", though her best guess was that it was commissioned by White Russian intelligence circles from forgers in Berlin or the Baltic states, most likely in Riga. It was then leaked to the papers, probably by MI6, that she had stated, \"I have my doubts as to whether [Desmond Morton] thought it was genuine but he treated it as if it was.\"\nIn 2006, Bennett incorporated some of her findings on the Zinoviev letter into chapter four of her biography of SIS agent Desmond Morton. Another 2006 book on spycraft attributes authorship to Vladimir Orlov, a former intelligence agent of Baron Wrangel during the Russian Civil War. The British historian Nigel West wrote that the OGPU (Soviet secret police) always initiated investigations into leaks of Soviet documents and into mishandlings of propaganda, and the fact no investigation was opened after the publication of the Zinoviev letter indicates it was certainly a forgery.\nIn 2017, the British government stated that it had lost a file on the Zinoviev letter scandal. The government added that they were unable to determine whether copies of the material had been made.\nIn 2018, Bennett published her book \"The Zinoviev Letter: The Conspiracy that Never Dies\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Infection can lead to damage of the nerves, respiratory tract, skin, and eyes. This nerve damage may result in the loss of nociception, which can lead to the loss of parts of a person's extremities from repeated injuries or infection through unnoticed wounds. An infected person may also experience muscle weakness and loss of eyesight. Leprosy symptoms may begin within one year or take 20 years or more.\nLeprosy is spread between people, although extensive contact is necessary. Leprosy has a low pathogenicity, and 95% of people who contract or who are exposed to \"M. leprae\" do not develop the disease. Spread is likely through a cough or contact with fluid from the nose of a person infected by leprosy. Genetic factors and baseline immune function play a role in how easily a person catches the disease. Leprosy is not spread during pregnancy to the unborn child or through sexual contact. Leprosy occurs more commonly among people living in poverty. There are two main types of the disease\u2014paucibacillary and multibacillary, which differ in the number of bacteria present. A person with paucibacillary disease has five or fewer poorly pigmented, numb skin patches, while a person with multibacillary disease has more than five skin patches. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding acid-fast bacilli in a biopsy of the skin.\nLeprosy is curable with multidrug therapy. Treatment of paucibacillary leprosy is with the medications dapsone, rifampicin, and clofazimine for six months. Treatment for multibacillary leprosy uses the same medications for 12 months. Several other antibiotics may also be used. These treatments are provided free of charge by the World Health Organization.\nLeprosy is not highly contagious. People with leprosy can live with their families and attend school and work. In the 1980s, there were 5.2\u00a0million cases globally, but by 2020 this decreased to fewer than 200,000. Most new cases occur in one of 14 countries, with India accounting for more than half of all new cases. In the 20 years from 1994 to 2014, 16\u00a0million people worldwide were cured of leprosy. Separating people affected by leprosy by placing them in leper colonies is not supported by evidence but still occurs in some areas of India, China, Japan, Africa, and Thailand.\nLeprosy has affected humanity for thousands of years. The disease takes its name from the Greek word (), from (; 'scale'), while the term \"Hansen's disease\" is named after the Norwegian physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen. Leprosy has historically been associated with social stigma, which continues to be a barrier to self-reporting and early treatment. Leprosy is classified as a neglected tropical disease. World Leprosy Day was started in 1954 to draw awareness to those affected by leprosy.\nThe study of leprosy and its treatment is known as leprology.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSigns and symptoms.\nCommon symptoms present in the different types of leprosy include a rhinorrhea; dry scalp; vision problems; skin lesions; muscle weakness; reddish skin; smooth, shiny, diffuse thickening of facial skin, ear, and hand tissues; loss of sensation in fingers and toes; thickening of peripheral nerves; a flat nose from the destruction of nasal cartilage; and changes in phonation and other aspects of speech production. In addition, atrophy of the testes and erectile dysfunction may occur.\nLeprosy onset varies between individuals. The average incubation period is five years, but the infected may begin to notice symptoms within the first year or up to 20 years after infection. Oftentimes, the first noticeable sign of leprosy is the development of pale or pink-coloured patches of skin that may be insensitive to temperature or pain. Patches of discolored skin are sometimes accompanied or preceded by nerve problems, including numbness or tenderness in the hands or feet. Secondary infections (bacterial or viral infections consequent to the primary infection) can result in tissue loss, causing fingers and toes to become shortened and deformed as cartilage is absorbed into the body. Baseline immune function drives at least some parts of pathogenesis variability.\nApproximately 30% of individuals affected by leprosy experience nerve damage. The nerve damage sustained is reversible when treated early, but becomes permanent when appropriate treatment is delayed by several months. Damage to nerves may cause loss of muscle function, leading to paralysis. It may also lead to sensation abnormalities or numbness, leading to additional infections, ulcerations, and joint deformities.\nCause.\n\"M. leprae\" and \"M. lepromatosis\".\n\"Mycobacterium leprae\" and \"Mycobacterium lepromatosis\" are the mycobacteria that cause leprosy. \"M. lepromatosis\" is a relatively newly identified mycobacterium isolated from a fatal case of diffuse lepromatous leprosy in 2008. \"M. lepromatosis\" is indistinguishable clinically from \"M. leprae\". \"M. leprae\" is an aerobic, rod-shaped, acid-fast bacterium with a waxy cell envelope characteristic of the genus \"Mycobacterium\". \"M. leprae\" and \"M. lepromatosis\" are obligate intracellular pathogens and cannot grow or be cultured outside of host tissues. However, they can be grown using research animals such as mice and armadillos.\nNaturally occurring infections have been reported in nonhuman primates (including the African chimpanzee, the sooty mangabey, and the cynomolgus macaque), armadillos, and red squirrels. Multilocus sequence typing of the armadillo \"M. leprae\" strains suggests that they were of human origin for at most a few hundred years. Thus, it is suspected that armadillos first acquired the organism incidentally from early European explorers of the Americas. This incidental transmission was sustained in the armadillo population. It may be transmitted back to humans, making leprosy a zoonotic disease (spread between humans and animals).\nRed squirrels (\"Sciurus vulgaris\"), a threatened species in Great Britain, were found to carry leprosy in November 2016. It has been suggested that the trade in red squirrel fur, highly prized in the medieval period and intensively traded, may have been responsible for the leprosy epidemic in medieval Europe. A pre-Norman era skull excavated in Hoxne, Suffolk, in 2017 was found to carry DNA from a strain of \"M. leprae\" which closely matched the strain carried by modern red squirrels on Brownsea Island.\nRisk factors.\nThe greatest risk factor for developing leprosy is contact with another person infected with leprosy. People who are exposed to a person who has leprosy are 5\u20138 times more likely to develop leprosy than members of the general population. Leprosy occurs more commonly among those living in poverty. Not all people who are infected with \"M. leprae\" develop symptoms.\nConditions that reduce immune function, such as malnutrition, other illnesses, or genetic mutations, may increase the risk of developing leprosy. Infection with HIV does not appear to increase the risk of developing leprosy. Certain genetic factors in the person exposed have been associated with developing lepromatous or tuberculoid leprosy.\nTransmission.\nTransmission of leprosy occurs during close contact with those who are infected. Transmission of leprosy is through the upper respiratory tract. Older research suggested the skin as the main route of transmission, but research has increasingly favored the respiratory route. Transmission occurs through inhalation of bacilli present in upper airway secretion.\nLeprosy is not sexually transmitted and is not spread through pregnancy to the unborn child. The majority (95%) of people who are exposed to \"M. leprae\" do not develop leprosy; casual contact such as shaking hands and sitting next to someone with leprosy does not lead to transmission. People are considered non-infectious 72 hours after starting appropriate multi-drug therapy. Two exit routes of \"M. leprae\" from the human body that are often described are the skin and the nasal mucosa, although their relative importance is not clear. Lepromatous cases show large numbers of organisms deep in the dermis, but whether they reach the skin surface in sufficient numbers is doubtful. Humans can acquire a leprosy infection from armadillos by handling them or consuming armadillo meat. The mechanism is not fully understood.\nGenetics.\nNot all people infected or exposed to \"M. leprae\" develop leprosy, and genetic factors are suspected to play a role in susceptibility to an infection. Cases of leprosy often cluster in families, and several genetic variants have been identified. In many who are exposed, the immune system can eliminate the leprosy bacteria during the early infection stage before severe symptoms develop. A genetic defect in cell-mediated immunity may cause a person to be susceptible to develop leprosy symptoms after exposure to the bacteria. The region of DNA responsible for this variability is also involved in Parkinson's disease, giving rise to current speculation that the two disorders may be linked at the biochemical level.\nPathogenesis.\nMost leprosy complications are the result of nerve damage. The nerve damage occurs due to direct invasion by the \"M. leprae\" bacteria and a person's immune response, resulting in inflammation. The molecular mechanism underlying how \"M. leprae\" produces the symptoms of leprosy is not clear, but \"M. leprae\" has been shown to bind to Schwann cells, which may lead to nerve injury including demyelination and a loss of nerve function (specifically a loss of axonal conductance). Numerous molecular mechanisms have been associated with this nerve damage including the presence of a laminin-binding protein and the glycoconjugate (PGL-1) on the surface of \"M. leprae\" that can bind to laminin on peripheral nerves.\nAs part of the human immune response, white blood cell-derived macrophages may engulf \"M. leprae\" by phagocytosis. In the initial stages, small sensory and autonomic nerve fibers in the skin of a person with leprosy are damaged. This damage usually results in hair loss to the area, a loss of the ability to sweat, and numbness (decreased ability to detect sensations such as temperature and touch). Further peripheral nerve damage may result in skin dryness, more numbness, and muscle weakness or paralysis in the affected area. The skin can crack, and if the skin injuries are not carefully cared for, there is a risk for a secondary infection that can lead to more severe damage.\nImmunology.\nLeprosy exhibits polarized host responses along a Th1\u2013Th2 spectrum that underpins the Ridley\u2013Jopling clinicopathological forms. At the tuberculoid pole (TT/BT), cellular immunity is dominated by Th1 cytokines\u2014notably IL-12, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1\u2014which activate macrophages, favor granuloma organization, and restrict bacillary multiplication; at the lepromatous pole (BL/LL), there is Th2/regulatory bias (e.g., IL-4, IL-10), weaker cell-mediated immunity, and high bacillary loads with widespread dissemination. This polarization is shaped by antigen-presenting cell function and pattern-recognition events: recognition of mycobacterial ligands by Toll-like receptors\u2014particularly TLR1/2 heterodimers on macrophages, dendritic cells, and Schwann cells\u2014drives Th1-skewing in paucibacillary disease, whereas IL-10-rich regulatory circuits dampen effector responses at the multibacillary pole.\nHistopathology reflects these immune states. Tuberculoid lesions show well-formed granulomas composed of epithelioid macrophages and multinucleated giant cells with dense T-cell cuffs, consistent with attempts at bacillary containment; bacilli are scant and often absent on routine sections. By contrast, lepromatous lesions display diffuse sheets of vacuolated \"foamy\" macrophages packed with bacilli (including globi), fewer cytotoxic effectors, and more permissive tissue microenvironments. Macrophage programs diverge across the spectrum: microbicidal, nitric-oxide\u2013producing phenotypes are more characteristic of the Th1 side, whereas alternative (M2-like), lipid-rich programs prevail at the Th2/regulatory pole.\nAdditional T-cell axes contribute to bacterial control and tissue damage: Th17/IL-17 responses, typically higher in tuberculoid disease, align with granulomatous inflammation, while FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells and TGF-\u03b2/IL-10 pathways are more prominent in multibacillary disease and can suppress protective immunity. Superimposed acute \"reactions\" represent abrupt shifts on this immunologic continuum. Type 1 (reversal) reactions, usually in borderline disease, involve amplification of Th1-driven inflammation with edema of pre-existing lesions and neuritis. Type 2 reactions (erythema nodosum leprosum) are systemic inflammatory episodes linked to high antigen load and immune-complex formation, with fever, tender nodules, neutrophilia, and other organ involvement; their pathobiology features surges of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8 and neutrophil-rich infiltrates.\nBeyond T cells and macrophages, humoral immunity and B-cell subsets are also implicated. B-1\u2013like cells (by PAX5/CD5 labeling) and marginal zone B cells in human cutaneous lesions\u2014together with Be1 cells\u2014were more abundant in tuberculoid and type 1 reaction lesions than in lepromatous, type 2 reaction, and indeterminate forms, consistent with Th1-skewed inflammation; IL-10\u2013producing regulatory B cells were infrequent. These findings expand the repertoire of cellular players involved at the paucibacillary/Th1 pole of the leprosy spectrum.\nDiagnosis.\nIn countries where people are frequently infected, a person is considered to have leprosy if they have one of the following two signs:\nSkin lesions can be single or multiple, usually hypopigmented, although occasionally reddish or copper-colored. The lesions may be flat (macules), raised (papules), or solid elevated areas (nodular). Experiencing sensory loss at the skin lesion is a feature that can help determine if the lesion is caused by leprosy or by another disorder such as tinea versicolor. Thickened nerves are associated with leprosy and can be accompanied by loss of sensation or muscle weakness, but muscle weakness without the characteristic skin lesion and sensory loss is not considered a reliable sign of leprosy. In some cases, the presence of acid-fast leprosy bacilli in skin smears is considered diagnostic; however, the diagnosis is typically made without laboratory tests, based on symptoms. If a person has a new leprosy diagnosis and already has a visible disability caused by leprosy, the diagnosis is considered late.\nIn countries or areas where leprosy is uncommon, such as the United States, diagnosis of leprosy is often delayed because healthcare providers are unaware of leprosy and its symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment prevent nerve involvement, the hallmark of leprosy, and the disability it causes. There is no recommended test to diagnose latent leprosy in people without symptoms. Few people with latent leprosy test positive for anti PGL-1. The presence of \"M. leprae\" bacterial DNA can be identified using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique. This molecular test alone is not sufficient to diagnose a person, but this approach may be used to identify someone who is at high risk of developing or transmitting leprosy such as those with few lesions or an atypical clinical presentation. New approaches propose tools to diagnose leprosy through artificial intelligence.\nClassification.\nSeveral approaches for classifying leprosy exist. There are similarities between the classification approaches.\nLeprosy may also occur with only neural involvement, without skin lesions.\nComplications.\nLeprosy causes tissue loss and deformity by attacking nerve endings, leading to loss of sensation and increased injury risk. Injuries can become infected, causing tissue damage and shortening of fingers, toes, and limbs.\nPrevention.\nEarly disease detection is important, since physical and neurological damage may be irreversible even if cured. Medications can decrease the risk of those living with people who have leprosy from acquiring the disease, and likely those with whom people with leprosy come into contact outside the home. The WHO recommends that preventive medicine be given to people who are in close contact with someone who has leprosy. The suggested preventive treatment is a single dose of rifampicin in adults and children over 2 years old who do not already have leprosy or tuberculosis. Preventive treatment is associated with a 57% reduction in infections within 2 years and a 30% reduction in infections within 6 years.\nThe Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine offers a variable amount of protection against leprosy in addition to its closely related target of tuberculosis. It appears to be 26% to 41% effective (based on controlled trials) and about 60% effective based on observational studies, with two doses possibly working better than one. The WHO concluded in 2018 that the BCG vaccine at birth reduces leprosy risk and is recommended in countries with high incidence of TB and people who have leprosy. People living in the same home as a person with leprosy are suggested to take a BCG booster which may improve their immunity by 56%. Development of a more effective vaccine is ongoing.\nA novel vaccine called LepVax entered clinical trials in 2017 with the first encouraging results reported on 24 participants published in 2020. If successful, this would be the first leprosy-specific vaccine available.\nTreatment.\nSeveral leprostatic agents are available for treatment. A three-drug regimen of rifampicin, dapsone, and clofazimine is recommended for all people with leprosy, for six months for paucibacillary leprosy and 12 months for multibacillary leprosy. Multidrug therapy (MDT) remains highly effective, and people are no longer infectious after the first monthly dose. MDT is safe and easy to use under field conditions because it is available in calendar-labelled blister packs. The treatment does pose compliance challenges for young children who find swallowing multiple solid pills difficult. Post-treatment relapse rates remain low.\nThe combination treatment accelerates treatment and decreases the chance of creating drug-resistant bacteria. All three drugs in the three-drug regimen are antibacterial, with rifampicin being the most potent. Rifampicin is scheduled monthly since it interferes with dapsone by inducing its increased metabolism.\nResistance to the three-drug regimen has been reported in several countries, although the number of cases is small. People with rifampicin-resistant leprosy may be treated with second-line medications such as fluoroquinolones, minocycline, or clarithromycin, but the treatment duration is 24 months because of their lower bactericidal activity. Evidence on the potential benefits and harms of alternative regimens for drug-resistant leprosy is not available.\nFor people with nerve damage, protective footwear may help prevent ulcers and secondary infections. Canvas shoes may be better than PVC boots. There may be no difference between double rocker shoes and below-knee plaster. Topical ketanserin seems to have a better effect on ulcer healing than clioquinol cream or zinc paste, but the evidence for this is weak. Phenytoin applied to the skin improves skin changes to a greater degree when compared to saline dressings.\nOutcomes.\nAlthough leprosy has been curable since the mid-20th century, left untreated, it can cause permanent physical impairments and damage to a person's nerves, skin, eyes, and limbs. Despite leprosy not being very infectious and having a low pathogenicity, there is still significant stigma and prejudice associated with the disease. Because of this stigma, leprosy can affect a person's participation in social activities and may also affect the lives of their family and friends. People with leprosy are also at a higher risk for problems with their mental well-being. The social stigma may contribute to problems obtaining employment, financial difficulties, and social isolation. Efforts to reduce discrimination and reduce the stigma surrounding leprosy may help improve outcomes for people with leprosy.\nEpidemiology.\nIn 2018, 208,619 new cases of leprosy were recorded, a slight decrease from 2017. In 2015, 94% of the new leprosy cases were confined to 14 countries. India reported the greatest number of new cases (60% of reported cases), followed by Brazil (13%) and Indonesia (8%). Although the number of cases worldwide continues to fall, there are parts of the world where leprosy is more common, including Brazil, South Asia (India, Nepal, Bhutan), some parts of Africa (Tanzania, Madagascar, Mozambique), and the western Pacific. About 150 to 250 cases are diagnosed in the United States each year.\nIn the 1960s, there were tens of millions of leprosy cases recorded when the bacteria started to develop resistance to dapsone, the most common treatment option at the time. International (e.g., the WHO's \"Global Strategy for Reducing Disease Burden Due to Leprosy\" and the International Federation of Anti-Leprosy Associations) and national initiatives have reduced the total number and the number of new cases of the disease.\nThe number of new leprosy cases is difficult to measure and monitor because of leprosy's long incubation period, delays in diagnosis after the onset of the disease, and lack of medical care in affected areas. The registered prevalence of the disease is used to determine disease burden. Registered prevalence is a useful proxy indicator of the disease burden, as it reflects the number of active leprosy cases diagnosed with the disease and receiving treatment with MDT at a given point in time. The prevalence rate is defined as the number of cases registered for MDT treatment among the population in which the cases have occurred, again at a given point in time.\nHistory.\nHistorical distribution.\nUsing comparative genomics, in 2005, geneticists traced the origins and worldwide distribution of leprosy from East Africa or the Near East along human migration routes. They found four strains of \"M. leprae\" with specific regional locations: Monot \"et al.\" (2005) determined that leprosy originated in East Africa or the Near East and traveled with humans along their migration routes, including those of trade in goods and slaves. The four strains of \"M. leprae\" are based in specific geographic regions where each predominantly occurs:\nThis confirms the spread of the disease along the migration, colonisation, and slave trade routes taken from East Africa to India, West Africa to the New World, and from Africa to Europe and vice versa.\nSkeletal remains discovered in 2009 represent the oldest documented evidence for leprosy, dating to the 2nd millennium BC. Located at Balathal, Rajasthan, in northwest India, the discoverers suggest that if the disease did migrate from Africa to India during the 3rd millennium BC \"at a time when there was substantial interaction among the Indus Civilization, Mesopotamia, and Egypt, there needs to be additional skeletal and molecular evidence of leprosy in India and Africa to confirm the African origin of the disease\". A proven human case was verified by DNA taken from the shrouded remains of a man discovered by researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in a tomb in Akeldama, next to the Old City of Jerusalem dated by radiocarbon methods to the first half of the 1st century.\nThe oldest strains of leprosy known from Europe are from Great Chesterford in southeast England and date back to AD 415\u2013545. These findings suggest a different path for the spread of leprosy, meaning it may have originated in Western Eurasia. This study also indicates that there were more strains in Europe at the time than previously determined.\nDiscovery and scientific progress.\nLiterary attestation of leprosy is unclear because of the ambiguity of many early sources, including the Indian Atharvaveda and Kausika Sutra, the Egyptian Ebers Papyrus, and the Hebrew Bible's various sections regarding signs of impurity (\"tzaraath\"). Leprotic symptoms are attested in the Indian doctor Sushruta's \"Compendium\", originally dating to c.\u00a0600\u00a0BC but only surviving in emended texts no earlier than the 5th century BC. Symptoms consistent with leprosy were possibly described by Hippocrates in 460\u00a0BC. However, Hansen's disease probably did not exist in Greece or the Middle East before the Common Era. In 1846, Francis Adams produced \"The Seven Books of Paulus Aegineta\" which included a commentary on all medical and surgical knowledge and descriptions and remedies to do with leprosy from the Romans, Greeks, and Arabs.\nThe first known causative agent of leprosy, \"M. leprae\", was discovered by Gerhard Armauer Hansen in Norway in 1873, making it one of the first species of pathogenic bacteria to be identified. Leprosy was once believed to have been absent from the Americas before the age of Discovery and the arrival of Europeans. In 2008, a different causative agent for leprosy, \"Mycobacterium lepromatosis\" was discovered. DNA studies have revealed that this pathogen exists primarily in the Americas and was already present before Europeans arrived.\nIt is believed that it did not exist in Polynesia until the middle of the 19th century.\nTreatment.\nChaulmoogra tree oil was used topically to manage Hansen's disease for centuries. Chaulmoogra oil could not be taken orally without causing nausea or injected without forming an abscess. Leprosy was once believed to be highly contagious and was treated with mercury, as was syphilis, which was first described in 1530. Many early cases thought to be leprosy could actually have been syphilis. In 1915, Alice Ball, the first black woman to graduate from the University of Hawai\u02bbi with a master's in chemistry, discovered how to make the oil water-soluble. This technique led to marked improvements in patients with Hansen's disease who were treated in Hawai\u02bbi.\nThe first effective drug (promin) became available in the 1940s. In the 1950s, dapsone was introduced. The search for further effective antileprosy drugs led to the use of clofazimine and rifampicin in the 1960s and 1970s. Later, Indian scientist Shantaram Yawalkar and his colleagues formulated a combined therapy using rifampicin and dapsone, intended to mitigate bacterial resistance. Combining all three drugs was first recommended by the WHO in 1981. These three drugs are still used in the standard MDT regimens. Resistance has developed to initial treatment. Until the introduction of MDT in the early 1980s, leprosy could not be diagnosed and treated successfully within the community.\nThe importance of the nasal mucosa in the transmission of \"M. leprae\" was recognized as early as 1898 by Sch\u00e4ffer, particularly the ulcerated mucosa. The mechanism of plantar ulceration in leprosy and its treatment was first described by Ernest W. Price.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"leprosy\" comes from the Greek word \"\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 (l\u00e9pos) \u2013 skin\" and \"\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (leper\u00f3s) \u2013 scaly man\".\nSociety and culture.\nTreatment cost.\nBetween 1995 and 1999, the WHO, with the aid of the Nippon Foundation, supplied all endemic countries with free MDT in blister packs, channeled through ministries of health. This free provision was extended in 2000 and again in 2005, 2010, and 2015 with donations by the MDT manufacturer Novartis through the WHO. At the national level, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) affiliated with the national program will continue to be provided with an appropriate free supply.\nHistorical texts.\nWritten accounts of leprosy date back thousands of years. By 600 BC, various skin diseases translated as leprosy appear in the \"Atharava Veda\", a principle Hindu scripture. Another Hindu scripture, the \"Manusmriti\" (200 BC), prohibits contact with those infected with the disease and makes marriage to a person infected with leprosy punishable.\nThe Hebraic root tsara or tsaraath (\u05e6\u05b8\u05e8\u05b7\u05e2, \u2013 tsaw-rah' \u2013 to be struck with leprosy, to be leprous) and the Greek (\u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \u2013 lepros), are of broader classification than the more narrow use of the term related to Hansen's Disease. Any progressive skin disease (a whitening or splotchy bleaching of the skin, raised manifestations of scales, scabs, infections, rashes, etc.) \u2014 as well as generalized molds and surface discoloration of any clothing, leather, or discoloration on walls or surfaces throughout homes \u2014 all came under the \"law of leprosy\" (Leviticus 14:54\u201357). Ancient sources such as the Talmud (Sifra 63) make clear that\" tzaraath\" refers to various types of lesions or stains associated with ritual impurity and occurring on cloth, leather, or houses, as well as skin. Traditional Judaism and Jewish rabbinical authorities, both historical and modern, emphasize that the \"tsaraath\" of Leviticus is a spiritual ailment with no direct relationship to Hansen's disease or physical contagions. The relation of \"tsaraath\" to \"leprosy\" comes from translations of Hebrew Biblical texts into Greek and ensuing misconceptions.\nAll three Synoptic Gospels of the New Testament describe instances of Jesus healing people with leprosy (https://, https://, and https://). The Bible's description of leprosy is congruous (if lacking detail) with the symptoms of modern leprosy, but the relationship between this disease, \"tzaraath\", and Hansen's disease has been disputed. The biblical perception that people with leprosy were unclean can be found in a passage from https://. While this text defines the leper as impure, it does not explicitly make a moral judgement on those with leprosy. Some early Christians believed that God was punishing those affected by leprosy for sinful behavior. Moral associations have persisted throughout history. In the 6th century, Pope Gregory the Great and Isidore of Seville considered people with the disease to be heretics.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe general population's perception of leprosy was mixed. On one hand, people feared getting infected with the disease and thought of people suspected of leprosy to be unclean, untrustworthy, and occasionally morally corrupt. On the other hand, Jesus' interaction with lepers, the writing of church leaders, and the Christian focus on charitable works led to viewing the lepers as \"chosen by God\" or seeing the disease as a means of obtaining access to heaven.\nEarly medieval understanding of leprosy was influenced by early Christian writers such as Gregory of Nazianzus and John Chrysostom, whose writings were later embraced by Byzantine and Latin writers. Gregory, for example, composed sermons urging Christians to assist victims of the disease, and he condemned pagans or Christians who justified rejecting lepers on the allegation that God had sent them the disease to punish them. As cases of leprosy increased in the Eastern Roman Empire, becoming a major health issue, the ecclesiastic leaders discussed how to assist those affected as well as how to change the attitude of society towards them. They also tried this by using the name \"holy disease\" instead of the commonly used \"elephant's disease\" (elephantiasis), implying that God did not create this disease to punish people but to purify them for heaven. Although not always successful in persuading the public and a cure was never found by Greek medicians, they created an environment where victims could get palliative care and were never expressly banned from society, as sometimes happened in western Europe. Theodore Balsamon, a 12th-century jurist in Constantinople, noted that lepers were allowed to enter the same churches, cities, and assemblies that healthy people attended.\nAs the disease became more prevalent in Western Europe in the 5th century, efforts began to establish permanent institutions to house and feed lepers. These efforts were, inclusively, the work of bishops in France at the end of the sixth century, such as in Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne. The increase in hospitals or leprosaria (sing. leprosarium) that treated people with leprosy in the 12th and 13th century seems to indicate a rise in cases, possibly in connection with the increase in urbanisation as well as returning crusaders from the Middle East. France alone had nearly 2,000 leprosaria during this period. Additionally to the new leprosia, further steps were taken by secular and religious leaders to prevent further spread of the disease. The third Lateran Council of 1179 required lepers to have their own priests and churches and a 1346 edict by King Edward expelled lepers from city limits. Segregation from mainstream society became common, and people with leprosy were often required to wear clothing that identified them as such or carry a bell announcing their presence. As in the East, it was the Church who took care of the lepers due to the persisting moral stigma and who ran the leprosaria. Although the leprosaria in Western Europe removed the sick from society, they were never a place to quarantine them or from which they could not leave: lepers would go beg for alms for the upkeep of the leprosaria or meet with their families.\nMultiple groups in Western Europe from the Middle Ages faced social ostracization and discrimination that was justified, in part, due to claims that they were the descendants of lepers. These groups included the Cagots and the Caquins.\n19th century.\nNorway was the location of a progressive stance on leprosy tracking and treatment, and played an influential role in European understanding of the disease. In 1832, Dr. JJ Hjort conducted the first leprosy survey, thus establishing a basis for epidemiological surveys. Subsequent surveys led to the establishment of a national leprosy registry to study the causes of leprosy and to track the rate of infection. Early leprosy research throughout Europe was conducted by Norwegian scientists Daniel Cornelius Danielssen and Carl Wilhelm Boeck. Their work resulted in the establishment of the National Leprosy Research and Treatment Center. Danielssen and Boeck believed the cause of leprosy transmission was hereditary. This stance was influential in advocating for the isolation of those infected by sex to prevent reproduction.\nThough leprosy rates were on the decline in the Western world by the 1860s, authorities frequently embraced isolation treatment due to a combination of reasons, including fears of the disease spreading from the Global South, efforts by Christian missionaries and a lack of understanding concerning bacteriology, medical diagnosis and how contagious the disease was. The rapid expansion of Western imperialism during the Victorian era resulted in westerners coming into increasing contact with regions where the disease was endemic, including British India. English surgeon Henry Vandyke Carter observed isolation treatment for leprosy patients first-hand while visiting Norway, applying these methods in British India with the financial and logistical assistance of Protestant missionaries. Colonialist and religious viewpoints of the disease continued to be a major factor in the treatment and public perception of the disease in the Global South until decolonization in the mid-20th century.\n20th and 21st century.\nIn 1898, the colonial government in British India enacted the Leprosy Act of 1898, which mandated the compulsory segregation of people with leprosy by authorities in newly established leper asylums, where they were segregated by sex to prevent sexual activity. The act, which proved difficult to enforce, was repealed in 1983 by the Indian government after MDT had become widely available in India. In 1983, the National Leprosy Elimination Programme, previously the National Leprosy Control Programme, changed its methods from surveillance to the treatment of people with leprosy. India still accounts for over half of the global disease burden. According to the WHO, new cases in India during 2019 diminished to 114,451 patients (57% of the world's total new cases). Until 2019, Indians could justify a petition for divorce with their spouse's diagnosis of leprosy.\nThe National Leprosarium at Carville, Louisiana, known in 1955 as the Louisiana Leper Home, was the only leprosy hospital in the mainland United States. Leprosy patients from all over the United States were sent to Carville to be kept in isolation away from the public, as not much about leprosy transmission was known at the time, and stigma against those with leprosy was high. The Carville leprosarium was known for its innovations in reconstructive surgery for those with leprosy. In 1941, 22 patients at Carville underwent trials for a new drug called Promin. The results were described as miraculous, and soon after the success of promin came dapsone, a medicine even more effective in the fight against leprosy. Leprosy incidence peaked in the United States in 1983, followed by a steep decline. However, case numbers have been slowly rising again since 2000. In 2020, 159 cases were reported in the country.\nStigma.\nDespite effective treatment and education efforts, leprosy stigma remains problematic in developing countries where the disease is common. Leprosy is most common amongst impoverished populations where social stigma is likely to be compounded by poverty. Fears of ostracism, job loss, or expulsion from family and society may contribute to a delayed diagnosis and treatment.\nFolk beliefs, lack of education, and religious connotations of the disease continue to influence social perceptions of those affected in many parts of the world. In Brazil, for example, folklore holds that leprosy is a disease transmitted by dogs, or that it is associated with sexual promiscuity, or that it is a punishment for sins or moral transgressions (distinct from other diseases and misfortunes, which are in general thought of as being according to the will of God). Socioeconomic factors also have a direct impact. Lower-class domestic workers who are often employed by those in a higher socioeconomic class may find their employment in jeopardy as physical manifestations of the disease become apparent. Skin discoloration and darker pigmentation resulting from the disease also have social repercussions.\nIn extreme cases in northern India, leprosy is equated with an \"untouchable\" status that \"often persists long after individuals with leprosy have been cured of the disease, creating lifelong prospects of divorce, eviction, loss of employment, and ostracism from family and social networks.\"\nPublic policy.\nThe World Health Organization maintains an Expert Committee on Leprosy since 1954, and a goal of the WHO is to \"eliminate leprosy.\" In 2016 the organization launched \"Global Leprosy Strategy 2016\u20132020: Accelerating towards a leprosy-free world\". Elimination of leprosy is defined as \"reducing the proportion of (people with) leprosy in the community to very low levels, specifically to below one case per 10,000 population\". Diagnosis and treatment with multidrug therapy are effective, and a 45% decline in disease burden has occurred since MDT has become more widely available. The organization emphasizes the importance of fully integrating leprosy treatment into public health services, effective diagnosis and treatment, and access to information. The approach includes supporting an increase in health care professionals who understand the disease, and a coordinated and renewed political commitment that includes coordination between countries and improvements in the methodology for collecting and analysing data.\nInterventions include:\nIn some instances in India, community-based rehabilitation is embraced by local governments and NGOs alike. Often, the identity cultivated by a community environment is preferable to reintegration, and models of self-management and collective agency independent of NGOs and government support have been desirable and successful.\nInfection of animals.\nBetween 15 and 20% of nine-banded armadillos (\"Dasypus novemcinctus\") in the south-central United States carry \"M. leprae\". As a result of their low body temperature, their tissues commonly contain massive numbers of organisms, which help in the dissemination of the infection. Armadillos were first demonstrated in 1971 to develop leprosy after inoculation with \"M. leprae\". Because of armadillos' armor, skin lesions are difficult to ascertain. Abrasions around the eyes, nose, and feet are the most common signs. Infected armadillos make up a large reservoir of \"M. leprae.\" They may be a source of infection for some humans in the United States or other locations in the armadillos' home range. In armadillo leprosy, lesions do not persist at the site of entry in animals; \"M. leprae\" multiply in macrophages at the site of inoculation and lymph nodes.\nArmadillos have been used in immunological research to fight leprosy. Some notable reagents include recombinant interleukin-2 and recombinant interferon-gamma reagents. Additionally, they have been key and have been useful models of leprosy for studies regarding neuropathy. In clinical procedures such as electrophysiological nerve conduction tests Armadillo's nerve function has been properly assessed. Despite the studies mentioned regarding Armadillo's relationship to neuropathy and other effects of leprosy, there is still a lack of proper study on armadillos, and in conducting more armadillo-specific regents, our understanding of leprosy's effects on armadillos and possible humans can be found. Armadillos are a key component of modern-day research on leprosy.\nThere is a stigma surrounding armadillos and the carrying of leprosy. Because many people do not understand armadillos very well, it is common for people to think of them as being dangerous to society and, as a result, valuing their lives less than other animals. It has become more common in parts of America for people to eat raw or undercooked armadillo, making the chances high that, if not properly handled with care, one may become infected.\nAn outbreak in chimpanzees in West Africa showed that the bacteria can infect another species and may have additional rodent hosts. Studies have demonstrated that the disease is endemic in the UK red Eurasian squirrel population, with \"M. leprae\" and \"M. lepromatosis\" appearing in different populations. The \"M. leprae\" strain discovered on Brownsea Island is equated to one thought to have died out in the human population in medieval times. Despite this, and speculation regarding past transmission through trade in squirrel furs, there does not seem to be a high risk of squirrel to human transmission from the wild population. Although leprosy continues to be diagnosed in immigrants to the UK, the last known human case of leprosy arising in the UK was recorded over 200 years ago.\nIt has been shown that leprosy can reprogram cells in mouse and armadillo models, similar to how induced pluripotent stem cells are generated by the transcription factors Myc, Oct3/4, Sox2, and Klf4. A notable study conducted by Charles Shepard used mice to find how leprosy, an infection that has a preference for cooler areas of the body, would work in a warm-blooded animal. This mouse study helped further the understanding of how leprosy works in humans. This was called \"The Mouse Model.\" The main findings were that even in mice whose immune systems were severely impaired and at a perceived high risk of developing leprosy, the body was still, in most cases, able to fight off leprosy. The findings suggest that in mice, the body will use their body's energy to fight leprosy. Using The Mouse Model, Shepard was able to conduct new research regarding leprosy. This model can now be used as a tool to further study \"M. leprae\". The Mouse Model takes a more easily accessible animal model to better understand this complex disease. There are a few other up-and-coming models for \"M. leprae\", including the use of other animals, such as mammals, birds, and cold-blooded animals. These animals do not tend to give as great results as armadillos and mice, as different animals have different levels of disease resistance.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Bourbon kings first ruled France and Navarre in the 16th century. A branch descended from the French Bourbons came to rule Spain in the 18th century and is the current Spanish royal family. Other branches, descended from the Spanish Bourbons, held thrones in Naples, Sicily, and Parma. Today, Spain and Luxembourg have monarchs from the House of Bourbon.\nThe royal Bourbons originated in 1272, when Robert, the youngest son of King Louis IX of France, married the heiress of the lordship of Bourbon. The house continued for three centuries as a cadet branch, serving as nobles under the direct Capetian and Valois kings.\nThe senior line of the House of Bourbon became extinct in the male line in 1527 with the death of Duke Charles III of Bourbon. This made the junior Bourbon-Vend\u00f4me branch the genealogically senior branch of the House of Bourbon. In 1589, at the death of Henry III of France, the House of Valois became extinct in the male line. Under the Salic law, the head of the House of Bourbon, as the senior representative of the senior-surviving branch of the Capetian dynasty (first prince of the blood), became King of France as Henry IV. Bourbon monarchs then united to France the part of the Kingdom of Navarre north of the Pyrenees, which Henry's father had acquired by marriage in 1555, ruling both until the 1792 overthrow of the monarchy during the French Revolution. Restored briefly in 1814 and definitively in 1815 after the fall of the First French Empire, the senior line of the Bourbons was finally overthrown in the July Revolution of 1830. A cadet Bourbon branch, the House of Orl\u00e9ans, then ruled for 18 years (1830\u20131848), until it too was overthrown during the French Revolution of 1848.\nThe House of Cond\u00e9 was a cadet branch of the Bourbons descended from an uncle of Henry IV, and the House of Conti was a cadet line of the Cond\u00e9 branch. Both houses, recognized as princes of the blood, were prominent French noble families, well known for their participation in French affairs, even during exile in the French Revolution, until their respective extinctions in 1830 and 1814. Consequently, since the extinction of the Capetian House of Courtenay in 1733, the Bourbons are the only extant legitimate branch of the House of Capet. Although illegitimate, the House of Braganza traces its line to the House of Capet via descent from Robert II of France through the First House of Burgundy, then through the Portuguese House of Burgundy. Peter I of Portugal fathered an illegitimate son \u2013 John I of Portugal, founder of the House of Aviz \u2013 who in turn fathered an illegitimate son named Afonso, who in turn founded the extant House of Braganza.\nIn 1700, upon the death of King Charles II of Spain, the Spanish Habsburgs became extinct in the male line. Under the will of the childless Charles II, the second grandson of King Louis XIV of France was named as his successor, to preclude the union of the thrones of France and Spain. The prince, then Duke of Anjou, became Philip V of Spain. Permanent separation of the French and Spanish thrones was secured when France and Spain ratified Philip's renunciation, for himself and his descendants, of the French throne in the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, and similar arrangements later kept the Spanish throne separate from those of Naples, Sicily and Parma. The Spanish House of Bourbon (rendered in Spanish as \"Borb\u00f3n\" ) has been overthrown and restored several times, reigning 1700\u20131808, 1813\u20131868, 1875\u20131931, and since 1975. Bourbons ruled in Naples from 1734 to 1806 and in Sicily from 1735 to 1816, as well as in a unified Kingdom of the Two Sicilies from 1816 to 1861. They also ruled in Parma from 1731 to 1735, 1748 to 1802 and 1847 to 1859, in the Kingdom of Etruria from 1802 to 1807 and in the Duchy of Lucca from 1814 to 1847.\nGrand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg married Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma, and thus her successors, who have reigned in Luxembourg since her abdication in 1964, have also been members of the House of Bourbon. Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil, regent for her father, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, married a cadet of the Orl\u00e9ans line and thus their descendants, known as the Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza, were in the line of succession to the Brazilian throne and expected to ascend its throne had the monarchy not been abolished by a coup in 1889. All legitimate, living members of the House of Bourbon, including its cadet branches, are direct agnatic descendants of Henry IV through his son Louis XIII of France.\nOrigins.\nThe pre-Capetian House of Bourbon was a noble family, dating at least from the beginning of the 13th century, when the estate of Bourbon was ruled by the Sire de Bourbon who was a vassal of the King of France. The term House of Bourbon (\"Maison de Bourbon\") is sometimes used to refer to this and the House of Bourbon-Dampierre, the second family to rule the seigneury.\nIn 1272, Robert, Count of Clermont, sixth and youngest son of King Louis IX of France, married Beatrix of Bourbon, heiress to the lordship of Bourbon and member of the House of Bourbon-Dampierre. Their son Louis was made Duke of Bourbon in 1327. His descendant, the Constable of France Charles de Bourbon, was the last of the senior Bourbon line when he died in 1527. Because he chose to fight under the banner of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and lived in exile from France, his title was discontinued after his death.\nThe remaining line of Bourbons henceforth descended from James I, Count of La Marche, the younger son of Louis I, Duke of Bourbon. With the death of his grandson James II, Count of La Marche in 1438, the senior line of the Count of La Marche became extinct. All future Bourbons would descend from James II's younger brother, Louis, who became the Count of Vend\u00f4me through his mother's inheritance. In 1525, at the death of Charles IV, Duke of Alen\u00e7on, all of the princes of the blood royal were Bourbons; all remaining members of the House of Valois were members of the king's immediate family.\nIn 1514, Charles, Count of Vend\u00f4me had his title raised to Duke of Vend\u00f4me. His son Antoine became King of Navarre, on the northern side of the Pyrenees, by marriage in 1555. Two of Antoine's younger brothers were Cardinal Archbishop Charles de Bourbon and the French and Huguenot general Louis de Bourbon, 1st Prince of Cond\u00e9. Louis' male-line descendants, the Princes de Cond\u00e9, survived until 1830. Finally, in 1589, the House of Valois died out and Antoine's son Henry III of Navarre became Henry IV of France.\nList of Bourbons.\nBourbon branches.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFamily from India's claim to be a branch and their claim to The \"Throne of France\"\nAs per the latest research carried out by Prince Michael of Greece and incorporated in his historical novel, \"Le Rajah Bourbon\", Balthazar Napoleon IV de Bourbon from India is the senior heir in line to the French throne.\nFrance.\nRise of Henry IV.\nThe first Bourbon king of France was Henry IV. He was born on 13 December 1553 in the Kingdom of Navarre. Antoine de Bourbon, his father, was a ninth-generation descendant of King Louis IX of France. Jeanne d'Albret, his mother, was the Queen of Navarre and niece of King Francis I of France. He was baptized Catholic, but raised Calvinist. After his father was killed in 1562, he became Duke of Vend\u00f4me at the age of 10, with Admiral Gaspard de Coligny (1519\u20131572) as his regent. Seven years later, the young duke became the nominal leader of the Huguenots after the death of his uncle the Prince de Cond\u00e9 in 1569.\nHenry succeeded to Navarre as Henry III when his mother died in 1572. That same year Catherine de' Medici, mother of King Charles IX of France, arranged for the marriage of her daughter, Margaret of Valois, to Henry, ostensibly to advance peace between Catholics and Huguenots. Many Huguenots gathered in Paris for the wedding on 24 August, but were ambushed and slaughtered by Catholics in the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre. Henry saved his own life by converting to Catholicism. He repudiated his conversion in 1576 and resumed his leadership of the Huguenots.\nThe period from 1576 to 1584 was relatively calm in France, with the Huguenots consolidating control of much of the south with only occasional interference from the royal government. Extended civil war erupted again in 1584, when Fran\u00e7ois, Duke of Anjou, younger brother of King Henry III of France, died, leaving Navarre next in line for the throne. Thus began the War of the Three Henrys, as Henry of Navarre, Henry III, and the ultra-Catholic leader, Henry of Guise, fought a confusing three-cornered struggle for dominance. After Henry III was assassinated on 31 July 1589, Navarre claimed the throne as the first Bourbon king of France, Henry IV.\nMuch of Catholic France, organized into the Catholic League, refused to recognize a Protestant monarch and instead recognized Henry IV's uncle, Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon, as rightful king, and the civil war continued. Henry won a crucial victory at Ivry on 14 March 1590 and, following the death of the Cardinal the same year, the forces of the League lacked an obvious Catholic candidate for the throne and divided into various factions. Nevertheless, as a Protestant, Henry IV was unable to take Paris, a Catholic stronghold, or to decisively defeat his enemies, now supported by the Spanish. He reconverted to Catholicism in 1593 and was crowned king retroactively to 1589 at the Cathedral of Chartres on 27 February 1594.\nEarly Bourbons in France.\nHenry granted the Edict of Nantes on 13 April 1598, establishing Catholicism as an official state religion but also granting the Huguenots a measure of religious tolerance and political freedom short of full equality with the practice of Catholicism. This compromise ended the religious wars in France. That same year the Treaty of Vervins ended the war with Spain, adjusted the Spanish-French border, and resulted in a belated recognition by Spain of Henry as king of France.\nAbly assisted by Maximilien de B\u00e9thune, duc de Sully, Henry reduced the land tax known as the \"taille\"; promoted agriculture, public works, construction of highways, and the first French canal; started such important industries as the tapestry works of the Gobelins; and intervened in favor of Protestants in the duchies and earldoms along the German frontier. This last was to be the cause of his assassination.\nHenry's marriage to Margaret, which had produced no heir, was annulled in 1599, and he married Marie de' Medici, niece of the grand duke of Tuscany. A son, Louis, was born to them in 1601. Henry IV was assassinated on 14 May 1610 in Paris. Louis XIII was only nine years old when he succeeded his father. He was to prove a weak ruler; his reign was effectively a series of distinct regimes, depending who held the effective reins of power. At first, Marie de' Medici, his mother, served as regent and advanced a pro-Spanish policy. To deal with the financial troubles of France, Louis summoned the Estates General in 1614; this would be the last time that body met until the eve of the French Revolution. Marie arranged the 1615 marriage of Louis to Anne of Austria, the daughter of King Philip III of Spain.\nIn 1617, Louis conspired with Charles d'Albert, duc de Luynes to dispense with her influence, having her favorite Concino Concini assassinated on 26 April of that year. After some years of weak government by Louis's favorites, the King made Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu, a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of his mother, the chief minister of France in 1624.\nRichelieu advanced an anti-Habsburg policy. He arranged for Louis' sister, Henrietta Maria, to marry King Charles I of England, on 11 May 1625. Her pro-Catholic propaganda in England was one of the contributing factors to the English Civil War. Richelieu, as ambitious for France and the French monarchy as for himself, laid the ground for the absolute monarchy that would last in France until the Revolution. He wanted to establish a dominating position for France in Europe, and he wanted to unify France under the monarchy. He established the role of \"intendants\", non-noble men whose arbitrary powers of administration were granted (and revocable) by the monarch, superseding many of the traditional duties and privileges of the noble governors.\nAlthough it required a succession of internal military campaigns, he disarmed the fortified Huguenot towns that Henry had allowed. He involved France in the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648) against the Habsburgs by concluding an alliance with Sweden in 1631 and, actively, in 1635. He died in 1642 before the conclusion of that conflict, having groomed Cardinal Jules Mazarin as a successor. Louis XIII outlived him but by one year, dying in 1643 at the age of forty-two. After a childless marriage for twenty-three years his queen, Anne, delivered a son on 5 September 1638, whom he named Louis after himself. In the mid-18th century, the Bourbon monarchy had a faulty system for finance and taxation. Their lacking a national bank led to them taking short-term loans, and ordering financial agents to make payments in advance or in excess of tax revenues collected.\nLouis XIV and Louis XV.\nLouis XIV succeeded his father at four years of age; he would go on to become the most powerful king in French history. His mother Anne served as his regent with her favorite Jules, Cardinal Mazarin, as chief minister. When Louis was age 7, Nicolas de Neufville de Villeroy became governor of the young king. The main childhood places of Louis XIV were the Palais-Royal and the nearby H\u00f4tel de Villeroy. Mazarin continued the policies of Richelieu, bringing the Thirty Years' War to a successful conclusion in 1648 and defeating the nobility's challenge to royal absolutism in a series of civil wars known as the Frondes. He continued to war with Spain until 1659.\nIn that year the Treaty of the Pyrenees was signed signifying a major shift in power, France had replaced Spain as the dominant state in Europe. The treaty called for an arranged marriage between Louis and his cousin Maria Theresa, a daughter of King Philip IV of Spain by his first wife Elisabeth, the sister of Louis XIII. They were married in 1660 and had a son, Louis, in 1661. Mazarin died on 9 March 1661 and it was expected that Louis would appoint another chief minister, as had become the tradition, but instead he shocked the country by announcing he would rule alone.\nFor six years Louis reformed the finances of his state and built formidable armed forces. France fought a series of wars from 1667 onward and gained some territory on its northern and eastern borders. Maria Theresa died in 1683 and the next year he secretly married the devoutly Catholic Fran\u00e7oise d'Aubign\u00e9, Marquise de Maintenon. Louis XIV began to persecute Protestants, undoing the religious tolerance established by his grandfather Henry IV, culminating in his revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685.\nThe last war waged by Louis XIV proved to be one of the most important to dynastic Europe. In 1700, King Charles II of Spain, a Habsburg, died without a son. Louis's only legitimate son, the \"Grand Dauphin\", as the late king's nephew, was the closest heir; and Charles willed the kingdom to the Dauphin's second son, the Duke of Anjou. Other powers, particularly the Austrian Habsburgs, who had the next closest claims, objected to such a vast increase in French power.\nInitially, most of the other powers were willing to accept Anjou's reign as Philip V, but Louis's mishandling of their concerns soon drove the English, Dutch and other powers to join the Austrians in a coalition against France. The War of the Spanish Succession began in 1701 and raged for 12 years. In the end Louis's grandson was recognized as king of Spain, but he was obliged to agree to the forfeiture of succession rights in France, the Spanish Habsburgs' other European territories were largely ceded to Austria, and France was nearly bankrupted by the cost of the struggle. Louis died on 1 September 1715 ending his seventy-two-year reign, the longest in European history.\nThe reign of Louis XIV was so long that he outlived both his son and eldest grandson. He was succeeded by his great-grandson Louis XV. Louis XV was born on 15 February 1710 and was thus aged only five at his ascension, the third Louis in a row to become king of France before the age of thirteen (Louis XIII became king at 9, Louis XIV at almost 5 and himself at 5). Initially, the regency was held by Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, Louis XIV's nephew, as nearest adult male to the throne. This \"R\u00e9gence\" was seen as a period of greater individual expression, manifested in secular, artistic, literary and colonial activity, in contrast to the austere latter years of Louis XIV's reign.\nFollowing Orl\u00e9ans' death in 1723, the Duke of Bourbon, representative of the Bourbon-Cond\u00e9 cadet line, became prime minister. It was expected that Louis would marry his cousin, the daughter of King Philip V of Spain, but this engagement was broken by the duke in 1725 so that Louis could marry Marie Leszczy\u0144ska, the daughter of Stanislas, former king of Poland. Bourbon's motive appears to have been a desire to produce an heir as soon as possible so as to reduce the chances of a succession dispute between Philip V and the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans in the event of the sickly king's death. Maria was already an adult woman at the time of the marriage, while the infanta was still a young girl.\nNevertheless, Bourbon's action brought a very negative response from Spain, and for his incompetence Bourbon was soon replaced by Cardinal Andr\u00e9-Hercule de Fleury, the young king's tutor, in 1726. Fleury was a peace-loving man who intended to keep France out of war, but circumstances presented themselves that made this impossible. The first cause of these wars came in 1733 when Augustus II, the elector of Saxony and king of Poland died. With French support, Stanislas was again elected king. This brought France into conflict with Russia and Austria who supported Augustus III, Elector of Saxony and son of Augustus II.\nStanislas lost the Polish crown, but he was given the Duchy of Lorraine as compensation, which would pass to France after his death in 1766. Next came the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740 in which France supported King Frederick II of Prussia against Maria Theresa, Archduchess of Austria and Queen of Hungary. Fleury died in 1743 before the conclusion of the war.\nShortly after Fleury's death in 1745 Louis was influenced by his mistress the Marquise de Pompadour to reverse the policy of France in 1756 by creating an alliance with Austria against Prussia in the Seven Years' War. The war was a disaster for France, which lost most of her overseas possessions to the British in the Treaty of Paris (1763). Maria, his wife, died in 1768 and Louis himself died on 10 May 1774.\nFrench Revolution.\nLouis XVI had become the Dauphin of France upon the death of his father Louis, the son of Louis XV, in 1765. He married Marie Antoinette of Austria, a daughter of Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa, in 1770. Louis intervened in the American Revolution against Britain in 1778, but he is most remembered for his role in the French Revolution. France was in financial turmoil and Louis was forced to convene the Estates-General on 5 May 1789.\nThey formed the National Assembly and forced Louis to accept a constitution that limited his powers on 14 July 1789. He tried to flee France in June 1791, but was captured. The French monarchy was abolished on 21 September 1792 and a republic was proclaimed. The chain of Bourbon monarchs begun in 1589 was broken. Louis XVI was executed on 21 January 1793.\nMarie Antoinette and her son, Louis, were held as prisoners. Many French royalists proclaimed him Louis XVII, but he never reigned. She was executed on 16 October 1793. He died of tuberculosis on 8 June 1795 at the age of ten while in captivity.\nThe French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars spread nationalism and anti-absolutism throughout Europe, and the other Bourbon monarchs were threatened. Ferdinand IV was forced to flee from Naples in 1806 when Napoleon Bonaparte deposed him and installed his brother, Joseph, as king. Ferdinand continued to rule from Sicily until 1815.\nNapoleon conquered Parma in 1800 and compensated the Bourbon duke with Etruria, a new kingdom he created from the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. It was short-lived, counting only two monarchs, Louis and Louis II, as Napoleon annexed Etruria in 1807.\nKing Charles IV of Spain had been an ally of France. He succeeded his father, Charles III, in 1788. At first he declared war on France on 7 March 1793, but he made peace on 22 June 1795. This peace became an alliance on 19 August 1796. His chief minister, Manuel de Godoy convinced Charles that his son, Ferdinand, was plotting to overthrow him. Napoleon exploited the situation and invaded Spain in March 1808. This led to an uprising that forced Charles to abdicate on 19 March 1808 in favor of his son, who became Ferdinand VII. Napoleon forced Ferdinand to return the crown to Charles on 30 April and then convinced Charles to relinquish it to him on 10 May 1808. In turn, he gave it to his brother, Joseph, king of Naples on 6 June 1808. Joseph abandoned Naples to Joachim Murat, the husband of Napoleon's sister. This was very unpopular in Spain and resulted in the Peninsular War, a struggle that would contribute to the downfall of Napoleon.\nBourbon Restoration.\nWith the abdication of Napoleon on 11 April 1814 the Bourbon dynasty was restored to the Kingdom of France in the person of Louis XVIII, brother of Louis XVI. Napoleon escaped from exile and Louis fled in March 1815. Louis was again restored after the Battle of Waterloo on 7 July 1815.\nThe conservative elements of Europe dominated the post-Napoleonic age, but the values of the French Revolution could not be easily swept aside. Louis granted a constitution on 14 June 1814 to appease the liberals, but the ultra-royalist party, led by his brother, Charles, continued to influence his reign. When he died in 1824 his brother became king as Charles X much to the dismay of French liberals. In a saying ascribed to Talleyrand, \"they had learned nothing and forgotten nothing.\"\nAftermath.\nCharles passed several laws that appealed to the upper class but angered the middle class. The situation came to a head when he appointed a new minister on 8 August 1829 who did not have the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies. The chamber censured the king on 18 March 1830 and in response Charles proclaimed the July Ordinances on 26 July 1830 intended to silence criticism against him. This resulted in the July Revolution.\nAs a compromise the crown was offered to Louis Philippe, duke of Orl\u00e9ans, a descendant of the brother of Louis XIV, and the head of the Orl\u00e9anist cadet branch of the Bourbons. Agreeing to reign constitutionally and under the tricolour, he was proclaimed King of the French on 7 August 1830. The resulting regime, known as the July Monarchy, lasted until the Revolution of 1848. The Bourbon monarchy in France ended on 24 February 1848, when Louis Philippe was forced to abdicate and the short-lived Second Republic was established.\nSome Legitimists refused to recognize the Orl\u00e9anist monarchy. After the death of Charles in 1836 his son was proclaimed Louis XIX, though this title was never formally recognized. Charles' grandson Henri, Count of Chambord, the last Bourbon claimant of the French crown, was proclaimed by some Henry V, but the French monarchy was never restored.\nFollowing the 1870 collapse of the Second French Empire of Emperor Napoleon III, Henri was offered a restored throne. However Chambord refused to accept the throne unless France abandoned the revolution-inspired tricolour and accepted what he regarded as the true Bourbon flag of France, featuring the fleur-de-lis. The tricolour, originally associated with the French Revolution and the First Republic, had been used by the July Monarchy, the Second Republic and both Empires; the French National Assembly could not possibly agree.\nA \"temporary\" Third Republic was established, while monarchists waited for the comte de Chambord to die and for the succession to pass to Prince Philippe, Count of Paris, who was willing to accept the tricolour. Henri lived until 1883, by which time public opinion had come to accept the republic as the \"form of government that divides us least.\" His death without issue marked the extinction of the main line of the French Bourbons. Thus the head of the House of Bourbon became Juan, Count of Montiz\u00f3n of the Spanish line of the house who was also Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain, and had become the senior male of the dynasty by primogeniture. His heir as eldest Bourbon and head of the house is today Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou.\nHowever the terms of the Peace of Utrecht forbade the descendants of Philip V of Spain from inheriting the throne of France, therefore many monarchists recognised the Orl\u00e9ans line as heirs to the French throne.\nBy an ordinance of Louis Philippe I of 13 August 1830, it was decided that the king's children (and his sister) would continue to bear the arms of Orl\u00e9ans, that Louis-Philippe's eldest son, as Prince Royal, would bear the title of Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, that the younger sons would continue to have their existing titles, and that the sister and daughters of the king would be styled \"Royal Highness\" and \"d'Orl\u00e9ans,\" but the Orl\u00e9ans dynasts did not take the name \"of France.\"\nBourbons of Spain and Italy.\nPhilip V.\nThe Spanish branch of the House of Bourbon, also known as the House of Bourbon-Anjou, was founded by Philip V. He was born in 1683 at Versailles, the second son of the Grand Dauphin, who was eldest son of Louis XIV. He was Duke of Anjou and probably never expected to be raised to a rank higher than that. However, King Charles II of Spain, dying without issue, willed the throne to his grand-nephew the Duke of Anjou, who was the younger grandson of his eldest sister Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, who had married Louis XIV.\nThe prospect of Bourbons on both the French and Spanish thrones was resisted as creating an imbalance of power in Europe by its powers and, upon Charles II's death on 1 November 1700, a Grand Alliance of European nations united against Philip. This was known as the War of the Spanish Succession. In the Treaty of Utrecht, signed on 11 April 1713, Philip was recognized as king of Spain but his renunciation of succession rights to France was affirmed and, of the Spanish Empire's other European territories, Sicily was ceded to Savoy, and the Spanish Netherlands, Milan, and Naples were allotted to the Austrian Habsburgs.\nPhilip had two sons by his first wife. After her death, he married Elisabeth Farnese, niece of Francesco Farnese, Duke of Parma, in 1714. She presented Philip with three sons, for whom she had ambitions of securing Italian crowns. She therefore induced Philip to occupy Sardinia and Sicily in 1717.\nA Quadruple Alliance of Britain, France, Austria and the Netherlands was organized on 2 August 1718 to stop him. In the Treaty of The Hague, signed on 17 February 1720, Philip renounced his conquests of Sardinia and Sicily, but he assured the ascension of his eldest son by Elisabeth to the Duchy of Parma upon the reigning duke's death. Philip abdicated in January 1724 in favor of Louis I, his eldest son with his first wife, but Louis died in August and Philip resumed the crown.\nWhen the War of the Polish Succession began in 1733, Philip and Elisabeth saw another opportunity to advance the claims of their sons and recover at least part of the former possessions of the Spanish crown on the Italian peninsula. Philip signed the Family Compact with Louis XV, his nephew and king of France. Charles, Duke of Parma since 1731, invaded Naples. At the conclusion of peace on 13 November 1738, control of Parma and Piacenza was ceded to Austria, which had occupied the duchies but was now forced to recognise Charles as king of Naples and Sicily. Philip also used the War of the Austrian Succession to win back control of Parma. He did not live to see it to its conclusion, however, dying in 1746.\nFerdinand VI and Charles III.\nFerdinand VI, second son of Philip V and his first wife, succeeded his father. He was a peace-loving monarch who kept Spain out of the Seven Years' War. He died in 1759 in the midst of that conflict and was succeeded by his half-brother Charles III, already reigning as king in Naples and Sicily.\nFollowing Spain's victory over the Austrians at the Battle of Bitonto, it proved inexpedient to reunite Naples and Sicily to Spain, so as a compromise Charles became King of Naples, as Charles IV and VII of Sicily. Following Charles' accession to the Spanish throne in 1759, he was required, by the Treaty of Naples of 3 October 1759, to abdicate Naples and Sicily to his third son, Ferdinand, thus initiating the branch known as the Neapolitan Bourbons.\nCharles revived the Family Compact with France on 15 August 1761 and joined in the Seven Years' War against Britain in 1762; the reformist policies he had espoused in Naples were pursued with similar energy in Spain, where he completely overhauled the cumbersome bureaucracy of the state. As a French ally, he opposed Britain during the American Revolution in June 1779, supplying large quantities of weapons and munitions to the rebels and keeping one third of all the British forces in the Americas occupied defending Florida and what is now Alabama, which were ultimately recaptured by Spain. Charles died in 1788.\nBourbons of Parma.\nElisabeth Farnese's ambitions were realized at the conclusion of the War of the Austrian Succession in 1748 when the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza, already occupied by Spanish troops, were ceded by Austria to her second son, Philip, and combined with the former Duchy of Guastalla of the Gonzagas. Elisabeth died in 1766.\nLater Bourbon monarchs outside France.\nUpon the fall of the French Empire, Ferdinand I was restored to his throne in Naples, forming the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1816 and founding the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. His subjects revolted in 1820 and he was forced to grant a constitution; Austria invaded in March 1821 at his request and revoked the constitution. He was succeeded by his son, Francis I, in 1825 and by his grandson, Ferdinand II, in 1830. A revolution in Sicily erupted in January 1848 and Ferdinand was also forced to grant a constitution. This constitution was revoked in 1849. Ferdinand was succeeded by his son, Francis II, in May 1859.\nWhen Giuseppe Garibaldi captured Naples in 1860, Francis restored the constitution in an attempt to save his sovereignty. He fled to the fortress of Gaeta, which was besieged and captured by the Piedmontese troops in February 1861. His kingdom was incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy on 17 March 1861, after the fall the fortress of Messina (surrendered on 12 March), although the Neapolitan troops in Civitella del Tronto resisted three days longer.\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, Napoleon's wife, Maria Louisa, was made Duchess of Parma. As compensation, Charles Louis, the former king of Etruria, was made the Duke of Lucca. When Maria Louisa died in 1847 he was restored to Parma as Charles II. Lucca was incorporated into Tuscany. He was succeeded by his son, Charles III, and grandson, Robert I, in 1854. The people of Parma voted for a union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. After Italian unification the next year, the Bourbon dynasty in Italy was no more.\nFerdinand VII was restored to the throne of Spain in March 1814. Like his Italian Bourbon counterpart, his subjects revolted against him in January 1820 and he was forced to grant a constitution. A French army invaded in 1823 and the constitution was revoked. Ferdinand married his fourth wife, Maria Christina, the daughter of Francis I, the Bourbon king of the Two Sicilies, in 1829. Despite his many marriages he did not have a son, so in 1833 he was influenced by his wife to abolish the Salic Law so that their daughter, Isabella, could become queen depriving his brother, Don Carlos, of the throne.\nIsabella II succeeded her father when he died in 1833. She was only three years old and Maria Cristina, her mother, served as regent. Maria knew that she needed the support of the liberals to oppose Don Carlos so she granted a constitution in 1834. Don Carlos found his greatest support in Catalonia and the Basque country because the constitution centralized the provinces thus denying them the autonomy they sought. He was defeated and fled the country in 1839. Isabella was declared of age in 1843 and she married her cousin Francisco de As\u00eds, the son of her father's brother, on 10 October 1846. A military revolution broke out against Isabella in 1868 and she was deposed on 29 September 1868. She abdicated in favor of her son, Alfonso, in 1870, but Spain was proclaimed a republic for a brief time.\nWhen the First Spanish Republic failed, the crown was offered to Isabella's son, who accepted on 1 January 1875 as Alfonso XII. The Carlist pretender, Don Carlos, who returned to Spain, was defeated and resumed his exile in February 1876. Alfonso granted a new constitution in July 1876 that was more liberal than the one granted by his grandmother. His reign was cut short when he died in 1885 at the age of twenty-eight.\nAlfonso XIII was born on 17 May 1886, after the death of his father. His mother, Maria Christina, the second wife of Alfonso XII, served as regent. Alfonso XIII was declared of age in 1902, and he married Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg, the granddaughter of the British Queen Victoria, on 31 May 1906. He remained neutral during World War I, but he supported the military coup of Miguel Primo de Rivera on 13 September 1923. A movement towards the establishment of a republic began in 1930, and Alfonso fled the country on 14 April 1931. He never formally abdicated, but he lived the rest of his life in exile and died in 1941.\nThe Bourbon dynasty seemed finished in Spain as in the rest of the world, but it would be resurrected. The Second Spanish Republic was overthrown in the Spanish Civil War, leading to the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. He named Juan Carlos de Borb\u00f3n, a grandson of Alfonso XIII, his successor in 1969. When Franco died six years later, Juan Carlos I took the throne to restore the Bourbon dynasty. The new king oversaw the Spanish transition to democracy, and the Spanish Constitution of 1978 recognized the monarchy.\nSince 1964, the Bourbon-Parma line has reigned agnatically (although not officially) in Luxembourg through Grand Dukes Jean and his son Henri. In June 2011, Luxembourg adopted absolute primogeniture, replacing the old Semi-Salic law that might have guaranteed the survival of Bourbon rule for generations. Although it is not as powerful as it once was and no longer reigns in its native country of France, the House of Bourbon is by no means extinct and has survived to the present-day world, predominantly composed of republics.\nThe House of Bourbon, in its surviving branches, is believed to be the oldest royal dynasty of Europe (and the oldest documented European family altogether) that is still existing in the direct male line today. The House of Capet's male ancestors, the Robertians, go back to Robert of Hesbaye (d. 807) as their first secured ancestor, and he is believed to be a direct male descendant of Charibert de Haspengau (c. 555\u2013636). Should this be true, only the Imperial House of Japan would outmatch the Bourbon's age, being reliably documented \u2013 as a ruling house already \u2013 from about 540. The House of Hesse traces its line back to 841, the House of Welf-Este and the House of Wettin were both emerging in the 10th century, and so were some Italian non-ruling houses like the Caetani or the Massimo family, whereas most of the other ruling families of Europe only turned up to the light of history after the year 1000.\nList of Bourbon rulers.\nFrance.\nMonarchs of France and Navarre.\nDates indicate reigns, not lifetimes:\nClaimants to the throne of France.\nDates indicate claims, not lifetimes:\nMonarchs of France.\nDates indicate reigns, not lifetimes:\nLegitimist claimants in France.\nDates indicate claims, not lifetimes:\nLegitimist claimants in France (Spanish branch).\nDates indicate claims, not lifetimes:\nOrl\u00e9anist and Unionist claimants in France.\nDates indicate claims, not lifetimes:\nKingdom of Spain.\nMonarchs of Spain.\nDates indicate seniority, not lifetimes.

A prince with the rank of (Son of France) is surnamed \"de France\"; all the male-line descendants of each , however, took his main title (whether an appanage or a courtesy title) as their family or last name. However, when Louis XVI was put on trial and later \"guillotined\" (executed) by the revolutionaries National Convention in France in 1793, they somewhat contemptuously referred to him in written documents and spoken address as \"Citizen Louis Capet\" as if a \"commoner\" (referring back to the Medieval origins of the Bourbon Dynasty's name and referring to Hugh Capet, founder of the Capetian dynasty).\nMembers of the House of Bourbon-Cond\u00e9 and its cadet branches, which never ascended to the throne, used the surname \"de Bourbon\" until their extinction in 1830.\nThe daughters of Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, were the first members of the House of Bourbon since the accession of Henry IV to take their surname from the appanage of their father (d'Orl\u00e9ans). Gaston died without a male heir; his titles reverted to the crown. It was given to his nephew, Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, brother of Louis XIV, whose descendants still bear the surname.\nWhen Philippe, grandson of Louis XIV, became King of Spain as Philip V, he gave up his French titles. As a Son of France, his actual surname was \"de France\". However, since that surname was not heritable for descendants of rank lower than Son of France, and since Philippe had already given up his French titles, his descendants simply took the name of their royal house as their surname (\"de Bourbon\", rendered in Spanish as \"\").\nThe children of Philippe's brother, Charles, Duke of Berry (all of whom died in infancy), were given the surname \"d'Alen\u00e7on\". He was Duke of Berry only in name, so the surname of his children was taken from his first substantial duchy.\nThe children of Charles Philippe, Count of Artois, brother of Louis XVI, were surnamed \"d'Artois\". When Charles succeeded to the throne as Charles X, his son Louis Antoine became a Son of France, with the corresponding change in surname. His grandson, Henri d'Artois, being merely a Grandson of France, would use the surname until his death.\nCapetian related branches.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe three dynasties of Bourbon.\nThe first were the lords of Bourbon, who died out by the males in 1171, then by the women in 1216. Their coat of arms are: D'or au lion de gueules, et \u00e0 l'orle de huit coquilles d'azur Nicolas Louis Achaintre, \"Genealogical and chronological history of the royal house of Bourbon\", vol. 1, \u00e9d. Didot, 1825, p.\u00a045.\nThe second family formed by the marriage of the last descendant of the first family, Mathilde of Bourbon with Guy II of Dampierre, this land passed to the house of Dampierre in 1196. The coat of arms of this family is: \"De gueules \u00e0 deux l\u00e9opards d'or, avec couronne de baron\", but they took the coat of arms of the previous ones. The son of Guy de Dampierre and Mahaut de Bourbon, Archambaud VIII, took the name and arms of his mother, \"de Bourbon\", the House of Bourbon-Dampierre. By the marriage of, Agnes of Dampierre (died around 1287), with John of Burgundy, this important lordship passed to their daughter B\u00e9atrice de Bourgogne (1257\u20131310), lady of Bourbon, then to her husband Robert, Count of Clermont (1256\u20131317), and penultimate child of Saint Louis, thus possessing the land of Bourbon by \"the right of the woman (\"de iure uxoris\").\nThe third house of Bourbon acceded to the throne of Navarre in 1555, then to the throne of France in 1589 by Henri IV. His coat of arms are: \"D'azur, fleurs-de-lys d'or sans nombre, l'\u00e9cu bris\u00e9 d'un b\u00e2ton ou cotice de gueules, brochant sur le tout, avec couronne de fils de France. The name \"House of Bourbon\" was then used to describe the entire House of France, officially since 29 June 1768, date of death of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Courtenay (1689\u20131768), with which was

{"id": "44706", "revid": "69412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44706", "title": "Genre", "text": "Category of creative works based on stylistic and/or thematic criteria\nGenre () is any style or form of communication in any mode (written, spoken, digital, artistic, etc.) with socially agreed-upon conventions developed over time. In popular usage, it normally describes a category of literature, music, or other forms of art or entertainment, based on some set of stylistic criteria, as in literary genres, film genres, music genres, comics genres, etc. Often, works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions. Stand-alone texts, works, or pieces of communication may have individual styles, but genres are amalgams of these texts based on agreed-upon or socially inferred conventions. Some genres may have rigid, strictly adhered-to guidelines, while others may show great flexibility. The proper use of a specific genre is important for a successful transfer of information (media-adequacy).\nCritical discussion of genre perhaps began with a classification system for ancient Greek literature, as set out in Aristotle's \"Poetics\". For Aristotle, poetry (odes, epics, etc.), prose, and performance each had specific features that supported appropriate content of each genre. Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy, for example, and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best.\nThe academic discipline about genres is called \"genre studies\" (or \"genre theory\").\nGenres proliferate and develop beyond Aristotle's classifications\u2014 in response to changes in audiences and creators. Genre has become a dynamic tool to help the public make sense out of unpredictability through artistic expression. Given that art is often a response to a social state, in that people write, paint, sing, dance, and otherwise produce art about what they know about, the use of genre as a tool must be able to adapt to changing meanings.\nVisual arts.\nThe term \"genre\" is often used in the history and criticism of visual art, but in art history has meanings that overlap rather confusingly. Genre painting is a term for paintings where the main subject features human figures to whom no specific identity attaches\u00a0\u2013 in other words, figures are not portraits, characters from a story, or allegorical personifications. They usually deal with subjects drawn from \"everyday life\". These are distinguished from staffage: incidental figures in what is primarily a landscape or architectural painting. \"Genre\" is also be used to refer to specialized types of art such as still-life, landscapes, marine paintings and animal paintings, or groups of artworks with other particular features in terms of subject-matter, style or iconography.\nThe concept of the \"hierarchy of genres\" was a powerful one in artistic theory, especially between the 17th and 19th centuries. It was strongest in France, where it was associated with the which held a central role in academic art. The genres, which were mainly applied to painting, in hierarchical order are:\nThe hierarchy was based on a distinction between art that made an intellectual effort to \"render visible the universal essence of things\" (\"imitare\" in Italian) and that which merely consisted of \"mechanical copying of particular appearances\" (\"ritrarre\"). Idealism was privileged over realism in line with Renaissance Neo-Platonist philosophy.\nLiterature.\nA literary \"genre\" is a category of literary composition. Genres may be determined by literary technique, tone, content, or even (as in the case of fiction) length. Genre should not be confused with age category, by which literature may be classified as either adult, young adult, or children's. They also must not be confused with format, such as graphic novel or picture book. The distinctions between genres and categories are flexible and loosely defined, often with subgroups.\nThe most general genres in literature are (in loose chronological order) epic, tragedy, comedy, novel, and short story. They can all be in the genres prose or poetry, which shows best how loosely genres are defined. Additionally, a genre such as satire might appear in any of the above, not only as a subgenre but as a mixture of genres. Finally, they are defined by the general cultural movement of the historical period in which they were composed. In popular fiction, which is especially divided by genres, genre fiction is the more usual term.\nIn literature, genre has been known as an intangible taxonomy. This taxonomy implies a concept of containment or that an idea will be stable forever. The earliest recorded systems of genre in Western history can be traced back to Plato and Aristotle. G\u00e9rard Genette, a French literary theorist and author of \"The Architext\", describes Plato as creating three Imitational genres: dramatic dialogue, pure narrative, and epic (a mixture of dialogue and narrative). Lyric poetry, the fourth and final type of Greek literature, was excluded by Plato as a non-mimetic mode. Aristotle later revised Plato's system by eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode and distinguishing by two additional criteria: the object to be imitated, as objects could be either superior or inferior, and the medium of presentation such as words, gestures or verse. Essentially, the three categories of mode, object, and medium dialogue, epic (superior-mixed narrative), comedy (inferior-dramatic dialogue), and parody (inferior-mixed narrative). \nGenette continues by explaining the later integration of lyric poetry into the classical system during the romantic period, replacing the now removed pure narrative mode. Lyric poetry, once considered non-mimetic, was deemed to imitate feelings, becoming the third leg of a new tripartite system: lyrical, epical, and dramatic dialogue. This system, which came to \"dominate all the literary theory of German romanticism (and therefore well beyond)\u2026\" (38), has seen numerous attempts at expansion or revision. However, more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing scope and complexity.\nGenette reflects upon these various systems, comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement: \"its structure is somewhat superior to\u2026those that have come after, fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy, which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse\" (74). Taxonomy allows for a structured classification system of genre, as opposed to a more contemporary rhetorical model of genre.\nFilm.\nThe basic genres of film can be regarded as drama, in the feature film and most cartoons, and documentary. Most dramatic feature films, especially from Hollywood fall fairly comfortably into one of a long list of film genres such as the Western, war film, horror film, romantic comedy film, musical, crime film, and many others. Many of these genres have a number of subgenres, for example by setting or subject, or a distinctive national style, for example in the Indian Bollywood musical.\nMusic.\nA music genre is a conventional category that identifies pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from \"musical form\" and \"musical style\", although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. There are numerous genres in Western classical music and popular music, as well as musical theatre and the music of non-Western cultures. The term is now perhaps over-used to describe relatively small differences in musical style in modern rock music, that also may reflect sociological differences in their audiences. Timothy Laurie suggests that in the context of rock and pop music studies, the \"appeal of genre criticism is that it makes narratives out of musical worlds that often seem to lack them\".\nMusic can be divided into different genres in several ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often arbitrary and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are several academic approaches to genres. In his book \"Form in Tonal Music\", Douglass M. Green lists madrigal, motet, canzona, ricercar, and dance as examples of genres from the Renaissance period. According to Green, \"Beethoven's \"Op. 61\" and Mendelssohn's \"Op. 64\" are identical in genre\u00a0\u2013 both are violin concertos\u00a0\u2013 but different in form. However, Mozart's \"Rondo for Piano, K. 511\", and the \"Agnus Dei\" from his \"Mass, K. 317\" are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.\" Some, like Peter van der Merwe, treat the terms \"genre\" and \"style\" as the same, saying that \"genre\" should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or \"basic musical language\".\nOthers, such as Allan F. Moore, state that \"genre\" and \"style\" are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres. A music genre or subgenre may be defined by the musical techniques, the styles, the context, and content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres.\nSeveral music scholars have criticized the priority accorded to genre-based communities and listening practices. For example, Laurie argues that \"music genres do not belong to isolated, self-sufficient communities. People constantly move between environments where diverse forms of music are heard, advertised and accessorised with distinctive iconographies, narratives and celebrity identities that also touch on non-musical worlds.\"\nPopular culture and other media.\nThe concept of genre is often applied, sometimes rather loosely, to other media with an artistic element, such as video game genres. Genre, and numerous minutely divided subgenres, affect popular culture very significantly, not least as they are used to classify it for publicity purposes. The vastly increased output of popular culture in the age of electronic media encourages dividing cultural products by genre to simplify the search for products by consumers, a trend the Internet has only intensified.\nLinguistics.\nIn philosophy of language, genre figures prominently in the works of philosopher and literary scholar Mikhail Bakhtin. Bakhtin's basic observations were of \"speech genres\" (the idea of heteroglossia), modes of speaking or writing that people learn to mimic, weave together, and manipulate (such as \"formal letter\" and \"grocery list\", or \"university lecture\" and \"personal anecdote\"). In this sense, genres are socially specified: recognized and defined (often informally) by a particular culture or community. The work of Georg Luk\u00e1cs also touches on the nature of literary genres, appearing separately but around the same time (1920s\u20131930s) as Bakhtin. Norman Fairclough has a similar concept of genre that emphasizes the social context of the text: Genres are \"different ways of (inter)acting discoursally\" (Fairclough, 2003: 26).\nA text's genre may be determined by its:\nRhetoric.\nIn the field of rhetoric, genre theorists usually understand genres as types of actions rather than types or forms of texts. On this perspective, texts are channels through which genres are enacted. Carolyn Miller's work has been especially important for this perspective. Drawing on Lloyd Bitzer's concept of rhetorical situation, Miller reasons that recurring rhetorical problems tend to elicit recurring responses; drawing on Alfred Sch\u00fctz, she reasons that these recurring responses become \"typified\" \u2013 that is, socially constructed as recognizable types. Miller argues that these \"typified rhetorical actions\" (p.\u00a0151) are properly understood as genres.\nBuilding off of Miller, Charles Bazerman and Clay Spinuzzi have argued that genres understood as actions derive their meaning from other genres \u2013 that is, other actions. Bazerman therefore proposes that we analyze genres in terms of \"genre systems\", while Spinuzzi prefers the closely related concept of \"genre ecologies\". Reiff and Bawarshi define genre analysis as a critical reading of people's patterns of communication in different situations.\nThis tradition has had implications for the teaching of writing in American colleges and universities. Combining rhetorical genre theory with activity theory, David Russell has proposed that standard English composition courses are ill-suited to teach the genres that students will write in other contexts across the university and beyond. Elizabeth Wardle contends that standard composition courses do teach genres, but that these are inauthentic \"mutt genres\" that are often of little use outside composition courses.\nGenre is effective as a tool in rhetoric because it allows a speaker to set the context for a rhetorical discussion. Devitt, Reiff, and Bawarshi suggest that rhetorical genres may be assigned based on careful analysis of the subject matter and consideration of the audience.\nGenre is related to Ludwig Wittgenstein's theory of Family resemblance in which he describes how genres act like a family tree, where members of a family are related, but not exact copies of one another.\nHistory.\nThis concept of genre originated from the classification systems created by Plato. Plato divided literature into the three classic genres accepted in Ancient Greece: poetry, drama, and prose. Poetry is further subdivided into epic, lyric, and drama. The divisions are recognized as being set by Aristotle and Plato; however, they were not the only ones. Many genre theorists added to these accepted forms of poetry.\nClassical and Romance genre theory.\nThe earliest recorded systems of genre in Western history can be traced back to Plato and Aristotle. G\u00e9rard Genette explains his interpretation of the history of genre in \"The Architext\". He described Plato as the creator of three imitational, mimetic genres distinguished by mode of imitation rather than content. These three imitational genres include dramatic dialogue, the drama; pure narrative, the dithyramb; and a mixture of the two, the epic. Plato excluded lyric poetry as a non-mimetic, imitational mode. Genette further discussed how Aristotle revised Plato's system by first eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode. He then uses two additional criteria to distinguish the system. The first of the criteria is the object to be imitated, whether superior or inferior. The second criterion is the medium of presentation: words, gestures, or verse. Essentially, the three categories of mode, object, and medium can be visualized along an XYZ axis. Excluding the criteria of medium, Aristotle's system distinguished four types of classical genres: tragedy, epic, comedy, and parody.\nGenette explained the integration of lyric poetry into the classical system by replacing the removed pure narrative mode. Lyric poetry, once considered non-mimetic, was deemed to imitate feelings, becoming the third \"Architext\", a term coined by Gennette, of a new long-enduring tripartite system: lyrical; epical, the mixed narrative; and dramatic, the dialogue. This new system that came to \"dominate all the literary theory of German romanticism\" (Genette 38) has seen numerous attempts at expansion and revision. Such attempts include Friedrich Schlegel's triad of subjective form, the lyric; objective form, the dramatic; and subjective-objective form, the epic. However, more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing complexity. Gennette reflected upon these various systems, comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement: \"its structure is somewhat superior to most of those that have come after, fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy, which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse\".\nAudiences.\nAlthough genres are not always precisely definable, genre considerations are one of the most important factors in determining what a person will see or read. The classification properties of genre can attract or repel potential users depending on the individual's understanding of a genre.\nGenre creates an expectation in that expectation is met or not. Many genres have built-in audiences and corresponding publications that support them, such as magazines and websites. Inversely, audiences may call out for change in an antecedent genre and create an entirely new genre.\nThe term may be used in categorizing web pages, like \"news page\" and \"fan page\", with both very different layout, audience, and intention (Rosso, 2008). Some search engines like Viv\u00edsimo try to group found web pages into automated categories in an attempt to show various genres the search hits might fit.\nSubgenre.\nA subgenre is a subordinate within a genre, Two stories being the same genre can still sometimes differ in subgenre. For example, if a fantasy story has darker and more frightening elements of fantasy, it would belong in the subgenre of dark fantasy; whereas another fantasy story that features magic swords and wizards would belong to the subgenre of sword and sorcery.\nMicrogenre.\nA microgenre is a highly specialized, narrow classification of a cultural practice. The term has come into usage in the 21st century, and most commonly refers to music. It is also associated with the hyper-specific categories used in recommendations for television shows and movies on digital streaming platforms such as Netflix, and is sometimes used more broadly by scholars analyzing niche forms in other periods and other media.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This polarization can be reversed when an external electric field is applied.\nAll ferroelectric materials are also piezoelectric (they generate an electric charge when mechanically stressed) and pyroelectric (they generate a charge when heated or cooled). Their distinctive feature is that the natural electrical polarization is reversible.\nThe term ferroelectricity was coined in analogy to ferromagnetism, where a material exhibits a permanent magnetic moment. Ferromagnetism was already well established when ferroelectricity was first observed in 1920 in Rochelle salt by American physicist Joseph Valasek. The prefix ferro (meaning iron) was adopted even though most ferroelectric materials do not contain iron.\nMaterials that are both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic are known as multiferroics, and they are of particular interest because they combine electric and magnetic ordering in a single system.\nPolarization.\nWhen most materials are electrically polarized, the induced polarization \"P\", is almost exactly proportional to the applied external electric field \"E\"; so the polarization is a linear function. This is called linear dielectric polarization (see figure). Some materials, known as paraelectric materials, show a more enhanced nonlinear polarization (see figure). The electric permittivity, corresponding to the slope of the polarization curve, is not constant as in linear dielectrics but is a function of the external electric field.\nIn addition to being nonlinear, ferroelectric materials demonstrate a spontaneous nonzero polarization (after entrainment, see figure) even when the applied field \"E\" is zero. The distinguishing feature of ferroelectrics is that the spontaneous polarization can be \"reversed\" by a suitably strong applied electric field in the opposite direction; the polarization is therefore dependent not only on the current electric field but also on its history, yielding a hysteresis loop. They are called ferroelectrics by analogy to ferromagnetic materials, which have spontaneous magnetization and exhibit similar hysteresis loops.\nTypically, materials demonstrate ferroelectricity only below a certain phase transition temperature, called the Curie temperature (\"T\"C) and are paraelectric above this temperature: the spontaneous polarization vanishes, and the ferroelectric crystal transforms into the paraelectric state. Many ferroelectrics lose their pyroelectric properties above \"T\"C completely, because their paraelectric phase has a centrosymmetric crystal structure.\nApplications.\nThe nonlinear nature of ferroelectric materials can be used to make capacitors with adjustable capacitance. Typically, a ferroelectric capacitor simply consists of a pair of electrodes sandwiching a layer of ferroelectric material. The permittivity of ferroelectrics is not only adjustable but commonly also very high, especially when close to the phase transition temperature. Because of this, ferroelectric capacitors are small in physical size compared to dielectric (non-tunable) capacitors of similar capacitance.\nThe spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric materials implies a hysteresis effect which can be used as a memory function, and ferroelectric capacitors are indeed used to make ferroelectric RAM for computers and RFID cards. In these applications thin films of ferroelectric materials are typically used, as this allows the field required to switch the polarization to be achieved with a moderate voltage. However, when using thin films a great deal of attention needs to be paid to the interfaces, electrodes and sample quality for devices to work reliably.\nFerroelectric materials are required by symmetry considerations to also be piezoelectric and pyroelectric. The combined properties of memory, piezoelectricity, and pyroelectricity make ferroelectric capacitors very useful, e.g. for sensor applications. Ferroelectric capacitors are used in medical ultrasound machines (the capacitors generate and then listen for the ultrasound ping used to image the internal organs of a body), high quality infrared cameras (the infrared image is projected onto a two dimensional array of ferroelectric capacitors capable of detecting temperature differences as small as millionths of a degree Celsius), fire sensors, sonar, vibration sensors, and even fuel injectors on diesel engines.\nAnother idea of recent interest is the \"ferroelectric tunnel junction\" (\"FTJ\") in which a contact is made up by nanometer-thick ferroelectric film placed between metal electrodes. The thickness of the ferroelectric layer is small enough to allow tunneling of electrons. The piezoelectric and interface effects as well as the depolarization field may lead to a giant electroresistance (GER) switching effect.\nYet another burgeoning application is multiferroics, where researchers are looking for ways to couple magnetic and ferroelectric ordering within a material or heterostructure; there are several recent reviews on this topic.\nCatalytic properties of ferroelectrics have been studied since 1952 when Parravano observed anomalies in CO oxidation rates over ferroelectric sodium and potassium niobates near the Curie temperature of these materials. Surface-perpendicular component of the ferroelectric polarization can dope polarization-dependent charges on surfaces of ferroelectric materials, changing their chemistry. This opens the possibility of performing catalysis beyond the limits of the Sabatier principle. Sabatier principle states that the surface-adsorbates interaction has to be an optimal amount: not too weak to be inert toward the reactants and not too strong to poison the surface and avoid desorption of the products: a compromise situation. This set of optimum interactions is usually referred to as \"top of the volcano\" in activity volcano plots. On the other hand, ferroelectric polarization-dependent chemistry can offer the possibility of switching the surface\u2014adsorbates interaction from strong adsorption to strong desorption, thus a compromise between desorption and adsorption is no longer needed. Ferroelectric polarization can also act as an energy harvester. Polarization can help the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, leading to enhanced photocatalysis. Also, due to pyroelectric and piezoelectric effects under varying temperature (heating/cooling cycles) or varying strain (vibrations) conditions extra charges can appear on the surface and drive various (electro)chemical reactions forward.\nPhotoferroelectric imaging is a technique to record optical information on pieces of ferroelectric material. The images are nonvolatile and selectively erasable.\nMaterials.\nThe internal electric dipoles of a ferroelectric material are coupled to the material lattice so anything that changes the lattice will change the strength of the dipoles (in other words, a change in the spontaneous polarization). The change in the spontaneous polarization results in a change in the surface charge. This can cause current flow in the case of a ferroelectric capacitor even without the presence of an external voltage across the capacitor. Two stimuli that will change the lattice dimensions of a material are force and temperature. The generation of a surface charge in response to the application of an external stress to a material is called piezoelectricity. A change in the spontaneous polarization of a material in response to a change in temperature is called pyroelectricity.\nGenerally, there are 230 space groups among which 32 crystalline classes can be found in crystals. There are 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, within which 20 are piezoelectric. Among the piezoelectric classes, 10 have a spontaneous electric polarization which varies with temperature; thus they are pyroelectric. Ferroelectricity is a subset of pyroelectricity, which brings spontaneous electronic polarization to the material.\nFerroelectric phase transitions are often characterized as either displacive (such as BaTiO3) or order-disorder (such as NaNO2), though often phase transitions will demonstrate elements of both behaviors. In barium titanate, a typical ferroelectric of the displacive type, the transition can be understood in terms of a polarization catastrophe, in which, if an ion is displaced from equilibrium slightly, the force from the local electric fields due to the ions in the crystal increases faster than the elastic-restoring forces. This leads to an asymmetrical shift in the equilibrium ion positions and hence to a permanent dipole moment. The ionic displacement in barium titanate concerns the relative position of the titanium ion within the oxygen octahedral cage. In lead titanate, another key ferroelectric material, although the structure is rather similar to barium titanate the driving force for ferroelectricity is more complex with interactions between the lead and oxygen ions also playing an important role. In an order-disorder ferroelectric, there is a dipole moment in each unit cell, but at high temperatures they are pointing in random directions. Upon lowering the temperature and going through the phase transition, the dipoles order, all pointing in the same direction within a domain.\nAn important ferroelectric material for applications is lead zirconate titanate (PZT), which is part of the solid solution formed between ferroelectric lead titanate and anti-ferroelectric lead zirconate. Different compositions are used for different applications; for memory applications, PZT closer in composition to lead titanate is preferred, whereas piezoelectric applications make use of the diverging piezoelectric coefficients associated with the morphotropic phase boundary that is found close to the 50/50 composition.\nFerroelectric crystals often show several transition temperatures and domain structure hysteresis, much as do ferromagnetic crystals. The nature of the phase transition in some ferroelectric crystals is still not well understood.\nIn 1974 R.B. Meyer used symmetry arguments to predict ferroelectric liquid crystals, and the prediction could immediately be verified by several observations of behavior connected to ferroelectricity in smectic liquid-crystal phases that are chiral and tilted. The technology allows the building of flat-screen monitors. Mass production between 1994 and 1999 was carried out by Canon. Ferroelectric liquid crystals are used in production of reflective LCoS.\nIn 2010 David Field found that prosaic films of chemicals such as nitrous oxide or propane exhibited ferroelectric properties. This new class of ferroelectric materials exhibit \"spontelectric\" properties, and may have wide-ranging applications in device and nano-technology and also influence the electrical nature of dust in the interstellar medium.\nOther ferroelectric materials used include triglycine sulfate, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and lithium tantalate. A single atom thick ferroelectric monolayer can be created using pure bismuth.\nIt should be possible to produce materials which combine both ferroelectric and metallic properties simultaneously, at room temperature. According to research published in 2018 in \"Nature Communications\", scientists were able to produce a two-dimensional sheet of material which was both ferroelectric (had a polar crystal structure) and which conducted electricity.\nTheory.\nAn introduction to Landau theory can be found here.\nBased on Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory, the free energy of a ferroelectric material, in the absence of an electric field and applied stress may be written as a Taylor expansion in terms of the order parameter, P. If a sixth order expansion is used (i.e. 8th order and higher terms truncated), the free energy is given by:\nformula_1\nwhere \"Px\", \"Py\", \"Pz\" are the components of the polarization vector in the \"x\", \"y\", \"z\" directions respectively, and the coefficients, \"\u03b1i\", \"\u03b1ij\", \"\u03b1ijk\" must be consistent with the crystal symmetry. To investigate domain formation and other phenomena in ferroelectrics, these equations are often used in the context of a phase field model. Typically, this involves adding a gradient term, an electrostatic term and an elastic term to the free energy. The equations are then discretized onto a grid using the finite difference method or finite element method and solved subject to the constraints of Gauss's law and Linear elasticity.\nIn all known ferroelectrics, \"\u03b1\"0 &gt; 0 and \"\u03b1\"111 &gt; 0. These coefficients may be obtained experimentally or from ab-initio simulations. For ferroelectrics with a first order phase transition, \"\u03b1\"11 &lt; 0, whereas \"\u03b1\"11 &gt; 0 for a second order phase transition.\nThe \"spontaneous polarization\", Ps of a ferroelectric for a cubic to tetragonal phase transition may be obtained by considering the 1D expression of the free energy which is:\nformula_2\nThis free energy has the shape of a double well potential with two free energy minima at \"Px\" = \"Ps\", the spontaneous polarization. We find the derivative of the free energy, and set it equal to zero in order to solve for Ps:\nformula_3\nSince the \"Ps\" = 0 solution of this equation rather corresponds to a free energy \"maxima\" in the ferroelectric phase, the desired solutions for Ps correspond to setting the remaining factor to zero:\nformula_4\nwhose solution is:\nformula_5\nand eliminating solutions which take the square root of a negative number (for either the first or second order phase transitions) gives:\nformula_6\nIf formula_7, the solution for the spontaneous polarization reduces to:\nformula_8\nThe hysteresis loop (Px versus Ex) may be obtained from the free energy expansion by including the term \u2212ExPx corresponding to the energy due to an external electric field Ex interacting with the polarization Px, as follows:\nformula_9\nWe find the stable polarization values of Px under the influence of the external field, now denoted as Pe, again by setting the derivative of the energy with respect to Px to zero:\nformula_10\nPlotting Ex (on the X axis) as a function of Pe (but on the Y axis) gives an S-shaped curve which is multi-valued in Pe for some values of Ex. The central part of the 'S' corresponds to a free energy local maximum (since formula_11 ). Elimination of this region, and connection of the top and bottom portions of the 'S' curve by vertical lines at the discontinuities gives the hysteresis loop of internal polarization due to an external electric field.\nSliding ferroelectricity.\nSliding ferroelectricity is widely found but only in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals stacked layers. The vertical electric polarization is switched by in-plane interlayer sliding.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A hundred years later, scholars in Germany and England began to shed light on his life and work, including the controversial finding that he may have been the author of a \"Hamlet\" play pre-dating Shakespeare's, which is now known as the \"Ur-Hamlet\".\nEarly life.\nThomas Kyd was the son of Francis and Anna Kyd. There are no records of the day he was born, but he was baptised in the church of St Mary Woolnoth in the Ward of Langborn, Lombard Street, London on 6 November 1558. The baptismal register at St Mary Woolnoth carries this entry: \"Thomas, son of Francis Kydd, Citizen and Writer of the Courte Letter of London\". Francis Kydd was a scrivener and in 1580 was warden of the Scriveners' Company.\nIn October 1565 the young Kyd was enrolled in the newly founded Merchant Taylors' School, whose headmaster was Richard Mulcaster. Fellow students included Edmund Spenser and Thomas Lodge. Here, Kyd received a well-rounded education, with the curriculum including Italian, Latin, Greek, music, drama, physical education, and \"good manners\". There is no evidence that Kyd went on to university. He may have followed in his father's professional footsteps because there are two letters written by him where his handwriting style is similar to that of a scrivener.\nCareer.\nEvidence suggests that in the 1580s Kyd became an important playwright, but little is known about his activity. Francis Meres placed him among \"our best for tragedy\" and Heywood elsewhere called him \"Famous Kyd\". Ben Jonson mentions him in the same breath as Christopher Marlowe (with whom, in London, Kyd at one time shared a room) and John Lyly in the Shakespeare First Folio.\n\"The Spanish Tragedy\" was probably written in the mid to late 1580s, with its first recorded performance on 23 February 1592 by Lord Strange's Men. The earliest surviving edition was printed in 1592, the full title being \"The Spanish Tragedie, Containing the lamentable end of Don Horatio, and Bel-imperia: with the pittifull death of olde Hieronimo\". However, the play was usually known simply as \"Hieronimo\" after the protagonist. It was arguably the most popular play of the \"Age of Shakespeare\" and set new standards in effective plot construction and character development. There were \"twenty-nine performances between 1592 and 1597\" and \"eleven editions between 1592 and 1633\", which the historian J. R. Mulryne states is \"a tally unequaled by any of the plays of Shakespeare\". In 1602 a version of the play with \"additions\" was published. Philip Henslowe's diary records payment to Ben Jonson for additions that year, but it is disputed whether the published additions reflect Jonson's work or if they were actually composed for a 1597 revival of \"The Spanish Tragedy\" also mentioned by Henslowe.\nOther works by Kyd are his translations of Torquato Tasso's \"Padre di Famiglia\", published as \"The Householder's Philosophy\" (1588), and of Robert Garnier's \"Corn\u00e9lie\" (1594), along with the play \"Soliman and Perseda\". Plays disputedly attributed, in whole or in part, to Kyd include \"King Leir\", \"Fair Em\", \"Arden of Faversham\" and parts of \"1 Henry VI\" and \"Edward III\". A play related to \"The Spanish Tragedy\" called \"The First Part of Hieronimo\" (surviving in a quarto of 1605) may be a bad quarto or memorial reconstruction of a play by Kyd, or it may be an inferior writer's burlesque of \"The Spanish Tragedy\" inspired by that play's popularity. Kyd is supposed by some to have been the author of a \"Hamlet\", the precursor of the Shakespearean play (see: \"Ur-Hamlet\").\nThe success of Kyd's plays extended to Europe. Versions of \"The Spanish Tragedy\" were popular in Germany and the Netherlands for generations. The influence of these plays on European drama was largely the reason for the interest in Kyd among German scholars in the nineteenth century.\nLater life.\nFrom 1587 to 1593 Kyd was in the service of an unidentified noble, since, after his imprisonment in 1593 (see below), he wrote of having lost \"the favours of my Lord, whom I haue servd almost theis vi yeres nowe\". Proposed nobles include the Earl of Sussex, the Earl of Pembroke, Lord Strange. and Edward De Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. He may have worked as a secretary, if he did not also write plays. Around 1591 Christopher Marlowe also joined this patron's service, and for a while Marlowe and Kyd shared lodgings, and perhaps even ideas.\nOn 11 May 1593 the Privy Council ordered the arrest of the authors of \"divers lewd and mutinous libels\" which had been posted around London. One libel was found on the property of a Dutch Church and contained violent anti-foreigner sentiments and multiple allusions to the works of Marlowe. The next day, Kyd was among those arrested; he would later believe that he had been the victim of an informer. His lodgings were searched and instead of evidence of the \"libels\" there was found an Arianist tract, described by an investigator as \"vile heretical conceits denying the eternal deity of Jesus Christ found amongst the papers of Thos. Kydd [\"sic\"], prisoner ... which he affirmeth he had from C. Marley [\"sic\"]\". Historians such as Frederick Boas believe that Kyd was tortured brutally to obtain this information. Kyd told authorities the writings found in his possession belonged to Christopher Marlowe, a fellow dramatist and former roommate. Kyd \"accused his former roommate of being a blasphemous traitor, an atheist who believed that Jesus Christ was a homosexual,\" an uninformed confusion over the Arian and early Gnostic concept of homoousios. Following the accusation, Marlowe was summoned by the Privy Council and, while waiting for a decision on his case, was killed in an incident in Deptford involving known government agents.\nKyd was eventually released but was not accepted back into his lord's service. Believing he was under suspicion of atheism himself, he wrote to the Lord Keeper, Sir John Puckering, protesting his innocence, but his efforts to clear his name were apparently fruitless. The last we hear from the playwright is the publication of \"Cornelia\" early in 1594. In the dedication to the Countess of Sussex he alludes to the \"bitter times and privy broken passions\" he had endured. Kyd died later that year at the age of 35, and was buried on 15 August in St Mary Colechurch in London. In December of that same year, Kyd's mother legally renounced the administration of his estate, probably because it was debt-ridden.\nSt Mary Colechurch was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, and not rebuilt.\nWorks.\nThe dates of composition are approximate.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Folios are large, tall volumes; quartos are smaller, roughly half the size. The publications of the latter are usually abbreviated to Q1, Q2, etc., where the letter stands for \"quarto\" and the number for the first, second, or third edition published.\nPlays.\nEighteen of the 36 plays in the First Folio were printed in separate and individual editions prior to 1623. \"Pericles\" (1609) and \"The Two Noble Kinsmen\" (1634) also appeared separately before their inclusions in folio collections (the Shakespeare Third Folio and the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio, respectively). All of these were quarto editions, with two exceptions: \"The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York\", the first edition of \"Henry VI, Part 3\", was printed in octavo form in 1595, as was the 1611 edition of \"The most lamentable tragedy of Titus Andronicus\". In chronological order, these publications were:\nSix of the preceding were classified as \"bad quartos\" by Alfred W. Pollard and other scholars associated with the New Bibliography. Popular plays like \"1 Henry IV\" and \"Pericles\" were reprinted in their quarto editions even after the First Folio appeared, sometimes more than once.\nPoetry.\nShakespeare's poems were also printed in quarto or octavo form:\nDiffering from the quartos of the plays, the first editions of Shakespeare's narrative poems are extremely well printed. \"Richard Field, Shakespeare's first publisher and printer, was a Stratford man, probably a friend of Shakespeare, and the two produced an excellent text.\" Shakespeare may have had direct involvement in the publication of the two poems, a check such as Ben Jonson exercised in reference to the publication of his works, but as Shakespeare clearly did not do in connection with his plays.\nJohn Benson published a collected edition of Shakespeare's \"Poems\" in 1640; the poems were not added to collections of the plays until the 18th century. (The disputed miscellany \"The Passionate Pilgrim\" was only printed in octavo: twice in 1599, with another in 1612, all by William Jaggard.)\nFolios.\nThe folio format was reserved for expensive, prestigious volumes. During Shakespeare's lifetime, stage plays were not generally taken seriously as literature and not considered worthy of being collected into folios, so the plays printed while he was alive were printed as quartos. His poems were never included in his collected works until the eighteenth century.\nIt was not until 1616, the year of Shakespeare's death, that Ben Jonson defied convention by issuing a folio collection of his own plays and poems. Seven years later the folio volume \"Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories &amp; Tragedies\" appeared; this edition is now called the First Folio. It contains 36 plays, 18 of which were printed for the first time. Because Shakespeare was dead, the folio was compiled by John Heminges and Henry Condell (fellow actors in Shakespeare's company), and arranged into comedies, histories and tragedies. The First Folio is generally looked to by actors and directors as the purest form of Shakespeare's text. While punctuation and grammar are not always accurate by today's rules, these things served as direction to the actors on how to say the lines.\nThe First Folio was compiled by Heminges and Condell but published by a trio of stationers (booksellers and publishers): William Jaggard, his son Isaac Jaggard, and Edward Blount. William Aspley and John Smethwick participated in the endeavor as subsidiary partners. It contained, in addition to blandishments provided by various admirers of Shakespeare, such as the dedication signed by \"John Heminge and Henry Condell\", 36 plays. They included \"Troilus and Cressida\", which was not, however, listed in the table of contents, but omitted \"Pericles\" and \"The Two Noble Kinsmen\", which are now usually considered canonical. The Jaggards were printers, and did the actual printing of the book. The elder Jaggard has seemed an odd choice to many commentators, given his problematical relationship with the Shakespeare canon: Jaggard issued the suspect collection \"The Passionate Pilgrim\" in 1599 and 1612, and in 1619 printed the so-called False Folio, ten pirated or spurious Shakespearean plays, some with false dates and title pages. It is thought that the printing of the First Folio was such an enormous task that the Jaggards' shop was simply needed to get the job done. William Jaggard was old, infirm, and blind by 1623, and in fact died a month before the First Folio was complete.\nThe First Folio was reprinted three times in the 17th century:\nThe Second Folio appeared in 1632. Isaac Jaggard had died in 1627, and Edward Blount had transferred his rights to stationer Robert Allot in 1630. The Second Folio was published by Allot, William Aspley, Richard Hawkins, Richard Meighen, and John Smethwick, and printed by Thomas Cotes. It contained the same plays as the First Folio and much of the same additional material, with the addition of an unsigned poem by John Milton. \nThe Third Folio was issued in 1663, published by Philip Chetwinde; Chetwinde had married Robert Allot's widow and so obtained the rights to the book. To the second impression of the Third Folio (1664) he added seven plays, namely \"Pericles, Prince of Tyre;\" \"Locrine;\" \"The London Prodigal;\" \"The Puritan;\" \"Sir John Oldcastle;\" \"Thomas Lord Cromwell;\" and \"A Yorkshire Tragedy.\" (See: Shakespeare Apocrypha.) All seven of these additional plays had been published as quartos while Shakespeare was alive, but only \"Pericles\" was eventually widely accepted into the Shakespearean canon. \nThe quartos of \"Pericles\" (1609 and 1611), \"The London Prodigal\" (1605) and \"A Yorkshire Tragedy\" (1608) were all attributed to William Shakespeare on their front pages. The quartos of \"Locrine\" (1595), \"The Puritan\" (1607) and \"Thomas Lord Cromwell\" (1602 and 1613) were attributed to W. S. on their title pages, but Shakespeare was not the only playwright with those initials; Wentworth Smith has been put forward as another possible author of these works. \"Sir John Oldcastle\" was printed in 1619, three years after Shakespeare's death, as part of the False Folio. It was attributed to Shakespeare on its title page which also bore a false date of 1600.\nThe Third Folio is relatively rare, compared to the Second and Fourth, probably because unsold copies were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. One surviving copy was purchased by the Irish High Court judge and antiquarian William O'Brien in the 1880s. It was put up for auction by Sotheby's in 2017.\nThe Fourth Folio appeared in 1685, published by R. Bentley, E. Brewster, R. Chiswell, and H. Herringman. It contains the same 43 plays as the Third Folio. Brewster, Chiswell, and Herringman were members of the six-man syndicate that published the third Ben Jonson folio in 1692; Herringman was one of three stationers who issued the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio in 1679.\nThe Fourth Folio in turn served as the base for the series of eighteenth-century editions of Shakespeare's plays. Nicholas Rowe used the Fourth Folio text as the foundation of his 1709 edition, and subsequent editors \u2014 Pope, Theobald, etc. \u2014 both adapted and reacted to Rowe's text in their own editions. (See: Shakespeare's editors.)\n\"The Two Noble Kinsmen\" did not appear in any Folio edition. It was not printed until 1634, although there is evidence of its being performed much earlier. The title page said \"written by the memorable worthies of their time: Mr. John Fletcher and Mr. William Shakspeare [\"sic\"], Gent.\" It was not included in most editions of Shakespeare (e.g., the Cambridge/Globe editions of Wright and Clark, ca. 1863) until the latter half of the 19th century (it appears, e.g., in Dyce's collected Works of Shakespeare in 1876) but it was not generally accepted into the Shakespeare canon until well into the 20th century, when, for example, it was included in the Riverside edition of 1974.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44712", "revid": "47063890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44712", "title": "Evil clown", "text": "Pop culture trope and horror staple\nThe evil clown is a subversion of the traditional comic clown character, in which the playful trope is instead depicted in a more disturbing nature through the use of horror elements and dark humor. The modern archetype of the evil clown was popularized by the DC Comics supervillain Joker starting in 1940, and again in the 1980s by Pennywise from Stephen King's \"It\". The character can be seen as playing on the sense of unease felt by sufferers of \"coulrophobia\", the fear of clowns.\nTerminology.\nThe character is also known as the creepy clown, phantom clown, scary clown or killer clown if their character revolves around terrorizing and murdering people.\nOrigins.\nThe modern archetype of the evil clown has unclear origins; the stock character appeared infrequently during the 19th century, in such works as Edgar Allan Poe's \"Hop-Frog\", which is believed by Jack Morgan, of the University of Missouri-Rolla, to draw upon an earlier incident \"at a masquerade ball\", in the 14th century, during which \"the King and his frivolous party, costumed\u2014in highly flammable materials\u2014as simian creatures, were ignited by a flambeau and incinerated, the King narrowly escaping in the actual case.\" Evil clowns also occupied a small niche in drama, appearing in the 1874 work \"La femme de Tabarin\" by Catulle Mend\u00e8s and in Ruggero Leoncavallo's \"Pagliacci\" (accused of being a plagiarism of Mend\u00e8s' piece), both works featuring murderous clowns as central characters.\nAmerican serial killer and rapist John Wayne Gacy became known as the \"Killer Clown\" when arrested in 1978, after it was discovered he had performed as Pogo the Clown at children's parties and other events; however, Gacy did not actually commit his crimes while wearing his clown costume. During the 1980s, the \"National Lampoon\" published a series of mock comic books in the pages of the magazine, entitled \"Evil Clown\", which featured a malevolent character named Frenchy the Clown.\nEvil clown themes were occasionally found in popular music. Zal Cleminson, guitarist with the English rock band The Sensational Alex Harvey Band, wore black and white clown-style makeup and colorful clothes while on stage during the band's 1970s heyday, while his \"happy-sad-happy\" demeanor helped give their performances an edge of menace.\nThe evil clown archetype plays strongly off the sense of dislike it caused to inherent elements of coulrophobia; however, it has been suggested by Joseph Durwin that the concept of evil clowns has an independent position in popular culture, arguing that \"the concept of evil clowns and the widespread hostility it induces is a cultural phenomenon which transcends just the phobia alone\". A study by the University of Sheffield concluded \"that clowns are universally disliked by children. Some found them quite frightening and unknowable.\" This may be because of the nature of clowns' makeup hiding their faces, making them potential threats in disguise; as a psychology professor at California State University, Northridge stated, young children are \"very reactive to a familiar body type with an unfamiliar face\". This natural dislike of clowns makes them effective in a literary or fictional context, as the antagonistic threat perceived in clowns is desirable in a villainous character.\nResearcher Ben Radford, who published \"Bad Clowns\" in 2016 and is regarded as an expert on the phenomenon, writes that looking throughout history clowns are seen as tricksters, fools, and more; however, they always are in control, speak their minds, and can get away with doing so. When writing the book \"Bad Clowns\", Radford found that professional clowns are not generally fond of the bad-clown (or evil-clown) persona. They see them as \"the rotten apple in the barrel, whose ugly sight and smell casts suspicion on the rest of them,\" and do not wish to encourage or propagate coulrophobia. Yet, as Radford discovered, bad clowns have existed throughout history: Harlequin, the King's fool, and Mr. Punch. Radford argues that bad clowns have the \"ability to change with the times\" and that modern bad clowns have evolved into Internet trolls. They may not wear clown costume but, nevertheless, engage with people for their own amusement, abuse, tease and speak what they think of as the \"truth\" much like the court jester and \"dip clowns\" do using \"human foibles\" against their victims. Radford states that, although bad clowns permeate the media in movies, TV, music, comics, and more, the \"good clowns\" outnumber the bad ones. Research shows that most people do not fear clowns but actually love them and that bad clowns are \"the exception, not the rule.\"\nInterpretations.\nThe concept of the evil clown is related to the irrational fear of clowns, known as coulrophobia, a neologism coined in the context of informal \"\"-phobia\" lists\".\nThe cultural critic Mark Dery has theorized the postmodern archetype of the evil clown in \"Cotton Candy Autopsy: Deconstructing Psycho-Killer Clowns\" (a chapter in his cultural critique \"The Pyrotechnic Insanitarium: American Culture on the Brink\").\nTracking the image of the demented or deviant clown across popular culture, Dery analyzes the \"Pogo the Clown\" persona of the serial killer John Wayne Gacy; the obscene clowns of the neo-situationist Cacophony Society; the Joker (of \"Batman\" fame); the grotesque art of R.K. Sloane; the sick-funny Bobcat Goldthwait comedy \"Shakes the Clown\"; \"Scooby-Doo\"'s Ghost Clown from the episode \"Bedlam in the Big Top\"; Horny the Clown in the 2007 horror-comedy movie \"Drive-Thru\", and Pennywise from Stephen King's \"It\".\nUsing Mikhail Bakhtin's theory of the carnivalesque, Jungian and historical writings on the images of the fool in myth and history, and ruminations on the mingling of ecstasy and dread in the Information Age, Dery asserts the evil clown is an icon of our times. Clowns are often depicted as murderous psychopaths at many American haunted houses.\nWolfgang M. Zucker points out the similarities between a clown's appearance and the cultural depictions of demons and other infernal creatures, noting \"[the clown's] chalk-white face in which the eyes almost disappear, while the mouth is enlarged to a ghoulish bigness, looks like the mask of death\".\nAccording to psychology professor Joseph Durwin at California State University, Northridge, young children are \"very reactive to a familiar body type with an unfamiliar face\". Researchers who have studied the phobia believe there is some correlation to the uncanny valley effect. Additionally, clown behavior is often \"transgressive\" (anti-social behavior) which can create feelings of unease.\nA 2022 survey of 987 adults from 64 countries found that 54% of respondents reported experiencing some degree of coulrophobia.\nUrban legends and incidents.\nThe clown sightings.\nThe related urban legend of evil clown sightings in real life is known as \"phantom clowns\". First reported in 1981 in Brookline, Massachusetts, children said that men dressed up as clowns had attempted to lure them into a van. The panic spread throughout the US in the Midwest and Northeast. It resurfaced in 1985 in Phoenix, Arizona; in 1991 in West Orange, New Jersey; in 1990 in Brazil, through a story reported by the Brazilian tabloid \"Not\u00edcias Populares\"; and 1995 in Honduras. Later sightings included Chicago in Illinois in 2008. Explanations for the phenomenon have ranged from Stephen King's \"It\" and the crimes of serial killer John Wayne Gacy, to a moral panic influenced by contemporaneous fears of Satanic ritual abuse. It also shows similarities to the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. In most cases the reports were made by children, and no adults or police officers were able to confirm the sightings.\nIn 2013, a character who became known as \"the Northampton Clown\" was repeatedly sighted standing silently around the English town. The work of three local filmmakers, Alex Powell, Elliot Simpson and Luke Ubanski, the Northampton clown was similar in appearance to Pennywise from Stephen King's \"It\". Although rumors said that the clown may have a knife, the clown himself denied these rumors through social media. In March 2014, Matteo Moroni from Perugia, Italy, owner of YouTube channel DM Pranks, began dressing up as a killer clown and terrifying unsuspecting passers-by, with his videos racking up hundreds of millions of views. In 2014, further complaints of evil clown pranksters were reported in France, the United States and Germany, possibly inspired by \"\".\nIn 2014, \"the Wasco clown\" attracted social media attention in California. Again this clown shared a similar resemblance to Pennywise, and it was revealed that the social media postings were part of a year-long photography project conducted by the artist's wife. In Bakersfield, California \"menacing\" clowns were reported, some with weapons. In July 2015, a \"creepy\" clown was seen around a local cemetery in Chicago and terrorizing anyone in the graveyard.\nThere was another burst of such sightings in 2016, including in South Carolina and New York.\nResearcher Ben Radford writes that there have been many surges of evil clown sightings reported, Radford says it is most likely pranksters. The urban legends and panic can cause real danger as \"face-painted pranksters and innocent bystanders may be at risk\" by interaction of well-intended public or police thinking a threat exists when it does not.\nResponse to evil clowns in media.\nIn 2014, Clowns of America International responded to the depiction of Twisty on \"American Horror Story\", and evil clowns in media generally. President Glenn Kohlberger said, \"Hollywood makes money sensationalizing the norm. They can take any situation no matter how good or pure and turn it into a nightmare. ... We do not support in any way, shape or form any medium that sensationalizes or adds to coulrophobia or 'clown fear.'\"\nIn 2025, British post punk band Half Man Half Biscuit released a single mocking evil clowns and people's fear of them entitled \"Horror Clowns are Dickheads\".\nDepictions.\nThe Joker character in the \"Batman\" franchise was introduced in 1940 and has developed into one of the most recognizable and iconic fictional characters in popular culture, leading \"Wizard\" magazine's \"100 Greatest Villains of All Time\" ranking in 2006. The contemporary \"evil clown\" archetype developed in the 1980s, notably popularized by Pennywise from Stephen King's \"It\", and perhaps influenced by John Wayne Gacy, a serial killer dubbed the \"Killer Clown\" in 1978. \"Killer Klowns from Outer Space\" is a 1988 horror comedy dedicated to the topic. Although Krusty the Clown, a cartoon character introduced 1989 in the animated sitcom \"The Simpsons\", is a comical, non-scary clown, the character reveals darker aspects in his personality. In \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Lisa's First Word\" (1992), children's fear of clowns features in the form of a very young Bart being traumatized by an inexpertly built Krusty the Clown themed bed, repeatedly uttering the phrase \"can't sleep, clown will eat me...\" The phrase inspired an Alice Cooper song in the album \"Dragontown\" (2001) and became a popular catchphrase. Evil clowns are also mentioned in a popular song by P!nk.\nThe American rap duo Insane Clown Posse have exploited this theme since 1989 and have inspired Twiztid and similar acts, many on Psychopathic Records, to do likewise. Websites dedicated to evil clowns and the fear of clowns appeared in the late 1990s.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is possibly a translation of the Dutch play \"Elckerlijc\" (Everyman).\nLike John Bunyan's 1678 Christian novel \"The Pilgrim's Progress\", \"Everyman\" uses allegorical characters to examine the question of Christian salvation and explain that Man must have a relationship with God to attain it. To develop that relationship, his strength, wisdom, senses, beauty and discretion is not helpful. The relationship with God is strengthened through his adherence to rules established by the Church \u2013 the partaking of the Eucharist, confession, penance, and participation in last rites, thus redeeming him and preparing him for eternal salvation.\nSummary.\nThe play is the allegorical accounting of the life of Everyman, who represents all mankind. In the course of the action, Everyman tries to convince other characters to accompany him in the hope of improving his life. All the characters are also mystical; the conflict between good and evil is shown by the interactions between the characters. Everyman is being singled out because it is difficult for him to find characters to accompany him on his pilgrimage. Everyman eventually realizes through this pilgrimage that he is essentially alone, despite all the personified characters that were supposed necessities and friends to him, which ultimately do not lead him closer to Christ. Everyman learns that when he is brought to death and placed before God, his Good Deeds (which in the play include following Church practices of Eucharist, confession, penance and last rites) draw him into salvation with Christ.\nSources.\nThe play was written in Middle English during the Tudor period, but the identity of the author is unknown. Although the play was apparently produced with some frequency in the seventy-five years following its composition, no production records survive.\nThere is a similar Dutch-language morality play of the same period called \"Elckerlijc\". In the early 20th century, scholars did not agree on which of these plays was the original, or even on their relation to a later Latin work named \"Homulus\". By the 1980s, Arthur Cawley went so far as to say that the \"evidence for \u2026 Elckerlijk is certainly very strong\", and now Davidson, Walsh, and Broos hold that \"more than a century of scholarly discussion has ... convincingly shown that \"Everyman\" is a translation and adaptation from the Dutch \"Elckerlijc\"\".\nSetting.\nThe cultural setting is based on the Roman Catholicism of the era. Everyman attains afterlife in heaven by means of receiving the Catholic Sacraments, in particular Confession, Penance, Anointing of the Sick (Unction), and receiving the Eucharist.\nSynopsis.\nThe oldest surviving example of the script begins with this paragraph on the frontispiece:\nAfter a brief prologue asking the audience to listen, God speaks, lamenting that humans have become too absorbed in material wealth and riches to follow Him, so He commands Death to go to Everyman and summon him to heaven to make his reckoning. Death arrives at Everyman's side to tell him it is time to die and face judgment. Upon hearing this, Everyman is distressed, so begs for more time. Death denies this, but will allow Everyman to find a companion for his journey.\nEveryman's friend Fellowship promises to go anywhere with him, but when he hears of the true nature of Everyman's journey, he refuses to go. Everyman then calls on Kindred and Cousin and asks them to go with him, but they both refuse. In particular, Cousin explains a fundamental reason why no people will accompany Everyman: they have their own accounts to write as well. Afterwards, Everyman asks Goods, who will not come: God's judgment will be severe because of the selfishness implied in Goods's presence.\nEveryman then turns to Good Deeds, who says she would go with him, but she is too weak as Everyman has not loved her in his life. Good Deeds summons her sister Knowledge to accompany them, and together they go to see Confession. In the presence of Confession, Everyman begs God for forgiveness and repents his sins, punishing himself with a scourge. After his scourging, Everyman is absolved of his sins, and as a result, Good Deeds becomes strong enough to accompany Everyman on his journey with Death.\nGood Deeds then summons Beauty, Strength, Discretion and Five Wits to join them, and they agree to accompany Everyman as he goes to a priest to take sacrament. After the sacrament, Everyman tells them where his journey ends, and again they all abandon him \u2013 except for Good Deeds. Even Knowledge cannot accompany him after he leaves his physical body, but will stay with him until the time of death.\nContent at last, Everyman climbs into his grave with Good Deeds at his side and dies, after which they ascend together into heaven, where they are welcomed by an Angel. The play closes as the Doctor enters and explains that in the end, a man will only have his Good Deeds to accompany him beyond the grave.\nAdaptations.\nA modern stage production of \"Everyman\" did not appear until July 1901 when The Elizabethan Stage Society of William Poel gave three outdoor performances at the Charterhouse in London. Poel then partnered with British actor Ben Greet to produce the play throughout Britain, with runs on the American Broadway stage from 1902 to 1918, and concurrent tours throughout North America. These productions differed from past performances in that women were cast in the title role, rather than men. Film adaptations of the 1901 version of the play appeared in 1913 and 1914, with the 1913 film being made with an early color two-process, Kinemacolor.\nA version was filmed for Australian TV in 1964.\nAnother well-known version of the play is \"Jedermann\" by the Austrian playwright Hugo von Hofmannsthal, which has been performed annually at the Salzburg Festival since 1920, and adapted into film several times. \"Jedermann\" received an English language adaptation in 1917, \"The Play of Everyman\". The 1917 adaptation was performed at the Trinity Auditorium in Los Angeles, followed by a run at the Burbank Theater in Burbank, California, and was translated and adapted by George Sterling with \"Richard\" Ryszard Ordynski and music by Victor Schertzinger. The Sterling adaptation was performed again in 1936 at the Hollywood Bowl with music by Einar Nelson.\nFrederick Franck published a modernised version of the tale entitled \"Everyone\", drawing on Buddhist influence.\nA direct-to-video film of \"Everyman\" was made in 2002, directed by John Farrell, which updated the setting to the early 21st century, including Death as a businessman in dark glasses with a briefcase, and Goods being played by a talking personal computer.\nJo Clifford's play \"Every One\", a modern version of \"Everyman\", premiered at the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh in 2010.\nIn 2014, London theatre company Scena Mundi Theatre (then Little Spaniel Theatre) staged a production of \"Everyman\" at St Bartholomew the Great, a Church in the City of London. The play, directed by Cecilia Dorland, played on the church's medieval setting and kept the Middle English text intact. A strong ensemble piece using music and singing, it was very well received by critics.\nA modernized adaptation by Carol Ann Duffy, the Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom, with Chiwetel Ejiofor in the title role, was performed at the National Theatre from April to July 2015.\nIn December 2016, Moravian University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania presented \"Everyman on Trial\", a contemporary adaptation written and directed by Christopher Shorr.\nBranden Jacobs-Jenkins' adaptation, titled \"Everybody\", premiered in 2017 at the Pershing Square Signature Center in New York City.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

However, it can also be viewed as the simplest class of wavetable-modification algorithms now known as digital waveguide synthesis, because the delay line acts to store one period of the signal.\nAlexander Strong invented the algorithm, and Kevin Karplus did the first analysis of how it worked. Together they developed software and hardware implementations of the algorithm, including a custom VLSI chip. They named the algorithm \"Digitar\" synthesis, as a portmanteau for \"digital guitar\".\nTuning the string.\nThe fundamental frequency (specifically, the lowest nonzero resonant frequency) of the resulting signal is the lowest frequency at which the unwrapped phase response of the delay and filter in cascade is formula_1. The required phase delay \"D\" for a given fundamental frequency \"F\"0 is therefore calculated according to \"D\" = \"F\"\"s\"/\"F\"0 where \"F\"\"s\" is the sampling frequency.\nThe length of any digital delay line is a whole-number multiple of the sampling period. In order to obtain a fractional delay often needed for fine tuning the string below JND (Just Noticeable Difference), interpolating filters are used with parameters selected to obtain an appropriate phase delay at the fundamental frequency. Either IIR or FIR filters may be used, but FIR have the advantage that transients are suppressed if the fractional delay is changed over time. The most elementary fractional delay is the linear interpolation between two samples (e.g., \"s\"(4.2) = 0.8\"s\"(4) + 0.2\"s\"(5)). If the phase delay varies with frequency, harmonics may be sharpened or flattened relative to the fundamental frequency. The original algorithm used equal weighting on two adjacent samples, as this can be achieved without multiplication hardware, allowing extremely cheap implementations.\nZ-transform analysis can be used to get the pitches and decay times of the harmonics more precisely, as explained in the 1983 paper that introduced the algorithm.\nA demonstration of the Karplus-Strong algorithm can be heard in the following Vorbis file. The algorithm used a loop gain of 0.98 with increasingly attenuating first order lowpass filters. The pitch of the note was A2, or 220\u00a0Hz.\nHolding the period (= length of the delay line) constant produces vibrations similar to those of a string or bell. Increasing the period sharply after the transient input produces drum-like sounds.\nRefinements to the algorithm.\nDue to its plucked-string sound in certain modes, Alex Strong and Kevin Karplus conjectured that the Karplus-Strong (KS) algorithm was in some sense a vibrating string simulation, and they worked on showing that it solved the wave equation for the vibrating string, but this was not completed. Julius O. Smith III http:// recognized that the transfer-function of the KS, when viewed as a digital filter, coincided with that of a vibrating string, with the filter in the feedback loop representing the total string losses over one period. He later derived the KS algorithm as a special case of digital waveguide synthesis, which was used to model acoustic waves in strings, tubes, and membranes. The first set of extensions and generalizations of the Karplus-Strong Algorithm, typically known as the Extended Karplus-Strong (EKS) Algorithm, was presented in a paper in 1982 at the International Computer Music Conference in Venice, Italy, and published in more detail in 1983 in Computer Music Journal in an article entitled \"Extensions of the Karplus Strong Plucked String Algorithm,\" by David A. Jaffe and Julius O. Smith, and in Smith's PhD/EE dissertation.\nAlex Strong developed a superior wavetable-modification method for plucked-string synthesis, but only published it as a patent.\nMusical applications.\nThe first musical use of the algorithm was in the work \"May All Your Children Be Acrobats\" written in 1981 by David A. Jaffe, and scored for eight guitars, mezzo-soprano and computer-generated stereo tape, with a text based on Carl Sandburg's \"The People, Yes\". Jaffe continued to explore the musical and technical possibilities of the algorithm in \"Silicon Valley Breakdown\", for computer-generated plucked strings (1982), as well as in later works such as \"Telegram to the President, 1984\" for string quartet and tape, and \"Grass\" for female chorus and tape (1987).\nThe patent was licensed first to Mattel Electronics, which failed as a company before any product using the algorithm was developed, then to a startup company founded by some of the laid-off Mattel executives. They never got sufficient funding to finish development, and so never brought a product to market either. Eventually Yamaha licensed the patent, as part of the Sondius package of patents from Stanford. It is unknown whether any hardware using the algorithm was ever sold, though many software implementations (which did not pay any license fees to the inventors) have been released.\nWhile they may not adhere strictly to the algorithm, many hardware components for modular systems have been commercially produced that invoke the basic principles of Karplus-Strong Synthesis: using an inverted, scaled control system for very small time values in a filtered delay line to create playable notes in the Western Tempered tuning system, controlled with volt per octave tracking or MIDI data. The Inventors were not specifically credited, though the term \"Karplus-Strong Synthesis\" is referenced in some of the manuals. \nHardware components capable of Karplus-Strong style synthesis include the Moog Clusterflux 108M, Mutable Instruments Elements and Rings, 4ms Company Dual Looping Delay, 2HP Pluck, Make Noise Mimeophon, Arturia MicroFreak, Non Linear Circuits Is Carp Lust Wrong?, and the Strymon Starlab.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44715", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44715", "title": "Morality play", "text": "Genre of Medieval and early Tudor drama\nThe morality play is a genre of medieval and early Tudor drama. The term is used by scholars of literary and dramatic history to refer to a genre of play texts from the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries that feature personified concepts (most often virtues and vices, but sometimes practices or habits) alongside angels and demons, who are engaged in a struggle to persuade a protagonist who represents a generic human character toward either good or evil. The common story arc of these plays follows \"the temptation, fall and redemption of the protagonist\".\nEnglish morality plays.\nHildegard von Bingen's \"Ordo Virtutum\" (English: \"Order of the Virtues\"), composed c. 1151 in Germany, is the earliest known morality play by more than a century, and it is the only medieval musical drama to survive with an attribution for both the text and the music. Because there are many formal differences between this play and later medieval moralities, as well as the fact that it only exists in two manuscripts, it is unlikely that the \"Ordo Virtutum\" had any direct influence on the writing of its later English counterparts.\nTraditionally, scholars name only five surviving English morality plays from the medieval period: \"The Pride of Life\" (late 14th century), \"The Castle of Perseverance\" (c.1425); \"Wisdom\", (1460\u201363); \"Mankind\" (c.1470); \"Everyman\" (1510). \"The Pride of Life\" was the earliest record of a morality play written in the English language; the text (destroyed by fire in 1922, but published earlier) existed on the back of a parchment account roll from June 30, 1343, to January 5, 1344, from the Priory of the Holy Trinity in Dublin. However, this textual record was incomplete. The play cut off mid-line, when the character Messenger, at the command of the King, called upon Death; the plot summary provided by the introductory banns, featured at the beginning of the play, indicated that the action continued.\n\"The Castle of Perseverance\", \"Wisdom\", and \"Mankind\" are all part of a single manuscript called the Macro Manuscript, named after its first known owner, Cox Macro of Bury St Edmunds. A second copy of the first 752 lines of \"Wisdom\" is preserved in MS Digby 133. It is possible that the Macro version was copied from the Digby manuscript, but there is also the possibility that both were copied from elsewhere. Unlike \"The Pride of Life\" and the Macro plays, all of which survive only in manuscript form, \"Everyman\" exists as a printed text, in four different sources. Two of these four sources were printed by Pynson and two were printed by John Skot. Pamela King notes how Everyman's status as a printed text pushes the boundaries of the medieval morality genre; she writes, \"It was also one of the very first plays to be printed, and in some respects belongs more to the early Tudor tradition than that of the late Middle Ages.\"\nOther English moralities include the fifteenth-century plays \"Occupation &amp; Idleness\" and Henry Medwall's \"Nature\", as well as an array of sixteenth-century works like \"The World and the Child\" and John Skelton's \"Magnificence\". Additionally, there are other sixteenth-century plays that take on the typical traits of morality plays as outlined above, such as \"Hickscorner\", but they are not generally categorized as such. The characters in \"Hickscorner\" are personified vices and virtues: Pity, Perseverance, Imagination, Contemplation, Freewill, and Hickscorner.\nThe French medieval morality play tradition is also quite rich: for an explanation of French medieval morality plays, visit .\nHistory of the term \"morality play\".\nWhile scholars refer to these works as morality plays, the play texts do not refer to themselves as such; rather, the genre and its nomenclature have been retroactively conceived by scholarship as a way for modern scholars to understand a series of texts that share enough commonalities that they may be better understood together. Thus, as scholar Pamela King has noted, the morality plays' \"absolute cohesion as a group\" is \"bound to be questioned in any attempt to define that form in its individual manifestations and theatrical contexts.\" As for the history of the term itself in modern usage, premodern plays were separated into 'moralities' and 'mysteries' by Robert Dodsley in the 18th century; he categorized moralities as allegorical plays and mysteries as biblical plays, though nothing suggests that the moralities are not biblical or would not conceive of themselves as such.\nAlthough they do not explicitly label themselves with the genre title morality plays, some of the play texts self-reflexively refer to themselves with the term \"game.\" While the Middle English spelling of \"game\" varies, the noun generally refers to a joy, festivity, amusement, or play. In the opening lines of \"The Pride of Life\", the Prolocutor uses the word game when asking his audience to listen attentively, stating, Lordinges and ladiis that beth hende,\nHerkenith al with mylde mode \n[How ou]re \"gam\" schal gyn and ende (l. 5-7, emphasis added).\nIn the closing lines of \"The Castle of Perseverance\", the character Pater (meaning The Father) tells the audience, \"Thus endyth oure gamys\" (l. 3645).\nWhile these plays appear to self-reflexively refer to their dramatic form, it is only \"Everyman\" that explicitly describes itself as a moral play, both in its incipit (\"Here begynneth a treatyse... in maner of a morall playe\") and when a character, Messenger, states that this literary work will communicate \"By fygure [of] a morall playe\" (l. 3). However, one should not interpret these self-reflexive lines as simply moments that identify the genre of morality plays. Although the lines use the word \"playe,\" scholarship remains unsure if \"Everyman\" was actually staged as a dramatic performance, or if the text was a literary work intended for reading. The 1901 modern revival of the play, staged by Willian Poem, is the earliest record of the play's production. Additionally, \"Everyman\" is a translation of the Dutch \"Elckerlijc\", and, therefore, is not originally an English literary work. Thus, due to the uncertainty regarding the play's status as a dramatic work, as well as the play's non-English origins, \"Everyman\"'s self-reflective identification as a \"morall playe\" cannot confirm that the medieval moralities explicitly name themselves as a cohesive medieval morality genre.\nCharacteristics.\nMorality plays typically contain a protagonist who represents humanity as a whole, or an average layperson, or a human faculty; supporting characters are personifications of abstract concepts, each aligned with either good or evil, virtue or vice.\nThe clashes between the supporting characters often catalyze a process of experiential learning for the protagonist, and, as a result, provide audience members and/or readers with moral guidance, reminding them to meditate and think upon their relationship to God, as well as their social and/or religious community. Many, but not all, of the morality plays also encourage their audiences and/or readers to reflect upon the importance of penitential ritual.\nSeveral academics have written upon these common thematic characteristics. Considering the plays' investment in staging the audience's/reader's relationship to God, Eleanor Johnson writes that Wisdom and Mankind, among several other medieval literary works, dramatically stage acts of contemplation to encourage the \"cultivation of self-conscious participation in God and of awareness of God's participation in man,\" while \"creating literary experiences that initiate work of spiritual contemplation.\" Additionally, Julie Paulson explores the plays' investment in relating penitential ritual and community; she writes, \"In the moralities, it is impossible to split an interior self from the exterior practices and institutions that define it [...] By dramatizing their protagonists' fall and recovery through penance, the plays suggest how the experience of penitential ritual shapes penitents' understandings of the social and moral concepts central to the formation of Christian subjects.\" It is worth noting that Paulson, in making these summative comments, focuses her analysis on \"The Castle of Perseverance\", the Macro plays, \"Everyman\", and several moralities from the sixteenth century, and thus does not aim to characterize all moralities in her commentary.\nAllegory and personification.\nWorking to pinpoint a literary form that unites the moralities, the \"Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms\" offers this definition: \"Morality plays are dramatized allegories, in which personified virtues, vices, diseases, and temptations struggle for the soul of Man.\" The same book defines allegory as \"a story or visual image with a second distinct meaning partially hidden behind its literal or visible meaning. The principal technique of allegory is personification, whereby abstract qualities are given human shape [...] allegory involves a continuous parallel between two (or more) levels of meaning in a story.\" While the \"Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms\" uses the words \"allegory\" and \"personification\" in tandem with one another, the link between the two terms is a point of debate among scholars. Walter Melion and Bart M. Ramakers indicate that literary personifications are the building blocks for creating allegory: arguing for \"personification as a mode of allegorical signification,\" Melion and Ramakers state, \"As narrative, dramatic, or pictorial characters [personifications] develop a distinct reality,\" specifically, a reality that connects the literal and metaphorical interpretations of an allegory. However, Michael Silk insists that there is a fundamental difference between personification and allegory, as the representational figures within literary works are personifications that retain allegorical qualities. Additionally, Silk notes that \"Various medievalists correctly insist that in antiquity and the Middle Ages the connection [between allegory and personification] is not made,\" indirectly complicating the notion that morality plays are \"allegorical\" constructions employing personified concepts.\nWhile an allegorical literary form implies that literal and metaphorical elements must \"continuously parallel\" one another, these plays do not always allegorically parallel theological qualities/concepts and concrete action, but rather humanize abstract concepts\u2014thereby emphasizing characters as personifications, but not allegorical constructions. For example, examining the character Mercy in \"Mankind\", Pamela King notes, \"Mercy the character begs God for the quality he represents, which is, strictly speaking, allegorical nonsense; he stands more for the human aegis by which mercy may be obtained, than for the quality itself.\" Similarly, Eleanor Johnson explains Mercy's humanity, implying his status as a personified concept: \"Mercy suffers, Mercy trembles, Mercy is vulnerable; this is not an untouchable, impregnable Mercy [...] but rather a strikingly vulnerable and human one\". Additionally, scholars complicate the notion that morality plays allegorically parallel the audience with the dramatic characters, indicating that the moralities actually incorporate the audience into the dramatic community. For example, writing on \"The Castle of Perseverance\", Andrea Louise Young argues that the implied staging of the play (which includes the positioning of characters, as well as the placement of scaffolds and banners) encourages audience members to actively engage with the drama in a physical manner: \"In moving around the play space, spectators can change the meaning of the drama for themselves and the other spectators.\" Young notes that the play invites audience members to enter the dramatic space and consequently position themselves through both \"their eyes and their bodies,\" through where they choose to look and move in relation to the staged characters. King, Johnson, and Young indirectly show, without explicitly stating so, how the morality plays are not simply allegorical constructions, but rather fluid forms of personification that blur the distinctions between literal and metaphorical elements, characters and audience members/readers.\nStill, scholarship generally adopts the literary labels \"allegory\", \"personification\", and \"personification allegory\" to explain the morality plays' formal depiction of the relationship between the abstract realm of concepts and everyday circumstances of human life. Pamela King notes the \"broadly allegorical\" form unifying the moralities. King suggests that the plays employ an allegorical framework of personification to metaphorically parallel, and conceptually separate, \"the ephemeral and imperfect world of everyday existence\" from an abstract \"eternal reality\". While King indicates that the plays show the dramatic action to merely parallel and imitate eternal, abstract concepts, Julie Paulson argues that the moralities use personification allegory to reunite the concrete and the abstract. Paulson writes, \"in giving a word such as 'wisdom' or 'mankind' a body and a voice, personification allegory instead returns us to the lived experiences and particular circumstances that give those words their meanings\". Additionally, Paulson underscores that plays such as \"The Castle of Perseverance\" and \"Everyman\" employ protagonists that personify humankind in an allegorical parallel to the audiences and readers of the play. As one can see, different authors employ the literary terms \"allegory\" and \"personification\" to argue various conclusions about the plays' separation or unification of abstract and concrete realities.\nJustice and Equity as characters.\nIn early English dramas Justice was personified as an entity which exercised \"theological virtue or grace, and was concerned with the divine pronouncement of judgment on man\". However, as time progressed, more moralities began to emerge; it is during this transitional period where one begins to see Justice begin to assume more and more the qualities of a judge. The Justice in \"Respublica\" begins to concern himself with administering justice on \"the criminal element\", rather than with the divine pronouncement on a generic representative of mankind. This is the first instance where one may observe a direct divergence from the theological virtues and concerns that were previously exerted by Justice in the morality plays of the fifteenth century. The Justice in \"Respublica\" is personified as a \"civil force rather than a theological one\". An evolution of sorts takes place within the morals and agendas of Justice: he begins to don the Judicial Robe of prosecutor and executioner.\nAnother change envelops in the character of Justice during the sixteenth century in morality plays; Equity replaces Justice and assumes the judiciary duties previously performed by Justice. This changing of rulers, or preceding justices, is done when Equity declares that his brother Justice has been banished from the country and that he (Equity) will from now on take on the duties of the former monarch, Justice. This change of ruling heads is portrayed in the morality play, \"Liberality and Prodigality\", where Equity serves Virtue in the detection, arrest, and punishment of Prodigality for the robbery and murder of Tenacity, a yeoman in the country of Middlesex. Virtue states,\nSo horrible a fact can hardly pleaded for favour:\nTherefore go you, Equity, examine more diligently\nThe manner of this outrageous robbery:\nAnd as the same by examination shall appear,\nDue justice may be done in presence here. (\"Liberality and Prodigality\" 377)\nThe meta phases that Justice undergoes during the sixteenth century in morality plays, from \"Justice\" to \"Equity\" further illustrates the evolution of Justice; not only did Justice change from a \"theological abstraction to a civil servant\", but he experienced a corporeal change as well.\nOne may readily observe the evolutionary progression of Justice as portrayed in the plays of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. One encounters Justice in the early-fifteenth-century moralities as a performer playing the role of a theological virtue or grace, and then one sees him develop to a more serious figure, occupying the position of an arbiter of justice during the sixteenth century. It is a journey of discovery and great change on which Justice welcomes one to embark as one leafs through the pages of morality plays.\nUse of language and poetic technique.\nAll of the morality plays, especially the Macro plays, show not only a mastery of language but also a light-hearted delight therein.\nAll of the plays are written in some sort of end-rhymed verse, but with much variation, not only between the plays but in individual plays as well. Often verse is used to contrast the personalities of good and evil characters. For example, in \"Wisdom\" the characters Wysdom and Anima speak in \"dignified, regular rhythm, almost always with four stresses\" and the rhyme scheme ABABBCBC whereas \"Lucifer prefers a tripping measure with two to five stress and only two rhymes.\" Other characters speak like Wisdom when under his influence and like Lucifer when under his. This system of contrastive verse is further refined in \"Mankind\" (Ramsay cxxxix). This is not the only use of variation in meter. For example, even without having to contrast with a good character's manner of talking, when Mankind ascends to World's scaffold in \"The Castle of Perseverance\", Mundus, Voluptas, and Stultitia briefly switch from a four stress line to a faster and more excited two stress line (ll. 610\u2013646), before returning to the four stress line after a scene change.\nAlliteration is put to wonderful effect in \"The Castle of Perseverance\". It appears in every stanza of more than four lines, though this is not evenly distributed, with later debate scenes employing less alliteration and the characters World, Belial, Flesh, and the seven sins alliterating nearly all of their lines, a habit the character Mankind learns from them. This is not to imply that alliteration is purely the mark of an evil character, for the bad angel alliterates very little and the neutral flag bearers who provide a summary of events at the beginning of the play script make extensive use of alliteration. At many points this is for ornamental effect: Michael R. Kelley places this in the context of a flamboyant style originating in Franco-Burgundian culture. But that is not all the playwright does with the effect. Clare Wright argues convincingly that alliteration among other formal structures encourages the actors to perform with a \"devilish corporeal register.\" She uses Belyal's first speech as an example:Now I sytte, Satanas, in my sad synne, (Now sit I, Satan, steadfast in my sin,)\nAs devyl dowty, in draf as a drake. (As devil doughty, like a dragon on my sack.)\nI champe and I chafe, I chocke on my chynne, (I champ and I chew and I thrust out my chin;)\nI am boystous and bold, as Belyal the blake. (I am boisterous and bold as Belial the black!)\nWhat folk that I grope thei gapyn and grenne, (The folk that I grasp they gasp and they groan,)\nIwys, fro Carlylle into Kent my carpynge thei take, (From Carlisle to Kent, my carping they take!)\nBothe the bak and the buttoke brestyth al on brenne, (Both the back and the buttocks burst burning unbound,)\nWyth werkys of wreche I werke hem mykyl wrake. (With works of vengeance, them wretched I make.)\nIn this speech, many of the alliterated phonemes are \"aggressively plosive\" and the /t\u0283/ of \"I champe and I chafe, I choke on my chynne\" \"requires the speaker to part his lips and bare his teeth, bringing them together in an expression that resembles the clenched-tooth grimace of the devil in contemporary iconography.\" \nWhile mostly written in Middle English, some of the plays employ Latin and French to wonderful effect, both thematically significant and just plain humorous. Latin, of course, as the language of the Roman Catholic Church, was naturally important for the sort of religious discourse these plays engaged in. That does not mean that the playwrights were unwilling to play with Latin. For example, in \"Mankind\", the character Mercy has a highly Latinizing manner of speech: in terms of vocabulary and meticulously tidy versification and sentence structure, all of which culminates in what one scholar calls \"inkhorn and churchily pedagogical.\" (Johnson 172). Mercy ends his first speech saying \"I besech yow hertyly, have this premedytacyon\" (l. 44), ending with a cumbersome Latin loanword. The first vice character on stage, Mischief, immediately picks up on Mercy's excessive Latinisms and continues with this end rhyme in order to mock Mercy's ornate speech:I beseche yow hertyly, leve yowr calcacyon.\nLeve yowr chaffe, leve yowr corn, leve yowr dalyacyon.\nYowr wytt ys lytyll, yowr hede ys mekyll, ye are full of predycacyon (ll. 45-47).\nShortly thereafter Mischief fully switches to a nonsense mixture of Latin and English to continue mocking Mercy's Latinizing, as well as to mangle Mercy's earlier reference to the parable of the wheat and tares: \"Corn servit bredibus, chaffe horsibus, straw fyrybusque\" (l. 57, translated: Corn serves bread, chaff horses, straw fires). The result of this is not only to show that the formal structures of Latin are nothing more than formal structures that can be spoofed and misused, but also to create a tone shift from stuffy seriousness to an amusement that \"is central to the contemplative logic of the play\" by showing how even Latin can be \"dragged from the reaches of the church and into the mess of everyday life.\" There are many such examples of amusing nonsense Latin throughout the play.\nIn what is possibly most memorable of the vices' use of puns to twist good into bad, at one point in \"Mankind\" belt out a vibrant ditty on defecation that concludes, in a clear echo of 'holy holy holy,' with \"Hoylyke, holyke, holyke! Holyke, holyke, holyke!\", quite possibly a pun on 'hole-lick' or 'hole-leak'. Because of how this spoofs liturgical call-and-response worship as well as Nought's invitation, \"Now I prey all the yemandry that ys here / To synge wyth us wyth a mery chere\" (ll. 333\u20134), this is likely a moment of audience participation to highlight their own \"susceptibilities to seduction by frivolity.\"\nFinally, a peculiar trait that one will likely notice while reading these plays is the tendency of characters to describe in speech the actions they are (presumably) simultaneously performing as a way of verbally encoding stage directions. For example, in \"Mankind\", the character Mankind says, \"Thys earth wyth my spade I shall assay to delffe\" (l. 328); this line, meaning, \"This earth with my spade I will attempt to dig,\" appears to serve as a stage direction for Mankind's actor to literally dig. Besides simple actions, the same thing occurs in slapstick comedy or action scenes: when Mankind fights the vice-characters Nowadays, New Guise, and Nought, Mankind threatens to hit them with his shovel, saying, \"Go and do yowr labur! Gode lett yow never the! / Or wyth my spade I shall yow dynge, by the Holy Trinyt\u00e9!\" (ll. 377\u2013376); in response, New Guise says, \"Alas, my jewellys! I shall be schent of my wyff!\" (l. 381), directly indicating that Mankind has hit him as or right after he was threatening. This is not a trait restricted in the period to morality plays: a reason for the existence of this trait suggested by one scholar while discussing the Chester plays is that \"A spectator who could see the action without hearing the lines would not have a significantly different experience from someone who could hear them.\"\nThematic characteristics.\nWhat binds morality plays together as a genre are the strong family resemblances between them. These resemblances are most strong in regard to personification allegory as a literary form. The plays also resemble each other in regard to thematic content. They feature other common characteristics that are not necessarily common to all texts within the genre. Particularly notable thematic commonalities include: the transitoriness of life in relation to the afterlife, the importance of divine mercy, the use of misprision by vice characters, and the inevitable cycle of sin and penitence found in the Macro plays and Henry Medwall's \"Nature\" (c. 1495). The emphasis on death in these plays underscores how to live a good life; in the medieval moralities and Medwall's \"Nature\" in particular, virtue characters encourage the generic human protagonist to secure a good afterlife by performing good deeds, practicing penitence, or asking for divine mercy before their death.\nJohn Watkins also suggests that the principal vices in medieval morality plays, avarice, pride, extortion, and ambition, throw anxieties over class mobility into relief. Fifteenth-century plays like \"Occupation and Idleness\" and later morality plays (commonly considered Tudor interludes, like John Skelton's \"Magnyfycence\") portray class-mobility positively. Whether for or against class mobility, morality plays engage with the subject. Other, smaller commonalities include audience participation, elaborate costuming, the virtue of labour, and the governance of the body/passions by the soul/reason in the service of Catholic virtue, money management, or the proper methods of governing a state.\nThe cohesion of the medieval morality play genre in particular is questionable as their family resemblances are loose in some instances. Despite being treated as the archetypal morality play, \"Everyman\"'s plot has little in common with the other plays in the genre. That said, \"Everyman\"'s straightforward focus on death, uninterested in the cycle of sin and penitence found in the Macro plays, resembles the \"Pride of Life\". These two plays are less like the Macro plays than Medwall's \"Nature\", which is not traditionally considered as a medieval morality play. Scholars such as Katherine Little, who claims that \"Everyman\" is not a medieval morality play, continue to pull at the genre's incohesive threading.\nThere are points of distinction in morality plays, beginning with \"Everyman\", which can generally be attributed to humanism. According to Thomas Betteridge and Greg Walker, the majority of English dramas were religious in some form. However, plays are increasingly divorced from religion, and in particular, the staging of God and priests. While drama continued to contain religious themes, it was less and less often the case that religion was expressed directly. Betteridge and Walker also note that morality plays began to focus on the importance of education, specifically in regard to classical literature.\nIn Medwall's \"Nature\", the opening speech prompts readings of Ovid and Aristotle. However, a strong focus on education can be found in \"Occupation and Idleness\" as well, which stages an errant schoolboy being taught to respect and learn from his teacher\u2014this play is roughly contemporaneous with the Macro plays, suggesting that humanist trends are traceable in the morality play much earlier than \"Everyman\". There is also a general, continuous increase in the individuation and complexity of characters. In \"Nature\", a prostitute is given a regular name rather than the name of a concept. In \"Everyman\", Everyman's mercantile language suggests a generic protagonist that represents a much smaller generic portion of humanity, '\"every merchant,\" in juxtaposition to Mankind's earlier, full representation of all humanity. In Skelton's \"Magnyfycence\", Magnificence and the vices that corrupt him represent a particular person, King Henry VIII, and his court 'minions' who were expelled for their poor behaviour.\nHistorical background.\nArundel's Constitutions.\nScholars have long noted that the medieval morality plays were written after the creation of Arundel's Constitutions in 1407, whereby the Archbishop Thomas Arundel and his legislation sought to limit the preaching and teaching of religious matters, and outlawed any biblical translations into the vernacular. His Constitutions were written in explicit response to the threat of Lollardy. Since the morality plays do contain aspects of religious doctrine, such as the importance of penance and the salvation of the soul, scholars have questioned how it is that morality plays, in both the play-text and play form, continued to thrive throughout the fifteenth century. While scholars have not arrived at a satisfying conclusion, they nonetheless agree the morality plays were not seriously affected by the Constitutions, which suggests that either Arundel's Constitutions, the divide between Lollardy and orthodoxy, or the role that morality plays themselves played in society, continue to be somewhat misunderstood.\nDecline.\nThe recent trend in scholarship of the period in which morality plays were written is to admit the great degree of continuity between late medieval and Renaissance cultures of Europe. Nevertheless, although morality plays reach their apogee in the sixteenth century, religious drama of this sort and in general all but disappeared thereafter. The cause of this change can be traced to both changes in religious sensibilities related to the Protestant Reformation and more broadly changes in theatre as an industry in England.\nMid-Tudor Protestants continued writing religious plays that were recognizably different from their Catholic predecessors. For example, whereas earlier plays emphasize the importance of sacraments, plays by Protestants emphasize justification by faith alone, and even cast vice characters as Catholic.\nThe relationship between theatricality and doctrine was also found more troubled by Protestants. Earlier plays were criticized for their embellishments to biblical material, to which Protestant religious drama tried to adhere more closely. However, in many ways they were formally quite similar to their predecessors in ways that sat beside the tendencies they wished to resist, thus challenging any attempts by scholars to place the development of theater in the period in an evolutionary model.\nWith the opening of permanent and professional playhouses that were producing plays full time in the late sixteenth century, drama became \"unmistakably an integral and compromised part of that same commercial culture\" which earlier religious drama had criticized, and therefor \"it could no longer seriously be maintained that it was primarily a pious activity.\" Thus, by the start of the seventeenth century a play like Everyman would be regarded \"as at best a waste of time and at worst a sinful, 'popish' excess.\" However, this change \"had the positive effect of creating the space for the artistic and commercial speculation of the public stage as it emerged at the end of the Tudor period.\" It is in this space that the now better-known William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe would do their work.\nPre-Reformation versus Post-Reformation.\nThe outward purpose of all morality plays is to instruct listeners on the means of receiving redemption: a purpose that some plays adhere to relatively consistently, while others delight so extensively in their vices that broad entertainment establishes itself as an equally dominant \"raison d'etre\". However, morality plays after the Protestant Reformation are of a distinctly different didacticism than the morality plays before the Reformation.\nWhereas the didactic elements pre-Reformation morality plays usually reinforced the practices or doctrines of medieval Catholicism (often focusing on sacraments like penance), the post-Reformation morality plays\u2014when they concerned themselves with religious doctrine, rather than more secular concerns about education or good living (as with John Redford's \"Play of Wit and Science\") -- sometimes worked to destroy Catholic credibility and demonise the Catholic Church. Although many post-Reformation morality plays were often like their predecessors in that they also were concerned with the salvation of its audience (and in their tendency to allow playful depictions of vice to eclipse those concerns), they differed in that they believed that the theology promoted by pre-Reformation plays was antithetical to salvation. Thus, a major shift in focus, from concern for the individual's moral behaviour to concern for the individual's theological practices, occurred with the post-Reformation morality plays. The wave of Protestantism which fuelled the content of these plays dictated that more attention should be given to warning people against the Catholic Church than of their sinful nature. The means of redemption, according to the philosophy embedded in post-Reformation morality plays, is dependent upon the audience understanding the truthfulness of Protestant theology and verses and also the deceptiveness and wickedness of Catholic theology, whose best example is the secular play of Calder\u00f3n.\nThe Vices in post-Reformation morality plays are sometimes depicted as being Catholic. At times this depiction is achieved through their physical appearance. For example, Vices in post-Reformation morality plays could be dressed as cardinals, friars, monks, or the pope. Other times, the Vice comes out and states he is a Catholic, or elucidates that he is Catholic by swearing a Catholic pledge. To deceive the victim of post-Reformation morality plays, the Vice typically assumes a new name to disguise what actual Vice he is.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography"}

One of the most notable examples during the Spanish-American War is the defense provided by the Moron-Jucardo Trocha. The trocha (or trench) stretched for fifty miles between the cities of Moron and Jucardo. Within this trench, and in addition to fallen trees, barbed wire was used. The barbed wire was arranged in a cat\u2019s cradle formation that for every 12 yards of barbed fence built, 420 yards of barbed wire was strung (or 35 yards of wire per yard of fence).\nLater versions of this type of barbed wire were manufactured by Germany during World War I. The reason for this was a wartime shortage of wire to make conventional barbed wire. Therefore, flat wire with triangular cutting edges began to be punched out of steel strips (\"band barbed wire\"). A welcome side effect was that a comparable length of barbed wire of this new type could be produced in less time. These precursors to NATO wire did not yet have an inner wire for stabilization, were therefore easy to cut with tin snips, and were also not as robust as normal barbed wire. However, they withstood the wire cutters used at the time to cut normal barbed wire, as was common at the front.\nAn article in a 1918 issue of \"The Hardware Trade Journal\" tells the story under the headline: \"This Cruel War\u2019s Abuse of Our Old Friend \u2018Bob Wire.'\" After describing Glidden and his invention, the article goes on as follows: \"Quite naturally some animals enclosed by Glidden\u2019s fencing gashed themselves on the barbs. Just as naturally, men and boys tried to climb over or under those fences and had their clothes and flesh torn...These wounds upon man and beast and the suddenness with which Glidden\u2019s barbs halted all living things came to the attention of military men, and the barbed wire entanglement of which we now read almost every day in the war news was born...And it may be said right here that soldiers who have been halted by wire entanglements while making a charge say the devil never invented anything nastier.\"\nDue to its dangerous nature, razor wire/barbed tape and similar fencing/barrier materials are prohibited in some locales. Norway prohibits any barbed wire except in combination with other fencing, in order to protect domesticated animals from exposure.\nConstruction.\nRazor wire has a central strand of high tensile strength wire, and a steel tape punched into a shape with barbs. The steel tape is then cold-crimped tightly to the wire everywhere except for the barbs. Flat barbed tape is very similar, but has no central reinforcement wire. The process of combining the two is called roll forming.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is composed largely of the magnesium-rich mineral talc. It is produced by dynamothermal metamorphism and metasomatism, which occur in subduction zones, changing rocks by heat and pressure, with influx of fluids but without melting. It has been a carving medium for thousands of years.\nTerminology.\nThe definitions of the terms \"steatite\" and \"soapstone\" vary with the field of study. In geology, steatite is a rock that is, to a very large extent, composed of talc. The mining industry defines steatite as a high-purity talc rock that is suitable for the manufacturing of, for example, insulators; the lesser grades of the mineral can be called simply \"talc rock\". Steatite can be used both in lumps (\"block steatite\", \"lava steatite\", \"lava grade talc\"), and in the ground form. While the geologists logically will use \"steatite\" to designate both forms, in the industry, \"steatite\" without additional qualifications typically means the steatite that is either already ground or to be used in the ground form in the future. If the ground steatite is pressed together into blocks, these are called \"synthetic block steatite\", \"artificial block steatite\", or \"artificial lava talc\".\nIn industrial applications \"soapstone\" refers to dimension stone that consists of either amphibole-chlorite-carbonate-talc rock, talc-carbonate rock, or simply talc rock and is sold in the form of sawn slabs. \"Ground soapstone\" sometimes designates the ground waste product of the slab manufacturing.\nPetrology.\nPetrologically, soapstone is composed predominantly of talc, with varying amounts of chlorite and amphiboles (typically tremolite, anthophyllite, and cummingtonite, hence its obsolete name, magnesiocummingtonite), and traces of minor iron-chromium oxides. It may be schistose or massive. Soapstone is formed by the metamorphism of ultramafic protoliths (e.g. dunite or serpentinite) and the metasomatism of siliceous dolomites.\nBy mass, \"pure\" steatite is roughly 63% silica, 32% magnesia, and 5% water. It commonly contains minor quantities of other oxides such as CaO or Al2O3.\nPyrophyllite, a mineral very similar to talc, is sometimes called soapstone in the generic sense, since its physical characteristics and industrial uses are similar, and because it is also commonly used as a carving material. However, this mineral typically does not have as soapy a feel as soapstone.\nPhysical characteristics.\nSoapstone is relatively soft because of its high proportion of talc, which has a definitional value of 1 on the Mohs hardness scale. Softer grades may feel similar to soap when touched, hence the name. The hardness of soapstone varies due to its varying talc content, from as little as 30% for architectural grades such as those used on countertops, to as much as 80% for carving grades.\nSoapstone is easy to carve; it is also durable and heat-resistant and has a high heat storage capacity. It has therefore been used for cooking and heating equipment for thousands of years.\nSoapstone is often used as an insulator for housing and electrical components, due to its durability and electrical characteristics and because it can be pressed into complex shapes before firing. Soapstone undergoes transformations when heated to temperatures of into enstatite and cristobalite; on the Mohs scale, this corresponds to an increase in hardness to 5.5\u20136.5. The resulting material, harder than glass, is sometimes called \"lava\".\nHistorical use.\nAfrica.\nAncient Egyptian scarab signets and amulets were most commonly made from glazed steatite. The Yoruba people of West Nigeria used soapstone for several statues, most notably at Esie, where archaeologists have uncovered hundreds of male and female statues about half of life size. The Yoruba of Ife also produced a miniature soapstone obelisk with metal studs called \"the staff of Oranmiyan\".\nSoapstone mining in Tabaka, Kenya occurs in relatively shallow and accessible quarries in the surrounding areas of Sameta, Nyabigege and Bomware. These were at the time open to all to access provided they had the labor resources to do so. This mostly meant the men did the mining as they were custodian to the community land, meaning ancestral lands in Riamosioma, Itumbe, Nyatike etc.\nAmericas.\nNative Americans have used soapstone since the Late Archaic period. During the Archaic archaeological period (8000\u20131000 BC), bowls, cooking slabs, and other objects were made from soapstone. The use of soapstone cooking vessels during this period has been attributed to the rock's thermal qualities; compared to clay or metal containers, soapstone retains heat more effectively. Use of soapstone in native American cultures continues to the modern day. Later, other cultures carved soapstone smoking pipes, a practice that continues today. The soapstone's low heat conduction allows for prolonged smoking without the pipe heating up uncomfortably.\nIndigenous peoples of the Arctic have traditionally used soapstone for carvings of both practical objects and art. The qulliq, a type of oil lamp, is carved out of soapstone and used by the Inuit and Dorset peoples. The soapstone oil lamps indicate these people had easy access to oils derived from marine mammals.\nIn the modern period, soapstone is commonly used for carvings in Inuit art.\nIn the United States, locally quarried soapstone was used for gravemarkers in 19th century northeast Georgia, around Dahlonega, and Cleveland as simple field stone and \"slot and tab\" tombs.\nIn Canada, soapstone was quarried in the Arctic regions like the western part of the Ungava Bay and the Appalachian Mountain System from Newfoundland.\nAsia.\nThe ancient trading city of Tepe Yahya in southeastern Iran was a center for the production and distribution of soapstone in the 5th to 3rd millennia BC.\nSoapstone has been used in India as a medium for sculptures since at least the time of the Hoysala Empire, the Western Chalukya Empire and to an extent Vijayanagara Empire.\nEven earlier, steatite was used as the substrate for Indus-Harappan seals. After the intricate carvings of icons and (yet undeciphered) symbols, the seals were heated above for several days to make them hard and durable to make the final seals used for making impressions on clay.\nIn China, during the Spring and Autumn period (771\u2013476 BC), soapstone was carved into ceremonial knives. Soapstone was also used to carve Chinese seals.\nSoapstone was used as a writing pencil in Myanmar as early as the 11th-century Pagan period. After that, it was still used as a pencil to write on Black Parabaik until the end of the Mandalay period (19th century).\nAustralia.\nPipes and decorative carvings of local animals were made out of soapstone by Australian Aboriginal artist Erlikilyika (c.\u20091865\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091930) in Central Australia.\nEurope.\nThe Minoan civilization on Crete used soapstone. At the Palace of Knossos, a steatite libation table was found. Soapstone is relatively abundant in northern Europe. During the Viking Age, soapstone was the primary cooking vessel material in Norway. Vikings hewed soapstone directly from the stone face, shaped it into cooking pots, and sold these at home and abroad. In Shetland, there is evidence that these vessels were used for processing marine and dairy fats. Several surviving medieval buildings in northern Europe are constructed with soapstone, amongst them Nidaros Cathedral.\nModern use.\nIn modern times, soapstone is most commonly used for architectural applications, such as counter tops, floor tiles, showerbases, and interior surfacing.\nSoapstone is sometimes used for construction of fireplace surrounds, cladding on wood-burning stoves, and as the preferred material for woodburning masonry heaters because it can absorb, store, and evenly radiate heat due to its high density and magnesite (MgCO3) content. It is also used for countertops and bathroom tiling because of the ease of working the material and its property as the \"quiet stone\". A weathered or aged appearance occurs naturally over time as the patina is enhanced.\nSoapstone can be used to create molds for casting objects from soft metals, such as pewter or silver. The soft stone is easily carved and is not degraded by heating. The slick surface of soapstone allows the finished object to be easily removed.\nWelders and fabricators use soapstone as a marker due to its resistance to heat; it remains visible when heat is applied. It has also been used for many years by seamstresses, carpenters, and other craftspeople as a marking tool, because its marks are visible but not permanent.\nResistance to heat made steatite suitable for manufacturing gas burner tips, spark plugs, and electrical switchboards.\nCeramics.\nSteatite ceramics are low-cost biaxial porcelains of nominal composition (MgO)3(SiO2)4. Steatite is used primarily for its dielectric and thermally-insulating properties in applications such as tile, substrates, washers, bushings, beads, and pigments. It is also used for high-voltage insulators, which have to stand large mechanical loads, such as insulators of mast radiators.\nCrafts.\nSoapstone continues to be used for carvings and sculptures by artists and indigenous peoples. In Brazil, especially in the state of Minas Gerais, the abundance of soapstone mines allow local artisans to craft pots, pans, wine glasses, statues, jewel boxes, coasters, and vases from soapstone. These handicrafts are commonly sold in street markets found in cities across the state. Some of the oldest towns, notably Congonhas, Tiradentes, and Ouro Preto, still have some of their streets paved with soapstone from colonial times.\nMining.\nArchitectural soapstone is mined in Canada, Brazil, India, and Finland and imported into the United States. Active North American mines include one south of Quebec City with products marketed by Canadian Soapstone, the Treasure and Regal mines in Beaverhead County, Montana mined by the Barretts Minerals Company, and another in central Virginia operated by the Alberene Soapstone Company.\nMining to meet worldwide demand for soapstone is threatening the habitat of India's tigers.\nOther.\nSoapstones can be put in a freezer and later used in place of ice cubes to chill alcoholic beverages without diluting. Sometimes called whiskey stones, these were introduced around 2007. Most whiskey stones feature a semipolished finish, retaining the soft look of natural soapstone, while others are highly polished.\nSafety.\nPeople can be exposed to soapstone dust in the workplace via inhalation and skin or eye contact. Exposure above safe limits can lead to symptoms including coughing, shortness of breath, cyanosis, crackles, and pulmonary heart disease. Due to the potential presence of tremolite and crystalline silica in the dust, precautions should be taken to avoid occupational diseases such as asbestosis, silicosis, mesothelioma, and lung cancer.\nUnited States.\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for soapstone exposure in the workplace as 20 million particles per cubic foot over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit of 6\u00a0mg/m3 total exposure and 3\u00a0mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 3000\u00a0mg/m3, soapstone is immediately dangerous to life and health.\nOther names.\nThe local names for the soapstone vary: in Vermont, \"grit\" is used, in Georgia \"white-grinding\" and \"dark-grinding\" varieties are distinguished, and California has \"soft\", \"hard\", and \"blue\" talc.

{"id": "44719", "revid": "50805212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44719", "title": "Judge", "text": "Official who presides over court proceedings\nA judge is a person who presides over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a judicial panel. In an adversarial system, the judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers or solicitors of the case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues a ruling in the case based on their interpretation of the law and their own personal judgment. A judge is expected to conduct the trial impartially and, typically, in an open court.\nThe powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may be shared with a jury. In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation, a judge might also be an examining magistrate. The presiding judge ensures that all court proceedings are lawful and orderly.\nPowers and functions.\nThe ultimate task of a judge is to settle a legal dispute in a final and publicly lawful manner in agreement with substantial partialities. Judges exercise significant governmental power. They can order police, military, or judicial officials to carry out searches, arrests, imprisonments, garnishments, detentions, seizures, deportations, and similar actions. However, judges also supervise trial procedures to ensure consistency and impartiality and to prevent arbitrariness. A judge\u2019s powers are checked by higher courts, such as courts of appeal and supreme courts.\nThe court usually has three main legally trained court officials: the judge, the prosecutor and the defence attorney. The role of a judge can vary between legal systems. In an adversarial system (common law), as in effect in the U.S. and England, the judge functions as an impartial referee, mainly ensuring correct procedure, while the prosecution and the defense present their case to a jury, often selected from common citizens. The main factfinder is the jury, and the judge will then finalize sentencing. Nevertheless, in smaller cases judges can issue summary judgments without proceeding to a jury trial. In an inquisitorial system (civil law), as in effect in continental Europe, there is no jury and the main factfinder is the judge, who will do the presiding, judging and sentencing on their own. As such, the judge is expected to apply the law directly, as in the French expression \"Le juge est la bouche de la loi\" (\"The judge is the mouth of the law\"). Furthermore, in some systems even investigations may be conducted by the judge, functioning as an examining magistrate.\nJudges may work alone in smaller cases, but in criminal, family and other significant cases, they work in a panel. In some civil law systems, this panel may include lay judges. Unlike professional judges, lay judges are not legally trained, but unlike jurors, lay judges are usually volunteers and may be politically appointed. Judges are often assisted by law clerks, referendaries and notaries in legal cases and by bailiffs or similar with security.\nRequirements and appointment.\nThere are both volunteer and professional judges. A volunteer judge, such as an English magistrate, is not required to have legal training and is unpaid. Whereas, a professional judge is required to be legally educated; in the U.S., this generally requires a degree of Juris Doctor. Furthermore, significant professional experience is often required; for example, in the U.S., judges are often appointed from experienced attorneys. Judges are often appointed by the head of state. However in some jurisdictions, judges are elected in a political election.\nImpartiality is often considered important for rule of law. Thus, in many jurisdictions judges may be appointed for life, so that they cannot be removed by the executive. However, in non-democratic systems, the appointment of judges may be highly politicized and they often receive instructions on how to judge, and may be removed if their conduct does not please the political leadership.\nJudge as an occupation.\nJudges must be able to research and process extensive lengths of documents, witness testimonies, and other case material, understand complex cases and possess a thorough understanding of the law and legal procedure, which requires excellent skills in logical reasoning, analysis and decision-making. Excellent writing skills are also a necessity, given the finality and authority of the documents written. Judges work with people all the time; by the nature of the job, good dispute resolution and interpersonal skills are a necessity. Judges are required to have good moral character, i.e. there must be no history of crime. Professional judges often enjoy a high salary, in the U.S. the median salary of judges is $101,690 per annum, and federal judges earn $208,000\u2013$267,000 per annum.\nGender effects.\nIn many civil law countries in Europe the majority of judges are women: in 6 countries (Slovenia, Serbia, Latvia, Luxembourg, Greece and Hungary) women make more than 70% of judges of the first instance. In contrast, in common law countries (UK, Ireland, Malta and the United States) the situation is reverse: over 70% of judges of the first instance are men.\nOn the other hand, women are underrepresented in the supreme courts of the United States and European Union member-states, except for in Romania, where over 80% of the judges of the High Court of Cassation and Justice are women.\nAge and retirement.\nIn the United States, federal judges are appointed \"for good behavior\", which means in practice, that federal judges work until they die, voluntarily retire or are impeached. The death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the office in 2020 and suspension of Pauline Newman in 2023 reinvigorated the discussion about mandatory retirement age for federal judges, but such change would require a constitutional amendment and is unlikely to be implemented soon.\nStates have more flexibility in establishing a mandatory retirement age for judges, as was confirmed by the SCOTUS in its 1991 decision Gregory v. Ashcroft. As of 2015, 33 States and the District of Columbia had mandatory retirement ages for State court judges, which ranged from 70 to 75 for most (but is as high as 90 in Vermont).\nA 2020 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found significant positive effects on the performance of state Supreme Courts with mandatory retirement age for judges. The authors advocated the adoption of mandatory retirement ages for all federal and state judges, although they felt, that the individual authorities should decide on the specific age for themselves.\nSymbols of office.\nA variety of traditions have become associated with the rank or occupation. Gavels (a ceremonial hammer) are used by judges in many countries, to the point that the gavel has become a symbol of a judge. In many parts of the world, judges wear long robes (often in black or red) and sit on an elevated platform during trials (known as the bench).\nAmerican judges frequently wear black robes. American judges have ceremonial gavels, although American judges have court deputies or bailiffs and \"contempt of court\" power as their main devices to maintain decorum in the courtroom. However, in some of the Western United States, like California, judges did not always wear robes and instead wore everyday clothing. Today, some members of state supreme courts, such as the Maryland Supreme Court wear distinct dress. In Italy and Portugal, both judges and lawyers wear particular black robes.\nIn some countries, especially in the Commonwealth of Nations, judges wear wigs. The long wig often associated with judges is now reserved for ceremonial occasions, although it was part of the standard attire in previous centuries. A short wig resembling but not identical to a barrister's wig (a Bench Wig) would be worn in court. This tradition, however, is being phased out in Britain in non-criminal courts.\nIn Oman, the judge wears a long stripe (red, green white), while the attorneys wear the black gown.\nIn Portugal and in the former Portuguese Empire, the judges used to carry a staff that was red for ordinary judges and white for the judges from the outside.\nTitles and forms of address.\nAsia.\nHong Kong.\nIn Hong Kong, court proceedings are conducted in either English or Hong Kong Cantonese (a dialect of Yue Chinese). Judges of Hong Kong retain many of the English traditions such as wearing wigs and robes in trials.\nIn the lower courts, magistrates are addressed as \"Your worship\", and district court judges as \"Your Honour\".\nIn the superior courts of record, namely the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal and the High Court of Hong Kong (which consists of the Court of Appeal and the Court of First Instance), judges are addressed as \"My Lord\" or \"My Lady\" and referred to as \"Your Lordship\" or \"Your Ladyship\", following the English tradition.\nIn writing, the post-nominal letters \"PJ\" is used to refer to a permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal and \"NPJ\" to a non-permanent judge. In the High Court, the abbreviation \"JA\" is used to denote a justice of appeal, and the letter \"J\" refers to a judge of the Court of First Instance.\nMasters of the High Court are addressed as \"Master\".\nWhen trials are conducted in Chinese, judges were addressed, in Cantonese, as \"Fat Goon Dai Yan\" () before the transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China, and as \"Fat Goon Gok Ha\" () since 1997. \"Fat Goon\" () means the word \"judge\".\nIndia.\nIn India, judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts were addressed as \"Your Lordship\" or \"My Lord\" and \"Your Ladyship\" or \"My Lady\", a tradition directly attributable to England. The Bar Council of India had adopted a resolution in April 2006 and added a new Rule 49(1)(j) in the Advocates Act. As per the rule, lawyers can address the court as \"Your Honour\" and refer to it as \"Honourable Court\". If it is a subordinate court, lawyers can use terms such as \"sir\" or any equivalent phrase in the regional language concerned. Explaining the rationale behind the move, the Bar Council had held that the words such as \"My Lord\" and \"Your Lordship\" were \"relics of the colonial past\". The resolution has since been circulated to all state councils and the Supreme Court for adoption but over five years now, the resolution largely remained on paper.\nHowever, in an unprecedented move in October 2009, one of the judges of Madras HC, Justice K Chandru had banned lawyers from addressing his court as \"My Lord\" and \"Your Lordship\".\nIsrael.\nIn Israel, the judges () of all courts are addressed as \"Sir\", \"Madam\" () or \"Your Honor\" (). Typically after every naming you will hear \"haShof\u00e9t\", meaning \"the judge\" after the respective address. For example, \"Your Honor the Judge\" would be (\"kevod haShof\u00e9t\").\nKazakh Khanate.\nBiy - elected judges using adat Zheti Zhargy. The Council of biys was the highest council, a kind of senate.\nMalaysia.\nIn Malaysia, judges of the subordinate courts are addressed as \"Tuan\" or \"Puan\" (\"Sir\", \"Madam\"), or \"Your Honour\". Judges of the superior courts are addressed as \"Yang Arif\" (lit.\u2009'Learned One') or \"My Lord\", \"My Lady\", etc.; and \"Your Lordship\" or \"My Ladyship\" if the proceedings, as they generally are in the superior courts, are in English.\nPakistan.\nIn Pakistan, judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts are addressed as \"Your Lordship\" or \"My Lord\" or \"Lordship\" and \"Your Ladyship\" or \"My Lady\", a tradition directly attributable to England. There is some resistance to this on religious grounds but more or less continues till this day. In lower courts, judges are addressed as \"sir\", \"madam\" or the Urdu equivalent \"Janab\" or \"Judge Sahab\".\nSri Lanka.\nIn Sri Lanka, judges of most courts are addressed as \"Your Honour\"; however, the Chief Justice is addressed as \"Your Lordship\". Judges of the Supreme Court and the Appeal Court receives the title \"The Honourable\".\nVietnam.\nJudges in Vietnam are addressed as \"\" (literally the \"Honorable Court\").\nEurope.\nBulgaria.\nIn Bulgaria before 1989, during the communist regime, judges were addressed as \"drugarju\" (). After 1989, \"gospod\u00edn s\u016ddiya\" () or \"gospo\u017eo s\u016ddiya\" () are used.\nFinland.\nThere is no special form of address; ordinary politeness is sufficient and the procedure lacks arcane rituals. Accordingly, the chairman of the panel is addressed as \"herra/rouva puheenjohtaja\" (\"Mr./Ms. Chairman\"). Finnish judges use gavels, but there are no robes or cloaks used in any Finnish courts.\nIn a district court (\"k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus\"), ordinary judges work with the title \"k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4tuomari\" and the chairman is \"laamanni\" (lawspeaker). They are assisted by notaries (\"notaari\"), assessors (\"asessori\") and referendaries (\"viskaali\") who may sometimes even chair sessions. In appeals courts (\"hovioikeus\") an ordinary judge has the title \"hovioikeudenneuvos\", the chairman of a section is \"hovioikeudenlaamanni\" and the court is led by a \"presidentti\". In the Supreme Court, judges are titled \"oikeusneuvos\" and the court is led by a \"presidentti\".\nFrance.\nIn France, the presiding judge of a court is addressed as \"Monsieur le pr\u00e9sident\" or \"Madame le pr\u00e9sident\", whilst associated judges are addressed as \"Monsieur l'Assesseur\" or \"Madame l'Assesseur\". Out of the courtroom, judges are referred to as \"Monsieur le juge\" or \"Madame le juge\".\nGermany.\nIn Germany, judges are addressed as \"Herr Vorsitzender\" or \"Frau Vorsitzende\", which translate as \"Mister Chairman\" and \"Madam Chairwoman\", or as \"Hohes Gericht\", which translates as \"High Court\".\nHungary.\nThe male presiding judge of a court is addressed as \"tisztelt b\u00edr\u00f3 \u00far\", which means \"Honourable Mister Judge\" and a female presiding judge is addressed as \"tisztelt b\u00edr\u00f3n\u0151\", which means \"Honourable Madam Judge\". The court as a body can be addressed as \"tisztelt b\u00edr\u00f3s\u00e1g\", which means \"Honourable Court\".\nIreland.\nJudges of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, or High Court are officially titled \"The Honourable Mr/Mrs/Ms/Miss Justice Surname\" (), and informally referred to for short as \"Mr/Mrs/Ms/Miss Justice Surname\". In court, they are addressed either by their respective titles or styles, as \"The Court\" (\"An Ch\u00fairt\"), or simply \"Judge\" (\"A Bhreithimh\"). In law reports, the Chief Justice of Ireland has the postnominal \"CJ\", the Presidents of the other Courts have the postnominal \"P\", and all other judges \"J\", e.g. \"Smith J\".\nJudges of the Circuit Court are titled \"His/Her Honour Judge Surname\" and are addressed in Court as \"Judge\". Before 2006, they were addressed as \"My Lord\" (\"A thiarna\") .\nJudges of the District Court are titled \"Judge Surname\" and addressed in Court as \"Judge\". Before 1991 these judges were known as District Justices and addressed as \"Your Worship\" (\"d'On\u00f3ra\").\nItaly.\nIn Italy, the presiding judge of a court is addressed as \"Signor/Signora presidente della corte\" (Sir/Madame president of the court) or \"Vostro Onore\" (Your Honour).\nNetherlands.\nIn the Netherlands, presiding judges of either sex are, in writing only, addressed \"edelachtbare\" (\"Your Honour\") for judges in the Court of First Instance, \"edelgrootachtbare\" (\"Your Great Honour\") for justices in the Court of Appeal and \"edelhoogachtbare\" (\"Your High Honour\") for justices in the High Council of the Netherlands (Supreme Court).\nPoland.\nIn Poland, presiding judges of either sex during trial are addressed \"Wysoki S\u0105dzie\" (\"High Court\").\nPortugal.\nIn Portugal, presiding judges during trial are addressed as \"Meret\u00edssimo Juiz\" when a man or \"Meret\u00edssima Ju\u00edza\" when a woman (meaning \"Most Worthy Judge\") or as \"Vossa Excel\u00eancia\" (\"Your Excellency\") when not specifying gender.\nRomania.\nIn Romania, judges during trial are addressed as \"Onorata Instanta\" (Your Honor).\nRussia.\nIn Russia, \"Vasha Chest\" () is used for criminal cases only with the one judge presiding. For civil, commercial and criminal cases presided over by a panel of judges the right address is \"Honorable Court\".\nSpain.\nIn Spain, magistrates of the Supreme Court, magistrates and judges are addressed to as \"Your Lordship\" (\"Su Se\u00f1or\u00eda\"); however, in formal occasions, magistrates of the Supreme Court are addressed to as \"Your Most Excellent Lordship\" (\"Vuestra Se\u00f1or\u00eda Excelent\u00edsima\" or \"Excelent\u00edsimo Se\u00f1or\"/\"Excelent\u00edsima Se\u00f1ora\"); in those solemn occasions, magistrates of lower Courts are addressed as \"Your Most Illustrious Lordship\" (\"Vuestra Se\u00f1or\u00eda Ilustr\u00edsima\" or \"Ilustr\u00edsimo Se\u00f1or\"/\"Ilustr\u00edsima Se\u00f1ora\"); simple judges are always called \"Your Lordship\".\nSweden.\nIn Sweden, the presiding judge of a court is traditionally addressed as \"Herr Ordf\u00f6rande\" or \"Fru Ordf\u00f6rande\", which translate as \"Mister Chairman\" and \"Madam Chairwoman\".\nUnited Kingdom.\nEngland and Wales.\nIn the Courts of England and Wales, Supreme Court judges are called Justices of the Supreme Court. Justices of the Supreme Court who do not hold life peerages are now given the courtesy style \"Lord\" or \"Lady\". Justices of the Supreme Court are addressed as \"My Lord/Lady\" in court. In the law reports, the Justices of the Supreme Court are usually referred to as \"Lord/Lady N\", although the Weekly Law Reports appends the post-nominal letters \"JSC\" (e.g. \"Lady Smith JSC\"). The President and Deputy President of the Court are afforded the post-nominal letters PSC and DPSC respectively. Only experienced barristers or solicitors are usually appointed as judges.\nJudges of the High Court and Court of Appeal are addressed (when sitting in those courts) as \"My Lord\" or \"My Lady\" and referred to as \"Your Lordship\" or \"Your Ladyship\".\nJudges of the Court of Appeal, also called Lords Justice of Appeal, are referred to as \"Lord Justice N\" or \"Lady Justice N\". In legal writing, Lords Justices of Appeal are afforded the post nominal letters \"LJ\": for example, Smith LJ.\nWhen a Justice of the High Court who is not present is being referred to they are described as \"Mr./Mrs./Ms. Justice \"N.\"\" In legal writing, the post-nominal letter \"J\" is used to denote a Justice (male or female) of the High Court; for example, a Justice Smith is referred to as Smith J. Unlike American English, no comma is used to offset the letter J from the Justice's name. The full stop after the preceding examples terminates the sentence, not the abbreviation, and the abbreviation can be used mid-sentence in prose in formal legal writing. Masters of the High Court are addressed as \"Master\". Insolvency and Companies Court judges in the High Court are addressed as \"Judge\".\nCircuit judges and recorders are addressed as \"Your Honour\". Circuit judges are referred to as \"His/Her Honour Judge N\". In writing, this title is occasionally abbreviated as \"HHJ\" or \"HH Judge N\", but not in legal writing. District judges and tribunal judges are addressed as \"Judge\".\nMagistrates are usually still addressed as \"Your Worship\" in much of England. Magistrates are also addressed as \"Sir/Madam\".\nScotland.\nIn the Courts of Scotland judges in the Court of Session, High Court of Justiciary and the sheriff courts are all addressed as \"My Lord\" or \"My Lady\" and referred to as \"Your Lordship\" or \"Your Ladyship\".\nJustices of the peace in justice of the peace courts are addressed and referred to as \"Your Honour\".\nNorthern Ireland.\nThe judicial system of Northern Ireland is very similar to that of England and Wales, and superior court judges are addressed the same way as those in England and Wales. However, there are a few differences at the lower levels.\nIn Northern Ireland, the equivalent to a circuit judge is a county court judge, and they are addressed and titled the same way as a circuit judge is in England and Wales. The senior county court judges assigned to the county court divisions of Belfast and Derry have the titles of Recorder of Belfast and Recorder of Londonderry (or Derry) respectively, but are addressed the same as other county court judges. A district judge sitting in the County Court is addressed as \"Your Honour\".\nA district judge (magistrates' court) is addressed as \"Your Worship\". A lay magistrate, in cases where they are present, is also addressed as \"Your Worship\", and may use the post-nominals \"LM\", e.g. \"John Smith LM\".\nNorth America.\nCanada.\nIn general, Canadian judges may be addressed directly, depending on the province, as \"My Lord\", \"My Lady\", \"Your Honour\" or \"Justice\" and are formally referred to in the third person as \"The Honourable Mr. (or Madam) Justice 'Forename Surname'\". Less formally, judges of a Superior Court are referred to as \"Justice 'Surname'\", not as \"Judge 'Surname.'\" When referred to in a decision of a court, judges' titles are often abbreviated to the suffix \"J.\", so that Justice Smith will be referred to as Smith J. Judges in some superior courts are addressed as \"My Lord\" or \"My Lady\". In Ontario, judges are rarely referred to as \"My Lord\" or \"My Lady\", but only as \"Your Honour\" at the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Formerly, translations of these titles such as \"Votre Honneur\" (\"your honour\") or \"Votre Seigneurie\" (\"your lordship\") were used in French; today, only \"Monsieur le juge\" and \"Madame la juge\" are officially used. Both the titles \"judge\" and \"justice\" are translated \"juge\".\nGenerally, it is only appropriate to use the term \"judge\" when speaking of an anonymous or general position, such as \"the trial judge\", or when referring to a member of an inferior or provincial court such as the Ontario Court of Justice. The exception is Citizenship Judges who are referred to only as \"Judge 'Surname'\" in accordance with their appointment as independent decision makers of the Citizenship Commission.\nLike other members of the Commonwealth, a justice of the peace is addressed as \"Your Worship\", and a Master of a Superior Court is referred to as \"Master\". As of December 7, 2018, Ontario Court Masters are addressed in English as \"Your Honour\" and in French as \"Votre Honneur\" and no longer as \"Master\".\nUnited States.\nIn many states throughout the United States, a judge is addressed as \"Your Honor\" or \"Judge\" when presiding over the court. \"Judge\" may be more commonly used by attorneys and staff, while either may be commonly used by the plaintiff or defendant. Notably, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, the largest unified trial court in the United States, has a rule that the judge shall be addressed only as \"Your Honor\" while in court, and never as \"Judge\", \"Judge (name)\", \"ma'am\", or \"sir\". This is somewhat unusual as \"Judge\" and \"Judge (name)\" or similar forms of address are considered appropriate and respectful in many other courts.\nThe judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, and the judges of the supreme courts of several U.S. states and other countries are called \"justices\". Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States and Justices of other courts are addressed as \"Justice (name)\". The Chief Justice of the United States is formally addressed as \"Mr. or Madam Chief Justice\" but also may be identified and addressed as \"Chief Justice (name)\".\nRegardless of the specific term employed (judge or justice), the formal title is reduced to the postnominal abbreviation \"J.\" in case citations and certain case law reporters when it is necessary to identify the author of a cited opinion. In American English, the postnominal \"J.\" is always divided from the judge's name by a comma and a space, so that a citation to a dissenting opinion by Associate Justice Antonin Scalia would warn that the cited opinion is not the majority opinion with the parenthetical notation \"Scalia, J., dissenting\". The plural form is JJ. Unlike British English, this abbreviation style is used only in case citations, and is not used mid-sentence in regular prose (as distinguished from case citations dropped into sentences as parentheticals). Thus, a prose sentence discussing the actual contents of a dissenting opinion right before a case citation to that opinion would refer to the reasoning of \"Justice Scalia\", not \"Scalia, J.\"\nThe justices of the supreme courts usually hold higher offices than any other judges in a jurisdiction, including a justice of the peace, a judge who holds police court in some jurisdictions and who may also try small claims and misdemeanors. However, the State of New York inverts this usual order. The initial trial court in this state is called the Supreme Court of New York, and its judges are called \"justices\". The next highest appellate court is the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, whose judges are also called \"justices\". However, the highest court in New York is called the New York Court of Appeals, whose members are called \"judges\".\nJudges in certain jurisdictions, such as New York and New Jersey, who deal with guardianships, trusts and estates are known as \"surrogates\".\nA \"senior judge\", in American practice, is a retired judge who handles selected cases for a governmental entity while in retirement, on a part-time basis.\nSubordinate or inferior jurisdiction judges in American legal practice are sometimes called magistrates, although in the federal judiciary of the United States, they are called magistrate judges. Subordinate judges in American legal practice who are appointed on an \"ad hoc\" case-by-case basis, particularly in cases where a great deal of detailed and tedious evidence must be reviewed, are often called \"masters\" or \"special masters\".\nJudges of courts of specialized jurisdiction (such as bankruptcy courts or juvenile courts) were sometimes known officially as \"referees\", but the use of this title is in decline. Judges sitting in courts of equity in common law systems (such as judges in the equity courts of Delaware) are called \"chancellors\".\nIndividuals with judicial responsibilities who report to an executive branch official, rather than being a part of the judiciary, are often called \"administrative law judges\" (ALJs) in American practice. Historically, such officials were previously known as hearing examiners or referees before American English settled on the ALJ title. They commonly make initial determinations regarding matters such as workers' compensation, eligibility for government benefits, regulatory matters, and immigration determinations.\nJudges who derive their authority from a contractual agreement of the parties to a dispute, rather than a governmental body, are called arbitrators. They typically do not receive the honorific forms of address nor do they bear the symbolic trappings of a publicly appointed judge. However, it is now common for many retired judges to serve as arbitrators, and they will often write their names as if they were still judges, with the parenthetical \"(Ret.)\" for \"Retired\".\nUnlike many civil law countries which have some courts on which panels of judges with nearly equal status composed of both legally trained professional judges and lay judges who lack legal training and are not career judges, the United States legal system (like most Anglo-American legal systems) makes a clear distinction between professional judges and laypeople involved in deciding a case who are jurors who are part of a jury. Most but not all American judges have professional credentials as lawyers. Non-lawyer judges in the United States are often elected and are typically either justices of the peace or part-time judges in rural limited jurisdiction courts. A non-lawyer judge typically has the same rights and responsibilities as a lawyer who is a judge holding the same office and is addressed in the same manner.\nOceania.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia judges and, since 2007, magistrates, of all jurisdictions including the High Court of Australia are now addressed as \"Your Honour\". In legal contexts, they are referred to as \"His/Her Honour\" and \"the Honourable Justice Surname\" (for judges of superior courts) or \"his/her Honour Judge Surname\" (for inferior courts). Outside legal contexts, the formal terms of address are \"Judge\" (for puisne justices) or \"Chief Justice\" (for chief justices).\nThe title for most puisne judges is \"Justice\", which is abbreviated in law reports to a postnominal \"J\", in the form \"Surname J\". Chief Justices of the High Court and of state Supreme Courts are titled \"Chief Justice\", which is abbreviated in law reports to a postnomial \"CJ\". Judges in State Supreme Courts with a separate Court of Appeal division (New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia) are referred to as Justices/Judges of the Appeal (abbreviated \"Surname JA\"), while the President of the Court of Appeal is referred to as \"President\" (abbreviated \"Surname P\").\nNew Zealand.\nIn New Zealand, judges of the District Court of New Zealand generally referred to as \"His/Her Honour\" or \"Sir/Madame\". Judges from the High Court, Appeals Court, and Supreme Court are referred to as \"Justice [Surname]\". In social settings, it is appropriate to use \"Judge\" in all cases.\nSouth America.\nBrazil.\nIn Brazil, judges are simply called \"Juiz\" or \"Ju\u00edza\" (male and female forms of \"judge\") and traditionally addressed to as \"Vossa Excel\u00eancia\" (lit.\u2009'Your Excellency', translated as 'Your Honor') or \"Merit\u00edssimo\" ('Honorable', but it is used as a pronoun also translated as 'Your Honor'). Judges that are part of a panel in a State Court, or Federal Court are called \"desembargadores\". Judges sitting in the higher courts (Supremo Tribunal Federal, Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a, Tribunal Superior do Trabalho, Superior Tribunal Militar and Tribunal Superior Eleitoral) are called \"ministro\" or \"ministra\" (male and female forms of \"minister\") and also referred to as \"Vossa Excel\u00eancia\".\nInternational courts.\nAt the International Court of Justice, judges may be addressed by the titles they received in their countries of origin.\nJudges of the International Criminal Court are referred to as \"judge\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44720", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44720", "title": "Jury", "text": "Group of people to render a verdict in a court\n \nA jury is a sworn body of people (jurors) convened to hear evidence, make findings of fact, and render an impartial verdict officially submitted to them by a court, or to set a penalty or judgment. Most trial juries are \"petit juries\", and consist of up to 15 people. A larger jury known as a grand jury has been used to investigate potential crimes and render indictments against suspects, and consists of between 16 and 23 jurors.\nThe jury system developed in England during the Middle Ages and is a hallmark of the English common law system. Juries are commonly used in countries whose legal systems derive from the British Empire, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Ireland. They are not used in most other countries, whose legal systems are based upon European civil law or Islamic sharia law, although their use has been spreading. Instead, typically guilt is determined by a single person, usually a professional judge. Civil law systems that do not use juries may use lay judges instead.\nThe word \"jury\" has also been applied to randomly-selected bodies with other purposes, such as policy juries.\nTypes of jury.\nThe \"petit jury\" (or \"trial jury\", sometimes \"petty jury\") hears the evidence in a trial as presented by both the plaintiff (petitioner) and the defendant (respondent) (also known as the complainant and defendant within the English criminal legal system). After hearing the evidence and often jury instructions from the judge, the group retires for deliberation, to consider a verdict. The majority required for a verdict varies. In some cases it must be unanimous, while in other jurisdictions it may be a majority or supermajority. A jury that is unable to come to a verdict is referred to as a hung jury.\nGrand jury.\nA grand jury, a type of jury now confined mostly to federal courts and some state jurisdictions in the United States and Liberia, determines whether there is enough evidence for a criminal trial to go forward. Grand juries carry out this duty by examining evidence presented to them by a prosecutor and issuing indictments, or by investigating alleged crimes and issuing presentments. Grand juries are usually larger than trial juries: for example, U.S. federal grand juries have between 16 and 23 members. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees Americans the constitutional right to be free from charges for \"capital, or otherwise infamous\" crimes unless they have been indicted by a grand jury, although this right applies only to federal law, not state law.\nIn addition to their primary role in screening criminal prosecutions and assisting in the investigation of crimes, grand juries in California, Florida, and some other U.S. states are sometimes utilized to perform an investigative and policy audit function similar to that filled by the Government Accountability Office in the United States federal government and legislative state auditors in many U.S. states.\nIn Ireland and other countries in the past, the task of a grand jury was to determine whether the prosecutors had presented a \"true bill\" (one that described a crime and gave a plausible reason for accusing the named person).\nCoroner's jury.\nAnother kind of jury, known as a coroner's jury can be convened in some common law jurisdiction in connection with an inquest by a coroner. A coroner is a public official (often an elected local government official in the United States), who is charged with determining the circumstances leading to a death in ambiguous or suspicious cases. A coroner's jury is generally a body that a coroner can convene on an optional basis in order to increase public confidence in the coroner's finding where there might otherwise be a controversy. In practice, coroner's juries are most often convened in order to avoid the appearance of impropriety by one governmental official in the criminal justice system toward another if no charges are filed against the person causing the death, when a governmental party such as a law enforcement officer is involved in the death.\nAdvisory jury.\nAn advisory jury is a non-binding jury empaneled by a judge to provide an opinion on factual issues during a trial. Unlike ordinary juries, whose verdicts are binding, an advisory jury\u2019s findings serve only to inform the judge, who remains the final arbiter of fact and law. In the United States federal courts, advisory juries may be used in actions \u201cnot triable of right by a jury\u201d under Rule 39(c)(1). When an advisory jury is used, the court must make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law separately, as required by Rule 52. The practice originated in the English Court of Chancery, where factual issues were sometimes referred to common law courts for a jury\u2019s opinion, a procedure later known as the \"feigned issue\".\nHistorical roots.\nThe modern jury evolved out of the ancient custom of many ancient Germanic tribes whereby a group of men of certain social standing was used to investigate crimes and judge the accused. The same custom evolved into the vehmic court system in medieval Germany. In Anglo-Saxon England, juries investigated crimes. After the Norman Conquest, some parts of the country preserved juries as the means of investigating crimes. The use of ordinary members of the community to consider crimes was unusual in ancient cultures, but was nonetheless also found in ancient Greece.\nThe modern jury trial evolved out of this custom in the mid-12th century during the reign of Henry II. Juries, usually 6 or 12 men, were an \"ancient institution\" even then in some parts of England, at the same time as Members consisted of representatives of the basic units of local government\u2014\"hundreds\" (an administrative sub-division of the shire, embracing several vills) and villages. Called juries of presentment, these men testified under oath to crimes committed in their neighbourhood. The Assize of Clarendon in 1166 caused these juries to be adopted systematically throughout the country. The jury in this period was \"self-informing,\" meaning it heard very little evidence or testimony in court. Instead, jurors were recruited from the locality of the dispute and were expected to know the facts before coming to court. The source of juror knowledge could include first-hand knowledge, investigation, and less reliable sources such as rumour and hearsay.\nBetween 1166 and 1179 new procedures including a division of functions between the sheriff, the jury of local men, and the royal justices ushered in the era of the English Common Law. Sheriffs prepared cases for trial and found jurors with relevant knowledge and testimony. Jurors 'found' a verdict by witnessing as to fact, even assessing and applying information from their own and community memory\u2014little was written at this time and what was, such as deeds and writs, were subject to fraud. Royal justices supervised trials, answered questions as to law, and announced the court's decision which was then subject to appeal. Sheriffs executed the decision of the court. These procedures enabled Henry II to delegate authority without endowing his subordinates with too much power.:293\nIn 1215 the Catholic Church removed its sanction from all forms of the ordeal\u2014procedures by which suspects up to that time were 'tested' as to guilt (e.g., in the ordeal of hot metal, molten metal was sometimes poured into a suspected thief's hand. If the wound healed rapidly and well, it was believed God found the suspect innocent, and if not then the suspect was found guilty). With trial by ordeal banned, establishing guilt would have been problematic had England not had forty years of judicial experience. Justices were by then accustomed to asking jurors of presentment about points of fact in assessing indictments; it was a short step to ask jurors if they concluded the accused was guilty as charged.:358\nThe so-called Wantage Code provides an early reference to a jury-like group in England, wherein a decree issued by King \u00c6thelred the Unready (at Wantage, c. 997) provided that in every Hundred \"the twelve leading thegns together with the reeve shall go out and swear on the relics which are given into their hands, that they will not accuse any innocent man nor shield a guilty one.\" The resulting Wantage Code formally recognized legal customs that were part of the Danelaw.\nThe testimonial concept can also be traced to Normandy before 1066, when a jury of nobles was established to decide land disputes. In this manner, the Duke, being the largest land owner, could not act as a judge in his own case.\nOne of the earliest antecedents of modern jury systems is the jury in ancient Greece, including the city-state of Athens, where records of jury courts date back to 500 BCE. These juries voted by secret ballot and were eventually granted the power to annul unconstitutional laws, thus introducing the practice of judicial review. In modern justice systems, the law is considered \"self-contained\" and \"distinct from other coercive forces, and perceived as separate from the political life of the community,\" but \"all these barriers are absent in the context of classical Athens. In practice and in conception the law and its administration are in some important respects indistinguishable from the life of the community in general.\"\nIn juries of the Justices in Eyre, the bailiff of the hundred would choose 4 electors who in turn chose 12 others from their hundred, and from these were selected 12 jurors.\n17th-18th century.\nFrom the 17th century until 1898 in Ireland, Grand Juries also functioned as local government authorities. \nIn 1730, the British Parliament passed the Bill for Better Regulation of Juries. The Act stipulated that the list of all those liable for jury service was to be posted in each parish and that jury panels would be selected by lot, also known as sortition, from these lists. Its aim was to prevent middle-class citizens from evading their responsibilities by financially putting into question the neutrality of the under-sheriff, the official entrusted with impaneling juries. Prior to the Act, the main means of ensuring impartiality was by allowing legal challenges to the sheriff's choices. The new provisions did not specifically aim at establishing impartiality but had the effect of reinforcing the authority of the jury by guaranteeing impartiality at the point of selection.\nIn some American colonies (such as in New England and Virginia) and less often in England, juries also handed down rulings on the law in addition to rulings on the facts of the case. The American grand jury was also indispensable to the American Revolution by challenging the Crown and Parliament, including by indicting British soldiers, refusing to indict people who criticized the crown, proposing boycotts and called for the support of the war after the Declaration of Independence.\nIn the late 18th century, English and colonial civil, criminal and grand juries played major roles in checking the power of the executive, the legislature and the judiciary.\n19th century.\nIn 1825, the rules concerning juror selection in England were consolidated. Property qualifications and various other rules were standardised, although an exemption was left open for towns which \"possessed\" their own courts. This reflected a more general understanding that local officials retained a large amount of discretion regarding which people they actually summoned. In the late eighteenth century, King has found evidence of butchers being excluded from service in Essex; while Crosby has found evidence of \"peripatetic ice cream vendors\" not being summoned in the summer time as late as 1923.\nWith the adoption of the Juries Act (Ireland) 1871, property qualifications for Irish jurors were partially standardized and lowered, so that jurors were drawn from among men who paid above a certain amount of taxes for poor relief. This expanded the number of potential jurors, even though only a small minority of Irish people were eligible to serve.\nUntil the 1870s, jurors in England and Ireland worked under the rule that they could not leave, eat, drink, or have a fire to warm themselves by, though they could take medicine. This rule appears to have been imposed with the idea that hungry jurors would be quicker to compromise, so they could reach a verdict and therefore eat. Jurors who broke the rule by smuggling in food were sometimes fined, and occasionally, especially if the food were believed to come from one of the parties in the case, the verdict was quashed. Later in the century, jurors who did not reach a verdict on the first day were no longer required to sleep in the courthouse, but were sometimes put up, at the expense of the parties in the trial, at a hotel.\n20th century.\nAfter 1919 in England, women were no longer excluded from jury service by virtue of their sex, although they still had to satisfy the ordinary property qualifications. The exemption which had been created by the 1825 Act for towns which \"possessed\" their own courts meant ten towns were free to ignore the property qualifications. This amplified in these towns the general understanding that local officials had a free hand in summoning freely from among those people who were qualified to be jurors. In 1920, three of these ten towns \u2013 Leicester, Lincoln, and Nottingham \u2013 consistently empanelled assize juries of six men and six women; while at the Bristol, Exeter, and Norwich assizes no women were empanelled at all. This quickly led to a tightening up of the rules, and an abolition of these ten towns' discretion. After 1922, trial juries throughout England had to satisfy the same qualifications; although it was not until the 1980s that a centralised system was designed for selecting jurors from among the people who were qualified to serve. This meant there was still a great amount of discretion in the hands of local officials.\nSummoning jurors.\nPotential jurors are summoned to the courthouse for service. In the past, jurors were identified manually, by local authorities making lists of men they believed to be eligible for service. In 19th-century Ireland, the list of eligible jurors in each court district was alphabetized, and in the later part of the century, the sheriff was required to summon one potential juror from each letter of the alphabet, repeating as needed until a sufficient number of men had been summoned, usually between 36 and 60 men for the quarterly assizes. Normally the sheriff or a constable went to each juror's home to show him the summons paperwork (\"venire facias de novo\"); it wasn't until 1871 that any Irish jurors could be summoned by mail. In modern times, juries are often initially chosen randomly, usually from large databases identifying the eligible population of adult citizens residing in the court's jurisdictional area (e.g., identity cards, drivers' licenses, tax records, or similar systems), and summons are delivered by mail. \nIn the past, qualifications included things like being an adult male, having a good reputation in the community, and owning land. Modern requirements may include being a citizen of that country and having a fluent understanding of the language used during the trial. In addition to a minimum age, some countries have a maximum age. Some countries disqualify people who have been previously convicted of a crime or excuse them on various grounds, such as being ill or holding certain jobs or offices. \nServing on a jury is normally compulsory for individuals who are qualified for jury service. Skipping service may be inevitable in a small number of cases, as a summoned juror might become ill or otherwise become unexpectedly unable to appear at the court. However, a significant fraction of summoned jurors may fail to appear for other reasons. In 1874, there was a report that one-third of summoned Irish jurors failed to appear in court.\nWhen an insufficient number of summoned jurors appear in court to handle a matter, the law in many jurisdictions empowers the jury commissioner or other official convening the jury to involuntarily impress bystanders in the vicinity of the place where the jury is to be convened to serve on the jury.\nTrial jury size.\nAs the concept of a jury was spread through the British Empire, first to Ireland and then to other countries, the size of the jury was one of the details that was adapted to the local culture. The tradition in England was to have twelve jurors, but other countries use smaller juries, and some, such as Scotland, use larger juries.\nThe size of the jury is to provide a \"cross-section\" of the public. In \"Williams v. Florida\", 399 U.S. https:// (1970), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that a Florida state jury of six was sufficient, that \"the 12-man panel is not a necessary ingredient of \"trial by jury,\" and that respondent's refusal to impanel more than the six members provided for by Florida law \"did not violate petitioner's Sixth Amendment rights as applied to the States through the Fourteenth.\" In \"Ballew v. Georgia\", 435 U.S. https:// (1978), the Supreme Court ruled that the number of jurors could not be reduced below six.\nIn \"Brownlee v The Queen\" (2001) 207 CLR 278, the High Court of Australia unanimously held that a jury of 12 members was not an essential feature of \"trial by jury\" in section 80 of the Australian Constitution.\nIn Scotland, a jury in a criminal trial consists of 15 jurors, which is thought to be the largest in the world. In 2009 a review by the Scottish Government regarding the possibility of reduction led to the decision to retain 15 jurors, with the Cabinet Secretary for Justice stating that after extensive consultation, he had decided that Scotland had got it \"uniquely right\". Trials in the Republic of Ireland which are scheduled to last over 2 months can, but do not have to, have 15 jurors.\nA study by the University of Glasgow suggested that a civil jury of 12 people was ineffective because a few jurors ended up dominating the discussion, and that seven was a better number because more people feel comfortable speaking, and they have an easier time reaching a unanimous decision.\nJury selection.\nJurors are expected to be neutral, so the court may inquire about the jurors' neutrality or otherwise exclude jurors who are perceived as likely to be less than neutral or partial to one side. Jury selection in the United States usually includes organized questioning of the prospective jurors (jury pool) by the lawyers for the plaintiff and the defendant and by the judge\u2014voir dire\u2014as well as rejecting some jurors because of bias or inability to properly serve (\"challenge for cause\"), and the discretionary right of each side to reject a specified number of jurors without having to prove a proper cause for the rejection (\"peremptory challenge\"), before the jury is impaneled.\nSince there is always the possibility of jurors not completing a trial for health or other reasons, often one or more alternate jurors may be selected. Alternates are present for the entire trial but do not take part in deliberating the case and deciding the verdict unless one or more of the impaneled jurors are removed from the jury. For example, in the United Kingdom, a small number of alternate jurors may be empanelled until the end of the opening speeches by counsel, in case a juror realises they are familiar with the matters before the court.\nJurors are selected from a jury pool formed for a specified period of time\u2014usually from one day to two weeks\u2014from lists of citizens living in the jurisdiction of the court. The lists may be electoral rolls (i.e., a list of registered voters in the locale), people who have driver's licenses or other relevant data bases. When selected, being a member of a jury pool is, in principle, compulsory. Prospective jurors are sent a summons and are obligated to appear in a specified jury pool room on a specified date.\nHowever, jurors can be released from the pool for several reasons including illness, prior commitments that cannot be abandoned without hardship, change of address to outside the court's jurisdiction, travel or employment outside the jurisdiction at the time of duty, and others. Often jurisdictions pay token amounts for jury duty and many issue stipends to cover transportation expenses for jurors. Work places cannot penalize employees who serve jury duty. Payments to jurors varies by jurisdiction.\nIn the United States jurors for grand juries are selected from jury pools.\nSelection of jurors from a jury pool occurs when a trial is announced and juror names are randomly selected and called out by the jury pool clerk. Prospective jurors are sent to the courtroom to participate in \"voir dire\", pronounced in French, the oath to speak the truth in the examination testing competence of a juror, or in another application, a witness. Once the list of prospective jurors has assembled in the courtroom the court clerk assigns them seats in the order their names were originally drawn. At this point the judge often will ask each prospective juror to answer a list of general questions such as name, occupation, education, family relationships, time conflicts for the anticipated length of the trial. The list is usually written up and clearly visible to assist nervous prospective jurors and may include several questions uniquely pertinent to the particular trial. These questions are to familiarize the judge and attorneys with the jurors and glean biases, experiences, or relationships that could jeopardize the proper course of the trial.\nAfter each prospective juror has answered the general slate of questions the attorneys may ask follow-up questions of some or all prospective jurors. Each side in the trial is allotted a certain number of challenges to remove prospective jurors from consideration. Some challenges are issued during voir dire while others are presented to the judge at the end of voir dire. The judge calls out the names of the anonymously challenged prospective jurors and those return to the pool for consideration in other trials. A jury is formed, then, of the remaining prospective jurors in the order that their names were originally chosen. Any prospective jurors not thus impaneled return to the jury pool room.\nComposition.\nA jury is intended to be an impartial panel capable of reaching a verdict and representing a variety of people from that area. Achieving this goal can be difficult when juror qualifications differ significantly from the people living in that area. For example, in 19th-century Ireland, the qualified jurors were much wealthier, much less likely to be Roman Catholic, and much less likely to speak only the Irish language than the typical Irish person. In the past, England had special juries, which empaneled only wealthier property owners as jurors. Attacks on the American jury increased after the pool of jurors expanded to include newly-enfranchised women and minorities. \nA head juror is called the \"foreperson\", \"foreman\", or \"presiding juror\". The foreperson may be chosen before the trial begins, or at the beginning of the jury's deliberations. The foreperson may be selected by the judge or by vote of the jurors, depending on the jurisdiction. The foreperson's role may include asking questions (usually to the judge) on behalf of the jury, facilitating jury discussions, and announcing the verdict of the jury.\nRole.\nThe role of the jury is often described as that of a finder of fact, while the judge is usually seen as having the sole responsibility of interpreting the appropriate law and instructing the jury accordingly. The jury determines the truth or falsity of factual allegations and renders a verdict on whether a criminal defendant is guilty, or a civil defendant is civilly liable. Sometimes a jury makes specific findings of fact in what is called a \"special verdict\". A verdict without specific findings of fact that includes only findings of guilt, or civil liability and an overall amount of civil damages, if awarded, is called a \"general verdict\".\nJuries are often justified because they leaven the law with community norms. A jury trial verdict in a case is binding only in that case, and is not a legally binding precedent in other cases. For example, it would be possible for one jury to find that particular conduct is negligent, and another jury to find that the conduct is not negligent, without either verdict being legally invalid, on precisely the same factual evidence. Of course, no two witnesses are exactly the same, and even the same witness will not express testimony in exactly the same way twice, so this would be difficult to prove. It is the role of the judge, not the jury, to determine what law applies to a particular set of facts. However, occasionally jurors find the law to be invalid or unfair, and on that basis acquit the defendant, regardless of the evidence presented that the defendant violated the law. This is commonly referred to as \"jury nullification of law\" or simply jury nullification. When there is no jury (\"bench trial\"), the judge makes rulings on both questions of law and of fact. In most continental European jurisdictions, judges have more power in a trial and the role and powers of a jury are often restricted. Actual jury law and trial procedures differ significantly between countries.\nThe collective knowledge and deliberate nature of juries are also given as reasons in their favor:\nDetailed interviews with jurors after they rendered verdicts in trials involving complex expert testimony have demonstrated careful and critical analysis. The interviewed jurors clearly recognized that the experts were selected within an adversary process. They employed sensible techniques to evaluate the experts\u2019 testimony, such as assessing the completeness and consistency of the testimony, comparing it with other evidence at the trial, and evaluating it against their own knowledge and life experience. Moreover, the research shows that in deliberations jurors combine their individual perspectives on the evidence and debate its relative merits before arriving at a verdict.\nIn the United States, juries are sometimes called on, when asked to do so by a judge in the jury instructions, to make factual findings on particular issues. This may include, for example, aggravating circumstances which will be used to elevate the defendant's sentence if the defendant is convicted. This practice was required in all death penalty cases in \"Blakely v. Washington\", 542 U.S. https:// (2004), where the Supreme Court ruled that allowing judges to make such findings unilaterally violates the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. A similar Sixth Amendment argument in \"Apprendi v. New Jersey\", 530 U.S. https:// (2000) resulted in the Supreme Court's expansion of the requirement to all criminal cases, holding that \"any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\".\nMany U.S. jurisdictions permit the seating of an advisory jury in a civil case in which there is no right to trial by jury to provide non-binding advice to the trial judge, although this procedural tool is rarely used. For example, a judge might seat an advisory jury to guide the judge in awarding non-economic damages (such as \"pain and suffering\" damages) in a case where there is no right to a jury trial, such as (depending on state law) a case involving \"equitable\" rather than \"legal\" claims.\nIn Canada, juries are also allowed to make suggestions for sentencing periods at the time of sentencing. The suggestions of the jury are presented before the judge by the Crown prosecutor(s) before the sentence is handed down. In a small number of U.S. jurisdictions, including the states of Tennessee and Texas, juries are charged both with the task of finding guilt or innocence as well assessing and fixing sentences.\nHowever, this is not the practice in most other legal systems based on the English tradition, in which judges retain sole responsibility for deciding sentences according to law. The exception is the award of damages in English law libel cases, although a judge is now obliged to make a recommendation to the jury as to the appropriate amount.\nIn legal systems based on English tradition, findings of fact by a jury, and jury conclusions that could be supported by jury findings of fact even if the specific factual basis for the verdict is not known, are entitled to great deference on appeal. In other legal systems, it is generally possible for an appellate court to reconsider both findings of fact and conclusions of law made in the trial court, and in those systems, evidence may be presented to appellate courts in what amounts to a trial \"de novo\" (new trial) of appealed findings of fact. The finality of trial court findings of fact in legal systems based on the English tradition has a major impact on court procedure in these systems. This makes it imperative that lawyers be highly prepared for trial because errors and misjudgments related to the presentation of evidence at trial to a jury cannot generally be corrected later on appeal, particularly in court systems based on the English tradition. The higher the stakes, the more this is true. Surprises at trial are much more consequential in court systems based on the English tradition than they are in other legal systems.\nScholarly research on jury behavior in American non-capital criminal felony trials reveals that juror outcomes appear to track the opinions of the median juror, rather than the opinions of the extreme juror on the panel, although juries were required to render unanimous verdicts in the jurisdictions studied. Thus, although juries must render unanimous verdicts, in run-of-the-mill criminal trials they behave in practice as if they were operating using a majority rules voting system.\nJury sentencing.\nJury sentencing is the practice of having juries decide what penalties to give those who have been convicted of criminal offenses. The practice of jury sentencing began in the US state of Virginia in the 18th century and spread westward to other states that were influenced by Virginia-trained lawyers. \nCanadian juries have long had the option to recommend mercy, leniency, or clemency, and the 1961 \"Criminal Code\" required judges to give a jury instruction, following a verdict convicting a defendant of capital murder, soliciting a recommendation as to whether he should be granted clemency. When capital punishment in Canada was abolished in 1976, as part of the same raft of reforms, the \"Criminal Code\" was also amended to grant juries the ability to recommend periods of parole ineligibility immediately following a guilty verdict in second-degree murder cases; however, these recommendations are usually ignored, based on the idea that judges are better-informed about relevant facts and sentencing jurisprudence and, unlike the jury, permitted to give reasons for their judgments.\nProponents of jury sentencing argue that since sentencing involves fact-finding (a task traditionally within the purview of juries), and since the original intent of the founders was to have juries check judges' power, it is the proper role of juries to participate in sentencing. Opponents argue that judges' training and experience with the use of presentence reports and sentencing guidelines, as well as the fact that jury control procedures typically deprive juries of the opportunity to hear information about the defendant's background during the trial, make it more practical to have judges sentence defendants. In Canada, a faint hope clause formerly allowed a jury to be empanelled to consider whether an offender's number of years of imprisonment without eligibility for parole ought to be reduced, but this was repealed in 2011.\nSentencing is said to be more time-consuming for jurors than the relatively easy task of ascertaining guilt or innocence, which means an increase in jury fees and in the amount of productivity lost to jury duty. In New South Wales, a 2007 proposal by Chief Justice Jim Spigelman to involve juries in sentencing was rejected after District Court Chief Judge Reg Blanch cited \"an expected wide difference of views between jurors about questions relating to sentence\". Concerns about jury tampering through intimidation by defendants were also raised.\nGermany and many other continental European countries have a system in which professional judges and lay judges deliberate together at both the trial and sentencing stages; such systems have been praised as a superior alternative because the mixed court dispenses with most of the time\u2010consuming practices of jury control that characterize Anglo\u2010American trial procedure, yet serves the purposes of a jury trial better than plea bargaining and bench trials, which have displaced the jury from routine American practice.\nExperience of jurors.\nThe experience of individual jurors is understudied. However, during times of political unrest jurors have been criminally threatened or physically harmed because of their service, and this resulted in people being less willing to serve, or to prefer the risk of judicial fines for not serving to the risk of criminal retribution if they do serve on the jury.\nJurors typically take their roles very seriously. According to Simon (1980), jurors approach their responsibilities as decision makers much in the same way as a court judge: with great seriousness, a lawful mind, and a concern for consistency that is evidence-based. By actively processing evidence, making inferences, using common sense and personal experiences to inform their decision-making, research has indicated that jurors are effective decision makers who seek thorough understanding, rather than passive, apathetic participants unfit to serve on a jury.\nJury effectiveness.\nResearchers are typically not permitted to study live criminal juries. This is because jury deliberations are conducted privately, to facilitate free and open discussion and minimise outside influence. However, this means that researchers struggle to investigate the effectiveness of real juries. One researcher has therefore suggested that there is a 'jury-shaped hole' at the centre of contemporary jury science. As a result, researchers must study juries indirectly, for example by paying experimental participants to serve on 'mock juries' for the purpose of psychological study.\nExisting research has provided partial support for the proficiency of juries as decision makers due to taking their work seriously to get a fair outcome and by relying on the group to overcome individual biases. However, the purported advantages of collective deliberation is controversial. For example, group dynamics introduce various factors that can distort the reliability of individual judgment--such as interpersonal bias, information cascades, and social pressures to conform to the dominant view. Some note the imperfections in the process and advocate for amendments to the system, with only 3% of US judges favoring abolishing the jury. The thoroughness of the jury trial has also been praised for providing the public with important information that is often not released in alternative procedures like arbitration or adjudication by judges or administrative agencies.\nBias of jurors.\nPsychological research has found that jurors can reach inaccurate decisions as a result of bias, which may include factors such as pre-trial beliefs and attitudes (both explicit and implicit), cognitive bias and biased interpretations of evidence by expert witnesses. Various studies, particularly in the United States, have identified differences in the rate of conviction based on whether jurors and defendants share the same ethnicity. Crime-type bias, where jurors' perceived strength of a prosecutor's case depends on the severity of the crime, is also common.\nJudge-jury agreement.\nEvidence supporting jury effectiveness has also been illustrated in studies that investigate the parallels between judge and jury decision-making. According to Kalven and Zeisel (1966), it is not uncommon to find that the verdicts passed down by juries following a trial match the verdicts held by the appointed judges. Upon surveying judges and jurors of approximately 8,000 criminal and civil trials, it was discovered that the verdicts handed down by both parties were in agreement 80% of the time.\nSuja A. Thomas argues that, \"although results between judges and juries may be similar, judges and juries can disagree. If a choice must be made between a judge or a jury deciding, the diversity, availability of deliberations, the requirement for consensus, the lack of monetary or promotion incentives, and the fresh examination of evidence all make the jury the most attractive, least-biased decision-maker.\"\nIntegrity.\nFor juries to fulfill their role of analyzing the facts of the case, there are strict rules about their use of information during the trial. Juries are often instructed to avoid learning about the case from any source other than the trial (for example from media or the Internet) and not to conduct their own investigations (such as independently visiting a crime scene). Parties to the case, lawyers, and witnesses are not allowed to speak with a member of the jury. Doing these things may constitute reversible error. Rarely, such as in very high-profile cases, the court may order a jury sequestered for the deliberation phase or for the entire trial.\nJurors are generally required to keep their deliberations in strict confidence during the trial and deliberations, and in some jurisdictions even after a verdict is rendered. In Canadian and English law, the jury's deliberations must never be disclosed outside the jury, even years after the case; to repeat parts of the trial or verdict is considered to be contempt of court, a criminal offense. In the United States, confidentiality is usually only required until a verdict has been reached, and jurors have sometimes made remarks that called into question whether a verdict was properly reached. In Australia, academics are permitted to scrutinize the jury process only after obtaining a certificate or approval from the Attorney-General.\nBecause of the importance of preventing undue influence on a jury, embracery, jury intimidation or jury tampering (like witness tampering) is a serious crime, whether attempted through bribery, threat of violence, or other means. At various points in history, when threats to jurors became pervasive, the right to jury trial has been revoked, such as during the 1880s in Ireland.\nRobert Burns and Alexander Hamilton argued that jurors were the least likely decision-makers to be corrupted when compared to judges and all the political branches.\nCriticism.\nSentencing disparities.\nJurors, like most individuals, are not free from holding social and cognitive biases, which could result in sentencing disparities. People may negatively judge individuals who do not adhere to established social norms (e.g., an individual's dress sense) or do not meet societal standards of success. Although these biases tend to influence jurors' individual decisions during a trial, while working as part of a group (i.e., jury), these biases are typically controlled. Groups tend to exert buffering effects that allow jurors to disregard their initial personal biases when forming a credible group decision. Analysis of over a quarter million felony cases in USA found for grand juries no statistical significance for taste-based or statistical discrimination between black and white defendants. \nOther studies found significant sentencing disparities related to in-group favoritism.\nRobert Burns cites Plato in arguing that gaining power and ruling wisely are different skillsets, making the case for a jury of those who have not sought power to create better outcomes than trials left up to judges. Burns further argues that interest groups have increasing influence over political branches, including judges, and that the jury was designed to resist the new Gilded Age-level concentration of power. He also cites Blackstone who argued that it was against human nature for the few (judges) to be attentive to the needs of the many. He also argues the legitimacy of the judiciary increases with a more robust jury. The trial also provides the public with insight into the conduct of judges and the parties involved, further encouraging good behavior. Unlike in other major institutions that run on a more bureaucratic utilitarian logic, the jury checks this way of thinking by bringing common-sense and moral perspectives to bear. Burns contrasts the focus on fact for a jury with other political processes like congressional forums, which he argues are undisciplined forums for overbroad abstractions. Lastly, Burns argues the jury is a vote of confidence for democracy as the most democratic institution (at least in America) and one that demonstrates that it is possible to find common ground on difficult questions, especially when decisions must be unanimous. Juries can show larger sentencing disparities than judges. \nJurors themselves can also be held liable if they compromise their impartiality or commit juror misconduct. Depending on local law, if a juror takes a bribe, the verdict may be overturned and the juror may be fined or imprisoned.\nJury nullification.\n\"Jury nullification\" means the jury decides not to apply the law to the facts in a particular case. In other words, it is \"the process whereby a jury in a criminal case effectively nullifies a law by acquitting a defendant regardless of the weight of evidence against him or her.\"\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, there was a series of such cases, starting in 1670 with the trial of the Quaker William Penn which asserted the (de facto) right, or at least power, of a jury to render a verdict contrary to the facts or law. A good example is the case of one Carnegie of Finhaven who in 1728 accidentally killed the Scottish Earl of Strathmore. As the defendant had undoubtedly killed the Earl, the law (as it stood) required the jury to render the verdict that the case had been \"proven\" and cause Carnegie of Finhaven to die for an accidental killing. Instead, the jury asserted what is believed to be their \"ancient right\" to judge the whole case and not just the facts and brought in the verdict of \"not guilty\".\nToday in the United States, juries are instructed by the judge to follow the judge's instructions concerning what is the law and to render a verdict solely on the evidence presented in court. Important past exercises of nullification include cases involving slavery (see Fugitive Slave Act of 1850), freedom of the press (see John Peter Zenger), and freedom of religion (see William Penn).\nIn \"United States v. Moylan\", 417 F.2d 1002 (4th. Cir. 1969), Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal unanimously ruled: \"If the jury feels that the law under which the defendant is accused is unjust, or exigent circumstances justified the actions of the accused, or for any reason which appeals to their logic or passion, the jury has the right to acquit, and the courts must abide that decision.\" The Fully Informed Jury Association is a non-profit educational organization dedicated to informing jurors of their rights and seeking the passage of laws to require judges to inform jurors that they can and should judge the law. In \"Sparf v. United States\", 156 U.S. https:// (1895), the Supreme Court, in a 5\u20134 decision, held that a trial judge has no responsibility to inform the jury of the right to nullify laws.\nModern American jurisprudence is generally intolerant of the practice, and a juror can be removed from a case if the judge believes that the juror is aware of the power of nullification.\nIn the United Kingdom, a similar power exists, often called jury equity. This enables a jury to reach a decision in direct contradiction with the law if they feel the law is unjust. This can create a persuasive precedent for future cases, or render prosecutors reluctant to bring a charge \u2013 thus a jury has the power to influence the law.\nThe standard justification of jury equity is taken from the final few pages of Lord Devlin's book \"Trial by Jury\". Devlin explained jury equity through two now-famous metaphors: that the jury is \"the lamp that shows that freedom lives\" and that it is a \"little parliament\". The second metaphor emphasises that, just as members of parliament are generally dominated by government but can occasionally assert their independence, juries are usually dominated by judges but can, in extraordinary circumstances, throw off this control. Devlin thereby sought to emphasise that neither jury equity nor judicial control is set in stone.\nPerhaps the best example of modern-day jury equity in England and Wales was the acquittal of Clive Ponting, on a charge of revealing secret information, under section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 in 1985. Mr Ponting's defence was that the revelation was in the public interest. The trial judge directed the jury that \"the public interest is what the government of the day says it is\" \u2013 effectively a direction to the jury to convict. Nevertheless, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.\nAnother example is the acquittal in 1989 of Michael Randle and Pat Pottle, who confessed in open court to charges of springing the Soviet spy George Blake from Wormwood Scrubs Prison and smuggling him to East Germany in 1966. Pottle successfully appealed to the jury to disregard the judge's instruction that they consider only whether the defendants were guilty in law, and assert a jury's ancient right to throw out a politically motivated prosecution, in this case, compounded by its cynical untimeliness.\nIn Scotland (with a separate legal system from that of England and Wales) although technically the \"not guilty\" verdict was originally a form of jury nullification, over time the interpretation has changed so that now the \"not guilty\" verdict has become the normal one when a jury is not persuaded of guilt and the \"not proven\" verdict is only used when the jury is not certain of innocence or guilt. It is absolutely central to Scottish and English law that there is a presumption of innocence. It is not a trivial distinction, since any shift in the burden of proof is a significant change which undermines the safeguard for the citizen.\nTrial procedures by country.\nOverall, jury use has been increasing worldwide.\nAfrica.\nGhana.\nIn Ghana, juries have seven members, and their sole duty is to determine whether the person is guilty. They have no role in sentencing.\nAmericas.\nBrazil.\nThe Constitution of Brazil provides that only willful crimes against life, namely full or attempted murder, abortion, infanticide and suicide instigation, be judged by juries. Seven jurors vote in secret to decide whether the defendant is guilty or not, and decisions are taken by the majority.\nBrazil stands alone among countries with jury systems in prohibiting juror deliberation. Under the \"incommunicability rule\" (\"regra da incomunicabilidade\"), Brazilian jurors must decide verdicts individually, without discussing the case with one another.\nManslaughter and other crimes in which the killing was committed without intent, however, are judged by a professional judge instead.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, juries are used for some criminal trials but not others. For summary conviction offences or offences found under section 553 of the Criminal Code (theft and fraud up to the value of $5,000 and certain nuisance offences), the trial is before a judge alone. For most indictable offences, the accused person can elect to be tried by either a judge alone or a judge and jury. In the most serious offences, found in section 469 of the Criminal Code (such as murder or treason), a judge and a jury are always used, unless both the accused and the prosecutor agree that the trial should not be in front of a jury. The jury's verdict on the ultimate disposition of guilt or innocence must be unanimous, but can disagree on the evidentiary route that leads to that disposition.\nJuries do not make a recommendation as to the length of sentence, except for parole ineligibility for second-degree murder (but the judge is not bound by the jury's recommendation, and the jury is not required to make a recommendation).\nJury selection is in accordance with specific criteria. Prospective jurors may only be asked certain questions, selected for direct pertinence to impartiality or other relevant matters. Any other questions must be approved by the judge.\nA jury in a criminal trial initially has 12 members. The trial judge has the discretion to direct that one or two alternate jurors also be appointed. If a juror is discharged during the course of the trial, the trial will continue with an alternate juror, unless the number of jurors goes below 10.\nThe \"Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\" guarantees that anyone tried for an offense that has a maximum sentence of five or more years has the right to be tried by a jury (except for an offence under military law).\nThe names of jurors are protected by a publication ban. There is a specific criminal offense for disclosing anything that takes place during jury deliberations.\nJuries are infrequently used in civil trials in Canada. There are no civil juries in the courts of the province of Quebec, nor in the Federal Court.\nUnited States.\nIn criminal law in federal courts and a minority of state court systems of the United States, a grand jury is convened to hear only testimony and evidence to determine whether there is a sufficient basis for deciding to indict the defendant and proceed toward trial. In each court district where a grand jury is required, a group of 16\u201323 citizens holds an inquiry on criminal complaints brought by the prosecutor to decide whether a trial is warranted (based on the standard that probable cause exists that a crime was committed), in which case an indictment is issued. In jurisdictions where the size of a jury varies, in general the size of juries tends to be larger if the crime alleged is more serious. If a grand jury rejects a proposed indictment the grand jury's action is known as a \"no bill.\" If they accept a proposed indictment, the grand jury's action is known as a \"true bill.\" Grand jury proceedings are \"ex parte\": only the prosecutor and witnesses who the prosecutor calls may present evidence to the grand jury and defendants are not allowed to present mitigating evidence or even to know the testimony that was presented to the grand jury, and hearsay evidence is permitted. This is so because a grand jury cannot convict a defendant. It can only decide to indict the defendant and proceed forward toward trial. Grand juries vote to indict in the overwhelming majority of cases, and prosecutors are not prohibited from presenting the same case to a new grand jury if a \"no bill\" was returned by a previous grand jury. A typical grand jury considers a new criminal case every fifteen minutes. In some jurisdictions, in addition to indicting persons for crimes, a grand jury may also issue reports on matters that they investigate apart from the criminal indictments, particularly when the grand jury investigation involves a public scandal. Historically, grand juries were sometimes used in American law to serve a purpose similar to an investigatory commission.\nBoth Article III of the U.S. Constitution and the Sixth Amendment require that criminal cases be tried by a jury. Originally this applied only to federal courts. However, the Fourteenth Amendment extended this mandate to the states. Although the Constitution originally did not require a jury for civil cases, this led to an uproar which was followed by adoption of the Seventh Amendment, which requires a civil jury in cases where the value in dispute is greater than twenty dollars. However, the Seventh Amendment right to a civil jury trial does not apply in state courts, where the right to a jury is strictly a matter of state law. However, in practice, all states except Louisiana preserve the right to a jury trial in almost all civil cases where the sole remedy sought is money damages to the same extent as jury trials are permitted by the Seventh Amendment. Under the law of many states, jury trials are not allowed in small claims cases. The civil jury in the United States is a defining element of the process by which personal injury trials are handled.\nIn practice, even though the defendant in a criminal action is entitled to a trial by jury, most criminal actions in the U.S. are resolved by plea bargain. Only about 2% of civil cases go to trial, with only about half of those trials being conducted before juries.\nIn 1898 the Supreme Court held that the jury must be composed of at least twelve persons, although this was not necessarily extended to state civil jury trials. In 1970, however, the Supreme Court held that the twelve person requirement was a \"historical accident\", and upheld six-person juries if provided for under state law in both criminal and civil state court cases. There is controversy over smaller juries, with proponents arguing that they are more efficient and opponents arguing that they lead to fluctuating verdicts. In a later case, however, the court rejected the use of five-person juries in criminal cases. Juries go through a selection process called \"voir dire\" in which the lawyers question the jurors and then make \"challenges for cause\" and \"peremptory challenges\" to remove jurors. Traditionally the removal of jurors based on a peremptory challenge required no justification or explanation, but the tradition has been changed by the Supreme Court where the reason for the peremptory challenge was the race of the potential juror. Since the 1970s \"scientific jury selection\" has become popular.\nUnanimous jury verdicts have been standard in US American law. This requirement was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1897, but the standard was relaxed in 1972 in two criminal cases. As of 1999 over thirty states had laws allowing less than unanimity in civil cases, but, until 2020, Oregon and Louisiana were the only states which have laws allowing less than unanimous jury verdicts for criminal cases (these laws were overturned in \"Ramos v. Louisiana\"). When the required number of jurors cannot agree on a verdict (a situation sometimes referred to as a \"hung jury\"), a mistrial is declared, and the case may be retried with a newly constituted jury. The practice generally was that the jury rules only on questions of fact and guilt; setting the penalty was reserved for the judge. This practice was confirmed by rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court such as in \"Ring v. Arizona\", which found Arizona's practice of having the judge decide whether aggravating factors exist to make a defendant eligible for the death penalty, to be unconstitutional, and reserving the determination of whether the aggravating factors exist to be decided by the jury. However, in some states (such as Alabama and Florida), the ultimate decision on the punishment is made by the judge, and the jury gives only a non-binding recommendation. The judge can impose the death penalty even if the jury recommends life without parole.\nThere is no set format for jury deliberations, and the jury takes a period of time to settle into discussing the evidence and deciding on guilt and any other facts the judge instructs them to determine. Deliberation is done by the jury only, with none of the lawyers, the judge, or the defendant present. The first step will typically be to find out the initial feeling or reaction of the jurors to the case, which may be by a show of hands, or via secret ballot. The jury will then attempt to arrive at a consensus verdict. The discussion usually helps to identify jurors' views to see whether a consensus will emerge as well as areas that bear further discussion. Points often arise that were not specifically discussed during the trial. The result of these discussions is that in most cases the jury comes to a unanimous decision and a verdict is thus achieved. In some states and under circumstances, the decision need not be unanimous.\nIn a few states and in death penalty cases, depending upon the law, the trial jury, or sometimes a separate jury, may determine whether the death penalty is appropriate in \"capital\" murder cases. Usually, sentencing is handled by the judge at a separate hearing. The judge may but does not always follow the recommendations of the jury when deciding on a sentence.\nAsia and Oceania.\nAustralia.\nStates.\nEach state may determine the extent to which the use of a jury is used. The use of a jury is optional for civil trials in any Australian state. The use of a jury in criminal trials is generally by a unanimous verdict of 12 lay members of the public. Some States provide exceptions such as majority (11-to-1 or 10-to-2) verdicts where a jury cannot otherwise reach a verdict. All states except Victoria allow a person accused of a criminal offence to elect to be tried by a judge-alone rather than the default jury provision.\nCommonwealth (Federal).\nThe Constitution of Australia provides in section 80 that 'the trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury'. The Commonwealth can determine which offences are 'on indictment'. It would be entirely consistent with the Constitution that a homicide offence could be tried not 'on indictment,' or conversely that a simple assault could be tried 'on indictment.' This interpretation has been criticized as a 'mockery' of the section, rendering it useless.\nWhere a trial 'on indictment' has been prescribed, it is an essential element that it be found by a unanimous verdict of guilty by 12 lay members of the public. This requirement stems from the (historical) meaning of 'jury' at the time that the Constitution was written and is (in principle) thus an integral element of trial by jury. Unlike in the Australian states, an accused person cannot elect a Judge-only trial, even where both the accused and the prosecutor seek such a trial.\nIn November 2023, Indigenous Australian law expert Pattie Lees called for greater inclusion of First Nations people in the jury system to create a more \"fair, just\" system.\"\nHong Kong.\nArticle 86 of the Hong Kong Basic Law assures the practice of jury trials. Criminal cases in the High Court and some civil cases are tried by a jury in Hong Kong. There is no jury in the District Court. In addition, from time to time, the Coroner's Court may summon a jury to decide the cause of death in an inquest. Criminal cases are normally tried by a 7-person jury and sometimes, at the discretion of the court, a 9-person jury. Nevertheless, the Jury Ordinance requires that a jury in any proceedings should be composed of at least 5 jurors.\nAlthough article 86 of the basic law states that \u2018the principle of trial by jury previously practiced in Hong Kong shall be maintained\u2019, it does not guarantee that every case is to be tried by a jury. In the case \"Chiang Lily v. Secretary for Justice\" (2010), the Court of Final Appeal agreed that \u2018there is no right to trial by jury in Hong Kong.\u2019\nIndia.\nJury trials were abolished in most Indian courts by the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure . Nanavati Case was not the last Jury trial in India. West Bengal had Jury trials as late as 1973. Juries were not mentioned in the 1950 Indian Constitution, and it was ignored in many Indian states. The Law Commission recommended their abolition in 1958 in its 14th Report. They were retained in a discreet manner for Parsi divorce courts, wherein a panel of members called 'delegates' are randomly selected from the community to decide the fact of the case. Parsi divorce law is governed by 'The Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936' as amended in 1988, and is a mixture of the Panchayat legal system and jury process.\nNew Zealand.\nJuries are used in all trials involving Category 4 offences such as treason, murder and manslaughter, although in exceptional circumstances a judge-alone trial may be ordered. At the option of the defendant, juries may be used in trials involving Category 3 offences, that is, offences where the maximum penalty available is two years' imprisonment or greater. In civil cases, juries are only used in cases of defamation, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Juries must initially try to reach a unanimous verdict, but if one cannot be reached in a reasonable timeframe, the judge may accept a majority verdict of all-but-one (i.e. 11\u20131 or 10\u20131) in criminal cases and three-quarters (i.e. 9\u20133 or 9\u20132) in civil cases.\nEurope.\nBelgium.\nThe Belgian Constitution provides that all cases involving the most serious crimes be judged by juries. As a safeguard against libel cases, press crimes can also only be tried by a jury. Racism is excluded from this safeguard.\nTwelve jurors decide by a qualified majority of two-thirds whether the defendant is guilty or not. A tied vote result in 'not guilty'; a '7 guilty \u2013 5 not guilty' vote is transferred to the 3 professional judges who can, by unanimity, reverse the majority to 'not guilty'. The sentence is delivered by a majority of the 12 jurors and the 3 professional judges. As a result of the \"Taxquet\" ruling the juries give nowadays the most important motives that lead them to their verdict. The procedural codification has been altered to meet the demands formulated by the European Court of Human Rights.\nFrance.\nIn the Cour d'assises.\nThree professional judges sit alongside six jurors in first instance proceedings or nine in appeal proceedings. Before 2012, there were nine or twelve jurors, but this was reduced to cut spending. A two-thirds majority is needed in order to convict the defendant. During these procedures, judges and jurors have equal positions on questions of fact, while judges decide on questions of procedure. Judges and jurors also have equal positions on sentencing.\nGermany.\nTrial by jury was introduced in most German states after the revolutionary events of 1848. However, it remained controversial; and, early in the 20th century, there were moves to abolish it. The Emminger Reform of January 4, 1924, during an Article 48 state of emergency, abolished the jury system and replaced it with a mixed system including bench trials and lay judges.\nIn 1925, the Social Democrats called for the reinstitution of the jury; a special meeting of the German Bar demanded revocation of the decrees, but \"on the whole the abolition of the jury caused little commotion\". Their verdicts were widely perceived as unjust and inconsistent.\nToday, most misdemeanors are tried by a \"Strafrichter\", meaning a single judge at an \"Amtsgericht\"; felonies and more severe misdemeanors are tried by a \"Sch\u00f6ffengericht\", also located at the \"Amtsgericht\", composed of 1 judge and 2 lay judges; some felonies are heard by \"Erweitertes Sch\u00f6ffengericht\", or extended \"Sch\u00f6ffengericht\", composed of 2 judges and 2 lay judges; severe felonies and other \"special\" crimes are tried by the \"gro\u00dfe Strafkammer\", composed of 3 judges and 2 lay judges at the \"Landgericht\", with specially assigned courts for some crimes called \"Sonderstrafkammer\"; felonies resulting in the death of a human being are tried by the \"Schwurgericht\", composed of 3 judges and 2 lay judges, located at the \"Landgericht\"; and serious crimes against the state are tried by the \"Strafsenat\", composed of 5 judges, at an \"Oberlandesgericht\".\nIn some civil cases, such as commercial law or patent law, there are also lay judges, who have to meet certain criteria (e.g., being a merchant).\nIreland.\nThe law in Ireland is historically based on English common law and had a similar jury system. Article 38 of the 1937 Constitution of Ireland mandates trial by jury for criminal offences, with exceptions for minor offences, military tribunals, and where \"the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order\". In \"DPP v Nally\" [2006] IECCA 128 Kearns J set out that a jury has the right to reach a not guilty verdict even in direct contradiction of the evidence.\nThe principal statute regulating the selection, obligations and conduct of juries is the Juries Act 1976 as amended by the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008. There is a fine of \u20ac500 for failing to report for jury service, though this was poorly enforced until a change of policy at the Courts Service in 2016. Criminal jury trials are held in the Circuit Court or the Central Criminal Court. Juryless trials under the inadequacy exception, dealing with terrorism or organised crime, are held in the Special Criminal Court, on application by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Juries are also used in some civil law trials, such as for defamation; they are sometimes used at coroner's inquests.\nNormally consisting of twelve persons, juries are selected from a jury panel which is picked at random by the county registrar from Irish citizens on the D\u00e1il electoral register. Juries only decide questions of fact and have no role in criminal sentencing. It is not necessary that a jury be unanimous in its verdict. In civil cases, a verdict may be reached by a majority of nine of the twelve members. In a criminal case, a verdict need not be unanimous where there are not fewer than eleven jurors if ten of them agree on a verdict after considering the case for a \"reasonable time\". Juries are not paid, nor do they receive travel expenses; however they do receive lunch for the days that they are serving. The Law Reform Commission examined jury service, producing a consultation paper in 2010 and then a report in 2013. One of its recommendations, to permit extra jurors for long trials in case some are excused, was enacted in 2013. In November 2013, the DPP requested a 15-member jury at the trial of three Anglo Irish Bank executives. Where more than twelve jurors are present, twelve will be chosen by lot to retire and consider the verdict.\nItaly.\nIn Italy, a civil law jurisdiction, untrained judges are present only in the Corte d'Assise, where two career magistrates are supported by six so-called \"lay judges\", who are chosen by lot from the registrar of voters. Any Italian citizen, with no distinction of sex or religion, between 30 and 65 years of age, can be appointed as a lay judge; in order to be eligible as a lay judge for the \"Corte d'Assise\", however, there is a minimum educational requirement, as the lay judge must have completed his/her education at the \"Scuola Media\" (junior high school) level, while said level is raised for the \"Corte d'Assise d'Appello\" (appeal level of the Corte d'Assise) to the \"Scuola Superiore\" (senior high school) degree. In the Corte d'Assise, decisions concerning both fact and law matters are taken by the stipendiary judges and \"lay judges\" together at a special meeting behind closed doors, named \"Camera di Consiglio\" (\"Counsel Chamber\"), and the Court is subsequently required to publish written explanations of its decisions within 90 days from the verdict. Errors of law or inconsistencies in the explanation of a decision can and usually will lead to the annulment of the decision. A Court d'Assise and a Court d'Assise d'Appello decides on a majority of votes, and therefore predominantly on the votes of the lay judges, who are a majority of six to two, but in fact lay judges, who are not trained to write such explanation and must rely on one or the other stipendiary judge to do it, are effectively prevented from overruling both of them. The \"Corte d'Assise\" has jurisdiction to try crimes carrying a maximum penalty of 24 years in prison or life imprisonment, and other serious crimes; felonies that fall under its jurisdiction include terrorism, murder, manslaughter, severe attempts against State personalities, as well as some matters of law requiring ethical and professional evaluations (e.g. assisted suicide), while it generally has no jurisdiction over cases whose evaluation requires knowledge of law which the \"lay judges\" generally do not have. Penalties imposed by the court can include life sentences.\nNorway.\nJuries existed in Norway as early as the year 800, and perhaps even earlier. They brought the jury system to England and Scotland. Juries were phased out as late as the 17th century, when Norway's central government was in Copenhagen, Denmark. Though Norway and Denmark had different legal systems throughout their personal union (1387\u20131536), and later under the governmental union (1536\u20131814), there was attempt to harmonize the legal systems of the two countries. Even if juries were abolished, the layman continued to play an important role in the legal system throughout in Norway.\nThe jury was reintroduced in 1887, and was then solely used in criminal cases on the second tier of the three-tier Norwegian court system (\"Lagmannsretten\"). The jury consisted of 10 people, and had to reach a majority verdict consisting of seven or more of the jurors. The jury never gave a reason for its verdict, rather it simply gave a \"guilty\" or \"non-guilty\" verdict. The jury foreperson, elected by the jury on the first day, with three other jury members also made up the majority in the sentencing, if the accused were found guilty.\nIn Norway the term \"guilty\", is not used, only yes or no to the actions asked them to consider done by the accused by the prosecutor. The last jury case was in 2018, after juries were abolished after the European Court condideres that no-one should be sentenced without the considerations in the judgement.\nIn a sense, the concept of being judged by one's peers existed on both the first and second tier of the Norwegian court system: In Tingretten, one judge and two lay judges preside, and in Lagmannsretten two judges and five lay judges preside. The lay judges do not hold any legal qualification, and represent the peers of the person on trial, as members of the general public. As a guarantee against any abuse of power by the educated elite, the number of lay judges always exceeds the number of appointed judges. In the Supreme Court, only trained lawyers are seated.\nRussia.\nThe right to a jury trial is provided by Constitution of Russian Federation but for criminal cases only and in the procedure defined by law. Initially, the Criminal Procedure Code, which was adopted in 2001, provided that the right to a jury trial could be realized in criminal cases which should be heard by regional courts and military courts of military districts/fleets as the courts of first instance; the jury was composed of 12 jurors. In 2008, the anti-state criminal cases (treason, espionage, armed rebellion, sabotage, mass riot, creating an illegal paramilitary group, forcible seizure of power, terrorism) were removed from the jurisdiction of the jury trial. From 1 June 2018, defendants can claim a jury trial in criminal cases which are heard by district courts and garrison military courts as the courts of first instance; from that moment on, the jury is composed of 8 (in regional courts and military courts of military districts/fleets) or 6 (in district courts and garrison military courts) jurors.\nA juror must be at least 25 years old, legally competent, and without a criminal record.\nSpain.\nSpain has no strong tradition of using juries. However, there is some mentions in the Bayonne Statute of 1808. Later, Article 307 of the Spanish Constitution of 1812 allowed the \"Cortes\" to pass legislation if they felt that over the time it was needed to distinguish between \"judges of law\" and \"judges of facts\". Such legislation however was never enacted.\nArticle 2 of the Spanish Constitution of 1837 while proclamating the freedom of the people to publicate written contents without previous censorship according to the laws also provided that \"press crimes\" could only be tried by juries. This meant that a \"grand jury\" would need to indict, and a \"petit jury\" would need to convict.\nJuries were later abolished in 1845, but were later restored in 1869 for all \"political crimes\" and \"those common crimes the law may deem appropriate to be so tried by a jury\". A Law concerning the Jury entered into force on January 1, 1899, and lasted until 1936, where juries were again disbanded with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.\nThe actual Constitution of 1978 permits the \"Cortes Generales\" to pass legislation allowing juries in criminal trials. The provision is arguably somewhat vague: \"Article 125 \u2013 Citizens may engage in popular action and participate in the administration of justice through the institution of the Jury, in the manner and with respect to those criminal trials as may be determined by law, as well as in customary and traditional courts.\"\nJury trials can only happen in the criminal jurisdiction and it is not a choice of the defendant to be tried by jury, or by a single judge or a panel of judges. Organic Law 5/1995, of May 22 regulates the categories of crimes in which a trial by jury is mandatory. For all other crimes, a single judge or a panel of judges will decide both on facts and the law. Spanish juries are composed of 9 citizens and a professional Judge. Juries decide on facts and whether to convict or acquit the defendant. In case of conviction they can also make recommendations such as if the defendant should be pardoned if they asked to, or if they think the defendant could be released on parole, etc.\nOne of the first jury trial cases was that of Mikel Otegi who was tried in 1997 for the murder of two police officers. After a confused trial, five jury members of a total of nine voted to acquit and the judge ordered the accused set free. This verdict shocked the nation. An alleged miscarriage of justice by jury trial was the Wanninkhof murder case.\nSweden.\nIn press libel cases and other cases concerning offenses against freedom of the press, the question of whether or not the printed material falls outside permissible limits is submitted to a jury of 9 members which provides a pre-screening before the case is ruled on by normal courts. In these cases 6 out of 9 jurors must find against the defendant, and may not be overruled in cases of acquittal.\nSweden has no tradition of using juries in most types of criminal or civil trial. The sole exception, since 1815, is in cases involving freedom of the press, prosecuted under Chapter 7 of the Freedom of the Press Act, part of Sweden's constitution. The most frequently prosecuted offence under this act is defamation, although in total eighteen offences, including high treason and espionage, are covered. These cases are tried in district courts (first tier courts) by a jury of nine laymen.\nThe jury in press freedom cases rules only on the facts of the case and the question of guilt or innocence. The trial judge may overrule a jury's guilty verdict, but may not overrule an acquittal. A conviction requires a majority verdict of 6\u20133. Sentencing is the sole prerogative of judges.\nJury members must be Swedish citizens and resident in the county in which the case is being heard. They must be of sound judgement and known for their independence and integrity. Combined, they should represent a range of social groups and opinions, as well as all parts of the county. It is the county council that have the responsibility to appoints juries for a tenure of four years under which they may serve in multiple cases. The appointed jurymen are divided into two groups, in most counties the first with sixteen members and the second with eight. From this pool of available jurymen the court hears and excludes those with conflicts of interest in the case, after which the defendants and plaintiffs have the right to exclude a number of members, varying by county and group. The final jury is then randomly selected by drawing of lots.\nJuries are not used in other criminal and civil cases. For most other cases in the first and second tier courts lay judges sit alongside professional judges. Lay judges participate in deciding both the facts of the case and sentencing. Lay judges are appointed by local authorities, or in practice by the political parties represented on the authorities. Lay judges are therefore usually selected from among nominees of ruling political parties.\nUnited Kingdom.\nEngland and Wales.\nIn England and Wales jury trials are used for criminal cases, requiring 12 jurors (between the ages of 18 and 75), although the trial may continue with as few as 9. The right to a jury trial has been enshrined in English law since Magna Carta in 1215, and is most common in serious cases, although the defendant can insist on a jury trial for most criminal cases. Jury trials in complex fraud cases have been described by some members and appointees of the Labour Party as expensive and time-consuming. In contrast, the Bar Council, Liberty and other political parties have supported the idea that trial by jury is at the heart of the judicial system and placed the blame for a few complicated jury trials failing on inadequate preparation by the prosecution.\nOn 18 June 2009 the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, sitting in the Court of Appeal, made English legal history by ruling that a criminal trial in the Crown Court could take place without a jury, under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.\nJury trials are also available for some few areas of civil law (for example defamation cases and those involving police conduct); these also require 12 jurors (9 in the County Court). However less than 1% of civil trials involve juries. At the new Manchester Civil Justice Centre, constructed in 2008, fewer than 10 of the 48 courtrooms had jury facilities.\nNorthern Ireland.\nDuring the Troubles in Northern Ireland, jury trials were suspended and trials took place before Diplock Courts. These were essentially bench trials before judges only. This was to combat jury nullification and the intimidation of juries.\nScotland.\nIn Scottish criminal trials, juries are composed of fifteen residents, while in civil trials there is a jury of 12 people.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"jury\" derives from Middle English jure, from Anglo-Norman juree, from Medieval Latin i\u016br\u0101ta, from Latin i\u016br\u014d (\u201cI swear or take an oath\u201d). Juries are most common in common law adversarial-system jurisdictions. In the modern system, juries act as triers of fact, while judges act as triers of law (but see nullification). A trial without a jury (in which both questions of fact and questions of law are decided by a judge) is known as a bench trial.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "44723", "revid": "11096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44723", "title": "Printing", "text": "Process for reproducing text and images\nPrinting is a process for mass reproducing text and images using a master form or template. The earliest non-paper products involving printing include cylinder seals and objects such as the Cyrus Cylinder and the Cylinders of Nabonidus. The earliest known form of printing evolved from ink rubbings made on paper or cloth from texts on stone tablets, used during the sixth century. Printing by pressing an inked image onto paper (using woodblock printing) appeared later that century. Later developments in printing technology include the movable type invented by Bi Sheng around 1040 and the printing press invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century. The technology of printing played a key role in the development of the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution and laid the material basis for the modern knowledge-based economy and the spread of learning to the masses.\nHistory.\nWoodblock printing.\nWoodblock printing is a technique for printing text, images or patterns that was used widely throughout East Asia. It originated in China in antiquity as a method of printing on textiles and later on paper. \nIn East Asia.\nThe earliest examples of ink-squeeze rubbings and potential stone printing blocks appear in the mid-sixth century in China. A type of printing called mechanical woodblock printing on paper started during the 7th century in the Tang dynasty, and subsequently spread throughout East Asia. Nara Japan printed the Hyakumant\u014d Darani en masse around 770, and distributed them to temples throughout Japan. In Korea, an example of woodblock printing from the eighth century was discovered in 1966. A copy of the Buddhist Dharani Sutra called the Pure Light Dharani Sutra (Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0; RR:\u00a0), discovered in Gyeongju, in a Silla dynasty pagoda that was repaired in 751, was undated but must have been created sometime before the reconstruction of the Shakyamuni Pagoda of Bulguk Temple, Kyongju Province in 751. The document is estimated to have been created no later than 704.\nBy the ninth century, printing on paper had taken off, and the first completely surviving printed book is the Diamond Sutra (British Library) of 868, uncovered from Dunhuang. By the tenth century, 400,000 copies of some sutras and pictures were printed, and the Confucian classics were in print. A skilled printer could print up to 2,000 double-page sheets per day.\nPrinting spread early to Korea and Japan, which also used Chinese logograms, but the technique was also used in Turpan and Vietnam using a number of other scripts. This technique then spread to Persia and Russia. This technique was transmitted to Europe by around 1400 and was used on paper for old master prints and playing cards.351-367\nIn the Middle East.\nBlock printing, called \"tarsh\" in Arabic, developed in Arabic Egypt during the ninth and tenth centuries, mostly for prayers and amulets. There is some evidence to suggest that these print blocks were made from non-wood materials, possibly tin, lead, or clay. The techniques employed are uncertain. Block printing later went out of use during the Timurid Renaissance. The printing technique in Egypt was embraced by reproducing texts on paper strips and supplying them in different copies to meet the demand.\nIn Europe.\nBlock printing first came to Europe as a method for printing on cloth, where it was common by 1300. Images printed on cloth for religious purposes could be quite large and elaborate. When paper became relatively easily available, around 1400, the technique transferred very quickly to small woodcut religious images and playing cards printed on paper. These prints were produced in very large numbers from about 1425 onward.\nAround the mid-fifteenth-century, \"block-books\", woodcut books with both text and images, usually carved in the same block, emerged as a cheaper alternative to manuscripts and books printed with movable type. These were all short, heavily illustrated works, the bestsellers of the day, repeated in many different block-book versions: the and the Biblia pauperum were the most common. There is still some controversy among scholars as to whether their introduction preceded or, in the majority view, followed the introduction of movable type, with the estimated range of dates being between about 1440 and 1460.\nMovable-type printing.\nMovable type is the system of printing and typography using movable pieces of metal type, made by casting from matrices struck by letterpunches. Movable type allowed for much more flexible processes than hand copying or block printing.\nAround 1040, the first known movable type system was created in China by Bi Sheng out of porcelain. Bi Sheng used clay type, which broke easily, but Wang Zhen by 1298 had carved a more durable type from wood. He also developed a complex system of revolving tables and number-association with written Chinese characters that made typesetting and printing more efficient. Still, the main method in use there remained woodblock printing (xylography), which \"proved to be cheaper and more efficient for printing Chinese, with its thousands of characters\".\nCopper movable type printing originated in China at the beginning of the 12th century. It was used in large-scale printing of paper money\nissued by the Northern Song dynasty. Movable type spread to Korea during the Goryeo dynasty.\nAround 1230, Koreans invented a metal type movable printing using bronze. The \"Jikji\", published in 1377, is the earliest known metal printed book. Type-casting was used, adapted from the method of casting coins. The character was cut in beech wood, which was then pressed into a soft clay to form a mould, and bronze poured into the mould, and finally the type was polished. Eastern metal movable type was spread to Europe between the late 14th and early 15th centuries. The Korean form of metal movable type was described by the French scholar Henri-Jean Martin as \"extremely similar to Gutenberg's\". Authoritative historians Frances Gies and Joseph Gies claimed that \"The Asian priority of invention movable type is now firmly established, and that Chinese-Korean technique, or a report of it traveled westward is almost certain.\" \nThe printing press.\nAround 1450, Johannes Gutenberg introduced the first movable type printing system in Europe. He advanced innovations in casting type based on a matrix and hand mould, adaptations to the screw-press, the use of an oil-based ink, and the creation of a softer and more absorbent paper. Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead, tin, antimony, copper and bismuth \u2013 the same components still used today. Johannes Gutenberg started work on his printing press around 1436, in partnership with Andreas Dritzehen \u2013 whom he had previously instructed in gem-cutting \u2013 and Andreas Heilmann, the owner of a paper mill.\nCompared to woodblock printing, movable type page setting and printing using a press was faster and more durable. Also, the metal type pieces were sturdier and the lettering more uniform, leading to typography and fonts. The high quality and relatively low price of the Gutenberg Bible (1455) established the superiority of movable type for Western languages. The printing press rapidly spread across Europe, leading up to the Renaissance, and later all around the world.\nTime Life magazine called Gutenberg's innovations in movable type printing the most important invention of the second millennium.\nRotary printing press.\nThe steam-powered rotary printing press, invented in 1843 in the United States by Richard M. Hoe, ultimately allowed millions of copies of a page in a single day. Mass production of printed works flourished after the transition to rolled paper, as continuous feed allowed the presses to run at a much faster pace. Hoe's original design operated at up to 2,000 revolutions per hour where each revolution deposited 4 page images, giving the press a throughput of 8,000 pages per hour. By 1891, The New York World and Philadelphia Item were operating presses producing either 90,000 4-page sheets per hour or 48,000 8-page sheets.\nThe rotary printing press uses impressions curved around a cylinder to print on long continuous rolls of paper or other substrates. Rotary drum printing was later significantly improved by William Bullock. There are multiple types of rotary printing press technologies that are still used today: sheetfed offset, rotogravure, and flexographic printing.\nPrinting capacity.\nThe table lists the maximum number of pages which various press designs could print \"per hour\".\nConventional printing technology.\nAll printing process are concerned with two kinds of areas on the final output:\nAfter the information has been prepared for production (the prepress step), each printing process has definitive means of separating the image from the non-image areas.\nConventional printing has four types of process:\nCrop marks.\nTo print an image without a blank area around the image, the non-printing areas must be trimmed after printing. Crop marks can be used to show the printer where the printing area ends, and the non-printing area begins. The part of the image which is trimmed off is called bleed.\nLetterpress.\nLetterpress printing is a technique of relief printing. A worker composes and locks movable type into the bed of a press, inks it, and presses paper against it to transfer the ink from the type which creates an impression on the paper. \nThere is different paper for different works the quality of paper shows different ink to use.\nLetterpress printing was the normal form of printing text from its invention by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century and remained in wide use for books and other uses until the second half of the 20th century, when offset printing was developed. More recently, letterpress printing has seen a revival in an artisanal form.\nOffset.\nOffset printing is a widely used modern printing process. This technology is best described as when a positive (right-reading) image on a printing plate is inked and transferred (or \"offset\") from the plate to a rubber blanket. The blanket image becomes a mirror image of the plate image. An offset transfer moves the image to a printing substrate (typically paper), making the image right-reading again. Offset printing uses a lithographic process which is based on the repulsion of oil and water. The offset process employs a flat (planographic) image carrier (plate) which is mounted on a press cylinder. The image to be printed obtains ink from ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts an (acidic) film of water, keeping the non-image areas ink-free. Most offset presses use three cylinders: Plate, blanket, impression. Currently, most books and newspapers are printed using offset lithography.\nGravure.\nGravure printing is an intaglio printing technique, where the image being printed is made up of small depressions in the surface of the printing plate. The cells are filled with ink, and the excess is scraped off the surface with a doctor blade. Then a rubber-covered roller presses paper onto the surface of the plate and into contact with the ink in the cells. The printing cylinders are usually made from copper plated steel, which is subsequently chromed, and may be produced by diamond engraving; etching, or laser ablation.\nGravure printing is known for its ability to produce high-quality, high-resolution images with accurate color reproduction and using viscosity control equipment during production.\nInk evaporation control affects the change in the color of the printed image.\nGravure printing is used for long, high-quality print runs such as magazines, mail-order catalogues, packaging and printing onto fabric and wallpaper. It is also used for printing postage stamps and decorative plastic laminates, such as kitchen worktops.\nFlexography.\nFlexography is a type of relief printing. The relief plates are typically made from photopolymers.\nThe process is used for flexible packaging, corrugated board, labels, newspapers and more. In this market it competes with gravure printing by holding 80% of the market in US, 50% in Europe but only 20% in Asia.\nOther printing techniques.\nThe other significant printing techniques include:\nImpact of German movable type printing press.\nQuantitative aspects.\nIt is estimated that following the innovation of Gutenberg's printing press, the European book output rose from a few million to around one billion copies within a span of less than four centuries.\nReligious impact.\nSamuel Hartlib, who was exiled in Britain and enthusiastic about social and cultural reforms, wrote in 1641 that \"the art of printing will so spread knowledge that the common people, knowing their own rights and liberties, will not be governed by way of oppression\".\nIn the Muslim world, printing, especially in Arabic scripts, was strongly opposed throughout the early modern period, partially due to the high artistic renown of the art of traditional calligraphy. However, printing in Hebrew or Armenian script was often permitted. Thus, the first movable type printing in the Ottoman Empire was in Hebrew in 1493, after which both religious and non-religious texts were able to be printed in Hebrew. According to an imperial ambassador to Istanbul in the middle of the sixteenth century, it was a sin for the Turks, particularly Turkish Muslims, to print religious books. In 1515, Sultan Selim I issued a decree under which the practice of printing would be punishable by death. At the end of the sixteenth century, Sultan Murad III permitted the sale of non-religious printed books in Arabic characters, yet the majority were imported from Italy. Ibrahim Muteferrika established the first press for printing in Arabic in the Ottoman Empire, against opposition from the calligraphers and parts of the Ulama. It operated until 1742, producing altogether seventeen works, all of which were concerned with non-religious, utilitarian matters. Printing did not become common in the Islamic world until the 19th century.\nHebrew language printers were banned from printing guilds in some Germanic states; as a result, Hebrew printing flourished in Italy, beginning in 1470 in Rome, then spreading to other cities including Bari, Pisa, Livorno, and Mantua. Local rulers had the authority to grant or revoke licenses to publish Hebrew books, and many of those printed during this period carry the words 'con licenza de superiori' (indicating their printing having been officially licensed) on their title pages.\nIt was thought that the introduction of printing 'would strengthen religion and enhance the power of monarchs.' The majority of books were of a religious nature, with the church and crown regulating the content. The consequences of printing 'wrong' material were extreme. Meyrowitz used the example of William Carter who in 1584 printed a pro-Catholic pamphlet in Protestant-dominated England. The consequence of his action was hanging.\nSocial impact.\nPrint gave a broader range of readers access to knowledge and enabled later generations to build directly on the intellectual achievements of earlier ones without the changes arising within verbal traditions. Print, according to Acton in his 1895 lecture \"On the Study of History\", gave \"assurance that the work of the Renaissance would last, that what was written would be accessible to all, that such an occultation of knowledge and ideas as had depressed the Middle Ages would never recur, that not an idea would be lost\".\nPrint was instrumental in changing the social nature of reading.\nElizabeth Eisenstein identifies two long-term effects of the invention of printing. She claims that print created a sustained and uniform reference for knowledge and allowed comparisons of incompatible views.\nAsa Briggs and Peter Burke identify five kinds of reading that developed in relation to the introduction of print:\nThe invention of printing also changed the occupational structure of European cities. Printers emerged as a new group of artisans for whom literacy was essential, while the much more labour-intensive occupation of the scribe naturally declined. Proof-correcting arose as a new occupation, while a rise in the numbers of booksellers and librarians naturally followed the explosion in the numbers of books.\nEducational impact.\nGutenberg's printing press had profound impacts on universities as well. Universities were influenced in their \"language of scholarship, libraries, curriculum, [and] pedagogy\"\nThe language of scholarship.\nBefore the invention of the printing press, most written material was in Latin. However, after the invention of printing the number of books printed expanded as well as the vernacular. Latin was not replaced completely, but remained an international language until the eighteenth century.\nUniversity libraries.\nAt this time, universities began establishing accompanying libraries. \"Cambridge made the chaplain responsible for the library in the fifteenth century but this position was abolished in 1570 and in 1577 Cambridge established the new office of university librarian. Although, the University of Leuven did not see a need for a university library based on the idea that professor were the library. Libraries also began receiving so many books from gifts and purchases that they began to run out of room. However, the issue was solved in 1589 by a man named Merton who decided books should be stored on horizontal shelves rather than lecterns.\nCurriculum.\nThe printed press changed university libraries in many ways. Professors were finally able to compare the opinions of different authors rather than being forced to look at only one or two specific authors. Textbooks themselves were also being printed in different levels of difficulty, rather than just one introductory text being made available.\nDigital printing.\nBy 2005, digital printing accounted for approximately 9% of the 45\u00a0trillion pages printed annually around the world.\nPrinting at home, an office, or an engineering environment is subdivided into:\nSome of the more common printing technologies are:\nVendors typically stress the total cost to operate the equipment, involving complex calculations that include all cost factors involved in the operation as well as the capital equipment costs, amortization, etc. For the most part, toner systems are more economical than inkjet in the long run, even though inkjets are less expensive in the initial purchase price.\nProfessional digital printing (using toner) primarily uses an electrical charge to transfer toner or liquid ink to the substrate onto which it is printed. Digital print quality has steadily improved from early color and black and white copiers to sophisticated color digital presses such as the Xerox iGen3, the Kodak Nexpress, the HP Indigo Digital Press series, and the InfoPrint 5000. The iGen3 and Nexpress use toner particles and the Indigo uses liquid ink. The InfoPrint 5000 is a full-color, continuous forms inkjet drop-on-demand printing system. All handle variable data, and rival offset in quality. Digital offset presses are also called direct imaging presses, although these presses can receive computer files and automatically turn them into print-ready plates, they cannot insert variable data.\nSmall press and fanzines generally use digital printing. Prior to the introduction of cheap photocopying, the use of machines such as the spirit duplicator, hectograph, and mimeograph was common.\n3D printing.\n3D printing is a form of manufacturing technology where physical objects are created from three-dimensional digital models using 3D printers. The objects are created by laying down or building up many thin layers of material in succession. The technique is also known as additive manufacturing, rapid prototyping, or fabricating.\nIn the 1980s, 3D printing techniques were considered suitable only for the production of functional or aesthetic prototypes, and a more appropriate term for it at the time was rapid prototyping. As of 2019[ [update]], the precision, repeatability, and material range of 3D printing have increased to the point that some 3D printing processes are considered viable as an industrial-production technology, whereby the term \"additive manufacturing\" can be used synonymously with \"3D printing\". One of the key advantages of 3D printing is the ability to produce very complex shapes or geometries that would be otherwise infeasible to construct by hand, including hollow parts or parts with internal truss structures to reduce weight. Fused deposition modeling (FDM), which uses a continuous filament of a thermoplastic material, is the most common 3D printing process in use as of 2020[ [update]].\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMajor sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nEarly printers manuals.\nThe classic manual of early hand-press technology is\nTwo somewhat later ones, showing 18th and early 19th century developments are"}

It focuses on three decades in the life of the Marryots, an upper-middle-class British family, and their servants, beginning in 1900 and ending in 1930, a year before the premiere. It is set against major historical events of the period, including the Relief of Mafeking; the death of Queen Victoria; the sinking of the RMS \"Titanic\"; and World War I. The popular songs at the time of each event were interwoven into the score.\nThe play was premiered in London in 1931 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, directed by the author. The spectacular production presented by the impresario Charles B. Cochran, involved a huge cast and massive sets. The play was very successful and ran for almost a year. It took advantage of the large stage of the Drury Lane Theatre with its hydraulics and moving components to dramatise the events. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBackground and production.\nDuring the run of his successful comedy \"Private Lives\" in London in 1930, Coward discussed with the impresario C. B. Cochran the idea of a large, spectacular production to follow the intimate \"Private Lives\". He considered the idea of an epic set in the French revolution, but in an old copy of the \"Illustrated London News\" he saw a photograph of a troopship leaving for the Boer War, which gave him the idea for the new play. He outlined his scenario to Cochran and asked him to secure the Coliseum, London's largest theatre. Cochran was unable to do so, but was able to book the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, which was not much smaller, provided Coward could guarantee an approximate opening date. Coward and his designer Gladys Calthrop inspected Drury Lane and found it adequate in terms of the size of its stage and its technical facilities, although two extra hydraulic lifts had to be installed for quick changes of scenery, and unlike the Coliseum it lacked the revolving stage Coward wanted. While Calthrop began designing hundreds of costumes and twenty-two sets, Coward worked on the script, which he completed in August 1931.\nRehearsals began the following month. With four hundred cast and crew members involved in the production, Coward divided the crowd into groups of twenty and assigned each a leader. Because remembering individual names would be impossible, everyone was given a colour and number for easy identification, thus allowing Coward to direct \"Number 7 red\" to cross downstage and shake hands with \"Number 15 yellow and black\". Extras were encouraged to create their own bits of stage business, as long as it did not draw attention from the main action of the scene.\n\"Cavalcade\" premiered on 13 October 1931, starring Mary Clare and Edward Sinclair as the Marryot parents and featuring John Mills, Binnie Barnes, Una O'Connor, Moya Nugent, Arthur Macrae, Irene Browne and Maidie Andrews in supporting roles. Despite a brief delay caused by a mechanical problem early in the first act, the performance was a strong success, and the play went on to become one of the year's biggest West End hits, running for 405 performances. The play closed in September 1932.\nOriginal cast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCrowds, Soldiers, Sailors, Guests, etc.\nSynopsis.\nPart I.\nScene 1: Sunday 31 December 1899. The drawing-room of a London House.\nIt is nearly midnight. Robert and Jane Marryot are seeing in the New Year quietly together in their London house. Their happiness is clouded by the Boer War: Jane's brother is besieged in Mafeking, and Robert himself will shortly be going to South Africa. Robert and Jane invited their butler, Bridges, and his wife, Ellen, to join them. Bells, shouting, and sirens outside usher in the New Year, and Robert proposes a toast to 1900. Hearing her two boys stirring upstairs, Jane runs up to see after them, and her husband calls to her to bring them down to join the adults.\nScene 2: Saturday 27 January 1900. A dockside.\nA month later, a contingent of volunteers are leaving for the war. On the dockside Jane and Ellen are seeing off Robert and Bridges. As the men go aboard, Jane comforts Ellen, who is crying. A band strikes up \"Soldiers of the Queen\". The volunteers wave their farewells to the cheering crowd.\nScene 3: Friday 8 March 1900. The drawing-room of the Marryots' house.\nThe Marryot boys, Edward, aged twelve, and Joe, aged eight, are playing soldiers with a young friend, Edith Harris. She objects to being made to play \"the Boers\", and they begin to quarrel. The noise brings in their mothers. Joe throws a toy at Edith, and is sharply slapped by Jane, whose nerves are on edge with anxiety about her brother and her husband. Her state of mind is not helped by a barrel-organ outside, playing \"Soldiers of the Queen\" under the window. Margaret, Edith's mother, sends the organ-grinder away and proposes to take Jane to the theatre to take her mind off her worry.\nScene 4: Friday 8 May 1900. A theatre.\nJane and Margaret are in a stage-box, watching \"MirabeIle\", the currently popular musical comedy. The plot is the usual froth, but the denouement is not reached: the theatre manager comes onstage to announce that Mafeking has been relieved. Joyous uproar breaks out; the audience claps and cheers and some begin to sing \"Auld Lang Syne\".\nScene 5: Monday 21 January 1901. The kitchen of the Marryots' house.\nThe cook, Annie the parlourmaid, and Ellen's mother Mrs Snapper are preparing a special tea to greet Bridges on his return from the war. He comes in with Ellen, looking well, and kisses his little baby, Fanny. He tells them that he has bought a public house so that he and Ellen can work for themselves in future. The celebratory mood is dampened when Annie brings in a newspaper reporting that Queen Victoria is dying.\nScene 6: Sunday 27 January 1901. Kensington Gardens.\nThis scene is all in mime. Robert and Jane are walking in Kensington Gardens with their children when they meet Margaret and Edith Harris. Everyone is in black, solemn and silent, following the Queen's death.\nScene 7: Saturday 2 February 1901. The Marryots' drawing-room.\nOn the balcony, Jane, Margaret, their children and the servants are watching Queen Victoria's funeral procession. Robert, who was awarded the Victoria Cross is walking in the procession, and Jane has some difficulty in making her boys suppress their excitement and pay due respect as the coffin passes. As the lights fade, Joe comments, \"She must have been a very little lady \".\nScene 8: Thursday 14 May 1903. The grand staircase of a London house.\nJane and Robert are attending a grand ball given by the Duchess of Churt. The Major-domo announces, \"Sir Robert and Lady Marryot\".\nPart II.\nScene I: Saturday 16 June 1906. The bar parlour of a London public house.\nJane has brought her son Edward, now eighteen, to see Ellen in the flat above the public house. They have just finished tea, together with Flo and George, relations of the Bridges. Seven-year-old Fanny has been dancing to entertain them. Bridges enters, clearly drunk. Jane, dismayed, makes a tactful departure. Bridges starts to bully Fanny and is ejected from the room by George and Flo.\nScene 2: Saturday 16 June 1906. A London street (exterior of the public house).\nAfter emerging from the pub, Bridges carries on up the road. He is knocked down and killed by a car.\nScene 3: Wednesday 10 March 1909. The private room of a London restaurant.\nEdward Marryot is holding his twenty-first birthday party, with many smart young guests. Rose, an actress from the old \"Mirabelle\" production, proposes his health and sings the big waltz number from the show.\nScene 4: Monday 25 July 1910. The beach of a popular seaside resort.\nA concert party of six \"Uncles\" is performing in a bandstand. Ellen and her family are there and Fanny wins a prize for a song and dance competition. They unexpectedly meet Margaret, Jane and Joe. Ellen tells them that she has kept on the pub since her husband's death and that Fanny is now at a dancing-school and determined to go on the stage.\nScene 5: Sunday 14 April 1912. The deck of an Atlantic liner.\nEdward has married Edith Harris, and they are on their honeymoon. They speculate blithely how long the initial bliss of marriage will last. As they walk off, she lifts her cloak from where it has been draped on the ship rail, revealing the name \"Titanic\" on a lifebelt. The lights fade into complete darkness; the orchestra plays \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\" very quietly.\nScene 6: Tuesday 4 August 1914. The Marryots' drawing-room.\nWar has been declared. Robert and Joe are keen to join the army. Jane is horrified, and refuses to indulge in the jingoism she sees around her.\nScene 7: 1914\u20131915\u20131916\u20131917\u20131918. Marching.\nSoldiers are seen endlessly marching. The orchestra plays songs of the First World War.\nScene 8: Tuesday 22 October 1918. A restaurant.\nJoe and Fanny \u2013 now a rising young actress \u2013 are dining in a West End restaurant. Joe is in army officer's uniform. He is on leave but is about to return to the Front. They discuss marriage, but she envisages opposition from his family, and bids him wait until he is back from the war for good.\nScene 9: Tuesday 22 October 1918. A railway station.\nJane sees Joe off at the railway station. Like many of the women on the platform she is distressed.\nScene 10: Monday 11 November 1918. The Marryots' drawing-room.\nEllen visits Jane, having found out that Joe is emotionally involved with her daughter. The two mothers fall out: Ellen thinks Jane regards Fanny as beneath Joe socially. As Ellen is leaving, the maid brings in a telegram. Jane opens it and tells Ellen. \"You needn't worry about Fanny and Joe any more, Ellen. He won't be able to come back at all, because he's dead.\"\nScene 11: Monday 11 November 1918. Trafalgar Square.\nSurrounded by the frantic revelry of Armistice Night, Jane is walking, dazed, through Trafalgar Square. With tears streaming down her face, she cheers wildly and waves a rattle, while the band plays \"Land of Hope and Glory \".\nPart III.\nScene 1: Tuesday 31 December 1929. The Marryots' drawing room.\nMargaret and Jane, both now elderly, are sitting by the fire. Margaret leaves, after wishing a happy New Year to Jane and Robert, who has come in to drink a New Year toast with his wife. Jane drinks first to him and then to England: \"The hope that one day this country of ours, which we love so much, will find dignity and greatness, and peace again\".\nScene 2: Evening, 1930. A night club.\nRobert, Jane, Margaret, Ellen, and the full company are in a night club. At the piano, Fanny sings \"Twentieth Century Blues\", and after the song everyone dances.\nScene 3: Chaos.\nThe lights fade, and a chaotic succession of images representative of life in 1929 is spotlighted. When the noise and confusion reach a climax the stage suddenly fades into darkness and silence. At the back a Union Jack glows through the darkness. The scene ends with the lights coming up on the massed company singing \"God Save the King\".\nRevivals and adaptations.\nThe play was first revived in the West End in 1966, at the Scala Theatre, with a cast of 96 drama students from the Rose Bruford College. The reviewer in \"The Times\" found Coward's work remained \"dazzling and durable\". The first professional revival was in 1981 at the Redgrave Theatre in Farnham in a production directed by David Horlock and with a cast of 12 professional actors and 300 amateur performers. That production was filmed by the BBC and shown in 1982 as a two-part documentary, \"Cavalcade \u2013 A Backstage Story\". In 1995 a production starring Gabrielle Drake and Jeremy Clyde as Jane and Robert Maryott played at Sadler's Wells Theatre, London and on tour. The Citizens Theatre, Glasgow, presented the play in 1999, in a production by Philip Prowse.\nA film adaptation in 1933 won three Academy Awards, including \"Best Picture\". C. A. Lejeune called it \"the best British film that has ever been made\", and expressed exasperation that British studios had not taken the play up instead of allowing it to go to Hollywood. \"Cavalcade\" was adapted for BBC radio by Val Gielgud and Felix Felton and broadcast three times in 1936. A 1970s television series, \"Upstairs, Downstairs\", was to some extent based on the play.\nReception.\nOpening just before the British General Election, the play's strongly patriotic themes were credited by the Conservative Party for helping them secure a large percentage of the middle class votes, despite the fact Coward had conceived the project a full year before the election was held, and strenuously denied having any thought of influencing its outcome. King George V and Queen Mary attended the performance on election night and received Coward in the Royal Box during the second interval.\nIn \"The Daily Mail\" for 1 November 1931, Alan Parsons wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When the curtain fell last night at Drury Lane on Mr Noel Coward's \"Cavalcade\", there was an ovation such as I have not heard in very many years' playgoing. Mr Coward, after returning thanks to all concerned, said: \"After all, it is a pretty exciting thing in these days to be English\". And therein lies the whole secret of \"Cavalcade\"\u2014it is a magnificent play in which the note of national pride pervading every scene and every sentence must make each one of us face the future with courage and high hopes.\nReviewing the 1999 revival, Michael Billington wrote that it displayed the contradictory elements in Coward's writings, a show \"traditionally seen as a patriotic pageant about the first 30 years of the century\" but strongly anti-militaristic and portraying \"the anger that bubbles away among the working class\". He concluded, \"\"Cavalcade\" is actually about the way the high hopes at the start of the century have turned to senseless slaughter and hectic hedonism\".\nMusic.\nA record with the title \"Cavalcade Suite\" was made by the New Mayfair Orchestra. It contained a selection of the contemporary songs used in \"Cavalcade\", introduced by Coward. At the end he speaks the toast to England from the play. (HMV C2289)\nCoward himself recorded \"Lover of My Dreams\" (the Mirabelle Waltz Song), with, on the reverse, \"Twentieth Century Blues\", played by the New Mayfair Novelty Orchestra, with vocal by an unnamed singer identified by Mander and Mitchenson as Al Bowlly. (HMV B4001)\n\"Cavalcade\u2014Vocal Medley\": On this Coward sings \"Soldiers of the Queen\", \"Goodbye, Dolly\", \"Lover of My Dreams\", \"I do Like to be Beside the Seside\", \"Goodbye, My Bluebell\", \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\", \"Everybody's Doing It\", \"Let's All Go Down the Strand\", \"If You were the Only Girl\", \"Take Me Back to Dear Old Blighty\", \"There's a Long, Long Trail\", \"Keep the Home Fires Burning\", and \"Twentieth Century Blues\". (HMV C2431).\nCoward later recorded \"Twentieth Century Blues\" on the LP album \"No\u00ebl Coward in New York\", with an orchestra conducted by Peter Matz.

There are a variety of effects that can be called magnetoresistance. Some occur in bulk non-magnetic metals and semiconductors, such as geometrical magnetoresistance, Shubnikov\u2013de Haas oscillations, or the common positive magnetoresistance in metals. Other effects occur in magnetic metals, such as negative magnetoresistance in ferromagnets or anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). Finally, in multicomponent or multilayer systems (e.g. magnetic tunnel junctions), giant magnetoresistance (GMR), tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR), colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), and extraordinary magnetoresistance (EMR) can be observed.\nThe first magnetoresistive effect was discovered in 1856 by William Thomson, better known as Lord Kelvin, but he was unable to lower the electrical resistance of anything by more than 5%. Today, systems including semimetals and concentric ring EMR structures are known. In these, a magnetic field can adjust the resistance by orders of magnitude. Since different mechanisms can alter the resistance, it is useful to separately consider situations where it depends on a magnetic field directly (e.g. geometric magnetoresistance and multiband magnetoresistance) and those where it does so indirectly through magnetization (e.g. AMR and TMR).\nDiscovery.\nWilliam Thomson (Lord Kelvin) first discovered ordinary magnetoresistance in 1856. He experimented with pieces of iron and discovered that the resistance increases when the current is in the same direction as the magnetic force and decreases when the current is at 90\u00b0 to the magnetic force. He then did the same experiment with nickel and found that it was affected in the same way but the magnitude of the effect was greater. This effect is referred to as anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR).\nIn 2007, Albert Fert and Peter Gr\u00fcnberg were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery of giant magnetoresistance.\nGeometrical magnetoresistance.\nAn example of magnetoresistance due to direct action of magnetic field on electric current can be studied on a Corbino disc (see Figure).\nIt consists of a conducting annulus with perfectly conducting rims. Without a magnetic field, the battery drives a radial current between the rims. When a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the annulus is applied, (either into or out of the page) a circular component of current flows as well, due to Lorentz force. Initial interest in this problem began with Boltzmann in 1886, and independently was re-examined by Corbino in 1911.\nIn a simple model, supposing the response to the Lorentz force is the same as for an electric field, the carrier velocity v is given by:\nformula_1\nwhere \u03bc is the carrier mobility. Solving for the velocity, we find:\nformula_2\nwhere the effective reduction in mobility due to the B-field (for motion perpendicular to this field) is apparent. Electric current (proportional to the radial component of velocity) will decrease with increasing magnetic field and hence the resistance of the device will increase. Critically, this magnetoresistive scenario depends sensitively on the device geometry and current lines and it does not rely on magnetic materials.\nIn a semiconductor with a single carrier type, the magnetoresistance is proportional to (1 + (\"\u03bcB\")2), where \u03bc is the semiconductor mobility (units m2\u00b7V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121, equivalently m2\u00b7Wb\u22121, or T\u00a0\u22121) and B is the magnetic field (units teslas). Indium antimonide, an example of a high mobility semiconductor, could have an electron mobility above at . So in a field, for example the magnetoresistance increase would be 100%.\nAnisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR).\nThomson's experiments are an example of AMR, a property of a material in which a dependence of electrical resistance on the angle between the direction of electric current and direction of magnetization is observed. The effect arises in most cases from the simultaneous action of magnetization and spin\u2013orbit interaction (exceptions related to non-collinear magnetic order notwithstanding) and its detailed mechanism depends on the material. It can be for example due to a larger probability of s-d scattering of electrons in the direction of magnetization (which is controlled by the applied magnetic field). The net effect (in most materials) is that the electrical resistance has maximum value when the direction of current is parallel to the applied magnetic field. AMR of new materials is being investigated and magnitudes up to 50% have been observed in some uranium (but otherwise quite conventional) ferromagnetic compounds. Materials with extreme AMR have been identified driven by unconventional mechanisms such as a metal-insulator transition triggered by rotating the magnetic moments (while for some directions of magnetic moments, the system is semimetallic, for other directions a gap opens).\nIn polycrystalline ferromagnetic materials, the AMR can only depend on the angle \"\u03c6\" = \"\u03c8\" \u2212 \"\u03b8\" between the magnetization and current direction and (as long as the resistivity of the material can be described by a rank-two tensor), it must follow\nformula_3\nwhere \u03c1 is the (longitudinal) resistivity of the film and \"\u03c1\"\u2225,\u27c2 are the resistivities for \"\u03c6\" = 0\u00b0 and \"\u03c6\" = 90\u00b0, respectively. Associated with longitudinal resistivity, there is also transversal resistivity dubbed (somewhat confusingly) the planar Hall effect. In monocrystals, resistivity \u03c1 depends also on \u03c8 and \u03b8 individually.\nTo compensate for the non-linear characteristics and inability to detect the polarity of a magnetic field, the following structure is used for sensors. It consists of stripes of aluminum or gold placed on a thin film of permalloy (a ferromagnetic material exhibiting the AMR effect) inclined at an angle of 45\u00b0. This structure forces the current not to flow along the \"easy axes\" of thin film, but at an angle of 45\u00b0. The dependence of resistance now has a permanent offset which is linear around the null point. Because of its appearance, this sensor type is called 'barber pole'.\nThe AMR effect is used in a wide array of sensors for measurement of Earth's magnetic field (electronic compass), for electric current measuring (by measuring the magnetic field created around the conductor), for traffic detection and for linear position and angle sensing. The biggest AMR sensor manufacturers are Honeywell, NXP Semiconductors, STMicroelectronics, and http://.\nAs theoretical aspects, I. A. Campbell, A. Fert, and O. Jaoul (&lt;dfn &gt;CFJ&lt;/dfn&gt;) derived an expression of the AMR ratio for Ni-based alloys using the two-current model with s-s and s-d scattering processes, where 's' is a conduction electron, and 'd' is 3d states with the spin-orbit interaction. The AMR ratio is expressed as\nformula_4\nwith formula_5 and formula_6, where formula_7, formula_8, and formula_9 are a spin-orbit coupling constant (so-called formula_10), an exchange field, and a resistivity for spin formula_11, respectively. In addition, recently, Satoshi Kokado et al. have obtained the general expression of the AMR ratio for 3d transition-metal ferromagnets by extending the CFJ theory to a more general one. The general expression can also be applied to half-metals.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the capital city of the province of Burgos, and with a population of 176,551, also the largest city in the province, and the 37th-largest in Spain.\nBurgos is situated in the north of the Iberian Peninsula, on the confluence of the Arlanz\u00f3n river tributaries and at the edge of the central plateau. The Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route runs through Burgos.\nFounded in 885 by the second Count of Castile, Diego Rodr\u00edguez Porcelos, Burgos soon became the leading city of the embryonic County of Castile. The 11th century chieftain Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar (\"El Cid\") had connections with the city: born near Burgos, he was raised and educated there. Burgos experienced a long decline from the 17th century onwards.\nBurgos became the headquarters of the Francoist proto-government (1936\u20131939) following the start of the Spanish Civil War. Declared in 1964 as Pole of Industrial Promotion and in 1969 as Pole of Industrial Development, the city has grown since then in terms of economic activity. At the regional level, Burgos forms part of an economic axis together with the cities of Valladolid and Palencia. In 2008, the international Burgos Airport started to service commercial flights.\nThe Museum of Human Evolution opened in Burgos in 2010. It features remains of the first hominids in Europe, who lived in the area 750,000\u2013800,000 years ago. The Cathedral of Burgos is a World Heritage Site. Burgos was selected as the \"Spanish Gastronomy Capital\" of 2013. In 2015 UNESCO named it \"City of Gastronomy\", and it has been part of the Creative Cities Network since then.\nEtymology.\nThere are several possible origins for the toponymy. When the city was founded, the inhabitants of the surrounding country moved into the fortified village, whose Visigothic name of Burgos signified consolidated walled villages (Gothic \"baurgs\"). The cities Burgas in Bulgaria and numerous cities containing the Germanic burg \"city\" such as Hamburg have a similar literal composition. The city began to be called \"Caput Castellae\" (\"Cabeza de Castilla\" or \"Head of Castile\").\nHistory.\nEarly humans occupied sites around Burgos as early as 800,000 years ago.\nWhen the Romans took possession of what is now the province of Burgos, the site had been a Celtic city. In Roman times, it belonged to Hispania Citerior (\"Hither Spain\") and then to Hispania Tarraconensis. In the 5th century, the Visigoths drove back the Suebi, then the Berbers occupied almost all of Castile in the 8th century, though only for a very brief period, and left little if any trace of their occupation. King Alfonso III the Great of Le\u00f3n reconquered it about the middle of the 9th century, and built several castles for the defence of Christendom, which was then extended through the reconquest of lost territory. The region came to be known as Castile (Latin \"castella\"), i.e. \"(land of) castles\".\nBurgos was founded in 884 as an outpost of this expanding Christian frontier, when Diego Rodr\u00edguez \"Porcelos\", count of Castile, governed this territory with orders to promote the increase of the Christian population; with this end in view he gathered the inhabitants of the surrounding country into one fortified village. The city began to be called \"Caput Castellae\" (\"Cabeza de Castilla\" or \"Head of Castile\"). The county (\"condado\") of Castile, subject to the Kings of Le\u00f3n, continued to be governed by counts and was gradually extended; one of these counts, Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, established his independence.\nIn the 11th century, the city became the see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burgos and the capital of the Kingdom of Castile. Burgos was a major stop for pilgrims on the French Way the most popular path to Santiago de Compostela and a centre of trade between the Bay of Biscay and the south, which attracted an unusually large foreign merchant population, who became part of the city oligarchy and excluded other foreigners. Throughout the 13th and 14th centuries, Burgos was a favourite seat of the kings of Le\u00f3n and Castile and a favoured burial site. The \"consejo\" or urban commune of Burgos was firmly in the hands of an oligarchic class of \"caballeros villanos\", the \"peasant knights\" of Burgos, who provided the monarchs with a mounted contingent: in 1255 and 1266 royal charters granted relief from taxes to those citizens of Burgos who owned horses and could arm themselves, provided that they continue to live within the city walls. The merchant oligarchy succeeded the cathedral chapter as the major purchasers of land after 1250; they carried on their mercantile business in common with municipal or royal functions and sent their sons to England and Flanders to gain experience in overseas trade. A few families within the \"hermandades\" or confraternities like the Sarrac\u00edn and Bonifaz succeeded in monopolising the post of \"alcalde\", or mayor; a special court, the \"alcalde del rey\" was first mentioned at Burgos in 1281. By the reign of Alfonso X, the exemption of the non-noble knights and religious corporations, combined with exorbitant gifts and grants to monasteries and private individuals, placed great stress on the economic well-being of the realm.\nIn the century following the conquest of Seville (1248) from the Moors, Burgos became a testing ground for royal policies of increasing power against the \"consejo\", in part by encouraging the right to appeal from the \"consejo\" to the king. In 1285, Sancho IV added a new body to the \"consejo\" which came to dominate it: the \"jurado\" in charge of collecting taxes and overseeing public works; the king reserved the right to select its members. The city perceived that danger to its autonomy came rather from an uncontrolled aristocracy during royal minorities: Burgos joined the \"hermandades\" of cities that leagued together for mutual protection in 1295 and 1315. In the 14th century, official royal intrusion in city affairs was perceived as a palliative against outbreaks of violence by the large excluded class of smaller merchants and artisans, on whom the tax burden fell. The \"alguacil\" was the royal official instituted to judge disagreements.\nOn 9 June 1345, sweeping aside the city government, Alfonso XI established direct royal rule of Burgos through the \"Regimiento\" of sixteen appointed men.\nIn 1574, Pope Gregory XIII made the bishopric a Metropolitan archbishopric, at the request of king Felipe II.\nBurgos has been the scene of many wars: with the Moors, the struggles between Le\u00f3n and Navarre, and between Castile and Aragon. In the Peninsular War against Napoleonic France, the siege of Burgos (between 19 September to 21 October) was a scene of a withdrawal for Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Again in the 19th-century Carlist civil wars of the Spanish succession Burgos was the scene of a battle. During the Spanish Civil War, Burgos was the base of General Franco's rebel nationalist government.\nJewish History.\nHistorically, there was a large and thriving Jewish community in Burgos. Its first documentation dates to 974. In the 13th century, Burgos was the largest Jewish center in northern Castile. Renowned Talmudists Meir Abulafia, Todros ben Joseph Abulafia, and poet Todros ben Judah Halevi Abulafia were born in Burgos. In the latter half of the 13th century, many kabbalists began moving to Burgos. After new restrictions were imposed on Jews, and they began to suffer from more violent acts of antisemitism, many converted to Christianity. The most well-known convert from Burgos, Paul of Burgos, was originally a Spanish Jew named Solomon Halevi. During the Edict of Expulsion in 1492, most Jews in Burgos became conversos rather than fleeing Spain. Those who did went to Portugal.\nClimate.\nAt an elevation of , the city of Burgos has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Csb\", with some continental influence resulting from its distance from the sea and higher altitude. It features chilly and windy winters, due to altitude and an inland location, which always include snow and temperatures below freezing. Burgos is considered the coldest city in Spain, among cities with a population of more than 100,000 inhabitants. Temperature ranges can be extreme and Burgos is drier than Spain's coastal regions, although there is year-round precipitation. Average annual precipitation is and the average annual relative humidity is 72%. In winter, temperatures very often (almost every day) drop below freezing, often reaching temperatures as low as , and snowfalls are common, while the summer months see average high temperatures of . The lowest recorded temperature in Burgos was on 3 January 1971. The highest recorded temperature was on 13 August 1987.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of 2024, the population of Burgos is 176,551, of whom 47.6% are male and 52.4% are female, compared to the nationwide average of 49.0% and 51.0% respectively. People under 16 years old make up 13.9% of the population, and people over 65 years old make up 24.5%, compared to the nationwide average of 14.3% and 20.4% respectively.\nAs of 2024, the foreign-born population is 23,671, equal to 13.4% of the total population. The 5 largest foreign nationalities are Colombians (3,937), Romanians (2,478), Ecuadorians (1,983), Venezuelans (1,830) and Moroccans (1,471).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSights.\nBurgos is rich in ancient churches and convents. The three most notable are the cathedral, with its chapel of the Condestables de Castilla (Lords Constable of Castile), the monastery of Las Huelgas and the Carthusian monastery of Miraflores. Minor notable churches are San Esteban, San Gil (Sancti Aegidii), San Pedro, San Cosme y San Dami\u00e1n, Santiago (Sancti Jacobi), San Lorenzo and San Lesmes (Adelelmi). The Convento de la Merced, occupied by the Jesuits, and the Hospital del Rey are also of historic and architectural interest.\nAmong the other interesting architectural structures, in the walls of the city are the gateway of Santa Mar\u00eda, erected for the first entrance of the Emperor Charles V, and the arch of Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez.\nGothic Cathedral.\nConstruction on Burgos' Gothic Cathedral began in 1221 and spanned mainly from the 13th to 15th centuries. It has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Cathedral is the resting place for El Cid (the famous knight from Medieval Spain's history) and his wife Do\u00f1a Jimena. The west front is flanked by towers terminating in octagonal spires covered with open stonework traceries. The middle section, which serves as an entrance, has three alabaster pilasters, the intercolumnar spaces bearing panel-pictures representing the martyrdom of saints. The fa\u00e7ade possesses ornate and fantastic surface decoration.\nThe octagonal chapel of the Condestable, in florid, thus highly sculpted, Gothic design, has a roof finished with balustraded turrets, needle-pointed pinnacles and statues. In the lower portion, coats of arms, shields and crouching lions have been worked into the ensemble. The exterior of the sacristy is decorated with carved traceries, figures of angels and armoured knights. The elaborate tabernacle is composed of two octagonal sections in Corinthian style.\nMonasterio de las Huelgas.\nThe \"Monasterio de las Huelgas Reales\" (Monastery of the Royal Retreats) on the outskirts of the city, was founded in 1180 by king Alfonso VIII, and was begun in a pre-Gothic style, although almost every style has been introduced over many additions. The remarkable cloisters have been described as \"unrivalled for beauty both of detail and design, and perhaps unsurpassed by anything in its age and style in any part of Europe\" (1911 \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\"). One cloister has semicircular arches with delicate and varied columns; the other has an ogival style of early Gothic. The interior of the church has enormous columns supporting its magnificent vault; the entrance is modern. This convent historically benefited from extraordinary privileges granted to its abbess by kings and popes.\nMiraflores Charterhouse.\nThe Carthusian monastery, Miraflores Charterhouse (\"Cartuja de Miraflores\") is situated about four kilometres from the historic city center. Among the treasures of the Charterhouse are the wooden statue of St. Bruno, the wooden choir stalls in the church and the tombs of King Juan II and of his spouse, Queen Isabella of Portugal, constructed of marble and with their recumbent effigies sculpted in alabaster. Around the top frieze are statues of angels in miniature. The French soldiers in the Spanish War of Independence (1814) mutilated this work, cutting off some of the heads and carrying them away to France. King Juan II's daughters by his first wife, heiresses Princesses Catherine and Eleanor of Asturias, are also buried in the monastery.\nCastle.\nLocated on a hill 75 meters above the city, it is a medieval defensive fortress built during the time of the reconquest. Used by Castilian kings as accommodation and a place for celebrations, it later became an artillery fort and then a weapons factory. After its destruction by the French during the War of Independence in 1813, there are hardly any buildings left standing. From the Castle it is possible to see fantastic views of the city.\nMuseums.\nBurgos has a total of 10 museums, the newest being the Museum of Human Evolution (the 10th most visited museum in Spain).\nMuseum of Human Evolution.\nThe Museum of Human Evolution was inaugurated on 13 July 2010. Its foundation is based on the archaeological site of Atapuerca located east of Burgos. The Atapuerca site has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It contains several caves, where fossils and stone tools of the earliest known hominids in West Europe have been found, near Atapuerca Mountains.\nThe museum also allows the visitor to travel to the archaeological site and biological park.\nMuseum of Burgos.\nIt summarizes the history of the province of Burgos. It has important objects and documents from all the ages, starting from Atapuerca, passing to the Romans and Iberians, and finishing in the contemporary period. These include the traditional sword of El Cid.\nThe museum is located in the renaissances palaces, the House of \u00cd\u00f1igo Angulo and the House of Miranda, which has a main patio that structures the museum.\nBook Museum.\nBetween the Main Square \"Plaza Mayor\" and the Promenade of the Espol\u00f3n \"Paseo del Espol\u00f3n,\" on the side street, Traves\u00eda del Mercado n\u00ba3, you find the Fadrique de Basilea Book Museum \"Museo del Libro Fadrique de Basilea\", of the Burgos publisher, Silo\u00e9, a cosy museum that shows the history of the book from its first written form to its modern electronic form.\nEducation.\nState Education in Spain is free, and compulsory from 6 to 16 years. The current education system is called LOE (\"Ley Org\u00e1nica de Educaci\u00f3n\").\nUniversities.\nOften abbreviated 'UBU', the University of Burgos is a public university with about 10,000 students studying over 30 different undergraduate degrees, over 20 PhD Programmes, as well as several Official Masters and other graduate courses. It was established in 1994 when it was divided from the University of Valladolid.\nUBU cooperates with the Erasmus Project, a European Union (EU) student-exchange programme, and each semester hosts students from various countries across the 15-state European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Malta and associated countries in Eastern Europe. Additionally, university students from various regions around the world including China, Latin and North America are able to participate in exchange programmes to study abroad at the University of Burgos. In total, the University of Burgos has education agreements with over 100 international academic institutions.\nIsabella I of Castile University\nIsabella I of Castile University, established in 2008, is a private state-recognized university located in Burgos. It was fully accredited by the Spanish Government in 2011.\nParks and recreation.\nMost of the parks in the city of Burgos can be found along the river Arlanz\u00f3n. Indeed, the banks of the river itself constitute a green corridor along the city. In total, there are nearly 3 square miles (1,878 acres) of parks in Burgos and one tree for every 3 inhabitants.\nEconomy.\nBurgos is one of Spain's richest cities, with a GDP above the Spain average. It is an important trade and tourist center with a sizeable manufacturing base.\nAgriculture.\nWheat is a major crop. The city is surrounded by wheat fields.\nSecondary sector.\nBurgos is a very industrial city, with a secondary sector widely developed. The city has the biggest industrial park of north Spain, called \"Villalonqu\u00e9jar\".\nThe city is the headquarters of Grupo Antolin, designer and manufacturer of interior automotive components.\nIt is also the headquarters for south Europe Benteler International.\nTertiary sector.\nIt employs the bigger percentage in the city and is represented by the public sector (production, delivery and allocation of goods and services), due to the capital status.\nCulture.\nThe city has a complete culture infrastructure, remarked by the Auditorio y Palacio de Congresos de Burgos, which opened in mid-2012.\nLanguage.\nSpanish, also called Castilian, originated in Castile and spread throughout the Crown of Castile's possessions following the reconquista. It was eventually dispersed throughout the Spanish empire following the conquest and colonization of the Americas, and Spain after the union of the Catholic Monarchs's kingdoms being co-spoken with other languages. Of the many different variations and dialects found throughout the world, it's argued that the purest Spanish can be found in the region of Burgos due to the fact that the language first developed here in the 10th century.\nThe Spanish language can be traced back to the monastery of Valpuesta located north-east of the city of Burgos. The Valpuesta cartularies are significant in the history of the Spanish language, and their status as manuscripts containing the earliest words written in Spanish has been officially recognised.\nThe first utterings of Spanish continued in the \"Silos Glosses\", recorded in the Burgos monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos.\nCuisine.\nBurgos province is famous in gastronomy for:\nQueso de Burgos, a white cheese which is soft and unctuous (because it is made with whey). Although originally made with sheep's milk, now cow's milk or mixtures are more common. Each \"comarca\" (rural district) produces a minor variation, and the major dairies produce an industrial product that is acceptable for people with sensitive digestion.\nBurgos is blessed with a moderate climate and this fresh cheese was able to be conserved there without the need for curing of more than 10 days. With the improvement of aseptic industrial production processes this can be extended to about 30 days at a cool 6\u00a0\u00b0C. Its production reaches 35,000 tons annually.\nMorcilla de Burgos, a pig's-blood sausage (black pudding), is a staple country food known across the Iberian peninsula. Spiced with onions and herbs its most noticeable content is rice (often mistaken for fat) which makes it one of the lightest and healthiest products of its kind. Oral tradition says that it must be \"salty, smooth and piquant\" (see Spanish pages Burgos (desambiguaci\u00f3n) for details). As with the Queso de Burgos, several comarcas or towns in the province (Carde\u00f1adijo, Sotopalacios, Aranda de Duero, Briviesca, Covarrubias, Villarcayo, Trespaderne, Miranda de Ebro...) made their own morcillas, with minor variations between them.\nEven though Burgos is not on a D.O. wine is a fundamental piece in local gastronomy thanks to nearby wine cellars from Ribera de Duero, Rioja and Arlanza D.O.\nFestivals.\nThe city's main festival is San Pedro y San Pablo (also referred to locally as \"Sampedros\") celebrated on June 29. Every year, for about two weeks, the city celebrates with fireworks, concerts, sports, folklore, games for children, theater and other activities.\nTransport.\nAir.\nBurgos Airport is located only from the city centre, which only provides seasonal flights to Palma de Mallorca that are operated by Iberia. Other nearby airports are Valladolid Airport, located south west, Bilbao Airport, located north east and Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport, located south of Burgos.\nRailway.\nThe city is considered a first-class rail route through which one rail lines circulate, operated by Renfe: Madrid\u2013Hendaye railway. The faster trains use the AVE line between Madrid and Valladolid.\n2010 marked 150 years since the arrival of the first railway to the city; the first train was present on 25 October 1860. Madrid was joined with the French border and this was considered the main route of railway communication between Spain and Europe. Located at the halfway point, Burgos soon become an important hub of communications between the centre and the north.\nSince December 2007, the city has been connected to the main provincial capitals by high-speed service Alvia. It also provides other services, middle and long distance, which connect with the main population centres of the country. 18 long distance trains and 12 middle distance trains circulate through the station each day, which results in around 330,000 yearly users.\nThe new railway station was opened on 12 December 2008 under the name Burgos-Rosa de Lima, belonging to ADIF. It is located in the neighbourhood of Vill\u00edmar, northeast of the city, and was adapted for the arrival of AVE. Bus 25 takes travellers direct to the city centre.\nIn July 2022, AVE high speed trains started serving the city, connecting it to cities such as Madrid in 1 hour and 33 minutes with a stop in Valladolid, or Bilbao in 70 minutes. Starting in January 2023, AVE will connect Burgos to Valencia in 3 hours and 30 minutes without the need to transfer in Madrid.\nTrams.\nA project to implement a tram for the city has been planned, which would run the length of the Boulevard, officially called the Avenida de Valencia. It would consist of a line of about long and will originate from the Burgos-Rosa de Lima railway station and end at the University of Burgos. Its cost is estimated between 80 and 120 million euros.\nDue to the economic crisis and real estate, the project has been postponed temporarily until further funding becomes available. In February 2010 work began on the development of the Boulevard, which reserves a lane for public transport: first buses, and eventually the tram.\nBus.\nBurgos has an international bus station located in the city centre, just one hundred meters from the Cathedral. It connects the city with nearly every region of Spain, as well as with a wide number of European (Amsterdam, Basel, Bern, Bratislava, Brussels, Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Geneva, Gda\u0144sk, Kyiv, Lisbon, Ljubljana, Lviv, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, London, Lyon, Marseille, Moscow, Munich, Nice, Paris, Porto, Prague, Rotterdam, Sofia, The Hague, Warsaw, Zurich) and even North African (Casablanca, Marrakesh, Rabat) cities.\nBicycle.\nThe city has its own public bicycle rental system, called \"Bicibur\". It has been designed by a local company and has more than 20 points of distribution throughout the city. A network of over of bicycle lanes net the city making it the 6th largest bicycle lane network in Spain and the first in kilometres per resident.\nSports.\nThe first football team in the city, Burgos CF, was founded in 1936, reaching the top division for six seasons in the late 1970s, before disappearing due to serious economic debts in 1983. It was replaced as the main football team of the city by its reserve team, renamed Real Burgos CF, which itself ceased to compete in 1994, after three successful seasons at the top flight. A new incarnation of Burgos CF was immediately refounded, but didn't start to compete until the 1994 season, in the sixth-tier \"Primera Provincial\" division. The team gradually transformed into professionalism, and since 2021 it plays in the second division of the Spanish football pyramid, hosting games at the El Plant\u00edo stadium.\nThe city has two professional basketball teams, CB San Pablo and CB Tizona, both playing (as of 2024) in the second division of the Spanish basketball league system.\nIn popular culture.\nSegundo de Chom\u00f3n filmed a short documentary about Burgos in 1911.\nScenes from \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" were filmed near Burgos, which doubled for the Southwestern United States. The location called Sad Hill Cemetery (specifically in Santo Domingo de Silos), was where the last sequence of the film was shot.\nBurgos is the setting for a scene in the 2010 film \"The Way\", directed by Emilio Estevez and starring his father Martin Sheen.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nBurgos is twinned with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a common substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and aragonite, most notably in chalk and limestone, eggshells, gastropod shells, shellfish skeletons and pearls. Materials containing much calcium carbonate or resembling it are described as calcareous. Calcium carbonate is the active ingredient in agricultural lime and is produced when calcium ions in hard water react with carbonate ions to form limescale. It has medical use as a calcium supplement or as an antacid, but excessive consumption can be hazardous and cause hypercalcemia and digestive issues.\nChemistry.\nCalcium carbonate shares the typical properties of other carbonates. Notably, it:\nCalcium carbonate reacts with water that is saturated with carbon dioxide to form the soluble calcium bicarbonate.\nThis reaction is important in the erosion of carbonate rock, forming caverns, and leads to hard water in many regions.\nAn unusual form of calcium carbonate is the hexahydrate ikaite, . Ikaite is stable only below 8\u00a0\u00b0C.\nPreparation.\nThe vast majority of calcium carbonate used in industry is extracted by mining or quarrying. Pure calcium carbonate (such as for food or pharmaceutical use), can be produced from a pure quarried source (usually marble).\nAlternatively, calcium carbonate is prepared from calcium oxide. Water is added to give calcium hydroxide then carbon dioxide is passed through this solution to precipitate the desired calcium carbonate, referred to in the industry as precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). This process is called carbonatation:\n\nIn a laboratory, calcium carbonate can easily be crystallized from calcium chloride (), by placing an aqueous solution of in a desiccator alongside ammonium carbonate . In the desiccator, ammonium carbonate is exposed to air and decomposes into ammonia, carbon dioxide, and water. The carbon dioxide then diffuses into the aqueous solution of calcium chloride, reacts with the calcium ions and the water, and forms calcium carbonate.\nStructure.\nThe thermodynamically stable form of under normal conditions is hexagonal \u03b2- (the mineral calcite). Other forms can be prepared, the denser (2.83\u00a0g/cm3) orthorhombic \u03bb- (the mineral aragonite) and hexagonal \u03bc-, occurring as the mineral vaterite. The aragonite form can be prepared by precipitation at temperatures above 85\u00a0\u00b0C; the vaterite form can be prepared by precipitation at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. Calcite contains calcium atoms coordinated by six oxygen atoms; in aragonite they are coordinated by nine oxygen atoms. The vaterite structure is not fully understood. Magnesium carbonate () has the calcite structure, whereas strontium carbonate () and barium carbonate () adopt the aragonite structure, reflecting their larger ionic radii.\nPolymorphs.\nCalcium carbonate crystallizes in three anhydrous polymorphs, of which calcite is the thermodynamically most stable at room temperature, aragonite is only slightly less so, and vaterite is the least stable.\nCrystal structure.\nThe calcite crystal structure is trigonal, with space group R3c (No. 167 in the International Tables for Crystallography), and Pearson symbol hR10. Aragonite is orthorhombic, with space group Pmcn (No 62), and Pearson Symbol oP20. Vaterite is composed of at least two different coexisting crystallographic structures. The major structure exhibits hexagonal symmetry in space group P63/mmc, the minor structure is still unknown.\nCrystallization.\nAll three polymorphs crystallize simultaneously from aqueous solutions under ambient conditions. In additive-free aqueous solutions, calcite forms easily as the major product, while aragonite appears only as a minor product.\nAt high saturation, vaterite is typically the first phase precipitated, which is followed by a transformation of the vaterite to calcite. This behavior seems to follow Ostwald's rule, in which the least stable polymorph crystallizes first, followed by the crystallization of different polymorphs via a sequence of increasingly stable phases. However, aragonite, whose stability lies between those of vaterite and calcite, seems to be the exception to this rule, as aragonite does not form as a precursor to calcite under ambient conditions.\nAragonite occurs in majority when the reaction conditions inhibit the formation of calcite and/or promote the nucleation of aragonite. For example, the formation of aragonite is promoted by the presence of magnesium ions, or by using proteins and peptides derived from biological calcium carbonate. Some polyamines such as cadaverine and Poly(ethylene imine) have been shown to facilitate the formation of aragonite over calcite. Solid\u2011state NMR analysis has revealed that poly\u2011aspartate-stabilized ACC contains water molecules that undergo millisecond-timescale flips, illustrating dynamic hydration as a key factor in delaying crystallization.\nSelection by organisms.\nOrganisms, such as molluscs and arthropods, have shown the ability to grow all three crystal polymorphs of calcium carbonate, mainly as protection (shells) and muscle attachments. Moreover, they exhibit a remarkable capability of phase selection over calcite and aragonite, and some organisms can switch between the two polymorphs. The ability of phase selection is usually attributed to the use of specific macromolecules or combinations of macromolecules by such organisms.\nOccurrence.\nGeological sources.\nCalcite, aragonite and vaterite are pure calcium carbonate minerals. Industrially important source rocks which are predominantly calcium carbonate include limestone, chalk, marble and travertine.\nBiological sources.\nEggshells, snail shells and most seashells are predominantly calcium carbonate and can be used as industrial sources of that chemical. Oyster shells have enjoyed recent recognition as a source of dietary calcium, but are also a practical industrial source. Dark green vegetables such as broccoli and kale contain dietarily significant amounts of calcium carbonate, but they are not practical as an industrial source.\nAnnelids in the family Lumbricidae, earthworms, possess a regionalization of the digestive track called calciferous glands, Kalkdr\u00fcsen, or glandes de Morren, that processes calcium and into calcium carbonate, which is later excreted into the dirt. The function of these glands is unknown but is believed to serve as a regulation mechanism within the animals' tissues. This process is ecologically significant, stabilizing the pH of acid soils.\nExtraterrestrial.\nBeyond Earth, strong evidence suggests the presence of calcium carbonate on Mars. Signs of calcium carbonate have been detected at more than one location (notably at Gusev and Huygens craters). This provides some evidence for the past presence of liquid water.\nGeology.\nCarbonate is found frequently in geologic settings and constitutes an enormous carbon reservoir. Calcium carbonate occurs as aragonite, calcite and dolomite as significant constituents of the calcium cycle. The carbonate minerals form the rock types: limestone, chalk, marble, travertine, tufa, and others.\nIn warm, clear tropical waters corals are more abundant than towards the poles where the waters are cold. Calcium carbonate contributors, including plankton (such as coccoliths and planktic foraminifera), coralline algae, sponges, brachiopods, echinoderms, bryozoa and mollusks, are typically found in shallow water environments where sunlight and filterable food are more abundant. Cold-water carbonates do exist at higher latitudes but have a very slow growth rate. The calcification processes are changed by ocean acidification.\nWhere the oceanic crust is subducted under a continental plate sediments will be carried down to warmer zones in the asthenosphere and lithosphere. Under these conditions calcium carbonate decomposes to produce carbon dioxide which, along with other gases, give rise to explosive volcanic eruptions.\nCarbonate compensation depth.\nThe carbonate compensation depth (CCD) is the point in the ocean where the rate of precipitation of calcium carbonate is balanced by the rate of dissolution due to the conditions present. Deep in the ocean, the temperature drops and pressure increases. Increasing pressure also increases the solubility of calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate is unusual in that its solubility increases with decreasing temperature. The carbonate compensation depth ranges from 4,000 to 6,000 meters below sea level in modern oceans, and the various polymorphs (calcite, aragonite) have different compensation depths based on their stability.\nRole in taphonomy.\nCalcium carbonate can preserve fossils through permineralization. Most of the vertebrate fossils of the Two Medicine Formation\u2014a geologic formation known for its duck-billed dinosaur eggs\u2014are preserved by permineralization. This type of preservation conserves high levels of detail, even down to the microscopic level. However, it also leaves specimens vulnerable to weathering when exposed to the surface.\nTrilobite populations were once thought to have composed the majority of aquatic life during the Cambrian, due to the fact that their calcium carbonate-rich shells were more easily preserved than those of other species, which had purely chitinous shells.\nUses.\nConstruction.\nThe main use of calcium carbonate is in the construction industry, either as a building material, or limestone aggregate for road building, as an ingredient of cement, or as the starting material for the preparation of builders' lime by burning in a kiln. However, because of weathering mainly caused by acid rain, calcium carbonate (in limestone form) is no longer used for building purposes on its own, but only as a raw primary substance for building materials.\nCalcium carbonate is also used in the purification of iron from iron ore in a blast furnace. The carbonate is calcined \"in situ\" to give calcium oxide, which forms a slag with various impurities present, and separates from the purified iron.\nIn the oil industry, calcium carbonate is added to drilling fluids as a formation-bridging and filtercake-sealing agent; it is also a weighting material which increases the density of drilling fluids to control the downhole pressure. Calcium carbonate is added to swimming pools, as a pH corrector for maintaining alkalinity and offsetting the acidic properties of the disinfectant agent.\nIt is also used as a raw material in the refining of sugar from sugar beet; it is calcined in a kiln with anthracite to produce calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. This burnt lime is then slaked in fresh water to produce a calcium hydroxide suspension for the precipitation of impurities in raw juice during carbonatation.\nCalcium carbonate in the form of chalk has traditionally been a major component of blackboard chalk. However, modern manufactured chalk is mostly gypsum, hydrated calcium sulfate . Calcium carbonate is a main source for growing biorock. Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC), pre-dispersed in slurry form, is a common filler material for latex gloves with the aim of achieving maximum saving in material and production costs.\nFine ground calcium carbonate (GCC) is an essential ingredient in the microporous film used in diapers and some building films, as the pores are nucleated around the calcium carbonate particles during the manufacture of the film by biaxial stretching. GCC and PCC are used as a filler in paper because they are cheaper than wood fiber. Printing and writing paper can contain 10\u201320% calcium carbonate. In North America, calcium carbonate has begun to replace kaolin in the production of glossy paper. Europe has been practicing this as alkaline papermaking or acid-free papermaking for some decades. PCC used for paper filling and paper coatings is precipitated and prepared in a variety of shapes and sizes having characteristic narrow particle size distributions and equivalent spherical diameters of 0.4 to 3 micrometers.\nCalcium carbonate is widely used as an extender in paints, in particular matte emulsion paint where typically 30% by weight of the paint is either chalk or marble. It is also a popular filler in plastics. Some typical examples include around 15\u201320% loading of chalk in unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC) drainpipes, 5\u201315% loading of stearate-coated chalk or marble in uPVC window profile. PVC cables can use calcium carbonate at loadings of up to 70\u00a0phr (parts per hundred parts of resin) to improve mechanical properties (tensile strength and elongation) and electrical properties (volume resistivity). Polypropylene compounds are often filled with calcium carbonate to increase rigidity, a requirement that becomes important at high usage temperatures. Here the percentage is often 20\u201340%. It also routinely used as a filler in thermosetting resins (sheet and bulk molding compounds) and has also been mixed with ABS, and other ingredients, to form some types of compression molded \"clay\" poker chips. Precipitated calcium carbonate, made by dropping calcium oxide into water, is used by itself or with additives as a white paint, known as whitewashing.\nCalcium carbonate is added to a wide range of trade and do it yourself adhesives, sealants, and decorating fillers. Ceramic tile adhesives typically contain 70% to 80% limestone. Decorating crack fillers contain similar levels of marble or dolomite. It is also mixed with putty in setting stained glass windows, and as a resist to prevent glass from sticking to kiln shelves when firing glazes and paints at high temperature.\nIn ceramic glaze applications, calcium carbonate is known as \"whiting\", and is a common ingredient for many glazes in its white powdered form. When a glaze containing this material is fired in a kiln, the whiting acts as a flux material in the glaze. Ground calcium carbonate is an abrasive (both as scouring powder and as an ingredient of household scouring creams), in particular in its calcite form, which has the relatively low hardness level of 3 on the Mohs scale, and will therefore not scratch glass and most other ceramics, enamel, bronze, iron, and steel, and have a moderate effect on softer metals like aluminium and copper. A paste made from calcium carbonate and deionized water can be used to clean tarnish on silver.\nHealth and diet.\nCalcium carbonate is widely used medicinally as an inexpensive dietary calcium supplement or gastric antacid (such as Tums and Eno). It may be used as a phosphate binder for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia (primarily in patients with chronic kidney failure). It is used in the pharmaceutical industry as an inert filler for tablets and other pharmaceuticals.\nCalcium carbonate is used in the production of calcium oxide as well as toothpaste and has seen a resurgence as a food preservative and color retainer, when used in or with products such as organic apples.\nCalcium carbonate is used therapeutically as phosphate binder in patients on maintenance haemodialysis. It is the most common form of phosphate binder prescribed, particularly in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease. Calcium carbonate is the most commonly used phosphate binder, but clinicians are increasingly prescribing the more expensive, non-calcium-based phosphate binders, particularly sevelamer.\nExcess calcium from supplements, fortified food, and high-calcium diets can cause milk-alkali syndrome, which has serious toxicity and can be fatal. In 1915, Bertram Sippy introduced the \"Sippy regimen\" of hourly ingestion of milk and cream, and the gradual addition of eggs and cooked cereal, for 10 days, combined with alkaline powders, which provided symptomatic relief for peptic ulcer disease. Over the next several decades, the Sippy regimen resulted in kidney failure, alkalosis, and hypercalcaemia, mostly in men with peptic ulcer disease. These adverse effects were reversed when the regimen stopped, but it was fatal in some patients with protracted vomiting. Milk-alkali syndrome declined in men after effective treatments for peptic ulcer disease arose. Since the 1990s it has been most frequently reported in women taking calcium supplements above the recommended range of 1.2 to 1.5\u00a0grams daily, for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, and is exacerbated by dehydration. Calcium has been added to over-the-counter products, which contributes to inadvertent excessive intake. Excessive calcium intake can lead to hypercalcemia, complications of which include vomiting, abdominal pain and altered mental status.\nAs a food additive it is designated E170, and it has an INS number of 170. Used as an acidity regulator, anticaking agent, stabilizer or color it is approved for usage in the EU, US and Australia and New Zealand. It is \"added by law to all UK milled bread flour except wholemeal\". It is used in some soy milk and almond milk products as a source of dietary calcium; at least one study suggests that calcium carbonate might be as bioavailable as the calcium in cow's milk. Calcium carbonate is also used as a firming agent in many canned and bottled vegetable products.\nSeveral calcium supplement formulations have been documented to contain the chemical element lead, posing a public health concern. Lead is commonly found in natural sources of calcium.\nAgriculture and aquaculture.\nAgricultural lime, powdered chalk or limestone, is used as a cheap method of neutralising acidic soil, making it suitable for planting, also used in aquaculture industry for pH regulation of pond soil before initiating culture. There is interest in understanding whether or not it can affect pesticide adsorption and desorption in calcareous soil.\nHousehold cleaning.\nCalcium carbonate is a key ingredient in many household cleaning powders like Comet and is used as a scrubbing agent.\nPollution mitigation.\nIn 1989, a researcher, Ken Simmons, introduced into the Whetstone Brook in Massachusetts. His hope was that the calcium carbonate would counter the acid in the stream from acid rain and save the trout that had ceased to spawn. Although his experiment was a success, it did increase the amount of aluminium ions in the area of the brook that was not treated with the limestone. This shows that can be added to neutralize the effects of acid rain in river ecosystems. Currently calcium carbonate is used to neutralize acidic conditions in both soil and water. Since the 1970s, such \"liming\" has been practiced on a large scale in Sweden to mitigate acidification and several thousand lakes and streams are limed repeatedly.\nCalcium carbonate is also used in flue-gas desulfurization applications eliminating harmful and emissions from coal and other fossil fuels burnt in large fossil fuel power stations.\nPlastics.\nCalcium carbonate is commonly used in the plastic industry as a filler. When it is incorporated in a plastic material, it can improve the hardness, stiffness, dimensional stability and processability of the material.\nCalcination equilibrium.\nCalcination of limestone using charcoal fires to produce quicklime has been practiced since antiquity by cultures all over the world. The temperature at which limestone yields calcium oxide is usually given as 825\u00a0\u00b0C, but stating an absolute threshold is misleading. Calcium carbonate exists in equilibrium with calcium oxide and carbon dioxide at any temperature. At each temperature there is a partial pressure of carbon dioxide that is in equilibrium with calcium carbonate. At room temperature the equilibrium overwhelmingly favors calcium carbonate, because the equilibrium pressure is only a tiny fraction of the partial pressure in air, which is about 0.035\u00a0kPa.\nAt temperatures above 550\u00a0\u00b0C the equilibrium pressure begins to exceed the pressure in air. So above 550\u00a0\u00b0C, calcium carbonate begins to outgas into air. However, in a charcoal fired kiln, the concentration of will be much higher than it is in air. Indeed, if all the oxygen in the kiln is consumed in the fire, then the partial pressure of in the kiln can be as high as 20\u00a0kPa.\nThe table shows that this partial pressure is not achieved until the temperature is nearly 800\u00a0\u00b0C. For the outgassing of from calcium carbonate to happen at an economically useful rate, the equilibrium pressure must significantly exceed the ambient pressure of . And for it to happen rapidly, the equilibrium pressure must exceed total atmospheric pressure of 101\u00a0kPa, which happens at 898\u00a0\u00b0C.\nSolubility.\nWith varying pressure.\nCalcium carbonate is poorly soluble in pure water (47\u00a0mg/L at normal atmospheric partial pressure as shown below).\nThe equilibrium of its solution is given by the equation (with dissolved calcium carbonate on the right):\nwhere the solubility product for is given as anywhere from \"K\"sp = to \"K\"sp = at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, depending upon the data source. What the equation means is that the product of molar concentration of calcium ions (moles of dissolved per liter of solution) with the molar concentration of dissolved cannot exceed the value of \"K\"sp. This seemingly simple solubility equation, however, must be taken along with the more complicated equilibrium of carbon dioxide with water (see carbonic acid). Some of the combines with in the solution according to\n is known as the bicarbonate ion. Calcium bicarbonate is many times more soluble in water than calcium carbonate\u2014indeed it exists \"only\" in solution.\nSome of the combines with in solution according to\nSome of the breaks up into water and dissolved carbon dioxide according to\nAnd dissolved carbon dioxide is in equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide according to\nFor ambient air, \"P\" is around atm (or equivalently 35\u00a0Pa). The last equation above fixes the concentration of dissolved as a function of \"P\", independent of the concentration of dissolved . At atmospheric partial pressure of , dissolved concentration is moles per liter. The equation before that fixes the concentration of as a function of concentration. For [] = , it results in = moles per liter. When is known, the remaining three equations together with\n\n(which is true for all aqueous solutions), and the constraint that the solution must be electrically neutral, i.e., the overall charge of dissolved positive ions must be cancelled out by the overall charge of dissolved negative ions , make it possible to solve simultaneously for the remaining five unknown concentrations (the previously mentioned form of the neutrality is valid only if calcium carbonate has been put in contact with pure water or with a neutral pH solution; in the case where the initial water solvent pH is not neutral, the balance is not neutral).\nThe adjacent table shows the result for and (in the form of pH) as a function of ambient partial pressure of (\"K\"sp = has been taken for the calculation).\nThe effect of the latter is especially evident in day-to-day life of people who have hard water. Water in aquifers underground can be exposed to levels of much higher than atmospheric. As such, water percolates through calcium carbonate rock, the dissolves according to one of the trends above. When that same water then emerges from the tap, in time, it comes into equilibrium with levels in the air by outgassing its excess . The calcium carbonate becomes less soluble as a result, and the excess precipitates as lime scale. This same process is responsible for the formation of stalactites and stalagmites in limestone caves.\nTwo hydrated phases of calcium carbonate, monohydrocalcite and ikaite , may precipitate from water at ambient conditions and persist as metastable phases.\nWith varying pH, temperature and salinity: scaling in swimming pools.\nIn contrast to the open equilibrium scenario above, many swimming pools are managed by addition of sodium bicarbonate () to the concentration of about 2\u00a0mmol/L as a buffer, then control of pH through use of HCl, , , NaOH or chlorine formulations that are acidic or basic. In this situation, dissolved inorganic carbon (total inorganic carbon) is far from equilibrium with atmospheric . Progress towards equilibrium through outgassing of is slowed by\nIn this situation, the dissociation constants for the much faster reactions\nallow the prediction of concentrations of each dissolved inorganic carbon species in solution, from the added concentration of (which constitutes more than 90% of Bjerrum plot species from pH\u00a07 to pH\u00a08 at 25\u00a0\u00b0C in fresh water). Addition of will increase concentration at any pH. Rearranging the equations given above, we can see that = , and [] = . Therefore, when concentration is known, the maximum concentration of ions before scaling through precipitation can be predicted from the formula:\n[]max = \u00d7 \nThe solubility product for (\"K\"sp) and the dissociation constants for the dissolved inorganic carbon species (including \"K\"a2) are all substantially affected by temperature and salinity, with the overall effect that []max increases from freshwater to saltwater, and decreases with rising temperature, pH, or added bicarbonate level, as illustrated in the accompanying graphs.\nThe trends are illustrative for pool management, but whether scaling occurs also depends on other factors including interactions with , and other ions in the pool, as well as supersaturation effects. Scaling is commonly observed in electrolytic chlorine generators, where there is a high pH near the cathode surface and scale deposition further increases temperature. This is one reason that some pool operators prefer borate over bicarbonate as the primary pH buffer, and avoid the use of pool chemicals containing calcium.\nSolubility in a strong or weak acid solution.\nSolutions of strong (HCl), moderately strong (sulfamic) or weak (acetic, citric, sorbic, lactic, phosphoric) acids are commercially available. They are commonly used as descaling agents to remove limescale deposits. The maximum amount of that can be \"dissolved\" by one liter of an acid solution can be calculated using the above equilibrium equations.\nwhere the initial state is the acid solution with no (not taking into account possible dissolution) and the final state is the solution with saturated . For strong acid concentrations, all species have a negligible concentration in the final state with respect to and so that the neutrality equation reduces approximately to 2[] = [] yielding [] \u2248 0.5 []. When the concentration decreases, [] becomes non-negligible so that the preceding expression is no longer valid. For vanishing acid concentrations, one can recover the final pH and the solubility of in pure water.\nFor the same total acid concentration, the initial pH of the weak acid is less acid than that of the strong acid; however, the maximum amount of which can be dissolved is approximately the same. This is because in the final state, the pH is larger than the p\"K\"a, so that the weak acid is almost completely dissociated, yielding in the end as many ions as the strong acid to \"dissolve\" the calcium carbonate.\nwhere [A] = is the total acid concentration. Thus phosphoric acid is more efficient than a monoacid since at the final almost neutral pH, the second dissociated state concentration [] is not negligible (see phosphoric acid).\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "44734", "revid": "413716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44734", "title": "Chalk", "text": "Soft carbonate rock\nChalk is a soft, white, porous, sedimentary carbonate rock. It is a form of limestone composed of the mineral calcite and originally formed under the sea by the accumulation and lithification of hard parts of organisms, mostly microscopic plankton, which had settled to the sea floor. Chalk is common throughout Western Europe, where deposits underlie parts of France, and steep cliffs are often seen where they meet the sea in places such as the Dover cliffs on the Kent coast of the English Channel.\nChalk is mined for use in industry, such as for quicklime, bricks and builder's putty, and in agriculture, for raising pH in soils with high acidity. It is also used for \"blackboard chalk\" for writing and drawing on various types of surfaces, although these can also be manufactured from other carbonate-based minerals, or gypsum.\nDescription.\nChalk is a fine-textured, earthy type of limestone distinguished by its light colour, softness, and high porosity. It is composed mostly of tiny fragments of the calcite shells or skeletons of plankton, such as foraminifera or coccolithophores. These fragments mostly take the form of calcite plates ranging from 0.5 to 4 microns in size, though about 10% to 25% of a typical chalk is composed of fragments that are 10 to 100 microns in size. The larger fragments include intact plankton skeletons and skeletal fragments of larger organisms, such as molluscs, echinoderms, or bryozoans.\nChalk is typically almost pure calcite, , with just 2% to 4% of other minerals. These are usually quartz and clay minerals, though collophane (cryptocrystalline apatite, a phosphate mineral) is also sometimes present, as nodules or as small pellets interpreted as fecal pellets. In some chalk beds, the calcite has been converted to dolomite, , and in a few cases the dolomitized chalk has been dedolomitized back to calcite.\nChalk is highly porous, with typical values of porosity ranging from 35 to 47 per cent. While it is similar in appearance to both gypsum and diatomite, chalk is identifiable by its hardness, fossil content, and its reaction to acid (it produces effervescence on contact).\nFormation.\nIn Western Europe, chalk was formed in the Late Cretaceous Epoch and the early Palaeocene Epoch (between 100 and 61 million years ago). It was deposited on extensive continental shelves at depths between , during a time of nonseasonal (likely arid) climate that reduced the amount of erosion from nearby exposed rock. The lack of nearby erosion explains the high purity of chalk. The coccolithophores, foraminifera, and other microscopic organisms from which the chalk came mostly form low-magnesium calcite skeletons, so the sediments were already in the form of highly stable low-magnesium calcite when deposited. This is in contrast with most other limestones, which formed from high-magnesium calcite or aragonite that rapidly converted to the more stable low-magnesium calcite after deposition, resulting in the early cementation of such limestones. In chalk, the absence of calcium carbonate conversion process prevented early cementation, and it accounts for chalk's high porosity. Additionally, chalk is the only form of limestone that commonly shows signs of compaction.\nFlint (a type of chert) is very common as bands parallel to the bedding or as nodules in seams, or linings to fractures, embedded in chalk. It is probably derived from sponge spicules or other siliceous organisms as water is expelled upwards during compaction. Flint is often deposited around larger fossils such as Echinoidea which may be silicified (i.e. replaced molecule by molecule by flint).\nGeology and geographic distribution.\nChalk is so common in Cretaceous marine beds that the Cretaceous Period was named for these deposits. The name Cretaceous was derived from Latin \"creta\", meaning \"chalk\". Some deposits of chalk were formed after the Cretaceous.\nThe Chalk Group is a European stratigraphic unit deposited during the late Cretaceous Period. It forms the famous White Cliffs of Dover in Kent, England, as well as their counterparts of the Cap Blanc Nez on the other side of the Dover Strait. The Champagne region of France is mostly underlain by chalk deposits, which contain artificial caves used for wine storage. Some of the highest chalk cliffs in the world occur at Jasmund National Park in Germany and at M\u00f8ns Klint in Denmark.\nChalk deposits are also found in Cretaceous beds on other continents, such as the Austin Chalk, Selma Group, and Niobrara Formations of the North American interior. Chalk is also found in western Egypt (Khoman Formation) and western Australia (Miria Formation).\nChalk of Oligocene to Neogene age has been found in drill cores of rock under the Pacific Ocean at Stewart Arch in the Solomon Islands.\nThere are layers of chalk, containing \"Globorotalia\", in the Nicosia Formation of Cyprus, which formed during the Pliocene.\nMining.\nChalk is mined from chalk deposits both above ground and underground. Chalk mining boomed during the Industrial Revolution, due to the need for chalk products such as quicklime and bricks.\nUses.\nMost people first encounter chalk in school where it refers to blackboard chalk, which was originally made of mineral chalk, since it easily crumbles and leaves particles that stick loosely to rough surfaces, allowing it to make writing that can be readily erased. Blackboard chalk manufacturers now may use mineral chalk, other mineral sources of calcium carbonate, or the mineral gypsum (calcium sulfate). While gypsum-based blackboard chalk is the lowest cost to produce, and thus widely used in the developing world, use of carbonate-based chalk produces larger particles and thus less dust, and it is marketed as \"dustless chalk\".\nColoured chalks, pastel chalks, and sidewalk chalk (shaped into larger sticks and often coloured), used to draw on sidewalks, streets, and driveways, are primarily made of gypsum rather than calcium carbonate chalk.\nMagnesium carbonate chalk is commonly used as a drying agent to obtain better grip by gymnasts and rock climbers.\nGlazing putty mainly contains chalk as a filler in linseed oil.\nChalk and other forms of limestone may be used for their properties as a base. Chalk is a source of quicklime by thermal decomposition, or slaked lime following quenching of quicklime with water. In agriculture, chalk is used for raising pH in soils with high acidity. Small doses of chalk can also be used as an antacid. Additionally, the small particles of chalk make it a substance ideal for cleaning and polishing. For example, toothpaste commonly contains small amounts of chalk, which serves as a mild abrasive. Polishing chalk is chalk prepared with a carefully controlled grain size, for very fine polishing of metals.\nFrench chalk (also known as tailor's chalk) is traditionally a hard chalk used to make temporary markings on cloth, mainly by tailors. It is now usually made of talc (magnesium silicate).\nChalk beds form important petroleum reservoirs in the North Sea and along the Gulf Coast of North America.\nPrevious uses.\nIn southeast England, deneholes are a notable example of ancient chalk pits. Such bell pits may also mark the sites of ancient flint mines, where the prime object was to remove flint nodules for stone tool manufacture. The surface remains at Cissbury are one such example, but perhaps the most famous is the extensive complex at Grimes Graves in Norfolk.\nChalk was traditionally used in recreation. In field sports, such as tennis played on grass, powdered chalk was used to mark the boundary lines of the playing field or court. If a ball hits the line, a cloud of chalk or pigment dust will be visible. In recent years, powdered chalk has been replaced with titanium dioxide. In gymnastics, rock-climbing, weightlifting and tug of war, chalk \u2014 now usually magnesium carbonate \u2014 is applied to the hands and feet to remove perspiration and reduce slipping.\nChalk may also be used as a house construction material instead of brick or wattle and daub: quarried chalk was cut into blocks and used as ashlar, or loose chalk was rammed into blocks and laid in mortar. There are still houses standing which have been constructed using chalk as the main building material. Most are pre-Victorian though a few are more recent.\nA mixture of chalk and mercury can be used as fingerprint powder. However, because of the toxicity of the mercury, the use of such mixtures for fingerprinting was abandoned in 1967.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Tate's last completed film, \"12+1\", was released posthumously in 1969.\nOn August 9, 1969, Tate and four others were murdered by members of the Manson Family, a cult, in the home she shared with Polanski, while he was away. She was eight-and-a-half months pregnant.\nBiography.\n1943\u20131964: Childhood and early acting career.\nSharon Marie Tate was born on January 24, 1943, in Dallas, Texas, the eldest of three daughters to Colonel Paul James Tate, a United States Army intelligence officer, and his wife, Doris Gwendolyn (n\u00e9e Willett). At six months of age, Tate won the \"Miss Tiny Tot of Dallas Pageant\", but her parents had no show business ambitions for their daughter. Paul Tate was promoted and transferred several times. By the age of 16, Tate had lived in six cities and reportedly found it difficult to maintain friendships. Her family described her as shy and lacking in self-confidence. As an adult, Tate commented that people would misinterpret her shyness as aloofness until they knew her better.\nTate attended South Shaver Elementary in Pasadena, Texas through 1955, Chief Joseph Junior High School (now middle school) from September 1955 to June 1958, and Columbia High School in Richland, Washington, from September 1958 to October 1959. In\u00a0El\u00a0Paso, Texas, she attended Irvin High School from late fall 1959 to April 1960 and then Vicenza American High School in Vicenza, Italy, from April 1960 to graduation in June 1961.\nAs she matured, people commented on Tate's appearance; she began entering beauty pageants, winning the title of \"Miss Richland\" in Washington in 1959 at age sixteen. She spoke of her ambition to study psychiatry and her intention to compete in the \"Miss Washington\" pageant in 1960; however, before she could do either, her father was transferred to Italy. With her family relocating to Verona, Tate learned that she had become a local celebrity owing to the publication of a photograph of her in a swimsuit on the cover of the military newspaper \"Stars and Stripes\". She discovered a kinship with other students at the American school she attended in nearby Vicenza, recognizing that their backgrounds and feelings of separation were similar to her own, and, for the first time in her life, began to form lasting friendships.\nTate and her friends became interested in the filming of \"Hemingway's Adventures of a Young Man,\" which was being made nearby with Paul Newman, Susan Strasberg and Richard Beymer, and obtained parts as film extras. Beymer noticed Tate in the crowd and introduced himself, and the two dated during the production of the film, with Beymer encouraging Tate to pursue a film career. In 1960, Tate was employed by the singer Pat Boone and appeared with him in an episode of the television series \"The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom\" which was filmed in Venice.\nLater that year, when \"Barabbas\" was being filmed near Verona, Tate was once again hired as an extra. Actor Jack Palance was impressed by her appearance and attitude, although her role was too small to judge her talent. He arranged a screen test for her in Rome, but this did not lead to further work. Tate returned to the United States alone, saying that she wanted to further her studies, but tried to find film work. After a few months, Doris Tate, who feared for her daughter's safety, suffered a nervous breakdown and her daughter was persuaded to return to Italy.\nThe family returned to the United States in 1962 and Tate moved to Los Angeles, where she contacted Richard Beymer's agent, Harold Gefsky. After their first meeting, Gefsky agreed to represent her, and secured work for her in television and magazine advertisements. In 1963, he introduced her to Martin Ransohoff, director of Filmways, Inc., who signed her to a seven-year contract. She was considered for the role of Billie Jo Bradley on CBS's sitcom \"Petticoat Junction,\" but Ransohoff believed that she lacked confidence and the role was given to Jeannine Riley. Ransohoff gave Tate small parts in \"Mister Ed\" and \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" to help her gain experience, but was unwilling to allow her to play a more substantial role. \"Mr. Ransohoff didn't want the audience to see me till I was ready\", Tate was quoted in a 1967 article in \"Playboy\".\nDuring this time, Tate met the French actor Philippe Forquet and began a relationship with him in 1963. They became engaged, but their relationship was volatile and they frequently argued. Career pressures drove them apart and they broke up the next year in 1964.\nIn 1964, she met Jay Sebring, a former sailor who had established himself as a leading hair stylist in Hollywood. Tate later said that Sebring's nature was especially gentle but, when he proposed marriage, she declined. She said that she would retire from acting as soon as she married and, at that time, she intended to focus on her career.\n1964\u20131967: Hollywood recognition and \"Valley of the Dolls\".\nIn 1964, Tate made a screen test for Sam Peckinpah opposite Steve McQueen for the film \"The Cincinnati Kid\". Ransohoff and Peckinpah agreed that Tate's timidity and lack of experience would cause her to flounder in such a large part, and she was rejected in favor of Tuesday Weld. She continued to gain experience with minor television appearances and, after she auditioned unsuccessfully for the role of Liesl in the film version of \"The Sound of Music\", Ransohoff gave Tate walk-on roles in two motion pictures in which he was the producer: \"The Americanization of Emily\" and \"The Sandpiper\". In late 1965, Ransohoff finally gave Tate her first major role in a motion picture in the film \"Eye of the Devil\", costarring David Niven, Deborah Kerr, Donald Pleasence and David Hemmings.\nTate and Sebring traveled to London to prepare for filming, where she met the Alexandrian Wiccan High Priest and High Priestess Alex and Maxine Sanders. Meanwhile, as part of Ransohoff's promotion of Tate, he arranged the production of a short documentary called \"All Eyes on Sharon Tate\", to be released at the same time as \"Eye of the Devil\". It included an interview with \"Eye of the Devil\" director J. Lee Thompson, who expressed his initial doubts about Tate's potential with the comment, \"We even agreed that if after the first two weeks Sharon was not quite making it, we would put her back in cold storage\", but added that he soon realized Tate was \"tremendously exciting\".\nTate played Odile, a witch who exerts a mysterious power over a landowner, played by Niven, and his wife, played by Kerr. Although she did not have as many lines as the other actors, Tate's performance was considered crucial to the film, and she was required, more than the other cast members, to set an ethereal tone. Niven described her as a \"great discovery\", and Kerr said that, with \"a reasonable amount of luck\", Tate would be a great success. In interviews, Tate commented on her good fortune in working with such professionals in her first film and said that she had learned a lot about acting simply by watching Kerr at work. Much of the filming took place in France, and Sebring returned to Los Angeles to fulfill his business obligations. After filming, Tate remained in London, where she immersed herself in the fashion world and nightclubs. Around this time, she met Roman Polanski.\nTate and Polanski later agreed that neither of them had been impressed by the other when they first met. Polanski was planning \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\", which was being coproduced by Ransohoff, and had decided that he wanted the red-headed actress Jill St. John for the female lead. Ransohoff insisted that Polanski cast Tate and, after meeting with her, Polanski agreed that she would be suitable on the condition that she wore a red wig during filming. The company traveled to Italy for filming, where Tate's fluent Italian proved useful in communicating with the local crew members. A perfectionist, Polanski had little patience with the inexperienced Tate and said in an interview that one scene had required 70 takes before he was satisfied. In addition to directing, Polanski also played one of the main characters, a guileless young man who is intrigued by Tate's character and begins a romance with her. As filming progressed, Polanski praised her performances and her confidence grew. They began a relationship and Tate moved into Polanski's London apartment after filming ended. Jay Sebring traveled to London, where he insisted on meeting Polanski. Although friends later said he was devastated, he befriended Polanski and remained Tate's closest confidant. Polanski later commented that Sebring was a lonely and isolated person, who viewed Tate and himself as his family.\nTate returned to the United States to film \"Don't Make Waves\" with Tony Curtis, leaving Polanski in London. Tate played the role of Malibu and the film was intended to capitalize on the popularity of beach movies at the time, as well as the music of such artists as the Beach Boys and Jan and Dean. Tate's character, billed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer publicity as \"Malibu, Queen of the Surf\", wore little more than a bikini for most of the film. Disappointed with the film, she began sarcastically referring to herself as \"sexy little me\". Before the film's release, Tate featured in a major publishing campaign for Coppertone sunscreen. The film opened to poor reviews and mediocre ticket sales, and Tate was quoted as confiding to a reporter, \"It's a terrible movie\", before adding, \"Sometimes I say things I shouldn't. I guess I'm too outspoken.\"\nPolanski returned to the United States and was contracted by the head of Paramount Pictures, Robert Evans, to direct and write the screenplay for \"Rosemary's Baby\", which was based on Ira Levin's novel of the same name. Polanski later admitted that he had wanted Tate to star in the film and had hoped that someone would suggest her, as he felt it inappropriate to make the suggestion himself. The producers did not suggest Tate, and Mia Farrow was cast. A frequent visitor to the set, Tate was photographed there by \"Esquire\" and the resulting photographs generated considerable publicity for both Tate and the film. A March 1967 article about Tate in \"Playboy\" began, \"This is the year that Sharon Tate happens\u00a0...\" and included six nude or partially nude photographs taken by Roman Polanski during filming of \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\". Tate was optimistic: \"Eye of the Devil\" and \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\" were each due for release.\nShe had been cast to play a major role in the screenplay of \"Valley of the Dolls\". One of the bestselling novels in modern history, the film version was highly publicized and anticipated. While Tate acknowledged that such a prominent role should further her career, she confided to Polanski how she did not like either the book or the script. Patty Duke, Barbara Parkins and Judy Garland were cast as the other leads. Susan Hayward replaced Garland after the latter's substance abuse became a problem during early filming. Director Mark Robson was highly critical of the three principal actresses but, according to Duke, directed most of his criticism at Tate. Duke later said that Robson \"continually treated [Tate] like an imbecile, which she definitely was not, and she was very attuned and sensitive to this treatment\". Polanski later quoted Robson as saying to him, \"That's a great girl you're living with. Few actresses have her kind of vulnerability. She's got a great future.\"\nIn interviews during production, Tate expressed an affinity for her character, Jennifer North, an aspiring actress admired only for her body. Some magazines commented that Tate was viewed similarly and \"Look\" published an unfavorable article about the three lead actresses, describing Tate as \"a hopelessly stupid and vain starlet\". Tate, Duke and Parkins developed a close friendship that continued after the completion of the film. During the shooting of \"Valley of the Dolls\", Tate confided to Parkins that she was \"madly in love\" with Polanski. \"Yes, there's no doubt that Roman is the man in my life\", Tate was quoted as saying in the New York \"Sunday News\". Tate promoted the film enthusiastically. She frequently commented on her admiration for Lee Grant, with whom she had played several dramatic scenes. Tate was quoted as saying, \"I learned a great deal about acting in [\"Valley of the Dolls\"], particularly in my scenes with Lee Grant... She knows what acting is all about and everything she does, from little mannerisms to delivering her lines, is pure professionalism.\"\nA journalist asked Tate to comment on her nude scene, and she replied,\nI have no qualms about it at all. I don't see any difference between being stark naked or fully dressed\u00a0\u2014 if it's part of the job and it's done with meaning and intention. I honestly don't understand the big fuss made over nudity and sex in films. It's silly. On TV, the children can watch people murdering each other, which is a very unnatural thing, but they can't watch two people in the very natural process of making love. Now, really, that doesn't make any sense, does it?\nAn edited version of \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\" was released, and Polanski expressed disgust at Ransohoff for \"butchering\" his film. \"Newsweek\" called it \"a witless travesty\", and it was not profitable. Tate's performance was largely ignored in reviews and, when she was mentioned, it was usually in relation to her nude scenes. \"Eye of the Devil\" was released shortly after, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer attempted to build interest in Tate with its press release describing her as \"one of the screen's most exciting new personalities\". The film failed to find an audience and most reviews were indifferent, neither praising nor condemning it. \"The New York Times\" wrote that one of the few highlights was Tate's \"chillingly beautiful but expressionless performance\".\nThe \"All Eyes on Sharon Tate\" documentary was used to publicize the film. Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming \"Eye of the Devil\", dancing in nightclubs, and sightseeing around London, and also contained a brief interview with her. Asked about her acting ambitions, she replied, \"I don't fool myself. I can't see myself doing Shakespeare.\" She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy and, in other interviews, she expressed her desire to become \"a light comedienne in the Carole Lombard style\". She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by: Faye Dunaway and Catherine Deneuve. Of the latter, she said, \"I'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve. She plays beautiful, sensitive, deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them.\"\nLater in the year, \"Valley of the Dolls\" opened to almost uniformly negative reviews. Bosley Crowther wrote in \"The New York Times\", \"all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away\". \"Newsweek\" said that the film \"has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure\", but a later article read: \"Astoundingly photogenic, infinitely curvaceous, Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time.\" The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications, including \"The Saturday Review\", which wrote, \"Ten years ago\u00a0... Parkins, Duke, and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens; they are totally lacking in style, authority, or charm.\" \"The Hollywood Reporter\" provided some positive comments, such as, \"Sharon Tate emerges as the film's most sympathetic character\u00a0... William H. Daniels' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" praised Tate as \"a wonder to behold\" but, after describing the dialogue in one scene as \"the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization\", concluded that, \"I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a sex symbol than Raquel Welch.\"\n1968\u20131969: Marriage to Roman Polanski and final films.\nIn late 1967, Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles. She was depicted as being untraditional and modern, and was quoted as saying that couples should live together before marrying. They were married in Chelsea, London, on January 20, 1968 (four days before Tate's 25th birthday), with considerable publicity. Polanski was dressed in \"Edwardian finery\" while Tate was attired in an off-white taffeta minidress. The couple moved into Polanski's mews house off Eaton Square in Belgravia, London.\nPhotographer Peter Evans described them as \"the imperfect couple. They were the Douglas Fairbanks/Mary Pickford of our time\u2026. Cool, nomadic, talented, and nicely shocking.\" Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage but Polanski remained promiscuous and described her attitude to his infidelity as \"Sharon's big hang-up\". He reminded her that she had promised not to change him. Tate accepted his conditions, though she confided to friends that she hoped that he would change. Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying, \"We have a good arrangement. Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him.\"\nPolanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff, and she began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her that he wanted to be married to \"a hippie, not a housewife\". The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry, including Warren Beatty, Jacqueline Bisset, Leslie Caron, Joan Collins, Mia Farrow, Jane Fonda, Peter Fonda, Laurence Harvey, Steve McQueen, Joanna Pettet and Peter Sellers; older film stars such as Yul Brynner, Kirk Douglas, Henry Fonda and Danny Kaye; musicians such as Jim Morrison and the Mamas &amp; the Papas; and record producer Terry Melcher and his girlfriend Candice Bergen. Jay Sebring remained one of the couple's more frequent companions. Polanski's friends included Wojciech Frykowski, whom Polanski had known since his youth in Poland, and Frykowski's girlfriend Abigail Folger, the coffee heiress. Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles for a few months until they arranged to lease Patty Duke's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968. The Polanski house was often full of strangers, and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the \"free spirit\" of the times, saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was \"live and let live\". Her close friend Leslie Caron commented that the Polanskis were too trusting, \"to the point of recklessness\", and that she had been alarmed by it.\nIn the summer of 1968, Tate began work on \"The Wrecking Crew\", a comedy in which she played Freya Carlson, an accident-prone spy who was also a romantic interest for star Dean Martin, playing Matt Helm. She performed her own stunts and was taught martial arts by Bruce Lee. The film was successful and brought Tate strong reviews, with many reviewers praising her comedic performance. \"The New York Times\" critic Vincent Canby criticized the film but wrote, \"The only nice thing is Sharon Tate, a tall, really great-looking girl.\" Martin commented that he intended to make another \"Matt Helm\" film and that he wanted Tate to reprise her role.\nAround this time, Tate was feted as a promising newcomer. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actress for her performance in \"Valley of the Dolls.\" She was also runner-up to Lynn Redgrave in the \"Motion Picture Herald\"'s poll for \"The Star of Tomorrow\", in which box-office drawing power was the main criterion. These results indicated that her career was beginning to accelerate, and she negotiated a fee of $150,000 for her next film.\nShe became pregnant near the end of 1968, and she and Polanski moved to 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles on February 15, 1969. The house had previously been occupied by their friends Terry Melcher and Candice Bergen. Tate and Polanski had visited it several times, and Tate was thrilled to learn that it was available, referring to it as her \"love house\". At their new home, the Polanskis continued to be popular hosts for their large group of friends, although some of them still worried about the strange people who continued to show up at their parties. Tate was encouraged by the positive reviews of her comedic performances and chose the comedy \"The Thirteen Chairs\" (1969) as her next project, largely for the opportunity to co-star with Orson Welles. In March 1969, she traveled to Italy to begin filming, and Polanski went to London to work on \"The Day of the Dolphin\".\nFrykowski and Folger moved into the Cielo Drive house. After completing \"The Thirteen Chairs\", Tate joined Polanski in London. She posed in their apartment for photographer Terry O'Neill in casual domestic scenes such as opening baby gifts, and she completed a series of glamor photographs for the British magazine \"Queen\". She returned from London to Los Angeles on July 20, 1969, on the \"Queen Elizabeth 2\" (by this ship from Southampton, England to New York). Polanski was due to return on August 12 in time for the birth, and he had asked Frykowski and Folger to stay in the house with Tate until his return.\nMurder, funeral and trial.\nOn August 8, 1969, Tate entertained actress Joanna Pettet for lunch at her home, confiding in her disappointment at Polanski's delay in returning from London. Polanski telephoned her that day. Her younger sister Debra also called, to ask if she, her boyfriend and another friend could pick up a saddle that Sharon had bought for Debra in Europe. Tate declined, offering to have them over another time. Later that evening, she reportedly dined at El Coyote Cafe with Jay Sebring, Wojciech Frykowski, and Abigail Folger, returning at about 10:30\u00a0p.m.\nShortly after midnight, Sebring, Frykowski, Folger, and Tate and her unborn son were murdered by members of the Manson Family cult. Tate was the last of the victims to die, despite her pleas that the Family take her with them so that she could give birth. Their bodies were discovered the following morning by Tate's housekeeper Winifred Chapman. Police arrived at the scene to find a young man shot dead in his car in the driveway, later identified as Steven Parent. Inside the house, the bodies of Tate and Sebring were found with a long rope which had been thrown over a beam and then tied around each of their necks, connecting them. On the front lawn lay the bodies of Frykowski and Folger. All of the victims except Parent had been stabbed numerous times. The coroner's report for Tate noted that she had been stabbed 16 times and that \"five of the wounds were in and of themselves fatal\". In addition, the coroner's inquest found that Tate was still alive when she was hanged with the rope, but she died immediately from a \"massive hemorrhage\".\nPolice took the only survivor at the address \u2013 the property's caretaker William Garretson \u2013 in for questioning. Garretson lived in the guest house that was located on the property a short distance from the house. He was questioned and submitted to a polygraph test and stated that Parent had visited him at approximately 11:30\u00a0p.m. and left shortly after. He told police that he had no involvement in the murders and did not know anything that could help the investigation, and he was subsequently released.\nPolanski was informed of the murders and returned to Los Angeles where police questioned him about his wife and her friends. On Wednesday, August 13, Tate was interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City, California, together with her unborn son, who was posthumously named Paul Richard Polanski. Sebring's funeral took place later the same day; the funerals were scheduled several hours apart to allow friends of Tate and Sebring to attend both.\n\"Life\" devoted a lengthy article to the murders and featured photographs of the crime scenes. Polanski was interviewed for the article and allowed himself to be photographed at the entrance of the house, next to the front door with the word \"PIG\" still visible, written in Tate's blood. He was widely criticized for the photoshoot but he argued that he wanted to know who was responsible and was willing to shock the magazine's readers in the hope that someone would come forward with information.\nCuriosity about the victims led to the re-release of Tate's films, which achieved greater popularity than they had in their initial runs. Some newspapers began to speculate about the motives for the murders. Some published photographs of Tate were alleged to be taken at a Satanic ritual, but were in fact production photographs from \"Eye of the Devil\". Friends spoke out against the portrayal of Tate by some elements of the media. Mia Farrow said that she was as \"sweet and pure a human being as I have ever known\", while Patty Duke remembered her as \"a gentle, gentle creature\". Polanski tearfully berated a crowd of journalists at a news conference, asking them, \"Did you ever write how good she was?\". Polanski said he began to suspect various friends and associates, and his paranoia subsided only when the killers were arrested. Newspapers claimed that many Hollywood stars were moving out of the city, while others installed security systems in their homes. Dominick Dunne recalled the tension:\nThe shock waves that went through the town were beyond anything I had ever seen before. People were convinced that the rich and famous of the community were in peril. Children were sent out of town. Guards were hired. Steve McQueen packed a gun when he went to Jay Sebring's funeral.\nIn September 1969, members of the Manson \"Family\" were arrested on unrelated charges, eventually leading authorities to a breakthrough on the Tate case, as well. They explained that the motive for the murders was not the identity of the victims, but rather the house at that address, which had previously been rented to record producer Terry Melcher, an acquaintance of Manson. In 1994, the house was demolished and a new house was constructed on the site.\nLegacy.\nIn the early 1980s, Stephen Kay, who had worked for the prosecution in the trial, became alarmed that Manson Family member Leslie Van Houten had gathered 900 signatures on a petition for her parole. He contacted Tate's mother, Doris, who said that she was sure she could do better, and the two mounted a publicity campaign, collecting over 350,000 signatures supporting the denial of parole. Although Van Houten had been seen as the most likely of the killers to be paroled, her petition was denied after the efforts of Kay and Tate. Doris Tate became a vocal advocate for victims' rights and, in discussing her daughter's murder and meeting other crime victims, assumed the role of counselor, using her profile to encourage public discussion and criticism of the corrections system.\nFor the rest of her life she strongly campaigned against the parole of each of the Manson killers and worked closely with other victims of violent crime. Several times she confronted Charles \"Tex\" Watson and Susan Atkins at parole hearings, explaining, \"I feel that Sharon has to be represented in that hearing room. If they're [the killers] pleading for their lives then I have to be there representing her.\" She addressed Tex Watson directly during her victim impact statement in 1990: \"What mercy, sir, did you show my daughter when she was begging for her life? What mercy did you show my daughter when she said, 'Give me two weeks to have my baby and then you can kill me'? ... When will Sharon come up for parole? Will these seven victims and possibly more walk out of their graves if you get paroled? You cannot be trusted.\"\nIn 1992 President George Bush recognized Doris Tate as one of his \"thousand points of light\" for her volunteer work on behalf of victims' rights. By this time Doris Tate had been diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor and her health and strength were failing; her meeting with Bush marked her final public appearance. When she died later that year her youngest daughter, Patricia Gay Tate, known as Patti, continued her work. She contributed to the 1993 foundation of the Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau, a nonprofit organization that aims to influence crime legislation throughout the United States and to give greater rights and protection to victims of violent crime. In 1995, the Doris Tate Crime Victims Foundation was founded as a nonprofit organization to promote public awareness of the judicial system and to provide support to the victims of violent crime.\nPatti Tate confronted David Geffen and board members of Geffen Records in 1993 over plans to include a song written by Charles Manson on the Guns N' Roses album \"The Spaghetti Incident?\" She commented to a journalist that the record company was \"putting Manson up on a pedestal for young people who don't know who he is to worship like an idol\".\nAfter Patti's death from breast cancer in 2000 her older sister Debra continued to represent the Tate family at parole hearings. Debra Tate said of the killers: \"They don't show any personal responsibility. They haven't made atonement to any one of my family members.\" She has also unsuccessfully lobbied for her sister to be awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nColonel Paul Tate preferred not to make public comments; however he was a constant presence during the murder trial and in the following years attended parole hearings with his wife and wrote letters to authorities in which he strongly opposed any suggestion of parole. He died in May 2005.\nRoman Polanski gave away all of his possessions after the murders, unable to bear any reminders of the period that he called \"the happiest I ever was in my life\". He remained in Los Angeles until the killers were arrested. His 1979 film \"Tess\" was dedicated \"to Sharon\", as Tate had read Thomas Hardy's \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\" during her final stay with Polanski in London and had left it for him to read with the comment that it would be a good story for them to film together. He tried to explain his anguish after the murder of his wife and unborn son in his 1984 autobiography \"Roman by Polanski\", saying, \"Since Sharon's death, and despite appearances to the contrary, my enjoyment of life has been incomplete. In moments of unbearable personal tragedy some people find solace in religion. In my case the opposite happened. Any religious faith I had was shattered by Sharon's murder. It reinforced my faith in the absurd.\"\nIn July 2005, Polanski successfully sued \"Vanity Fair\" magazine for libel after it alleged that he had tried to seduce a woman on his way to Tate's funeral. Among the witnesses who testified on his behalf were Debra Tate and Mia Farrow. Describing Polanski immediately after Tate's death, Farrow testified, \"Of this I can be sure \u2014 of his frame of mind when we were there, of what we talked about, of his utter sense of loss, of despair and bewilderment and shock and love \u2014 a love that he had lost.\" At the conclusion of the case, Polanski read a statement, saying in part, \"The memory of my late wife Sharon Tate was at the forefront of my mind in bringing this action.\"\nThe murders committed by the Manson \"Family\" have been described by social commentators as one of the defining moments of the 1960s. Joan Didion wrote, \"Many people I know in Los Angeles believe that the Sixties ended abruptly on August 9, 1969, ended at the exact moment when word of the murders on Cielo Drive traveled like brushfire through the community, and in a sense this is true. The tension broke that day. The paranoia was fulfilled.\"\nTate's work as an actress has been reassessed since her death, with contemporary film writers and critics, such as Leonard Maltin, describing her potential as a comedian. A restored version of \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\" more closely resembles Polanski's intention. Maltin lauded the film as \"near-brilliant\" and Tate's work in \"Don't Make Waves\" and \"The Wrecking Crew\" as her two best performances, as well as the best indicators of the career she might have established. \"Eye of the Devil\" with its supernatural themes, and \"Valley of the Dolls\", with its overstated melodrama, have each achieved a degree of cult status.\nTate's biographer, Greg King, holds a view often expressed by members of the Tate family, writing in \"Sharon Tate and the Manson Murders\" (2000): \"Sharon's real legacy lies not in her movies or in her television work. The very fact that, today, victims or their families in California are able to sit before those convicted of a crime and have a voice in the sentencing at trials or at parole hearings, is largely due to the work of Doris [and Patti] Tate. Their years of devotion to Sharon's memory and dedication to victims' rights\u00a0... have helped transform Sharon from mere victim, [and] restore a human face to one of the twentieth century's most infamous crimes.\"\nIn 2012, the book \"Restless Souls\" was published. Authored by Alisa Statman, a close friend of Patti Tate, two short chapters in the book are written by Sharon's niece, Brie Taylor Ford, daughter of the late Patti Tate Ford. The book contains portions of the unfinished autobiographies of Sharon's father, mother and sister Patti, along with Statman's own \"personal interpretation[s]\". Debra Tate has questioned the book's veracity.\nA coffee table book by Debra Tate, called \"Sharon Tate: Recollection\", was released on June 10, 2014. It is the first book about Tate that is devoted exclusively to her life and career without covering her death, its aftermath, or the events that led to it.\nIn 2019, \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\", a Quentin Tarantino film, was released, partly portraying the life of Sharon Tate, played by Margot Robbie. The film provides a reimagining of the events leading to Tate's death by the Mansons, which is prevented in the film due to the actions of other characters in the story.\nCharacter and public image.\nTate had a habit of nail biting and going barefoot in public. When she went to restaurants with a \"No Shoes, No Service\" rule, she would frequently put rubber bands around her ankles to pretend that she was wearing sandals. Both these traits were featured in \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\".\nTate had an interest in martial arts, and was a close friend and a student of Bruce Lee, who taught her Kung fu. Lee also helped her do martial-arts training for the American spy comedy film, \"The Wrecking Crew\", in 1968.\nIn popular culture.\nIn 2009, American contemporary artist Jeremy Corbell presented a comprehensive mixed media art exhibition titled \"ICON: Life Love &amp; Style of Sharon Tate\" in honor of the 40th anniversary of Tate's death. With the blessing of the Tate family, Corbell created a 350-piece historic art exhibition celebrating Tate's style and life. The art and fashion-based presentation showcased images of Tate's never-before-revealed wardrobe by designers such as Christian Dior, Thea Porter, Ossie Clark and Yves Saint Laurent.\nTate has also been portrayed by multiple actresses in the decades since her death, mostly in projects that either reference, or are explicitly about, the Manson Family and the murders of 1969. Among the actresses who have played her are:\nIn music, Tate has been mentioned in the opening lines of \"It's Too Late\" by the Jim Carroll Band from their album \"Catholic Boy\" (1980) and the song \"Leaving It Up to You\" by artist John Cale from his album \"Helen of Troy\" (1975). She is also referenced by name in the poem \"In the Hills of Benedict Canyon\" by musician Lana Del Rey from her poetry collection \"Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass\" (2020).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n | last = Gilmore\n | first = John\n | author-link = John Gilmore (writer)\n | title = The Garbage People\n | year = 1971\n | publisher = Omega Press\n | lccn = 70168482\n | last = Gilmore\n | first = John\n | author-link = John Gilmore (writer)\n | title = Manson: The Unholy Trail of Charlie &amp; the Family\n | year = 2000\n | publisher = Amok Books\n | isbn = 1-878923-13-7\n | last = King\n | first = Greg\n | title = Sharon Tate and the Manson Murders\n | year = 2000\n | publisher = Barricade Books\n | isbn = 1-56980-157-6\n | url = https://archive.org/details/sharontatemanso00king\n | last = Polanski\n | first = Roman\n | author-link = Roman Polanski\n | title = Roman by Polanski\n | year = 1984\n | publisher = Eurexpart B.V.\n | isbn = 0-688-02621-4\n | url = https://archive.org/details/roman00pola"}

It is connected to the Adriatic Sea to the north, and is bounded by Southern Italy, including Basilicata, Calabria, Sicily, and the Salento peninsula to the west, southern Albania (and western Apulia, Italy) to the north, and the west coast of Greece, including the Peloponnese.\nAll major islands in the sea, which are located in the east of the sea, belong to Greece. They are collectively named the Ionian Islands, the main ones being Corfu, Kefalonia, Zakynthos, Lefkada, and Ithaca.\nThere are ferry routes between Patras and Igoumenitsa, Greece, and Brindisi and Ancona, Italy, that cross the east and north of the Ionian Sea, and from Piraeus westward. Calypso Deep, the deepest point in the Mediterranean at , is in the Ionian Sea, at . The sea is one of the most seismically active areas in the world.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Ionian\" comes from the Greek word . Its etymology is unknown. Ancient Greek writers, especially Aeschylus, linked it to the myth of Io. In ancient Greek the adjective \"Ionios\" () was used as an epithet for the sea because Io swam across it. According to the \"Oxford Classical Dictionary\", the name may derive from Ionians who sailed to the West, however the word for Ionians is spelled with an omega ( \u1f3c\u03c9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2) rather than an omicron as in the word for the Ionian Sea. There were also narratives about other eponymic legendary figures; according to one version, \"Ionius\" was a son of \"Adrias\" (eponymic for the Adriatic Sea); according to another, \"Ionius\" was a son of \"Dyrrhachus\". When Dyrrhachus was attacked by his own brothers, Heracles, who was passing through the area, came to his aid, but in the fight the hero killed his ally's son by mistake. The body was cast into the water, and thereafter was called the Ionian Sea.\nGeography.\nExtent.\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Ionian Sea as follows:\n\"On the North.\" A line running from the mouth of the Butrinto River (39\u00b044'N) in Albania, to Cape Karagol in Corfu (39\u00b045'N), along the North Coast of Corfu to Cape Kephali (39\u00b045'N) and from thence to Cape Santa Maria di Leuca in Italy.\n\"On the East.\" From the mouth of the Butrinto River in Albania down the coast of the mainland to Cape Matapan.\n\"On the South.\" A line from Cape Matapan to Cape Passero, the Southern point of Sicily.\n\"On the West.\" The East coast of Sicily and the Southeast coast of Italy to Cape Santa Maria di Leuca.\nPlaces.\nFrom south to north in the west, then north to south in the east:\nHistory.\nThe sea is famous for the seafaring adventures of the Ancient Greek hero Odysseus, the warrior-king of the island of Ithaca.\nThe Ionian Sea was regularly crossed since at least the 8th century BC, by ancient Greek colonizers who were establishing colonies in Italy.\nDuring the Roman period, it was the location of the Battle of Actium between Octavian and Mark Antony in 31 BC.\nA number of major naval engagements would be fought over the eastern section of the sea and its islands throughout the modern era, culminating in its control by the modern state of Greece. The western section of the Ionian sea was always controlled since the Middle Ages by the kingdom of the Two Sicilies and since 1861 by the Kingdom of Italy.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "44737", "revid": "6058423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44737", "title": "Bulgars", "text": "Turkic tribal confederation\nThe Bulgars (also Bulghars, Bulgari, Bolgars, Bolghars, Bolgari, Proto-Bulgarians) were Turkic semi-nomadic warrior tribes that flourished in the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe and the Volga region between the 5th and 7th centuries. They became known as nomadic equestrians in the Volga-Ural region, but some researchers trace Bulgar ethnic roots to Central Asia.\nDuring their westward migration across the Eurasian Steppe, the Bulgar tribes absorbed other tribal groups and cultural influences in a process of ethnogenesis, including Iranic, Uralic, and Hunnic tribes. The Bulgars spoke a Turkic language, the Bulgar language of the Oghuric branch. They preserved the military titles, organization, and customs of Eurasian steppes as well as pagan shamanism and belief in the sky deity Tangra.\nThe Bulgars became semi-sedentary during the 7th century in the Pontic-Caspian steppe, establishing the polity of Old Great Bulgaria c.\u00a0630\u2013635, which was defeated by the Khazar Khaganate in 668 AD. In 681, Khan Asparukh conquered Scythia Minor, opening access to Moesia, and established the Danubian Bulgaria \u2013 the First Bulgarian Empire, where the Bulgars became a political and military elite. They merged subsequently with established Byzantine populations, as well as with previously settled Slavic tribes, and were eventually Slavicized, thus becoming one of the ancestors of modern Bulgarians.\nMost of the remaining Pontic Bulgars migrated in the 7th century to the Volga River, where they assimilated the people of the Imenkovo culture and founded Volga Bulgaria; they preserved their identity well into the 13th century. The modern Volga Tatars, Bashkirs and Chuvash people claim to have originated from the Volga Bulgars.\nEtymology and origin.\nThe etymology of the ethnonym \"Bulgar\" is not completely understood and difficult to trace back earlier than the 4th century AD. Since the work of Tomaschek (1873), it is generally said to be derived from Proto-Turkic root *\"bulga-\" (\"to stir\", \"to mix\"; \"to become mixed\"), which with the consonant suffix \"-r\" implies a noun meaning \"mixed\". \nOther scholars have added that \"bul\u011fa\" might also imply \"stir\", \"disturb\", \"confuse\" and Talat Tekin interpreted \"Bulgar\" as the verb form \"mixing\" (i.e. rather than the adjective \"mixed\"). Both Gyula N\u00e9meth and Peter Benjamin Golden initially advocated the \"mixed race\" theory, but later, like Paul Pelliot, considered that \"to incite\", \"rebel\", or \"to produce a state of disorder\", i.e. the \"disturbers\", was a more likely etymology for migrating nomads.\nAccording to Osman Karatay, if the \"mixed\" etymology relied on the westward migration of the O\u011furs, meeting and merging with the Huns, north of the Black Sea, it was a faulty theory, since the Oghurs were documented in Europe as early as 463, while the Bulgars were not mentioned until 482 \u2013 an overly short time period for any such ethnogenesis to occur.\nHowever, the \"mixing\" in question may have occurred before the Bulgars migrated from further east, and scholars such as Sanping Chen have noted analogous groups in Inner Asia, with phonologically similar names, who were frequently described in similar terms: during the 4th century, the \"Buluoji\" (Middle Chinese \"b'uo-lak-kiei\"), a component of the \"Five Barbarian\" groups in Ancient China, were portrayed as both a \"mixed race\" and \"troublemakers\". Peter A. Boodberg noted that the \"Buluoji\" in the Chinese sources were recorded as remnants of the Xiongnu confederation, and had strong Caucasian elements.\nAnother theory linking the Bulgars to a Turkic people of Inner Asia has been put forward by Boris Simeonov, who identified them with the \"Pugu\" (\u50d5\u9aa8; \"buk/buok kw\u0259t\"; \"Buqut\"), a Tiele and/or Toquz Oguz tribe. The Pugu were mentioned in Chinese sources from 103 BC up to the 8th century AD, and later were situated among the eastern Tiele tribes, as one of the highest-ranking tribes after the Uyghurs.\nAccording to the \"Chronicle\" by Michael the Syrian, which comprises several historical events of different age into one story, three mythical Scythian brothers set out on a journey from the mountain Imaon (Tian Shan) in Asia and reached the river Tanais (Don), the country of the Alans called Barsalia, which would be later inhabited by the Bulgars and the Pugurs (\"Puguraje\").\nThe names Ono\u011fur and Bulgar were linked by later Byzantine sources for reasons that are unclear.Tekin derived \"-gur\" from the Altaic suffix \"-gir\". Generally, modern scholars consider the terms \"o\u011fuz\" or \"o\u011fur\", as generic terms for Turkic tribal confederations, to be derived from Turkic \"*og/uq\", meaning \"kinship or being akin to\". The terms initially were not the same, as \"oq/ogsiz\" meant \"arrow\", while \"o\u011ful\" meant \"offspring, child, son\", \"o\u011fu\u0161/u\u011fu\u0161\" was \"tribe, clan\", and the verb \"o\u011f\u0161a-/oq\u0161a\" meant \"to be like, resemble\".\nThere also appears to be an etymological association between the Bulgars and the preceding Kutrigur (\"Kuturgur\" &gt; \"Qutur\u011fur\" &gt; \"*Toqur(o)\u011fur\" &lt; \"toqur\"; \"nine\" in Proto-Bulgar; \"toquz\" in Common Turkic) and Utigur (\"Uturgur\" &gt; \"Utur\u011fur\" &lt; \"utur/otur\"; \"thirty\" in Proto-Bulgar; \"otuz\" in Common Turkic) \u2013 as \"'O\u011fur\" (Oghur) tribes, with the ethnonym Bulgar as a \"spreading\" adjective. Golden considered the origin of the Kutrigurs and Utigurs to be obscure and their relationship to the Onogurs and Bulgars \u2013 who lived in similar areas at the same time \u2013 as unclear.\nHe noted, however, an implication that the Kutrigurs and Utigurs were related to the \u0160ara\u011furs (\"\u0161ara o\u011fur\", \"shara oghur\"; \"white o\u011fhurs\"), and that according to Procopius these were Hunnish tribal unions, of partly Cimmerian descent. Karatay considered the Kutrigurs and Utigurs to be two related, ancestral people, and prominent tribes in the later Bulgar union, but different from the Bulgars.\nAmong many other theories regarding the etymology of Bulgar, the following have also had limited support.\nHistory.\nTurkic migration.\n The original homeland of the early Bulgars is still unclear. Their homeland is believed to be situated in Kazakhstan and the North Caucasian steppes. Interaction with the Hunnic tribes, causing the migration, may have occurred there, but the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe seems a more likely location. Some scholars propose that the Bulgars may have been a branch or offshoot of the Huns or at least Huns seem to have been absorbed by the Onogur-Bulgars after Dengizich's death. Hyun Jin Kim however, argues that the Huns continued under Ernak, becoming the Kutrigur and Utigur Hunno-Bulgars. These conclusions remain a topic of ongoing debate and controversy among scholars.\nThe first clear mention and evidence of the Bulgars was in 480, when they served as the allies of the Byzantine Emperor Zeno (474\u2013491) against the Ostrogoths. Anachronistic references about them can also be found in the 7th-century geography work \"Ashkharatsuyts\" by Anania Shirakatsi, where the \"Kup'i Bulgar\", \"Duch'i Bulkar\", \"Olkhontor B\u0142kar\" and immigrant \"Ch'dar Bulkar\" tribes are mentioned as being in the North Caucasian-Kuban steppes. An obscure reference to \"Ziezi ex quo Vulgares\", with Ziezi being an offspring of Biblical Shem, is in the \"Chronography of 354\".\nThe Armenian history of Movses Khorenatsi (5th century or later) speaks about two migrations of the Bulgars from the Caucasus to Armenia. The first migration is mentioned in association with the campaign of Armenian ruler Valarshak to the lands \"named Basen by the ancients... and which were afterwards populated by immigrants of the Vlendur Bulgar Vund, after whose name they (the lands) were named Vanand\". In fact, the name Vanand is attested prior to the appearance of the Bulgars. Grigor Khalatians and Josef Markwart connected the name \"Vlendur\" with the \"Olkhontor\" mentioned in the \"Ashkharatsuyts\", while Stepan Malkhasiants considered it a form of the Mongolian word \"baghatur\" 'hero'.\nThe second migration took place during the time of the ruler Arshak, when \"great disturbances occurred in the range of the great Caucasus mountain, in the land of the Bulgars, many of whom migrated and came to our lands and settled south of Kokh\". While Khorenatsi discusses these migrations in the context of the 2nd century BC, it has been suggested that Khorenatsi confused events from the second half of the 4th century AD with earlier occurrences; thus, the migration may have occurred during the reign of King Arshak III of Armenia. The \"disturbances\" which caused them are believed to be the expansion of the Huns in the East European steppes. Dimitrov recorded that the toponyms of the Bolha and Vorotan rivers, tributaries of the Aras river, are known as \"Bolgaru-chaj\" and \"Vanand-chaj\", and could confirm the Bulgar settlement of Armenia.\nAround 463 AD, the Akatziroi and other tribes that had been part of the Hunnic union were attacked by the \u0160ara\u011furs, one of the first O\u011furic Turkic tribes that entered the Ponto-Caspian steppes as the result of migrations set off in Inner Asia. According to Priscus, in 463 the representatives of \u0160ara\u011fur, O\u011fur and Ono\u011fur came to the Emperor in Constantinople, and explained they had been driven out of their homeland by the Sabirs, who had been attacked by the Avars. This tangle of events indicates that the O\u011furic tribes are related to the Ting-ling and Tiele people. It seems that Kutrigurs and Unigurs arrived with the initial waves of O\u011furic peoples entering the Pontic steppes. The Bulgars were not mentioned in 463.\nThe account by Paul the Deacon in his \"History of the Lombards\" (8th century) says that at the beginning of the 5th century in the North-Western slopes of the Carpathians the \"Vulgares\" killed the Lombard king Agelmund. Scholars attribute this account to the Huns, Avars or some Bulgar groups who were probably carried away by the Huns to the Central Europe. The Lombards, led by their new king Laimicho, rose up and defeated the Bulgars with great slaughter, gaining great booty and confidence as they \"became bolder in undertaking the toils of war.\"\nThe defeated Bulgars then became subjects of the Lombards and later migrated in Italy with their king Alboin. When the army of Ostrogoth chieftain Theodoric Strabo grew to 30,000-men strong, it was felt as a menace to Byzantine Emperor Zeno, who somehow managed to convince the Bulgars to attack the Thracian Goths. The Bulgars were eventually defeated by Strabo in 480/481. In 486 and 488 they fought against the Goths again, first as allies of Byzantium, according to Magnus Felix Ennodius, and later as allies of the Gepids, according to Paul the Deacon. However, when Theoderic the Great with his Ostrogoths departed for Italy in 489, the Illyricum and Thrace were open for Bulgar raids.\nIn 493, according to Marcellinus Comes, they defeated and killed magister militum Julian. In 499, they crossed the Danube and reached Thrace where on the banks of the river Tzurta (considered a tributary of Maritsa) defeated a 15,000-strong Roman army led by magister militum Aristus. In 502, Bulgars again devastated Thrace as reportedly there were no Roman soldiers to oppose them. In 528\u2013529 they again invaded the region and defeated Roman generals Justin and Baduarius. However, the Gothic general Mundus offered allegiance to Emperor Justinian I (527\u2013565) in 530, and managed to kill 5,000 Bulgars plundering Thrace. John Malalas recorded that in the battle a Bulgar warlord was captured. In 535, magister militum Sittas defeated the Bulgar army at the river Yantra.\nEnnodius, Jordanes and Procopius identified the Bulgars with the Huns in a 6th-century literary topos, in which Ennodius referred to a captured Bulgar horse as \"equum Huniscum\". In 505, the alleged 10,000 Hun horsemen in the Sabinian army, which was defeated by the Ostrogoths, are believed to be the Bulgars. In 515, Bulgar mercenaries were listed along with others from the Goths, Scythians and Hunnic tribes as part of the Vitalian army. In 539, two Hunnic \"kinglets\" defeated two Roman generals during the raid into Scythia Minor and Moesia.\nA Roman army led by magister militum Ascum and Constantiolus intercepted and defeated them in Thrace; however, another raiding party ambushed and captured the two Roman generals. In 539 and 540, Procopius reported a powerful Hunnic army crossed the Danube, devastated Illyricum and reached up to the Anastasian Wall. Such large distances covered in a short time indicate they were horsemen.\nJordanes described, in his work \"Getica\" (551), the Pontic steppe beyond the Akatziri, above the Pontic Sea, as the habitat of the \"Bulgari\", \"whom the evils of our sins have made famous\". In this region, the \"Hunni\" divided into two tribes: the \"Altziagiri\" (who trade and live next to Cherson) and \"Saviri\", while the \"Hunuguri\" (believed to be the Ono\u011furs) were notable for the marten skin trade. In the Middle Ages, marten skin was used as a substitute for minted money.\nThe Syriac translation of Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor's \"Ecclesiastical History\" (c. 555) in Western Eurasia records:\nThe land Bazgun... extends up to the Caspian Gates and to the sea, which are in the Hunnish lands. Beyond the gates live the Burgars (Bulgars), who have their language, and are people pagan and barbarian. They have towns. And the Alans \u2013 they have five towns... Avnagur (Aunagur, considered Ono\u011furs) are people, who live in tents\nThen he records 13 tribes, the \"wngwr\" (Onogur), \"wgr\" (O\u011fur), \"sbr\" (Sabir), \"bwrgr\" (Bur\u011fa, i.e. Bulgar), \"kwrtrgr\" (Kutri\u011furs), \"br\" (probably Vars, also known as the Avars), \"ksr\" (\"Kasr\"; possibly Akatziri), \"srwrgwr\" (Saragurs), \"dyrmr\" (unknown), \"b'grsyq\" (\"Bagrasir\", i.e. Barsil), \"kwls\" (unknown), \"bdl\" (probably Abdali), and \"ftlyt\" (Hephthalite) ... They are described in typical phrases reserved for nomads in the ethnographic literature of the period, as people who \"live in tents, earn their living on the meat of livestock and fish, of wild animals and by their weapons (plunder)\".\nAgathias (c. 579\u2013582) wrote:\n...all of them are called in general Scythians and Huns in particular according to their nation. Thus, some are Koutrigours or Outigours and yet others are Oultizurs and Bourougounds... the Oultizurs and Bourougounds were known up to the time of the Emperor Leo (457\u2013474) and the Romans of that time and appeared to have been strong. We, however, in this day, neither know them, nor, I think, will we. Perhaps, they have perished or perhaps they have moved off to very far place.\nAccording to D. Dimitrov, scholars partially managed to identify and locate the Bulgar groups mentioned in the Armenian \"Ashkharatsuyts\". The \"Olxontor B\u0142kar\" is one of the variations used for the Ono\u011furs Bulgars, while others could be related to the ancient river names, such as the \"Kup'i Bulgar\" and the Kuban (Kuphis). The \"Du\u010d'i\" could read \"Kuchi Bulkar\" and as such could be related to the Dnieper (Kocho). However, the \"\u010c'dar Bulkar\" location is unclear. Dimitrov theorized that the differences in the \"Bulgar\" ethnonym could be due to the dialect differentiations in their language.\nBy the middle of the 6th century, the Bulgars momentarily fade from the sources and the Kutrigurs and Utigurs come to the front. Between 548 and 576, mostly due to Justinian I (527\u2013565), through diplomatic persuasion and bribery the Kutrigurs and Utigurs were drawn into mutual warfare, decimating one another. In the end, the Kutrigurs were overwhelmed by the Avars, while the Utigurs came under the rule of the Western Turks.\nThe O\u011furs and Ono\u011furs, in the 6th- and 7th-century sources, were mentioned mostly in connection with the Avar and Turk conquest of Western Eurasia. From the 8th century, the Byzantine sources often mention the Ono\u011furs in close connection with the Bulgars. Agathon (early 8th century) wrote about the nation of Ono\u011furs Bul\u011fars. Nikephoros I (early 9th century) noted that Kubrat was the lord of the \"Ono\u011fundurs\"; his contemporary Theophanes referred to them as \"Ono\u011fundur\u2013Bul\u011fars\".\nConstantine VII (mid-10th century) remarked that the Bul\u011fars formerly called themselves \"Ono\u011fundurs\". This association was previously mirrored in Armenian sources, such as the \"Ashkharatsuyts\", which refers to the \"Olxontor B\u0142kar\", and the 5th century \"History\" by Movses Khorenatsi, which includes an additional comment from a 9th-century writer about the colony of the V\u0142\u0115ndur Bu\u0142kar. Marquart and Golden connected these forms with the \"I\u0121ndr\" (*Ulu\u0121undur) of Ibn al-Kalbi (c. 820), the \"Vnndur\" (*Wunundur) of Hudud al-'Alam (982), the \"Wlndr\" (*Wulundur) of Al-Masudi (10th century) and Hungarian name for Belgrad \"N\u00e1ndor Fej\u00e9rv\u00e1r\", the \"nndr\" (*Nandur) of Gard\u012bz\u012b (11th century) and \"*Wununtur\" in the letter by the Khazar King Joseph. All the forms show the phonetic changes typical of later O\u011furic (prothetic v-).\nScholars consider it unclear how this union came about, viewing it as a long process in which a number of different groups were merged. During that time, the Bulgars may have represented a large confederation including the remnants of Ono\u011furs, Utigurs and Kutrigurs among others.\nOld Great Bulgaria.\nThe Turk rule weakened sometime after 600, allowing the Avars to reestablish the control over the region. As the Western Turkic Khaganate declined, finally collapsing in the middle of the 7th century, it was against Avar rule that the Bulgars, recorded as \"Ono\u011fundur\u2013Bul\u011fars\", reappeared. They revolted under their leader Kubrat (c. 635), who seems to have been prepared by Heraclius (610\u2013641) against the Sasanian\u2013Avar alliance. With his uncle Organa in 619, Kubrat had been baptized in Constantinople. He founded the Old Great Bulgaria (\"Magna Bulgaria\"), also known as \"Ono\u011fundur\u2013Bul\u011fars\" state, or \"Patria Onoguria\" in the \"Ravenna Cosmography\".\nLittle is known about Kubrat's activities. It is considered that Onogur Bulgars remained the only steppe tribes in good relations with the Byzantines. His date of death is placed between 650 and 663 AD. According to Nikephoros I, Kubrat instructed his five sons to \"never separate their place of dwelling from one another, so that by being in concordance with one another, their power might thrive\".\nSubsequent events proved Old Great Bulgaria to be only a loose tribal union, as there emerged a rivalry between the Khazars and the Bulgars over Turk patrimony and dominance in the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe. Some historians consider the war an extension of the Western Turks struggle, between the \"Nushibi\" tribes and Ashina clan, who led the Khazars, and the \"Duolu/Tu-lu\" tribes, which some scholars associated with the Dulo clan, from which Kubrat and many Bulgar rulers originated. The Khazars were ultimately victorious and parts of the Bulgar union broke up.\nSubsequent migrations.\nIt is unclear whether the brothers' parting ways was caused by the internal conflicts or strong Khazar pressure. The latter is considered more likely. The Bulgars led by the first two brothers Batbayan and Kotrag remained in the Pontic steppe zone, where they were known as \"Black Bulgars\" by Byzantine and Rus sources, and became Khazar vassals. The Bulgars led by Kotrag migrated to the middle Volga region during the 7th and 9th centuries, where they founded Volga Bulgaria, with Bolghar as its capital.\nAccording to Ahmad ibn Rustah (10th century), the Volga Bulgars were divided into three branches: \"the first branch was called Bersula (Barsils), the second Esegel, and the third Bulgar\". In 922 they accepted Islam as the official religion. They preserved their national identity well into the 13th century by repelling the first Mongol attacks in 1223. They were eventually subdued by the Mongols in 1237. They gradually lost their identity after 1431 when their towns and region were captured by the Russians.\nThe third and most famous son, Asparukh, according to Nikephoros I:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;crossed the river Danapros and Danastros, lived in the locale around the Ister, having occupied a place suitable for settlement, called in their language \u03bf\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd (ogglon; Slav. \"o(n)gl\", \"angle\", \"corner\"; Turk. \"agyl\", \"yard\")... The people having been divided and scattered, the tribe of the Khazars, from within Berulia (Bessarabia), which neighbors with Sarmatia, attacked them with impunity. They overran all the lands lying behind the Pontos Euxeinos and penetrated to the sea. After this, having made Bayan a subject, they forced him to pay tribute.\nAsparukh, according to the \"Pseudo\"\u2013Zacharias Rhetor, \"fled from the Khazars out of the Bulgarian mountains\". In the Khazar ruler Joseph's letter is recorded \"in the country in which I live, there formerly lived the Vununtur (&lt; Vunundur &lt; Ono\u011fundur). Our ancestors, the Khazars warred with them. The Vununtur were more numerous, as numerous as the sand by the sea, but they could not withstand the Khazars. They left their country and fled... until they reached the river called Duna (Danube)\".\nThis migration and the foundation of the Danube Bulgaria (the First Bulgarian Empire) is usually dated c. 681. The composition of the horde is unknown, and sources only mention tribal names \u010cakarar, Kubiar, K\u00fcriger, and clan names Dulo, Ukil/Vokil, Ermiyar, Ugain and Duar. The \"Onglos\" where Bulgars settled is considered northern Dobruja, secured to the West and North by Danube and its Delta, and bounded to the East by the Black Sea. They re-settled in North-Eastern Bulgaria, between Shumen and Varna, including Ludogorie plateau and southern Dobruja. The distribution of pre-Christian burial assemblages in Bulgaria and Romania is considered as the indication of the confines of the Bulgar settlement.In the Balkans they merged with the Slavs and other autochthonous Romance and Greek speaking population, like the Thracians and Vlachs, becoming a political and military elite. However, the influence of the pre-Slavic population had relatively little influence on the Slavs and Bulgars, indicating their population was reduced in previous centuries. The hinterlands of the Byzantine territory were for years occupied by many groups of Slavs. According to Theophanes, the Bulgars subjugated the so-called Seven Slavic tribes, of which the Severians were re-settled from the pass of Beregaba or Veregava, most likely the Rish Pass of the Balkan Mountains, to the East, while the other six tribes to the Southern and Western regions as far the boundary with the Pannonian Avars. Scholars consider that the absence of any source recording the Slavic resistance to the invasion was because it was in their interest to be liberated from the Byzantine taxation.\nIt is considered that the Slavic tribal organization was left intact, and paid tribute to the ruling Bulgars. According to Nikephoros I and Theophanes, an unnamed fourth brother, believed to be Kuber, \"having crossed the river Ister, resides in Pannonia, which is now under the sway of the Avars, having made an alliance with the local peoples\". Kuber later led a revolt against the Avars and with his people moved as far as the region of Thessaloniki in Greek Macedonia. The fifth brother, reported by Nikephoros I and Theophanes, \"settling in the five Ravennate cities became a subject of the Romans\". This brother is believed to be Alcek, who after a stay in Avar territory left and settled in Italy, in Sepino, Bojano and Isernia. These Bulgars preserved their speech and identity until the late 8th century.\nThe First Bulgarian Empire (681\u20131018) had a significant political influence in the Balkans. In the time of Tervel (700\u2013721) the Bulgars helped Byzantines two times, in 705 the Emperor Justinian II to regain his throne, and 717\u2013718 defeating the Arabs during the siege of Constantinople. Sevar (738\u2013753) was the last ruler from the Dulo clan, and the period until c. 768\u2013772 was characterized by the Byzantino-Bulgar conflict and internal crisis. In the short period followed seven rulers from the Uokil and Ugain clan. Telerig (768\u2013777) managed to establish a pacific policy with Byzantium, and restore imperial power.\nDuring the reign of Krum (803\u2013814), the Empire doubled its size, including new lands in Macedonia and Serbia. He also successfully repelled the invading force of the Byzantines, as well defeated the Pannonian Avars where additionally extended the Empire size. In 865, during the reign of Khan Boris I (852\u2013889), the Bulgars accepted Christianity as the official religion, and Eastern Orthodoxy in 879. The greatest expansion of the Empire and prosperity during the time of Simeon I (893\u2013927) is considered as the Bulgarian Golden Age. However, from the time of Peter I (927\u2013969) their power declined. The Hungarians, Kievan Rus' Slavs, as well Pechenegs and Cumans held many raids into their territory, and so weakened were eventually conquered in 1018 by the Byzantine Empire.\nSociety.\nBulgars had the typical culture of the nomadic equestrians of Central Asia, who migrated seasonally in pursuit of good pastures, as well attraction to economic and cultural interaction with sedentary societies. Being in contact with sedentary cultures, they began mastering the crafts of blacksmithing, pottery, and carpentry. The politically dominant tribe or clan usually gave its name to the tribal confederation. Such confederations were often encouraged by the Imperial powers, for whom it was easier to deal with one ruler than several tribal chieftains.\nIn nomadic society the tribes were political organizations based on kinship, with diffused power. Tribes developed according to the relation with sedentary states, and only managed to conquer them when had social cohesion. If the raiding by the nomads had negative effect on the economic development of the region it could significantly slow down their own social and cultural development. In a nomadic state the nomad and sedentary integration was limited, and usually had vassal tribute system.\nWhen the Bulgars arrived in the Balkans their first generations probably still lived a nomadic life in yurts, but they quickly adopted the sunken-featured building of rectangular plan and sedentary or seasonal lifestyle of the Slavs and autochthonous population. The Bulgar and Slavic settlements cannot be distinguished other than by the type of biritual cemeteries.\nSocial structure.\nThe Bulgars, at least the Danubian Bulgars, had a well-developed clan and military administrative system of \"inner\" and \"outer\" tribes, governed by the ruling clan. They had many titles, and according to Steven Runciman the distinction between titles which represented offices and mere ornamental dignities was somewhat vague. Maenchen-Helfen theorized that the titles of the steppe peoples did not reflect the ethnicity of their bearers. According to Magnus Felix Ennodius, the Bulgars did not have nobility, yet their leaders and common men became noblemen on the battle field, indicating social mobility.\nTribute-paying sedentary vassals, such as the Slavs and Greek-speaking population, formed a substantial and important part of the \"khanate\"'s maintenance.\nAlthough it was not recorded on inscriptions, the title \"sampses\" is considered to be related to the royal court. The title \"tabare\" or \"iltabare\", which derives from the old Turkish \"\u00e4lt\u00e4b\u00e4r\", like \"sampses\" is not mentioned on inscriptions, but is related to the legates and ambassadors.\nThe Anastasius Bibliothecarius listed Bulgarian legates at the Council at Constantinople in 869\u2013870. They were mentioned as Stasis, Cerbula, Sundica (\"vagantur\"=\"bagatur\"), Vestranna (\"iltabare\"), Praestizisunas (\"campsis\"), and Alexius Hunno (\"sampsi\"). The ruler title in Bulgar inscriptions was \"khan\" or \"kanasubigi\". A counterpart of the Greek phrase (\"ho ek Theou archon\") was also common in Bulgar inscriptions. The \"kavhan\" was the second most important title in the realm, seemingly chief official. Some Bulgar inscriptions, written in Greek and later in Slavonic, refer to the Bulgarian rulers respectively with the Greek title \"archon\", or the Slavic titles \"knyaz\" and \"tsar\".\nThere are several possible interpretations for the ruler title, \"kana sybigi\", mentioned in six inscriptions by the Khan Omurtag and two by Malamir. Among the proposed translations for \"sybigi\" or \"subigi\" are \"lord of the army\", from the reconstructed Turkic phrase \"syu-beg\" (army master) paralleling the attested Orkhon Turkic \"syubashi\". Runciman and J. B. Bury considered \"ubige\" or \"uvege\" to be related to the Cuman-Turkic \"\u00f6wegh\u00fc\" (high, glorious); \"bright, luminous, heavenly\"; and more recently \"(ruler) from God\", from the Indo-European \"*su-\" and \"baga-\", i.e. \"*su-baga\". Florin Curta noted the resemblance in the use of the \"kana sybigi\" with the Byzantine name and title \"basileus\".Members of the upper social class bore the title \"boila\" (later \"boyar\"). The nobility was divided onto \"small\" and \"great\" boilas. In the 10th century, there were three classes of boyars: the six \"great\" boilas, the \"outer\" boilas, and the \"inner\" boilas, while in the mid-9th century there were twelve \"great\" boyars. The \"great\" boilas occupied military and administrative offices in the state, as well the council where they gathered for decisions on important matters of state.\n\"Baga\u00efns\" were the lesser class of the nobility, probably a military class which also participated in the council. The title \"bagatur\", once as \"bogotor\", is found in several instances within the inscriptions. It derives from Turkish \"bagadur\" (hero) and was a high military rank. The Bulgarian military commander who was defeated by the Croats in the Battle of the Bosnian Highlands (926) was called Alogobotur, which is actually a title comprised by \"alo\" (considered Turkic \"alp, alyp\"; chief) and \"bagatur\".\nThere are several title associations with uncertain meaning, such as \"boila kavkhan\", \"i\u010dirgu boila\", \"kana boila qolovur\", \"bagatur bagain\", \"biri bagain\", \"setit bagain\" and \"ik bagain\". \"Kolober\" (or \"qolovur\"), a rank title, is cited in two inscriptions, and it derives from the Turkish term for a guide, \"golaghuz\". The title \"\u017eupan\", also once as \"kopan\" in the inscriptions, was often mentioned together with the bearer's name. They were traditionally seen as Slavic chiefs. It seems to have meant \"head of a clan-district\", as among the South Slavs (Croats, Serbs) where it was more widely used, it meant \"head of a tribe\" with a high district and court function.\nThe title \"tarkhan\" probably represented a high military rank, similar to the Byzantine \"strategos\", of the military governor of a province. The variations \"kalutarkan\" and \"buliastarkan\" are considered to be officers at the head of the \"tarkans\". Curta interpreted the title \"zhupan tarqan\" as \"tarqan of (all the) zhupans\".\nReligion.\nVery little is known about the religion of the Bulgars, but it is believed to have been monotheistic.\nIn Danube Bulgaria, Bulgar monarchs described themselves as a \"ruler from God\", indicating authority from a singular divine origin, and making appeals to the deity's omniscience. Presian's inscription from Philippi (837) states:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When someone seeks the truth, God sees. And when someone lies, God sees that too. The Bulgars did many favors to the Christians (Byzantines), but the Christians forgot them. But God sees.\nIt is traditionally assumed that the God in question was the Turkic supreme sky deity, Tengri. In the Chinese transcription as \"zhenli\", and Turkic as \"Tangara\" and \"Tengeri\", it represents the oldest known Turco-Mongolian word. Tengri may have originated in the Xiongnu confederacy, which settled on the frontiers of China in the 2nd century BC. The confederacy probably had both pre-Turkic and pre-Mongolian ethnic elements. In modern Turkish, the word for god, \"Tanr\u0131\", derives from the same root.\nTengrism apparently engaged various shamanic practices. According to Mercia MacDermott, Tangra was the male deity connected with sky, light and the Sun. The cult incorporated Tangra's female equivalent and principle goddess, Umay, the deity of fertility. Their tamgha \n, which can be frequently found in early medieval Bulgaria is associated with deity Tangra. However, its exact meaning and use remains unknown. The most sacred creatures to Tangra were horses and eagles, particularly white horses. Bronze amulets with representations of the Sun, horses and other animals were found at Bulgar archeological sites. This could explain the variety of Bulgars taboos, including those about animals.\nRavil Bukharaev believed that such an autocratic and monotheistic religion\u2014henotheism, as seen in the report by Ahmad ibn Fadlan (10th century) about the Oghuz Turks, kindred to the Bulgars, made the acceptance of Islam more natural and easier in Volga Bulgaria:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If someone trouble befalls any of them or there happens any unlucky incident, they look out into the sky and summon: \"Ber Tengre!\". In the Turkish language, that means, \"by the One and Only God!\". Another mention of Tengri is on the severely damaged Greek inscription found on a presumed altar stone near Madara, tentatively deciphered as \"Khan \"sybigi\" Omurtag, ruler from god...was...and made sacrifice to god Tangra...\"itchurgu boila\"...gold\". An Ottoman manuscript recorded that the name of God, in Bulgarian, was \"T\u00e4ngri\".\nA piece of ethnographic evidence which has been invoked to support the belief that the Bulgars worshipped Tengri/Tangra is the relative similarity of the name \"Tengri\" to \"Tur\u0103\", the name of the supreme deity of the traditional religion of the Chuvash people, who are traditionally regarded as descendants of the Volga Bulgars. Nevertheless, the Chuvash religion today is markedly different from Tengrism and can be described as a local form of polytheism, due to pagan beliefs of the Volga Finns, forest dwellers of Finno-Ugric origin who lived in their vicinity, with some elements borrowed from Islam.\nPaganism was closely connected with the old clan system, and the remains of totemism and shamanism were preserved even after the crossing of Danube. The Shumen plate in the archaeological literature is often associated with shamanism. In the 9th century, it was recorded that before a battle the Bulgars \"used to practice enchantments and jests and charms and certain auguries\". Liutprand of Cremona reported that Baian, son of Simeon I (893\u2013927), could through \"magicam\" transform into a wolf. Clement of Ohrid reported the worship of fire and water by the Bulgars, while in the 11th century Theophylact of Ohrid remembered that before the Christianization the Bulgars respected the Sun, Moon and the stars, and sacrificed dogs to them.\nAllegedly, the Dulo clan had the dog as its sacred animal. To this today Bulgarians still use the expression \"he kills the dog\" to mean \"he gives the orders\", a relic of the time when the Dulo Khan sacrificed a dog to the deity Tangra. Remains of dog and deer have been found in Bulgars graves, and it seems the wolf also had a special mythological significance. The Bulgars were bi-ritual, either cremating or burying their dead, and often interred them with personal objects (pottery, rarely weapons or dress), food, and sacred animals.\nBecause of the cult of the Sun, the Bulgars had a preference for the south. Their main buildings and shrines faced south, as well their yurts, which were usually entered from the south, although less often from the east. Excavations showed that Bulgars buried their dead on a north\u2013south axis, with their heads to the north so that the deceased \"faced\" south. The Slavs practiced only cremation, the remains were placed in urns, and like the Bulgars, with the conversion to Christianity inhumed the dead on west\u2013east axis. The only example of a mixed Bulgar-Slavic cemetery is in Istria near ancient Histria, on the coast of the Black Sea.\nD. Dimitrov has argued that the Kuban Bulgars also adopted elements of Iranian religious beliefs. He noticed Iranian influences on the cult of the former Caucasian Huns capital Varachan (Balanjar), making a religious syncretism between the principal Turkic deity Tengri and the Iranian sun god Hvare. Dimitrov cited the work by V.A. Kuznetsov, who considered the resemblance between the layout of the Zoroastrian temples of fire and the Kuban Bulgar centre, Humarin citadel, situated 11\u00a0km to the north of the town Karachayevsk, where the pottery belonged to the Saltovo-Mayaki culture.\nKuznecov also found a connection in the plan of the Danube Bulgars sanctuaries at Pliska, Veliki Preslav, and Madara. The architectural similarities include two squares of ashlars inserted one into another, oriented towards the summer sunrise. One of these sites was transformed into a Christian church, which is taken as evidence that they served a religious function.\nThe view of the Parthian and Sasanian influence, which Franz Altheim also argued, is considered debatable, showing the cultural impact of the Iranian world on communities in the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe. Many scholars believe that the square shape, with the north\u2013south and east\u2013west axis of the Bulgar sacral monuments is very similar to those of Turkic khagans in Mongolia. However, that the Bulgar residence in Pliska and Palace of Omurtag were inspired by the Byzantine architecture is considered indisputable.\nChristianity had already begun to penetrate, probably via their Slavic subjects, when it was adopted in the First Bulgarian Empire by Knyaz Boris I in 865 as a state religion. There was interest in Islam as well, seen in the book \"Answers to the Questions of the King of the Burgar addressed to him about Islam and Unity\" by the Abbasid caliph Al-Ma'mun (813\u2013833) for the Pontic/Bosporan Bulgars, while it was officially adopted in Volga Bulgaria as a state religion in 922.\nLanguage.\nThe origin and language of the Bulgars has been the subject of debate since around the start of the 20th century. It is generally accepted that at least the Bulgar elite spoke a language that was a member of the Oghur branch of the Turkic language family, alongside the now extinct Khazar and the solitary survivor of these languages, Chuvash.\nAlthough there is no direct evidence, a group of linguists believe that Chuvash may be descendant from a dialect of Volga Bulgar while others support the idea that Chuvash is another distinct Oghur Turkic language. Some scholars suggest Hunnish had strong ties with Bulgar and to modern Chuvash and refer to this extended grouping as separate Hunno-Bulgar languages. However, such speculations are not based on proper linguistic evidence, since the language of the Huns is almost unknown except for a few attested words and personal names. Scholars generally consider Hunnish as unclassifiable.\nAccording to P. Golden this association is apparent from the fragments of texts and isolated words and phrases preserved in inscriptions. In addition to language, their culture and state structure retain many Central Asian features. Military and hierarchical terms such as \"khan/qan\", \"kanasubigi\", \"qapa\u011fan\", \"tarkan\", \"bagatur\" and \"boila\" appear to be of Turkic origin. The Bulgar calendar within the \"Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans\" had a twelve-year animal cycle, similar to the one adopted by Turkic and Mongolic peoples from the Chinese, with animal names and numbers deciphered as Turkic. Tengri (in Bulgar \"Tangra/Tengre\") was their supreme god.\nDanubian Bulgar inscriptions were written mostly in Greek or Cyrillic characters, most commonly in Greek or Graeco-Bulgar, others in the Kuban alphabet which is a variant of Orkhon script. they apparently have a sacral meaning. Inscriptions sometimes included Slavic terms, thus allowing scholars to identify some of the Bulgar glosses. Altheim argued that the runes were brought into Europe from Central Asia by the Huns, and were an adapted version of the old Sogdian alphabet in the Hunnic/Oghur Turkic language. The custom of stone engravings are considered to have Iranic, Turkic and Roman parallels. The Madara Rider resembles work of the Sasanian rock relief tradition, but its actual masonry tradition and cultural source is unknown.\nAccording to linguist and academician Albina G. Khayrullina-Valieva Bulgar language was the first fully proved Turkic language that came into direct contact with South Slavs. The Danubian Bulgars were unable to alter the predominantly Slavic character of Bulgaria, seen in the toponymy and names of the capitals Pliska and Preslav. They preserved their own native language and customs for about 200 years, but a bilingual period was recorded since the 9th century. Golden argued that Bulgar Turkic almost disappeared with the transition to Christianity and Slavicisation in the middle of the 9th century. When the ruling class abandoned its native language and adopted Slavic, according to Jean W. Sedlar, it was so complete that no trace of Turkic speech patterns remained in Old Slavic texts. The Bulgarian Christian Church used the Slavic dialect from Macedonia.\nAmong Bulgarian academics, notably Petar Dobrev, a hypothesis linking the Bulgar language to the Iranic languages (especially Pamir) has been popular since the 1990s. Most proponents still assume an intermediate stance, proposing certain signs of Iranic influence on a Turkic substrate. The names Asparukh and Bezmer from the \"Nominalia\" list, for example, were established as being of Iranic origin. Other Bulgarian scholars actively oppose the \"Iranic hypothesis\". According to Raymond Detrez, the Iranian theory is rooted in the periods of anti-Turkish sentiment in Bulgaria and is ideologically motivated. Since 1989, anti-Turkish rhetoric is now reflected in the theories that challenge the thesis of the proto-Bulgars' Turkic origin. Alongside the Iranian or Aryan theory, there appeared arguments favoring an autochthonous origin.\nEthnicity.\nDue to the lack of definitive evidence, modern scholarship uses an ethnogenesis approach in explaining the Bulgars origin. More recent theories view the nomadic confederacies, such as the Bulgars, as the formation of several different cultural, political and linguistic entities that could dissolve as quickly as they formed, entailing a process of ethnogenesis.\nAccording to Walter Pohl, the existential fate of the tribes and their confederations depended on their ability to adapt to an environment going through rapid changes, and to give this adaptation a credible meaning rooted in tradition and ritual. Slavs and Bulgars succeeded because their form of organization proved as stable and as flexible as necessary, while the Pannonian Avars failed in the end because their model could not respond to new conditions. Pohl wrote that members of society's lower strata did not feel themselves to be part of any large-scale ethnic group; the only distinct classes were within the armies and the ruling elite.\nRecent studies consider ethnonyms closely related with warrior elites who ruled over a variety of heterogeneous groups. The groups adopted new ideology and name as political designation, while the elites claimed right to rule and royal descent through origin myths.\nWhen the Turkic tribes began to enter into the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe in the Post-Hunnic era, or as early as the 2nd century AD, their confederations incorporated an array of ethnic groups of newly joined Turkic, Caucasian, Iranian, and Finno-Ugric peoples. During their Western Eurasian migrations to the Balkans, they also came into contact with Armenian, Semitic, Slavic, Thracian and Anatolian Greek among other populations.\nFrom the 6th to 8th centuries, distinctive Bulgar monuments of the Sivashovka type were built upon ruins of the late Sarmatian culture of the 2nd to 4th centuries AD, and the 6th century Penkovka culture of the Antes and Slavs. Early medieval Saltovo-Mayaki (an Alanic-based culture) settlements in the Crimea since the 8th century were destroyed by the Pechengs during the 10th century.\nAlthough the older Iranian tribes were enveloped by the widespread Turkic migration into the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe, the following centuries saw a complete disappearance of both the Iranic and Turkic languages, indicating dominance of the Slavic language among the common people.\nAnthropology and genetics.\nAccording to a paleo-DNA study from 2019 which examined Medieval burials in the Carpathian Basin a closest connection was found between the Y-DNA of these nomadic people and the modern Volga Tatars. According to Hungarian archeogenetist Nepar\u00e1czki Endre: \"From all recent and archaic populations tested the Volga Tatars show the smallest genetic distance to the entire Conqueror population\" and \"a direct genetic relation of the Conquerors to Onogur-Bulgar ancestors of these groups is very feasible.\"\nThe paleoanthropological material from all sites in Volga region, Ukraine and Moldova attributed to the Bulgars testify complex ethno-cultural processes. The material shows the assimilation between the local population and the migrating newcomers. In all sites can be traced the anthropological type found in the Zlivka necropolis near the village of Ilichevki, the district of Donetsk, of brachiocranic Caucasoid with small East Asian admixtures but with Bulgar males being more Mongoloid than females.\nModern genetic research on Central Asian Turkic peoples and ethnic groups related to the Bulgars points to an affiliation with Western Eurasian populations. Despite the morphological proximity, there is a visible impact of the local population, in the Volga region of Volga Finns and Cuman-Kipchaks, in Ukraine of Onogur-Khazars and Sarmatian-Alans, and in Moldova and Thrace of Seven Slavic tribes. The comparative analysis showed large morphological proximity between the medieval and modern population of the Volga region. The examined graves in Northern Bulgaria and Southern Romania showed different somatic types, including Caucasoid-Mediterranean and less often East Asian.\nThe pre-Christian burial customs in Bulgaria indicate diverse social, i.e. nomadic and sedentary, and cultural influences. In some necropolises specific to the Danube Bulgars, artificial deformation was found in 80% of the skulls. The Bulgars had a special type of shamanic \"medicine-men\" who performed trepanations of the skull, usually near the sagittal suture. This practice had a medical application, as well as a symbolic purpose; in two cases the patient had brain problems. According to Maenchen-Helfen and Rashev, the artificial deformation of skulls, and other types of burial artifacts in Bulgars graves, are similar to those of the Sarmatians, and Sarmatized Turks or Turkicized Sarmatians of the post-Hunnic graves in the Ukrainian steppe.\nLegacy.\nIn modern ethnic nationalism there is some \"rivalry for the Bulgar legacy\" (see Bulgarism). The Volga Tatars, Bashkirs and Chuvash people, are said to be descended from the Volga Bulgars, and there may have been ethnogenetic influences on the Hungarians (Magyars) and Karachay-Balkars also.\nThe President of the Bulgar National Congress, Gusman Khalilov appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on the issue of renaming the Tatars into Bulgars, but in 2010 he lost in court.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The amount of urine produced can be nearly 20 liters per day. Reduction of fluid has little effect on the concentration of the urine. Complications may include dehydration or seizures.\nThere are four types of DI, each with a different set of causes.\nDiagnosis is often based on urine tests, blood tests and the fluid deprivation test. Despite the name, diabetes insipidus is unrelated to diabetes mellitus and the conditions have a distinct mechanism, though both can result in the production of large amounts of urine.\nTreatment involves drinking sufficient fluids to prevent dehydration. Other treatments depend on the type. In central and gestational DI, treatment is with desmopressin. Nephrogenic DI may be treated by addressing the underlying cause or by the use of a thiazide, aspirin or ibuprofen. The number of new cases of diabetes insipidus each year is 3 in 100,000. Central DI usually starts between the ages of 10 and 20 and occurs in males and females equally. Nephrogenic DI can begin at any age. The term \"diabetes\" is derived from the Greek word meaning siphon.\nSigns and symptoms.\nExcessive urination and extreme thirst and increased fluid intake (especially for cold water and sometimes ice or ice water) are typical for DI. The symptoms of excessive urination and extreme thirst are similar to what is seen in untreated diabetes mellitus, with the distinction that the urine does not contain glucose. Blurred vision is a rarity. Signs of dehydration may also appear in some individuals since the body cannot properly regulate the amount of the water it takes in.\nExtreme urination continues throughout the day and the night. In children, DI can interfere with appetite, eating, weight gain and growth, as well. They may present with fever, vomiting or diarrhea. Adults with untreated DI may remain healthy for decades as long as enough water is consumed to offset the urinary losses. However, there is a continuous risk of dehydration and loss of potassium that may lead to hypokalemia.\nCause.\nThe several forms of diabetes insipidus are:\nCentral.\nCentral (or \"Neurogenic\") DI has many possible causes. According to the literature, the principal causes of central DI and their oft-cited approximate frequencies are as follows:\nNephrogenic.\nNephrogenic diabetes insipidus is due to the inability of the kidney to respond normally to vasopressin.\nDipsogenic.\nDipsogenic DI or primary polydipsia results from excessive intake of fluids as opposed to deficiency of arginine vasopressin. It may be due to a defect or damage to the thirst mechanism, located in the hypothalamus, or due to mental illness. Treatment with desmopressin may lead to water intoxication.\nGestational.\nGestational DI occurs only during pregnancy and the postpartum period. During pregnancy, women produce vasopressinase in the placenta, which breaks down antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Gestational DI is thought to occur with excessive production and/or impaired clearance of vasopressinase.\nMost cases of gestational DI can be treated with desmopressin (DDAVP), but not vasopressin. In rare cases, however, an abnormality in the thirst mechanism causes gestational DI, and desmopressin should not be used.\nDiabetes insipidus is also associated with some serious diseases of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. These cause DI by impairing hepatic clearance of circulating vasopressinase.\nPathophysiology.\nElectrolyte and volume homeostasis is a complex mechanism that balances the body's requirements for blood pressure and the main electrolytes sodium and potassium. In general, electrolyte regulation precedes volume regulation. When the volume is severely depleted, however, the body will retain water at the expense of deranging electrolyte levels.\nThe regulation of urine production occurs in the hypothalamus, which produces ADH in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. After synthesis, the hormone is transported in neurosecretory granules down the axon of the hypothalamic neuron to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, where it is stored for later release. In addition, the hypothalamus regulates the sensation of thirst in the ventromedial nucleus by sensing increases in serum osmolarity and relaying this information to the cortex.\nNeurogenic/central DI results from a lack of ADH; occasionally it can present with decreased thirst as regulation of thirst and ADH production occur in close proximity in the hypothalamus. It is encountered as a result of hypoxic encephalopathy, neurosurgery, autoimmunity or cancer, or sometimes without an underlying cause (idiopathic).\nThe main effector organ for fluid homeostasis is the kidney. ADH acts by increasing water permeability in the collecting ducts and distal convoluted tubules; specifically, it acts on proteins called aquaporins and more specifically aquaporin 2 in the following cascade. When released, ADH binds to V2 G-protein coupled receptors within the distal convoluted tubules, increasing cyclic AMP, which couples with protein kinase A, stimulating translocation of the aquaporin 2 channel stored in the cytoplasm of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts into the apical membrane. These transcribed channels allow water into the collecting duct cells. The increase in permeability allows for the reabsorption of water into the bloodstream, thus concentrating the urine.\nNephrogenic DI results from a lack of aquaporin channels in the distal collecting duct (decreased surface expression and transcription). It is seen in lithium toxicity, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, or the release of ureteral obstruction. Therefore, a lack of ADH prevents water reabsorption and the osmolarity of the blood increases. With increased osmolarity, the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus detect this change and stimulate thirst. With increased thirst, the person now experiences a polydipsia and polyuria cycle.\nHereditary forms of diabetes insipidus account for less than 10% of the cases of diabetes insipidus seen in clinical practice.\nDiagnosis.\nTo distinguish DI from other causes of excess urination, blood glucose levels, bicarbonate levels, and calcium levels need to be tested. Measurement of blood electrolytes can reveal a high sodium level (hypernatremia as dehydration develops). Urinalysis demonstrates a dilute urine with a low specific gravity. Urine osmolarity and electrolyte levels are typically low.\nA fluid deprivation test is another way of distinguishing DI from other causes of excessive urination. If there is no change in fluid loss, giving desmopressin can determine if DI is caused by:\nThis test measures the changes in body weight, urine output, and urine composition when fluids are withheld to induce dehydration. The body's normal response to dehydration is to conserve water by concentrating the urine. Those with DI continue to urinate large amounts of dilute urine in spite of water deprivation. In primary polydipsia, the urine osmolality should increase and stabilize at above 280 mOsm/kg with fluid restriction, while a stabilization at a lower level indicates diabetes insipidus. Stabilization in this test means, more specifically, when the increase in urine osmolality is less than 30 Osm/kg per hour for at least three hours. Sometimes measuring blood levels of ADH toward the end of this test is also necessary, but is more time-consuming to perform.\nTo distinguish between the main forms, desmopressin stimulation is also used; desmopressin can be taken by injection, a nasal spray, or a tablet. While taking desmopressin, a person should drink fluids or water only when thirsty and not at other times, as this can lead to sudden fluid accumulation in the central nervous system. If desmopressin reduces urine output and increases urine osmolarity, the hypothalamic production of ADH is deficient, and the kidney responds normally to exogenous vasopressin (desmopressin). If the DI is due to kidney pathology, desmopressin does not change either urine output or osmolarity (since the endogenous vasopressin levels are already high).\nWhilst diabetes insipidus usually occurs with polydipsia, it can also rarely occur not only in the absence of polydipsia but in the presence of its opposite, adipsia (or hypodipsia). \"Adipsic diabetes insipidus\" is recognised as a marked absence of thirst even in response to hyperosmolality. In some cases of adipsic DI, the person may also fail to respond to desmopressin.\nIf central DI is suspected, testing of other hormones of the pituitary, as well as magnetic resonance imaging, particularly a pituitary MRI, is necessary to discover if a disease process (such as a prolactinoma, or histiocytosis, syphilis, tuberculosis or other tumor or granuloma) is affecting pituitary function. Most people with this form have either experienced past head trauma or have stopped ADH production for an unknown reason.\nTreatment.\nTreatment involves drinking sufficient fluids to prevent dehydration. Other treatments depend on the type. In central and gestational DI treatment is with desmopressin. Nephrogenic DI may be treated by addressing the underlying cause or the use of a thiazide, aspirin, or ibuprofen.\nCentral.\nCentral DI and gestational DI respond to desmopressin which is given as intranasal or oral tablets. Carbamazepine, an anticonvulsive medication, has also had some success in this type of DI. Also, gestational DI tends to abate on its own in four to six weeks following labor, though some women may develop it again in subsequent pregnancies. In dipsogenic DI, desmopressin is not usually an option.\nNephrogenic.\nDesmopressin will be ineffective in nephrogenic DI which is treated by reversing the underlying cause (if possible) and replacing the free water deficit. A thiazide diuretic, such as chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide, can be used to create mild hypovolemia which encourages salt and water uptake in proximal tubule and thus improve nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Amiloride has additional benefit of blocking Na uptake. Thiazide diuretics are sometimes combined with amiloride to prevent hypokalemia caused by the thiazides. It seems paradoxical to treat an extreme diuresis with a diuretic, and the exact mechanism of action is unknown but the thiazide diuretics will decrease distal convoluted tubule reabsorption of sodium and water, thereby causing diuresis. This decreases plasma volume, thus lowering the glomerular filtration rate and enhancing the absorption of sodium and water in the proximal nephron. Less fluid reaches the distal nephron, so overall fluid conservation is obtained.\nLithium-induced nephrogenic DI may be effectively managed with the administration of amiloride, a potassium-sparing diuretic often used in conjunction with thiazide or loop diuretics. Clinicians have been aware of lithium toxicity for many years, and traditionally have administered thiazide diuretics for lithium-induced polyuria and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. However, amiloride has recently been shown to be a successful treatment for this condition.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"diabetes\" ( or ) comes from Latin , which in turn comes from , which literally means \"a passer through; a siphon\". Ancient Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia (fl. in the first century CE) used that word, with the intended meaning \"excessive discharge of urine\", as the name for the disease. Ultimately, the word comes from Greek (), meaning \"to pass through\", which is composed of - (\"dia\"-), meaning \"through\" and (), meaning \"to go\". The word \"diabetes\" is first recorded in English, in the form \"diabete\", in a medical text written around 1425.\n\"Insipidus\" comes from Latin language (tasteless), from Latin: \"in-\" \"not\" + \"tasty\" from \"sapere\" \"have a taste\"\u2014the full meaning is \"lacking flavor or zest; not tasty\". Application of this name to DI arose from the fact that diabetes insipidus does not cause glycosuria (excretion of glucose into the urine).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term was originally used to refer to any expressive melody, usually, but not always, performed by a singer.\nEtymology.\nThe Italian term \"aria\", which derives from the Greek \u1f00\u03ae\u03c1 and Latin \"aer\" (air), first appeared in relation to music in the 14th century when it simply signified a manner or style of singing or playing. By the end of the 16th century, the term 'aria' refers to an instrumental form (cf. Santino Garsi da Parma lute works, ('Aria del Gran Duca'). By the early 16th century, it was in common use as meaning a simple setting of strophic poetry; melodic madrigals, free of complex polyphony, were known as \"madrigale arioso\".\nIn opera.\nAria form in late 17th century French and Italian opera.\nIn the context of staged works and concert works, arias evolved from simple melodies into structured forms. In such works, the sung, melodic, and structured aria differed from the speech-like (\"parlando\") recitative \u2013 the latter tending to carry the story-line, the former used to convey emotional content and serve as an opportunity for singers to display their vocal talent.\nBy the late 17th century, operatic arias came to be written in one of two forms. Binary form arias were in two sections (A\u2013B); arias in ternary form (A\u2013B\u2013A) were known as \"da capo arias\" (literally 'from the head', i.e. with the opening section repeated, often in a highly decorated manner). In the \"da capo\" aria, the 'B' episode would typically be in a different key \u2013 the dominant or relative major key. Other variants of these forms are found in the French operas of the late 17th century such as those of Jean-Baptiste Lully which dominated the period of the French baroque. Vocal solos in his operas (known of course as the French term, \"airs\") are frequently in extended binary form (ABB') or sometimes in \"rondeau\" form (ABACA), (a shape which is analogous to the instrumental rondo).\nIn the work of Italian composers of the late 17th and early 18th century, the \"da capo\" aria came to be include the \"ritornello\" (literally, 'little return'), a recurring instrumental episode which featured certain phrases of the aria proper and provided, in early operas, the opportunity for dancing or entries of characters. \"Da capo\" aria with \"ritornelli\" became a typifying feature of European opera throughout the 18th century and is thought by some writers to be a direct antecedent of sonata form. The \"ritornelli\" became essential to the structure of the aria \u2013 \"while the words determine the character of a melody the ritornello instruments often decided in what terms it shall be presented.\"\nThe French baroque \"ariette\" and \"air\".\nIn contrast to its name, the \"ariette\" of the French baroque opera, especially in the works of Campra, Rameau and their contemporaries is a fully developed da capo aria much longer than their contemporary \"airs\". The \"ariette\" came as an influence of the aria of the Italian opera seria into French music; they have a rich instrumental accompaniment, an instrumental exposition of the theme and virtuosic melodic writing. They are usually placed standalone in divertissements as they do not advance the action, rather they are celebrations of joy or triumph. Conversely, in the operas of Lully and his successors, \"airs\" or \"airs tendres\" are tiny melodic passages of a few bars, usually in binary form, inserted seamlessly into the recitative.\n18th century.\nBy the early 18th century, composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti had established the aria form, and especially its da capo version with ritornelli, as the key element of \"opera seria\". \"It offered balance and continuity, and yet gave scope for contrast. [...] The very regularity of its conventional features enabled deviations from the normal to be exploited with telling effect.\" In the early years of the century, arias in the Italian style began to take over in French opera, giving rise eventually to the French genre of \"ariette\", normally in a relatively simple ternary form.\nTypes of operatic aria became known by a variety of terms according to their character \u2013 e.g.\"aria parlante\" ('speaking-style', narrative in nature), \"aria di bravura\" (typically given to a heroine), \"aria buffa\" (aria of a comic type, typically given to a bass or bass-baritone), and so on.\nM. F. Robinson describes the standard aria in \"opera seria\" in the period 1720 to 1760 as follows:\nThe first section normally began with an orchestral ritornello after which the singer entered and sang the words of the first stanza in their entirety. By the end of this first vocal paragraph the music, if it were in a major key as it usually was, had modulated to the dominant. The orchestra then played a second ritornello usually shorter than the first. The singer re-entered and sang the same words through a second time. The music of this second paragraph was often slightly more elaborate than that of the first. There were more repeats of words and perhaps more florid vocalisations. The key worked its way back to the tonic for the final vocal cadence after which the orchestra rounded the section off with a final ritornello.\nThe nature and allocation of the arias to the different roles in \"opera seria\" was highly formalized. According to the playwright and librettist Carlo Goldoni, in his autobiography,\nThe three principal personages of the drama ought to sing five arias each; two in the first act, two in the second, and one in the third. The second actress and the second soprano can only have three, and the inferior characters must be satisfied with a single aria each, or two at the most. The author of the words must [...] take care that two pathetic [i.e. melancholy] arias do not succeed one another. He must distribute with the same precaution the bravura arias, the arias of action, the inferior arias, and the minuets and rondeaus. He must, above all things, avoid giving impassioned arias, bravura arias, or rondeaus, to inferior characters.\nBy contrast, arias in \"opera buffa\" (comic opera) were often specific in character to the nature of the character being portrayed (for example the cheeky servant-girl or the irascible elderly suitor or guardian).\nBy later in the century it was clear that these formats were becoming fossilized. Christoph Willibald Gluck thought that both \"opera buffa\" and \"opera seria\" had strayed too far from what opera should really be, and seemed unnatural. The jokes of \"opera buffa\" were threadbare and the repetition of the same characters made them seem no more than stereotypes. In \"opera seria\" the singing was devoted to superficial effects and the content was uninteresting and stale. As in \"opera buffa\", the singers were often masters of the stage and the music, decorating the vocal lines so floridly that audiences could no longer recognise the original melody. Gluck wanted to return opera to its origins, focusing on human drama and passions and making words and music of equal importance. The effects of these Gluckist reforms were seen not only in his own operas but in the later works of Mozart; the arias now become far more expressive of the individual emotions of the characters and are both more firmly anchored in, and advance, the storyline. Richard Wagner was to praise Gluck's innovations in his 1850 essay \"Opera and Drama\": \" The musical composer revolted against the wilfulness of the singer\"; rather than \"unfold[ing] the purely sensuous contents of the Aria to their highest, rankest, pitch\", Gluck sought \"to put shackles on Caprice's execution of that Aria, by himself endeavouring to give the tune [...] an expression answering to the underlying Word-text\". This attitude was to underlie Wagner's would-be deconstruction of aria in his concept of \"Gesamtkunstwerk\".\n19th century.\nDespite the ideals of Gluck, and the trend to organise libretti so that arias had a more organic part in the drama rather than merely interrupting its flow, in the operas of the early 19th century, (for example those of Gioachino Rossini and Gaetano Donizetti), bravura arias remained focal attractions, and they continued to play a major role in grand opera, and in Italian opera through the 19th century.\nA favoured form of aria in the first half of the 19th century in Italian opera was the \"cabaletta\", in which a songlike \"cantabile\" section is followed by a more animated section, the \"cabaletta\" proper, repeated in whole or in part. Typically such arias would be preceded by recitative, the whole sequence being termed a \"scena\". There might also be opportunities for participation by orchestra or chorus. An example is \"Casta diva\" from the opera \"Norma\" of Vincenzo Bellini.\nAfter around 1850, aria forms in Italian opera began to show more variety \u2013 many of the operas of Giuseppe Verdi offer extended narrative arias for leading roles that enable, in their scope, intensification of drama and characterisation. Examples include Rigoletto's condemnation of the court, \"Cortigiani, vil razza dannata!\" (1851).\nLater in the century, the post-1850 operas of Wagner were through-composed, with fewer elements being readily identifiable as self-contained arias; whilst the Italian genre of verismo opera also sought to integrate arioso elements although still allowing some 'show-pieces'.\nConcert arias.\nConcert arias, which are not part of any larger work, (or were sometimes written to replace or insert arias in their own operas or operas of other composers) were written by composers to provide the opportunity for vocal display for concert singers; examples are \"\", Op. 65, by Beethoven, and a number of concert arias by Mozart, including \"Conservati fedele\".\nInstrumental music.\nThe term 'aria' was frequently used in the 17th and 18th centuries for instrumental music modelled on vocal music. For example, J. S. Bach's so-called \"Goldberg Variations\" were titled at their 1741 publication \"Clavier Ubung bestehend in einer ARIA mit verschiedenen Ver\u00e6nderungen\" (\"Keyboard exercise, consisting of one ARIA with diverse variations.\")\nThe word is sometimes used in contemporary music as a title for instrumental pieces, e.g. Robin Holloway's 1980 'aria' for chamber ensemble or Harrison Birtwistle's brass band piece, \"Grimethorpe Aria\" (1973).\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

Initially, Proto-Turkic speakers were potentially both hunter-gatherers and farmers; they later became nomadic pastoralists. Early and medieval Turkic groups exhibited a wide range of both East Asian and West-Eurasian physical appearances and genetic origins, in part through long-term contact with neighboring peoples such as Iranic, Mongolic, Tocharian, Uralic and Yeniseian peoples.\nMany vastly differing ethnic groups have throughout history become part of the Turkic peoples through language shift, acculturation, conquest, intermixing, adoption, and religious conversion. Nevertheless, Turkic peoples share, to varying degrees, non-linguistic characteristics like cultural traits, ancestry from a common gene pool, and historical experiences. Some of the most notable modern Turkic ethnic groups include the Altai people, Azerbaijanis, Chuvash people, Gagauz people, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz people, Turkmens, Turkish people, Tuvans, Uyghurs, Uzbeks, and Yakuts.\nEtymology.\nThe first known mention of the term \"Turk\" (Old Turkic: \ud803\udc45\ud803\udc07\ud803\udc3c\ud803\udc30 \"T\u00fcr\u00fck\" or \ud803\udc45\ud803\udc07\ud803\udc3c\ud803\udc30:\ud803\udc1c\ud803\udc07\ud803\udc1b \"K\u00f6k T\u00fcr\u00fck\", , Pinyin: T\u016bju\u00e9 &lt; Middle Chinese *\"t\u0266ut-kyat\" &lt; *\"dw\u0259t-ku\u0251t\", Old Tibetan: \"drugu\") applied to only one Turkic group, namely, the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks, who were also mentioned, as \"t\u00fcr\u00fcg\" ~ \"t\u00f6r\u00f6k\", in the 6th-century Kh\u00fcis Tolgoi inscription, most likely not later than 587 AD. A letter by Ishbara Qaghan to Emperor Wen of Sui in 585 described him as \"the Great Turk Khan\". The Bugut (584 CE) and Orkhon inscriptions (735 CE) use the terms \"T\u00fcrk\u00fct\", \"T\u00fcrk\" and \"T\u00fcr\u00fck\".\nDuring the first century CE, Pomponius Mela refers to the \"Turcae\" in the forests north of the Sea of Azov, and Pliny the Elder lists the \"Tyrcae\" among the people of the same area. However, English archaeologist Ellis Minns contended that \"Tyrcae\" \u03a4\u1fe6\u03c1\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 is \"a false correction\" for \"Iyrcae\" \u1f39\u03cd\u03c1\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9, a people who dwelt beyond the Thyssagetae, according to Herodotus (Histories, iv. 22), and were likely Ugric ancestors of Magyars. There are references to certain groups in antiquity whose names might have been foreign transcriptions of \"T\u00fcr(\u00fc)k\", such as \"Togarma\", \"Turukha\"/\"Turu\u0161ka\", \"Turukku\" and so on; but the information gap is so substantial that any connection of these ancient people to the modern Turks is not possible.\nThe Chinese \"Book of Zhou\" (7th century) presents an etymology of the name \"Turk\" as derived from 'helmet', explaining that this name comes from the shape of a mountain where they worked in the Altai Mountains. Hungarian scholar Andr\u00e1s R\u00f3na-Tas (1991) pointed to a Khotanese-Saka word, \"tturak\u00e4\" 'lid', semantically stretchable to 'helmet', as a possible source for this folk etymology, yet Golden thinks this connection requires more data.\nIt is generally accepted that the name \"T\u00fcrk\" is ultimately derived from the Old-Turkic migration-term \ud803\udc45\ud803\udc07\ud803\udc3c\ud803\udc30 \"T\u00fcr\u00fck\"/\"T\u00f6r\u00fck\", which means 'created, born' or 'strong'. Turkologist Peter B. Golden agrees that the term \"Turk\" has roots in Old Turkic, yet is not convinced by attempts to link \"Dili\", \"Dingling\", \"Chile\", \"Tele\", and \"Tiele\", which possibly transcribed *\"tegrek\" (probably meaning 'cart'), to \"Tujue\", which transliterated to \"T\u00fcrk\u00fct\".\nScholars, including Toru Haneda, Onogawa Hidemi, and Geng Shimin believed that \"Di\", \"Dili\", \"Dingling\", \"Chile\" and \"Tujue\" all came from the Turkic word \"T\u00fcrk\", which means 'powerful' and 'strength', and its plural form is \"T\u00fcrk\u00fct\". Even though Gerhard Doerfer supports the proposal that \"t\u00fcrk\" means 'strong' in general, Gerard Clauson points out that \"the word \"t\u00fcrk\" is never used in the generalized sense of 'strong'\" and that \"t\u00fcrk\" was originally a noun and meant \"'the culminating point of maturity' (of a fruit, human being, etc.), but more often used as an [adjective] meaning (of a fruit) 'just fully ripe'; (of a human being) 'in the prime of life, young, and vigorous'\". Hakan Aydemir (2022) also contends that \"T\u00fcrk\" originally did not mean \"strong, powerful\" but \"gathered; united, allied, confederated\" and was derived from the Pre-Proto-Turkic verb *\"t\u00fcr\u00fc\" \"heap up, collect, gather, assemble\".\nThe earliest Turkic-speaking peoples identifiable in Chinese sources are the Yenisei Kyrgyz and Xinli, located in South Siberia. Another example of an early Turkic population would be the Dingling.\nIn Late Antiquity itself, as well as in and the Middle Ages, the name \"Scythians\" was used in Greco-Roman and Byzantine literature for various groups of nomadic \"barbarians\" living on the Pontic-Caspian Steppe who were not related to the actual Scythians. Medieval European chroniclers subsumed various Turkic peoples of the Eurasian steppe as \"Scythians\". Between 400 CE and the 16th century, Byzantine sources use the name \u03a3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 (\"Skuthai\") in reference to twelve different Turkic peoples.\nIn the modern Turkish language as used in the Republic of Turkey, a distinction is made between \"Turks\" and the \"Turkic peoples\" in loosely speaking: the term \"T\u00fcrk\" corresponds specifically to the \"Turkish-speaking\" people (in this context, \"Turkish-speaking\" is considered the same as \"Turkic-speaking\"), while the term \"T\u00fcrki\" refers generally to the people of modern \"Turkic Republics\" (\"T\u00fcrki Cumhuriyetler\" or \"T\u00fcrk Cumhuriyetleri\"). However, the proper usage of the term is based on the linguistic classification in order to avoid any political sense. In short, the term \"T\u00fcrki\" can be used for \"T\u00fcrk\" or vice versa.\nList of ethnic groups.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPossible Proto-Turkic ancestry, at least partial, has been posited for Xiongnu, Huns and Pannonian Avars, as well as Tuoba and Rouran, who were of Proto-Mongolic Donghu ancestry. as well as Tatars, Rourans' supposed descendants.\nRemarks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLanguage.\nDistribution.\nThe Turkic languages constitute a language family of some 30 languages, spoken across a vast area from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, to Siberia and Manchuria and through to the Middle East. Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language; an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a second language. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is Turkish proper, or Anatolian Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers. More than one third of these are ethnic Turks of Turkey, dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly Ottoman-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and West Asia; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the Caucasus, China, and northern Iraq.\nThe Turkic language family was traditionally considered to be part of the proposed Altaic language family. Howeover since the 1950s, a majority of linguists have rejected the proposal, after supposed cognates were found not to be valid, hypothesized sound shifts were not found, and Turkic and Mongolic languages were found to be converging rather than diverging over the centuries. Opponents of the theory proposed that the similarities are due to mutual linguistic influences between the groups concerned.\nAlphabet.\nThe Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as runes), used for writing mostly Turkic languages. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in Mongolia. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.\nThe earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from the 8th century, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the Old Uyghur alphabet in the East and Central Asia, Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, Cyrillic in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and Latin alphabet in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of Turkic alphabet was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.\nThe Turkic runiform scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform palaeography as do, for example, the Gothic runiform scripts, noted for their exceptional uniformity of language and paleography. The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of which is the Orkhon version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks from the 8th century to record the Old Turkic language. It was later used by the Uyghur Empire; a Yenisei variant is known from 9th-century Kyrgyz inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the Talas Valley of Turkestan and the Old Hungarian script of the 10th century. Irk Bitig is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe origins of the Turkic peoples has been a topic of much discussion. Peter Benjamin Golden proposes two locations for the Proto-Turkic Urheimat: the southern Altai-Sayan region, and Southern Siberia, from Lake Baikal to eastern Mongolia. Other studies suggested an early presence of Turkic peoples in Mongolia, or Tuva.\nA possible genealogical link of the Turkic languages to Mongolic and Tungusic languages, specifically a hypothetical homeland in Manchuria, such as proposed in the Transeurasian hypothesis, by Martine Robbeets, has received support but also criticism, with opponents attributing similarities to long-term contact. The proto-Turkic-speakers may be linked to Neolithic East Asian agricultural societies in Northeastern China, which is to be associated with the Xinglongwa culture and the succeeding Hongshan culture, based on varying degrees of specific East Asian genetic substratum among modern Turkic speakers. According to historians, \"the Proto-Turkic subsistence strategy included an agricultural component, a tradition that ultimately went back to the origin of millet agriculture in Northeast China\". This view is however questioned by other geneticists, who found no evidence for a shared \"Neolithic Hongshan ancestry\", but in contrary primary Ancient Northeast Asian (ANA) Neolithic ancestry from the Amur region, supporting an origin from Northeast Asia rather than Manchuria.\nAround 2,200 BC, the (agricultural) ancestors of the Turkic peoples probably migrated westwards into Mongolia, where they adopted a pastoral lifestyle, in part borrowed from Iranian peoples. Given nomadic peoples such as Xiongnu, Rouran and Xianbei share underlying genetic ancestry \"that falls into or close to the northeast Asian gene pool\", the proto-Turkic language likely originated in northeastern Asia.\nGenetic data found that almost all modern Turkic peoples retained at least some shared ancestry associated with populations in \"South Siberia and Mongolia\" (SSM), supporting this region as the \"Inner Asian Homeland (IAH) of the pioneer carriers of Turkic languages\" which subsequently expanded into Central Asia. The main Turkic expansion took place during the 5th\u201316th centuries, partially overlapping with the Mongol Empire period. Based on single-path IBD tracts, the common Turkic ancestral population lived prior to these migration events, and likely stem from a similar source population as Mongolic peoples further East. Historical data suggests that the Mongol Empire period acted as secondary force of \"turkification\", as the Mongol conquest \"did not involve massive re-settlements of Mongols over the conquered territories. Instead, the Mongol war machine was progressively augmented by various Turkic tribes as they expanded, and in this way Turkic peoples eventually reinforced their expansion over the Eurasian steppe and beyond.\"\nThere is increasing evidence for a partial continuity from the eastern Scythians to the Turkic-speakers of the Altai region. Turkic-speaking Central Asians can be described as having formed from mixture between Scythian-like groups, displaying their highest genetic affinity to modern day Tajiks, and \"Eastern Steppe Xiongnu\" groups during the Iron Age.\nA 2018 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphism study suggested that the Eurasian Steppe slowly transitioned from Indo European and Iranian-speaking groups with largely western Eurasian ancestry to increasing East Asian ancestry with Turkic and Mongolian groups in the past 4000 years, including extensive Turkic migrations out of Mongolia and slow assimilation of local populations. A 2022 report suggested that Turkic and Mongolic populations in Central Asia formed via admixture events during the Iron Age between \"local Indo-Iranian and a South-Siberian or Mongolian group with a high East-Asian ancestry (around 60%)\". Modern day Turkmens form an outlier among Central Asian Turkic-speakers with a lower frequency of the Baikal component (c. 22%) and a lack of the Han-like component, being closer to other Indo-Iranian groups. A subsequent study in 2022 also found that the spread of Turkic-speaking populations into Central Asia happened after the spread of Indo-European speakers into the area. Another 2022 study found that all Altaic\u2010speaking (Turkic, Tungusic, and Mongolic) populations \"were a mixture of dominant Siberian Neolithic ancestry and non-negligible YRB ancestry\", suggesting their origins were somewhere in Northeast Asia, most likely the Amur river basin. Except Eastern and Southern Mongolic-speakers, all \"possessed a high proportion of West Eurasian-related ancestry, in accordance with the linguistically documented language borrowing in Turkic languages\".\nA 2023 study analyzed the DNA of Empress Ashina (568\u2013578 AD), a Royal G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk, whose remains were recovered from a mausoleum in Xianyang, China. The authors determined that Empress Ashina belonged to the North-East Asian mtDNA haplogroup F1d, and that approximately 96-98% of her autosomal ancestry was of Ancient Northeast Asian origin, while roughly 2-4% was of West Eurasian origin, indicating ancient admixture. This study weakened the \"western Eurasian origin and multiple origin hypotheses\". However, they also noted that \"Central Steppe and early Medieval T\u00fcrk exhibited a high but variable degree of West Eurasian ancestry, indicating there was a genetic substructure of the T\u00fcrkic empire.\" The early medieval T\u00fcrk samples were modelled as having 37.8% West Eurasian ancestry and 62.2% Ancient Northeast Asian ancestry and historic Central Steppe T\u00fcrk samples were also an admixture of West Eurasian and Ancient Northeast Asian ancestry, while historic Karakhanid, Kipchak and the Turkic Karluk samples had 50.6%-61.1% West Eurasian ancestry and 38.9%\u201349.4% Iron Age Yellow River farmer ancestry. A 2020 study also found \"high genetic heterogeneity and diversity during the T\u00fcrkic and Uyghur periods\" in the early medieval period in Eastern Eurasian Steppe.\nEarly historical attestation.\nThe earliest separate Turkic peoples, such as the \"Gekun\" (\u9b32\u6606) and \"Xinli\" (\u85aa\u7281), appeared on the peripheries of the late Xiongnu confederation about 200 BCE (contemporaneous with the Chinese Han dynasty) and later among the Turkic-speaking Tiele as \"Hegu\" (\u7d07\u9aa8) and \"Xue\" (\u859b).\nThe Tiele (also known as Gaoche \u9ad8\u8eca, lit. \"High Carts\"), may be related to the Xiongnu and the Dingling. According to the \"Book of Wei\", the Tiele people were the remnants of the Chidi (\u8d64\u72c4), the red Di people competing with the Jin in the Spring and Autumn period. Historically they were established after the 6th century BCE.\nThe Tiele were first mentioned in Chinese literature from the 6th to 8th centuries. Some scholars (Haneda, Onogawa, Geng, etc.) proposed that \"Tiele\", \"Dili\", \"Dingling\", \"Chile\", \"Tele\", &amp; \"Tujue\" all transliterated underlying \"T\u00fcrk\"; however, Golden proposed that \"Dili\", \"Dingling\", \"Chile\", \"Tele\", and \"Tiele\" transliterated \"Tegrek\" while Tujue transliterated \"T\u00fcrk\u00fct\", plural of \"T\u00fcrk\". The appellation \"T\u00fcr\u00fck\" (Old Turkic: \ud803\udc45\ud803\udc07\ud803\udc3c\ud803\udc30) ~ \"T\u00fcrk\" (OT: \ud803\udc45\ud803\udc07\ud803\udc3c\ud803\udc1a) (whence Middle Chinese \u7a81\u53a5 *\"dw\u0259t-ku\u0251t\" &gt; *\"t\u0266ut-kyat\" &gt; standard Chinese: \"T\u016bju\u00e9\") was initially reserved exclusively for the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks by Chinese, Tibetans, and even the Turkic-speaking Uyghurs. In contrast, medieval Muslim writers, including Turkic speakers like Ottoman historian Mustafa \u00c2l\u00ee and explorer Evliya \u00c7elebi as well as Timurid scientist Ulugh Beg, often viewed Inner Asian tribes, \"as forming a single entity regardless of their linguistic affiliation\" commonly used Turk as a generic name for Inner Asians (whether Turkic- or Mongolic-speaking). Only in modern era do modern historians use Turks to refer to all peoples speaking Turkic languages, differentiated from non-Turkic speakers.\nAccording to some researchers (Duan, Xue, Tang, Lung, Onogawa, etc.) the later Ashina tribe descended from the Tiele confederation. The Tiele however were probably one of many early Turkic groups, ancestral to later Turkic populations. However, according to Lee &amp; Kuang (2017), Chinese histories do not describe the Ashina and the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks as descending from the Dingling or the Tiele confederation.\nXiongnu (3rd c. BCE \u2013 1st c. CE).\nIt has even been suggested that the Xiongnu themselves, who were mentioned in Han dynasty records, were Proto-Turkic speakers. The Turks may ultimately have been of Xiongnu descent. Although little is known for certain about the Xiongnu language(s), it seems likely that at least a considerable part of Xiongnu tribes spoke a Turkic language. Some scholars believe they were probably a confederation of various ethnic and linguistic groups. According to a study by Alexander Savelyev and Choongwon Jeong, published in 2020 in the journal \"Evolutionary Human Sciences\" by Cambridge University Press, \"the predominant part of the Xiongnu population is likely to have spoken Turkic\". However, genetic studies found a mixture of western and eastern Eurasian ancestries, suggesting a large genetic diversity within the Xiongnu. The Turkic-related component may be brought by eastern Eurasian genetic substratum.\nUsing the only extant possibly Xiongnu writings, the rock art of the Yinshan and Helan Mountains, some scholars argue that the older Xiongnu writings are precursors to the earliest known Turkic alphabet, the Orkhon script. Petroglyphs of this region dates from the 9th millennium BCE to the 19th century, and consists mainly of engraved signs (petroglyphs) and few painted images. Excavations done during 1924\u20131925 in Noin-Ula kurgans located in the Selenga River in the northern Mongolian hills north of Ulaanbaatar produced objects with over 20 carved characters, which were either identical or very similar to the runic letters of the Turkic Orkhon script discovered in the Orkhon Valley.\nSteppe expansions.\nG\u00f6kt\u00fcrks \u2013 Turkic Khaganate (5th\u20138th c.).\nThe earliest certain mentioning of the politonym \"Turk\" was in the Chinese Book of Zhou. In the 540s AD, this text mentions that the Turks came to China's border seeking silk goods and a trade relationship. A Sogdian diplomat represented China in a series of embassies between the Western Wei dynasty and the Turks in the years 545 and 546.\nAccording to the \"Book of Sui\" and the \"Tongdian\", they were \"mixed barbarians\" (\u96dc\u80e1; \"z\u00e1h\u00fa\") who migrated from Pingliang (now in modern Gansu province, China) to the Rourans seeking inclusion in their confederacy and protection from the prevailing dynasty. Alternatively, according to the \"Book of Zhou\", \"History of the Northern Dynasties\", and \"New Book of Tang\", the Ashina clan was a component of the Xiongnu confederation. G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks were also posited as having originated from an obscure Suo state (\u7d22\u570b), north of the Xiongnu. The Ashina tribe were famed metalsmiths and were granted land south of the Altai Mountains (\u91d1\u5c71 \"Jinshan\"), which looked like a helmet, from which they were said to have gotten their name \u7a81\u53a5 (\"T\u016bju\u00e9\"), the first recorded use of \"Turk\" as a political name. In the 6th-century, Ashina's power had increased such that they conquered the Tiele on their Rouran overlords' behalf and even overthrew Rourans and established the First Turkic Khaganate.\nThe original Old Turkic name \"K\u00f6k T\u00fcrk\" derives from \"k\u00f6k\" ~ \"k\u00f6:k\", \"sky, sky-coloured, blue, blue-grey\". Unlike its Xiongnu predecessor, the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk Khaganate had its temporary Khagans from the Ashina clan, who were \"subordinate\" to a sovereign authority controlled by a council of tribal chiefs. The Khaganate retained elements of its original animistic- shamanistic religion, that later evolved into Tengriism, although it received missionaries of Buddhist monks and practiced a syncretic religion. The G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks were the first Turkic people to write Old Turkic in a runic script, the Orkhon script. The Khaganate was also the first state known as \"Turk\". It eventually collapsed due to a series of dynastic conflicts, but many states and peoples later used the name \"Turk\".\nThe G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks (First Turkic Kaganate) quickly spread west to the Caspian Sea. Between 581 and 603 the Western Turkic Khaganate in Kazakhstan separated from the Eastern Turkic Khaganate in Mongolia and Manchuria during a civil war. The Han-Chinese successfully overthrew the Eastern Turks in 630 and created a military Protectorate until 682. After that time the Second Turkic Khaganate ruled large parts of the former G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk area. After several wars between Turks, Chinese and Tibetans, the weakened Second Turkic Khaganate was replaced by the Uyghur Khaganate in the year 744.\nBulgars, Golden Horde and the Siberian Khanate.\nThe Bulgars established themselves in between the Caspian and Black Seas in the 5th and 6th centuries, followed by their conquerors, the Khazars who converted to Judaism in the 8th or 9th century. After them came the Pechenegs who created a large confederacy, which was subsequently taken over by the Cumans and the Kipchaks. One group of Bulgars settled in the Volga region and mixed with local Volga Finns to become the Volga Bulgars in what is today Tatarstan. These Bulgars were conquered by the Mongols following their westward sweep under Ogedei Khan in the 13th century. Other Bulgars settled in Southeastern Europe in the 7th and 8th centuries, and mixed with the Slavic population, adopting what eventually became the Slavic Bulgarian language. Everywhere, Turkic groups mixed with the local populations to varying degrees.\nThe Volga Bulgaria became an Islamic state in 922 and influenced the region as it controlled many trade routes. In the 13th century, Mongols invaded Europe and established the Golden Horde in Eastern Europe, western and northern Central Asia, and even western Siberia. The Cuman-Kipchak Confederation and Islamic Volga Bulgaria were absorbed by the Golden Horde in the 13th century; in the 14th century, Islam became the official religion under Uzbeg Khan where the general population (Turks) as well as the aristocracy (Mongols) came to speak the Kipchak language and were collectively known as \"Tatars\" by Russians and Westerners. This country was also known as the Kipchak Khanate and covered most of what is today Ukraine, as well as the entirety of modern-day southern and eastern Russia (the European section). The Golden Horde disintegrated into several khanates and hordes in the 15th and 16th century including the Crimean Khanate, Khanate of Kazan, and Kazakh Khanate (among others), which were one by one conquered and annexed by the Russian Empire in the 16th through 19th centuries.\nIn Siberia, the Siberian Khanate was established in the 1490s by fleeing Tatar aristocrats of the disintegrating Golden Horde who established Islam as the official religion in western Siberia over the partly Islamized native Siberian Tatars and indigenous Uralic peoples. It was the northernmost Islamic state in recorded history and it survived up until 1598 when it was conquered by Russia.\nUyghur Khaganate (8th\u20139th c.).\nThe Uyghur Khaganate had established itself by the year 744 AD. Through trade relations established with China, its capital city of Ordu Baliq in central Mongolia's Orkhon Valley became a wealthy center of commerce, and a significant portion of the Uyghur population abandoned their nomadic lifestyle for a sedentary one. The Uyghur Khaganate produced extensive literature, and a relatively high number of its inhabitants were literate.\nThe official state religion of the early Uyghur Khaganate was Manichaeism, which was introduced through the conversion of B\u00f6g\u00fc Qaghan by the Sogdians after the An Lushan rebellion. The Uyghur Khaganate was tolerant of religious diversity and practiced variety of religions including Buddhism, Christianity, shamanism and Manichaeism.\nDuring the same time period, the Shatuo Turks emerged as power factor in Northern and Central China and were recognized by the Tang Empire as allied power.\nIn 808, 30,000 Shatuo under Zhuye Jinzhong defected from the Tibetans to Tang China and the Tibetans punished them by killing Zhuye Jinzhong as they were chasing them. The Uyghurs also fought against an alliance of Shatuo and Tibetans at Beshbalik.\nThe Shatuo Turks under Zhuye Chixin (Li Guochang) served the Tang dynasty in fighting against their fellow Turkic people in the Uyghur Khaganate. In 839, when the Uyghur khaganate (Huigu) general Jueluowu (\u6398\u7f85\u52ff) rose against the rule of then-reigning Zhangxin Khan, he elicited the help from Zhuye Chixin by giving Zhuye 300 horses, and together, they defeated Zhangxin Khan, who then committed suicide, precipitating the subsequent collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate. In the next few years, when Uyghur Khaganate remnants tried to raid Tang borders, the Shatuo participated extensively in counterattacking the Uyghur Khaganate with other tribes loyal to Tang. In 843, Zhuye Chixin, under the command of the Han Chinese officer Shi Xiong with Tuyuhun, Tangut and Han Chinese troops, participated in a raid against the Uyghur khaganate that led to the slaughter of Uyghur forces at Shahu mountain.\nThe Shatuo Turks had founded several short-lived sinicized dynasties in northern China during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period starting with Later Tang. The Shatuo chief Zhuye Chixin's family was adopted by the Tang dynasty and given the title prince of Jin and the Tang dynasty imperial surname of Li, which is why the Shatuo of Later Tang claimed to be restoring the Tang dynasty and not founding a new one. The official language of these dynasties was Chinese and they used Chinese titles and names. Some Shaotuo Turk emperors (of the Later Jin, Later Han and Northern Han) also claimed patrilineal Han Chinese ancestry.\nAfter the fall of the Tang dynasty in 907, the Shatuo Turks replaced them and created the Later Tang dynasty in 923. The Shatuo Turks ruled over a large part of northern China, including Beijing. They adopted Chinese names and united Turkic and Chinese traditions. Later Tang fell in 937 but the Shatuo rose to become a powerful faction of northern China. They created two other dynasties, including the Later Jin and Later Han and Northern Han (Later Han and Northern Han were ruled by the same family, with the latter being a rump state of the former). The Shatuo Liu Zhiyuan was a Buddhist and he worshipped the Mengshan Giant Buddha in 945. The Shatuo dynasties were replaced by the Han Chinese Song dynasty. The Shatuo became the Ongud Turks living in Inner Mongolia after the Song dynasty conquered the last Shatuo dynasty of Northern Han. The Ongud assimilated to the Mongols.\nThe Yenisei Kyrgyz allied with China to destroy the Uyghur Khaganate in the year 840 AD. From the Yenisei River, the Kyrgyz pushed south and eastward in to Xinjiang and the Orkhon Valley in central Mongolia, leaving much of the Uyghur civilization in ruins. Much of the Uyghur population relocated to the southwest of Mongolia, establishing the Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom in Gansu where their descendants are the modern day Yugurs and Qocho Kingdom in Turpan, Xinjiang.\nCentral Asia.\nKangar union (659\u2013750).\nThe Kangar Union (\"Qanghar Odaghu\") was a Turkic state in the former territory of the Western Turkic Khaganate (the entire present-day state of Kazakhstan, without Zhetysu). The capital of the Kangar union was located in the Ulytau mountains. Among the Pechenegs, the Kangar formed the elite of the Pecheneg tribes. After being defeated by the Kipchaks, Oghuz Turks, and the Khazars, they migrated west and defeated Magyars, and after forming an alliance with the Bulgars, they defeated the Byzantine Army. The Pecheneg state was established by the 11th century and at its peak carried a population of over 2.5 million, composed of many different ethnic groups.\nThe elite of the Kangar tribes are believed to have had an Iranian origin, and they likely spoke an Iranian language, while most of the Pecheneg population spoke a Turkic language, with a significant percentage speaking Hunno-Bulgar dialects.\nThe Yatuks, a tribe within the Kangar state who could not accompany the Kangars as they migrated West, remained in the old lands, where they are known as the Kangly people, who are now part of the Uzbek, Kazakh, and Karakalpak tribes.\nOghuz Yabgu State (766\u20131055).\nThe Oguz Yabgu State (\"Oguz il\", meaning \"Oguz Land\", \"Oguz Country\")(750\u20131055) was a Turkic state, founded by Oghuz Turks in 766, located geographically in an area between the coasts of the Caspian and Aral Seas. Oguz tribes occupied a vast territory in Kazakhstan along the Irgiz, Yaik, Emba, and Uil rivers, the Aral Sea area, the Syr Darya valley, the foothills of the Karatau Mountains in Tien-Shan, and the Chui River valley (see map). The Oguz political association developed in the 9th and 10th centuries in the Syr Darya basin.\nSalar Oghuz migration.\nThe Salars are descended from Turkmen who migrated from Central Asia and settled in a Tibetan area of Qinghai under Ming Chinese rule. The Salar ethnicity formed and underwent ethnogenesis from a process of male Turkmen migrants from Central Asia marrying Amdo Tibetan women during the early Ming dynasty.\nIranian, Indian, Arabic, and Anatolian expansion.\nTurkic peoples and related groups migrated west from present-day Northeastern China, Mongolia, Siberia and the Turkestan-region towards the Iranian plateau, South Asia, and Anatolia (modern Turkey) in many waves. The date of the initial expansion remains unknown.\nPersia.\nGhaznavid dynasty (977\u20131186).\nThe Ghaznavid dynasty ( \"\u0121aznaviy\u0101n\") was a Persianate Muslim dynasty of Turkic \"mamluk\" origin, at their greatest extent ruling large parts of Iran, Afghanistan, much of Transoxiana and the northwest Indian subcontinent (part of Pakistan) from 977 to 1186. The dynasty was founded by Sabuktigin upon his succession to rule of the region of Ghazna after the death of his father-in-law, Alp Tigin, who was a breakaway ex-general of the Samanid Empire from Balkh, north of the Hindu Kush in Greater Khorasan.\nAlthough the dynasty was of Central Asian Turkic origin, it was thoroughly Persianised in terms of language, culture, literature and habits and hence is regarded by some as a \"Persian dynasty\".\nSeljuk Empire (1037\u20131194).\nThe Seljuk Empire () or the Great Seljuq Empire was a high medieval Turko-Persian Sunni Muslim empire, originating from the Qiniq branch of Oghuz Turks. At its greatest extent, the Seljuk Empire controlled a vast area stretching from western Anatolia and the Levant to the Hindu Kush in the east, and from Central Asia to the Persian Gulf in the south.\nThe Seljuk empire was founded by Tughril Beg (1016\u20131063) and his brother Chaghri Beg (989\u20131060) in 1037. From their homelands near the Aral Sea, the Seljuks advanced first into Khorasan and then into mainland Persia, before eventually conquering eastern Anatolia. Here the Seljuks won the battle of Manzikert in 1071 and conquered most of Anatolia from the Byzantine Empire, which became one of the reasons for the First Crusade (1095\u20131099). From c. 1150\u20131250, the Seljuk empire declined, and was invaded by the Mongols around 1260. The Mongols divided Anatolia into emirates. Eventually one of these, the Ottoman, would conquer the rest.\nTimurid Empire (1370\u20131507).\nThe Timurid Empire was a Turko-Mongol empire founded in the late 14th century through military conquests led by Timurlane. The establishment of a cosmopolitan empire was followed by the Timurid Renaissance, a period of local enrichment in mathematics, astronomy, architecture, as well as newfound economic growth. The cultural progress of the Timurid period ended as soon as the empire collapsed in the early 16th century, leaving many intellecuals and artists to turn elsewhere in search of employment.\nCentral Asian khanates (1501\u20131920).\nThe Bukhara Khanate was an Uzbek state that existed from 1501 to 1785. The khanate was ruled by three dynasties of the Shaybanids, Janids and the Uzbek dynasty of Mangits. In 1785, Shahmurad, formalized the family's dynastic rule (Manghit dynasty), and the khanate became the Emirate of Bukhara (1785\u20131920). In 1710, the Kokand Khanate (1710\u20131876) separated from the Bukhara Khanate. In 1511\u20131920, Khwarazm (Khiva Khanate) was ruled by the Arabshahid dynasty and the Uzbek dynasty of Kungrats.\nAfsharid dynasty (1736\u20131796).\nThe Afsharid dynasty was named after the Turkic Afshar tribe to which they belonged. The Afshars had migrated from Turkestan to Azerbaijan in the 13th century. The dynasty was founded in 1736 by the military commander Nader Shah who deposed the last member of the Safavid dynasty and proclaimed himself King of Iran. Nader belonged to the Qereqlu branch of the Afshars. During Nader's reign, Iran reached its greatest extent since the Sassanid Empire.\nQajar dynasty (1789\u20131925).\nThe Qajar dynasty was created by the Turkic Qajar tribe, ruling over Iran from 1789 to 1925. The Qajar family took full control of Iran in 1794, deposing Lotf 'Ali Khan, the last Shah of the Zand dynasty, and re-asserted Iranian sovereignty over large parts of the Caucasus. In 1796, Mohammad Khan Qajar seized Mashhad with ease, putting an end to the Afsharid dynasty, and Mohammad Khan was formally crowned as Shah after his punitive campaign against Iran's Georgian subjects. In the Caucasus, the Qajar dynasty permanently lost many of Iran's integral areas to the Russians over the course of the 19th century, comprising modern-day Georgia, Dagestan, Azerbaijan and Armenia. The dynasty was founded by Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar and continued until Ahmad Shah Qajar.\nSouth Asia.\nThe Delhi Sultanate is a term used to cover five short-lived, Delhi-based kingdoms, two of which were of Turkic origins: the Mamluk dynasty (1206\u20131290) and the Tughlaq dynasty (1320\u20131414). Southern India saw rise of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, one of the Deccan sultanates.\nThe Mughal Empire was a Turko-Mongol empire that, at its greatest territorial extent, ruled most of South Asia, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and parts of Uzbekistan from the early 16th to the early 18th centuries. The Mughal dynasty was founded by a Turko-Mongol prince named Babur (reigned 1526\u20131530), who was descended from Timur (Tamerlane) on his father's side and from Chagatai, second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother's side. A further distinction was the attempt of the Mughals to integrate Hindus and Muslims into a united Indian state.\nArab world.\nThe Arab Muslim Umayyads and Abbasids fought against the pagan Turks in the T\u00fcrgesh Khaganate in the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana. Turkic soldiers in the army of the Abbasid caliphs emerged as the de facto rulers of most of the Muslim Middle East (apart from Syria and Egypt), particularly after the 10th century. Examples of regional de facto independent states include the short lived Tulunids and Ikhshidids in Egypt. The Oghuz and other tribes captured and dominated various countries under the leadership of the Seljuk dynasty and eventually captured the territories of the Abbasid dynasty and the Byzantine Empire.\nAnatolia \u2013 Ottomans.\nAfter many battles, the western Oghuz Turks established their own state and later constructed the Ottoman Empire. The main migration of the Oghuz Turks occurred in medieval times, when they spread across most of Asia and into Europe and the Middle East. They also took part in the military encounters of the Crusades. In 1090\u201391, the Turkic Pechenegs reached the walls of Constantinople, where Emperor Alexius I with the aid of the Kipchaks annihilated their army.\nAs the Seljuk Empire declined following the Mongol invasion, the Ottoman Empire emerged as the new important Turkic state, that came to dominate not only the Middle East, but even southeastern Europe, parts of southwestern Russia, and northern Africa.\nIslamization.\nTurkic peoples like the Karluks (mainly 8th century), Uyghurs, Kyrgyz, Turkmens, and Kipchaks later came into contact with Muslims, and most of them gradually adopted Islam. Some groups of Turkic people practice other religions, including their original animistic-shamanistic religion, Christianity, Burkhanism, Judaism (Khazars, Krymchaks, Crimean Karaites), Buddhism, and a small number of Zoroastrians.\nModern history.\nThe Ottoman Empire gradually grew weaker in the face of poor administration, repeated wars with Russia, Austria and Hungary, and the emergence of nationalist movements in the Balkans, and it finally gave way after World War I to the present-day Republic of Turkey.\nEthnic nationalism also developed in Ottoman Empire during the 19th century, taking the form of Pan-Turkism or Turanism.\nThe Turkic peoples of Central Asia were not organized in nation-states during most of the 20th century, after the collapse of the Russian Empire living either in the Soviet Union or (after a short-lived First East Turkestan Republic) in the Chinese Republic. For much of the 20th century, Turkey was the only independent Turkic country.\nIn 1991, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, five Turkic states gained their independence. These were Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Other Turkic regions such as Tatarstan, Tuva, and Yakutia remained in the Russian Federation. Chinese Turkestan remained part of the People's Republic of China. Immediately after the independence of the Turkic states, Turkey began seeking diplomatic relations with them. Over time political meetings between the Turkic countries increased and led to the establishment of T\u00dcRKSOY in 1993 and the Turkic Council in 2009, which later was renamed Organization of Turkic States in 2021.\nPhysiognomy.\nAccording to historians Joo-Yup Lee and Shuntu Kuang, Chinese official histories do not depict Turkic peoples as belonging to a single uniform entity called \"Turks\". However \"Chinese histories also depict the Turkic-speaking peoples as typically possessing East/Inner Asian physiognomy, as well as occasionally having West Eurasian physiognomy.\" According to \"fragmentary information on the Xiongnu language that can be found in the Chinese histories, the Xiongnu were Turkic\", however historians have been unable to confirm whether or not they were Turkic. Sima Qian's description of their legendary origins suggest their physiognomy was \"not too different from that of... Han (\u6f22) Chinese population\", but a subset of Xiongnu known as the Jie people were described having \"deep-set eyes\", \"high nose bridges\" and \"heavy facial hair\". The Jie may have been Yeniseian, although others maintaining an Iranian affiliation, and regardless of whether or not the Xiongnu were Turkic, they were a hybrid people. According to the \"Old Book of Tang\", Ashina Simo \"was not given a high military post by the Ashina rulers because of his Sogdian (\"huren\" \u80e1\u4eba) physiognomy.\" The Tang historian Yan Shigu described the Hu people of his day as \"blue-eyed and red bearded\" descendants of the Wusun, whereas \"no comparable depiction of the K\u00f6k T\u00fcrks or Tiele is found in the official Chinese histories.\"\nHistorian Peter Golden has reported that genetic testing of the proposed descendants of the Ashina tribe does seem to confirm a link to the Indo-Iranians, emphasizing that \"\"the Turks as a whole 'were made up of heterogeneous and somatically dissimilar populations\"'\". Historian and Professor Xue Zongzheng have argued that West Eurasian features were typical of the royal Ashina clan of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate and that their appearance shifted to an East Asian one due to intermarriage with foreign nobility. As a result, by the time of Kul Tigin (684 AD), members of the Ashina dynasty had East Asian features. A 2023 genetic study found that Empress Ashina (568\u2013578 AD), a Royal G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk, had nearly entirely Ancient Northeast Asian origin, weakening the \"western Eurasian origin and multiple origin hypotheses\". Lee and Kuang believe it is likely \"early and medieval Turkic peoples themselves did not form a homogeneous entity and that some of them, non-Turkic by origin, had become Turkicised at some point in history.\" They also suggest that many modern Turkic-speaking populations are not directly descended from early Turkic peoples. Lee and Kuang concluded that \"both medieval Chinese histories and modern DNA studies point to the fact that the early and medieval Turkic peoples were made up of heterogeneous and somatically dissimilar populations.\"\nLike Chinese historians, Medieval Muslim writers generally depicted the Turks as having an East Asian appearance. Unlike Chinese historians, Medieval Muslim writers used the term \"Turk\" broadly to refer to not only Turkic-speaking peoples but also various non-Turkic speaking peoples, such as the Hephthalites, Rus, Magyars, and Tibetans. In the 13th century, Juzjani referred to the people of Tibet and the mountains between Tibet and Bengal as \"Turks\" and \"people with Turkish features.\" Medieval Arab and Persian descriptions of Turks state that they looked strange from their perspective and were extremely physically different from Arabs. Turks were described as \"broad faced people with small eyes\", having light-colored, often reddish hair, and with pink skin, as being \"short, with small eyes, nostrils, and mouths\" (Sharaf al-Zaman al-Marwazi), as being \"full-faced with small eyes\" (Al-Tabari), as possessing \"a large head (\"sar-i buzurg\"), a broad face (\"r\u016by-i pahn\"), narrow eyes (\"chashmh\u0101-i tang\"), and a flat nose (\"b\u012bn\u012b-i pakhch\"), and unpleasing lips and teeth (\"lab va dand\u0101n na n\u012bk\u016b\")\" (Keikavus). On Western Turkic coins \"the faces of the governor and governess are clearly Mongoloid (a roundish face, narrow eyes), and the portrait have definite old T\u00fcrk features (long hair, absence of headdress of the governor, a tricorn headdress of the governess)\". In the Ghaznavids' residential palace of Lashkari Bazar, there survives a partially conserved portrait depicting a turbaned and haloed adolescent figure with full cheeks, slanted eyes, and a small, sinuous mouth. The Armenian historian Movses Kaghankatvatsi describes the Turks of the Western Turkic Khaganate as \"broad-faced, without eyelashes, and with long flowing hair like women\".\nAl-Masudi writes that the Oghuz Turks in Yengi-kent near the mouth of the Syr Darya \"are distinguished from other Turks by their valour, their slanted eyes, and the smallness of their stature.\" Later Muslim writers noted a change in the physiognomy of Oghuz Turks. According to Rashid al-Din Hamadani, \"because of the climate their features gradually changed into those of Tajiks. Since they were not Tajiks, the Tajik peoples called them \"turkm\u0101n\", i.e. Turk-like (\"Turk-m\u0101nand\").\" \u1e24\u0101fi\u1e93 Tan\u012bsh M\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad Bukh\u0101r\u012b also related that the Oghuz' 'Turkic face did not remain as it was' after their migration into Transoxiana and Iran. Khiva khan Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur wrote in his Chagatai language treatise \"Shajara-i Tar\u0101kima\" (Genealogy of the Turkmens) that \"their chin started to become narrow, their eyes started to become large, their faces started to become small, and their noses started to become big' after five or six generations\". Ottoman historian Mustafa \u00c2l\u00ee commented in \"K\u00fcnh\u00fc\u02bel-a\u1e2bb\u0101r\" that Anatolian Turks and Ottoman elites are ethnically mixed: \"Most of the inhabitants of R\u00fbm are of confused ethnic origin. Among its notables there are few whose lineage does not go back to a convert to Islam.\"\nKevin Alan Brook states that like \"most nomadic Turks, the Western Turkic Khazars were racially and ethnically mixed.\" Istakhri described Khazars as having black hair while Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi described them as having blue eyes, light skin, and reddish hair. Istakhri mentions that there were \"Black Khazars\" and \"White Khazars.\" Most scholars believe these were political designations: black being lower class while white being higher class. Constantin Zuckerman argues that these \"had physical and racial differences and explained that they stemmed from the merger of the Khazars with the Barsils.\" Old East Slavic sources called the Khazars the \"White Ugry\" and the Magyars the \"Black Ugry.\" Soviet excavated Khazar remains show Slavic-type, European-type, and a minority Mongoloid-type skulls.\nThe Yenisei Kyrgyz are mentioned in the \"New Book of Tang\" as having the same script and language as the Uyghurs but \"The people are all tall and\nbig and have red hair, white faces, and green eyes.\" The \"New Book of Tang\" also states that the neighboring Boma tribe resembled the Kyrgyz but their language was different, which may imply the Kyrgyz were originally a non-Turkic people, who were later Turkicized through inter-tribal marriages. According to Gardizi, the Kyrgyz were mixed with \"Saqlabs\" (Slavs), which explains the red hair and white skin among the Kyrgyz, while the \"New Book\" states that the Kyrgyz \"intermixed with the Dingling.\" The Kyrgyz \"regarded those with black eyes as descending from [Li] Ling,\" a Han dynasty general who defected to the Xiongnu.\nIn a Chinese legal statute from the early period of the Ming dynasty, the Kipchaks are described as having blond hair and blue eyes. It also states that they had a \"vile\" and \"peculiar\" appearance, and that some Chinese people would not want to marry them. Russian anthropologist Oshanin (1964: 24, 32) notes that \"the 'Mongoloid' phenotype, characteristic of modern Kazakhs and Qirghiz, prevails among the skulls of the Qipchaq and Pecheneg nomads found in the kurgans in eastern Ukraine\"; Lee &amp; Kuang (2017) propose that Oshanin's discovery is explainable by assuming that the historical Kipchaks' modern descendants are Kazakhs of the Lesser Horde, whose men possess a high frequency of haplogroup C2's subclade C2b1b1 (59.7 to 78%). Lee and Kuang also suggest that the high frequency (63.9%) of the Y-DNA haplogroup R-M73 among Karakypshaks (a tribe within the Kipchaks) allows inference about the genetics of Karakypshaks' medieval ancestors, thus explaining why some medieval Kipchaks were described as possessing \"blue [or green] eyes and red hair.\nByzantine historians of the 11th-12th centuries provided description of Turkmens as very different from the Greeks. Bertrandon de la Broqui\u00e8re, a French traveller to the Ottoman Empire, met with sultan Murad II in Adrianople, and described him in the following terms: \"In the first place, as I have seen him frequently, I shall say that he is a little, short, thick man, with the physiognomy of a Tartar. He has a broad and brown face, high cheek bones, a round beard, a great and crooked nose, with little eyes\".\nRemarks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nInternational organizations.\nThere are several international organizations created with the purpose of furthering cooperation between countries with Turkic-speaking populations, such as the Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture (T\u00dcRKSOY) and the Parliamentary Assembly of Turkic-speaking Countries (T\u00dcRKPA) and the Turkic Council.\nThe TAKM \u2013 Organization of the Eurasian Law Enforcement Agencies with Military Status, was established on 25 January 2013. It is an intergovernmental military law enforcement (gendarmerie) organization of currently three Turkic countries (Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey) and Kazakhstan as observer.\nT\u00dcRKSOY.\nT\u00fcrksoy carries out activities to strengthen cultural ties between Turkic peoples. One of the main goals to transmit their common cultural heritage to future generations and promote it around the world.\nEvery year, one city in the Turkic world is selected as the \"Cultural Capital of the Turkic World\". Within the framework of events to celebrate the Cultural Capital of the Turkic World, numerous cultural events are held, gathering artists, scholars and intellectuals, giving them the opportunity to exchange their experiences, as well as promoting the city in question internationally.\nOrganization of Turkic States.\nThe Organization of Turkic States, founded on 3 November 2009, by the \"Nakhchivan Agreement\" confederation, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey, aims to integrate these organizations into a tighter geopolitical framework.\nThe member countries are Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey and Uzbekistan. The idea of setting up this cooperative council was first put forward by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev back in 2006. Hungary has announced to be interested in joining the Organization of Turkic States. Since August 2018, Hungary has official observer status in the Organization of Turkic States. Turkmenistan also joined as an observer state to the organization at 8th summit. Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus was admitted to the organization as observer member at the 2022 Samarkand Summit.\nDemographics.\nThe distribution of people of Turkic cultural background ranges from Siberia, across Central Asia, to Southern Europe. As of 2011[ [update]] the largest groups of Turkic people live throughout Central Asia\u2014Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Azerbaijan, in addition to Turkey and Iran. Additionally, Turkic people are found within Crimea, Altishahr region of western China, northern Iraq, Israel, Russia, Afghanistan, Cyprus, and the Balkans: Moldova, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and former Yugoslavia.\nA small number of Turkic people also live in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. Small numbers inhabit eastern Poland and the south-eastern part of Finland. There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from Turkey) in Germany, United States, and Australia, largely because of migrations during the 20th century.\nSometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the Oghuz Turks, Kipchak, Karluk, Siberian, Chuvash, and Sakha/Yakut branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.\nThe genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins. The Karakalpaks have a somewhat greater bias towards the eastern markers than the Uzbeks.\nHistorical population:\nThe following incomplete list of Turkic people shows the respective groups' core areas of settlement and their estimated sizes (in millions):\nCuisine.\nMarkets in the steppe region had a limited range of foodstuffs available\u2014mostly grains, dried fruits, spices, and tea. Turks mostly herded sheep, goats and horses. Dairy was a staple of the nomadic diet and there are many Turkic words for various dairy products such as \"s\u00fct\" (milk), \"yagh\" (butter), ayran, \"qaymaq\" (similar to clotted cream), qi\u0305mi\u0305z (fermented mare's milk) and \"qurut\" (dried yoghurt). During the Middle Ages Kazakh, Kyrgyz and Tatars, who were historically part of the Turkic nomadic group known as the Golden Horde, continued to develop new variations of dairy products.\nNomadic Turks cooked their meals in a \"qazan\", a pot similar to a cauldron; a wooden rack called a \"qasqan\" can be used to prepare certain steamed foods, like the traditional meat dumplings called \"manti\". They also used a \"saj\", a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and \"shish\". In later times, the Persian tava was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a \"chanaq\", and eaten with a knife (\"b\u00efchaq\") and spoon (\"qashi\u0305q\"). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called \"oqlaghu\", a colander called \"s\u00fczgu\u0305\u00e7h\", and a grinding stone called \"t\u0101girm\u0101n\".\nMedieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called \"qaw\u00efrmach\", while \"k\u00f6ch\u00e4\" was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. \"Salma\" were broad noodles that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called \"tutmaj\" in the Middle Ages and are called \"kesme\" today.\nThere are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. \"Yupqa\" is the thinnest type of dough, \"bawi\u0305rsaq\" is a type of fried bread dough, and \"ch\u00e4lp\u00e4k\" is a deep-fried flat bread. \"Qatlama\" is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like pinwheel sandwiches. \"Toqach\" and \"ch\u00f6r\u00e4k\" are varieties of bread, and b\u00f6r\u00e4k is a type of filled pie pastry.\nHerd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called \"sujuk\". Though prohibited by Islamic dietary restrictions, historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of blood sausage. One type of sausage, called \"qazi\u0305\", was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, offal and rice. Chopped meat was called \"q\u00efyma\" and spit-roasted meat was \"s\u00f6kl\u00fcnch\"\u2014from the root \"s\u00f6k-\" meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as kebab in modern times. \"Qawirma\" is a typical fried meat dish, and \"kullama\" is a soup of noodles and lamb.\nReligion.\nEarly Turkic mythology and Tengrism.\nEarly Turkic mythology was dominated by Shamanism, Animism and Tengrism. The Turkic animistic traditions were mostly focused on ancestor worship, polytheistic-animism and shamanism. Later this animistic tradition would form the more organized Tengrism. The chief deity was Tengri, a sky god, worshipped by the upper classes of early Turkic society until Manichaeism was introduced as the official religion of the Uyghur Empire in 763.\nThe wolf symbolizes honour and is also considered the mother of most Turkic peoples. Ashina is the wolf mother of Tumen Il-Qa\u011fan, the first Khan of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks. The horse and predatory birds, such as the eagle or falcon, are also main figures of Turkic mythology.\nReligious conversions.\nBuddhism.\nBuddhism played an important role in the history of Turkic peoples, with the first Turkic state adopting and supporting the spread of Buddhism being the Turkic Shahis and the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks. The G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks syncretized Buddhism with their traditional religion Tengrism and also incorporated elements of the Iranian traditional religions, such as Zoroastrianism. Buddhism had its height among the Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region. Buddhism had also considerable impact and influence onto various other historical Turkic groups. In pre-Islamic times, Buddhism and Tengrism coexisted, with several Buddhist temples, monasteries, figures and steles, with images of Buddhist characters and sceneries, were constructed by various Turkic tribes. Throughout Kazakhstan, there exist various historical Buddhist sites, including an underground Buddhist cave monastery. After the Arab conquest of Central Asia, and the spread of Islam among locals, Buddhism (and Tengrism) started to lose ground, however a certain influence of the Buddhist teachings remained during the next centuries.\nTengri B\u00f6g\u00fc Khan initially made the now extinct Manichaeism the state religion of the Uyghur Khaganate in 763 and it was also popular among the Karluks. It was gradually replaced by the Mahayana Buddhism. It existed in the Buddhist Uyghur Gaochang up to the 12th century.\nTibetan Buddhism, or Vajrayana was the main religion after Manichaeism. They worshipped T\u00e4\u014bri T\u00e4\u014brisi Burxan, Quan\u0161\u00ef Im Pusar and Maitri Burxan. Turkic Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent and west Xinjiang attributed with a rapid and almost total disappearance of it and other religions in North India and Central Asia. The Sari Uygurs \"Yellow Yughurs\" of Western China, as well as the Tuvans of Russia are the only remaining Buddhist Turkic peoples.\nIslam.\nMost Turkic people today are Sunni Muslims, although a significant number in Turkey are Alevis. Alevi Turks, who were once primarily dwelling in eastern Anatolia, are today concentrated in major urban centers in western Turkey with the increased urbanism. Turkic Sunni Muslims generally follow the Hanafi rite. Azeris are traditionally Shiite Muslims. Religious observance is less strict in the Republic of Azerbaijan compared to Iranian Azerbaijan.\n Islam first made contact with the Turkic peoples in 642, when Muslim armies crossed the Amu Darya after toppling the Sassanid Empire the year before. Some of the earliest rulers to convert to Islam were the Turkic princes of the city-states in the region of Sogdiana. Mass conversions did not take place until the Battle of Talas in 751, in which Turkic tribes sided with the Arabs against Chinese forces, which marked a significant milestone in the history of Islam in the region. From then onwards much of the Turkic heartland became Muslim. In the 19th century, Turkic Muslim progressives in the Russian Empire spearheaded a reformist movement called Jadidism, calling for a return to basic Islamic beliefs while simultaneously accepting modernist trends.\nChristianity.\nThe major Christian-Turkic peoples are the Chuvash of Chuvashia and the Gagauz (\"G\u00f6ko\u011fuz\") of Moldova, the vast majority of Chuvash and the Gagauz are Eastern Orthodox Christians. The traditional religion of the Chuvash of Russia, while containing many ancient Turkic concepts, also shares some elements with Zoroastrianism, Khazar Judaism, and Islam.\nThe Chuvash converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity for the most part in the second half of the 19th century. As a result, festivals and rites were made to coincide with Orthodox feasts, and Christian rites replaced their traditional counterparts. A minority of the Chuvash still profess their traditional faith. Between the 9th and 14th centuries, Church of the East was popular among Turks such as the Naimans. It even revived in Gaochang and expanded in Xinjiang in the Yuan dynasty period. It disappeared after its collapse.\nKryashens are a sub-group of the Volga Tatars, and the vast majority are Orthodox Christians. Na\u011fayb\u00e4k are an indigenous Turkic people in Russia, most Na\u011fayb\u00e4k are Christian and were largely converted during the 18th century. Many Volga Tatars were Christianized by Ivan the Terrible during the 16th century, and continued to Christianized under subsequent Russian rulers and Orthodox clergy up to the mid-eighteenth century.\nAnimism.\nToday there are several groups that support a revival of the ancient traditions. Especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union, many in Central Asia converted or openly practice animistic and shamanistic rituals. It is estimated that about 60% of Kyrgyz people practice a form of animistic rituals. In Kazakhstan there are about 54,000 followers of the ancient traditions.\nMuslim Turks and non-Muslim Turks.\nThe Uyghur Turks, who once belonged to a variety of religions, were gradually Islamized during a period spanning the 10th and 13th centuries. Some scholars have linked the phenomenon of recently Islamized Uyghur soldiers recruited by the Mongol Empire to the slow conversion of Uyghur populations to Islam.\nThe non-Muslim Turks' worship of Tengri and other gods was mocked and insulted by the Muslim Turk Mahmud al-Kashgari, who wrote a verse referring to them \u2013 \"The Infidels \u2013 May God destroy them!\"\nThe Basmil, Yab\u0101\u1e33u and Uyghur states were among the Turkic peoples who fought against the Kara-Khanids spread of Islam. The Islamic Kara-Khanids were made out of Tukhsi, Yaghma, \u00c7i\u011fil and Karluk.\nKashgari claimed that the Prophet assisted in a miraculous event where 700,000 Yab\u0101qu infidels were defeated by 40,000 Muslims led by Arsl\u0101n Teg\u012bn claiming that fires shot sparks from gates located on a green mountain towards the Yab\u0101qu. The Yabaqu were a Turkic people.\nMahmud al-Kashgari insulted the Uyghur Buddhists as \"Uighur dogs\" and called them \"Tats\", which referred to the \"Uighur infidels\" according to the Tuxsi and Taghma, while other Turks called Persians \"tat\". While Kashgari displayed a different attitude towards the Turks diviners beliefs and \"national customs\", he expressed towards Buddhism a hatred in his Diwan where he wrote the verse cycle on the war against Uighur Buddhists. Buddhist origin words like toyin (a cleric or priest) and Burx\u0101n or Furxan (meaning Buddha, acquiring the generic meaning of \"idol\" in the Turkic language of Kashgari) had negative connotations to Muslim Turks. \nOld sports.\nTepuk.\nMahmud al-Kashgari in his \"D\u012bw\u0101n Lugh\u0101t al-Turk\", described a game called \"tepuk\" among Turks in Central Asia. In the game, people try to attack each other's castle by kicking a ball made of sheep leather. (see also: Cuju)\nKyz kuu.\nKyz kuu (chase the girl) has been played by Turkic people at festivals since time immemorial.\nJereed.\nHorses have been essential and even sacred animals for Turks living as nomadic tribes in the Central Asian steppes. Turks were born, grew up, lived, fought and died on horseback. Jereed became the most important sporting and ceremonial game of Turkish people.\nKokpar.\nThe kokpar began with the nomadic Turkic peoples who have come from farther north and east spreading westward from China and Mongolia between the 10th and 15th centuries.\nJigit.\n\"jigit\" is used in the Caucasus and Central Asia to describe a skillful and brave equestrian, or a brave person in general.\nGallery.\nBezeklik caves and Mogao grottoes.\nImages of Buddhist and Manichean Old Uyghurs from the Bezeklik caves and Mogao grottoes.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "44743", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44743", "title": "Thomas Hardy", "text": "English novelist and poet (1840\u20131928)\nThomas Hardy (2 June 1840 \u2013 11 January 1928) was an English novelist and poet. A Victorian realist in the tradition of George Eliot, he was influenced both in his novels and in his poetry by Romanticism, including the poetry of William Wordsworth. He was highly critical of much in Victorian society, especially on the declining status of rural people in Britain such as those from his native South West England.\nWhile Hardy wrote poetry throughout his life and regarded himself primarily as a poet, his first collection was not published until 1898. Initially, he gained fame as the author of novels such as \"Far from the Madding Crowd\" (1874), \"The Mayor of Casterbridge\" (1886), \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\" (1891) and \"Jude the Obscure\" (1895). During his lifetime, Hardy's poetry was acclaimed by younger poets (particularly the Georgians) who viewed him as a mentor. After his death his poems were lauded by Ezra Pound, W. H. Auden and Philip Larkin.\nMany of his novels concern tragic characters struggling against their passions and social circumstances, and they are often set in the semi-fictional region of Wessex; initially based on the medieval Anglo-Saxon kingdom, Hardy's Wessex eventually came to include the counties of Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, Devon, Hampshire and much of Berkshire, in south-west and south central England. Two of his novels, \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\" and \"Far from the Madding Crowd\", were listed in the top 50 on the BBC's survey of best-loved novels, The Big Read.\nLife and career.\nEarly life.\nThomas Hardy was born on 2 June 1840 in Higher Bockhampton (then Upper Bockhampton), a hamlet in the parish of Stinsford to the east of Dorchester in Dorset, England, where his father Thomas (1811\u20131892) worked as a stonemason and local builder. His parents had married at Melbury Osmond on 22 December 1839. His mother, Jemima (n\u00e9e Hand; 1813\u20131904), was well read, and she educated Thomas until he went to his first school at Bockhampton at the age of eight. For several years he attended Mr. Last's Academy for Young Gentlemen in Dorchester, where he learned Latin and demonstrated academic potential.\nBecause Hardy's family lacked the means for a university education, his formal education ended at the age of sixteen, when he became apprenticed to James Hicks, a local architect. He worked on the design of the new church at nearby Athelhampton, situated just opposite Athelhampton House where he painted a watercolour of the Tudor gatehouse while visiting his father, who was repairing the masonry of the dovecote.\nHe moved to London in 1862 where he enrolled as a student at King's College London. He won prizes from the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Architectural Association. He joined Arthur Blomfield's practice as assistant architect in April 1862 and worked with Blomfield on Christ Church, East Sheen Richmond, London where the tower collapsed in 1863, and All Saints' parish church in Windsor, Berkshire, in 1862\u201364. A reredos, possibly designed by Hardy, was discovered behind panelling at All Saints' in August 2016. In the mid-1860s, Hardy was in charge of the excavation of part of the graveyard of St Pancras Old Church before its destruction when the Midland Railway was extended to a new terminus at St Pancras.\nHardy never felt at home in London, because he was acutely conscious of class divisions and his own feelings of social inferiority. During this time he became interested in social reform and the works of John Stuart Mill. He was introduced by his Dorset friend Horace Moule to the works of Charles Fourier and Auguste Comte. Mill's essay \"On Liberty\" was one of Hardy's cures for despair, and in 1924 he declared that \"my pages show harmony of view with\" Mill. He was also attracted to Matthew Arnold's and Leslie Stephen's ideal of the urbane liberal freethinker.\nAfter five years, concerned about his health, he returned to Dorset, settling in Weymouth, and decided to dedicate himself to writing.\nPersonal.\nIn 1870, while on an architectural mission to restore the parish church of St Juliot in Cornwall, Hardy met and fell in love with Emma Gifford, whom he married on 17 September 1874, at St Peter's Church, Paddington, London. The couple rented St David's Villa, Southborough (now Surbiton) for a year. \nIn 1885 they moved to Max Gate in Dorchester, a house designed by Hardy and built by his brother. Although later the couple became estranged, Emma's death in 1912 had a traumatic effect on him and Hardy made a trip to Cornwall after her death to revisit places linked with their courtship. His \"Poems 1912\u201313\" reflect upon her death. He remained preoccupied with his first wife's death and tried to overcome his remorse by writing poetry.\nIn 1914, Hardy married his secretary Florence Emily Dugdale, who was 39 years his junior. \nIn his later years, he kept a Wire Fox Terrier named Wessex, who was notoriously ill-tempered. Wessex's grave stone can be found on the Max Gate grounds.\nIn 1910 Hardy was appointed a Member of the Order of Merit and was also for the first time nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature. He was nominated again for the prize 11 years later and by 1927 had received a total of 25 nominations. In 1923 he was one of the final candidates for the prize, but did not win.\nHardy and the theatre.\nHardy's interest in the theatre dated from the 1860s. He corresponded with various would-be adapters over the years, including Robert Louis Stevenson in 1886 and Jack Grein and Charles Jarvis in the same decade. Neither adaptation came to fruition, but Hardy showed he was potentially enthusiastic about such a project. One play that was performed, however, caused him a certain amount of pain. His experience of the controversy and lukewarm critical reception that had surrounded his and Comyns Carr's adaptation of \"Far from the Madding Crowd\" in 1882 left him wary of the damage that adaptations could do to his literary reputation. So, in 1908, he so readily and enthusiastically became involved with a local amateur group, at the time known as the Dorchester Dramatic and Debating Society, but that would become the Hardy Players. His reservations about adaptations of his novels meant he was initially at some pains to disguise his involvement in the play. However, the international success of the play, \"The Trumpet Major\", led to a long and successful collaboration between Hardy and the Players over the remaining years of his life. Indeed, his play \"The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse\" (1923) was written to be performed by the Hardy Players.\nLater years.\nFrom the 1880s, Hardy became increasingly involved in campaigns to save ancient buildings from destruction, or destructive modernisation, and he became an early member of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. His correspondence refers to his unsuccessful efforts to prevent major alterations to the parish church at Puddletown, close to his home at Max Gate. He became a frequent visitor at Athelhampton House, which he knew from his teenage years, and in his letters he encouraged the owner, Alfred Cart de Lafontaine, to conduct the restoration of that building in a sensitive way.\nIn 1914, Hardy was one of 53 leading British authors\u2014including H. G. Wells, Rudyard Kipling and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2014who signed their names to the \"Authors' Declaration\", justifying Britain's involvement in the First World War. This manifesto declared that the German invasion of Belgium had been a brutal crime, and that Britain \"could not without dishonour have refused to take part in the present war.\" Hardy was horrified by the destruction caused by the war, pondering that \"I do not think a world in which such fiendishness is possible to be worth the saving\" and \"better to let western 'civilization' perish, and let the black and yellow races have a chance.\" He wrote to John Galsworthy that \"the exchange of international thought is the only possible salvation for the world.\"\nShortly after helping to excavate the Fordington mosaic, Hardy became ill with pleurisy in December 1927 and died at Max Gate just after 9\u00a0pm on 11\u00a0January 1928, having dictated his final poem to his wife on his deathbed; the cause of death was cited, on his death certificate, as \"cardiac syncope\", with \"old age\" given as a contributory factor. His funeral was on 16 January at Westminster Abbey, and it proved a controversial occasion because Hardy had wished for his body to be interred at Stinsford in the same grave as his first wife, Emma. His family and friends concurred; however, his executor, Sir\u00a0Sydney Carlyle Cockerell, insisted that he be placed in the abbey's famous Poets' Corner. A compromise was reached whereby his heart was buried at Stinsford with Emma, and his ashes in Poets' Corner. Hardy's estate at death was valued at \u00a395,418 ().\nShortly after Hardy's death, the executors of his estate burnt his letters and notebooks, but 12 notebooks survived, one of them containing notes and extracts of newspaper stories from the 1820s, and research into these has provided insight into how Hardy used them in his works. The opening chapter of \"The Mayor of Casterbridge\", for example, written in 1886, was based on press reports of wife-selling. In the year of his death Mrs Hardy published \"The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, 1841\u20131891\", compiled largely from contemporary notes, letters, diaries and biographical memoranda, as well as from oral information in conversations extending over many years.\nHardy's work was admired by many younger writers, including D. H. Lawrence, John Cowper Powys and Virginia Woolf. In his autobiography \"Good-Bye to All That\" (1929), Robert Graves recalls meeting Hardy in Dorset in the early 1920s and how Hardy received him and his new wife warmly, and was encouraging about his work.\nHardy's birthplace in Bockhampton and his house Max Gate, both in Dorchester, are owned by the National Trust.\nNovels.\nHardy's first novel, \"The Poor Man and the Lady\", finished by 1867, failed to find a publisher. He then showed it to his mentor and friend, the Victorian poet and novelist George Meredith, who felt that \"The Poor Man and the Lady\" would be too politically controversial and might damage Hardy's ability to publish in the future. So Hardy followed his advice and he did not try further to publish it. He subsequently destroyed the manuscript, but used some of the ideas in his later work. In his recollections in \"Life and Work\", Hardy described the book as \"socialistic, not to say revolutionary; yet not argumentatively so.\"\nAfter he abandoned his first novel, Hardy wrote two new ones that he hoped would have more commercial appeal, \"Desperate Remedies\" (1871) and \"Under the Greenwood Tree\" (1872), both of which were published anonymously; it was while working on the latter that he met Emma Gifford, who would become his wife. In 1873 \"A Pair of Blue Eyes\", a novel drawing on Hardy's courtship of Emma, was published under his own name. A plot device popularised by Charles Dickens, the term \"cliffhanger\" is considered to have originated with the serialised version of \"A Pair of Blue Eyes\" (published in \"Tinsley's Magazine\" between September 1872 and July 1873) in which Henry Knight, one of the protagonists, is left literally hanging off a cliff. Elements of Hardy's fiction reflect the influence of the commercially successful sensation fiction of the 1860s, particularly the legal complications in novels such as \"Desperate Remedies\" (1871), \"Far from the Madding Crowd\" (1874) and \"Two on a Tower\" (1882).\nIn \"Far from the Madding Crowd\", Hardy first introduced the idea of calling the region in the west of England, where his novels are set, Wessex. Wessex had been the name of an early Saxon kingdom, in approximately the same part of England. \"Far from the Madding Crowd\" was successful enough for Hardy to give up architectural work and pursue a literary career. Over the next 25 years, Hardy produced 10 more novels.\nSubsequently, Hardy moved from London to Yeovil, and then to Sturminster Newton, where he wrote \"The Hand of Ethelberta\" (1876) and \"The Return of the Native\" (1878). In 1880, Hardy published his only historical novel, \"The Trumpet-Major\". The next year, in 1881, \"A Laodicean\" was published. A further move to Wimborne saw Hardy write \"Two on a Tower\", published in 1882, a romance story set in the world of astronomy. Then in 1885, they moved for the last time, to Max Gate, a house outside Dorchester designed by Hardy and built by his brother. There he wrote \"The Mayor of Casterbridge\" (1886), \"The Woodlanders\" (1887) and \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\" (1891), the last of which attracted criticism for its sympathetic portrayal of a \"fallen woman\", and initially it was refused publication. Its subtitle, \"A Pure Woman: Faithfully Presented\", was intended to raise the eyebrows of the Victorian middle classes.\n\"Jude the Obscure\", published in 1895, was the last novel written by Hardy. It was met with an even stronger negative response from the Victorian public because of its controversial treatment of sex, religion and marriage. Its apparent attack on the institution of marriage caused strain on Hardy's already difficult marriage because Emma Hardy was concerned that \"Jude the Obscure\" would be read as autobiographical. Some booksellers sold the novel in brown paper bags, and Walsham How, the Bishop of Wakefield, is reputed to have burnt his copy. In his postscript of 1912, Hardy humorously referred to this incident as part of the career of the book: \"After these [hostile] verdicts from the press its next misfortune was to be burnt by a bishop \u2013 probably in his despair at not being able to burn me\". Despite this, Hardy had become a celebrity by the 1900s, but some argue that he gave up writing novels because of the criticism of both \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\" and \"Jude the Obscure\". However, in a March 1928 piece in the \"Bookman\" that posthumously printed interviews with Hardy, he is quoted as saying that, in addition to the negative publicity, he chose to stop writing novels because \"I never cared very much about writing novels\" and \"I had written quite enough novels.\"\n\"The Well-Beloved\", first serialised in 1892 and written before \"Jude the Obscure\", was the last of Hardy's fourteen novels to be published, in 1897.\nLiterary themes.\nConsidered a Victorian realist, Hardy examines the social constraints on the lives of those living in Victorian England, and criticises those beliefs, especially those relating to marriage, education and religion, that limited people's lives and caused unhappiness. Such unhappiness, and the suffering it brings, is seen by poet Philip Larkin as central in Hardy's works:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What is the intensely maturing experience of which Hardy's modern man is most sensible? In my view it is suffering, or sadness, and extended consideration of the centrality of suffering in Hardy's work should be the first duty of the true critic for which the work is still waiting [...] Any approach to his work, as to any writer's work, must seek first of all to determine what element is peculiarly his, which imaginative note he strikes most plangently, and to deny that in this case it is the sometimes gentle, sometimes ironic, sometimes bitter but always passive apprehension of suffering is, I think, wrong-headed.\nIn \"Two on a Tower\", for example, Hardy takes a stand against these rules of society with a story of love that crosses the boundaries of class. The reader is forced to reconsider the conventions set up by society for the relationships between men and women. Nineteenth-century society had conventions, which were enforced. In this novel Swithin St Cleeve's idealism pits him against such contemporary social constraints.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In a novel structured around contrasts, the main opposition is between Swithin St Cleeve and Lady Viviette Constantine, who are presented as binary figures in a series of ways: aristocratic and lower class, youthful and mature, single and married, fair and dark, religious and agnostic...she [Lady Viviette Constantine] is also deeply conventional, absurdly wishing to conceal their marriage until Swithin has achieved social status through his scientific work, which gives rise to uncontrolled ironies and tragic-comic misunderstandings.\nFate or chance is another important theme. Hardy's characters often encounter crossroads on a journey, a junction that offers alternative physical destinations but which is also symbolic of a point of opportunity and transition, further suggesting that fate is at work. \"Far from the Madding Crowd\" is an example of a novel in which chance has a major role: \"Had Bathsheba not sent the valentine, had Fanny not missed her wedding, for example, the story would have taken an entirely different path.\" Indeed, Hardy's main characters often seem to be held in fate's overwhelming grip.\nPoetry.\nIn 1898, Hardy published his first volume of poetry, \"Wessex Poems\", a collection of poems written over 30 years. While some suggest that Hardy gave up writing novels following the harsh criticism of \"Jude the Obscure\" in 1896, the poet C. H. Sisson calls this \"hypothesis\" \"superficial and absurd\". In the twentieth century Hardy published only poetry.\nThomas Hardy published \"Poems of the Past and the Present\" in 1901, which contains \"The Darkling Thrush\" (originally titled \"The Century's End\"), one of his best known poems about the turn of the century.\nThomas Hardy wrote in a great variety of poetic forms, including lyrics, ballads, satire, dramatic monologues and dialogue, as well as a three-volume epic closet drama \"The Dynasts\" (1904\u201308), and though in some ways a very traditional poet, because he was influenced by folksong and ballads, he \"was never conventional,\" and \"persistently experiment[ed] with different, often invented, stanza forms and metres,\" and made use of \"rough-hewn rhythms and colloquial diction\".\nIn a re-evaluation of \"The Dynasts\" in 2006 Keith Wilson wrote, \"\"The Dynasts\", this unusual work that allowed him [Hardy] to explore what he had noticed about human beings over the most ambitious canvas that he had ever attempted, should stand among his greatest achievements.\"\nHardy wrote a number of significant war poems that relate to both the Boer Wars and World War I, including \"Drummer Hodge\", \"In Time of 'The Breaking of Nations'\" and \"The Man He Killed\"; his work had a profound influence on other war poets such as Rupert Brooke and Siegfried Sassoon. Hardy in these poems often used the viewpoint of ordinary soldiers and their colloquial speech. A theme in the \"Wessex Poems\" is the long shadow that the Napoleonic Wars cast over the 19th century, as seen, for example, in \"The Sergeant's Song\" and \"Leipzig\". The Napoleonic War is the subject of \"The Dynasts\".\nSome of Hardy's more famous poems are from \"Poems 1912\u201313\", which later became part of \"Satires of Circumstance\" (1914), written following the death of his wife Emma in 1912. They had been estranged for 20 years, and these lyric poems express deeply felt \"regret and remorse\". Poems like \"After a Journey\", \"The Voice\" and others from this collection \"are by general consent regarded as the peak of his poetic achievement\". In a 2007 biography on Hardy, Claire Tomalin argues that Hardy became a truly great English poet after the death of his first wife Emma, beginning with these elegies, which she describes as among \"the finest and strangest celebrations of the dead in English poetry.\"\nMany of Hardy's poems deal with themes of disappointment in love and life, and \"the perversity of fate\", presenting these themes with \"a carefully controlled elegiac feeling\". Irony is an important element in a number of Hardy's poems, including \"The Man He Killed\" and \"Are You Digging on My Grave\". A few of Hardy's poems, such as \"The Blinded Bird\", a melancholy polemic against the sport of , reflect his firm stance against animal cruelty, exhibited in his antivivisectionist views and his membership in the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\nAlthough his poems were initially not as well received as his novels had been, Hardy is now recognised as one of the great poets of the 20th century, and his verse had a profound influence on later writers, including Robert Frost, W. H. Auden, Dylan Thomas and Philip Larkin. Larkin included 27 poems by Hardy compared with only nine by T. S. Eliot in his edition of \"The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse\" in 1973. There were fewer poems by W. B. Yeats. Poet-critic Donald Davie's \"Thomas Hardy and English Poetry\" considers Hardy's contribution to ongoing poetic tradition at length and in creative depth. Davie's friend Thom Gunn also wrote on Hardy and acknowledged his stature and example.\nReligious beliefs.\nHardy's family was Anglican, but not especially devout. He was baptised at the age of five weeks and attended church, where his father and uncle contributed to music. He did not attend the local Church of England school, instead being sent to Mr Last's school, three miles away. As a young adult, he befriended Henry R. Bastow (a Plymouth Brethren man), who also worked as a pupil architect, and who was preparing for adult baptism in the Baptist Church. Hardy flirted with conversion, but decided against it. Bastow went to Australia and maintained a long correspondence with Hardy, but eventually Hardy tired of these exchanges and the correspondence ceased. This concluded Hardy's links with the Baptists.\nThe irony and struggles of life, coupled with his naturally curious mind, led him to question the traditional Christian view of God: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Christian God\u00a0\u2013 the external personality\u00a0\u2013 has been replaced by the intelligence of the First Cause...the replacement of the old concept of God as all-powerful by a new concept of universal consciousness. The 'tribal god, man-shaped, fiery-faced and tyrannous' is replaced by the 'unconscious will of the Universe' which progressively grows aware of itself and 'ultimately, it is to be hoped, sympathetic'.\nScholars have debated Hardy's religious leanings for years, often unable to reach a consensus. Once, when asked in correspondence by a clergyman, Dr. A. B. Grosart, about the question of reconciling the horrors of human and animal life with \"the absolute goodness and non-limitation of God\", Hardy replied,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Mr. Hardy regrets that he is unable to offer any hypothesis which would reconcile the existence of such evils as Dr. Grosart describes with the idea of omnipotent goodness. Perhaps Dr. Grosart might be helped to a provisional view of the universe by the recently published \"Life of Darwin\" and the works of Herbert Spencer and other agnostics.\nHardy frequently conceived of, and wrote about, supernatural forces, particularly those that control the universe through indifference or caprice, a force he called The Immanent Will. He also showed in his writing some degree of fascination with ghosts and spirits. Even so, he retained a strong emotional attachment to the Christian liturgy and church rituals, particularly as manifested in rural communities, that had been such a formative influence in his early years, and Biblical references can be found woven throughout many of Hardy's novels.\nHardy's friends during his apprenticeship to John Hicks included Horace Moule (one of the eight sons of Henry Moule) and the poet William Barnes, both ministers of religion. Moule remained a close friend of Hardy's for the rest of his life, and introduced him to new scientific findings that cast doubt on literal interpretations of the Bible, such as those of Gideon Mantell. Moule gave Hardy a copy of Mantell's book \"The Wonders of Geology\" (1848) in 1858, and Adelene Buckland has suggested that there are \"compelling similarities\" between the \"cliffhanger\" section from \"A Pair of Blue Eyes\" and Mantell's geological descriptions. It has also been suggested that the character of Henry Knight in \"A Pair of Blue Eyes\" was based on Horace Moule.\nThroughout his life, Hardy sought a rationale for believing in an afterlife or a timeless existence, turning first to spiritualists, such as Henri Bergson, and then to Albert Einstein and J. M. E. McTaggart, considering their philosophy on time and space in relation to immortality.\nLocations in novels.\nSites associated with Hardy's own life and which inspired the settings of his novels continue to attract literary tourists and casual visitors. For locations in Hardy's novels see: Thomas Hardy's Wessex, and the Thomas Hardy's Wessex research site, which includes maps.\nInfluence.\nHardy corresponded with and visited Lady Catherine Milnes Gaskell at Wenlock Abbey and many of Lady Catherine's books are inspired by Hardy, who was very fond of her.\nD. H. Lawrence's \"Study of Thomas Hardy\" (1914, first published 1936) indicates the importance of Hardy for him, even though this work is a platform for Lawrence's own developing philosophy rather than a more standard literary study. The influence of Hardy's treatment of character, and Lawrence's own response to the central metaphysic behind many of Hardy's novels, helped significantly in the development of \"The Rainbow\" (1915) and \"Women in Love\" (1920).\n\"Wood and Stone\" (1915), the first novel by John Cowper Powys, who was a contemporary of Lawrence, was \"Dedicated with devoted admiration to the greatest poet and novelist of our age Thomas Hardy\". Powys's later novel \"Maiden Castle\" (1936) is set in Dorchester, which was Hardy's Casterbridge, and was intended by Powys to be a \"rival\" to Hardy's \"The Mayor of Casterbridge\". \"Maiden Castle\" is the last of Powys's so-called Wessex novels, \"Wolf Solent\" (1929), \"A Glastonbury Romance\" (1932) and \"Weymouth Sands\" (1934), which are set in Somerset and Dorset.\nHardy was clearly the starting point for the character of the novelist Edward Driffield in W. Somerset Maugham's novel \"Cakes and Ale\" (1930). Thomas Hardy's works also feature prominently in the American playwright Christopher Durang's \"The Marriage of Bette and Boo\" (1985), in which a graduate thesis analysing \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\" is interspersed with analysis of Matt's family's neuroses.\nMusical settings.\nA number of notable English composers, including Gerald Finzi, Benjamin Britten, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Gustav Holst set poems by Hardy to music. Others include Holst's daughter Imogen Holst, John Ireland, Muriel Herbert, Ivor Gurney and Robin Milford. Orchestral tone poems which evoke the landscape of Hardy's novels include Ireland's \"Mai-Dun\" (1921) and Holst's \"Egdon Heath: A Homage to Thomas Hardy\" (1927).\nHardy has been a significant influence on Nigel Blackwell, frontman of the post-punk British rock band Half Man Half Biscuit, who has often incorporated phrases (some obscure) by or about Hardy into his song lyrics.\nWorks.\nProse.\nIn 1912, Hardy divided his novels and collected short stories into three classes:\nOther.\nHardy also produced minor tales; one story, \"The Spectre of the Real\" (1894) was written in collaboration with Florence Henniker. An additional short-story collection, beyond the ones mentioned above, is \"A Changed Man and Other Tales\" (1913). Ten stories that were never published in volumes during Hardy's lifetime have been gathered together and published as \"The Excluded and Collaborative Stories\" by Hardy scholar Pamela Dalziel. His works have been collected as the 24-volume Wessex Edition (1912\u201313) and the 37-volume Mellstock Edition (1919\u201320). His largely self-written biography appears under his second wife's name in two volumes from 1928 to 1930, as \"The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, 1840\u201391\" and \"The Later Years of Thomas Hardy, 1892\u20131928\", now published in a critical one-volume edition as \"The Life and Work of Thomas Hardy\", edited by Michael Millgate (1984).\nPoetry collections.\nOnline poems: Poems by Thomas Hardy at Poetry Foundation and Poems by Thomas Hardy at poemhunter.com\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBiographies and criticism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
