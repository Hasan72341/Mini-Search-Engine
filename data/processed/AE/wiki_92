It is known for films and television series made using stop-motion and clay animation techniques, particularly those featuring its plasticine characters from \"Wallace &amp; Gromit\",\n\"Chicken Run\", \"Shaun the Sheep\", and \"Morph\". After some experimental computer-animated short films during the late 1990s, beginning with \"Owzat\" (1997), Aardman entered the computer animation market with \"Flushed Away\" (2006). As of February 2020, it had earned $1.1 billion worldwide, with an average $135.6 million per film. Between 2000 and 2006, Aardman collaborated with DreamWorks Animation.\nAardman's films have been consistently well-received. Their stop-motion films are among the highest-grossing produced, with their 2000 debut, \"Chicken Run\", being their top-grossing film, as well as the highest-grossing stop-motion film of all time. A sequel, \"\", was released in 2023.\nHistory.\n1972\u20131996.\nAardman was founded in 1972 as a low-budget project by Peter Lord and David Sproxton, who wanted to realise their dream of producing an animated motion picture. The collaboration provided animated sequences for the BBC series for deaf children \"Vision On\". The company name originates from the name of their nerdy Superman character in that series. The process of using clay animation to produce a segment called \"Gleebees\" (1975) became the inspiration for creating Morph, a simple clay character. Around the same time, Lord and Sproxton made their first foray into adult animation with the shorts \"Down and Out\" and \"Confessions of a Foyer Girl\", entries in the BBC's \"Animated Conversations\" series using real-life conversations as soundtracks.\nAardman also created the title sequence for \"The Great Egg Race\" and supplied animation for the multiple award-winning music video of Peter Gabriel's song \"Sledgehammer\". They produced the music video for the song \"My Baby Just Cares For Me\" by Nina Simone in 1987. Also in the 1980s, they created the trombone-playing character Douglas in a television commercial for Lurpak butter.\nLater, Aardman produced several shorts for Channel 4, including the \"Conversation Pieces\" series. These five shorts worked in the same area as the \"Animated Conversations\" pieces, but were more sophisticated. Lord and Sproxton began hiring more animators at this point; three of the newcomers made their directorial debut at Aardman with the \"Lip Synch\" series. Of the five \"Lip Synch\" shorts, two were directed by Lord, one by Barry Purves, one by Richard Goleszowski and one by Nick Park.\nIn 1990, Park's short, \"Creature Comforts\", was the first Aardman Animations film to win an Academy Award. Park also developed the clay modelled shorts featuring the adventures of Wallace &amp; Gromit, a comical pair of friends: Wallace being a naive English inventor with a love of cheese, and Gromit, his best friend, the intelligent, muted dog. These films include \"A Grand Day Out\" (1989), \"The Wrong Trousers\" (1993) and \"A Close Shave\" (1995), the latter two winning Academy Awards.\n1997\u20132007.\nIn December 1997, Aardman, DreamWorks (now known as DreamWorks Animation) and Path\u00e9 announced that their companies were collaborating to co-finance and distribute \"Chicken Run\", Aardman's first feature film, which had already been in pre-production for a year. On 27 October 1999, Aardman and DreamWorks signed a $250 million deal to make an additional four films that were estimated to be completed during the next 12 years. Along with the deal their first project was announced, titled \"The Tortoise and the Hare\". Intended to be based on Aesop's fable and directed by Richard Goleszowski, it was paused two years later because of script problems. On 23 June 2000, \"Chicken Run\" was released to a great critical and financial success. In 2005, after ten years of absence, Wallace and Gromit are back in Academy Award-winning \"\". The following year \"Flushed Away\", Aardman's first computer-animated feature, was released.\nOn 10 October 2005, a serious fire at a storage facility used by Aardman and other Bristol-based companies destroyed over 30 years of props, models, and scenery often built by the Bristol-based Cod Steaks. This warehouse was used for storage of past projects and so did not prevent the production of their current projects at the time. In addition, the company's library of finished films was stored elsewhere and was undamaged. An electrical fault was determined to be the cause of the blaze. Referring to the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, Park was quoted as saying, \"Even though it is a precious and nostalgic collection and valuable to the company, in light of other tragedies, today isn't a big deal.\"\nOn 1 October 2006, right before the release of \"Flushed Away\", \"The New York Times\" reported that due to creative differences, DreamWorks Animation and Aardman had decided to finish their agreement. The deal was officially terminated on 30 January 2007. According to an Aardman spokesperson: \"The business model of DreamWorks no longer suits Aardman and vice versa. But the split couldn't have been more amicable.\" Unofficial reasons for departure were weak performances of the last two movies, for which DreamWorks had to take writedowns, and citing the article, \"Aardman executives chafed at the creative control DreamWorks tried to exert, particularly with \"Flushed Away\"...\" The studio had another film in development, \"Crood Awakening\" (eventually \"The Croods\"), which had been announced in 2005, with John Cleese co-writing the screenplay. With the end of the partnership, the film's rights reverted to DreamWorks.\nFrom 2006 to 2007, the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan, had an exhibit featuring the works of Aardman Studios. Sproxton and Lord visited the exhibit in May 2006 and met with animator Hayao Miyazaki during the visit. Miyazaki has long been a fan of Aardman Animations' works.\n2007\u20132012.\nIn April 2007, Aardman signed and in 2010 renewed a three-year deal with Sony Pictures to finance, co-produce and distribute feature films. The next year, Aardman released a new \"Wallace and Gromit\" short film called \"A Matter of Loaf and Death\". The first film made in collaboration with Sony was the computer-animated \"Arthur Christmas\" (2011), Aardman's first 3D feature film. 2012 saw the release of \"The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!\" (known internationally in America as \"The Pirates! Band of Misfits\"), Aardman's first 3D stop-motion film and Lord's first film as a director since \"Chicken Run\". Two additional films were announced in June 2007: \"The Cat Burglars\", a stop-motion animated heist comedy film directed by Steve Box, about cat burglars that steal milk and their plans to pull off 'the great milk float robbery'; and an untitled Nick Park project (which would later become \"Early Man\").\nThe studio is also known for providing generous resources and training to young animators, including awards at various animation festivals. For example, the Aardman Award at the UK's Animex Festival in Teesside provides story consultation to a promising young animator for their next film.\nIn 2008, Aardman collaborated with Channel 4 and Lupus Films to launch a user-generated content animation portal called 4mations. They also designed the BBC One Christmas Idents for that year, which featured Wallace and Gromit to tie in with the showing of the new Wallace and Gromit film called \"A Matter of Loaf and Death\" on Christmas Day at 8:30pm. In April 2008, Aardman launched the Aardman YouTube channel, which is a YouTube Partner channel featuring the entire \"Creature Comforts\" TV series, the Morph series, \"Cracking Contraptions\" and clips from the Wallace and Gromit films. From December 2008, Aardman also started posting various flash games on Newgrounds, the majority of which are based on \"Wallace and Gromit\" and \"Shaun the Sheep\".\nIn 2009, Nintendo announced that Aardman would make twelve short films using only Flipnote Studio. The films were posted on Flipnote's Hatena web service provider. The first film was called \"The Sandwich Twins\" and was released on 16 September 2009. The remaining eleven films were released on a weekly basis until Christmas, and can also be downloaded using Hatena. In the same year, the headquarters of the studio moved into a new building, designed by Alec French architects, in Gas Ferry Road, Bristol, although work needing large-scale sets is still carried out in sheds in Aztec West and Bedminster. In April 2009, Aardman Animations edited the existing Watch identity by UKTV to make the inflatable eyeball (called \"Blinky\") in the idents blink.\n2013\u20132019.\nIn October 2013, Lord (co-founder of Aardman Animations) created a fundraising project on the crowdfunding site Kickstarter. The campaign has a target of \u00a375,000 which would be used to fund 12 new one-minute episodes of Morph. Lord was hoping to start production in January 2014 using the original stop-frame animation. Backers of the project would receive a variety of rewards, including early access to the new animations and a small box of clay used in the production, depending on the individual's level of funding.\nIn 2015, the studio bought a majority share in New York-based animation studio Nathan Love, announcing the merger with a short film called \"Introducing: Aardman Nathan Love\" on 25 September of the same year of that being that the British stop-motion animated series \"Digby Dragon\" debuted on Nick Jr. UK in 2016.\nIn advance of Aardman's 40th anniversary, the BBC One channel aired the one-hour television documentary \"A Grand Night In: The Story of Aardman\", first broadcast in December 2015. Narrated by Julie Walters, this career retrospective includes commentary by the company's founders and staff, as well as various friends, fans and colleagues including Terry Gilliam, John Lasseter, and Matt Groening.\nFrom 29 June 2017 to 29 October 2017, an exhibition entitled \"Wallace &amp; Gromit and Friends\" was shown at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI) in Melbourne. A report on this exhibition was shown on Australian \"ABC News Breakfast\" on Wednesday, 28 June, featuring an eight-minute interview with producers Lord and Sproxton. The exhibition revealed that in Park's very early sketches, Gromit was originally a cat, but Park soon changed him into a dog, since it was generally agreed that a dog was clearly more suitable as a loyal pet/companion than a cat and also because a dog would be easier to make and animate in Plasticine. Embedded in the ABC News article is a video interview with Lord and Sproxton, which gives information not only on Wallace and Gromit, but also Shaun the Sheep and others.\nOn 9 November 2018, Aardman Animations announced that Lord and Sproxton would be transferring majority ownership of the company to its employees in order to keep the studio independent. In January 2019, Lord and Sproxton released a book detailing the history of the studio, called \"A Grand Success! The Aardman Journey, One Frame at a Time\".\n2020\u2013present.\nIn December 2020, Netflix announced an Aardman Christmas musical special entitled \"Robin Robin\". The 30-minute short, starring Bronte Carmichael, Richard E. Grant, Gillian Anderson and Adeel Akhtar, was released on the platform on 24 November 2021.\nOn 9 August 2021, it was announced that Gurinder Chadha was directing a musical claymation feature set in India, telling the story of an elephant dreaming about becoming a dancer.\nOn 30 November 2021, Aardman began producing \"The Very Small Creatures\" for Sky Kids and Apple TV.\nOn 20 January 2022, Netflix announced a sequel to \"Chicken Run\" entitled \"\". The film, starring Thandiwe Newton and Zachary Levi, premiered on the platform on 15 December 2023. A new \"Wallace and Gromit\" film was also confirmed to be 'in the works' for a 2024 release on the BBC in the UK and Netflix for the rest the world. Also in 2022\u20132023, the 52 episode children's series \"Lloyd of the Flies\" aired on CITV.\nAardman is one of the nine studios involved with Lucasfilm's \" Volume 2\", contributing the film \"I Am Your Mother\".\nNewclay Products, the factory that made Lewis Newplast, the modelling clay used by Aardman, shut down in March 2023; Aardman purchased enough remaining clay to cover the 2024 \"Wallace and Gromit\" film. \"The Daily Telegraph\" initially reported that the studio may not be able to produce new films afterwards due to a lack of clay, but Aardman later released a statement clarifying that it would find a new supplier.\nOn 1 March 2024, the company announced a number of changes. Emma Hardie was to take up the newly created role of Executive Commercial and Brand Director, and would be responsible for overseeing the financing, distribution, licensing, marketing, and planning of the studio's animated intellectual property. She took up the role, which includes a seat on Aardman's executive board, on April 15. Peter Lord was also stepping down from Aardman's executive board to focus on a slate of individual projects as the Creative Director and would act as an ambassador for the company and British animation. Among the announcements, Sarah Cox and Daniel Efergan were promoted to Chief Creative Director and Executive Creative Director of Interactive &amp; Innovation, respectively.\nOn 8 March 2024 Aardman and the BBC announced a new collaboration called \"Things We Love\", based on the studio's \"Creature Comforts\" films, set to air throughout 2024. Like \"Creature Comforts\", the six, 30-second-long shorts feature animated animals matched to the audio of real, unscripted interviews.\nOn 6 June 2024, Aardman announced the title of the new \"Wallace and Gromit\" feature film as \"\".\nOn 22 September 2024, Cartoon Network announced on Twitter that they had recruited Aardman to work on an \"Over the Garden Wall\" special alongside series creator Patrick McHale to celebrate the miniseries' 10th anniversary, set for release on 3 November 2024. On 21 October 2024, Aardman announced that they would team up with Mattel Television Studios to produce a new \"Pingu\" series. Additionally, on 11 December that year, it was announced that Aardman would be collaborating with The Pok\u00e9mon Company for a project in 2027.\nOn 7 May 2025, Aardman announced that they were developing a new \"Shaun the Sheep\" feature film titled \"Shaun the Sheep: The Beast of Mossy Bottom\", set for release in theaters and on the Sky Cinema channel in 2026.\nCompany name.\nThe company name is taken from one of its early characters, a superhero created for \"Vision On\" in 1972. Unlike the claymation productions that the company are famous for, Aardman was cel-animated. Peter Lord has stated that the most interesting thing about the company name is that it \"means nothing\" and is only a joke that two teenagers found funny. He has stated that the name came from a combination of \"Aardvark\" and \"Superman\" for the reason that they found \"aardvark\" to be a particularly funny word. Aardman Animations became their company name when the BBC asked them to whom they should make their first cheque out. Co-founder David Sproxton has claimed that the name was a result of being unable to \"find another word with more A's in it than 'aardvark'\" as a schoolboy.\nNon-Aardman productions by Aardman directors.\nA number of Aardman directors have worked at other studios, taking the distinctive Aardman style with them.\nAardman's Steve Box directed the animated music video for the Spice Girls' final single as a five-piece, \"Viva Forever\". The video took over five months to produce, considerably longer than the group's box office hit movie, \"Spice World\". He is also the co-creator of the Finnish-British animated series \"Moominvalley\", based on the Moomins books.\nBarry Purves, director of the Aardman short \"Next\", also directed \"Hamilton Mattress\" for Harvest Films. The film, a half-hour special that premiered on Christmas Day 2001, was produced by Chris Moll, producer of the \"Wallace &amp; Gromit\" short film \"The Wrong Trousers\". The models were provided by Mackinnon &amp; Saunders, a firm that did the same for \"Bob the Builder\" and \"Corpse Bride\".\nSimilarly, \"Robbie the Reindeer in Hooves of Fire\", a BBC Bristol/Comic Relief production, was directed by Richard Goleszowski, creator of \"Rex the Runt\". Its sequel, \"Robbie the Reindeer in Legend of the Lost Tribe\", was directed by Peter Peake, whose directorial credits for Aardman include \"Pib and Pog\" and \"Humdrum\".\nAardman alumni also produced many of the claymation shorts used in the 1986\u20131990 American television series \"Pee-wee's Playhouse\".\nFilms.\nAardman Animations has produced a number of animated features, shorts, videos and TV series, as well as adverts. Their major feature films are:\nDivisions.\nAardman Features.\nAardman Features Limited is a motion picture subsidiary of Aardman Animations.

Although the population recorded in the 2021 census was only 11,145, and with a built-up area of just , Wells has had city status since medieval times, because of the presence of Wells Cathedral. Often described as England's smallest city, it is actually the second smallest to the City of London in area and population, but unlike London it is not part of a larger urban agglomeration.\nWells takes its name from three holy wells dedicated to Saint Andrew that lie within the grounds of the Bishop's Palace and cathedral and supply water to the marketplace. A small Roman settlement surrounded them, which grew in importance and size under the Anglo-Saxons when King Ine of Wessex founded a minster church there in 704. The community became a trading centre based on cloth making and Wells is notable for its 17th-century involvement in both the English Civil War and the Monmouth Rebellion. In the 19th century, transport infrastructure improved with stations on three different railway lines. However, following the Beeching axe in 1964 the city has been without a railway link.\nThe cathedral and the associated religious and medieval architectural history provide much of the employment. The city has a variety of sporting and cultural activities and houses several schools including The Blue School, a state coeducational comprehensive school that was founded in 1641, and the private Wells Cathedral School, which was founded possibly as early as 909 and is one of the five established musical schools for school-age children in the United Kingdom. Wells's historic architecture has led to the city being used as a shooting location for numerous films and television programmes.\nHistory.\nThe city was a Roman settlement that became an important centre under the Anglo-Saxons when King Ine of Wessex founded a minster church in 704. Two hundred years later, in 909, it became the seat of the newly formed bishopric of Wells; but in 1090, the bishop's seat was removed to Bath. The move caused severe arguments between the canons of Wells and the monks of Bath until 1245 when the bishopric was renamed the Diocese of Bath and Wells, to be elected by both religious houses. With the construction of the current cathedral and the bishop's palace in the first half of the 13th century, under the direction of Bishop Reginald and later Bishop Jocelin, a native of the city, Wells became the principal seat of the diocese.\nThe 8th-century port at Bleadney on the River Axe enabled goods to be brought to within of Wells. In the Middle Ages overseas trade was carried out from the port of Rackley. In the 14th century a French ship sailed up the river, and by 1388 Thomas Tanner from Wells used Rackley to export cloth and corn to Portugal, and received iron and salt in exchange. Wells had been a centre for cloth making; however, in the 16th and 17th centuries this diminished, but the city retained its important market focus. Wells in the 19th century had the largest cheese market in the west of England.\nWells was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \"Welle\", from the Old English , not as a town but as four manors with a population of 132, which implies a population of 500\u2013600. Earlier names for the settlement have been identified which include \"Fontanetum\", in a charter of 725 granted by King Ina to Glastonbury and . \"\"Tidesput\" or \"Tithesput furlang\"\" relates to the area east of the bishop's garden in 1245. Wells was part of, and gave its name to, the hundred of Wells Forum.\nWells had been granted charters to hold markets by Bishop Robert (1136\u201366) and free burgage tenure was granted by Bishop Reginald (1174\u20131191). Wells was recognised as a free borough by a Royal charter of King John in 1201. The city remained under episcopal control until its charter of incorporation from Queen Elizabeth I in 1589. City status was most recently confirmed by Queen Elizabeth II by letters patent issued under the Great Seal dated 1 April 1974, which granted city status specifically to the civil parish; on that date major local government reorganisation came into effect, which involved the abolition of the municipal borough of Wells.\nAnne of Denmark, the wife of King James came to Wells on 20 August 1613. She was entertained by a pageant performed by the town's trades and crafts. The blacksmiths presented Vulcan's forge. The butchers made a tableau of \"old virgins\", with their attires made of cow tails and necklaces made of cow's horns, who were drawn in a chariot by men and boys dressed in ox skins. The mayor, William Bull, held a dinner for members of the queen's household including her four maids of honour. The Venetian ambassador Antonio Foscarini recorded her delight.\nDuring the English Civil War (1642\u20131651), at what became known as the \"Siege of Wells\", the city found itself surrounded by Parliamentarian guns on the Bristol, Glastonbury and Shepton Mallet sides. Col. William Strode had 2,000 men and 150 horse. The Royalists evacuated the city. Parliamentarian troops then used the cathedral to stable their horses and damaged much of the ornate sculpture by using it for firing practice.\nWilliam Penn stayed in Wells shortly before leaving for America (1682), spending a night at The Crown Inn. Here he was briefly arrested for addressing a large crowd in the market place, but released on the intervention of the Bishop of Bath and Wells. During the Monmouth Rebellion (1685) the rebel army attacked the cathedral in an outburst against the established church and damaged the west front. Lead from the roof was used to make bullets, windows were broken, the organ smashed and horses stabled in the nave. Wells was the final location of the Bloody Assizes on 23 September 1685. In a makeshift court lasting only one day, over 500 men were tried and the majority sentenced to death.\nWells first station, Priory Road, opened in 1859 on the Somerset Central Railway (later the Somerset &amp; Dorset Joint Railway, S&amp;DJR) as the terminus of a short branch from Glastonbury. A second railway, the East Somerset, opened a branch line from Witham in 1862 and built Wells East Somerset station to the east of Priory Road. In 1870, the Cheddar Valley line branch of the Bristol &amp; Exeter Railway from Yatton, reached Wells and built a third station at Tucker Street. Matters were simplified when the Great Western Railway acquired the Cheddar Valley and the East Somerset lines and built a link between them that ran through the S&amp;DJR's Priory Road station. In 1878, when through trains began running between Yatton and Witham, the East Somerset station closed, but through trains did not stop at Priory Road until 1934. Priory Road closed to passenger traffic in 1951 when the S&amp;DJR branch line from Glastonbury was shut, though it remained the city's main goods depot. Tucker Street closed in 1963 under the Beeching cuts, which closed the Yatton to Witham line to passengers. Goods traffic to Wells ceased in 1964. Southern Railway West Country class steam locomotive no 34092 was named \"City of Wells\" at a ceremony at Priory Road station in 1949. It was used to haul the \"Golden Arrow\" service between London and Dover. It was withdrawn from service in 1964, and rescued from a scrapyard in 1971, and as August 2021 was operational on the East Lancashire Railway.\nDuring World War II, Stoberry Park in Wells was the location of a prisoner-of-war camp, housing Italian prisoners from the Western Desert Campaign, and later German prisoners after the Battle of Normandy. Penleigh Camp on the Wookey Hole Road was a German working camp.\nGovernance.\nWells City Council is a parish council, with a membership of sixteen councillors, elected from three parish wards. They are (with the number of parish councillors each elects, in brackets): Central (four), St. Thomas' (six) and St. Cuthbert's (six).\nThe civil parish of Wells was formed in 1933 upon the merger of Wells St Cuthbert In and Wells St Andrew (the latter being the historic liberty of the cathedral, the bishop's palace, etc., amounting to just ). Wells is the successor parish for Wells Municipal Borough, which existed from the creation of municipal boroughs in 1835 to their abolition in 1974. The parish has held the city status of Wells since 1 April 1974 (previously held by the municipal borough) and the member of the City Council who chairs the council holds the historic office of Mayor of Wells, typically for one year. The current mayor (for the 2024-25 municipal year) is Councillor Jasmine Browne, who is the 650th Mayor of Wells. She assumed office on 18th May 2024. Another historic position is that of the Town Crier.\nThe City Council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. They also evaluate local planning applications and work with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. This includes city centre management including CCTV, an alcohol ban and regulating street trading permissions including the two funfairs held in the Market Place in May and November each year and the Wells in Bloom competition. The city council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of city facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. They are involved in the management of the Community Sports Development Centre at the Blue School, the skateboard park and allotments in the grounds of the Bishop's Palace, Burcott Road and Barnes Close. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.\nWells Town Hall was built in 1778, with the porch and arcade being added in 1861 and the balcony and round windows in 1932. It is a Grade II listed building. It replaced the former on the site of the Market and Assize Hall in the Market Place, and a Canonical House also known as 'The Exchequer', on the authority of an Act of Parliament dated 1779. The building also houses the magistrates courts and other offices. The Assize court last sat here in October 1970.\nAll other local government services are provided by Somerset Council, a unitary authority established in April 2023. Prior to this date, Wells elected five councillors to Mendip District Council from the same three wards as are used for the City Council (two were returned from St Cuthbert's, two from St Thomas' and one from Central). Wells is an electoral division (with the same boundaries as the civil parish) of Somerset and returns two councillor to Somerset Council, but returned one to its predecessor Somerset County Council. Wells is part of the Wells and Mendip Hills constituency.\nThe Wells city arms show an ash tree surrounded by three water wells, crested with a gold mural crown, with the Latin motto \"Hoc fonte derivata copia\" (translated: \"the fullness that springs from this well\").\nThe council formalised twinning links with Paray-le-Monial, France, and Bad D\u00fcrkheim, Germany in 1979, then added Fontanellato, Italy in 1983; the Wells Twinning Association and the Mayor of Wells organise the twinning activities.\n, Mary Bignal-Rand, Danny Nightingale, The Rifles and the late Harry Patch have the Freedom of the City. The Somerset Light Infantry received the freedom of the City of Wells following their return from Cyprus in 1956.\nCity status.\nAs the seat of an ancient cathedral and diocese, Wells is historically regarded as a city. City status was most recently confirmed by Queen Elizabeth II by letters patent dated 1 April 1974, which granted city status specifically to the civil parish. As the designation is typically awarded to a local council area, this administrative area is then considered to be the formal boundary of the city, including its urban and rural extents. Wells, due to its urban area and wider parish sizes, is near-smallest city on several measures based on 2011 statistics:\nGeography.\nWells lies at the foot of the southern escarpment of the Mendip Hills where they meet the Somerset Levels. The hills are largely made of carboniferous limestone, which is quarried at several nearby sites. In the 1960s, the Mendip television transmitter, was installed on Pen Hill above Wells, approximately from the centre of the city.\nStreams passing through caves on the Mendip Hills, including Thrupe Lane Swallet and Viaduct Sink (approximately east of the city), emerge at Saint Andrew's Well in the garden of the Bishop's Palace, from where the water fills the moat around the Palace and then flows into Keward Brook, which carries it for approximately a mile west to the point where the brook joins the River Sheppey in the village of Coxley.\nAlong with the rest of South West England, the Mendip Hills have a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about with seasonal and diurnal variations, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between . July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around . In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.\nCloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around . About 8\u201315 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest. The predominant wind direction is from the south west.\nThe civil parish of Wells is entirely surrounded by the parish of St Cuthbert Out.\nDemography.\nThe population of the civil parish, recorded in the 2011 census, was 10,536. Of this number 97.5% are ethnically White (with the more specific White British category recorded at 93.5%) and 66.5% described themselves as Christian. The mean average age in 2011 was 41.9 years (the median age being 43).\nEconomy.\nFollowing construction of the A39/A371 bypass, the centre of the city has returned to being that of a quiet market town. It has all the modern conveniences plus shops, hotels and restaurants. Wells is a popular tourist destination, due to its historical sites, its proximity to Bath, Bristol, Stonehenge and Glastonbury and its closeness to the Somerset coast. Also nearby are Wookey Hole Caves, the Mendip Hills and the Somerset Levels. Somerset cheese, including Cheddar, is made locally. Wells is part of the Wells and Shepton Mallet travel to work area which also includes Glastonbury, Cheddar and surrounding areas.\nThe historic part of the city has often been used for filming both documentaries and many period films and television series, including some with very large productions. Recent examples (2014 to 2017) include filming for Series 2 of \"Poldark\", \"Dunkirk\", \"Another Mother's Son\", \"Broadchurch\", \"The Levelling\", \"Mum's List\", and \"The White Princess\". In addition to Wells Cathedral, the Bishop's Palace, Wells is particularly popular among productions, with filming at the latter conducted (in 2015\u20132016) for \"\", \"Galavant\", Terry and Mason's \"The Great British Food Trip\", \"Escape to the Country\", and \"Holiday of My Lifetime\".\nTransport.\nWells is situated at the junction of three numbered routes. The A39 goes north-east to Bath and south-west to Glastonbury and Bridgwater. The A371 goes north-west to Cheddar and Weston-super-Mare, and east to Shepton Mallet. The B3139 goes west to Highbridge, and north-east to Radstock and Trowbridge. The nearest motorway connections are at junction 23 on the M5 via the A39 and at junction 1 of the M32 via the A39 and A37.\nWells is served by First West of England bus services to Bristol and Bristol Temple Meads station, Bath, Frome, Shepton Mallet, Yeovil, Street and Weston-super-Mare, as well as providing some local service. It is served by Berrys Coaches daily Superfast service to and from London. The bus station is in Princes Road. The Mendip Way and Monarch's Way long-distance footpaths pass through the city, as does National Cycle Route 3.\nRailways.\nWells had two stations which were closed by the Beeching Axe in the 1960s: Wells (Tucker Street) railway station and Wells (Priory Road) railway station. The nearest railway line today is the East Somerset Railway.\nThe nearest station today for the national rail network is Castle Cary, away. Bristol Temple Meads railway station is accessible via the 376 bus route; the journey time is around one hour.\nEducation.\nThe Blue School, founded in 1641, is a state coeducational comprehensive school and has been awarded Specialist science college status. It has 1,641 students aged 11\u201318 of both sexes and all ability levels.\nWells Cathedral School, founded in 909, is a private school that has a Christian emphasis and is one of the five established musical schools for school-age children in Britain. The school teaches over 700 pupils between the ages of 3 and 18. The school's boarding houses line the northern parts of the city and the music school retains close links with Wells Cathedral. The primary schools in Wells are Stoberry Park School, St Cuthbert's Church of England Infants School, St Cuthbert's Church of England Junior School and St Joseph and St Teresa Catholic Primary School.\nCulture.\nWells and Mendip Museum includes many historical artefacts from the city and surrounding Mendip Hills. Wells is part of the West Country Carnival circuit.\nhttp:// shows current releases and, in conjunction with the Wells Film Society shows less well known and historical films. The previous cinema, The Regal in Priory Road, closed in 1993 and is now Kudos Nightclub. It was built in 1935 by ES Roberts from Flemish bond brickwork with Art Deco features. It is a Grade II listed building, and was on the Buildings at Risk Register until its restoration which included the restoration and repair of the stained glass fa\u00e7ade. Wells Little Theatre is operated by a voluntary society which started in 1902. In 1969 they took over the old boy's building of Wells Blue School, where they put on a variety of operatic and other productions.\nMilton Lodge is a house overlooking the city. It has a terraced garden, which was laid out in the early 20th century, is listed as Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England.\nLocal media.\nTelevision programmes and local news is provided by BBC West and ITV West Country.\nLocal radio stations are BBC Radio Somerset, Heart West, and Greatest Hits Radio South West.\nThe city is served by these local newspapers: \"Wells Voice\", \"The Somerset County Gazette\" and \"SomersetLive\".\nReligious sites.\nA walled precinct, the Liberty of St Andrew, encloses the twelfth-century Cathedral, the Bishop's Palace, the Vicar's Close, and residences of the clergy who serve the cathedral. Entrances include the Penniless Porch, the Bishop's Eye and Brown's Gatehouse which were all built around 1450.\nThe Church of St Cuthbert has a Somerset stone tower and a carved roof. Originally an Early English building (13th century), it was much altered in the Perpendicular period. The nave's coloured ceiling was repainted in 1963 at the instigation of the then Vicar's wife, Mrs Barnett. Until 1561 the church had a central tower which either collapsed or was removed, and has been replaced with the current tower over the west door. Bells were cast for the tower by Roger Purdy.\nThe polychromatic stone Church of St Thomas was built during 1856 and 1857 and extended by Samuel Sanders Teulon in 1864, commemorating the work of Richard Jenkyns the Dean of Wells who had cared for the poor in the east of the city.\nWells Vineyard Church is an Evangelical Church formed in 2003.\nWells Cathedral.\nThe cathedral is the seat of the Church of England Diocese of Bath and Wells. Wells has been an ecclesiastical city of importance since at least the early 8th century. Parts of the building date back to the tenth century, and it is a grade I listed building. It is known for its fine fan vaulted ceilings, Lady Chapel and windows, and the scissor arches which support the central tower. The west front is said to be the finest collection of statuary in Europe, retaining almost 300 of its original medieval statues, carved from the cathedral's warm, yellow Doulting stone. The Chapter House, at the top of a flight of stone stairs, leading out from the north transept is an octagonal building with a fan-vaulted ceiling. It is here that the business of running the cathedral is still conducted by the members of the Chapter, the cathedral's ruling body. Wells Cathedral clock is famous for its 24-hour astronomical dial and set of jousting knights that perform every quarter-hour. The cathedral has the heaviest ring of ten bells in the world. The tenor bell weighs just over 56\u00a0cwt (6,272\u00a0lb, 2,844\u00a0kg).\nThe Vicars' Close is the oldest residential street in Europe. The Close is tapered by to make it look longer when viewed from the bottom. When viewed from the top, however, it looks shorter. The Old Deanery dates from the 12th century, and St John's Priory from the 14th. The street is owned by Wells Cathedral.\nThe Bishop's Palace.\nThe Bishop's Palace has been the home of the bishops of the Diocese of Bath and Wells for 800 years. The hall and chapel date from the 14th century. There are of gardens including the springs from which the city takes its name. Visitors can also see the Bishop's private chapel, ruined great hall and the gatehouse with portcullis and drawbridge beside which mute swans ring a bell for food. The Bishop's Barn was built in the 15th century.\nSport.\nThe city has two football clubs, one being Wells City F.C., past winners of the Western League. Belrose FC play their football in the Mid-Somerset Football League at Haybridge Park. Wells Cricket Club runs eight sides across senior, junior and women's cricket; they are based at South Horrington. Wells Wanderers Cricket Club are based in Meare. Rowdens Road Cricket Ground was a first-class venue. No longer a cricket ground, it is now occupied in part by Wells FC.\nMid-Somerset Hockey Club and Wells City Acorns Hockey Club both play on the Astroturf pitches at the Blue School, where several other sports clubs are based. Wells Leisure Centre has a swimming pool, gymnasium, sports hall, sauna, steam room, relaxation area and solarium. The 18-hole Wells Golf Club is on the outskirts of the city and also has a 24-bay driving range with optional grass tees.\nIn popular culture.\nElizabeth Goudge used Wells as a basis for the fictional cathedral city of Torminster, in her book \"A City of Bells\" (1936), and its two sequels \"Sister of the Angels\" (1939) and \"Henrietta's House\" (1942: \"The Blue Hills\", USA title).\nWells has been used as the setting for several films including: \"The Canterbury Tales\" (1973), \"A Fistful of Fingers\" (1994), \"The Gathering \" (2003), \"The Libertine\" (2004), \"\" (2007), and \"Hot Fuzz\" (2007, as Sandford). The cathedral interior stood in for Southwark Cathedral during filming for the \"Doctor Who\" episode \"The Lazarus Experiment\", and was also used as an interior location in the film \"Jack the Giant Slayer\" (2013), and in 2017 for the film Hellboy. In 2017 the market square and town hall was used for production of the BBC series Poldark.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, 1/2, 3/2, and 3/8 are dyadic rationals, but 1/3 is not. These numbers are important in computer science because they are the only ones with finite binary representations. Dyadic rationals also have applications in weights and measures, musical time signatures, and early mathematics education. They can accurately approximate any real number.\nThe sum, difference, or product of any two dyadic rational numbers is another dyadic rational number, given by a simple formula. However, division of one dyadic rational number by another does not always produce a dyadic rational result. Mathematically, this means that the dyadic rational numbers form a ring, lying between the ring of integers and the field of rational numbers. This ring may be denoted formula_1.\nIn advanced mathematics, the dyadic rational numbers are central to the constructions of the dyadic solenoid, Minkowski's question-mark function, Daubechies wavelets, Thompson's group, Pr\u00fcfer 2-group, surreal numbers, and fusible numbers. These numbers are order-isomorphic to the rational numbers; they form a subsystem of the 2-adic numbers as well as of the reals, and can represent the fractional parts of 2-adic numbers. Functions from natural numbers to dyadic rationals have been used to formalize mathematical analysis in reverse mathematics.\nApplications.\nIn measurement.\nKitchen weights measuring dyadic fractions of a pound from 2 lb down to 1/64 lb (1/4 oz)\nMany traditional systems of weights and measures are based on the idea of repeated halving, which produces dyadic rationals when measuring fractional amounts of units. The inch is customarily subdivided in dyadic rationals rather than using a decimal subdivision. The customary divisions of the gallon into half-gallons, quarts, pints, and cups are also dyadic. The ancient Egyptians used dyadic rationals in measurement, with denominators up to 64. Similarly, systems of weights from the Indus Valley civilisation are for the most part based on repeated halving; anthropologist Heather M.-L. Miller writes that \"halving is a relatively simple operation with beam balances, which is likely why so many weight systems of this time period used binary systems\".\nIn computing.\nDyadic rationals are central to computer science as a type of fractional number that many computers can manipulate directly. In particular, as a data type used by computers, floating-point numbers are often defined as integers multiplied by positive or negative powers of two. The numbers that can be represented precisely in a floating-point format, such as the IEEE floating-point datatypes, are called its representable numbers. For most floating-point representations, the representable numbers are a subset of the dyadic rationals. The same is true for fixed-point datatypes, which also use powers of two implicitly in the majority of cases. Because of the simplicity of computing with dyadic rationals, they are also used for exact real computing using interval arithmetic, and are central to some theoretical models of computable numbers.\nGenerating a random variable from random bits, in a fixed amount of time, is possible only when the variable has finitely many outcomes whose probabilities are all dyadic rational numbers. For random variables whose probabilities are not dyadic, it is necessary either to approximate their probabilities by dyadic rationals, or to use a random generation process whose time is itself random and unbounded.\nIn music.\n&lt;score sound=\"1\"&gt; { \\new PianoStaff \u00ab \\new Staff \\relative c\" { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"violin\" \\clef treble \\tempo 8 = 126 \\time 3/16 r16 &lt;d c a fis d&gt;\\f-! r16\\fermata Five bars from Igor Stravinski's \"The Rite of Spring\"showing time signatures , , , and \nTime signatures in Western musical notation traditionally are written in a form resembling fractions (for example: , , or ), although the horizontal line of the musical staff that separates the top and bottom number is usually omitted when writing the signature separately from its staff. As fractions they are generally dyadic, although non-dyadic time signatures have also been used. The numeric value of the signature, interpreted as a fraction, describes the length of a measure as a fraction of a whole note. Its numerator describes the number of beats per measure, and the denominator describes the length of each beat.\nIn mathematics education.\nIn theories of childhood development of the concept of a fraction based on the work of Jean Piaget, fractional numbers arising from halving and repeated halving are among the earliest forms of fractions to develop. This stage of development of the concept of fractions has been called \"algorithmic halving\". Addition and subtraction of these numbers can be performed in steps that only involve doubling, halving, adding, and subtracting integers. In contrast, addition and subtraction of more general fractions involves integer multiplication and factorization to reach a common denominator. Therefore, dyadic fractions can be easier for students to calculate with than more general fractions.\nDefinitions and arithmetic.\nThe dyadic numbers are the rational numbers that result from dividing an integer by a power of two. A rational number formula_2 in simplest terms is a dyadic rational when formula_3 is a power of two. Another equivalent way of defining the dyadic rationals is that they are the real numbers that have a terminating binary representation.\nAddition, subtraction, and multiplication of any two dyadic rationals produces another dyadic rational, according to the following formulas:\n formula_4\nHowever, the result of dividing one dyadic rational by another is not necessarily a dyadic rational. For instance, 1 and 3 are both dyadic rational numbers, but 1/3 is not.\nAdditional properties.\nEvery integer, and every half-integer, is a dyadic rational. They both meet the definition of being an integer divided by a power of two: every integer is an integer divided by one (the zeroth power of two), and every half-integer is an integer divided by two.\nEvery real number can be arbitrarily closely approximated by dyadic rationals. In particular, for a real number formula_5, consider the dyadic rationals of the form where formula_6 can be any integer and formula_7 denotes the floor function that rounds its argument down to an integer. These numbers approximate formula_5 from below to within an error of formula_9, which can be made arbitrarily small by choosing formula_6 to be arbitrarily large. For a fractal subset of the real numbers, this error bound is within a constant factor of optimal: for these numbers, there is no approximation formula_11 with error smaller than a constant times formula_9. The existence of accurate dyadic approximations can be expressed by saying that the set of all dyadic rationals is dense in the real line. More strongly, this set is uniformly dense, in the sense that the dyadic rationals with denominator formula_13 are uniformly spaced on the real line.\nThe dyadic rationals are precisely those numbers possessing finite binary expansions. Their binary expansions are not unique; there is one finite and one infinite representation of each dyadic rational other than 0 (ignoring terminal 0s). For example, 0.112 = 0.10111...2, giving two different representations for 3/4. The dyadic rationals are the only numbers whose binary expansions are not unique.\nIn advanced mathematics.\nAlgebraic structure.\nBecause they are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication, but not division, the dyadic rationals are a ring but not a field. The ring of dyadic rationals may be denoted formula_1, meaning that it can be generated by evaluating polynomials with integer coefficients, at the argument 1/2. As a ring, the dyadic rationals are a subring of the rational numbers, and an overring of the integers. Algebraically, this ring is the localization of the integers with respect to the set of powers of two.\nAs well as forming a subring of the real numbers, the dyadic rational numbers form a subring of the 2-adic numbers, a system of numbers that can be defined from binary representations that are finite to the right of the binary point but may extend infinitely far to the left. The 2-adic numbers include all rational numbers, not just the dyadic rationals. Embedding the dyadic rationals into the 2-adic numbers does not change the arithmetic of the dyadic rationals, but it gives them a different topological structure than they have as a subring of the real numbers. As they do in the reals, the dyadic rationals form a dense subset of the 2-adic numbers, and are the set of 2-adic numbers with finite binary expansions. Every 2-adic number can be decomposed into the sum of a 2-adic integer and a dyadic rational; in this sense, the dyadic rationals can represent the fractional parts of 2-adic numbers, but this decomposition is not unique.\nAddition of dyadic rationals modulo 1 (the quotient group formula_15 of the dyadic rationals by the integers) forms the Pr\u00fcfer 2-group.\nDyadic solenoid.\nConsidering only the addition and subtraction operations of the dyadic rationals gives them the structure of an additive abelian group. Pontryagin duality is a method for understanding abelian groups by constructing dual groups, whose elements are characters of the original group, group homomorphisms to the multiplicative group of the complex numbers, with pointwise multiplication as the dual group operation. The dual group of the additive dyadic rationals, constructed in this way, can also be viewed as a topological group. It is called the dyadic solenoid, and is isomorphic to the topological product of the real numbers and 2-adic numbers, quotiented by the diagonal embedding of the dyadic rationals into this product. It is an example of a protorus, a solenoid, and an indecomposable continuum.\nFunctions with dyadic rationals as distinguished points.\nBecause they are a dense subset of the real numbers, the dyadic rationals, with their numeric ordering, form a dense order. As with any two unbounded countable dense linear orders, by Cantor's isomorphism theorem, the dyadic rationals are order-isomorphic to the rational numbers. In this case, Minkowski's question-mark function provides an order-preserving bijection between the set of all rational numbers and the set of dyadic rationals.\nThe dyadic rationals play a key role in the analysis of Daubechies wavelets, as the set of points where the scaling function of these wavelets is non-smooth. Similarly, the dyadic rationals parameterize the discontinuities in the boundary between stable and unstable points in the parameter space of the H\u00e9non map.\nThe set of piecewise linear homeomorphisms from the unit interval to itself that have power-of-2 slopes and dyadic-rational breakpoints forms a group under the operation of function composition. This is Thompson's group, the first known example of an infinite but finitely presented simple group. The same group can also be represented by an action on rooted binary trees, or by an action on the dyadic rationals within the unit interval.\nOther related constructions.\nIn reverse mathematics, one way of constructing the real numbers is to represent them as functions from unary numbers to dyadic rationals, where the value of one of these functions for the argument formula_6 is a dyadic rational with denominator formula_13 that approximates the given real number. Defining real numbers in this way allows many of the basic results of mathematical analysis to be proven within a restricted theory of second-order arithmetic called \"feasible analysis\" (BTFA).\nThe surreal numbers are generated by an iterated construction principle which starts by generating all finite dyadic rationals, and then goes on to create new and strange kinds of infinite, infinitesimal and other numbers. This number system is foundational to combinatorial game theory, and dyadic rationals arise naturally in this theory as the set of values of certain combinatorial games.\nThe fusible numbers are a subset of the dyadic rationals, the closure of the set formula_18 under the operation formula_19, restricted to pairs formula_20 with formula_21. They are well-ordered, with order type equal to the epsilon number formula_22. For each integer formula_23 the smallest fusible number that is greater than formula_23 has the form formula_25. The existence of formula_26 for each formula_23 cannot be proven in Peano arithmetic, and formula_26 grows so rapidly as a function of formula_23 that for formula_30 it is (in Knuth's up-arrow notation for large numbers) already larger than formula_31.\nThe usual proof of Urysohn's lemma utilizes the dyadic fractions for constructing the separating function from the lemma.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;/math&gt;.

Within the thymus, T cells mature. T cells are critical to the adaptive immune system, where the body adapts to specific foreign invaders. The thymus is located in the upper front part of the chest, in the anterior superior mediastinum, behind the sternum, and in front of the heart. It is made up of two lobes, each consisting of a central medulla and an outer cortex, surrounded by a capsule.\nThe thymus is made up of immature T cells called thymocytes, as well as lining cells called epithelial cells which help the thymocytes develop. T cells that successfully develop react appropriately with MHC immune receptors of the body (called \"positive selection\") and not against proteins of the body (called \"negative selection\"). The thymus is the largest and most active during the neonatal and pre-adolescent periods. By the early teens, the thymus begins to decrease in size and activity and the tissue of the thymus is gradually replaced by fatty tissue. Nevertheless, some T cell development continues throughout adult life.\nAbnormalities of the thymus can result in a decreased number of T cells and autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 and myasthenia gravis. These are often associated with cancer of the tissue of the thymus, called thymoma, or tissues arising from immature lymphocytes such as T cells, called lymphoma. Removal of the thymus is called a thymectomy. Although the thymus has been identified as a part of the body since the time of the Ancient Greeks, it is only since the 1960s that the function of the thymus in the immune system has become clearer.\nStructure.\nThe thymus is an organ that sits behind the sternum in the upper front part of the chest, stretching upwards towards the neck. In children, the thymus is pinkish-gray, soft, and lobulated on its surfaces. At birth, it is about 4\u20136\u00a0cm long, 2.5\u20135\u00a0cm wide, and about 1\u00a0cm thick. It increases in size until puberty, where it may have a size of about 40\u201350\u00a0g, following which it decreases in size in a process known as involution.\nThe thymus is located in the anterior mediastinum. It is made up of two lobes that meet in the upper midline, and stretch from below the thyroid in the neck to as low as the cartilage of the fourth rib. The lobes are covered by a capsule. The thymus lies behind the sternum, rests on the pericardium, and is separated from the aortic arch and great vessels by a layer of fascia. The left brachiocephalic vein may even be embedded within the thymus. In the neck, it lies on the front and sides of the trachea, behind the sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles.\nMicroanatomy.\nThe thymus consists of two lobes, merged in the middle, surrounded by a capsule that extends with blood vessels into the interior. The lobes consist of an outer rich with cells and an inner less dense . The lobes are divided into smaller lobules 0.5-2 mm diameter, between which extrude radiating insertions from the capsule along .\nThe cortex is mainly made up of thymocytes and epithelial cells. The thymocytes, immature T cells, are supported by a network of the finely-branched epithelial reticular cells, which is continuous with a similar network in the medulla. This network forms an adventitia to the blood vessels, which enter the cortex via septa near the junction with the medulla. Other cells are also present in the thymus, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and a small amount of B cells, neutrophils and eosinophils.\nIn the medulla, the network of epithelial cells is coarser than in the cortex, and the lymphoid cells are relatively fewer in number. Concentric, nest-like bodies called Hassall's corpuscles (also called \"thymic corpuscles\") are formed by aggregations of the medullary epithelial cells. These are concentric, layered whorls of epithelial cells that increase in number throughout life. They are the remains of the epithelial tubes, which grow out from the third pharyngeal pouches of the embryo to form the thymus.\nBlood and nerve supply.\nThe arteries supplying the thymus are branches of the internal thoracic, and inferior thyroid arteries, with branches from the superior thyroid artery sometimes seen. The branches reach the thymus and travel with the septa of the capsule into the area between the cortex and medulla, where they enter the thymus itself; or alternatively directly enter the capsule.\nThe veins of the thymus, the thymic veins, end in the left brachiocephalic vein, internal thoracic vein, and in the inferior thyroid veins. Sometimes the veins end directly in the superior vena cava.\nLymphatic vessels travel only away from the thymus, accompanying the arteries and veins. These drain into the brachiocephalic, tracheobronchial and parasternal lymph nodes.\nThe nerves supplying the thymus arise from the vagus nerve and the cervical sympathetic chain. Branches from the phrenic nerves reach the capsule of the thymus, but do not enter into the thymus itself.\nVariation.\nThe two lobes differ slightly in size, with the left lobe usually higher than the right. Thymic tissue may be found scattered on or around the gland, and occasionally within the thyroid. The thymus in children stretches variably upwards, at times to as high as the thyroid gland.\nDevelopment.\nThe thymocytes and the epithelium of the thymus have different developmental origins. The epithelium of the thymus develops first, appearing as two outgrowths, one on either side, of the third pharyngeal pouch. It sometimes also involves the fourth pharyngeal pouch. These extend outward and backward into the surrounding mesoderm and neural crest-derived mesenchyme in front of the ventral aorta. Here the thymocytes and epithelium meet and join with connective tissue. The pharyngeal opening of each diverticulum is soon obliterated, but the neck of the flask persists for some time as a cellular cord. By further proliferation of the cells lining the flask, buds of cells are formed, which become surrounded and isolated by the invading mesoderm.\nThe epithelium forms fine lobules, and develops into a sponge-like structure. During this stage, hematopoietic bone-marrow precursors migrate into the thymus. Normal development is dependent on the interaction between the epithelium and the hematopoietic thymocytes. Iodine is also necessary for thymus development and activity.\nInvolution.\nThe thymus continues to grow after birth reaching the relative maximum size by puberty. It is most active in fetal and neonatal life. It increases to a mass of 20 to 50 grams by puberty. It then begins to decrease in size and activity in a process called thymic involution. After the first year of life the amount of T cells produced begins to fall. Fat and connective tissue fill a part of the thymic volume. During involution, the thymus decreases in size and activity. Fat cells are present at birth, but increase in size and number markedly after puberty, invading the gland from the walls between the lobules first, then into the cortex and medulla. This process continues into old age, where whether with a microscope or with the human eye, the thymus may be difficult to detect, although typically weighs 5\u201315 grams. Additionally, there is an increasing body of evidence showing that age-related thymic involution is found in most, if not all, vertebrate species with a thymus, suggesting that this is an evolutionary process that has been conserved.]\nThe atrophy is due to the increased circulating level of sex hormones, and chemical or physical castration of an adult results in the thymus increasing in size and activity. Severe illness or human immunodeficiency virus infection may also result in involution.\nFunction.\nT cell maturation.\nThe thymus facilitates the maturation of T cells, an important part of the immune system providing cell-mediated immunity. T cells begin as hematopoietic precursors from the bone-marrow, and migrate to the thymus, where they are referred to as thymocytes. In the thymus, they undergo a process of maturation, which involves ensuring the cells react against antigens (\"positive selection\"), but that they do not react against antigens found on body tissue (\"negative selection\"). Once mature, T cells emigrate from the thymus to provide vital functions in the immune system.\nEach T cell has a distinct T cell receptor, suited to a specific substance, called an antigen. Most T cell receptors bind to the major histocompatibility complex on cells of the body. The MHC presents an antigen to the T cell receptor, which becomes active if this matches the specific T cell receptor. In order to be properly functional, a mature T cell needs to be able to bind to the MHC molecule (\"positive selection\"), and not to react against antigens that are actually from the tissues of body (\"negative selection\"). Positive selection occurs in the cortex and negative selection occurs in the medulla of the thymus. After this process T cells that have survived leave the thymus, regulated by sphingosine-1-phosphate. Further maturation occurs in the peripheral circulation. Some of this is because of hormones and cytokines secreted by cells within the thymus, including thymulin, thymopoietin, and thymosins.\nPositive selection.\nT cells have distinct T cell receptors. These distinct receptors are formed by process of V(D)J recombination gene rearrangement stimulated by RAG1 and RAG2 genes. This process is error-prone, and some thymocytes fail to make functional T-cell receptors, whereas other thymocytes make T-cell receptors that are autoreactive. If a functional T cell receptor is formed, the thymocyte will begin to express simultaneously the cell surface proteins CD4 and CD8.\nThe survival and nature of the T cell then depends on its interaction with surrounding thymic epithelial cells. Here, the T cell receptor interacts with the MHC molecules on the surface of epithelial cells. A T cell with a receptor that doesn't react, or reacts weakly, will die by apoptosis. A T cell that does react will survive and proliferate. A mature T cell expresses only CD4 or CD8, but not both. This depends on the strength of binding between the TCR and MHC class 1 or class 2. A T cell receptor that binds mostly to MHC class I tends to produce a mature \"cytotoxic\" CD8 positive T cell; a T cell receptor that binds mostly to MHC class II tends to produce a CD4 positive T cell.\nNegative selection.\nT cells that attack the body's own proteins are eliminated in the thymus, called \"negative selection\". Epithelial cells in the medulla and dendritic cells in the thymus express major proteins from elsewhere in the body. The gene that stimulates this is AIRE. Thymocytes that react strongly to self antigens do not survive, and die by apoptosis. Some CD4 positive T cells exposed to self antigens persist as T regulatory cells.\nClinical significance.\nImmunodeficiency.\nAs the thymus is where T cells develop, congenital problems with the development of the thymus can lead to immunodeficiency, whether because of a problem with the development of the thymus gland, or a problem specific to thymocyte development. Immunodeficiency can be profound. Loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation (as in DiGeorge syndrome, CHARGE syndrome, or a very rare \"nude\" thymus causing absence of hair and the thymus) results in severe immunodeficiency and subsequent high susceptibility to infection by viruses, protozoa, and fungi. Nude mice with the very rare \"nude\" deficiency as a result of FOXN1 mutation are a strain of research mice as a model of T cell deficiency.\nThe most common congenital cause of thymus-related immune deficiency results from the deletion of the 22nd chromosome, called DiGeorge syndrome. This results in a failure of development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches, resulting in failure of development of the thymus, and variable other associated problems, such as congenital heart disease, and abnormalities of mouth (such as cleft palate and cleft lip), failure of development of the parathyroid glands, and the presence of a fistula between the trachea and the oesophagus. Very low numbers of circulating T cells are seen. The condition is diagnosed by fluorescent in situ hybridization and treated with thymus transplantation.\nSevere combined immunodeficiency (SCID) are group of rare congenital genetic diseases that can result in combined T, B, and NK cell deficiencies. These syndromes are caused by mutations that affect the maturation of the hematopoietic progenitor cells, which are the precursors of both B and T cells. A number of genetic defects can cause SCID, including IL-2 receptor gene loss of function, and mutation resulting in deficiency of the enzyme adenine deaminase.\nAutoimmune disease.\nAutoimmune polyendocrine syndrome.\nAutoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 is a rare genetic autoimmune syndrome that results from a genetic defect of the thymus tissues. Specifically, the disease results from defects in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene, which stimulates expression of self antigens in the epithelial cells within the medulla of the thymus. Because of defects in this condition, self antigens are not expressed, resulting in T cells that are not conditioned to tolerate tissues of the body, and may treat them as foreign, stimulating an immune response and resulting in autoimmunity. People with APECED develop an autoimmune disease that affects multiple endocrine tissues, with the commonly affected organs being hypothyroidism of the thyroid gland, Addison's disease of the adrenal glands, and candida infection of body surfaces including the inner lining of the mouth and of the nails due to dysfunction of TH17 cells, and symptoms often beginning in childhood. Many other autoimmune diseases may also occur. Treatment is directed at the affected organs.\nThymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity.\nThymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity can occur in people with thymoma. In this condition, the T cells developed in the thymus are directed against the tissues of the body. This is because the malignant thymus is incapable of appropriately educating developing thymocytes to eliminate self-reactive T cells. The condition is virtually indistinguishable from graft versus host disease.\nMyasthenia gravis.\nMyasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease most often due to antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors, involved in signalling between nerves and muscles. It is often associated with thymic hyperplasia or thymoma, with antibodies produced probably because of T cells that develop abnormally. Myasthenia gravis most often develops between young and middle age, causing easy fatiguing of muscle movements. Investigations include demonstrating antibodies (such as against acetylcholine receptors or muscle-specific kinase), and CT scan to detect thymoma or thymectomy. With regard to the thymus, removal of the thymus, called thymectomy may be considered as a treatment, particularly if a thymoma is found. Other treatments include increasing the duration of acetylcholine action at nerve synapses by decreasing the rate of breakdown. This is done by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine.\nCancer.\nThymomas.\nTumours originating from the thymic epithelial cells are called thymomas. They most often occur in adults older than 40. Tumours are generally detected when they cause symptoms, such as a neck mass or affecting nearby structures such as the superior vena cava; detected because of screening in patients with myasthenia gravis, which has a strong association with thymomas and hyperplasia; and detected as an incidental finding on imaging such as chest X-rays. Hyperplasia and tumours originating from the thymus are associated with other autoimmune diseases \u2013 such as hypogammaglobulinemia, Graves disease, pure red cell aplasia, pernicious anaemia and dermatomyositis, likely because of defects in negative selection in proliferating T cells.\nThymomas can be benign; benign but by virtue of expansion, invading beyond the capsule of the thymus (\"invasive thymoma\"), or malignant (a carcinoma). This classification is based on the appearance of the cells. A WHO classification also exists but is not used as part of standard clinical practice. Benign tumours confined to the thymus are most common; followed by locally invasive tumours, and then by carcinomas. There is variation in reporting, with some sources reporting malignant tumours as more common. Invasive tumours, although not technically malignant, can still spread () to other areas of the body. Even though thymomas occur of epithelial cells, they can also contain thymocytes. Treatment of thymomas often requires surgery to remove the entire thymus. This may also result in temporary remission of any associated autoimmune conditions.\nLymphomas.\nTumours originating from T cells of the thymus form a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). These are similar in symptoms, investigation approach and management to other forms of ALL. Symptoms that develop, like other forms of ALL, relate to deficiency of platelets, resulting in bruising or bleeding; immunosuppression resulting in infections; or infiltration by cells into parts of the body, resulting in an enlarged liver, spleen, lymph nodes or other sites. Blood test might reveal a large amount of white blood cells or lymphoblasts, and deficiency in other cell lines \u2013 such as low platelets or anaemia. Immunophenotyping will reveal cells that are CD3, a protein found on T cells, and help further distinguish the maturity of the T cells. Genetic analysis including karyotyping may reveal specific abnormalities that may influence prognosis or treatment, such as the Philadelphia translocation. Management can include multiple courses of chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, and management of associated problems, such as treatment of infections with antibiotics, and blood transfusions. Very high white cell counts may also require cytoreduction with apheresis.\nTumours originating from the small population of B cells present in the thymus lead to primary mediastinal large B cell lymphomas. These are a rare subtype of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, although by the activity of genes and occasionally microscopic shape, unusually they also have the characteristics of Hodgkin lymphomas. that occur most commonly in young and middle-aged, more prominent in females. Most often, when symptoms occur it is because of compression of structures near the thymus, such as the superior vena cava or the upper respiratory tract; when lymph nodes are affected it is often in the mediastinum and neck groups. Such tumours are often detected with a biopsy that is subject to immunohistochemistry. This will show the presence of clusters of differentiation, cell surface proteins \u2013 namely CD30, with CD19, CD20 and CD22, and with the absence of CD15. Other markers may also be used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment usually includes the typical regimens of CHOP or EPOCH or other regimens; regimens generally including cyclophosphamide, an anthracycline, prednisone, and other chemotherapeutics; and potentially also a stem cell transplant.\nThymic cysts.\nThe thymus may contain cysts, usually less than 4\u00a0cm in diameter. Thymic cysts are usually detected incidentally and do not generally cause symptoms. Thymic cysts can occur along the neck or in the chest (mediastinum). Cysts usually just contain fluid and are lined by either many layers of flat cells or column-shaped cells. Despite this, the presence of a cyst can cause problems similar to those of thymomas, by compressing nearby structures, and some may contact internal walls () and be difficult to distinguish from tumours. When cysts are found, investigation may include a workup for tumours, which may include CT or MRI scan of the area the cyst is suspected to be in.\nSurgical removal.\nThymectomy is the surgical removal of the thymus. The usual reason for removal is to gain access to the heart for surgery to correct congenital heart defects in the neonatal period. Other indications for thymectomy include the removal of thymomas and the treatment of myasthenia gravis. In neonates the relative size of the thymus obstructs surgical access to the heart and its surrounding vessels. \nRemoval of the thymus in infancy results in often fatal immunodeficiency, because functional T cells have not developed. In older children and adults, which have a functioning lymphatic system with mature T cells also situated in other lymphoid organs, the effect is reduced, but includes failure to mount immune responses against new antigens, an increase in cancers, and an increase in all-cause mortality.\nSociety and culture.\nWhen used as food for humans, the thymus of animals is known as one of the kinds of sweetbread.\nHistory.\nThe thymus was known to the ancient Greeks, and its name comes from the herb \"thyme\" (in Greek: \u03b8\u03cd\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2), which became the name for a \"warty excrescence\", possibly due to its resemblance to a bunch of thyme.\nGalen was the first to note that the size of the organ changed over the duration of a person's life.\nIn the 19th century, a condition was identified as \"status thymicolymphaticus\" defined by an increase in lymphoid tissue and an enlarged thymus. It was thought to be a cause of sudden infant death syndrome but is now an obsolete term.\nThe importance of the thymus in the immune system was discovered in 1961 by Jacques Miller, by surgically removing the thymus from one-day-old mice, and observing the subsequent deficiency in a lymphocyte population, subsequently named T cells after the organ of their origin. Until the discovery of its immunological role, the thymus had been dismissed as an \"evolutionary accident\", without functional importance. The role the thymus played in ensuring mature T cells tolerated the tissues of the body was uncovered in 1962, with the finding that T cells of a transplanted thymus in mice demonstrated tolerance towards tissues of the donor mouse. B cells and T cells were identified as different types of lymphocytes in 1968, and the fact that T cells required maturation in the thymus was understood. The subtypes of T cells (CD8 and CD4) were identified by 1975. The way that these subclasses of T cells matured \u2013 positive selection of cells that functionally bound to MHC receptors \u2013 was known by the 1990s. The important role of the AIRE gene, and the role of negative selection in preventing autoreactive T cells from maturing, was understood by 1994.\nRecently, advances in immunology have allowed the function of the thymus in T-cell maturation to be more fully understood.\nOther animals.\nThe thymus is present in all jawed vertebrates, where it undergoes the same shrinkage with age and plays the same immunological function as in other vertebrates. Recently, in 2011, a discrete thymus-like lympho-epithelial structure, termed the \"thymoid\", was discovered in the gills of larval lampreys. Hagfish possess a protothymus associated with the pharyngeal velar muscles, which is responsible for a variety of immune responses.\nThe thymus is also present in most other vertebrates with similar structure and function as the human thymus. A second thymus in the neck has been reported sometimes to occur in the mouse. As in humans, the guinea pig's thymus naturally atrophies as the animal reaches adulthood, but the athymic hairless guinea pig (which arose from a spontaneous laboratory mutation) possesses no thymic tissue whatsoever, and the organ cavity is replaced with cystic spaces.\nReferences.\n \"This article incorporates text in the public domain from the 20th edition of\" Gray's Anatomy \"(1918)\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It contained what are now Indonesia's six easternmost provinces, Central Papua, Highland Papua, Papua, South Papua, Southwest Papua, and West Papua, which were administered as a single province prior to 2003 under the name \"Irian Jaya\", and now comprise the Papua region of the country.\nDuring the Indonesian Revolution, the Dutch launched to capture territory from the Indonesian Republic. The harsh methods of the Dutch drew international disapproval. With international opinion shifting towards support of the Indonesian Republic, the Dutch managed in 1949 to negotiate for the separation of Dutch New Guinea from the broader Indonesian settlement, with the fate of the disputed territory to be decided by the close of 1950. The Dutch in the coming years stated at the UN that the indigenous population of Dutch New Guinea represented a separate ethnic group from the people of Indonesia and thus should not be absorbed into the Indonesian state. The Indonesian Republic, as successor state to the Netherlands East Indies, claimed Dutch New Guinea as part of its natural territorial bounds. The dispute over New Guinea was an important factor in the quick decline in bilateral relations between the Netherlands and Indonesia after Indonesian independence. The dispute escalated into low-level conflict in 1962 following Dutch moves in 1961 to establish a New Guinea Council.\nFollowing the Vlakke Hoek incident, Indonesia launched a campaign of infiltrations designed to place pressure on the Dutch. Facing diplomatic pressure from the United States, fading domestic support and continual Indonesian threats to invade the territory, the Netherlands decided to relinquish control of the disputed territory in August 1962, agreeing to the Bunker Proposal on condition that a referendum to determine the final fate of the territory be conducted at a later date. The territory was administered by the UN temporarily before being transferred to Indonesia on 1 May 1963. A plebiscite, the Act of Free Choice, was eventually held in 1969, but the fairness of the election is disputed.\nPre-World War II.\nBefore 1898, Papuans lived in isolated, competitive, and autonomous clan and tribal environments. In 1898, the Dutch came and established their presence. Their claim, which was made in 1848, was based on the Sultanate of Ternate's claim on Papua based on Ternatean tributary relation. The Dutch first divided Papua into two afdeelings: Afdeeling Noord-Nieuw-Guinea (Manokwari), and Afdeeling West-En-Zuid-Nieuw-Guinea (Fakfak), both led by controleurs under the Residentie Ternate. The afdeelings were led by controleurs normally responsible for onderafdeeling instead of the usual asistent-resident due to newly established nature of the land. The colonial government set Tanjung Goede Hoop or Jamoer Seba (Yamursba) as the boundary of the two afdeeling\nIn 1901 to subdue the headhunting Ugeris and increase colonial control, Afdeeling West-En-Zuid-Nieuw-Guinea was split into Afdeeling West-Nieuw-Guinea and Afdeeling Zuid-New-Guinea. Afdeeling West-Nieuw-Guinea consisted of the part of Dutch New Guinea from Cape Jamoer Seba to Cape Steenboom and surrounding islands, including the group of Radja Ampat, under a Controller at Fakfak. While Afdeeling Zuid-New-Guinea consisted of the part of Dutch New Guinea from Cape Steenboom to the mouth of the Bensbach river and surrounding islands, under an assistent-resident with a to be determined capital. Later it would be Merauke which was founded on 12 February 1902 for the express purpose of being the capital.\nSince their creation, Afdeeling West-Nieuw-Guinea would remain part of the Residentie Ternate until it was transferred into Residentie Amboina in 1911. While the Afdeeling Zuid-Nieuw-Guinea would be an independent afdeeling until it was put under Residentie Amboina in 1913.\nIn 1920, the three Afdeelings were made into its own residentie Nieuw Guinea. However it did not last as in August 1923 the Governor-General decided to merge the residency into Residentie Amboina. It followed the fate of Residentie Ternate which was also merged into Residentie Amboina in 1922. The merging process was done on 1 April 1924. The Afdeelings themselves were kept the same at the time.\nIn 1925, the status of the Residentie Amboina was upgraded to the Gouvernement der Molukken, which was divided into two residencies, namely Residentie Amboina and Residentie Ternate. Six onderafdeelings of New Guinea (Manokwari, Sorong, Schouteneilanden, Jappengroep, Hollandia dan West-Nieuw Guinea) were under the Residentie Ternate. While only one, the Onderafdeeling of Zuid-Nieuw Guinea was under the Residentie Amboina. The reduction in the status of the three afdeelings in Papua to onderafdeeling, and before that the Residentie Nieuw Guinea into Amboina, was caused by the decline in the regional income since the ban of hunting Cendrawasih in 1922.\nIn 1934, the status of the Gouvernement der Molukken was downgraded into Residentie der Molukken. The residency oversaw Afdeeling Ternate, Ambon, Tual, and North and West New Guinea. The Onderafdeeling Zuid-Nieuw-Guinea and Onderafdeeling Boven Digul were placed under Afdeeling Tual. Afdeeling Noord-Nieuw-Guinea and Afdeeling West-Nieuw-Guinea were combined into one afdeeling called Afdeeling Noord-En-West-New Guinea which oversaw 5 onderafdeeling namely Manokwari, Sorong, Serui, Hollandia and Fak-Fak.\nIn 1936 the Dutch colonial government shuffled a new territorial division in the residency. The residency was divided into two afdeelings, namely the Afdeeling Noord-Nieuw-Guinea which oversaw 5 onderafdeelings (Manokwari, Sorong, Central Vogelkop, Serui and Hollandia); and the West-En-Zuid-Nieuw Guinea Afdeeling also oversaw 5 onderafdeeling (Fak-Fak, Inanwatan, Mimika, Boven Digul and South Nieuw Guinea)\nIn 1937 Onderafdeeling Boven Digul and Onderafdeeling Zuid-Nieuw-Guinea were placed back under Afdeeling Tual. The Afdeeling West-Niuew-Guinea was separated from the afdeeling of Zuid-Niuew-Guinea. Both Afdeling Noord-Niuew-Guinea and Afdeling West-Niuew-Guinea oversaw 4 onderafdeeling each. Afdeling North New Guinea oversaw Fak-Fak, Central Vogelkop, Inanwatan and Mimika, while Afdeeling West New Guinea oversaw Manokwari, Sorong, Serui and Hollandia. The return of West Guinea's Afdeeling status was related to the increase in private oil exploration activities carried out by the Nederlandsche Nieuw Guinea Petroleum Maatschappij (NNGPM) in Babo which began its activities in New Guinea on 23 April 1935.\nIn 1938, Gouvernement Groote Oost was created to encompass all Dutch East Indies residencies east of Java and Kalimantan.\nIn 1940 there was another shuffle, and Afdeeling Noord-Niuew-Guinea oversaw five onderafdeeling, namely Manokwari, Sorong, Serui, Sarmi and Hollandia. West New Guinea included three onderafdeelings, namely Fak-Fak, Inanwatan and Mimika. While Onderafdeeling Boven Digul and Onderafdeeling Zuid-Nieuw-Guinea were placed under Afdeeling of Tual.\nUntil after World War II, the western part of the island of New Guinea was part of the Great East (\"Groote Oost\") governorate of the Dutch East Indies. The Netherlands claimed sovereignty over New Guinea within the colony through its protection over the Sultanate of Tidore, a sultanate on an island west of Halmahera in the Maluku Islands. In a 1660 treaty, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) recognised the Sultanate of Tidore's supremacy over the Papuan people, the inhabitants of New Guinea. Probably this referred to some Papuan islands (Raja Ampat) near the Maluku Islands as well as coastal areas like Fakfak, through familial relations with local rulers, although Tidore never exercised actual control over the interior and highlands of New Guinea. In 1872, Tidore recognised Dutch sovereignty and granted permission to the Kingdom of the Netherlands to establish administration in its territories whenever the Netherlands Indies authorities would want to do so. This allowed the Netherlands to legitimise a claim to the New Guinea area.\nThe Dutch established the 141st meridian as the eastern frontier of the territory. In 1898, the Netherlands Indies government decided to establish administrative posts in Fakfak and Manokwari, followed by Merauke in 1902. The main reason for this was the expansion of British and German interests in the east. The Dutch wanted to make sure the United Kingdom and Germany would not move the border to the west. This resulted in the partition of the island of New Guinea.\nIn reality, most of New Guinea remained outside colonial influence. Little was known about the interior; large areas on the map were white and the number of inhabitants of the island was unknown, and numerous explorations were made into the interior from the turn of the 20th century on. The indigenous inhabitants of New Guinea were Papuans, living in tribes. They were hunter-gatherers.\nPre-World War II economic activity was limited. Only coastal and island dwellers traded to some extent, mostly with the Maluku Islands. A development company was founded in 1938 to change this situation, but it was not very active. So, until World War II, New Guinea was a disregarded and unimportant territory within the Netherlands Indies.\nHomeland for the Eurasians.\nThe group that was most interested in New Guinea before the war were the Eurasians or Indo people. Before the war, some 150,000 to 200,000 Eurasians were living in the Netherlands Indies. They were of mixed European and Indonesian descent and identified with the Netherlands and the Dutch way of life. In the colonial society of the Netherlands Indies, they held a higher social status than indigenous Indonesians (\"inlanders\"). They were mostly employed as office workers. As the educational level of indigenous Indonesians was on the rise, more and more Indonesians got jobs previously held by Eurasians. These had no other means of making a living, because, as Europeans, they were forbidden to buy land on Java. This situation caused mental and economic problems to the Eurasians. In 1923, the first plan to designate New Guinea as a settlement territory for Eurasians was devised. In 1926, a separate \"Vereniging tot Kolonisatie van Nieuw-Guinea\" (Association for the Settlement of New Guinea) was founded. In 1930, it was followed by the \"Stichting Immigratie Kolonisatie Nieuw-Guinea\" (Foundation Immigration and Settlement New Guinea). These organisations regarded New Guinea as an untouched, almost empty land that could serve as a homeland to the sidelined Eurasians, a kind of tropical Holland, where Eurasians could create an existence.\nThese associations succeeded in sending settlers to New Guinea and lobbied successfully for the establishment of a government agency to subsidise these initiatives (in 1938). However, most settlements ended in failure because of the harsh climate and natural conditions, and because of the fact the settlers, previously office workers, were not skilled in agriculture. The number of settlers remained small. In the Netherlands proper, some organisations existed that promoted a kind of \"tropical Holland\" in New Guinea, but they were rather marginal. They were linked to the NSB party and other fascist organisations.\nOrigin of the dispute over New Guinea.\nIn 1942, most parts of the Netherlands Indies were occupied by Japan. Behind Japanese lines in New Guinea, Dutch guerrilla fighters resisted under Mauritz Christiaan Kokkelink. During the occupation the Indonesian nationalist movement went through a rapid development. After Japan's surrender, Sukarno issued the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, which was to encompass the whole of the Netherlands Indies. The Dutch authorities returned after several months under the leadership of Lieutenant-Governor-General Hubertus van Mook. Van Mook decided to reform Indonesia on a federal basis. This was not a completely new idea, but it was contrary to the administrative practice in the Netherlands Indies until then and contrary to the ideas of the nationalists, who wanted a centralist Indonesia.\nLinggadjati agreement.\nThe ethnic diversity of Indonesia was initially discussed at two conferences in Malino and Pangkalpinang. During the Pangkalpinang conference, the right of self-determination of the Eurasian, Chinese, and Arab ethnic minorities was discussed. The new \"Grooter Nederland-Actie\" (Extended Netherlands Action) send delegates to this conference, who opined that New Guinea should be declared as separate entities in a similar manner to Surinam. Furthermore, this conference stipulated specific territories could have special relations with the Kingdom of the Netherlands if they wanted to.\nVan Mook's plan was to divide Indonesia into several federal states, \"negaras\", with possible autonomous areas, \"daerahs\". The whole would be called the United States of Indonesia and would remain linked to the Netherlands in the Netherlands-Indonesian Union. The Indonesian side agreed to this plan during the Linggadjati conference in November 1946. Van Mook thought a federal structure would safeguard Indonesia's cultural and ethnic diversity. Van Mook and his supporters referred to the right of self-determination in this respect: the different ethnic communities of Indonesia should have the right to govern themselves.\nThe unilateral amendment of 'Linggadjati'.\nTo many Dutchmen, the idea of parting with Indonesia was shocking. Many Dutch thought their country had a mission to develop Indonesia. The Indonesian wish for independence to many Dutch came as a complete surprise. Because Indonesian nationalists, which had no electoral or official legitimacy\u2014save ethno-state nationalism, under Sukarno cooperated with the Japanese, they were branded as traitors and collaborators. Almost every Dutch political party was against Indonesian independence. The Protestant Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) were very supportive of the Dutch Ethical Policy in Indonesia. The newly established liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy campaigned for a hard-line policy against the nationalists. Even the Labour Party, which supported Indonesian independence in principle, was hesitant, because of the policies of Sukarno.\nMinister of Colonies Jan Anne Jonkman defended the Linggadjati Agreement in Parliament in 1946 by stating that the government wished for New Guinea to remain under Dutch sovereignty, arguing it could be a settlement for Eurasians. A motion entered by the Catholic People's Party (KVP) and the Labour Party, which was accepted by parliament, stated that the declaration of Jonkman in parliament should become a part of the Linggadjati agreement. Duly accepted, the Netherlands thus unilaterally 'amended' the Linggadjati agreement to the effect that New Guinea would remain Dutch. Labour parliamentary group leader Marinus van der Goes van Naters said afterwards the Labour Party entered the motion with the KVP because it feared the Catholics otherwise might reject the Linggadjati agreements.\nThe Indonesians did not accept this unilateral amendment. In order not to jeopardise the scheduled transfer of sovereignty, the Indonesian vice-president Mohammad Hatta offered to maintain Dutch sovereignty over New Guinea for one year and reopen the negotiations afterwards.\n1949\u20131956.\nThus in 1949, when the rest of the Dutch East Indies became fully independent as Indonesia, the Dutch retained sovereignty over western New Guinea, and took steps to prepare it for independence as a separate country. Some five thousand teachers were flown there. The Dutch put an emphasis upon political, business, and civic skills. On 8 February 1950, Stephan Lucien Joseph van Waardenburg was appointed the first Governor (\"De Gouverneur\") of Dutch New Guinea. The first local naval cadets graduated in 1955 and the first army brigade become operational in 1956.\n1957\u20131961.\nTensions regarding the Dutch-Indonesian dispute over Dutch New Guinea escalated in December 1957 following Indonesia's defeat in the UN General Assembly on 29 November 1957 to pass a resolution in favour of Indonesia's claim to the territory. Sukarno responded by allowing the seizure of Dutch enterprises operating in Indonesia and announcing the intended expulsion of Dutch residents from Indonesia. The increased tensions surrounding the dispute encouraged the Dutch to accelerate their plans to move the disputed territory towards an act of self-determination. Elections were held in January 1961 and the New Guinea Council officially took office on 5 April 1961, to prepare for full independence by the end of that decade. The Dutch endorsed the council's selection of a new national anthem and the Morning Star as the new national flag on 1 December 1961.\nFollowing the raising of the Papuan National Flag on 1 December 1961, tensions further escalated. On 19 December 1961 Sukarno issued the \"Tri Komando Rakjat\" (People's Triple Command), calling the Indonesian people to defeat the formation of an independent state of West Papua, raise the Indonesian flag in that country, and be ready for mobilisation at any time.\nSince 1962.\nEscalation to low-level conflict.\nIn 1962 Indonesia launched a significant campaign of airborne and seaborne infiltrations against the disputed territory, beginning with a seaborne infiltration launched by Indonesian forces on 15 January 1962. The Indonesian attack was comprehensively defeated by Dutch forces including the Dutch destroyers \"Evertsen\" and \"Kortenaer\", the so-called . Amongst the casualties was the Indonesian Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff; Commodore Yos Sudarso. Unbeknown to the Indonesians, Dutch Signals Intelligence had been able to intercept Indonesian communications, allowing Dutch forces to successfully anticipate Indonesia's infiltration attempts throughout 1962. Forced to regroup, the Indonesians relaunched their campaign of infiltrations in March 1962. In the coming months over 500 Indonesian paratroops and special forces were covertly inserted into Dutch New Guinea, only to be decisively defeated by Dutch forces with the assistance of the indigenous population.\nEllsworth Bunker proposal.\nFacing mounting international diplomatic pressure and the prospect of an Indonesian invasion force, the Dutch conceded to re-entering negotiations and agreed to the Ellsworth Bunker proposal on 28 July 1962, for a staged transition from Dutch to Indonesian control via UN administration, on the condition that a plebiscite would be held in future in the territory. The agreement was signed on 15 August 1962 at the UN Headquarters in New York and the territory was placed under the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority in October 1962. It was subsequently transferred to Indonesia in May 1963.\nThe territory formally became part of Indonesia in 1969 after the Indonesian government, who shifted to New Order under President Suharto starting from 1966, conducted a nominally Bunker proposal-based plebiscite termed the Act of Free Choice. The result, which under strong pressure from the military, unanimously wanted to become part of Indonesia. The UN General Assembly later acknowledged the result via the .\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was developed by Acorn Computers Ltd when they were selected by the BBC to supply the computer for their BBC Computer Literacy Project in 1981.\nIt was originally supplied on an installed ROM for the BBC Microcomputer which used a 6502 microprocessor. When Acorn produced the Archimedes computer which used their ARM processor, further versions of BBC BASIC were produced. Acorn included a built in assembler, first for the 6502 and later for the ARM2 processor.\nInitially the BBC specified compatibility with Microsoft BASIC. Acorn were already extending their earlier Atom BASIC to include structured programming constructs. Particularly on the later Archimedes computers as the memory constraints reduced, BBC BASIC incorporated a more complete set of structured programming constructs commonly found in the ALGOL 60 group of computer languages.\nAlongside Acorn's version of BBC BASIC on the Archimedes, third party companies produced compiled versions of the language. Development and support has continued after the demise of Acorn Computers Ltd for newer ARM based computers. BBC BASIC is now available on other platforms either for emulators such as on Microsoft Windows or natively.\nHistory.\nPrecursor languages.\nAt Dartmouth College, two mathematics professors wanted all students to be able to program on their new college computer. The existing high-level languages, like FORTRAN and COBOL, were used by professionals and not really suitable for introductory programming by non-technical users. In 1964, they created Dartmouth BASIC (short for \"Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\") to be a computer language anyone could use. Having a formula-based syntactic structure, it is a simplified FORTRAN.\nA combination of factors led to BASIC becoming a major language in the late 1960s, and in the 1970s when the first microcomputers were being built, it was already the \"de facto\" standard for small systems. The introduction of the Altair 8800 cemented the position of BASIC as the first programming language introduced for the platform was Paul Allen and Bill Gates' Altair BASIC. As new micros were introduced, almost all of them ran some variation of BASIC as its primary interface.\nBBC's involvement.\nDuring the 1970s, the BBC Continuing Education Department was considering how advancements in computer related technology would impact British society. Their Microelectronics Report in 1979 to the Manpower Services Commission describes formally their concerns about increasing polarisation and alienation in the workplace.\nThe BBC required a microcomputer usable for demonstrations in their programming that could be purchased by the general public to enable the viewer to themselves experiment. They decided that such a microcomputer needed to be robust, have expansion capabilities and an implementation of BASIC compatible with Microsoft BASIC VN5.\nJointly the government and the BBC established a public awareness and education campaign. This Computer Literacy Project (1980-1989) used the BBC's choice of the BBC Microcomputer produced by Acorn Computers Ltd. BBC BASIC was central to the user programming experience.\nAcorn's involvement.\nAcorn first developed System BASIC and Atom BASIC for their early 6502 microprocessor computers that were sold to kit-build customers. With the development of the Proton as a front-end processor, Acorn were designing for more powerful computing.\nIn order to produce a computer to satisfy the BBC specification, the Proton became the BBC Microcomputer, usable as a stand alone computer. By retaining the capability to be connected to a Z80 computer, Acorn was able to comply with the requirement of a computer supporting CP/M.\nSophie Wilson developed the implementations of BASIC at Acorn. The dialect on the BBC Microcomputer became compatible with Microsoft BASIC and so was acceptable to the BBC. It already had features from the ALGOL 60 group of computer languages that Wilson added to enable some structured programming methodology to be used.\nPlatforms and versions.\nBBC Micro.\nThe full version list is available here:\nBASIC I, the original version, was shipped on early BBC Micros.\nBASIC II was used on the Acorn Electron and BBC Micros shipped after 1982, including the Model B. It added the codice_1 and codice_2 keywords, along with offset assembly and bug fixes.\nBASIC III was produced in both a UK version and a United States market version for Acorn's abortive attempt to enter the cross-Atlantic computer market. Apart from a few bug fixes, the only change from BASIC II was that the codice_3 command could also be spelled codice_4: regardless of which was input, the UK version always listed it as codice_3, the US version as codice_4. The main place that BASIC III can be found is as the HI-BASIC version for the external second processor.\nBASIC IV, also known as CMOS BASIC, available on the BBC Master machines, was changed to use the new instructions available in the 65SC12 processor, reducing the size of the code and therefore allowing the inclusion of codice_7, codice_8 as a statement, codice_9, codice_10, codice_11, | in codice_12 statements and faster floating point. Bug fixes were again included.\nBASIC IV (1986) was a further improvement to BASIC IV, and was included on the Master Compact machine. The version of BASIC on the Compact included re-coded mathematical routines, said to provide a 30% speed increase over the version included in the rest of the Master series.\nHI-BASIC was available in two versions, the first based on BASIC III, and the second based on BASIC IV. Both were built to run from a higher address (&amp;B800) on the second processor, rather than the usual &amp;8000 address on the BBC\u00a0B. This allowed more program space to be available on either the external or internal 6502 second processors. A version was introduced to support a Zilog Z80 second processor.\nAnother version of BBC BASIC, called BAS128, was supplied on tape and disc with the BBC Master and Master Compact; it loaded into main RAM and used the 64\u00a0KB of Sideways RAM for user programs. This provided support for much larger programs at the cost of being a lot slower than the normal ROM-based version.\nThe interpreter can deal with both BASIC and 6502 assembly language, which can be included between the [ and ] characters. This contributed to the system's popularity with industrial and research engineers.\nFurther details/determining BASIC version.\nAs the BBC\u00a0MOS and RISC\u00a0OS were usually supplied on ROM, it may be assumed that a specific release of the operating system contained a specific version of BASIC. As such, there is no simple way to determine \"which\" version of BASIC is actually running other than by enquiring the operating system identity and thus making an assumption.\nNote that all Electrons, and later BBC microcomputers, have BASIC2: the earlier BBC microcomputers have BASIC1. If you are not sure which version of BASIC is in your machine, typing REPORT after BASIC has started up (after a BREAK or *BASIC), will print the copyright message. If the date is 1981, BASIC1 is fitted; if it is 1982, you have BASIC2. American machines, or those with a second processor, may have US BASIC or HIBASIC: the ROM routines will not be in the same place for these ROMS. \u2014\u200aBASIC ROM USER GUIDE\nSee also https:// entry for INKEY.\nOn the BBC family, it is possible to run both the standard BASIC \"and\" an enhanced HIBASIC on the 6502 second processor. One may determine if the program is running on the second processor by examining the initial value of PAGE, it will be &amp;800 if using the second processor. To distinguish between BASIC and HIBASIC, one should examine the initial value of HIMEM. This will be &amp;8000 for BASIC running on the second processor, and &amp;B800 for HIBASIC on the second processor.\nA similar situation exists on RISC OS where there may be the normal BASIC or BASIC64 (which offers higher precision maths). Normal BASIC identifies itself as \"BASIC V\" and BASIC64 identifies itself as \"BASIC VI\", therefore the following (used before any error has occurred) will distinguish one from the other:\nIF INSTR(REPORT$,\"VI\") THEN PRINT \"BASIC64\" ELSE PRINT \"BASIC\"\nThere are better ways of doing this. See the https://. In almost all cases you shouldn't need to be testing for what BASIC or platform your program is running on, just make the call and read whatever returned data are returned and deal with it.\nAcorn Archimedes (RISC OS).\nWith the move to the 32-bit ARM CPU and the removal of the 16\u00a0KB limit on the BASIC code size many new features were added. BASIC V version 1.04 was 61\u00a0KB long. Current versions of RISC OS still contain a BBC BASIC V interpreter. The source code to the RISC OS 5 version of BBC BASIC V has been released under the Apache 2.0 license by RISC OS Open.\nAmongst the new commands and features supported were:\nThe graphics commands were entirely backwards compatible, the sound less so; for example, the codice_24 keyword from BASIC V onwards is a command that takes fourteen numeric parameters and effectively does nothing\u2014 as in older versions, it calls OS_Word 8, but that does nothing on RISC OS. The in-line 6502 assembler was replaced by an ARM assembler. BASIC V was said, by Acorn, to be \"certainly the fastest interpreted BASIC in the world\" and \"probably the most powerful BASIC found on any computer\".\nBASIC VI is a version of BASIC V that supports IEEE 754 8-byte format real numbers, as opposed to the standard 5-byte format introduced in BASIC I.\nBBC BASIC V and VI were delivered as standard on the Acorn Archimedes and the RiscPC. A version of BBC BASIC V was also available to run on the ARM second processor for the BBC Micro.\nA compiler for BBC BASIC V was produced by Paul Fellows, team leader of the Arthur OS development, called the Archimedes BASIC Compiler and published initially by DABS Press. ABC was able to implement almost all of the language, with the obvious exception of the EVAL function, which inevitably required run-time programmatic interpretation. As evidence of its completeness, it was able to support inline assembler syntax. The compiler was written in BBC BASIC V. Many applications initially written to run under the interpreter benefitted from the performance boost that this gave, putting BBC BASIC V on a par with other languages for serious application development.\nOther platforms.\nBBC BASIC has also been ported to many other platforms.\nA NS32016 version of BBC BASIC was supplied with the Acorn 32016 coprocessor and Acorn ABC.\nIn addition to the version of BBC BASIC supplied with the BBC Micro's Zilog Z80 second processor, a Z80-based version of BBC BASIC also exists for CP/M-based systems. A Zilog Z80 version of BBC BASIC was also used on the Tiki 100 desktop computer, Cambridge Z88 portable and the Amstrad NC100 Notepad and Amstrad NC200 Notebook computers. This version has been implemented on the TI-83 Plus and TI-84 Plus series graphing calculators. Due to efforts of J.\u00a0G. Harston (also responsible for a PDP-11 version updated as of 2025; implementing BBC BASICV IV and a few additions from BBC BASIC V extensions) a version of https:// for the ZX Spectrum was released in January 2002, with many improvements made in subsequent releases.\nBBC BASIC was also implemented for MS-DOS as \"BBCBASIC (86)\", which aimed for maximum compatibility with the BBC Micro, and \"BBasic\" with its own enhancements based on BASIC II.\nA version of BBC BASIC integrated with the Windows graphical user interface, http:// created by Richard Russell, developer of the Z80 and x86 versions, was released in 2001. Whilst supporting nearly completely the original BBC BASIC specification (BASIC IV), the Windows version supports much of BASIC V/VI syntax as well as some advanced features of its own. Features unique to BBC BASIC for Windows include interpreter support for record/structure types, and the ability to call Windows API routines or those in an external DLL. Recent versions have included advanced features comparable with languages like C, and an external library has recently added support for objects.\nBBC BASIC for SDL was also developed by Richard T. Russell, and is largely compatible with the previous BBC BASIC for Windows, sharing with that dialect many new and advanced features including data structures, PRIVATE variables, an EXIT statement, long strings, event interrupts, an address-of operator, byte variables, a line continuation character, indirect procedure and function calls and improved numeric accuracy. The first version was released in February 2019, and remains in active development as of \u00a02025[ [update]]. https:// supports Windows, MacOS, Linux, Raspberry Pi OS, Android, iOS and mobile devices supporting the SDL library, as well as a version which allows the running of BBC BASIC programs as applets in a web-page via the Web Assembly framework. Programs can be run via the interpreter or compiled to a standalone application bundle which will run without BBC BASIC having to be installed (.exe file in Windows, .dmg file in MacOS, .zip file in Linux or Raspberry Pi OS and .apk file in Android). A high degree of compatibility with the BBC Microcomputer is also retained, including emulation of the SOUND and ENVELOPE statements, and the MODE 7 (teletext) screen mode. BBC BASIC for SDL 2.0 incorporates an assembler which depends on the CPU in the platform: x86 (32-bit or 64-bit) for Windows, MacOS or Linux; ARM (32-bit or 64-bit) for Raspberry Pi. In the case of Android the assembler is ARM or x86 as appropriate. Application Program Interface (API) functions can be accessed from BASIC and from assembler code, allowing an experienced programmer to produce sophisticated applications.\nA GPL clone of BBC BASIC named \"Brandy\", written in portable C, is also available. A fork of this, \"Matrix Brandy\", remains under active development.\nAn emulator of the BBC Micro for the Amiga was produced by Ariadne Software for CBM (UK). While extremely fast, it did not emulate the 6502 at full speed, so assembly code would run slower than a real BBC while BASIC programs would run much faster. Due to the way the optimised BASIC and the 6502 emulation interacted, almost no commercial games would run but well-behaved code and educational software generally worked. Additionally, it used a slightly less precise floating-point numeric format. For a while it was bundled with a special academic package of the Amiga 500, in the hope that schools would replace their ageing BBC Bs with Amiga 500s.\nA version of BBC BASIC V (Z80) has also been made for the TI-83/84+ Texas Instruments calculator families by Benjamin Ryves.\nA Commodore 64 version \"Shado\" was produced by a small software house Aztec Software in the early 1980s. Patched versions of Acorn's 6502 based HI-BASIC have also been experimentally run on C64, with an interface to the C64 Kernel, replacing the Acorn MOS calls otherwise made.\nThere have also been efforts to make 6502 based version of BBC BASIC available on the Apple II. https:// being one such effort.\nBBC BASIC is the programming language used in the Agon Light, an open-sourced 8-bit Z80-based single-board computer and microcontroller designed by Bernardo Kastrup and released in 2022.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is part of the district of Ernakulam in the state of Kerala. The city is also commonly referred to as Ernakulam. As of 2011, the Kochi Municipal Corporation had a population of 677,381 over an area of 94.88\u00a0km2, and the larger Kochi urban agglomeration had over 2.1\u00a0million inhabitants within an area of 440\u00a0km2, making it the largest and the most populous metropolitan area in Kerala. Kochi city is also part of the Greater Cochin development region and is classified as a Tier-II city by the Government of India. The civic body that governs the city is the Kochi Municipal Corporation, which was constituted in the year 1967, and the statutory bodies that oversee its development are the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) and the Goshree Islands Development Authority (GIDA).\nNicknamed the Queen of the Arabian Sea, Kochi was an important spice trading center on the west coast of India from antiquity. The port of Muziris traded with the Romans, Persians, Arabs, and Chinese. From 1503 to 1663, the Portuguese established Fort Kochi (Fort Emmanuel), before it was taken over by the Dutch in 1663. The Dutch then ceded the area to the United Kingdom. Kochi remained under the control of the Kingdom of Cochin, which became a princely state of the British. Today, Kochi is known as the financial, commercial and industrial capital of Kerala. Kochi is the only city in the country to have a water metro system, which has been described as the world's largest electric boat metro transportation infrastructure. Kochi also successfully conducted the test flight for Kerala's first seaplane service. The Cochin International Airport is the first in the world to operate solely on solar energy. Kochi was one of the 28 Indian cities among the emerging 440 global cities that will contribute 50% of the world GDP by 2025, in a 2011 study done by the McKinsey Global Institute. In July 2018, Kochi was ranked the topmost emerging future megacity in India by global professional services firm JLL.\nKochi's rich cultural heritage has made it a popular tourist destination among both domestic and international travellers. It has been hosting India's first art biennale, the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, since 2012, which attracts international artists and tourists. The Chinese fishing nets, introduced during the 14th century by the Chinese, are a symbol of the city and a popular tourist attraction in themselves. Other landmarks include Mattanchery Palace, Marine Drive, Venduruthy Bridge, Church of Saint Francis and Mattanchery Bridge. The city ranks first in the total number of international and domestic tourist arrivals in Kerala. The city was ranked the sixth best tourist destination in India according to a survey conducted by the Nielsen Company on behalf of the Outlook Traveller magazine. In October 2019, Kochi was ranked seventh in Lonely Planet's list of top 10 cities in the world to visit in 2020. In November 2023, the British Luxury travel magazine Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller rated Kochi as one of the best places to go in Asia in 2024.\nEtymology.\nAncient travellers and tradesmen referred to Kochi, variously alluding to it as \"Cocym\", \"Cochym\", \"Cochin\", and \"Kochi\". The Cochin Jewish community called Cochin \"Kogin\" (), which is seen in the seal of the synagogue owned by the community. The Arab merchants called this place \"Kashi\", which is seen in the books such as \"Tuhfat Ul Mujahideen\". The origin of the name \"Kochi\" is thought to be the Malayalam word \"kochu azhi\", meaning 'small lagoon'. Accounts by the Italian explorers Nicolo Conti (in the 15th century) and Fra Paoline (in the 17th century) say that it was called \"Kochchi\", named after the river connecting the backwaters to the sea. After the arrival of the Portuguese, and later the British, the name \"Cochin\" stuck as the official appellation. The city reverted to a closer transcription of its original Malayalam name, \"Kochi\", in 1996. This change in name was challenged by the city municipal corporation, but the court later dismissed the plea.\nHistory.\nMuziris, a port somewhere north of Kochi (mostly identified with Kodungallur in Thrissur district), was the centre of Indian spice trade for many centuries, and was known to the Arabs, Yavanas (Greeks and Romans) as well as Jews, Syrians, and Chinese since ancient times. Kochi rose to significance as a trading centre after the port Muziris around Kodungallur (Cranganore) was destroyed by the massive flooding of Periyar in 1341. The earliest documented references to Kochi occur in books written by Chinese voyager Ma Huan during his visit to Kochi in the 15th century as part of Admiral Zheng He's treasure fleet. There are also references to Kochi in accounts written by Italian traveller Niccol\u00f2 Da Conti, who visited Kochi in 1440. The ruler of Perumpadappu (near Ponnani) fled to Kodungallur in the early medieval period, when the Zamorin of Calicut annexed Ponnani region, after Tirunavaya war. They later moved to Kochi and established the Kingdom of Cochin. When Vasco Da Gama landed at Kozhikode and the Zamorin of Calicut fought against the Portuguese with Kunjali Marakkar, the ruler of Cochin aligned with the Portuguese.\nOn the Malabar coast during the early 15th century, Calicut and Kochi were in an intense rivalry, so the Ming dynasty of China decided to intervene by granting special status to Kochi and its ruler known as \"Keyili\" (\u53ef\u4ea6\u91cc) to the Chinese. Calicut had been the dominant port-city in the region, but Kochi was emerging as its main rival. For the fifth Ming treasure voyage, Admiral Zheng He was instructed to confer a seal upon \"Keyili\" of Kochi and enfeoff a mountain in his kingdom as the \"Zhenguo Zhi Shan\" (\u93ae\u570b\u4e4b\u5c71, Mountain Which Protects the Country). Zheng He delivered a stone tablet, inscribed with a proclamation composed by the Yongle Emperor himself, to Kochi. As long as Kochi remained under the protection of Ming China, the Zamorin of Calicut was unable to invade Kochi and a military conflict was averted. The cessation of the Ming treasure voyages consequently had negative results for Kochi, as the Zamorin of Calicut would eventually launch an invasion against Kochi. In the late 15th century, the Zamorin occupied Kochi and installed his representative as the king of the port-city.\nAccording to many historians, the precursor state to Kingdom of Kochi came into existence in the early 12th century, after the fall of the Chera Kingdom. The reign of the Kingdom was hereditary, and the family that ruled over the region was known as the \"Perumpadappu Swaroopam\" in the local vernacular.\nThe port at Kozhikode held superior economic and political position in medieval Kerala coast, while Kannur, Kollam, and Kochi, were commercially important secondary ports, where the traders from various parts of the world would gather. The Portuguese arrived at Kappad Kozhikode in 1498 during the Age of Discovery, thus opening a direct sea route from Europe to India. Portuguese navigator, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral founded the first European settlement in India at Kochi in 1500. From 1503 to 1663, Fort Kochi (Fort Emmanuel) was ruled by Portugal. This Portuguese period was a harrowing time for the Saint Thomas Christians, Muslim Mappilas, and the Jews, as the Inquisition was active in Portuguese India. The ruler of the Kingdom of Tanur, who was a vassal to the Zamorin of Calicut, sided with the Portuguese, against his overlord at Kozhikode. As a result, the Kingdom of Tanur (\"Vettathunadu\") became one of the earliest Portuguese Colonies in India. The ruler of Tanur also sided with Cochin. Many of the members of the royal family of Cochin in 16th and 17th centuries were selected from Vettom. However, the Tanur forces under the king fought for the Zamorin of Calicut in the Battle of Cochin (1504). However, the allegiance of the Mappila merchants in Tanur region still stayed under the Zamorin of Calicut. Kochi hosted the grave of Vasco da Gama, the first European explorer to set sail for India, who was buried at St. Francis Church until his remains were returned to Portugal in 1539. The Portuguese rule was followed by that of the Dutch who renamed Fort Immanuel as Fort Stormsburg. In meantime, the Royal Family of Kochi relocated the capital of Kochi Kingdom to Thrissur, leaving nominal authority over Islands of Kochi. In 1664, Fort Kochi Municipality was established by Dutch, making it the first municipality in Indian subcontinent, which got dissolved when Dutch authority got weaker in the 18th century. The remaining part of Kochi were governed by governors of Kochi Kingdom. By 1773, the Mysore ruler Hyder Ali extended his conquest in the Malabar region to Kochi forcing it to become a tributary of Mysore. The hereditary Prime Ministership of Kochi held by the Paliath Achans ended during this period.\nMeanwhile, the Dutch, fearing an outbreak of war on the United Provinces, signed the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 with the United Kingdom, under which Kochi was ceded to the United Kingdom in exchange for the island of Bangka, east of Sumatra. However, there are evidences of English habitation in the region even before the signing of the treaty. In 1866, Fort Kochi municipality was reinstalled. Fort Kochi, which was a part of Malabar District until 1956, was made a municipality on 1 November 1866, along with Kannur, Thalassery, Kozhikode, and Palakkad, according to the Madras Act 10 of 1865 (Amendment of the Improvements in Towns act 1850) of the British Indian Empire. Its first Municipal Council seating contest was conducted in 1883. In 1896, H.H. Rama Varma XV, The Maharaja of Cochin, initiated local administration by forming town councils in Mattancherry and Ernakulam. In 1907, the Governor of the Madras Presidency, Sir Arthur Lawley and his brother, Beilby Lawley, 3rd Baron Wenlock, Governor of Madras, 1891 to 1896, left for an official tour of Cochin and Travancore, which lasted from 25 January to 14 February. On 26 January, they were met by His Highness the Rajah of Cochin who gave a State Dinner in their honour at Ernakulam. By the 1870s, the capital of Kochi Kingdom was relocated again to Kochi Suburb of Tripunithura. In 1910, Ernakulam became the administrative capital of Kochi Kingdom with establishment of Royal Secretariat and State Durbar. The offices of the Diwan and High court were soon moved into Ernakulam.\nIn 1925, Kochi legislative assembly was constituted due to public pressure on the state. Towards the early 20th century, trade at the port had increased substantially, and the need to develop the port was greatly felt. Harbour engineer Robert Bristow was brought to Kochi in 1920 under the direction of Lord Willingdon, then the Governor of Madras. In a span of 21 years, he transformed Kochi as one of the safest harbours in the peninsula, where ships berthed alongside the newly reclaimed inner harbour equipped with a long array of steam cranes.\nIn 1947, when India gained independence from the British colonial rule, Cochin was the first princely state to join India willingly.\nIn 1949, Travancore\u2013Cochin state came into being with the merger of Cochin and Travancore. The King of Travancore was the Rajpramukh of the Travancore\u2013Cochin Union from 1949 to 1956. Travancore-Cochin, was in turn merged with the Malabar district of the Madras State. Finally, the Government of India's States Reorganisation Act (1956) inaugurated a new state\u2014Kerala\u2014incorporating Travancore-Cochin (excluding the four southern Taluks which were merged with Tamil Nadu), Malabar District, and the taluk of Kasargod, South Kanara. On 9 July 1960 the Mattancherry council passed a resolution\u2014which was forwarded to the government\u2014requesting the formation of a municipal corporation by combining the existing municipalities of Fort Kochi, Mattancherry, and Ernakulam. The government appointed a commission to study the feasibility of the suggested merger. Based on its report, the Kerala Legislative Assembly approved the corporation's formation. On 1 November 1967, exactly eleven years since the establishment of the state of Kerala, the Kochi Municipal Corporation came into existence. The merger leading to the establishment of the corporation, was between the municipalities of Ernakulam, Mattancherry and Fort Kochi, along with that of the Willingdon Island, four panchayats (Palluruthy, Vennala, Vyttila and Edappally), and the small islands of Gundu and Ramanthuruth.\nThe Kochi and Ernakulam districts formed on 1 April 1958 carving areas of the erstwhile Travancore-Kochi-Malabar regions. A major portion of the district is from the Kochi kingdom.\nThe city's economic growth gathered momentum after economic reforms in India introduced by the central government in the early 1990s. Since 2000, the service sector has energised the city's economy. The establishment of several industrial parks based on IT and other port based infrastructure triggered a construction and realty boom in the city. Over the years, Kochi has witnessed rapid commercialisation, and has today grown into the commercial hub of Kerala.\nGeography and climate.\nGeography.\nKochi is located on the southwest coast of India at , with a corporation limit area of . Over the years, the city has expanded considerably outside the corporation limit set in 1967, although the official city limits haven't been changed. The city straddles the backwaters, encompassing the northern end of a peninsula, several islands and a portion of the mainland. To the west lies the Laccadive Sea, and to the east is the urbanised region in the rest of the mainland area. Much of Kochi lies at sea level, with a coastline of 48\u00a0km.\nThe eastern part of Kochi is mainly known as Ernakulam, while the western part of it after the Venduruthy Bridge is called as Western Kochi. The current metropolitan limits of Kochi include the mainland Ernakulam, Fort Kochi, the suburbs of Edapally, Kalamassery, Aluva, Perumbavoor, Angamaly and Kakkanad to the northeast; Tripunithura to the southeast; and a group of islands closely scattered in the Vembanad Lake. The state government and the GCDA have plans to include Mala and Kodungallur in Thrissur district. Piravom and Kolenchery in Ernakulam district, Thalayolaparambu and Vaikom in Kottayam and Cherthala in Alappuzha district within Kochi metropolitan limits. The newly formed metropolis would be put under the charge of a new authority called Kochi Metropolitan Regional Development Authority. However, \"The Hindu\" reported that the state government is yet to take any concrete steps in this regard.\nSoil consists of sediments such as alluvium, teris, brown sands, etc. Hydromorphic saline soils are also found in the areas surrounding the backwaters.\nPredominant rock types found here are Archaean-basic dykes, Charnockites and Gneisses. An ecologically sensitive area, the Mangalavanam Bird Sanctuary is located in the central part of the city. It has a wide range of mangrove species and is a nesting ground for a vast variety of migratory birds.\nKochi's water needs are entirely dependent on ground water and the Periyar and Muvattupuzha rivers flowing through the district. The Periyar serves the entire northern part of the city and the Muvattupuzha river under the JnNurm project covers the western part.\nClimate.\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Kochi features a tropical monsoon climate (\"Am\"). Kochi's proximity to the equator along with its coastal location results in little seasonal temperature variation, with moderate to high levels of humidity. Annual temperatures range between with the record high being , and record low .\nFrom June to September, the south-west monsoon brings in heavy rains as Kochi lies on the windward side of the Western Ghats. From October to December, Kochi receives lighter (yet significant) rain from the northeast monsoon, as it lies on the leeward side. Average annual rainfall is , with an annual average of 124 rainy days.\nCivic administration.\nThe city is governed by the Kochi Corporation, headed by a mayor. For administrative purposes, the city is divided into 74 wards, from which the members of the corporation council are elected for five years. Earlier; Fort Kochi, Mattancherry and Ernakulam were the three Municipalities in Cochin area, which was later merged to form the Cochin Corporation. The corporation has its headquarters in Ernakulam, and zonal offices at Fort Kochi, Mattancherry, Palluruthy, Edappally and Pachalam. The general administration of the city is handled by the Personnel Department and the Council Standing committee Section. Other departments include that of town planning, health, engineering, revenue and accounts. The corporation is also responsible for waste disposal and sewage management. The city produces more than 600 tons of waste per day and a large portion of waste is decomposed at Brahmapuram Solid Waste plant into organic manure. The supply of potable water, sourced from the Periyar River is handled by Kerala Water Authority with support of Water works department of Kochi Corporation. Electricity is provided by the Kerala State Electricity Board.\nThe GCDA and GIDA are the government agencies initiating and monitoring the development of Greater Cochin area, mainly in developing infrastructure facilities for the city. \nThe Council of the Kochi Municipal Corporation is the city\u2019s legislative body comprising elected councillors from each ward. Chosen through elections every five years, it is headed by the Mayor, assisted by the Deputy Mayor, and is responsible for local governance, policy decisions, and civic administration. The Secretary is the chief administrative officer of the Kochi Municipal Corporation, handling administration and execution of council decisions.\nLaw and order.\nKochi is the seat of the High Court of Kerala, the highest judicial body in the state. It is often referred to as the judicial capital of Kerala.\nThe Kochi City Police, a division of Kerala Police, is responsible for law enforcement and investigation within the city limits. Headed by a Police Commissioner, an officer of the Indian Police Service (IPS), the city police is organized into five subdivisions and operates 28 police stations. In addition to the regular law and order wing, the force includes the Traffic Police, Highway Police, Special Branch, Crime Branch, Narcotics Cell, Riot Control Unit, Armed Reserve Camps, District Crime Records Bureau, and a Women's Police Station.\nAn anti-corruption branch of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) also operates out of the city. CISF maintains 3 squadrons for providing security to various central and state heavy industries, airport and seaport zones. Other major central agencies are NIA, DRI and Indian Customs due to the presence of major port. According to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Kochi reported significant increase of 193.7 per cent IPC crimes in 2010 compared to 2009, and reported a crime rate of 1,897.8 compared to the 424.1 in whole Kerala. However, the city police commissioner defended that in major crimes such as murders and kidnapping, the city registered a low crime rate even behind other cities in the state.\nPolitics.\nKochi is part of the Ernakulam Lok Sabha constituency in Indian Parliament. The current elected Member of Parliament (\"Lok Sabha\") representing the constituency is Hibi Eden of Indian National Congress.

Being a major online trading centre in the country, Kochi has a newly opened SEBI office.\nAvailability of electricity, fresh water, long coastline, backwaters, good banking facilities, presence of a major port, container trans-shipment terminal, harbour terminal and an international air terminal are some of the factors which accelerated the industrial growth in the city and its adjoining district. In recent years the city has witnessed heavy investment, thus making it one of the fastest-growing second-tier metro cities in India. Sales tax income generated in the Kochi metropolitan area contributes heavily to state revenue.\nThe district contributes 15.1% of the state GDP.

It is classified between order and genus. A family may be divided into subfamilies, which are intermediate ranks between the ranks of family and genus. The official family names are Latin in origin; however, popular names are often used: for example, walnut trees and hickory trees belong to the family Juglandaceae, but that family is commonly referred to as the \"walnut family\".\nThe delineation of what constitutes a family\u2014or whether a described family should be acknowledged\u2014is established and decided upon by active taxonomists. There are not strict regulations for outlining or acknowledging a family, yet in the realm of plants, these classifications often rely on both the vegetative and reproductive characteristics of plant species. Taxonomists frequently hold varying perspectives on these descriptions, leading to a lack of widespread consensus within the scientific community for extended periods.\nNomenclature.\nThe naming of families is codified by various international bodies using the following suffixes:\nName changes at the family level are regulated by the codes of nomenclature. For botanical families, some traditional names like Palmae (Arecaceae), Cruciferae (Brassicaceae), and Leguminosae (Fabaceae) are conserved alongside their standardized -aceae forms due to their historical significance and widespread use in the literature.\nFamily names are typically formed from the stem of a type genus within the family. In zoology, when a valid family name is based on a genus that is later found to be a junior synonym, the family name may be maintained for stability if it was established before 1960. In botany, some family names that were found to be junior synonyms have been conserved due to their widespread use in the scientific literature.\nThe family-group in zoological nomenclature includes several ranks: superfamily (-oidea), family (-idae), subfamily (-inae), and tribe (-ini). Under the principle of coordination, a name established at any of these ranks can be moved to another rank while retaining its original authorship and date, requiring only a change in suffix to reflect its new rank.\nNew family descriptions are relatively rare in taxonomy, occurring in fewer than one in a hundred taxonomic publications. Such descriptions typically result from either the discovery of organisms with unique combinations of characters that do not fit existing families, or from phylogenetic analyses that reveal the need for reclassification.\nHistory.\nThe taxonomic term ' was first used by French botanist Pierre Magnol in his ' (1689) where he called the seventy-six groups of plants he recognised in his tables families ('). The concept of rank at that time was not yet settled, and in the preface to the ' Magnol spoke of uniting his families into larger \"\", which is far from how the term is used today.\nIn his work \"Philosophia Botanica\" published in 1751, Carl Linnaeus employed the term \"familia\" to categorize significant plant groups such as trees, herbs, ferns, palms, and so on. Notably, he restricted the use of this term solely within the book's morphological section, where he delved into discussions regarding the vegetative and generative aspects of plants. Subsequently, in French botanical publications, from Michel Adanson's ' (1763) and until the end of the 19th century, the word ' was used as a French equivalent of the Latin ' (or ').\nThe family concept in botany was further developed by the French botanists Antoine Laurent de Jussieu and Michel Adanson. Jussieu's 1789 \"Genera Plantarum\" divided plants into 100 'natural orders,' many of which correspond to modern plant families. However, the term 'family' did not become standardized in botanical usage until after the mid-nineteenth century.\nIn zoology, the family as a rank intermediate between order and genus was introduced by Pierre Andr\u00e9 Latreille in his \"\" (1796). He used families (some of them were not named) in some but not in all his orders of \"insects\" (which then included all arthropods).\nThe standardization of zoological family names began in the early nineteenth century. A significant development came in 1813 when William Kirby introduced the -idae suffix for animal family names, derived from the Greek 'eidos' meaning 'resemblance' or 'like'. The adoption of this naming convention helped establish families as an important taxonomic rank. By the mid-1800s, many of Linnaeus's broad genera were being elevated to family status to accommodate the rapidly growing number of newly discovered species.\nIn nineteenth-century works such as the ' of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle and the ' of George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker this word \"\" was used for what now is given the rank of family.\nUses.\nFamilies serve as valuable units for evolutionary, paleontological, and genetic studies due to their relatively greater stability compared to lower taxonomic levels like genera and species.\nFamilies play a significant practical role in biological education and research. They provide an efficient framework for teaching taxonomy, as they group organisms with general similarities while remaining specific enough to be useful for identification purposes. For example, in botany, learning the characteristics of major plant families helps students identify related species across different geographic regions, since families often have worldwide distribution patterns. In many groups of organisms, families serve as the primary level for taxonomic identification keys, making them particularly valuable for field guides and systematic work as they often represent readily recognizable groups of related organisms with shared characteristics.\nIn ecological and biodiversity research, families frequently serve as the foundational level for identification in survey work and environmental studies. This is particularly useful because families often share life history traits or occupy similar ecological niches. Some families show strong correlations between their taxonomic grouping and ecological functions, though this relationship varies among different groups of organisms.\nThe stability of family names has practical importance for applied biological work, though this stability faces ongoing challenges from new scientific findings. Modern molecular studies and phylogenetic analyses continue to refine the understanding of family relationships, sometimes leading to reclassification. The impact of these changes varies among different groups of organisms \u2013 while some families remain well-defined and easily recognizable, others require revision as new evidence emerges about evolutionary relationships. This balance between maintaining nomenclatural stability and incorporating new scientific discoveries remains an active area of taxonomic practice.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The plant is a herbaceous perennial that grows from short, thick rhizomes. Historically, different plants have been called \"rhubarb\" in English. The large, triangular leaves contain high levels of oxalic acid and anthrone glycosides, making them poisonous and therefore inedible. The small flowers are grouped in large compound leafy greenish-white to rose-red inflorescences.\nThe precise origin of culinary rhubarb is unknown. The species \"Rheum rhabarbarum\" (syn. \"R.\u00a0undulatum\") and \"R.\u00a0rhaponticum\" were grown in Europe before the 18th century and used for medicinal purposes. By the early 18th century, these two species and a possible hybrid of unknown origin, \"R.\"\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\"hybridum\", were grown as vegetable crops in England and Scandinavia. They readily hybridize, and culinary rhubarb was developed by selecting open-pollinated seed, so its precise origin is almost impossible to determine. In appearance, samples of culinary rhubarb vary on a continuum between \"R.\u00a0rhaponticum\" and \"R.\u00a0rhabarbarum\". However, modern rhubarb cultivars are tetraploids with 2\"n\" = 44, in contrast to 2\"n\" = 22 for the wild species.\nRhubarb is a vegetable but is often put to the same culinary uses as fruits. The leaf stalks can be used raw while they have a crisp texture, but are most commonly cooked with sugar and used in pies, crumbles, and other desserts. They have a strong, tart taste. Many cultivars have been developed for human consumption, most of which are recognised as \"Rheum\" \u00d7 \"hybridum\" by the Royal Horticultural Society.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"rhubarb\" is likely to have derived in the 14th century from the Old French , which came from the Latin and Greek , meaning \"foreign rhubarb\". The Greek physician Dioscorides used the Greek word (), whereas Galen later used (), Latin . These in turn derive from a Persian name for species of \"Rheum\". The specific epithet \"rhaponticum\", applying to one of the presumed parents of the cultivated plant, means \"rha from the region of the Black Sea\" or the river Volga, \"rha\" being its ancient name.\nCultivation.\nRhubarb is grown widely, and with greenhouse production it is available throughout much of the year. It needs rainfall and an annual cold period of up to 7\u20139 weeks at 3\u00a0\u00b0C (37\u00a0\u00b0F), known as 'cold units', to grow well. The plant develops a substantial underground storage organ (rhubarb crowns) and this can be used for early production by transferring field-grown crowns to warm conditions. Rhubarb grown in hothouses (heated greenhouses) is called \"hothouse rhubarb\", and is typically made available at consumer markets in early spring, before outdoor cultivated rhubarb is available. Hothouse rhubarb is usually brighter red, tenderer and sweeter-tasting than outdoor rhubarb. After forcing for commercial production, the crowns are usually discarded. In temperate climates, rhubarb is one of the first food plants harvested, usually in mid- to late spring (April or May in the Northern Hemisphere, October or November in the Southern Hemisphere), and the season for field-grown plants lasts until the end of summer.\nIn the United Kingdom, the first rhubarb of the year is harvested by candlelight in forcing sheds where all other light is excluded, a practice that produces a sweeter, more tender stalk. These sheds are dotted around the \"Rhubarb Triangle\" in Yorkshire between Wakefield, Leeds, and Morley.\nIn the United States, rhubarb is primarily produced in the states of Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin with approximately 1,200 acres in production, of which 175 are covered in hothouses. In the northwestern US states of Oregon and Washington, there are typically two harvests, from late April to May and from late June into July; half of all US commercial production is in Pierce County, Washington. Rhubarb is ready to consume as soon as harvested, and freshly cut stalks are firm and glossy.\nRhubarb damaged by severe cold should not be eaten, as it may be high in oxalic acid, which migrates from the leaves and can cause illness.\nThe colour of rhubarb stalks can vary from the commonly associated crimson red, through speckled light pink, to simply light green. Rhubarb stalks are poetically described as \"crimson stalks\". The colour results from the presence of anthocyanins, and varies according to both rhubarb variety and production technique. The colour is not related to its suitability for cooking.\nHistorical cultivation.\nThe Chinese call rhubarb \"the great yellow\" ( ), and have used rhubarb root for medicinal purposes. It appears in \"The Divine Farmer's Herb-Root Classic\", which is thought to have been compiled about 1,800 years ago. Though Dioscurides' description of or indicates that a medicinal root brought to Greece from beyond the Bosphorus may have been rhubarb, commerce in the plant did not become securely established until Islamic times. During Islamic times, it was imported along the Silk Road, reaching Europe in the 14th century through the ports of Aleppo and Smyrna, where it became known as \"Turkish rhubarb\". Later, it began to arrive via new maritime routes and overland through Russia. The \"Russian rhubarb\" was the most valued, probably because of the rhubarb-specific quality control system maintained by the Russian Empire. The 2020 edition of Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China lists the following species as medicinally acceptable: \"Rheum officinale\", \"Rheum palmatum\", and \"Rheum tanguticum\". Grieve describes \"Turkish rhubarb\" as a mixture of \"R. palmatum\" and \"R. rhaponticum\".\nThe cost of transportation across Asia made rhubarb expensive in medieval Europe. It was several times the price of other valuable herbs and spices such as cinnamon, opium, and saffron. The merchant explorer Marco Polo therefore searched for the place where the plant was grown and harvested, discovering that it was cultivated in the mountains of Tangut province. The value of rhubarb can be seen in Ruy Gonz\u00e1les de Clavijo's report of his embassy in 1403\u20131405 to Timur in Samarkand: \"The best of all merchandise coming to Samarkand was from China: especially silks, satins, musk, rubies, diamonds, pearls, and rhubarb...\"\nThe high price, as well as the increasing demand from apothecaries, stimulated efforts to cultivate the different species of rhubarb on European soil. \"R. rhaponticum\" \u00d7 \"R. officinale\" came to be grown in England to produce the roots. \"R. alpinus\" was also allowed to grow wild. The local availability of the plants grown for medicinal purposes, together with the increasing abundance and decreasing price of sugar in the 18th century, galvanised its culinary adoption. Grieve claims a date of 1820 in England. Rhubarb was harvested in Scotland from at least 1786, having been introduced to the Botanical Garden in Edinburgh by the traveller Bruce of Kinnaird in 1774. He brought the seeds from Abyssinia and they produced 3,000 plants.\nThough it is often asserted that rhubarb first came to the United States in the 1820s, John Bartram was growing medicinal and culinary rhubarbs in Philadelphia from the 1730s, planting seeds sent to him by Peter Collinson. From the first, the familiar garden rhubarb was not the only \"Rheum\" in American gardens: Thomas Jefferson planted \"R. undulatum\" at Monticello in 1809 and 1811, observing that it was \"Esculent rhubarb, the leaves excellent as Spinach.\"\nCultivars.\nThe advocate of organic gardening Lawrence D. Hills listed his favourite rhubarb varieties for flavour as 'Hawke's Champagne', 'Victoria', 'Timperley Early', and 'Early Albert', also recommending 'Gaskin's Perpetual' for having the lowest level of oxalic acid, allowing it to be harvested over a much longer period of the growing season without developing excessive sourness.\nThe Royal Horticultural Society has the UK's national collection of rhubarb that comprises 103 varieties. In 2021\u20132022 this was moved from southern England to the more northern garden RHS Bridgewater where winter cold and rainfall are better suited for rhubarb. The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: \nUses.\nRhubarb is grown primarily for its fleshy leafstalks, technically known as petioles. The use of rhubarb stalks as food is a relatively recent innovation. This usage was first recorded in 18th- to 19th-century England after affordable sugar became more widely available.\nCommonly, it is stewed with sugar or used in pies and desserts, but it can also be put into savoury dishes or pickled. Rhubarb can be dehydrated and infused with fruit juice. In the United States, it is usually infused with strawberry juice to mimic the popular strawberry rhubarb pie.\nFood.\nThe species \"Rheum ribes\" has been eaten in the Islamic world since the 10th century.\nIn Northern Europe and North America, the stalks are commonly cut into pieces and stewed with added sugar until soft. The resulting compote, sometimes thickened with corn starch, can then be used in pies, tarts and crumbles. Alternatively, greater quantities of sugar can be added with pectin to make jams. A paired spice used is ginger, although cinnamon and nutmeg are also common additions.\nIn the United Kingdom, as well as being used in the typical pies, tarts and crumbles, rhubarb compote is also combined with whipped cream or custard to make rhubarb fool. In the United States, the common usage of rhubarb in pies has led to it being nicknamed \"pie plant\", by which it is referred to in 19th-century cookbooks. Rhubarb in the US is also often paired with strawberries to make strawberry-rhubarb pie, though some rhubarb purists jokingly consider this \"a rather unhappy marriage\".\nRhubarb can also be used to make alcoholic drinks, such as fruit wines or Finnish rhubarb \"sima\". It is also used to make Kompot.\nNutrition.\nRaw rhubarb is 94% water, 5% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a reference amount, raw rhubarb supplies of food energy, and is a rich source of vitamin K (24% of the Daily Value, DV) and a moderate source of potassium (10% DV), with no other micronutrients in significant amounts (table).\nTraditional Chinese medicine.\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, rhubarb roots of several species were used as a laxative for several millennia, although there is no clinical evidence to indicate such use is effective.\nPhytochemistry and potential toxicity.\nThe roots and stems contain anthraquinones, such as emodin and rhein. Emodin \"represents a genotoxic risk for humans\" while rhein is \"a compound devoid of genotoxic capabilities\". The anthraquinones have been separated from powdered rhubarb root for purposes in traditional medicine, although long-term consumption of anthraquinones has been associated with acute kidney failure.\nThe rhizomes contain stilbenoid compounds (including rhaponticin), and the flavanol glucosides (+)-catechin-5-\"O\"-glucoside and (\u2212)-catechin-7-\"O\"-glucoside.\nOxalic acid.\nRhubarb leaves contain poisonous substances, including oxalic acid, a nephrotoxin. The long term consumption of oxalic acid leads to kidney stone formation in humans. Humans have been poisoned after ingesting the leaves, a particular problem during World War I when the leaves were mistakenly recommended as a food source in Britain. The toxic rhubarb leaves have been used in flavouring extracts, after the oxalic acid is removed by treatment with precipitated chalk (i.e., calcium carbonate).\nThe LD50 (median lethal dose) for pure oxalic acid in rats is about 375\u00a0mg/kg body weight, or about 25 grams for a human. Other sources give a much higher oral LDLo (lowest published lethal dose) of 600\u00a0mg/kg. While the oxalic acid content of rhubarb leaves can vary, a typical value is about 0.5%, meaning a 65\u00a0kg adult would need to eat 4 to 8\u00a0kg (9 to 18\u00a0lbs) to obtain a lethal dose, depending on which lethal dose is assumed. Cooking the leaves with baking soda can make them more poisonous by producing soluble oxalates. The leaves are believed to also contain an additional, unidentified toxin, which might be an anthraquinone glycoside (also known as senna glycosides).\nIn the petioles (leaf stalks), the proportion of oxalic acid is about 10% of the total 2\u20132.5% acidity, which derives mainly from malic acid. Serious cases of rhubarb poisoning are not well documented. Both fatal and non-fatal cases of rhubarb poisoning may be caused not by oxalates, but rather by toxic anthraquinone glycosides.\nPests.\nRhubarb is a host to the rhubarb curculio, \"Lixus concavus\", which is a weevil. Damage is mainly visible on leaves and stalks, with gummosis and oval or circular feeding and egg-laying sites.\nHungry wildlife may dig up and eat rhubarb roots in the spring, as stored starches are turned to sugars for new foliage growth.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was originally composed as \"Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata\" in Bengali written by polymath, activist and country's first Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore on 11 December 1911. The first stanza of the song \"Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata\" was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India as the National Anthem on 24 January 1950. A formal rendition of the national anthem takes approximately 52 seconds. A shortened version consisting of the first and last lines (and taking about 20\u00a0seconds to play) is also staged occasionally. It was first publicly sung on 27 December 1911 at the Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) Session of the Indian National Congress.\nHistory.\nThe National Anthem of India is officially titled \"Jana Gana Mana\". The song was originally composed in Bengali by India's first Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore on 11 December 1911. The parent song, \"Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata\", is a Brahmo hymn that has five verses of which only the first verse was adopted as the national anthem.\nThe lyrics of the song first appeared in 5 stanzas in Bengali magazine in an issue of \"Tatwabodhini Patrika\". The melody of the song, in the \"Alhaiya Bilaval\" raga, was composed as a Brahmo hymn by Tagore himself with possibly some help from his musician grand-nephew Dinendranath Tagore. The final form of the song before the first public performance was set on 11 December 1911.\nThe song was first publicly sung on the second day of the annual session of the Indian National Congress in Kolkata on 27 December 1911 by Rabindranath Tagore's niece in her school assembly. Then, it was followed in January 1912 at the annual event of the Adi Brahmo Samaj, However, it was largely unknown except to the readers of the Adi Brahmo Samaj journal, \"Tattwabodhini Patrika\". The poem was published in January 1912, under the title \"Bharat Bhagya Bidhata\" in the Tatwabodhini Patrika, which was the official publication of the Brahmo Samaj with Tagore then the Editor.\nIn 1917, the song was again performed at the Congress conference and this time in aid of instrumental music by the Mahraja Bahadur of Nattore.\nOutside of Calcutta, the song was first sung by the bard himself at a session in Besant Theosophical College in Madanapalle, Madras (current Andhra Pradesh) on 28 February 1919 when Tagore visited the college and sang the song. The song enthralled the college students and Margaret Cousins, then vice-principal of the college (also an expert in European music and wife of Irish poet James Cousins). Based on the notes provided by Tagore himself, the song was preserved in 1919 in Western notation at Madanapalle by Margaret Cousins and her students. The whole episode was recorded by James Cousins in his autobiography \"We Two Together\":\n\"In a voice surprisingly light for so large a man, he sang something like a piece of geography giving a list of countries, mountains and rivers; and in the second verse, a list of the religions in India. The refrain to the first made us pick up our ears. The refrain to the second verse made us clear our throats. We asked for it again and again, and before long we were singing it with gusto: Jaya hai, Jaya hai, Jaya hai, Jaya JayaJayaJaya hai (Victory, victory, victory to thee). We had no idea who or what was to have the victory. The next day Rabindranath gave the swarams(notes) of \"Jana gana\" to Mrs.Cousins so that the melody should have accurate permanent record. He also made the translation of the song into English as 'The Morning Song of India'.\"\nThus, Margaret Cousins became probably the first person to transcribe and preserve Tagore's composition in Western sheet music notation at Madanapalle based on the notes provided by Tagore himself. And soon it took its place in the \"daily deciation\" of the combined school and college of Besant Hall in Madanapalle and is still sung to this date. It was also here that the song was first translated into English by Tagore as \"The Morning Song of India\".\nThe song was selected as the national anthem by Subhas Chandra Bose while he was in Germany. On the occasion of the founding meeting of the German-Indian Society on 11 September 1942 in the Hotel Atlantic in Hamburg, \"Jana Gana Mana\" was played for the first time by the Hamburg Radio Symphony Orchestra as the national anthem of India. The musical notations for this interpretation of the song were prepared by B.L. Mukherjee and Ambik Majumdar.\nBefore it officially became the national anthem of India in 1950, \"Jana Gana Mana\" was heard in the 1945 film \"Hamrahi\". It was also adopted as a school song of The Doon School, Dehradun in 1935.\nOn the occasion of India attaining freedom, the Indian Constituent Assembly assembled for the first time as a sovereign body at midnight on 14 August 1947; the session closed with a unanimous performance of \"Jana Gana Mana\".\nThe members of the Indian delegation to the General Assembly of the United Nations held in New York in 1947 gave a recording of \"Jana Gana Mana\" as the country's national anthem. The song was played by the house orchestra in front of a gathering consisting of representatives from all over the world.\nCode of conduct.\nThe National Anthem of India is played or sung on various occasions. Instructions have been issued from time to time about the correct versions of the anthem, the occasions on which these are to be played or sung and the need for paying respect to the anthem by observance of proper decorum on such occasions. The substance of these instructions has been embodied in the information sheet issued by the government of India for general information and guidance. The approximate duration of the full version of the National Anthem of India is 52 seconds; the shorter version is approximately 20 seconds.\nLyrics.\nOriginal Bengali composition.\nThe poem was composed in a literary register of the Bengali language called Sadhu Bhasha, which is heavily Sanskritised (i.e. mainly uses tatsama words).\nOfficial English lyrics.\nThe English version was translated by Rabindranath Tagore himself on 28 February 1919 at the Besant Theosophical College.\nThou art the ruler of the minds of all people,\ndispenser of India's destiny.\nThy name rouses the hearts of the Punjab, Sindh, Gujarat and Maratha;\nof the Dravida, Orissa and Bengal.\nIt echoes in the hills of the Vindhyas and Himalayas, mingles in the music of the Yamuna and Ganges\nand is chanted by the waves of the Indian Ocean.\nThey pray for Thy blessings and sing Thy praise.\nThe saving of all people waits in thy hand,\nThou dispenser of India's destiny.\nVictory, Victory, Victory to thee.\nVictory to the Lord of the minds of all the people,\nThe dispenser of India's destiny!\nPunjab, Sindh, Gujarat, Maratha,\nDravida, Odisha, Bengal;\nThe Vindhyas, Himalayas, Yamunas, the Ganges,\nThe wavering waves of the ocean all arise in your auspicious name,\nSeek your auspicious blessings, sing your victory lore.\nVictory to the graciousness of the people,\nThe dispenser of India's destiny!\nVictory! Victory! Victory!\nVictory, victory, victory, victory to you.\nAbridged version.\nA short version consisting of the first and last lines of the National Anthem is also played on certain occasions.\nRaga.\n\"Jana Gana Mana\" is sung in the Alhaiya Bilaval raga, whereby the Madhyama \"svara\" is employed.\nControversies.\nHistorical significance.\nThe composition was first sung during a convention of the Indian National Congress in Calcutta on 27 December 1911. It was sung on the second day of the convention. The event was reported as such in the British Indian press:\n\"The Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore sang a song composed by him specially to welcome the Emperor.\" (\"Statesman\", 28 December 1911)\"The proceedings began with the singing by Rabindranath Tagore of a song specially composed by him in honour of the Emperor.\" (\"Englishman\", 28 December 1911)\"When the proceedings of the Indian National Congress began on Wednesday 27 December 1911, a Bengali song in welcome of the Emperor was sung. A resolution welcoming the Emperor and Empress was also adopted unanimously.\" (\"Indian\", 29 December 1911)\nMany historians aver that the newspaper reports cited above were misguided. The confusion arose in the Indian press since a different song, \"Badshah Humara\" written in Hindi by Rambhuj Chaudhary, was sung on the same occasion in praise of George V. The nationalist press in India stated this difference of events clearly:\n\"The proceedings of the Congress party session started with a prayer in Bengali to praise God (song of benediction). This was followed by a resolution expressing loyalty to King George V. Then another song was sung welcoming King George V.\" (\"Amrita Bazar Patrika\", 28 December 1911)\"The annual session of Congress began by singing a song composed by the great Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore. Then a resolution expressing loyalty to King George V was passed. A song paying a heartfelt homage to King George V was then sung by a group of boys and girls.\" (\"The Bengalee\", 28 December 1911)\nEven the report of the annual session of the Indian National Congress of December 1911 stated this difference:\n\"On the first day of 28th annual session of the Congress, proceedings started after singing Vande Mataram. On the second day the work began after singing a patriotic song by Babu Rabindranath Tagore. Messages from well-wishers were then read and a resolution was passed expressing loyalty to King George V. Afterwards the song composed for welcoming King George V and Queen Mary was sung.\"\nOn 10 November 1937, Tagore wrote a letter to Pulin Bihari Sen about the controversy. That letter in Bengali can be found in Tagore's biography\" Rabindrajibani, volume II page 339\" by \"Prabhatkumar Mukherjee\".\n \"A certain high official in His Majesty's service, who was also my friend, had requested that I write a song of felicitation towards the Emperor. The request simply amazed me. It caused a great stir in my heart. In response to that great mental turmoil, I pronounced the victory in Jana Gana Mana of that Bhagya Bidhata [ed. God of Destiny] of India who has from age after age held steadfast the reins of India's chariot through rise and fall, through the straight path and the curved. That Lord of Destiny, that Reader of the Collective Mind of India, that Perennial Guide, could never be George V, George VI, or any other George. Even my official friend understood this about the song. After all, even if his admiration for the crown was excessive, he was not lacking in simple common sense.\"\nAgain in his letter of 19 March 1939, Tagore writes:\n\"I should only insult myself if I cared to answer those who consider me capable of such unbounded stupidity as to sing in praise of George the Fourth or George the Fifth as the Eternal Charioteer leading the pilgrims on their journey through countless ages of the timeless history of mankind.\" \"(Purvasa, Phalgun, 1354, p. 738.)\"\nThese clarifications by Tagore regarding the controversy occurred only after the death of King George V in 1936. Earlier, in 1915, after Tagore was awarded the Nobel Literature Prize, George V had conferred a knighthood on him, which he renounced in 1919 in protest over the Jallianwala Bagh massacre; writing a letter addressed to the viceroy of India Lord Chelmsford: \"The time has come when badges of honour make our shame glaring in their incongruous context of humiliation, and I for my part wish to stand, shorn of all special distinctions, by the side of my country men.\"\nSinging.\nIn Kerala, students belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses religious denomination were expelled by school authorities for their refusal to sing the national anthem on religious grounds, although they stood up when the anthem was sung. The Kerala High Court concluded that there was nothing in it which could offend anyone's religious susceptibilities, and upheld their expulsion. On 11 August 1986, the Supreme Court reversed the High Court and ruled that the High Court had misdirected itself because the question is not whether a particular religious belief or practice appeals to our reason or sentiment but whether the belief is genuinely and conscientiously held as part of the profession or practice of religion. \"Our personal views and reactions are irrelevant.\" The Supreme Court affirmed the principle that it is not for a secular judge to sit in judgment on the correctness of a religious belief.\nThe Supreme Court observed in its ruling that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; There is no provision of law which obliges anyone to sing the National Anthem nor is it disrespectful to the National Anthem if a person who stands up respectfully when the National Anthem is sung does not join the singing. Proper respect is shown to the National Anthem by standing up when the National Anthem is sung. It will not be right to say that disrespect is shown by not joining in the singing. Standing up respectfully when the National Anthem is sung but not singing oneself clearly does not either prevent the singing of the National Anthem or cause disturbance to an assembly engaged in such singing so as to constitute the offence mentioned in s. 3 of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act.\nIn some states, the anthem must be played before films are played at cinemas. On 30 November 2016, to instil \"committed patriotism and nationalism\", the Supreme Court ordered that all cinemas nationwide must play the national anthem, accompanied by an image of the flag of India, before all films. Patrons were expected to stand in respect of the anthem, and doors to a cinema hall were expected to be locked during the anthem to minimise disruption. The order was controversial, as it was argued that patrons who chose not to participate would be targeted and singled out, as was the case in an incident publicised in 2015 which purported to show a group of patrons (alleged by the YouTube uploader to be Muslims) being heckled by others. On 10 February 2017, two Kashmiris (which included an employee of the state government) were arrested under the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act for not standing during the anthem at a cinema, in the first such arrest of its kind made by a state government. On 3 July 2023, an executive magistrate in Srinagar sent 11 men to jail for a week, allegedly not rising for the anthem at a 25 June event in the presence of J&amp;K Lt Governor Manoj Sinha. Other incidents of violent outbreaks associated with the policy were also reported.\nA cinema club in Kerala (whose film festival was required to comply with the order, leading to several arrests) challenged the order as an infringement of their fundamental rights, arguing that cinemas were \"singularly unsuited for the gravitas and sobriety that must accompany the playing of the national anthem\", and that the films screened would often \"be at odds with sentiments of national respect\". In October 2017, Justice Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud questioned the intent of the order, arguing that citizens \"don't have to wear patriotism on our sleeve\", and that it should not be assumed that people who do not stand for the anthem were any less patriotic than those who did. In January 2018, the order was lifted, pending further government discussion.\nIn October 2019, a video of a Bengaluru couple being bullied for not standing up during the national anthem in a movie hall went viral. They were questioned \"Are you Pakistani?\". There was a debate on the issue; some lawyers recalled Article 21, some people called it a way to gain media attention and some recommended attending the movie after the national anthem is played to avoid any problems. But after the debate, the Supreme Court reversed its earlier order making it mandatory for cinema halls to play the National Anthem.\nRegional aspects.\nAnother controversy is that only those provinces that were under direct British rule, i.e. Punjab, Sindh, Gujarat, Maratha (Bombay Presidency), Dravida (Madras Presidency), Utkal (Orissa) and Bengal (Bengal Presidency), were mentioned. None of the princely states \u2013 Jammu and Kashmir, Rajputana, Central India Agency, Hyderabad, Mysore or the states in Northeast India (erstwhile Assam), which are now parts of India, were mentioned. However, opponents of this proposition claim that Tagore mentioned only the border states of India to include complete India. Whether the princely states would form a part of an independent Indian republic was a matter of debate even until Indian independence.\nIn 2005, there were calls to delete the word \"Sind\" and substitute it with the word Kashmir. The argument was that Sindh was no longer a part of India, having become part of Pakistan as a result of the Partition of 1947. Opponents of this proposal hold that the word \"Sind\" refers to the Indus River and Sindhi culture and that Sindhi people are a part of India's cultural fabric. The Supreme Court of India declined to change the national anthem and the wording remains unchanged.\nOn 17 December 2013, MLA of Assam, Phani Bhushan Choudhury cited an article in \"The Times of India\" published on 26 January 1950, stating that originally the word \"Kamarup\" was included in the song, but was later changed to \"Sindhu\" and claimed that Kamarup should be re-included. To this, the then minister Rockybul Hussain replied that the state government would initiate steps in this regard after a response from the newspaper. The debate was further joined by the then minister Ardhendu Dey, mentioning \"Sanchayita\" (edited by Tagore himself) etc. where he said Kamarup was not mentioned.\nIn 2017 the state government of Jharkhand under the Bharatiya Janata Party proposed making the singing of the national anthem compulsory in Madrasas. This was met with opposition from a section of Muslim clerics because it allegedly violated the basic principles of the Islamic centres of learning.\nNotable events.\nGuinness World Record.\nAs of the last retrieval, Jana Gana Mana holds the record of the most people singing a national/regional anthem simultaneously.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It consists largely of essays, interviews, and newspaper/magazine columns about technology and life experiences, but its major selling point is the inclusion of the incomplete novel on which Adams was working at the time of his death, \"The Salmon of Doubt\" (from which the collection gets its title, a reference to the Irish myth of the Salmon of Knowledge). English editions of the book were published in the United States and UK on 11 May 2002, exactly one year after the author's death.\nOriginal intention.\n\"The Salmon of Doubt\" was originally intended to be a Dirk Gently novel. The plot, set a few weeks after the events in \"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul\", involves Dirk Gently refusing to help find the missing half of a cat, receiving large amounts of money from an unknown client, and then flying to the United States. Dirk pays a visit to Kate Schechter (who had first appeared in \"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul\") and tells her that prior to the potential client, he had been so bored that he had started a habit of dialling his own phone number and discovered he'd answered his own calls.\nA faxed summary reprinted before the text mentions travelling \"through the nasal membranes of a rhinoceros, to a distant future dominated by estate agents and heavily armed kangaroos.\"\nThe version in the published book was described as the strongest content from several unfinished drafts that were written.\nLater intention.\nAdams said that while he originally planned on writing a third Dirk Gently book, the ideas which he had for it would have fitted better into another Hitchhiker's book: \"A lot of the stuff which was originally in \"The Salmon of Doubt\" really wasn't working\", and he planned on \"salvaging some of the ideas that I couldn't make work in a Dirk Gently framework and putting them in a Hitchhiker framework... and for old time's sake I may call it \"The Salmon of Doubt\".\" He had expressed dissatisfaction with the fifth \"Hitchhiker\" book, \"Mostly Harmless\", saying \"People have said, quite rightly, that \"Mostly Harmless\" is a very bleak book. And it was a bleak book. I would love to finish \"Hitchhiker\" on a slightly more upbeat note, so five seems to be a wrong kind of number; six is a better kind of number.\"\nPublished version.\nThe book as published is divided into two main sections: \"Life, the Universe and Everything\", which utilizes fiction, essays and interviews with Adams, and \"The Salmon of Doubt\", which presents the most complete version of the novel as Adams left it.\nThe first section is further subdivided into three portions. \"Life\" touches upon Adams' own life, \"The Universe\" covers Adams' views of reality, and \"Everything\" deals with a wider variety of topics. \"Everything\" also includes the short story \"The Private Life of Genghis Khan\" and the original version of the Hitchhiker's companion story \"Young Zaphod Plays It Safe\".\nThe book ends with the order of events for the memorial service that was held for Adams in September 2001, at St Martin-in-the-Fields church in London.\nEditions.\nThe UK edition includes an introduction by Stephen Fry, while the US edition includes one by Christopher Cerf. The audiobook edition consists of seven CDs, mostly read by Simon Jones, but also includes both of the introductions, read by their respective authors, as well as the tributes written and read by Richard Dawkins. US paperback editions have yet another introduction, written by Terry Jones, and omit some material due to issues with copyright.\nThe fourteenth printing of the UK/Canadian paperback, , differs in content from the ninth printing of the US hardcover edition, , in the following ways. The paperback contains a foreword written by Stephen Fry; the hardcover contains an introduction by Christopher Cerf. Adams's letter to David Vogel on page 168 has Adams's London address at the top in the hardcover, but it is missing from the paperback. \"The Private Life of Genghis Khan\" has been omitted from the paperback.\nThe US mass market paperback edition contains everything in the US hardcover edition, and adds \"An Introduction to the Introduction to the New Edition\" and an \"Introduction to the New Edition\", both by Terry Jones. The material that was omitted from the UK/Canadian paperback edition is intact in the US mass market paperback edition.\nAdaptation.\nBBC Radio 4 commissioned Above the Title Productions to produce a third Dirk Gently six-part radio series scheduled for broadcast in Autumn 2009, based on the uncompleted chapters of \"The Salmon of Doubt\" and written by Dirk Maggs, who intended to utilise early notes left behind by Adams to inform his script. In December 2008, Maggs left the project to form his own audio production company, Perfectly Normal Productions.\nIn May 2009, it was reported that \"Spice World\" writer Kim Fuller, who had originally been hired by Adams in 1998 to write a shelved Dirk Gently TV pilot, had been hired to replace Maggs on \"The Salmon of Doubt\". Fuller has subsequently denied ever having worked on the project.\nThese plans were then dropped in favour of creating a television adaptation for BBC Four.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although it can vary widely, the classic presentation occurs when severe pain from a physical trauma or neurotropic viral infection outlasts the expected recovery time, and may subsequently spread to uninjured areas. The symptoms of types 1 and 2 are the same, except type 2 is associated with nerve injury.\nUsually starting in a single limb, CRPS often first manifests as pain, swelling, limited range of motion, or partial paralysis, and/or changes to the skin and bones. It may initially affect one limb and then spread throughout the body; 35% of affected individuals report symptoms throughout the body. Two types are thought to exist: CRPS type 1 (previously referred to as \"reflex sympathetic dystrophy\") and CRPS type 2 (previously referred to as \"causalgia\"). It is possible to have both types.\nAmplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome, a condition that is similar to CRPS, primarily affects pediatric patients, falls under rheumatology and pediatrics, and is generally considered a subset of CRPS type I.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nClassification.\nThe classification system in use by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) divides CRPS into two types based on the presence or absence of measurable nerve pathophysiology.\nSigns and symptoms.\nClinical features of CRPS have been found to be inflammation resulting from the release of certain pro-inflammatory chemical signals from surrounding nerve cells; hypersensitization of pain receptors; dysfunction of local vasoconstriction and vasodilation; and maladaptive neuroplasticity.\nThe signs and symptoms of CRPS usually manifest near the injury site. The most common symptoms are extreme pain, including burning, stabbing, grinding, and throbbing. The pain is out of proportion to the severity of the initial injury. Moving or touching the limb is disproportionately painful (allodynia). Other findings are aspects of disuse including swelling, stiffness (limited range of motion), and disuse related changes to the skin (temperature, color, sweating, texture) and bones (disuse osteoporosis).\nA prior concept of CRPS having three stages is no longer in wide use. The trend is now to consider distinct sub-types of CRPS.\nCause.\nComplex regional pain syndrome is uncommon, and its cause is unclear. CRPS typically develops after an injury, surgery, heart attack, or stroke. Investigators estimate that 2\u20135% of those with peripheral nerve injury, and 13\u201370% of those with hemiplegia (paralysis of one side of the body) will develop CRPS. In addition, some studies have indicated that tobacco smoking is more often present in CRPS patients. Smoking may be involved in its pathophysiology among tobacco users by enhancing sympathetic activity, vasoconstriction, or other unknown neurotransmitter-related mechanism. This hypothesis was based on a small 1993 retrospective analysis of 53 patients with RSD, which showed that 68% of patients were smokers, compared to only 37% of the control population. The results are preliminary and are limited by their retrospective nature. A minority (7%) of individuals with CRPS in a single limb go on to develop it in another.\nPathophysiology.\nInflammation and alteration of pain perception in the central nervous system are proposed to play important roles. The persistent pain and the perception of nonpainful stimuli as painful are thought to be caused by inflammatory molecules (IL-1, IL-2, TNF-alpha) and neuropeptides (substance P) released from peripheral nerves. This release may be caused by inappropriate cross-talk between sensory and motor fibers at the affected site. CRPS is not a psychological illness, yet pain can cause psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression. Often, impaired social and occupational function occur.\nComplex regional pain syndrome is a multifactorial disorder with clinical features of neurogenic inflammation (inflammation mediated by nerve cells), nociceptive sensitisation (which causes extreme sensitivity or allodynia), vasomotor dysfunction (blood flow problems which cause swelling and discolouration) and maladaptive neuroplasticity (where the brain changes and adapts with constant pain signals); CRPS is the result of an \"aberrant [inappropriate] response to tissue injury\". The \"underlying neuronal matrix\" of CRPS is seen to involve cognitive and motor as well as nociceptive processing; pinprick stimulation of a CRPS affected limb was painful (mechanical hyperalgesia) and showed a \"significantly increased activation\" of not just the S1 cortex (contralateral), S2 (bilateral) areas, and insula (bilateral) but also the associative-somatosensory cortices (contralateral), frontal cortices, and parts of the anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast to previous thoughts reflected in the name RSD, it appears that there is reduced sympathetic nervous system outflow, at least in the affected region (although there may be sympatho-afferent coupling). Wind-up (the increased sensation of pain with time) and central nervous system (CNS) sensitization are key neurologic processes that appear to be involved in the induction and maintenance of CRPS.\nCompelling evidence shows that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has significant involvement in the CNS sensitization process. It is also hypothesized that elevated CNS glutamate levels promote wind-up and CNS sensitization. In addition, there exists experimental evidence demonstrating the presence of NMDA receptors in peripheral nerves. Because immunological functions can modulate CNS physiology, a variety of immune processes have also been hypothesized to contribute to the initial development and maintenance of peripheral and central sensitization. Furthermore, trauma-related cytokine release, exaggerated neurogenic inflammation, sympathetic afferent coupling, adrenoreceptor pathology, glial cell activation, cortical reorganisation, and oxidative damage (e.g., by free radicals) are all factors which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of CRPS. In addition, autoantibodies are present in a wide number of CRPS patients and IgG has been recognized as one of the causes of hypersensitivity that stimulates A and C nociceptors, attributing to the inflammation.\nThe mechanisms leading to reduced bone mineral density (up to overt osteoporosis) are still unknown. Potential explanations include a dysbalance of the activities of sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and mild secondary hyperparathyroidism. However, the trigger of secondary hyperparathyroidism has not yet been identified.\nIn summary, the pathophysiology of complex regional pain syndrome has not yet been defined; CRPS, with its variable manifestations, could be the result of multiple pathophysiological processes.\nDiagnosis.\nDiagnosis is primarily based on clinical findings. The original diagnostic criteria for CRPS adopted by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) in 1994 have now been superseded in both clinical practice and research by the \"Budapest Criteria\" which were created in 2003 and have been found to be more sensitive and specific. They have since been adopted by the IASP. The criteria require there to be pain as well as a history and clinical evidence of sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor, and motor or trophic changes. It is also stated that it is a diagnosis of exclusion.\nTo make a clinical diagnosis all four of the following criteria must be met:\nDiagnostic adjuncts.\nNo specific test is available for CRPS, which is diagnosed primarily through observation of the symptoms. However, thermography, sweat testing, X-rays, electrodiagnostics, and sympathetic blocks can be used to build up a picture of the disorder. Diagnosis is complicated by the fact that some patients improve without treatment. A delay in diagnosis and/or treatment for this syndrome can result in severe physical and psychological problems. Early recognition and prompt treatment provide the greatest opportunity for recovery.\nThermography.\nPresently, established empirical evidence suggests against thermography's efficacy as a reliable tool for diagnosing CRPS. Although CRPS may, in some cases, lead to measurably altered blood flow throughout an affected region, many other factors can also contribute to an altered thermographic reading, including the patient's smoking habits, use of certain skin lotions, recent physical activity, and prior history of trauma to the region. Also, not all patients diagnosed with CRPS demonstrate such \"vasomotor instability\"\u2014particularly those in the later stages of the disease. Thus, thermography alone cannot be used as conclusive evidence for\u2014or against\u2014a diagnosis of CRPS and must be interpreted in light of the patient's larger medical history and prior diagnostic studies.\nIn order to minimise the confounding influence of external factors, patients undergoing infrared thermographic testing must conform to special restrictions regarding the use of certain vasoconstrictors (namely, nicotine and caffeine), skin lotions, physical therapy, and other diagnostic procedures in the days prior to testing. Patients may also be required to discontinue certain pain medications and sympathetic blockers. After a patient arrives at a thermographic laboratory, he or she is allowed to reach thermal equilibrium in a , draft-free, steady-state room wearing a loose fitting cotton hospital gown for approximately twenty minutes. A technician then takes infrared images of both the patient's affected and unaffected limbs, as well as reference images of other parts of the patient's body, including his or her face, upper back, and lower back. After capturing a set of baseline images, some labs further require the patient to undergo cold-water autonomic-functional-stress-testing to evaluate the function of their autonomic nervous system's peripheral vasoconstrictor reflex. This is performed by placing a patient's unaffected limb in a cold water bath (approximately ) for five minutes while collecting images. In a normal, intact, functioning autonomic nervous system, a patient's affected extremity will become colder. Conversely, warming of an affected extremity may indicate a disruption of the body's normal thermoregulatory vasoconstrictor function, which may sometimes indicate underlying CRPS.\nRadiography.\nScintigraphy, plain radiographs, and magnetic resonance imaging may all be useful diagnostically. Patchy osteoporosis (post-traumatic osteoporosis), which may be due to disuse of the affected extremity, can be detected through X-ray imagery as early as two weeks after the onset of CRPS. A bone scan of the affected limb may detect these changes even sooner and can almost confirm the disease. Bone densitometry can also be used to detect changes in bone mineral density. It can also be used to monitor the results of treatment since bone densitometry parameters improve with treatment.\nUltrasound.\nUltrasound-based osteodensitometry (ultrasonometry) may be a potential future radiation-free technique to identify reduced bone mineral density in CRPS. Additionally, this method promises to quantify the bone architecture in the periphery of affected limbs. This method is still under experimental development.\nElectrodiagnostic testing.\nElectromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) are important ancillary tests in CRPS because they are among the most reliable methods of detecting nerve injury. They can be used as one of the primary methods to distinguish between CRPS types I and II, which differ based on evidence of actual nerve damage. EMG and NCS are also among the best tests for ruling in or out alternative diagnoses. CRPS is a \"diagnosis of exclusion\", which requires that no other diagnosis can explain the patient's symptoms. This is very important to emphasise because patients otherwise can be given a wrong diagnosis of CRPS when they actually have a treatable condition that better accounts for their symptoms. An example is severe carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), which can often present in a very similar way to CRPS. Unlike CRPS, CTS can often be corrected with surgery to alleviate the pain and avoid permanent nerve damage and malformation.\nBoth EMG and NCS involve some measure of discomfort. EMG involves the use of a tiny needle inserted into specific muscles to test the associated muscle and nerve function. Both EMG and NCS involve very mild shocks that in normal patients are comparable to a rubber band snapping on the skin. Although these tests can be very useful in CRPS, thorough informed consent must be obtained prior to the procedure, particularly in patients experiencing severe allodynia. In spite of the utility of the test, these patients may wish to decline the procedure to avoid discomfort.\nClassification.\nPatients are frequently classified into two groups based upon temperature: \"warm\" or \"hot\" CRPS in one group and \"cold\" CRPS in the other group. The majority of patients (about 70%) have the \"hot\" type, which is said to be an acute form of CRPS. Cold CRPS is said to be indicative of a more chronic CRPS and is associated with poorer McGill Pain Questionnaire scores, increased central nervous system reorganisation, and a higher prevalence of dystonia. Prognosis is not favourable for cold CRPS patients; longitudinal studies suggest these patients have \"poorer clinical pain outcomes and show persistent signs of central sensitisation correlating with disease progression\".\nPrevention.\nVitamin C supplementation may be useful in prevention of the syndrome following fracture of the forearm, foot, or ankle.\nTreatment.\nTreatment of CRPS often involves a number of modalities.\nTherapy.\nPhysical and occupational therapy have low-quality evidence to support their use. Physical therapy interventions may include transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, progressive weight bearing, graded tactile desensitization, massage, and contrast bath therapy. In a retrospective cohort (unblinded, non-randomized, and with intention-to-treat) of fifty patients diagnosed with CRPS, patients' subjective pain and body perception scores decreased after engagement with a two-week multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. The authors call for randomized controlled trials to probe the true value of interdisciplinary programs for CRPS patients.\nMirror box therapy.\nMirror box therapy uses a mirror box, or a stand-alone mirror, to reflect the normal limb so that the patient thinks they are looking at the affected limb. Movement of this reflected normal limb is then performed so that it seems to the patient as though they are performing movement with the affected limb. Mirror box therapy appears to be beneficial at least in early CRPS. However, the beneficial effects of mirror therapy in the long term are still unproven.\nGraded motor imagery.\nGraded motor imagery appears to be useful for people with CRPS-1. Graded motor imagery is a sequential process that consists of (a) laterality reconstruction, (b) motor imagery, and (c) mirror therapy.\nTranscutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)\nTranscutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is a therapy that uses low-voltage electrical signals to provide pain relief through electrodes that are placed on the surface of the skin. Evidence supports its use in treating pain and edema associated with CRPS, but it does not seem to increase functional ability in CRPS patients.\nMedications.\nTentative evidence supports the use of bisphosphonates, calcitonin, and ketamine. Nerve blocks with guanethidine appear to be harmful. Evidence for sympathetic nerve blocks generally is insufficient to support their use. Intramuscular botulinum injections may benefit people with symptoms localized to one extremity.\nKetamine.\nKetamine, a dissociative anesthetic, appears promising as a treatment for CRPS. It may be used in low doses if other treatments have not worked. No benefit on either function or depression, however, has been seen.\nBisphosphonate treatment.\nAs of 2013, high-quality evidence supports the use of bisphosphonates (either orally or via IV infusion) in the treatment of CRPS. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclasts: cells involved in the resorption of bone. Bone remodeling (via osteoclast activity in bone resorption) is sometimes thought to be hyperactive in CRPS. It is hypothesized that bone resorption causes acidification of the intercellular milieu, which, in turn, activates nerves involved in nociception that densely innervate bone and cause pain. Therefore, inhibiting bone resorption and remodeling is thought to help with regard to CRPS pain. CRPS involving high levels of bone resorption, as seen on bone scan, is more likely to respond to bisphosphonate therapy.\nOpioids.\nOpioids such as oxycodone, morphine, hydrocodone, and fentanyl have a controversial place in the treatment of CRPS. These drugs must be prescribed and monitored under close supervision of a physician as they can quickly lead to physical dependence and addiction. To date so far, no long-term studies of oral opioid use in treating neuropathic pain, including CRPS, have been performed. The consensus among experts is that opioids should not be a first-line therapy and should be considered only after all other modalities (e.g., non-opioid medications, physical therapy, and procedures) have been trialed.\nSurgery.\nSpinal cord stimulators.\nSpinal cord stimulation appears to be an effective therapy in the management of patients with CRPS type I (level A evidence) and type II (level D evidence). Although they improve patient pain and quality of life, evidence regarding their effects on mental health and general functioning is unclear.\nDorsal root ganglion stimulation is a type of neurostimulation effective in managing focal neuropathic pain. The FDA approved its use in February 2016. The ACCURATE Study demonstrated superiority of dorsal root ganglion stimulation over spinal (dorsal column) stimulation in the management of CRPS and causalgia.\nSympathectomy.\nSurgical, chemical, or radiofrequency sympathectomy\u2014interruption of the affected portion of the sympathetic nervous system\u2014can be used as a last resort in patients with impending tissue loss, edema, recurrent infection, or ischemic necrosis. However, little evidence supports these permanent interventions to alter the pain symptoms of the affected patients, and in addition to the normal risks of surgery, such as bleeding and infection, sympathectomy has several specific risks, such as adverse changes in how nerves function.\nAmputation.\nNo randomized study in the medical literature has studied the response to amputation of patients who have failed the therapies mentioned above and who continue to be in pain. Nonetheless, on average, about half of the patients will have resolution of their pain, while half will develop phantom limb pain and/or pain at the amputation site. As in any other chronic pain syndrome, the brain likely becomes chronically stimulated with pain, and late amputation may not work as well as it might be expected. In a survey of 15 patients with CRPS type 1, 11 responded that their lives were better after amputation.\nOther.\nCannabidiol, despite evidence of very low quality, is proposed to relieve pain.\nPrognosis.\nThe prognosis of CRPS is improved with early and aggressive treatment, with the risk of chronic, debilitating pain being reduced with the early treatment. If treatment is delayed, however, the disorder can quickly spread to the entire limb, and changes in bone, nerve, and muscle may become irreversible. The prognosis worsens with the chronic \"cold\" form of CRPS and CRPS affecting the upper extremities. Inactivity of the limb following an injury, whether due to pain or recovery or, in some instances, psychological distress after the injury, can lead to deconditioning. The absence of movement contributes to muscle atrophy, swelling, joint stiffness and pain, and reduced circulation, among other processes. This sequence of physiological changes not only intensifies the symptoms of CRPS but is also associated with a less favorable prognosis. Some cases of CRPS may resolve spontaneously, with 74% of patients in a Minnesota study experiencing complete symptom resolution, while others may have chronic or relapsing-and-remitting disease. Once one is diagnosed with CRPS, should it go into remission, the likelihood of it resurfacing after remission is considerable. Taking precautions and seeking immediate treatment upon any injury is important.\nEpidemiology.\nCRPS can occur at any age, with the average age at diagnosis being 42. It affects both men and women; however, CRPS is three times more frequent in females than males.\nCRPS affects both adults and children, and the number of reported CRPS cases among adolescents and young adults has been increasing, with a recent observational study finding an incidence of 1.16/100,000 among children in Scotland.\nHistory.\nThe condition currently known as CRPS was originally described by Ambroise Par\u00e9, who treated a severe and persistent pain syndrome suffered by Charles IX of France after a limb phlebotomy. Silas Weir Mitchell is sometimes credited with inventing the name \"causalgia\" during the American Civil War. However, the term was actually coined by Mitchell's friend Robley Dunglison from the Greek words for \"heat\" and \"pain\". Causalgia, linked to neurological lesions, is significantly influenced by vasomotor and sudomotor symptoms. In the 1940s, the term \"reflex sympathetic dystrophy\" was introduced, highlighting the role of sympathetic hyperactivity in its pathophysiology. In 1959, Noordenbos observed in causalgia patients that \"the damage of the nerve is always partial.\" Misuse of the terms, as well as doubts about the underlying pathophysiology, led to calls for better nomenclature. In 1993, a special consensus workshop held in Orlando, Florida, provided the umbrella term \"complex regional pain syndrome\", with causalgia and reflex sympathetic dystrophy as subtypes.\nResearch.\nThe National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), a part of the National Institutes of Health, supports and conducts research on the brain and central nervous system, including research relevant to RSDS, through grants to major medical institutions across the country. NINDS-supported scientists are working to develop effective treatments for neurological conditions and ultimately, to find ways of preventing them. Investigators are studying new approaches to treat CRPS and intervene more aggressively after traumatic injury to lower the patient's chances of developing the disorder. In addition, NINDS-supported scientists are studying how signals of the sympathetic nervous system cause pain in CRPS patients. Using a technique called microneurography, these investigators are able to record and measure neural activity in single nerve fibers of affected patients. By testing various hypotheses, these researchers hope to discover the unique mechanism that causes the spontaneous pain of CRPS, and that discovery may lead to new ways of blocking pain. Other studies to overcome chronic pain syndromes are discussed in the pamphlet \"Chronic Pain: Hope Through Research\", published by the NINDS.\nResearch into treating the condition with mirror visual feedback is being undertaken at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Disease in Bath. Patients are taught how to desensitize in the most effective way, then progress to using mirrors to rewrite the faulty signals in the brain that appear responsible for this condition. However, while CRPS can go into remission, the chance of it reoccurring is significant.\nThe Netherlands has the most comprehensive program of research into CRPS, as part of a multimillion-Euro initiative called TREND. German and Australian research teams are also pursuing better understanding and treatments for CRPS.\nIn other animal species.\nCRPS has also been described in non-human animals, such as cattle.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The company produced a number of computers during the 1980s with associated software that were highly popular in the domestic market, and they have been historically influential in the development of computer technology like processors.\nThe company's Acorn Electron, released in 1983, and the later Acorn Archimedes, were highly popular in Britain, while Acorn's BBC Micro computer dominated the educational computer market during the 1980s. The company also designed the ARM architecture and the RISC OS operating system for it. The architecture part of the business was spun-off as Advanced RISC Machines under a joint venture with Apple and VLSI in 1990, now known as Arm Holdings, which is dominant in the mobile phone and personal digital assistant (PDA) microprocessor market today.\nAcorn in the 1990s released the Risc PC line and the Acorn Network Computer, and also had a stint in the set-top box and educational markets. However, financial troubles led to the company closing down its workstation division in September 1998, effectively halting its home computer business and cancelling development of RISC OS and the Phoebe computer. The company was acquired and largely dismantled in early 1999. In retrospect, Acorn is sometimes referred to as the \"British Apple\" and has been compared to Fairchild Semiconductor for being a catalyst for start-ups.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nOn 25 July 1961, Clive Sinclair founded Sinclair Radionics to develop and sell electronic devices such as calculators. The failure of the \"Black Watch\" wristwatch and the calculator market's move from LEDs to LCDs led to financial problems, and Sinclair approached a government body, the National Enterprise Board (NEB), for help. After losing control of the company to the NEB, Sinclair encouraged Chris Curry to leave Radionics and get Science of Cambridge (SoC\u2014an early name for Sinclair Research) up and running. In June 1978, SoC launched a microcomputer kit, the MK14, that Curry wanted to develop further, but Sinclair could not be persuaded so Curry resigned. During the development of the MK14, Hermann Hauser, a friend of Curry's, had been visiting SoC's offices and had grown interested in the product.\nCPU Ltd. (1978\u20131983).\nCurry and Hauser decided to pursue their joint interest in microcomputers and, on 5 December 1978, they set up Cambridge Processor Unit Ltd. (CPU) as the vehicle with which to do this. CPU soon obtained a consultancy contract to develop a microprocessor-based controller for a fruit machine for Ace Coin Equipment (ACE) of Wales. The ACE project was started at office space obtained at 4a Market Hill in Cambridge. Initially, the ACE controller was based on a National Semiconductor SC/MP microprocessor, but soon the switch to a MOS Technology 6502 was made.\nThe microcomputer systems.\nCPU had financed the development of a SC/MP based microcomputer system using the income from its design-and-build consultancy.\nThis system was launched in January 1979 as the first product of Acorn Computer Ltd., a trading name used by CPU to keep the risks of the two different lines of business separate. Acorn was chosen because the microcomputer system was to be expandable and growth-oriented. It also had the attraction of appearing before \"Apple Computer\" in a telephone directory.\nAround this time, CPU and Andy Hopper set up \"Orbis Ltd.\" to commercialise the Cambridge Ring networking system Hopper had worked on for his PhD, but it was soon decided to bring him into CPU as a director because he could promote CPU's interests at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory.\nCPU purchased Orbis, and Hopper's Orbis shares were exchanged for shares in CPU Ltd. CPU's role gradually changed as its Acorn brand grew, and soon CPU was simply the holding company and Acorn was responsible for development work.\nAt some point, Curry had a disagreement with Sinclair and formally left Science of Cambridge, but did not join the other Acorn employees at Market Hill until a little while later.\nThe Acorn Microcomputer, later renamed the Acorn System 1, was designed by Sophie Wilson. It was a semi-professional system aimed at engineering and laboratory users, but its price was low enough, at around \u00a380 (), to appeal to the more serious enthusiast as well. It was a very small machine built on two cards, one with an LED display, keypad, and cassette interface (the circuitry to the left of the keypad), and the other with the rest of the computer (including the CPU). Almost all CPU signals were accessible via a Eurocard connector.\nThe System 2 made it easier to expand the system by putting the CPU card from the System 1 in a Eurocard rack that allowed a number of optional additions. The System 2 typically shipped with keyboard controller, external keyboard, a text display interface, and a cassette operating system with built-in BASIC interpreter.\nThe System 3 moved on by adding floppy disk support, and the System 4 by including a larger case with a second drive. The System 5 was largely similar to the System 4, but included a newer 2\u00a0MHz version of the 6502.\nThe Atom.\nDevelopment of the Sinclair ZX80 started at Science of Cambridge in May 1979. Learning of this probably prompted Curry to conceive the Atom project to target the consumer market. Curry and another designer, Nick Toop, worked from Curry's home in the Fens on the development of this machine. It was at this time that Acorn Computers Ltd. was incorporated and Curry moved to Acorn full-time.\nIt was Curry who wanted to target the consumer market. Other factions within Acorn, including the engineers, were happy to be out of that market, considering a home computer to be a rather frivolous product for a company operating in the laboratory equipment market.\nTo keep costs down and not give the doubters reason to object to the Atom, Curry asked industrial designer Allen Boothroyd to design a case that could also function as an external keyboard for the microcomputer systems.\nThe internals of the System 3 were placed inside the keyboard, creating a quite typical set-up for an inexpensive home computer of the early 1980s: the relatively successful Acorn Atom.\nTo facilitate software development, a proprietary local area network had been installed at Market Hill. It was decided to include this, the Econet, in the Atom, and at its launch at a computer show in March 1980, eight networked Atoms were demonstrated with functions that allowed files to be shared, screens to be remotely viewed and keyboards to be remotely slaved.\nBBC Micro and the Electron.\nAfter the Atom had been released into the market, Acorn contemplated building modern 16-bit processors to replace the Atom. After a great deal of discussion, Hauser suggested a compromise\u2014an improved 6502-based machine with far greater expansion capabilities: the Proton. Acorn's technical staff had not wanted to do the Atom and they now saw the Proton as their opportunity to \"do it right\".\nOne of the developments proposed for the Proton was the \"Tube\", a proprietary interface allowing a second processor to be added. This compromise would make for an affordable 6502 machine for the mass market which could be expanded with more sophisticated and expensive processors. The Tube enabled processing to be farmed out to the second processor leaving the 6502 to perform data input/output (I/O). The Tube would later be instrumental in the development of Acorn's ARM processor.\nIn early 1980, the BBC Further Education department conceived the idea of a computer literacy programme, mostly as a follow-up to an ITV documentary, \"The Mighty Micro\", in which Dr Christopher Evans from the UK National Physical Laboratory predicted the coming microcomputer revolution. It was a very influential documentary\u2014so much so that questions were asked in Parliament. As a result of these questions, the Department of Industry (DoI) became interested in the programme, as did BBC Enterprises, which saw an opportunity to sell a machine to go with the series. BBC Engineering was instructed to draw up an objective specification for a computer to accompany the series.\nEventually, under some pressure from the DoI to choose a British system, the BBC chose the NewBrain from Newbury Laboratories. This selection revealed the extent of the pressure brought to bear on the supposedly independent BBC's computer literacy project\u2014Newbury was owned by the National Enterprise Board, a government agency operating in close collaboration with the DoI. The choice was also somewhat ironic given that the NewBrain started life as a Sinclair Radionics project, and it was Sinclair's preference for developing it over Science of Cambridge's MK14 that led to Curry leaving SoC to found CPU with Hauser. The NEB moved the NewBrain to Newbury after Sinclair left Radionics and went to SoC.\nIn 1980\u20131982, the British Department of Education and Science (DES) had begun the Microelectronics Education Programme to introduce microprocessing concepts and educational materials. In 1981, through to 1986, the DoI allocated funding to assist UK local education authorities to supply their schools with a range of computers, the BBC Micro being one of the most popular. Schools were offered 50% of the cost of computers, providing they chose one of three models: BBC Micro, ZX Spectrum or Research Machines 380Z. In parallel, the DES continued to fund more materials for the computers, such as software and applied computing projects, plus teacher training.\nAlthough the NewBrain was under heavy development by Newbury, it soon became clear that they were not going to be able to produce it\u2014certainly not in time for the literacy programme nor to the BBC's specification. The BBC's programmes, initially scheduled for autumn 1981, were moved back to spring 1982. After Curry and Sinclair found out about the BBC's plans, the BBC allowed other manufacturers to submit their proposals. Hauser quickly drafted in Steve Furber (who had been working for Acorn on a voluntary basis since the ACE fruit machine project) and Sophie Wilson to help complete a revised version of the Proton which met the BBC's specifications. BBC visited Acorn and were given a demonstration of the Proton. Shortly afterwards, the literacy programme computer contract was awarded to Acorn, and the Proton was launched in December 1981 as the BBC Micro. In April 1984, Acorn won the Queen's Award for Technology for the BBC Micro. The award paid special tribute to the BBC Micro's advanced design, and it commended Acorn \"for the development of a microcomputer system with many innovative features\".\nIn April 1982, Sinclair launched the ZX Spectrum. Curry conceived of the Electron as Acorn's sub-\u00a3200 competitor. In many ways a cut-down BBC Micro, it used one Acorn-designed uncommitted logic array (ULA) to reproduce most of the functionality. But problems in producing the ULAs led to short supply, and the Electron, although launched in August 1983, was not on the market in sufficient numbers to capitalise on the 1983 Christmas sales period. Acorn resolved to avoid this problem in 1984 and negotiated new production contracts. Acorn became more known for its BBC Micro model B than for its other products.\nIn 2008, the Computer Conservation Society organised an event at London's Science Museum to mark the legacy of the BBC Micro. A number of the BBC Micro's principal creators were present, and Sophie Wilson recounted to the BBC how Hermann Hauser tricked her and Steve Furber to agree to create the physical prototype in less than five days. Also in 2008 a number of former staff organised a reunion event to mark the 30th anniversary of the company's formation.\n1983\u20131985: Acorn Computer Group.\nThe BBC Micro sold well\u2014so much so that Acorn's profits rose from \u00a33000 in 1979 to \u00a38.6 million in July 1983. In September 1983, CPU shares were liquidated and Acorn was floated on the Unlisted Securities Market as \"Acorn Computer Group plc\", with Acorn Computers Ltd. as the microcomputer division. With a minimum tender price of 120p, the group came into existence with a market capitalisation of about \u00a3135 million. CPU founders Hermann Hauser and Chris Curry's stakes in the new company were worth \u00a364m and \u00a351m, respectively. Ten per cent of the equity was placed on the market, with the money raised from the flotation \"mainly\" directed towards establishing US and German subsidiaries (the flotation raising around \u00a313.4 million), although some was directed towards research and product development.\nBy the end of 1984, Acorn Computer Group was organised into several subsidiary companies. \"Acorn Computers Limited\" was responsible for the management of the microcomputer business, research and development, and UK sales and marketing, whereas \"Acorn Computer Corporation\" and \"Acorn Computers International Limited\" dealt with sales to the US and to other international markets respectively. \"Acorn Computers (Far East) Limited\" focused on component procurement and manufacturing with some distribution responsibilities in local markets. \"Acornsoft Limited\" was responsible for development, production and marketing of software for Acorn's computer range. \"Vector Marketing Limited\" was established to handle distribution-related logistics and the increasing customer support burden. As part of Acorn's office automation aspirations, conducting \"advanced software research and development\", \"Acorn Research Center Incorporated\" was established in Palo Alto, California. \"Acorn Leasing Limited\" rounded out the portfolio.\nNew RISC architecture.\nEven from the time of Acorn's earliest systems, the company was considering how to move on from the 6502 processor, introducing a Motorola 6809 processor card for its System 3 and System 4 models. Several years later in 1985, the Acorn Communicator employed the 16-bit 65816 processor as a step up from the 6502.\nThe IBM PC was launched on 12 August 1981. Although a version of that machine was aimed at the enthusiast market much like the BBC Micro, its real area of success was business. The successor to the PC, the XT (eXtended Technology) was introduced in early 1983. The success of these machines and the variety of Z80-based CP/M machines in the business sector demonstrated that it was a viable market, especially given that sector's ability to cope with premium prices. The development of a business machine looked like a good idea to Acorn. A development programme was started to create a business computer using Acorn's existing technology: the BBC Micro mainboard, the Tube and second processors to give CP/M, MS-DOS and Unix (Xenix) workstations.\nThis \"Acorn Business Computer\" (ABC) plan required a number of second processors to be made to work with the BBC Micro platform. In developing these, Acorn had to implement the Tube protocols on each processor chosen, in the process finding out, during 1983, that there were no obvious candidates to replace the 6502. Because of many-cycle uninterruptible instructions, for example, the interrupt response times of the Motorola 68000 were too slow to handle the communication protocol that the host 6502-based BBC Micro coped with easily. The National Semiconductor 32016-based model of the ABC range, was developed and later sold in 1985 as the Cambridge Workstation (using the Panos operating system). Advertising for this machine in 1986 included an illustration of an office worker using the workstation. The advert claimed mainframe power at a price of \u00a33,480 (excluding VAT). The main text of the advertisement referred to available mainframe languages, communication capabilities and the alternative option of upgrading a BBC Micro using a coprocessor. The machine had shown Sophie Wilson and Steve Furber the value of memory bandwidth. It also showed that an 8\u00a0MHz 32016 was completely trounced in performance terms by a 4\u00a0MHz 6502. Furthermore, the Apple Lisa had shown the Acorn engineers that they needed to develop a windowing system; this was not going to be easy with a 2\u20134\u00a0MHz 6502-based system doing the graphics. Acorn would need a new architecture.\nAcorn had investigated all of the readily available processors and found them wanting or unavailable to them. After testing all of the available processors and finding them lacking, Acorn decided that it needed a new architecture. Inspired by white papers on the Berkeley RISC project, Acorn seriously considered designing its own processor. A visit to the Western Design Center in the US, where the 6502 was being updated by what was effectively a single-person company, showed Acorn engineers Steve Furber and Sophie Wilson they did not need massive resources and state-of-the-art research and development facilities.\nSophie Wilson set about developing the instruction set, writing a simulation of the processor in BBC BASIC that ran on a BBC Micro with a 6502 second processor. It convinced the Acorn engineers that they were on the right track. Before they could go any further, however, they would need more resources. It was time for Wilson to approach Hauser and explain what was afoot. Once the go-ahead had been given, a small team was put together to implement Wilson's model in hardware.\n\"Acorn\" initiated its RISC research project in October 1983, and by 1987 had spent \u00a35 million. VLSI Technology, Inc were chosen as silicon partner, since they already supplied Acorn with ROMs and some custom chips. VLSI produced the first ARM silicon on 26 April 1985; it worked first time and came to be known as ARM1. Its first practical application was as a second processor to the BBC Micro, where it was used to develop the simulation software to finish work on the support chips (VIDC, IOC, MEMC) and to speed up the operation of the CAD software used in developing ARM2. The ARM evaluation system was promoted as a means for developers to try the system for themselves. This system was used with a BBC Micro and a PC compatible version was also planned. Advertising was aimed at those with technical expertise, rather than consumers and the education market, with a number of technical specifications listed in the main text of the adverts. Wilson subsequently coded BBC BASIC in ARM assembly language, and the in-depth knowledge obtained from designing the instruction set allowed the code to be very dense, making ARM BBC BASIC an extremely good test for any ARM emulator.\nSuch was the secrecy surrounding the ARM CPU project that when Olivetti were negotiating to take a controlling share of Acorn in 1985, they were not told about the development team until after the negotiations had been finalised. In 1992, Acorn once more won the Queen's Award for Technology for the ARM. Acorn's development of their RISC OS operating system required around 200 OS development staff at its peak. Acorn C/C++ was released commercially by Acorn, for developers to use to compile their own applications.\nFinancial problems.\nHaving become a publicly traded company in 1983 during the home computer boom, Acorn's commercial performance in 1984 proved to be consequential. Many home computer manufacturers struggled to maintain customer enthusiasm, some offering unconvincing follow-up products that failed to appeal to buyers. The more successful manufacturers, like Amstrad, emphasised the bundling of computers with essential peripherals such as monitors and cassette recorders along with value for money. The collapse of the market from the manufacturers' perspective, it was argued, was due to the \"neglect of the market by the manufacturers\". Market adversity had led to Atari being sold, and Apple nearly went bankrupt.\nThe Electron had been launched in 1983, but problems with the supply of its ULA meant that Acorn was not able to capitalise on the 1983 Christmas selling period. A successful advertising campaign, including TV advertisements, had led to 300,000 orders, but the Malaysian suppliers were only able to supply 30,000 machines. The apparently strong demand for Electrons proved to be ephemeral: rather than wait, parents bought Commodore 64 or ZX Spectrum for their children's presents. Ferranti solved the production problem and in 1984, production reached its anticipated volumes, but the contracts Acorn had negotiated with its suppliers were not flexible enough to allow volumes to be reduced quickly in this unanticipated situation, and supplies of the Electron built up. At the time of the eventual financial rescue of Acorn in early 1985, it still had 100,000 unsold Electrons plus an inventory of components which had all been paid for and needed to be stored at additional expense. 40,000 BBC Micros also remained unsold.\nAfter a disappointing summer season in 1984, Acorn had evidently focused on making up for lost sales over the Christmas season, with the Electron being a particular focus. However, a refusal to discount the BBC Micro also appeared to inhibit sales of that machine, with some dealers expressing dissatisfaction to the point of considering abandoning the range altogether. With rumours of another, potentially cheaper, machine coming from Acorn, dealers eventually started to discount heavily after Christmas. For instance, high street retailer Rumbelows sought to clear unsold Christmas stocks of around 1500 machines priced at \u00a3299, offering a discount of around \u00a3100, also bundling them with a cassette recorder and software. The rumoured machine turned out to be the BBC Model B+ which was a relatively conservative upgrade and more, not less, expensive than the machine it replaced. It was speculated that the perception of a more competitive machine soon to be launched might well have kept potential purchasers away from the products that Acorn needed to sell.\nAcorn was also spending a large portion of its reserves on development: the BBC Master was being developed; the ARM project was underway; the Acorn Business Computer entailed a lot of development work but delivered few products, with only the 32016-based model ever being sold (as the Cambridge Workstation). The company's research and development staff had grown from around 100 in 1983 to around 150 in 1984, the latter out of a total of 450 employees. Meanwhile, Acorn's chosen method of expansion into West Germany and the United States through the establishment of subsidiaries involved a \"major commitment of resources\", in contrast with a less costly strategy that might have emphasised collaboration with local distributors. Localisation of the BBC Micro for the US market also involved more expenditure than it otherwise might have due to a failure to consider local market conditions and preferences, with \"complex technical efforts\" having been made to make the machine compatible with US television standards when local market information would have indicated that \"US home computer users expect to use a dedicated personal computer monitor\". Consequently, obtaining Federal approval for the BBC Micro in order to expand into the United States proved to be a drawn-out and expensive process that proved futile: all of the expansion devices that were intended to be sold with the BBC Micro had to be tested and radiation emissions had to be reduced. It was claimed that Acorn spent \u00a310 million on its US operation without this localised variant of the BBC Micro establishing a significant market share. The machine, however, did make an appearance in the school of \"Supergirl\" in the 1984 film \"Supergirl: The Movie\".\nAcorn also made or attempted various acquisitions. The Computer Education in Schools division of ICL was acquired by Acorn in late 1983 \"reportedly for less than \u00a3100,000\", transferring a staff of six to Acorn's Maidenhead office to form Acorn's Educational Services division and to provide \"the core of education support development within Acorn\". Having had a close relationship with Torch Computers in the early 1980s, Acorn sought to acquire Torch in 1984 with the intention of making Torch \"effectively the business arm\" of Acorn, despite a lack of clarity about competing product lines and uncertainty about the future of Acorn's still-unreleased business machine within any rationalised product range, although this acquisition was never completed, with Torch having pulled out as Acorn's situation deteriorated.\nAt around the same time, Acorn also bought into Torus Systems - a company developing a \"graphics-controlled local network called Icon\" for the IBM PC platform - to broaden Acorn's networking expertise. Icon was a solution based on Ethernet, as opposed to the Acorn-related Econet and Cambridge Ring technologies, equipping appropriately specified IBM-compatible computers to participate on a network using a relatively low-cost Ethernet interface card utilising Intel's 82586 network controller chip. Torus later released a network management solution called Tapestry, based on Icon and marketed by IBM for its own networking technologies. Torus also released support for the use of Novell's Advanced Netware product on its own networking hardware. The company eventually entered receivership in 1990 with Acorn reporting a \u00a3242,000 loss associated with the investment. Such were the ambitions of Acorn's management that a joint venture company was established in Hong Kong under the name \"Optical Information Systems\", apparently engaging in the development of \"digital, optical technology for computer data storage\". Involving a Hong Kong turntable manufacturer, Better Sound Reproduction Ltd., Acorn were to set up a research and development facility in Palo Alto, California, US to bring \"compact laser disk drives designed as floppy disk drive replacements\" to market within 18 months.\nIn February 1985, speculation about the state of Acorn's finances intensified with the appointment of a temporary chief executive, Alexander Reid, to run the company, together with the announcement that Acorn had replaced its financial advisors, Lazards, and that the company's stockbrokers, Cazenove, had resigned, ultimately leading to the suspension of Acorn shares, these having fallen to a low of 23 pence per share. With these events reportedly being the result of disagreement between Acorn and Lazards over the measures needed to rescue the company, with Lazards favouring a sale or refinancing whereby the founders would lose control, Acorn and their replacement advisors, Close Brothers, were reported to be pursuing a \"radical reorganisation of the company\". Lazards had sought to attract financing from GEC but had failed to do so. Close Brothers also found themselves in the position of seeking a financing partner for Acorn, but in a significantly more urgent timeframe, making \"financial institutions or a large computer company\" the most likely candidates, these having the necessary resources and decision-making agility for a timely intervention.\n1985\u20131998: Olivetti subsidiary.\nThe dire financial situation was brought to a head in February 1985, when one of Acorn's creditors issued a winding-up petition. It would eventually emerge that Acorn owed \u00a331.1 million to various creditors including manufacturers AB Electronics and Wong's Electronics. Wong's had been awarded a $45 million contract to produce the BBC Micro for the US market. During the search for potential financing partners, an Olivetti director had approached Close Brothers, ostensibly as part of Olivetti's strategy of acquiring technologically advanced small companies. After a short period of negotiations, Curry and Hauser signed an agreement with Olivetti on 20 February. With the founders relinquishing control of the company and seeing their combined stake fall from 85.7% to 36.5%, the Italian computer company took a 49.3% stake in Acorn for \u00a310.39 million, which went some way to covering Acorn's \u00a310.9 million losses in the previous six months, effectively valuing Acorn at around a tenth of its valuation of \u00a3216 million the year before. Acorn's share price collapse and the suspension of its listing was attributed by some news outlets to the company's failure to establish itself in the US market, with one source citing costs of $5.5 million related to that endeavour.\nIn July 1985, Olivetti acquired an additional \u00a34 million of Acorn shares, raising its ownership stake in the company to 79.8%. Major creditors agreed to write off \u00a37.9 million in debts, and the BBC agreed to waive 50% of outstanding royalty payments worth a reported \u00a32 million. This second refinancing left the Acorn founders with less than 15% ownership of the company. Meanwhile, the financial difficulties had reduced the number of employees at Acorn from a peak of 480 to around 270.\nWith Brian Long appointed as managing director, Acorn were set to move forward with a new OEM-focused computer named the Communicator and the Cambridge Workstation, whose launch had been delayed until the end of July 1985 due to the suspension of Acorn's shares. Of subsequent significance, Hermann Hauser was also expected to announce a \"VLSI chip design using a reduced instruction set\". Unveiled towards the end of 1985, the Communicator was Acorn's answer to ICL's One Per Desk initiative. This Acorn machine was based around a 16-bit 65SC816 CPU, 128\u00a0KB RAM, expandable to 512\u00a0KB, plus additional battery-backed RAM. It had a new multi-tasking OS, four internal ROM sockets, and shipped with a software suite based on View and ViewSheet. It also had an attached telephone, communications software and auto-answer/auto-dial modem. However, with Acorn's finances having sustained the development cost of the Archimedes, and with the custom systems division having contributed substantially to the company's losses in 1987, a change in strategy took effect towards the end of 1987, moving away from \"individual customers\" and towards \"volume products\", resulting in 47 of Acorn's 300 staff being made redundant, the closure of the custom systems division, and the abandonment of the Communicator.\nIn February 1986, Acorn announced that it was ceasing US sales operations, and sold its remaining US BBC Microcomputers for $1.25 million to a Texas company, Basic, which was a subsidiary of Datum, the Mexican manufacturer of the Spanish version of the BBC Microcomputer (with modified Spanish keyboards for the South American market). The sales office in Woburn, Massachusetts was closed at this time. Acorn was reported as having achieved \"negligible U.S. sales\". In 1990, in contrast, Acorn set up a sales and marketing operation in Australia and New Zealand by seeking to acquire long-time distributor Barson Computers Australasia, with Acorn managing director Sam Wauchope noting Acorn's presence in Australia since 1983 and being \"the only computer manufacturer whose products are recommended by all Australian state education authorities\".\nAcorn also sought once again to expand into Germany in the 1990s, identifying the market as the largest in Europe whose technically sophisticated computer retailers were looking for opportunities to sell higher-margin products than IBM PC compatibles, with a large enthusiast community amongst existing and potential customers. Efforts were made to establish a local marketing presence and to offer localised versions of Acorn's products. Despite optimistic projections of success, and with Acorn having initially invested \u00a3700,000 in the endeavour, the loss-making operation was closed in 1995 as part of broader cost-cutting and restructuring in response to a decline in revenue and difficulties experienced by various Acorn divisions.\nOstensibly facilitated or catalysed by Olivetti's acquisition of Acorn, reports in late 1985 indicated plans for possible collaboration between Acorn, Olivetti and Thomson in the European education sector to define a standard for an educational microcomputer system analogous to the MSX computing architecture and to the established IBM PC compatible architecture. Deliberations continued into 1986, with Acorn proposing its own ARM processor architecture as the basis for the initiative, whereas Thomson had proposed the Motorola 68000. Expectations that Olivetti would actively market Acorn's machines in Europe were, however, frustrated by Olivetti's own assessment of Acorn's products as \"too expensive\" and the proprietary operating system offering \"limited flexibility\". Instead, Olivetti sought to promote its M19 personal computer for the European schools market, offering it to Acorn for sale in the UK (ultimately, as the rebadged Acorn M19). Olivetti would eventually offer both Acorn's Master Compact and the Thomson MO6 to the Italian market with its Prodest branding.\nCollaboration involving Acorn, Olivetti and Thomson (subsequently as SGS-Thomson) continued in the context of research projects, with a consortium of vendors including AEG, Bull, Philips and ICL participating in the Multiworks initiative to develop Unix workstations as part of the European ESPRIT framework. Acorn's particular role in Multiworks concerned a low-cost workstation featuring the ARM chipset, alongside a \"high-cost authoring workstation\" based on Olivetti's CP486 workstation. The Chorus system was to be used as the basis of the Unix operating system provided.\nOlivetti would eventually relinquish majority control of Acorn in early 1996, selling shares to US and UK investment groups to leave the company with a shareholding in Acorn of around 45%. In July 1996, Olivetti announced that it had sold 14.7% of the group to Lehman Brothers, reducing its stake at that time to 31.2%. Lehman said it planned to resell the shares to investors.\nBBC Master and Archimedes.\nThe BBC Master was launched in February 1986 and met with considerable success. From 1986 to 1989, about 200,000 systems were sold, each costing \u00a3499, mainly to UK schools and universities. A number of enhanced versions were launched, for example, the Master 512, which had 512\u00a0KB of RAM and an internal 80186 processor for MS-DOS compatibility, and the Master Turbo, which had a 65C102 second processor.\nThe first commercial use of the ARM architecture was in the ARM Development System, a Tube-linked second processor for the BBC Master which allowed one to write programs for the new system. It sold for \u00a34,500 and included the ARM processor, 4\u00a0MB of RAM and a set of development tools with an enhanced version of BBC BASIC. This system did not include the three support chips (VIDC, MEMC, and IOC) which were later to form part of the Archimedes system. They made their first appearance in the A500 second processor, which was used internally within Acorn as a development platform, and had a similar form-factor to the ARM development system.\nThe second ARM-based product was the Acorn Archimedes desktop-computer, released in mid-1987, some 18 months after IBM launched their RISC-based RT PC. The first RISC-based home computer, using the ARM (Acorn RISC Machine) chip, the Archimedes was popular in the United Kingdom, Australasia and Ireland, and was considerably more powerful and advanced than most offerings of the day. The Archimedes was advertised in both printed and broadcast media. One example of such advertising is a mock-up of the RISC OS 2 desktop, showing some software application directories, with the advert text added within windows. However, the vast majority of home users opted for an Atari ST or Amiga when looking to upgrade their 8-bit micros. As with the BBC, the Archimedes instead flourished in schools and other educational settings but just a few years later in the early 1990s this market began stratifying into the PC-dominated world. Acorn continued to produce updated models of the Archimedes, including a laptop (the A4), and in 1994 launched the Risc PC, whose top specification would later include a 233\u00a0MHz StrongARM processor. These were sold mainly into education, specialist and enthusiast markets, such as professional composers using Sibelius 7.\nARM Ltd..\nAcorn's silicon partner, VLSI, had been given the task of finding new applications for the ARM CPU and support chips. Hauser's Active Book company had been developing a handheld device and for this the ARM CPU developers had created a static version of their processor, the ARM2aS.\nMembers of Apple's Advanced Technology Group (ATG) had made initial contact with Acorn over use of the ARM in an experimental Apple II (2) style prototype called M\u00f6bius. Experiments done in the M\u00f6bius project proved that the ARM RISC architecture could be highly attractive for certain types of future products. The M\u00f6bius project was briefly considered as the basis for a new line of Apple computers but it was stopped for fear it would compete with the Macintosh and confuse the market. However, the M\u00f6bius project evolved awareness of the ARM processor within Apple. The M\u00f6bius Team made minor changes to the ARM registers, and used their working prototype to demonstrate a variety of impressive performance benchmarks.\nLater Apple was developing an entirely new computing platform for its Newton. Various requirements had been set for the processor in terms of power consumption, cost and performance, and there was also a need for fully static operation in which the clock could be stopped at any time. Only the Acorn RISC Machine came close to meeting all these demands, but there were still deficiencies. The ARM did not, for example, have an integral memory management unit, as this function was being provided by the MEMC support chip and Acorn did not have the resources to develop one.\nApple and Acorn began to collaborate on developing the ARM, and it was decided that this would be best achieved by a separate company. The bulk of the Advanced Research and Development section of Acorn that had developed the ARM CPU formed the basis of ARM Holdings when that company was spun off in November 1990. Acorn Group and Apple Computer Inc. each had a 43% shareholding in ARM (in 1996), while VLSI was an investor and first ARM licensee.\nAcorn Pocket Book.\nIn 1993, Acorn decided to offer an Acorn branded Psion Series 3 PDA, badged as an Acorn Pocket Book, with a later variant branded the Acorn Pocket Book II. Essentially a rebadged OEM version of the Series 3 with slightly different on-board software, the device was marketed as an inexpensive computer for schoolchildren, rather than as an executive tool. The hardware was the same as the Series 3, but the integrated applications were different. For instance, the Pocket Book omitted the Agenda diary and Spell dictionary applications, which became an optional application, supplied on ROM SSD which could be inserted into either of the ROM bays underneath the device. Other programs were renamed: \"System\" became \"Desktop\", \"Word\" became \"Write\", \"Sheet\" became \"Abacus\" and \"Data\" became \"Cards\".\nSet-top boxes.\nIn 1994, Acorn established a new division, \"Online Media\", focusing on interactive multimedia client hardware. Online Media aimed to exploit the projected video-on-demand (VOD) boom, an interactive television system which would allow users to select and watch video content over a network. In September 1994 the Cambridge Digital Interactive Television Trial of video-on-demand services was set up by Online Media, Anglia Television, Cambridge Cable (now part of Virgin Media) and Advanced Telecommunication Modules Ltd (ATML). The trial involved creating a wide area ATM network linking TV-company to subscribers' homes and delivering services such as home shopping, online education, software downloaded on-demand and the World Wide Web. The wide area network used a combination of fibre and coaxial cable, and the switches were housed in the roadside cabinets of Cambridge Cable's existing network.\nOlivetti Research Laboratory developed the technology used by the trial. An ICL video server provided the service via ATM switches manufactured by ATML, another company set up by Hauser and Hopper. The trial commenced at a speed of 2\u00a0Mbit/s to the home, subsequently increased to 25\u00a0Mbit/s.\nSubscribers used Acorn Online Media Set Top Boxes. For the first six months the trial involved 10 VOD terminals; the second phase was expanded to cover 100 homes and eight schools with a further 150 terminals in test labs. A number of other organisations gradually joined in, including the National Westminster Bank (NatWest), the BBC, the Post Office, Tesco, and the local education authority. Having initially deployed set-top boxes based on Risc PC hardware, a second generation of the hardware, STB2, featured the ARM7500 system-on-a-chip, this having been manufactured for Online Media by VLSI, and integrated MPEG video decoding hardware. (The C-Cube Microsystems CL450 part is evident on the STB20 circuit board, this product being an MPEG-1 decoder introduced in May 1992.) Plans were announced to expand the initiative from 250 homes to 1000, to support NatWest's cable television banking and shopping services, with video on demand provision being strengthened through the deployment of a digital video server from ICL having \"a maximum capacity of several hundred gigabytes of fast hard disc storage\", connected via a 155\u00a0Mbit/s link and supplementing Olivetti Research Disc Bricks already acting as smaller capacity video servers. Industry support for the Online Media platform was also announced by Oracle and Macromedia.\nBBC Education tested delivery of radio-on-demand programmes to primary schools, and a new educational service, Education Online, was established to deliver material such as Open University television programmes and educational software. Netherhall School was provided with an inexpensive video server and operated as a provider of trial services, with Anglia Polytechnic University taking up a similar role some time later.\nIt was hoped that Online Media could be floated as a separate company, and a share issue raising \u00a317.2 million of additional capital was announced in 1995, this to finance the division and \"underpin Acorn Group finances\" against a backdrop of deteriorating financial results partly caused by an increasingly uncompetitive lower-end product range. Having entered into a deal with Lightspan Partnership Inc. to supply set-top boxes for the US education market, the order was cancelled and put pressure on Acorn's already straitened financial situation. Various other factors ensured that the predicted video-on-demand boom never really materialised as anticipated.\nAcorn subsequently planned to incorporate set-top box technology into its product range, launching an initiative entitled \"No Limits to Learning\" and previewing a range of products under the MediaRange brand, with the MediaSurfer being \"essentially an Online Media STB with a World Wide Web browser built in\", and with other products in the range being based on \"focused applications\" of established Acorn products. Evolution of the technology continued with the launch of the STB22 model, described as \"a cross between an NC (Network Computer) and a STB\". This model combined set-top box features such as ATM25 networking for interactive video with more general Internet features such as Web browsing and Java application support. Described as \"the icing on the cake\", MPEG2 video decoding hardware was provided by a chipset from LSI. Although Acorn were reportedly hoping for the interactive television market to \"eventually take off\" and initiate \"mass deployment\" by traditional telecoms operators, corporate intranet applications were also seen as a target market. With more conservative deployments in mind, the ATM25 interface in the product could be replaced by an Ethernet interface.\nNewsPad.\nIn 1994, the EU initiated the NewsPad programme, with the aim of developing a common mechanism to author and deliver news electronically to consumer devices. The programme's name and format were inspired by the devices described and depicted in Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film \"\". Acorn won a contract to develop a consumer device / receiver, and duly supplied a RISC OS-based touch-screen tablet computer for the pilot. The device measured and was being tried in 1996 in Spain by Ediciones Primera Plana. The Barcelona-based pilot ended in 1997, but the tablet format and ARM architecture may have influenced Intel's 1999 WebPad / Web Tablet program.\nSchoolServer.\nAlthough Acorn had largely focused on its ARM-based product range offering RISC OS (and, for a time, RISC iX), albeit with an increasing emphasis on DOS and Windows compatibility through its PC card products, the emergence of larger networks in education connecting systems based on different computing platforms\u2014typically Acorn, PC and Apple Macintosh\u2014motivated the introduction of the SchoolServer product range in 1995. The range consisted of server systems manufactured by IBM running Windows NT Server (specifically Windows NT 3.5), employing a single 100\u00a0MHz PowerPC processor, with 24\u00a0MB or 32\u00a0MB of RAM, one or two 1\u00a0GB hard drives, and built-in Ethernet interfaces.\nAcorn bundled ANT Limited's OmniClient software to provide the connectivity support required for Acorn's own computers to access the SchoolServer's facilities, these being based on Microsoft's own SchoolServer platform and proprietary networking technologies. The adoption of such hardware and software platforms, motivated by concerns about the capabilities of Acorn's existing products (such as the Risc PC) in the server role, even apparently led to Acorn becoming a Microsoft Solution Provider despite having been \"very vocal critics\" of Microsoft and its technologies in the past.\nOther companies in the educational market introduced similar products to the SchoolServer. For instance, Datathorn Systems introduced a solution called Super Server based on the Motorola PowerStack server system, which was a PowerPC-based machine capable of running Windows NT 3.51 or AIX 4.1, with the Super Server project reportedly being \"the product of research at both Oxford and Cambridge universities\". Having approval from Acorn and offering interoperability between Acorn and PC platforms, the solution was deployed at several sites.\nXemplar Education.\nIn 1996, Acorn entered into a joint venture with Apple Computer UK called Xemplar to provide computers and services to the UK education market. Described as \"the unthinkable\" and a \"marriage of convenience\", the alliance sought to reverse the declining fortunes of both Acorn and Apple in the sector, also prompting speculation that Apple's own strategy based on adoption of the PowerPC platform might lead Acorn along the same path, with Acorn already having expressed some interest in PowerPC and having introduced a PowerPC-based product in the form of its SchoolServer offering. The deal was regarded as benefiting Apple more strongly, with Acorn developers being encouraged to port their software to Mac OS, and with RISC OS effectively being sidelined to Acorn's set-top box and network computing products.\nXemplar initially resisted the demand for PC-compatible products in classrooms, limiting its PC offerings to school administration. A survey in 1998 found that Apple and Acorn systems at that time accounted for 47% and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 of computers in UK primary and secondary schools respectively. However, in 1999, with Acorn undergoing restructuring, the company's remaining stake in Xemplar was sold to Apple for \u00a33 million. By this time, Xemplar had become \"a significant supplier of Wintel PCs\" out of commercial necessity, with Acorn's Network Computer being the only product from its former co-owner still actively marketed by Xemplar. Despite Acorn's own upheavals, Xemplar remained committed to selling Acorn products in its portfolio. Renamed to Apple Xemplar Education, the operation was wound up in 2014. Acorn Education and later Xemplar Education were heavily involved in Tesco's \"Computers for Schools\" programme in the UK, providing hardware and software in exchange for vouchers collected from Tesco purchases.\nThe Welsh Office Multimedia/Portables Initiative (WOMPI), launched in 1996 to provide primary schools with computer equipment, prescribed that Welsh schools choosing the multimedia option received multimedia PCs exclusively supplied by RM. This upset other suppliers such as Xemplar and members of the National Association of Advisers for Computers in Education (NAACE), with complaints including those about the imposition of an incompatible computing platform on small schools who were already committed to the RISC OS platform, these schools being potentially incapable of managing \"a mix of machines\", and the lack of appropriate Welsh language software for the Windows platform, this being of particular concern in schools where lessons were \"conducted exclusively in Welsh\" and where an \"excellent working relationship with British software houses\" had cultivated the availability of major RISC OS applications in Welsh. The range of multimedia software offered in the initiative was also criticised: \"none of the scheme's CD-Roms\" were in Welsh, and Acorn machines also needed additional software, at an estimated \u00a3300 in extra costs, to \"make effective use\" of the software titles.\nNetwork computers.\nWhen BBC2's \"The Money Programme\" screened an interview with Larry Ellison in October 1995, Acorn Online Media Managing Director Malcolm Bird realised that Ellison's network computer was, basically, an Acorn set-top box. After initial discussions between Oracle Corporation and Olivetti, Hauser and Acorn a few weeks later, Bird was dispatched to San Francisco with Acorn's latest Set Top Box. Oracle had already talked seriously with computer manufacturers including Sun and Apple about the contract for putting together the NC blueprint machine; there were also rumours in the industry that said Oracle itself was working on the reference design. After Bird's visit to Oracle, Ellison visited Acorn and a deal was reached: Acorn would define the NC Reference Standard.\nEllison was expecting to announce the NC in February 1996. Sophie Wilson was put in charge of the NC project, and by mid-November a draft NC specification was ready. By January 1996 the formal details of the contract between Acorn and Oracle had been worked out, and the PCB was designed and ready to be put into production. In February 1996, Acorn Network Computing was founded. In August 1996 it launched the Acorn Network Computer.\nIt was hoped that the Network Computer would create a significant new sector in which Acorn Network Computing would be a major player, either selling its own products or earning money from licence fees paid by other manufacturers for the right to produce their own NCs. To that end, two of Acorn's major projects were the creation of a new 'consumer device' operating system named Galileo, and, in conjunction with Digital Semiconductor and ARM, a new StrongARM chipset consisting of the SA-1500 and SA-1501. Galileo's main feature was a guarantee of a certain quality of service to each process in which the resources (CPU, memory, etc.) required to ensure reliable operation would be kept available regardless of the behaviour of other processes. The SA-1500 sported higher clock rates than existing StrongARM CPUs and, more importantly, a media-focussed coprocessor (the Attached Media Processor or AMP). The SA-1500 was to be the first release target for Galileo.\nAfter having incorporated its STB and NC business areas as separate companies, Acorn created a new wholly owned subsidiary, Acorn RISC Technologies (ART). ART focused on the development of other software and hardware technologies built on top of ARM processors.\n1998\u20131999: Element 14 and MSDW acquisition.\nDuring the first half of 1998 Acorn's management were heavily involved in the initial public offering of ARM Holdings plc which raised \u00a318 million for Acorn throughout 1998. In June 1998, Stan Boland took over as CEO of Acorn Computers from David Lee, initiating a review of Acorn's core business.\nThe company had losses of \u00a39 million in the first nine months of the year and in September 1998 the results of the review led to a significant restructuring of the company. The Workstation division was to close, a 40% reduction in staff, and the Risc PC 2 code-named Phoebe that was nearing completion was cancelled. These actions allowed the company to reduce ongoing losses and focus on other activities. Acorn concentrated on development of digital TV set-top boxes and high performance media centric DSP (silicon and software). It also produced a reference design for a Windows NT thin client using a Cirrus Logic system on a chip.\nRefocusing and discontinuation of activities.\nTo concentrate on these two activities Acorn hired a group of former STMicroelectronics silicon-design engineers and they formed the basis of a \u00a32 million silicon-design centre that Acorn set up in Bristol. They also started to dispose of some of their interests in the former workstation market and in January 1999 sold their 50% interest in Xemplar Education to Apple Computer.\nAttempts were made to secure the rights to Acorn's desktop products including network computers and \"various associated technologies\", RISC OS, and the abandoned Phoebe workstation project by a consortium of Acorn market interests, and a memorandum of understanding was reportedly signed by both Stan Boland, representing Acorn, and former Acorn executive Peter Bondar, representing the consortium. However, Acorn pulled out of this tentative deal amidst accusations of attempts to sideline the consortium and to negotiate directly with its financial backers. It was reported that Stephen Streater of Eidos may have made a \u00a30.5 million bid for the rights to the PC range, but in October 1998 the distribution rights to the existing designs of machines were granted to Castle Technology to supply Acorn's dealer network. In March 1999, RISCOS Ltd acquired a licence to develop and release RISC OS.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n[T]he future of this company lies as a leading player in the digital TV system components\u00a0...\nChief Executive, Stan Boland, in September 1998\nBy January 1999, Acorn Computers Limited had renamed to Element 14 Limited (though still owned by Acorn Group plc), referring to the element silicon with atomic number 14; this change was to reflect the changed nature of the business and to distance itself from the education market that Acorn Computers was most known for. Other names had been considered by the company, but the domain name \"e-14.com\" had been registered before the official announcement.\nAcquisition and asset disposal.\nUltimately, the widely anticipated issues around releasing Acorn's 24% shareholding in ARM, with a need for \"minimising the massive tax burden posed by disposing the holding\", were resolved through \"creative accounting courtesy of Morgan Stanley\", with an offshore subsidiary of the bank acquiring Acorn, releasing the \u00a3300 million shareholding \"using the purchase as a tax loss and swapping Acorn investors' shares for ARM shares\", and with the bank retaining an estimated \u00a340 million shareholding in ARM as a consequence. As part of the process leading to the acquisition of Acorn by the Morgan Stanley subsidiary, MSDW Investment Holdings Limited, with the intention to \"minimise the liabilities\" of the group through the disposal of assets, Pace Micro Technology agreed to acquire Acorn's set-top box division for approximately \u00a3200,000, also obtaining Acorn's rights and obligations with regard to RISC OS.\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of Acorn, an offer was extended to a company \"owned by Stan Boland and certain senior management to purchase\u00a0... the silicon and software design activity\" for approximately \u00a31\u00a0million. This distinct company, known as \"New Jam Inc\" or \"NewJam Inc\", already founded in April 1999, eventually acquired these assets for \u00a3620,539, and effectively became the independent Element 14 venture, acquiring the name from the former Acorn Computers Limited in October 1999. Acorn Computers then became known as Cabot 2 Limited. A subsequent report put the sale price of this division of Acorn at \u00a31.5\u00a0million, offering the prescient observation that this new business would itself be acquired for \"several million pounds\" by an established company in the industry. This anticipated acquisition, involving Broadcom, occurred the following year.\n1999\u20132015: Legacy operations.\nAcorn Computers, in its new guise of Cabot 2, would continue to administer the remaining assets of the business and to \"tidy up remaining contractual and logistical obligations\", these including the servicing of product warranties. In late 1999, Reflex Electronics signed a five-year contract to perform warranty work and technical support for Acorn-manufactured products, renewing an earlier arrangement with Acorn. Acorn Group \u2013 the parent company of Acorn Computers Limited \u2013 had itself been renamed from Acorn Computer Group in 1997, and the company was subsequently renamed Cabot 1 Limited and taken private by MSDW in February 2000. The company remained (at least legally) active until being dissolved in December 2015.\nLegacy.\nThe legacy of the company's work is evidenced in spin-off technologies, with the company being described in 2013 as \"the most influential business in the innovation cluster's history\". In 2010, the company was listed by David Meyer in \"ZDNet\" as number nine in a feature of top ten \"Dead IT giants\". Many British IT professionals gained their early experiences on Acorns, which were often more technically advanced than commercially successful US hardware.\nRevival of the Acorn trademark.\nIn early 2006, the dormant Acorn trademark was licensed from the French company Aristide &amp; Co Antiquaire de Marques, by a new company based in Nottingham. This company was dissolved in late 2009.\nOn 23 February 2018 the Acorn trademark made another return when a new company Acorn Inc. Ltd announced a brand new smartphone, the Acorn Micro C5. The Acorn Micro C5 has since been discontinued.\nIn popular culture.\nIn 2009, BBC4 screened \"Micro Men\", a drama based on the rivalry between Acorn Computers and Sinclair's competing machines.\nTV series.\nAcorn products featured prominently in a number of Educational television series, including:\nMagazines.\nAcorn products spawned a series of dedicated publications, including:\nThey also featured in dedicated sections of:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "56285", "revid": "41294494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56285", "title": "Disability", "text": "Impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions\nDisability is the experience of any condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or have equitable access within a given society. Disabilities may be cognitive, developmental, intellectual, mental, physical, sensory, or a combination of multiple factors. Disabilities can be present from birth or can be acquired during a person's lifetime. Historically, disabilities have only been recognized based on a narrow set of criteria\u2014however, disabilities are not binary and can be present in unique characteristics depending on the individual. A disability may be readily visible, or invisible in nature.\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities defines disability as including:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder [a person's] full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.Disabilities have been perceived differently throughout history, through a variety of different theoretical lenses. There are two main models that attempt to explain disability in our society: the medical model and the social model. The medical model serves as a theoretical framework that considers disability as an undesirable medical condition that requires specialized treatment. Those who ascribe to the medical model tend to focus on finding the root causes of disabilities, as well as any cures\u2014such as assistive technology. The social model centers disability as a societally-created limitation on individuals who do not have the same ability as the majority of the population. Those who ascribe to the social model tend to focus on accessibility and social/cultural attitudes toward disability. Although the medical model and social model are the most common frames for disability, there are a multitude of other models that theorize disability.\nThere are many terms that explain aspects of disability. While some terms solely exist to describe phenomena pertaining to disability, others have been centered around stigmatizing and ostracizing those with disabilities. Some terms have such a negative connotation that they are considered to be slurs. A current point of contention is whether it is appropriate to use person-first language (i.e. a person who is disabled) or identity-first language (i.e. a disabled person) when referring to disability and an individual.\nDue to the marginalization of disabled people, there have been several activist causes that push for equitable treatment and access in society. Disability activists have fought to receive equal and equitable rights under the law\u2014though there are still political issues that enable or advance the oppression of disabled people. Although disability activism serves to dismantle ableist systems, social norms relating to the perception of disabilities are often reinforced by tropes used by the media. Since negative perceptions of disability are pervasive in modern society, disabled people have turned to self-advocacy in an attempt to push back against their marginalization. The recognition of disability as an identity that is experienced differently based on the other multi-faceted identities of the individual is one often pointed out by disabled self-advocates. The ostracization of disability from mainstream society has created the opportunity for a disability culture to emerge. While disabled activists still promote the integration of disabled people into mainstream society, several disabled-only spaces have been created to foster a disability community\u2014such as with art, social media, and sports.\nHistory.\nContemporary understandings of disability derive from concepts that arose during the scientific Enlightenment in the west; prior to the Enlightenment, physical differences were viewed through a different lens.\nAntiquity.\nHistorically, scholars have often assumed that disabled individuals were unsupported and marginalized within their communities, based on the belief that ancient agricultural societies had to be strategic with their limited resources for survival. For instance, some historians argue that ancient Greeks actively practiced ableism through infanticide, as suggested in the writings of Plutarch, Plato, and Aristotle.\nIn \"The Life of Lycurgus\" of Plutarch\u2019s \"Parallel Lives\", he describes infanticide as a common practice in Sparta, where the lawgiver decreed that newborn infants be taken to the \"lesche\", likely a public building, for examination by elders. If an infant was \u2018ill-bred and deformed,\u2019 it would be sent to the \"apothetai\", meaning \u2018exposure places,\u2019 a pit beneath Mount Taygetus. Plutarch suggested this practice occurred because a deformed infant would be seen as a liability to Sparta, a city-state known for its strict martial ethos. While Plutarch\u2019s account provides valuable insights into Spartan society, its reliability is questionable, as he lived 700 years after the events he described. Even Plutarch acknowledged that his accounts were open to dispute for this very reason.\nSimilarly, in \"The Republic\", Plato argues that, in an ideal state, rulers must ensure the breeding of the best men and women while discouraging those deemed inferior from reproducing. He asserts that if the children of inferior parents, or any other parents, were deformed, they should be \u2018hidden away in a secret and unknown place, as is fitting.\u2019 In \"Politics\", Aristotle advocates that \u2018the bodies of offspring should conform to the wishes of the lawgiver,\u2019 ideally being healthy and strong, which implies a similarly ableist stance to that of Plato. He further proposes that a law should exist to prevent the raising of deformed infants, implying his endorsement of killing disabled infants.\nHowever, these claims represent the philosophical ideals of Greek thinkers and do not necessarily reflect the actual practices of ancient Greece, as neither work was intended to serve as factual records. In fact, there is considerable evidence suggesting that individuals with deformities were well cared for in antiquity.\nAt the Windover Archeological Site, one of the skeletons was a male about 15 years old who had spina bifida. The condition meant that the boy, probably paralyzed below the waist, was taken care of in a hunter-gatherer community.\nDisability was not viewed as a means of divine punishment and therefore disabled individuals were neither exterminated nor discriminated against for their impairments. Many were instead employed in different levels of Mesopotamian society including working in religious temples as servants of the gods.\nIn Ancient Egypt, staffs were frequently used in society. A common usage for them was for older persons with disabilities to help them walk.\nIn Ancient Greece, regardless of gender, age, or rank, deformed citizens were largely acknowledged, embraced, and accommodated in various aspects of society. This is illustrated in the \"Hippocratic Corpus\", a collection of treatises written by physicians during the late 5th and 4th centuries B.C.E. as a practical manual. Therefore, it offers a more accurate depiction of how the Greeks treated disabled people. For instance, many of the treatises describe the conditions and treatments for infants with congenital anomalies or impairments, such as weasel-arm, clubfoot, and cleft conditions. Ironically, among these, the practice of infanticide or the harming of deformed infants is never mentioned.\nIn fact, these Hippocratic physicians treated a wide range of patients throughout the Greek-speaking world from the 5th century BCE onwards. Many of them expressed neutrality, if not optimism, toward deformed infants, striving to cure them while documenting their conditions. This suggests that it may not have been normal in ancient Greece to kill deformed infants, presenting a reality that contrasts with the views of Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient philosophers.\nAdditionally, the depiction of disabled adults or gods was common in the literature of ancient Greece. In Homer\u2019s \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\", Hephaistos, a god and renowned craftsman, is described as being \u2018lame in both legs,\u2019 and he is mentioned 41 times in the \"Iliad\" and 19 times in the \"Odyssey.\" In Book 2 of the Iliad, Homer provides a detailed description of Thersites\u2019 deformity, including his bandy legs, lame foot, hunched shoulders, and balding pate, calling him \u2018the ugliest man who came beneath Ilion.\u2019 This suggests that ancient Greeks acknowledged disabled adult civilians, as disability, whether congenital or acquired, was common due to the harsh realities of ancient life and warfare.\nIn addition to literary evidence, archaeological evidence is crucial in unfolding ancient Greeks\u2019 attitude towards deformed individuals. One that is most related to the discussion of infanticide in Ancient Greece is the Agora Bone Well, in which archaeologists found a large number of skeletons, including those of infants. Since the median age at death for these infants was only eight days old, it gives rise to the assumption that infanticide could be a possible explanation. However, scholars cannot determine whether the infants were intentionally killed or whether they died of natural causes, which was particularly common, especially during the first eight days after birth. \nMoreover, archaeologists have discovered a significant number of feeding bottles throughout the Hellenic world, dating back to the Late Bronze Age. Many of these were found in the tombs of infants and young children. While scholars debate whether these bottles were used as aids for weaning infants or as symbols of condolence with no practical purpose, the shape of the bottles is particularly suited for feeding infants with cleft conditions. Depending on the severity, such infants would have had difficulty extracting milk from a nipple. This suggests that the ancient Greeks may have invested extra care and resources in raising disabled infants, rather killing them.\nContrary to previous beliefs, Greek men with disabilities or physical infirmities were generally exempt from military campaigns and battles. In \"Memorabilia\", Xenophon suggests that men with bodily weakness or illness were considered liabilities in battle. Additionally, during the Battle of Thermopylae, the Spartan king and commander Leonidas excused Eurytus and Aristodemus from fighting, as both of them were suffering from severe eye sickness, demonstrating that men unfit for war were not forced to participate. However, in exceptional cases, disabled or injured men might be called upon to take on suitable roles that would contribute to the war effort.\nIn terms of personal life, there is no evidence to suggest that disabled Greeks were barred from marriage or reproduction. This likely stemmed from the belief that deformed parents did not necessarily produce deformed offspring. However, disabled individuals may have faced greater challenges in finding a suitable partner, as they were sometimes rejected by the family of a potential spouse. \nRegarding their economic situation, disabled Greeks\u2014regardless of gender or social rank\u2014worked in a variety of positions and professions. According to Lysias, a disabled man who uses two canes to walk \u2018plies a craft\u2019 and runs a shop, demonstrating that disabled individuals were not deprived of the ability to support themselves. In \"On Joints,\" Hippocrates describes people with arm disabilities also being engaged in \u2018handiwork,\u2019 provided they were still able to operate tools. Plato also mentions, in \"Laws\", that slaves who acquired disabilities later in life could be reassigned to other suitable roles, a principle that, logically, should also apply to free individuals in Greece.\nAncient Greeks were also subjected to a wide range of physical consequences of aging, causing impairments and disabilities. Therefore, ancient Greeks put great effort into assisting elderly people in their communities. In some Greek states, children were legally required to care for their elderly parents, which might have included parents who were physically or mentally impaired. According to Aristotle, people who failed to do so would be imprisoned. Provisions that enabled individuals with impaired mobility to access temples and healing sanctuaries were made in ancient Greece. Specifically, by 370 B.C., at the most important healing sanctuary in the wider area, the Sanctuary of Asclepius at Epidaurus, there were at least 11 permanent stone ramps that provided access to mobility-impaired visitors to nine different structures. On top of this, disabled Athenians who were unable to support themselves received monetary assistance from the state, sufficient to cover their basic needs. This indicates that some forms of charity and social welfare existed in Athens.\nDisability was also common among individuals of high status in ancient Greece. In the 6th century BCE, Croesus, the King of Lydia, had two sons, one of whom was either deaf or mute. He spent a considerable amount of wealth in an unsuccessful attempt to cure this son, even consulting the oracle of Apollo at Delphi. Eventually, Croesus rejected the disabled son, choosing to favor only his able-bodied son, Atys, instead. Similarly, Agesilaus, a Spartan king in the 4th century BCE, was lame in one leg but still became a general and fought in major battles. The Macedonian king, Philip II, also suffered from multiple physical impairments during his conquests; he lost one eye, fractured his collarbone, and shattered one hand and leg.\nIn conclusion, ancient Greeks demonstrated notable empathy and acceptance toward their disabled peers, contrary to the views presented in the writings of Plato and Aristotle. Literary accounts from Hippocratic physicians and archaeological evidence support the idea that the Greeks made efforts to cure and assist disabled individuals, including deformed infants, whom Plutarch claimed were promptly killed in Sparta. Since disability was not uncommon, it was frequently mentioned in literature and poetry. Disabled individuals, regardless of social rank, were largely integrated into society, thanks to the variety of roles and duties available in personal life, the economy, and the military.\nMiddle Ages and After.\nDuring the Middle Ages, madness and other conditions were thought to be caused by demons. They were also thought to be part of the natural order, especially during and in the fallout of the Black Death, which wrought impairments throughout the general population. In the early modern period there was a shift to seeking biological causes for physical and mental differences, as well as heightened interest in demarcating categories: for example, Ambroise Pare, in the sixteenth century, wrote of \"monsters\", \"prodigies\", and \"the maimed\". The European Enlightenment's emphases on knowledge derived from reason and on the value of natural science to human progress helped spawn the birth of institutions and associated knowledge systems that observed and categorized human beings; among these, the ones significant to the development of today's concepts of disability were asylums, clinics, and prisons.\nContemporary concepts of disability are rooted in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century developments. Foremost among these was the development of clinical medical discourse, which made the human body visible as a thing to be manipulated, studied, and transformed. These worked in tandem with scientific discourses that sought to classify and categorize and, in so doing, became methods of normalization.\nThe concept of the \"norm\" developed in this time period, and is signaled in the work of the Belgian statistician, sociologist, mathematician, and astronomer Adolphe Quetelet, who wrote in the 1830s of \u2013 the average man. Quetelet postulated that one could take the sum of all people's attributes in a given population (such as their height or weight) and find their average and that this figure should serve as a statistical norm toward which all should aspire.\nThis idea of the statistical norm threads through the rapid take-up of statistics gathering by Britain, the United States, and the Western European states during this time period, and it is tied to the rise of eugenics. Disability, as well as the concepts of abnormal, non-normal, and normalcy, came from this. The circulation of these concepts is evident in the popularity of the freak show, where showmen profited from exhibiting people who deviated from those norms.\nWith the rise of eugenics in the latter part of the nineteenth century, such deviations were viewed as dangerous to the health of entire populations. With disability viewed as part of a person's biological make-up and thus their genetic inheritance, scientists turned their attention to notions of weeding such as \"deviations\" out of the gene pool. Various metrics for assessing a person's genetic fitness were determined and were then used to deport, sterilize, or institutionalize those deemed unfit. People with disabilities were one of the groups targeted by the Nazi regime in Germany, resulting in approximately 250,000 disabled people being killed during the Holocaust. At the end of the Second World War, with the example of Nazi eugenics, eugenics faded from public discourse, and increasingly disability cohered into a set of attributes to which medicine could attend \u2013 whether through augmentation, rehabilitation, or treatment. In both contemporary and modern history, disability was often viewed as a by-product of incest between first-degree relatives or second-degree relatives.\nDisability scholars have also pointed to the Industrial Revolution, along with the economic shift from feudalism to capitalism, as prominent historical moments in the understanding of disability. Although there was a certain amount of religious superstition surrounding disability during the Middle Ages, disabled people were still able to play significant roles in the rural production based economy, allowing them to make genuine contributions to daily economic life. The Industrial Revolution and the advent of capitalism made it so that people were no longer tied to the land and were then forced to find work that would pay a wage in order to survive. The wage system, in combination with industrialized production, transformed the way bodies were viewed as people were increasingly valued for their ability to produce like machines. Capitalism and the industrial revolution effectively solidified this class of \"disabled\" people who could not conform to the standard worker's body or level of work power. As a result, disabled people came to be regarded as a problem, to be solved or erased.\nIn the early 1970s, the disability rights movement became established, when disability activists began to challenge how society treated disabled people and the medical approach to disability. Due to this work, physical barriers to access were identified. These conditions functionally disabled them, and what is now known as the social model of disability emerged. Coined by Mike Oliver in 1983, this phrase distinguishes between the medical model of disability \u2013 under which an impairment needs to be fixed \u2013 and the social model of disability \u2013 under which the society that limits a person needs to be fixed.\nTheory.\nLike many social categories, the concept of \"disability\" is under heavy discussion amongst academia, the medical and legal worlds, and the disability community.\nDisability studies.\nThe academic discipline focused on theorizing disability is disability studies, which has been expanding since the late twentieth century. The field investigates the past, present, and future constructions of disability, along with advancing the viewpoint that disability is a complex social identity from which we can all gain insight. As disabilities scholar Claire Mullaney puts it, \"At its broadest, disability studies encourages scholars to value disability as a form of cultural difference\". Scholars of the field focus on a range of disability-related topics, such as ethics, policy and legislation, history, art of the disability community, and more. Notable scholars from the field include Marta Russell, Robert McRuer, Johanna Hedva, Laura Hershey, Irving Zola, and many more. Prominent disability scholar Lennard J. Davis notes that disability studies should not be considered a niche or specialized discipline, but instead is applicable to a wide range of fields and topics.\nInternational Classification.\nThe International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), produced by the World Health Organization, distinguishes between body functions (physiological or psychological, such as vision) and body structures (anatomical parts, such as the eye and related structures). Impairment in bodily structure or function is defined as involving an anomaly, defect, loss or other significant deviation from certain generally accepted population standards, which may fluctuate over time. Activity is defined as the execution of a task or action. The ICF lists nine broad domains of functioning which can be affected:\nIn concert with disability scholars, the introduction to the ICF states that a variety of conceptual models have been proposed to understand and explain disability and functioning, which it seeks to integrate. These models include the following:\nMedical model.\nThe medical model views disability as a problem of the person, directly caused by disease, trauma, or other health conditions which therefore requires sustained medical care in the form of individual treatment by professionals. In the medical model, management of the disability is aimed at a \"cure\", or the individual's adjustment and behavioral change that would lead to an \"almost-cure\" or effective cure. The individual, in this case, must overcome their disability by medical care. In the medical model, medical care is viewed as the main issue, and at the political level, the principal response is that of modifying or reforming healthcare policy.\nThe medical model focuses on finding causes and cures for disabilities.\nCauses.\nThere are many causes of disability that often affect basic activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, transferring, and maintaining personal hygiene; or advanced activities of daily living such as shopping, food preparation, driving, or working. However, causes of disability are usually determined by a person's capability to perform the activities of daily life. As Marta Russell and Ravi Malhotra argue, \"The 'medicalization' of disablement and the tools of classification clearly played an important role in establishing divisions between the 'disabled' and the 'able-bodied.'\" This positions disability as a problem to be solved via medical intervention, which hinders our understanding about what disability can mean.\n For the purposes of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations provide a list of conditions that should easily be concluded to be disabilities: amputation, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, bipolar disorder, blindness, cancer, cerebral palsy, deafness, diabetes, epilepsy, HIV/AIDS, intellectual disability, major depressive disorder, mobility impairments requiring a wheelchair, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), spina bifida, and schizophrenia.\nThis is not an exhaustive list and many injuries and medical problems cause disability. Some causes of disability, such as injuries, may resolve over time and are considered \"temporary disabilities\". An \"acquired disability\" is the result of impairments that occur suddenly or chronically during the lifespan, as opposed to being born with the impairment. \"Invisible disabilities\" may not be obviously noticeable.\nCures.\nThe medical model focuses heavily on finding treatments, cures, or rehabilitative practices for disabled people.\nAssistive technology.\nAssistive technology is a generic term for devices and modifications (for a person or within a society) that help overcome or remove a disability. The first recorded example of the use of a prosthesis dates to at least 1800 BC. The wheelchair dates from the 17th century. The curb cut is a related structural innovation. Other examples are standing frames, text telephones, accessible keyboards, large print, braille, and speech recognition software. Disabled people often develop adaptations which can be personal (e.g. strategies to suppress tics in public) or community (e.g. sign language in d/Deaf communities).\nAs the personal computer has become more ubiquitous, various organizations have formed to develop software and hardware to make computers more accessible for disabled people. Some software and hardware, such as Voice Finger, Freedom Scientific's \"JAWS\", the Free and Open Source alternative \"Orca\" etc. have been specifically designed for disabled people while other software and hardware, such as Nuance's Dragon NaturallySpeaking, were not developed specifically for disabled people, but can be used to increase accessibility. The LOMAK keyboard was designed in New Zealand specifically for persons with disabilities.\nThe World Wide Web consortium recognized a need for International Standards for Web Accessibility for persons with disabilities and created the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). As at Dec 2012 the standard is WCAG 2.0 (WCAG = Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).\nSocial model.\nThe social model of disability sees \"disability\" as a socially created problem and a matter of the full integration of individuals into society. In this model, disability is not an attribute of an individual, but rather a complex collection of conditions, created by the social environment. The management of the problem requires social action and it is the collective responsibility of society to create a society in which limitations for disabled people are minimal. Disability is both cultural and ideological in creation. According to the social model, equal access for someone with an impairment/disability is a human rights concern. The social model of disability has come under criticism. While recognizing the importance played by the social model in stressing the responsibility of society, scholars, including Tom Shakespeare, point out the limits of the model and urge the need for a new model that will overcome the \"medical vs. social\" dichotomy. The limitations of this model mean that often the vital services and information persons with disabilities face are simply not available, often due to limited economic returns in supporting them.\nSome say medical humanities is a fruitful field where the gap between the medical and the social model of disability might be bridged.\nSocial construction.\nThe social construction of disability is the idea that disability is constructed by social expectations and institutions rather than biological differences. Highlighting the ways society and institutions construct disability is one of the main focuses of this idea. In the same way that race and gender are not biologically fixed, neither is disability.\nAround the early 1970s, sociologists, notably Eliot Friedson, began to argue that labeling theory and social deviance could be applied to disability studies. This led to the creation of the social construction of disability theory. The social construction of disability is the idea that disability is constructed as the social response to a deviance from the norm. The medical industry is the creator of the ill and disabled social role. Medical professionals and institutions, who wield expertise over health, have the ability to define health and physical and mental norms. When an individual has a feature that creates an impairment, restriction, or limitation from reaching the social definition of health, the individual is labeled as disabled. Under this idea, disability is not defined by the physical features of the body but by a deviance from the social convention of health.\nThe social construction of disability would argue that the medical model of disability's view that a disability is an impairment, restriction, or limitation is wrong. Instead what is seen as a disability is just a difference in the individual from what is considered \"normal\" in society.\nTerminology.\nPeople-first language.\nPeople-first language is one way to talk about disability which some people prefer. Using people-first language is said to put the person before the disability. Those individuals who prefer people-first language would prefer to be called, \"a person with a disability\". This style is reflected in major legislation on disability rights, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\n\"Cerebral Palsy: A Guide for Care\" at the University of Delaware describes people-first language:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The American Psychological Association style guide states that, when identifying a person with a disability, the person's name or pronoun should come first, and descriptions of the disability should be used so that the disability is identified, but is not modifying the person. Acceptable examples included \"a woman with Down syndrome\" or \"a man who has schizophrenia\". It also states that a person's adaptive equipment should be described functionally as something that assists a person, not as something that limits a person, for example, \"a woman who uses a wheelchair\" rather than \"a woman in/confined to a wheelchair\".\nPeople-first terminology is used in the UK in the form \"people with impairments\" (such as \"people with visual impairments\"). However, in the UK, identity-first language is generally preferred over people-first language.\nThe use of people-first terminology has given rise to the use of the acronym PWD to refer to person(s) (or people) with disabilities (or disability). However other individuals and groups prefer identity-first language to emphasize how a disability can impact people's identities. Which style of language used varies between different countries, groups and individuals.\nIdentity-first language.\nIdentity-first language describes the person as \"disabled\". Some people prefer this and argue that this fits the social model of disability better than people-first language, as it emphasizes that the person is disabled not by their body, but by a world that does not accommodate them.\nThis is especially true in the UK, where it is argued under the social model that while someone's impairment (for example, having a spinal cord injury) is an individual property, \"disability\" is something created by external societal factors such as a lack of accessibility. This distinction between the individual property of impairment and the social property of disability is central to the social model. The term \"disabled people\" as a political construction is also widely used by international organizations of disabled people, such as Disabled Peoples' International.\nUsing the identity-first language also parallels how people talk about other aspects of identity and diversity. For example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the autism community, many self-advocates and their allies prefer terminology such as 'Autistic,' 'Autistic person,' or 'Autistic individual' because we understand autism as an inherent part of an individual's identity \u2013 the same way one refers to 'Muslims,' 'African-Americans,' 'Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender/Queer,' 'Chinese,' 'gifted,' 'athletic,' or 'Jewish.'\nSimilarly, Deaf communities in the US reject people-first language in favor of identity-first language.\nIn 2021, the US Association on Higher Education and Disability (AHEAD) announced their decision to use identity-first language in their materials, explaining:\n\"Identity-first language challenges negative connotations by claiming disability directly. Identity-first language references the variety that exists in how our bodies and brains work with a myriad of conditions that exist, and the role of inaccessible or oppressive systems, structures, or environments in making someone disabled.\"\nThe term \"handicap\" derives from the medieval game hand-in-cap, in which two players trade possessions, and a third, neutral person judges the difference of value between the possessions. The concept of a neutral person evening up the odds was extended to handicap racing in the mid-18th century, where horses carry different weights based on the umpire's estimation of what would make them run equally. In the early 20th century the word gained the additional meaning of describing a disability, in the sense that a person with a handicap was carrying a heavier burden than normal. This concept, then, adds to the conception of disability as a burden, or individual problem, rather than a societal problem. The UK government advises civil servants to avoid this term.\n Accessibility is the degree to which a product, service or environment is available for use to the people that need it. People with certain types of disabilities struggle to get equal access to some things in society. For example, a blind person cannot read printed paper ballots, and therefore does not have access to voting that requires paper ballots. Another example can be that a person in a wheelchair cannot ascend stairs and therefore does not have access to buildings without ramps. Accessible access to health clubs and fitness centers has been observed to be especially problematic.\n A change that improves access. For example, if voting ballots are available in braille or on a text-to-speech machine, or if another person reads the ballot to the blind person and recorded the choices, then the blind person would have access to voting.\nInvisible disability.\nInvisible disabilities, also known as Hidden Disabilities or Non-visible Disabilities (NVD), are disabilities that are not immediately apparent, or seeable. They are often chronic illnesses and conditions that significantly impair normal activities of daily living. Invisible disabilities can hinder a person's efforts to go to school, work, socialize, and more. Some examples of invisible disabilities include intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, fibromyalgia, mental disorders, asthma, epilepsy, allergies, migraines, arthritis, and chronic fatigue syndrome.\nEmployment discrimination is reported to play a significant part in the high rate of unemployment among those with a diagnosis of mental illness.\nEpisodic disability.\nPeople with health conditions such as arthritis, bipolar disorder, HIV, or multiple sclerosis may have periods of wellness between episodes of illness. During the illness episodes people's ability to perform normal tasks, such as work, can be intermittent.\nDisability activism.\nDisability activism itself has led to the revision of appropriate language, when discussing disability and disabled people. For example, the medical classification of 'retarded' has since been disregarded, due to its negative implications. Moreover, disability activism has also led to pejorative language being reclaimed by disabled people. Mairs (1986) explained how disabled people may choose to self-describe themselves as a 'cripple'. This may appear surprising that they are using stereotypically negative language associated with disability to describe themselves; however the purpose is to reclaim the 'disabled identity' from medical professionals, and realign it with the preferred language of disabled people. The reclamation of language demonstrated above positions itself within the social model, as it highlights how as a society we construct concepts and perceptions of disability.Disability activists have drawn attention to the following issues:\nRights and policies.\nRights movement.\nThe disability rights movement aims to secure equal opportunities and equal rights for disabled people. The specific goals and demands of the movement are accessibility and safety in transportation, architecture, and the physical environment; equal opportunities in independent living, employment, education, and housing; and freedom from abuse, neglect, and violations of patients' rights. Effective civil rights legislation is sought to secure these opportunities and rights.\nThe early disability rights movement was dominated by the medical model of disability, where emphasis was placed on curing or treating disabled people so that they would adhere to the social norm, but starting in the 1960s, rights groups began shifting to the social model of disability, where disability is interpreted as an issue of discrimination, thereby paving the way for rights groups to achieve equality through legal means.\nAdvocacy for disability issues and accessibility in the republics of the former Soviet Union has become more organized and influential in policymaking.\nDisability Justice Movement.\nEvolving from the disability rights movement is the Disability Justice movement, which aims to improve the lives of disabled people through prioritizing collective liberation, as opposed to prioritizing legislative change and traditional civil rights. This framework, dubbed the \"second wave\" of disability rights, seeks to examine the many systems of oppression that are intertwined with ableism, such colonialism, white supremacy, and heteropatriarchal capitalism. The term \"Disability Justice\" was coined in 2005 by LGBTQ disabled women of color, Mia Mingus, Patricia Berne, and Stacey Milbern, who sought to build an anti-ableist movement with a larger emphasis on intersectionality than mainstream disability rights, as to center marginalized voices. Their group, the Disability Justice Collective, also included notable disability activists such as Sebastian Margaret, Leroy F. Moore Jr., well known for his poetry and founding of the Krip Hop movement, and Eli Clare, well known for popularizing the bodymind concept within disability studies.\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\nOn December 13, 2006, the United Nations formally agreed on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the first human rights treaty of the 21st century, to protect and enhance the rights and opportunities of the world's estimated 650 million disabled people. As of January\u00a02021[ [update]], 182 nations have ratified or accepted accession to the convention. Countries that sign the convention are required to adopt national laws, and remove old ones, so that persons with disabilities will, for example, have equal rights to education, employment, and cultural life; to the right to own and inherit property; to not be discriminated against in marriage, etc.; and to not be unwilling subjects in medical experiments. UN officials, including the High Commissioner for Human Rights, have characterized the bill as representing a paradigm shift in attitudes toward a more rights-based view of disability in line with the social model.\nInternational Year of Disabled Persons.\nIn 1976, the United Nations began planning for its International Year of Disabled Persons (1981), later renamed the International Year of Disabled Persons. Some disability activists used the Year to highlight various injustices, such as in Australia where beauty pageants were targeted in order to, in the words of activist Leslie Hall, \"challenge the notion of beauty\" and \"reject the charity ethic. The UN Decade of Disabled Persons (1983\u20131993) featured a World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons. In 1979, Frank Bowe was the only person with a disability representing any country in the planning of IYDP-1981. Today, many countries have named representatives who are themselves individuals with disabilities. The decade was closed in an address before the General Assembly by Robert Davila. Both Bowe and Davila are deaf. In 1984, UNESCO accepted sign language for use in the education of deaf children and youth.\nPolicies in former Soviet Union republics.\nUN programs and OSCE work to align policy and programs in countries that were part of the former Soviet Union with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\nPolitical issues.\nPolitical rights, social inclusion and citizenship have come to the fore in developed and some developing countries. The debate has, some instances, moved beyond a concern about the perceived cost of maintaining dependent disabled people to finding effective ways to ensure that disabled people can participate in and contribute to society in all spheres of life.\nIn developing nations, where the vast bulk of the estimated 650 million disabled people reside, a great deal of work is needed to address concerns ranging from accessibility and education to self-empowerment, self-supporting employment, and beyond.\nIn the past few decades, the efforts of disability rights activists around the world, focused on obtaining full citizenship for disabled people, have come under academic study and gained some level of public recognition in many places, such as in the United States.\nThere are obstacles in many countries in getting full employment and public perception of disabled people varies.\nAbuse.\nDisability abuse happens when a person is abused physically, financially, verbally or mentally due to the person having a disability. As many disabilities are not visible (for example, asthma, learning disabilities) some abusers cannot rationalize the non-physical disability with a need for understanding, support, and so on.\nAs the prevalence of disability and the cost of supporting disability increases with medical advancement and longevity in general, this aspect of society becomes of greater political importance. How political parties treat their disabled constituents may become a measure of a political party's understanding of disability, particularly in the social model of disability.\nInsurance.\nDisability benefit, or disability pension, is a major kind of disability insurance that is provided by government agencies to people who are temporarily or permanently unable to work due to a disability. In the US, the disability benefit is provided in the category of Supplemental Security Income. In Canada, it is within the Canada Pension Plan. Following a long nationwide campaign involving hundreds of thousands of people the National Disability Insurance Scheme was introduced in Australia in 2013 to fund a number of supports.In other countries, disability benefits may be provided under social security systems.\nCosts of disability pensions are steadily growing in Western countries, mainly in Europe and the United States. It was reported that, in the UK, expenditure on disability pensions accounted for 0.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1980; two decades later it had reached 2.6% of GDP. Several studies have reported a link between increased absence from work due to sickness and elevated risk of future disability pension.\nA study by researchers in Denmark suggests that information on self-reported days of absence due to sickness can be used to effectively identify future potential groups for disability pension. These studies may provide useful information for policymakers, case managing authorities, employers, and physicians.\nIn Switzerland, social policies in the field of disability have been significantly reshaped over the last two decades by reducing the number of allowances awarded and by increasing the recourse to vocational rehabilitation measures. Drawing on interviews conducted with individuals who have been involved in programs set up by Swiss disability insurance, a study highlights their uncertainties and concerns relating to their place in society, as well as their reactions to disability insurance's interventions.\nPrivate, for-profit disability insurance plays a role in providing incomes to disabled people, but the nationalized programs are the safety net that catch most claimants.\nEmployment.\nStudies have illustrated a correlation between disability and poverty. Notably, jobs offered to disabled people are scarce. Marta Russell notes that \"[a] primary basis for oppression of disabled persons (those who could work with accommodations) is their exclusion from exploitation as wage laborers.\"\nIntellectual disability.\nMany countries have programs which aid intellectually disabled (ID) people to acquire skills needed in the workforce. Such programs include sheltered workshops and adult day care programs. Sheltered programs consist of daytime activities such as gardening, manufacturing, and assembling. These activities facilitate routine-oriented tasks that in turn allow ID people to gain experience before entering the workforce. Similarly, adult day care programs also include day time activities. However, these activities are based in an educational environment where ID people are able to engage in educational, physical, and communication-based tasks which helps facilitate communication, memory, and general living skills. In addition, adult day care programs arranged community activities by scheduling field trips to public places (e.g. zoos, and movie theaters). Despite both programs providing essential skills for intellectually disabled people prior to entering the workforce, researchers have found that ID people prefer to be involved with community-integrated employment. Community-integrated employment opportunities are offered to ID people at minimum or higher wages, in a variety of occupations ranging from customer service, clerical, janitorial, hospitality and manufacturing positions. ID employees work alongside employees without disabilities who are able to assist them with training. All three options allow intellectually disabled people to develop and exercise social skills that are vital to everyday life. However, it is not guaranteed that ID employees receive the same treatment as employees without ID; according to Lindstrom et al., community-integrated employees are less likely to receive raises, and only 26% are able to retain full-time status.\nFinding a stable workforce poses additional challenges. A study published in the \"Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disability\" indicated that although finding a job may be difficult, stabilizing a job is even harder. Chadsey-Rusch proposed that securing employment for ID people requires adequate production skills and effective social skills. Other underlying factors for job loss include structural factors and worker-workplace integration. As stated by Kilsby, limited structural factors can affect a multitude of factors in a job, such as a restricted number of hours an ID person is allowed to work. This in return, according to Fabian et al., leads to a lack of opportunity to develop relationships with coworkers or to better integrate within the workplace. Nevertheless, those who are unable to stabilize a job often are left discouraged. According to the same study conducted by JARID, many who had participated found that they had made smaller incomes when compared to their co-workers, had an excess of time throughout their days, because they did not have work. They also had feelings of hopelessness and failure. According to the US National Organization on Disability, not only do ID people face constant discouragement, but many live below the poverty line, because they are unable to find or stabilize employment and because of employee restricting factors placed on ID workers. This renders ID people unable to provide for themselves, including basic necessities such as food, medical care, transportation, and housing.\nPoverty.\nThe poverty rate for working-age people with disabilities is nearly two and a half times higher than that for people without disabilities. Disability and poverty may form a vicious circle, in which physical barriers and stigma of disability make it more difficult to get income, which in turn diminishes access to health care and other necessities for a healthy life. In societies without state funded health and social services, living with a disability could require spending on medication and frequent health care visits, in-home personal assistance, and adaptive devices and clothing, along with the usual costs of living. The World report on disability indicates that half of all disabled people cannot afford health care, compared to a third of abled people. In countries without public services for adults with disabilities, their families may be impoverished.\nDisasters.\nThere is limited research knowledge, but many anecdotal reports, on what happens when disasters impact disabled people. Individuals with disabilities are greatly affected by disasters. Those with physical disabilities can be at risk when evacuating if assistance is not available. Individuals with cognitive impairments may struggle with understanding instructions that must be followed in the event a disaster occurs. All of these factors can increase the degree of variation of risk in disaster situations with disabled individuals.\nResearch studies have consistently found discrimination against individuals with disabilities during all phases of a disaster cycle. The most common limitation is that people cannot physically access buildings or transportation, as well as access disaster-related services. The exclusion of these individuals is caused in part by the lack of disability-related training provided to emergency planners and disaster relief personnel.\nDisability in society.\nAging.\nTo a certain degree, physical impairments and changing mental states are almost ubiquitously experienced by people as they age. Aging populations are often stigmatized for having a high prevalence of disability. Kathleen Woodward, writing in \"Key Words for Disability Studies\", explains the phenomenon as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Aging is invoked rhetorically\u00a0\u2013 at times ominously\u00a0\u2013 as a pressing reason why disability should be of crucial interest to all of us (we are all getting older, we will all be disabled eventually), thereby inadvertently reinforcing the damaging and dominant stereotype of aging as solely an experience of decline and deterioration. But little attention has been given to the imbrication of aging and disability.\nIn \"Feminist, Queer, Crip\", Alison Kafer mentions aging and the anxiety associated with it. According to Kafer, this anxiety stems from ideas of normalcy. She says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Anxiety about aging, for example, can be seen as a symptom of compulsory able-bodiedness/able-mindedness, as can attempts to \"treat\" children who are slightly shorter than average with growth hormones; in neither case are the people involved necessarily disabled, but they are certainly affected by cultural ideals of normalcy and ideal form and function.\nSocietal norms.\nIn contexts where their differences are visible, persons with disabilities often face stigma. People frequently react to disabled presence with fear, pity, patronization, intrusive gazes, revulsion, or disregard. These reactions can, and often do, exclude persons with disabilities from accessing social spaces along with the benefits and resources these spaces provide. Disabled writer/researcher Jenny Morris describes how stigma functions to marginalize persons with disabilities:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Going out in public so often takes courage. How many of us find that we can't dredge up the strength to do it day after day, week after week, year after year, a lifetime of rejection and revulsion? It is not only physical limitations that restrict us to our homes and those whom we know. It is the knowledge that each entry into the public world will be dominated by stares, by condescension, by pity, and by hostility.\nAdditionally, facing stigma can cause harm to the psycho-emotional well-being of the person being stigmatized. One of the ways in which the psycho-emotional health of persons with disabilities is adversely affected is through the internalization of the oppression they experience, which can lead to feeling that they are weak, crazy, worthless or any number of other negative attributes that may be associated with their conditions. Internalization of oppression damages the self-esteem of the person affected and shapes their behaviors in ways that are compliant with dominance of those with no acknowledged disability. Ableist ideas are frequently internalized when disabled people are pressured by the people and institutions around them to hide and downplay their disabled difference, or, \"pass\". According to writer Simi Linton, the act of passing takes a deep emotional toll by causing disabled individuals to experience loss of community, anxiety and self-doubt. The media play a significant role in creating and reinforcing stigma associated with disability. Media portrayals of disability usually cast disabled presence as necessarily marginal within society at large. These portrayals simultaneously reflect and influence the popular perception of disabled difference.\nTropes.\nThere are distinct tactics that the media frequently employ in representing disability. These common ways of framing disability are heavily criticized for being dehumanizing and failing to place importance on the perspectives of persons with disabilities. As outlined by disability theorist and rhetorician Jay Timothy Dolmage, ableist media tropes can reflect and continue to perpetuate societal myths about disabled people.\nInspiration porn.\nInspiration porn refers to portrayals of persons with disabilities in which they are presented as being inspiring simply because the person has a disability. These portrayals are criticized because they are created with the intent of making viewers with no acknowledged disability feel better about themselves in comparison to the individual portrayed. Rather than recognizing the humanity of persons with disabilities, inspiration porn turns them into objects of inspiration for an audience composed of those with no acknowledged disability.\nSupercrip.\nThe supercrip trope refers to instances when the media reports on or portray a disabled person who has made a noteworthy achievement but centers on their disability rather than what they actually did. They are portrayed as awe-inspiring for being exceptional compared to others with the same or similar conditions. This trope is widely used in reporting on disabled athletes as well as in portrayals of autistic savants.\nThese representations, notes disability scholar Ria Cheyne, \"are widely assumed to be inherently regressive\", reducing people to their condition rather than viewing them as full people. Furthermore, supercrip portrayals are criticized for creating the unrealistic expectation that disability should be accompanied by some type of special talent, genius, or insight.\nExamples of this trope in the media include Dr. Shaun Murphy from \"The Good Doctor\", Marvel's Daredevil, and others.\nScholar Sami Schalk argues that the term supercrip has a narrow definition given how widely used the term is. As a result, Schlak provides three categories of supercrip narratives used:\nDisabled villain.\nCharacters in fiction that bear physical or mental markers of difference from perceived societal norms are frequently positioned as villains within a text. Lindsey Row-Heyveld shares ways students should be taught to begin to further analyze this issue. Disabled people's visible differences from the abled majority are meant to evoke fear in audiences that can perpetuate the mindset of disabled people being a threat to individual or public interests and well-being.\nDisability drop.\nThe \"disability drop\" trope is when a supposedly disabled character is revealed to have been faking, embellishing, or otherwise not actually embodying their claimed disability. Jay Dolmage offers Kevin Spacey's character, Verbal Kint, in the film \"Usual Suspects\" as an example of this, and depictions like this can reflect able-bodied society's mistrust of disabled people. In addition, this reveal of a character's nondisabledness often serves as the narrative climax of a story, and the use of disability as a source of conflict in the plot, narrative obstacle, or a device of characterization aligns with other disability studies scholars' theory of \"Narrative Prosthesis\", a term coined by David T. Mitchell and Sharon Snyder.\nThe disabled victim.\nAnother frequent occurrence is when someone with a disability is assumed to be miserable or helpless.\n\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame's\" Quasimodo, \"The Elephant Man's\" John Merrick, \"A Christmas Carol's\" Tiny Tim, and even news broadcasts that refer to people as \"victims\" or \"sufferers\" are a few examples of this stereotype.\nEternally Innocent.\nCharacters with disabilities are frequently portrayed in movies as being angelic or childish. These films include \"Rain Man\" (1988), \"Forrest Gump\" (1994) and \"I Am Sam\" (2001).\nThe innocent and endearing person with a disability often points out the inadequacies of their \"normal\" adult peers, which helps them achieve salvation.\nLike all the others, this stereotype perpetuates patronizing perceptions that are simply untrue and are therefore damaging.\nWhile there are many disability tropes, disability aesthetics attempts to dispel them by accurately depicting disabled bodies in art and media.\nSelf-advocacy.\nSome disabled people have attempted to resist marginalization through the use of the social model in opposition to the medical model; with the aim of shifting criticism away from their bodies and impairments and towards the social institutions that oppress them relative to their abled peers. Disability activism that demands many grievances be addressed, such as lack of accessibility, poor representation in media, general disrespect, and lack of recognition, originates from a social model framework.\nThe creation of \"disability culture\" stemmed from the shared experience of stigmatization in broader society. Embracing disability as a positive identity by becoming involved in disabled communities and participating in disability culture can be an effective way to combat internalized prejudice; and can challenge dominant narratives about disability.\nIntersections.\nThe experiences that disabled people have to navigate social institutions vary greatly as a function of what other social categories they may belong to. For example, a disabled man and a disabled woman experience disability differently. This speaks to the concept of intersectionality, which explains that different aspects of a person's identity (such as their gender, race, sexuality, religion, or social class) intersect and create unique experiences of oppression and privilege. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities differentiates between a few kinds of disability intersections, such as the age-disability, race-disability, and gender-disability intersection. However, many more intersections exist. Disability is defined differently by each person; it may be visible or invisible, and multiple intersections often arise from overlapping identity categories.\nRace.\nIncidence of disability is reported to be greater among several minority communities across the globe, according to a systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study. Disabled people who are also racial minorities generally have less access to support and are more vulnerable to violent discrimination. A study in the journal \"Child Development\" indicated that minority disabled children are more likely to receive punitive discipline in low and middle income countries. Due to the fact that children with disabilities are mistreated more often than those without disability; racialized children in this category are at an even higher risk. With respect to disability in the United States, Camille A. Nelson, writing for the \"Berkeley Journal of Criminal Law\", notes the dual discrimination that racial minorities with disabilities experience from the criminal justice system, expressing that for \"people who are negatively racialized, that is people who are perceived as being non-white, and for whom mental illness is either known or assumed, interaction with police is precarious and potentially dangerous.\"\nGender.\nThe marginalization of people with disabilities can leave persons with disabilities unable to actualize what society expects of gendered existence. This lack of recognition for their gender identity can leave persons with disabilities with feelings of inadequacy. Thomas J. Gerschick of Illinois State University describes why this denial of gendered identity occurs:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Bodies operate socially as canvases on which gender is displayed and kinesthetically as the mechanisms by which it is physically enacted. Thus, the bodies of people with disabilities make them vulnerable to being denied recognition as women and men.\nTo the extent that women and men with disabilities are gendered, the interactions of these two identities lead to different experiences. Women with disabilities face a sort of \"double stigmatization\" in which their membership to both of these marginalized categories simultaneously exacerbates the negative stereotypes associated with each as they are ascribed to them. However, according to the framework of intersectionality, gender and disability intersect to create a unique experience that is not simply the coincidence of being a woman and having a disability separately, but the unique experience of being a woman with a disability. It follows that the more marginalized groups one belongs to, their experience of privilege or oppression changes: in short, a black woman and a white woman will experience disability differently.\nAccording to The UN Woman Watch, \"Persistence of certain cultural, legal and institutional barriers makes women and girls with disabilities the victims of two-fold discrimination: as women and as persons with disabilities.\" As Rosemarie Garland-Thomson puts it, \"Women with disabilities, even more intensely than women in general, have been cast in the collective cultural imagination as inferior, lacking, excessive, incapable, unfit, and useless.\"\nSocio-economic background.\nSimilar to the intersections of race and disability or gender and disability, a person's socio-economic background will also change their experience of disability. A disabled person with a low socio-economic status will experience the world differently, with more obstacles and fewer opportunities, than a disabled person with a high socio-economic status.\nA good example of the intersection between disability and socio-economic status is access to education, as we know that there are direct links between poverty and disability - often working in a vicious cycle. The costs of special education and caring for a disabled child are higher than for a child with no acknowledged disability, which poses an immense barrier in accessing appropriate education. The inaccessibility of appropriate education (at any stage), can lead to difficulties in finding employment, which often results in the vicious cycle of being 'bound' by one's experience as a poor and disabled person to remain in the same social structure and experience socio-economic exclusion. In short, this vicious cycle exacerbates the lack of economic, social, and cultural capital for disabled people with a low socio-economic background. On the other hand, a disabled person of a high socio-economic status, may have an easier time accessing appropriate (special) education or treatment - for example by having access to better aids, resources, or programmes that can help them succeed.\nDisability culture.\nSport.\nThe Paralympic Games (meaning \"alongside the Olympics\") are held after the (Summer and Winter) Olympics. The Paralympic Games include athletes with a wide range of physical disabilities. In member countries, organizations exist to organize competition in the Paralympic sports on levels ranging from recreational to elite (for example, Disabled Sports USA and BlazeSports America in the United States).\nThe Paralympics developed from a rehabilitation program for British war veterans with spinal injuries. In 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttman, a neurologist working with World War II veterans with spinal injuries at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury in the UK, began using sport as part of the rehabilitation programs of his patients.\nIn 2006, the Extremity Games were formed for physically disabled people, specifically limb loss or limb difference, to be able to compete in extreme sports.\nDemographics.\nEstimates of worldwide and country-wide numbers of disabled people are problematic. The varying approaches taken to defining disability notwithstanding, demographers agree that the world population of individuals with disabilities is very large. For example, in 2012, the World Health Organization estimated a world population of 6.5 billion people. Of those, nearly 650 million people, or 10%, were estimated to be moderately or severely disabled. In 2018 the International Labour Organization estimated that about a billion people, one-seventh of the world population, had disabilities, 80% of them in developing countries, and 80% of working age. Excluding disabled people from the workforce was reckoned to cost up to 7% of gross domestic product.\nUnited States.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control's Morbidity and Mortality weekly report, one-fourth of people in the United States are reported to be disabled as of 2016. 10% of young adults were reported to have mental disabilities. The rates of mobility-related issues were highest among middle-aged people and elderly people, with 18.1% and 26.9%, respectively. In terms of race or ethnicity, Asians have the lowest reported rate of disability at around 10%, while Native Americans, the ethnic group with the highest reported incidence, are reported to have a disability rate at an estimated 30% of adults. African Americans had a higher reported disability rate of 25%, compared to 16% for white adults and 17% for Hispanic people.\nCanada.\n22.3% of Canadians over 15 are reported to have a disability, or 6,246,640 people, according to the 2017 Canadian Survey on Disability Reports. In Canada, women and older people are more likely to be disabled than working-class men. In comparison to working-age persons between 25 and 65, seniors over 65 reported a disability rate of 38%, which is nearly twice as high. In Canada, women over 15 had a reported disability rate of 24.3%, compared to men's 20%. According to reports from the 2017 Canadian Survey of Disability, South Asians over the age of 15 in Canada had the greatest proportion of disability at 4%, while Latin Americans had a lower rate at 1%.\nAustralia.\nNearly one in five Australians, or 4.4 million people, were estimated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to have a disability. A mental or behavioral issue was reported in over 25% of Australians with disabilities. Male prevalence was 17.6 million, while female prevalence was somewhat higher at 17.8 million between the sexes. Age-wise, 11.6% of adults between 0 and 64 in Australia had a disability, compared to 49.6% of seniors 65 and over. 53.4% of Australians aged 15 to 64 who have a disability are employed.\nUnited Kingdom.\nAccording to the House of Commons Library, 14.6 million, or 22%, of the population in the UK, were reported to be disabled in 2020\u20132021. In the UK, there were 9% of children, 21% of working-age people, and 42% of persons over the state pension age who were disabled or impaired. Approximately 29% of White individuals, 27% of mixed-race people, 22% of Asian people, 21% of Black people, and 19% of people from other ethnic groups were reported as having impairments or disabilities, according to the Life Opportunities Survey, which surveyed 35,875 people in 2011. When compared to men, women are a little more likely than men to have a disability, with 31% of women reportedly having one as opposed to 26% of men, according to results of another survey taken the same year.\nChina.\nAccording to Twenty-Year Trends in the Prevalence of Disability in China, a medical publication from the National Library of Medicine, there were an estimated 84.6 million Chinese individuals living with a disability in 2006. In a 2006 poll of 83,342 men and 78,137 women, the age groups with the highest reported rates of disability are 18\u201344-year-old males (22.5%) and 65\u201374-year-old females (22.8%), according to polls published in the journal that were representative of the country as a whole. In China, the percentage of people with disabilities varies substantially between urban and rural regions, with men and women having reported rates of\u00a072.4% and 72.2%, respectively, in rural China, compared to reported rates of 27.6% and 27.8%, respectively, in urban China. Hearing and speech disabilities are the most commonly reported in China, with men being more affected than women at rates 39.6% and 36.2% among disabled people, respectively.\nSouth Korea.\nIn South Korea, there were accounted to be 2.517 million people with disabilities in total, or roughly 5.0% of the population, in 2018. When compared to Koreans without disabilities, people with disabilities spent an average of 56.5 days in medical facilities, which was 2.6 more than the national average. 34.9% of the entire workforce was employed in jobs connected to disabilities. Families with disabilities made an average income of 41.53 million won, or 71.3% of total family earnings. According to the Korean 2020 Statistics on the Disabled The majority of persons with disabilities needed help with \"cleaning\" and \"using transportation\", among other everyday tasks.\nDeveloping nations.\nDisability is more common in developing than in developed nations. The connection between disability and poverty is thought to be part of a \"vicious cycle\" in which these constructs are mutually reinforcing.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt; \nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She subsequently joined Acorn Computers and was instrumental in designing the BBC Microcomputer, including the BBC BASIC programming language. She first began designing the ARM reduced instruction set computer (RISC) in 1983, which entered production two years later. It became popular in embedded systems and is now the most widely used processor architecture in smartphones. In 2011, she was listed in \"Maximum PC\" as number 8 in an article titled \"The 15 Most Important Women in Tech History\". She was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2019.\nEarly life and education.\nWilson was born in Leeds to schoolteacher parents, her father specialising in English and her mother in physics. She spent her childhood in the village of Burn Bridge, North Yorkshire. After secondary schooling at Harrogate Grammar School, in 1976 Wilson went up to Selwyn College, Cambridge, where she studied mathematics for her first two years, switching to computer science in her final year. She was a member of the university Microprocessor society.\nCareer.\nBefore going to university, Wilson had designed and built two electronic systems for ICI Fibres Research in Harrogate near her home village. The following year, in the 1977 summer vacation after her first year at university, she designed a small system around a MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor, which was used to electronically control feed for cows.\nWilson's success with the cow-feeder project and paper designs for a more general system based on it caught the notice of Hermann Hauser, at the time a Cambridge postgraduate student. Hauser was impressed, and supported Wilson to stay in Cambridge for the 1978 summer vacation to see if she could turn the design into reality. At the same time a small microcomputer kit, the MK14, was just being launched by Science of Cambridge, led by Chris Curry on behalf of Cambridge electronics businessman Clive Sinclair. Wilson was convinced she could do better, and Hauser encouraged her to do so, using parts from the MK14.\nIn December 1978 Hauser and Curry set up Cambridge Processor Unit Ltd (CPU), initially as a consultancy designing microprocessor-based control systems. Their first customer was Ace Coin Equipment Ltd, who needed controllers for their fruit machines, with Wilson designing a device to prevent cigarette lighter sparks triggering payouts. Meanwhile Wilson's computer design, combined with a cassette interface designed by Steve Furber, became the Acorn Micro-Computer, the first of a long line of computers sold by the company. Wilson started at the company in 1979.\nBased on this processor board CPU Ltd developed an increasing number of different interface, display, control, and test add-ons for different customers, which in turn led to the Acorn Eurocard rack systems that were made generally available, and then the Acorn Atom released in March 1980. Wilson, initially moonlighting from the final year of her degree, contributed first the machine code monitor, then an assembler, then a version of BASIC and multiple device drivers for the machines (\"an incredible task of bootstrapping things up\"), as well as pitching in with everything else in the office.\nBBC Micro.\nWilson was at the forefront of creating the prototype that enabled Acorn to win the contract with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for their ambitious computer education project.\nThe BBC had planned that the centrepiece of their project would be an upcoming TV series that would relate the possibilities that computers were opening up to demonstrations shown running on a standard reference microcomputer, that viewers would then be able to experiment with themselves. However by the end of 1980 it had become clear that the BBC's intended machine, the government-backed Newbury Newbrain, would not be able to meet either the capability or the timetable the BBC sought, and the programme team began an urgent search for other options. Curry pressed the already existing Acorn Atom, but when this was rejected at the start of February 1981 as being too limited and too non-standard, Curry instead offered for the BBC to come to Cambridge the following week to view a prototype of Acorn's next computer \u2013 a machine that in reality did not as yet exist, beyond some general design discussion and a name, the Acorn Proton. Hauser employed a deception, telling both Wilson and colleague Steve Furber that the other had agreed a prototype could be built within a week. Taking up the challenge, the Acorn team designed the system including the circuit board and components from Monday to Wednesday, which required fast new DRAM integrated circuits to be sourced directly from Hitachi. By Thursday evening, a prototype had been built, but it was only on Friday morning that it was actually working, allowing Wilson (who had managed to catch a few hours sleep in the night) to start porting over an operating system, in time to be able to show it consistently drawing a line to a high-res graphics screen by the time the BBC arrived, with full text and graphics on screen by the time the BBC returned from an unproductive visit to the nearby Sinclair Research. \nThe Proton was accepted to become the BBC Micro, with it falling to Wilson to develop its operating system and its version of BASIC, BBC BASIC \u2013 at 16K and 16K respectively a fourfold increase on the 4K and 4K of the Atom, including a full set of floating point mathematical routines. Wilson's \"Acorn SuperBASIC\" development had reached about 10K by the time of the BBC's visit, and she was keen to preserve the improvements she considered she had made with Acorn System BASIC over previous versions of the language. But the BBC, in particular their external consultant John Coll and BBC Engineering's Richard Russell, were adamant that the core established features of the language needed to be present with recognisably standard syntax. On the other hand extensions that Wilson had written to allow more structured programming in BASIC chimed closely with the BBC team's ambitions, and long fully-significant variable names, repeat/until loops, and multi-line procedures and functions with variables that could be declared local all became hallmarks of BBC BASIC. Work on the system design, operating system, and BASIC language (and fitting everything into the memory available) continued through the summer, and Wilson recalled watching the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer in July 1981 on a small portable television while attempting to debug and re-solder the prototype. Along with Furber, Wilson was present backstage at the machine's first studio recordings for television, in case any software fixes were required. She later described the event as \"a unique moment in time when the public wanted to know how this stuff works and could be shown and taught how to program.\"\nARM processor.\nIn October 1983, Wilson began designing the instruction set for one of the first reduced instruction set computer (RISC) processors, the Acorn RISC Machine (ARM). The ARM1 was delivered on 26 April 1985 and worked first time, entering into production the same year. This processor type was later to become one of the most successful IP cores \u2013 a licensed CPU core \u2013 and by 2012 was being used in 95% of smartphones. Wilson also designed Acorn Replay, the video architecture for Acorn machines. This included operating system extensions for video access, as well as the codecs, optimised to run high frame rate video on ARM CPUs from the ARM 2 onwards.\nShe was a non-executive director of the technology and games company Eidos plc, which bought and created Eidos Interactive, for the years following its flotation in 1990. She was a consultant to ARM Ltd when it was split off from Acorn in 1990.\nSince the demise of Acorn Computers, Wilson has made a small number of public appearances to talk about work done there.\nFirepath.\nWilson was the Chief Architect of Broadcom's Firepath processor. Firepath has its history in Acorn Computers, which, after being renamed to Element 14, was broken up in an acquisition, with the Element 14 name being transferred to a new company, this company eventually being bought by Broadcom in 2000. In 2001 she became a research fellow and director at Broadcom.\nWilson was listed in 2011 in \"Maximum PC\" as number 8 in an article titled \"The 15 Most Important Women in Tech History\".\nHonours and awards.\nWilson was awarded the Fellow Award by the Computer History Museum in California in 2012 \"for her work, with Steve Furber, on the BBC Micro computer and the ARM processor architecture.\" In 2009, she was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and, in 2013, as a Fellow of the Royal Society. Wilson received the 2014 Lovie Lifetime Achievement Award in acknowledgement for her invention of the ARM processor. In 2016, she became an honorary fellow of her alma mater, Selwyn College, Cambridge, and was received the Royal Society Mullard Award with Furber for their work on ARM. In 2020, she was honoured as a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society.\nWilson was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to computing.\nIn 2022, the Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering was awarded in Washington D.C. to David A. Patterson, John L. Hennessy, Stephen B. Furber, and Sophie M. Wilson for their \"invention, development, and implementation\" of the RISC chips.\nThe Sophie Wilson scholarship for Scientific Computing was set up in 2024, and is co-funded by Wilson. It supports students to study in the MPhil in Scientific Computing at the University of Cambridge.\nPersonal life.\nWilson medically transitioned in 1994. She enjoys photography and is involved in a local theatre group, where she is in charge of costumes and set pieces and has acted in a number of productions. She has also played a cameo role as a pub landlady in the BBC television drama \"Micro Men\", in which a younger Wilson is played by Stefan Butler.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He spent two years in the RAF (1950\u20131952), and worked as a science journalist and writer until 1957, when he began a B.A. course in Psychology at University College London, graduating with honours in 1960. After a summer fellowship at Duke University in the United States, where he first met his American wife, Nancy Fullmer, he took up a research assistant post in the Physics Laboratory, University of Reading, working on eye movements under Professor R. W. Ditchburn. Upon receiving his PhD (the title of his thesis was \"Pattern Perception and the Stabilised Retinal Image\"), he went to the Division of Computer Science, National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, in 1964, where he remained until his death from cancer in 1979. He had two children, Christopher Samuel Evans and Victoria Evans-Theiler.\nWorks.\nIn 1979, Christopher Evans wrote a book about the oncoming microcomputer revolution, \"The Mighty Micro: The Impact of the Computer Revolution\", which included predictions for the future up to the year 2000. This book was also printed in the US as \"The Micro Millennium\" (New York: The Viking Press, ). He subsequently scripted and presented for ATV a six-part television series based on this book and broadcast posthumously by ITV between October and December 1979.\nHis other books include \"Cults of Unreason\", a study of Scientology and other pseudoscience, and \"Landscapes of the Night: How and Why We Dream\".\nIn the 1970s, Evans undertook a set of interviews with computer pioneers such as Konrad Zuse and Grace Hopper. These were released through the Science Museum, London, as \"Pioneers of Computing\", a set of cassette tapes.\nChristopher Evans also edited two anthologies of psychological science fiction/horror stories, \"Mind at Bay\" and \"Mind in Chains\", a collection of science writings, \"Cybernetics: Key Papers\", a reference book \"Psychology: A Dictionary of Mind, Brain and Behaviour\", and was a contributing editor to the science magazine \"Omni\". A keen pilot, he also edited a yearly pilot's diary of rural airfields in Great Britain.\nEvans had a significant friendship and collaboration with the writer J. G. Ballard. Together around 1968 they developed ideas for a play about a car crash, offered to\nthe Institute of Contemporary Arts but not produced.\nLater came an exhibition of crashed cars at The New Arts Lab in London in 1970, and ultimately Ballard's novel\nCrash, published in 1973. Evans' charismatic appearance as a \"hoodlum scientist\" (in Ballard's description) was an inspiration for the\ncharacter of Dr. Robert Vaughan in Crash. Evans also appears in Ballard's fictionalised life story The Kindness of Women\nas the psychologist Dr. Richard Sutherland. (Ballard recounts his friendship with Evans in his autobiography Miracles of Life.)\nDuring the 1970s, Evans was the scientific advisor to the ITV TV series, \"The Tomorrow People\".\nChristopher Evans died of cancer in 1979, at the age of 48, shortly after \"The Mighty Micro\" had been published in hardcover and before the broadcast of the TV programmes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1931 Britain met the conditions to retain the Trophy permanently; it is on display at the Science Museum in South Kensington, London.\nAnnounced in 1912 by Jacques Schneider, a French financier, balloonist and aircraft enthusiast, the competition offered a prize of approximately \u00a31,000. The race was held twelve times between 1913 and 1931, the year when it was finally won permanently by the British. It was intended to encourage technical advances in civil aviation but became a contest for pure speed with laps over a (usually) triangular course, initially and later extended to . The contests were staged as time trials, with aircraft setting off individually at set intervals, usually 15 minutes apart. The contests were very popular, and some of them attracted crowds of over 200,000 spectators.\nThe race was significant in advancing aeroplane design, particularly in the fields of aerodynamics and engine design, and showed its results in the best fighters of World War II. The streamlined shape and the low drag, liquid-cooled engine pioneered by Schneider Trophy designs are obvious in the British Supermarine Spitfire, the American North American P-51 Mustang, and the Italian Macchi C.202 \"Folgore\".\nAn earlier 1910 trophy for land planes presented by Jacques Schneider, in France, the \"Grande Semaine d'Aviation de Tours\", in the possession of the RAF College Cranwell, is also known as the Schneider Cup.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRules.\nAircraft taking part had to be seaworthy, having to float for six hours and travel about 550 yards (503m) on water. Twice during the flight they had to land on or \"come in contact\" with the water (which allowed contestants to carry out a fast bouncing manoeuvre). If the pontoons took on water, the flight had to continue with the added weight. Each competition was to be held in and managed by the country currently holding the trophy. If a country won three consecutive races, as the British finally did, they would retain the trophy permanently and the winning pilot would receive 75,000 French francs for each of the first three wins. The races were supervised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale and the aero club in the hosting country. Each club could enter up to three competitors with an equal number of alternatives.\nTrophy.\nThe Schneider Trophy is a sculpture of silver and bronze set on a marble base. It depicts a zephyr skimming the waves, and a nude winged figure is seen kissing a zephyr recumbent on a breaking wave. The heads of two other zephyrs and of Neptune, the god of the Sea, can be seen surrounded by octopus and crabs. The symbolism represents speed conquering the elements of sea and air. The cost of the trophy was 25,000 francs.\nAfter the British finally won permanent possession of the trophy in 1931, the sculpture was displayed for many years at the end of the corridor outside the ballroom of the Lansdowne Club. It has since been entrusted to the Royal Aero Club and can be viewed along with the winning Supermarine S.6B floatplane at the London Science Museum Flight exhibition hall. Supermarine S.6, \"N248\", which competed in the 1929 contest but was disqualified, is preserved at Solent Sky maritime museum in Southampton.\nHistory.\nSchneider was a hydroplane racer who came from a wealthy family; his interest in aircraft began after he met Wilbur Wright in 1908, but a boating accident in 1910 crippled him and prematurely ended his racing and flying career. Schneider served as a race referee at the Monaco Hydroplane Meet in 1912, where he noted that seaplane development was lagging land-based aircraft; seeking to spur amphibious aircraft development, capable of reliable operation, extended range, and reasonable payload capacity, he announced the annual Schneider Trophy competition at a race banquet on 5 December, to cover a distance of at least .\nThe first competition was held on 16 April 1913, at Monaco, consisting of six laps, distance in total. It was won by Maurice Pr\u00e9vost, piloting a French Deperdussin Monocoque (Coupe Schneider) at an average speed of . Although Pr\u00e9vost had averaged a faster flying speed, he lost 50 minutes when he landed prematurely after losing count of the laps completed. All four entrants were flying French-made aircraft; two withdrew before completing the race. The British won in 1914 with a Sopwith Tabloid flown by Howard Pixton at ; the 1914 race was contested by three nations: France, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. The United States and Germany failed to qualify. From 1915 to 1918, competition was suspended for the duration of World War I.\nAfter the war, the competition resumed in 1919 at Bournemouth where in foggy conditions the Italian team won. They were later disqualified and the race was voided, as the referees ruled they had incorrectly flown around a marker buoy. In 1920 and 1921 at Venice the Italians won again; in 1920 no other nation entered and in 1921 the French entry did not start.\u00a0 Had it not been for the 1919 disqualification, Italy would have been awarded the trophy permanently. After 1921, an additional requirement was added: the winning seaplane had to remain moored to a buoy for six hours without human intervention.\nIn 1922 in Naples the British and French competed with the Italians. The British private entry, a Supermarine Sea Lion II, was the victor, flown by Henry Biard. The French aircraft did not start the race, which became a competition between the Sea Lion and three Italian aircraft, two Macchi M.17s and a Savoia S.51.\nNationalism.\nThe 1923 trophy, contested at Cowes, went to the Americans with a sleek, liquid-cooled engined craft designed by Glenn Curtiss. It used the Curtiss D-12 engine. U.S. Navy Lieutenant David Rittenhouse won the cup, and his teammate Rutledge Irvine was second in an identical aircraft. The British Sea Lion III (flown by 1922 winner Henry Biard), and the French entry withdrew from the race. The preparation of the United States team, backed by government support and using Curtiss racing biplanes derived from inter-military competitions, increased the speed and the investment of a winning entry significantly. In 1924 the competition was cancelled as no other nation turned out to face the Americans: the Italians and the French withdrew; and both British craft crashed in pre-race trials. In 1925 at Chesapeake Bay the Americans won again, with U.S. pilot Jimmy Doolittle winning in a Curtiss R3C ahead of the British Gloster III and the Italian Macchi M.33. R. J. Mitchell's Supermarine S.4 and the other Gloster III were damaged before the race and did not compete. Two of the American planes did not finish.\nBenito Mussolini instructed the Italian aircraft industry to \"win the Schneider Trophy at all costs\" and so demonstrate the effectiveness of his Fascist government. In 1926, the Italians returned with a Macchi M.39 and won against the Americans with a run at Hampton Roads. The United States, short of funds, did not develop new aircraft for the 1926 title defence; the M.39, designed by Mario Castoldi, used a Fiat AS2 engine and was streamlined in the manner of the 1925 Supermarine and Curtiss entrants. The American teams withdrew from further competition after the 1926 race, as the military was unwilling to fund entrants. In 1927 at Venice the British responded by enlisting government backing and RAF pilots (the High Speed Flight) for the Supermarine, Gloster, and Shorts entries. Supermarine's Mitchell-designed S.5s took first and second places; no other entrants finished. The race was witnessed by an estimated 250,000 spectators. 1927 was the last annual competition, the event was then mutually agreed to be held biennially to allow more development time.\nIn 1929, at Calshot, Supermarine won again in the Supermarine S.6 with the new Rolls-Royce R engine with an average speed of . Both Britain and Italy entered two new aircraft and a backup plane from the previous race. Three of the four new aircraft were disqualified (Supermarine S.6 \"N.248\") or failed to finish the course (both Macchi M.67s), with the older Macchi M.52R taking second and Supermarine S.5 taking third. Although France had ordered racing seaplanes from Bernard and Nieuport-Delage in 1928, they were unable to complete them in time for the 1929 race.\nThe UK win.\nIn 1931 the British government withdrew support, but a private donation of \u00a3100,000 from the wealthy and ultra-patriotic Lucy, Lady Houston, allowed Supermarine to compete. When the French and Italian teams dropped out, leaving no other competitors, the British team flew the course alone on 13 September and won the coveted Schneider Trophy outright, having beaten the time record from the 1929 competition. Reportedly half a million spectators lined the beachfronts. The Italian, French, and German entrants failed to ready their aircraft in time for the competition. The remaining British team set both a new world speed record of and won the trophy outright with a third straight win. The following days saw the winning Supermarine S.6B further break the world speed record twice, making it the first craft to break the 400\u00a0mph barrier on 29 September at an average speed of .\nAlthough the British team had secured the trophy for the UK permanently with the 1931 uncontested win, the development of the other 1931 entrants continued. The proposed Italian entrant (the Macchi M.C.72), which had pulled out of the contest due to engine problems, later went on to set two new world speed records with the help of British fuel expert Rod Banks, who had worked on the Rolls Royce R engine of the S6B. In April 1933 it set a record over Lake Garda in northern Italy with a speed of . Eighteen months later in the same venue, it broke the 700\u00a0km/h barrier with an average speed of . Both times the plane was piloted by Francesco Agello. This speed remains the fastest speed ever attained by a piston-engined seaplane.\nFor a complete list of the aircraft which competed in the competitions, see List of Schneider Trophy aircraft.\n1981 revival.\nIn 1981 the race was revived, no longer for seaplanes and under different rules, by the Royal Aero Club of Great Britain to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Britain's ultimate retention of the Schneider Trophy. The original trophy remained in the Science Museum, a full-size replica was cast, and the race opened on a handicapped basis to any propeller\u2013driven landplane capable of maintaining in straight and level flight, and weighing up to . Pilots had to have a minimum of 100 hours as pilot-in-command, and a valid air racing licence.\nFollowing that event, the UK subsidiary of U.S. computer company Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) independently decided to sponsor a long-term revival of the Schneider Trophy, with the first race held in 1984, and races held annually, with a few omissions, since then. The idea was submitted by DEC's then UK PR consultancy Infopress as part of a broader commercial sponsorship programme designed to increase DEC's presence in the UK market at that time. DEC sponsored this revived race series from 1984 until 1991, which also marked the diamond jubilee of the final race in the original series. DEC and Infopress turned to the expertise of the Royal Aero Club's Records, Racing &amp; Rally Association which again administered and ran the actual races. The 1981 Solent course, itself a close approximation of the original 1929 and 1931 Schneider Trophy courses over the Solent, was also used and adapted from year to year.\nThis sponsorship had a profound effect on the awareness and popularity of handicapped air racing in the UK and further afield, as well as markedly increasing DEC's commercial profile in the UK. The appeal of the race, its historic connections, and the fact that prize money was now on offer, meant that the entry list for the race was large enough to warrant the introduction of heats from 1985 onwards. (There were 62 entrants to the 1984 race, believed at the time to be the largest-ever in all forms of air racing.)\nThe event received further boosts in 1986, when it was started by the then Prince Andrew, Duke of York (later Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor) and his fianc\u00e9e Sarah Ferguson; in 1987, when the event was featured as one episode in a BBC television documentary series; and in 1988, when it was a central part of that year's ITV Telethon Appeal.\nDEC invited customers and partners to each year's event as guests, and the general public watched in increasing numbers as the series grew in size and popularity.\nFor the pilots taking part, the event became, along with the King's Cup air race, the highlight of the UK's air racing season, and regularly attracted entrants from continental Europe.\nDEC continued to sponsor the races until 1991. Since that time, the race has been run by the Royal Aero Club Records Racing and Rally Association along with the King's Cup and the British air racing championship. The venue has varied but is still flown on most occasions around a Solent-based course, usually around September of each year.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He produced the world's first slimline electronic pocket calculator (the Sinclair Executive) in 1972. Sinclair then moved into the production of home computers in 1980 with Sinclair Research Ltd, producing the Sinclair ZX80 (the UK's first mass-market home computer for less than \u00a3100) and in the early 1980s, the ZX81, ZX Spectrum and the Sinclair QL. Sinclair Research is widely recognised for its importance in the early days of the British and European home computer industry, as well as helping to give rise to the British video game industry.\nSinclair also had several commercial failures, including the Sinclair Radionics Black Watch wristwatch, the Sinclair Vehicles C5 battery electric vehicle, and the Sinclair Research TV80 flatscreen CRT handheld television set. The failure of the C5, along with a weakened computer market, forced Sinclair to sell most of his companies by 1986. Through 2010, Sinclair concentrated on personal transport, including the A-bike, a folding bicycle for commuters which was small enough to fit in a handbag. He also developed the Sinclair X-1, a revised version of the C5 electric vehicle, which never made it to the market.\nSinclair was appointed Knight Bachelor in the 1983 Birthday Honours for his contributions to the personal computer industry in the UK.\nEarly life, family and education.\nSinclair's father and grandfather were engineers; both had been apprentices at the shipbuilders Vickers. His grandfather George Sinclair was a naval architect who got the \"paravane\", a mine sweeping device, to work. George Sinclair's son, George William \"Bill\" Sinclair, wanted to take religious orders or become a journalist. His father suggested he train as an engineer first; Bill became a mechanical engineer and remained in the field. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he was running his own machine tools business in London, and later worked for the Ministry of Supply.\nClive Sinclair was born to George Sinclair and Thora Edith Ella Marles on 30 July 1940, in Ealing, Middlesex. He and his mother left London for safety to stay with an aunt in Devon, where they eventually moved to Teignmouth. A telegram arrived shortly afterwards, bringing the news that their home in Ealing had been bombed. Sinclair's father found a house in Bracknell in Berkshire. His brother Iain was born in 1943 and his sister Fiona in 1947.\nSinclair attended Boxgrove Preparatory School, excelling in mathematics. Sinclair had little interest in sports and found himself out of place at school. By the time he was ten, his father had financial problems. He had branched out from machine tools and planned to import miniature tractors from the U.S.; he had to give up the business. Because of his father's problems, Sinclair had to move school several times. After a time at Reading School, Sinclair took his O-levels at Highgate School in London in 1955, and his A-levels and S-levels in physics, pure maths, and applied maths at St. George's College, Weybridge.\nDuring his early years, Sinclair earned money mowing lawns and washing up in a caf\u00e9, earning 6d (2\u00bdp) more than the permanent staff. Later he went for holiday jobs at electronic companies. At Solartron he inquired about the possibility of electrically propelled personal vehicles. Sinclair applied for a holiday job at Mullard and took one of his circuit designs; he was rejected for precociousness. While still at school he wrote his first article for \"Practical Wireless\".\nAfter he left school at the age of 18, he sold miniature electronic kits by mail order to the hobby market.\nCareer.\nSinclair Radionics.\nSinclair's Micro Kit was formalised in an exercise book dated 19 June 1958, three weeks before his A-levels. Sinclair drew a radio circuit, Model Mark I, with a components list: cost per set 9/11 (49\u00bdp), plus coloured wire and solder, nuts and bolts, plus celluloid chassis (drilled) for nine shillings (45p). Also in the book are the advertisement rates for \"Radio Constructor\" at the time (9d (3\u00bep)/word, minimum 6/- (30p)) and \"Practical Wireless\" (5/6 (27\u00bdp) per line or part line). Sinclair estimated producing 1,000 a month, placing orders with suppliers for 10,000 of each component to be delivered.\nSinclair wrote a book for Bernard's Publishing, \"Practical transistor receivers Book 1\", which appeared in January 1959. It was re-printed late that year and nine times subsequently. His practical stereo handbook was published in June 1959 and reprinted seven times over 14 years. The last book Sinclair wrote as an employee of Bernard's was \"Modern Transistor Circuits for Beginners\", published in May 1962. At Bernard Babani, he wrote 13 constructor books.\nIn 1961, Sinclair registered Sinclair Radionics Ltd. His original choice, \"Sinclair Electronics\", had been taken; \"Sinclair Radio\" was available but did not sound right. Sinclair Radionics was formed on 25 July 1961. Sinclair made two attempts to raise startup capital to advertise his inventions and buy components. He designed PCB kits and licensed some technology. Then he took his design for a miniature transistor pocket radio and sought a backer for its production in kit form. Eventually he found someone who agreed to buy 55% of his company for \u00a33,000, but the deal didn't finalise.\nSinclair, unable to find capital, joined United Trade Press (UTP) as technical editor of \"Instrument Practice\". Sinclair appeared in the publication as an assistant editor in March 1962. Sinclair described making silicon planar transistors, their properties and applications and hoped they might be available by the end of 1962. Sinclair undertook a survey of semiconductor devices for \"Instrument Practice\", which appeared in four sections between September 1962 and January 1963.\nHis last appearance as assistant editor was in April 1969. Through UTP, Sinclair had access to thousands of devices from 36 manufacturers. He contacted Semiconductors Ltd (who at that time sold semiconductors made by Plessey) and ordered rejects to repair. He produced a design for a miniature radio powered by a couple of hearing aid cells and made a deal with Semiconductors to buy its micro-alloy transistors at 6d (2\u00bdp) each in boxes of 10,000. He then carried out his own quality control tests, and marketed his renamed MAT 100 and 120 at 7s 9d (38\u00bep) and 101 and 121 at 8s 6d (42\u00bdp).\nBy the late 1960s and early 1970s, Sinclair Radionics was producing handheld electronic calculators, miniature televisions, and the digital Black Watch wristwatch. The latter product, introduced in 1975, was a significant failure for Sinclair: in addition to being unable to meet demand, the watch itself was found to be inaccurate and difficult to service, and its battery life was too short. Sinclair Radionics suffered its first financial loss in 1975\u20131976, and Sinclair sought potential investors to help recover the lost funds. He eventually worked with the National Enterprise Board (NEB), which bought a 43% interest in the company in 1976, but this injection of funds was found to be too late as by this point, other companies were starting to make similar products at lower costs on the market. The NEB streamlined Sinclair Radionics' product line, selling off the watch and television lines, and brought in Norman Hewitt as a managing director to assist Sinclair. While Sinclair made efforts to work with Hewitt and the NEB, his relationship with these worsened, as the NEB had little faith in Sinclair's vision. \nBy 1979, the NEB opted to break up Sinclair Radionics, holding its instruments division as Sinclair Electronics, and selling its television division to Binatone and its calculator division to ESL Bristol. Sinclair himself left the company at this point. Effectively NEB wrote off its estimated \u00a37 million investment into Sinclair Radionics as a loss. Sinclair was given a golden handshake and an estimated \u00a310,000 package with the dissolution of his company.\nSinclair Research.\nWhile Sinclair was dealing with the NEB and had seen problems developing, he had a former employee, Christopher Curry, establish a \"lifeboat\" company, called Science of Cambridge Ltd, in July 1977, called such as they were located near University of Cambridge, and planned for Curry to develop technology from ideas from the school. An early product from Science of Cambridge was a wrist calculator kit, which helped to keep the company financially afloat.\nBy the time that Sinclair had left Radionics and joined Curry at Science of Cambridge, inexpensive microprocessors had started appearing on the market. Sinclair came up with the idea of selling a microprocessor teaching kit, and in June 1978, Science of Cambridge launched the MK14 kit, based on the National SC/MP chip, in June 1978. As Sinclair began working on the MK14's successor, Curry was in discussions with Hermann Hauser, and opted to leave Science of Cambridge to co-found Acorn Computers with Hauser in 1978. Acorn became a direct competitor to Sinclair's products, with the Acorn System 75 as its answer to the MK14, effectively an MK14 chip with a keyboard.\nTo follow up on the MK14, Sinclair started looking to build a personal computer. At around that time (1979), premade systems such as the Commodore PET cost about \u00a3700, and Sinclair believed he could get the price of a system to under \u00a3100. Keeping the cost low was also essential for Sinclair to avoid his products from becoming outpriced by American or Japanese equivalents as had happened to several of the Sinclair Radionics products. In May 1979, Jim Westwood, a former Sinclair Radionics employee Sinclair hired for this new company, started the ZX80 project at Science of Cambridge; it was launched in February 1980 at \u00a379.95 in kit form and \u00a399.95 ready-built. The ZX80 was immediately successful, and besides sales in the UK, Sinclair also sought to introduce the computer into the United States. Science of Cambridge was subsequently renamed Sinclair Computers Ltd, and then again to Sinclair Research Ltd.\nOn hearing that the BBC was preparing to run a television series to teach viewers about computing and programming, both Sinclair and Curry pressured the BBC to choose computers from their respective companies to use as the primary tool. This pushed the development of the Sinclair ZX81 ahead as Sinclair's standard for the BBC. The ZX81 was launched at \u00a349.95 in kit form and \u00a369.95 ready-built, by mail order. Ultimately, the BBC chose Acorn and standardized on a successor to the Acorn Atom\u2014originally named Acorn Proton, but ultimately branded as the BBC Micro. Despite losing out to the BBC, Sinclair's push had established the ZX80 and ZX81 as one of the most-sold brands of computers across the UK and the United States as well as establishing a deal with distribution in Japan with Mitsui. A number of user groups, magazines and third party accessories for both computers started to appear.\nIn February 1982, Timex obtained a licence to manufacture and market Sinclair's computers in the United States under the name Timex Sinclair. In April, the ZX Spectrum was launched at \u00a3125 for the 16 kB RAM version and \u00a3175 for the 48 kB version. It was the first computer in the ZX line to support colour output. The ZX Spectrum remained more affordable than other computers on the market, including the BBC Micro, VIC-20, and Apple II, and during a time of recession and high unemployment in the UK, was positioned by Sinclair as a low-cost home computer for productivity applications. However, it also proved to be a popular gift for teenagers and young adults that year. This led to a number of these young people learning to program on the ZX Spectrum, using its newfound colour support, to make quirky video games inspired by British humour which they sold through word of mouth and mail order. So-called \"bedroom coders\" using the ZX Spectrum gave rise to the start of the UK's video game industry. By 1984, over 3,500 games had been released for the ZX Spectrum.\nThe popularity of the ZX Spectrum spread to Western Europe. While Sinclair could not export into Eastern European countries still within the Soviet bloc at the time, numerous low-cost clones of the ZX Spectrum sprang up within these countries, further boosting the start of video game development by similar bedroom coders. The ZX Spectrum went on to become the UK's most-sold computer, selling more than 5 million units before it was discontinued in 1992. Sinclair Research computers accounted for 45% of the British market in 1984, including those from British and American companies.\nThe continued success of the computer market continued to help boost Sinclair Research's profit. In 1982, the company had a pre-tax profit of \u00a39.2 million on a turnover of \u00a327.6 million. Sinclair himself was estimated to a net value of over \u00a3100 million in 1983, two years after launching the first of the ZX computers. With the additional funds, Sinclair converted the Barker &amp; Wadsworth mineral water bottling factory into the company's headquarters in 1982. In January 1983, American news magazine \"Time\" named the personal computer the 1982 \"Machine of the Year,\" and Sinclair was one of six individuals from the computing industry who were spotlighted in the accompanying feature.\nSinclair Vehicles and market decline.\nAs Sinclair Research continued to be successful, Sinclair launched a new company, Sinclair Vehicles Ltd., in March 1983 to develop electric vehicles, using 10% of the capital generated by Sinclair Research and selling some of his own shares to fund the new venture. Sinclair had an interest in electric vehicles since the 1970s at Sinclair Radionics, and had been working with Tony Wood Rogers, a former Radionics employee, since 1979 to start developing prototypes of a new vehicle for the market. The company's only product was the Sinclair C5 which launched in January 1985. \nThe Sinclair C5 was considered a significant failure, having been developed without any market research. It was widely criticised and widely ridiculed for its high price, its toy-like appearance, lack of safety features and exposure to the elements, and the need for the user to pedal the vehicle up steeper hills. Whilst Sinclair had anticipated 100,000 C5's would be sold in the first year, 14,000 units were produced and 4,500 sold before the C5 line was terminated in August that same year.\nAnother noted misfire for Sinclair was the Sinclair Research TV80, a flatscreen portable mini television utilising a cathode-ray tube, which took several years to develop, and by the time the TV80 was ready for market in 1983, the Sony Watchman had been released in Japan in 1982. Furthermore, LCD television technology was already in advanced development to bypass the limitations of CRT. The TV80 was considered a commercial flop, with 15,000 units being produced. Despite these commercial failures, both the C5 and TV80 have since been considered products ahead of their time, with the C5 a precursor to the modern day electric car and the TV80 comparable to watching videos on smartphones.\nSinclair continued to direct Sinclair Research as they continued the ZX Spectrum line of computers through 1983 and 1984 as well as launching the Sinclair QL (short for Quantum Leap) brand in 1984 intended to compete with business lines of computers from IBM and Apple but at about half their cost. However, towards the end of 1984, the market for personal computers in the United Kingdom became cautious; Sinclair Research had entered into a small price war with Acorn Computers. The price drops meant that consumers saw these computers as more toys rather than productivity tools, and Sinclair Research missed its planned sales milestones for the 1984 holiday season. Into 1985, Acorn fell under investigation which propagated solvency concerns throughout the computer industry, including Sinclair Research. Robert Maxwell, the owner of \"The Daily Mirror\" and \"Pergamon Press\", planned to help Sinclair Research through its \u00a312 million acquisition via Pergamon's Hollis Brothers division, announced in June 1985. However the deal was aborted in August 1985 as Sinclair found an offer with the Dixons Group of \u00a310 million.\nThe lack of funds for Sinclair Research and the failure of the C5 created financial difficulties for Sinclair. Sinclair Vehicles was placed into receivership by October 1985, and in April 1986, Sinclair sold the bulk of Sinclair Research to Amstrad for \u00a35 million. Sinclair Research Ltd. was reduced to an R&amp;D business and holding company, with shareholdings in several spin-off companies, formed to exploit technologies developed by the company. These included Anamartic Ltd. (wafer-scale integration) and Cambridge Computer Ltd. (Z88 portable computer and satellite television receivers).\nLater years.\nBy 1990, Sinclair Research consisted of Sinclair and two other employees down from 130 employees at its peak in 1985, and its activities later concentrated on personal transport, including the Zike electric bicycle. By 2003, Sinclair Research was collaborating with Hong Kong-based firm Daka. A laboratory was set up for Daka near Croydon to develop products on a royalty basis. The two firms collaborated on a Sea Scooter and a wheelchair drive. In 1997, he invented the Sinclair X1, which was a radio the size of a 10p coin.\nSinclair had planned to introduce the Sinclair X-1 through Sinclair Research, another attempt at a personal electric vehicle following the Sinclair C5. The X-1 was first announced in 2010, and incorporated design aspects that the C5 had been panned for, including an open egg-like shell for the rider with a more ergonomic seat, a more powerful motor and larger battery storage, and an effectively lower cost accounting for inflation than the C5. However, the X-1 failed to reach the market.\nRecognition.\nSinclair received several honours for his contributions towards helping establish the personal computer industry in the United Kingdom. In 1983, he was awarded Honorary Degrees of Doctor of Science by the University of Bath, Heriot-Watt University and University of Warwick. He was knighted in the Queen's 1983 Birthday Honours List. In 1984, he was honoured by Imperial College London by being made a fellow. In 1988, London's National Portrait Gallery purchased a portrait of Sinclair by photographer Simon Lewis for its permanent collection.\nPersonal life.\nSinclair was a poker player and appeared in the first three series of the \"Late Night Poker\" on Channel 4. He won the first series final of the \"Celebrity Poker Club\" spin-off. Sinclair was an atheist. He had an IQ of 159, and was a member of Mensa, and chairman from 1980 to 1997. He also participated in marathons including several New York City Marathons.\nDespite his involvement in computing, Sinclair did not use the Internet, stating that he does not like to have \"technical or mechanical things around me\" as it distracts from the process of invention. In 2010, he said that he did not use computers, and preferred using the telephone rather than email. In 2014, he predicted, \"Once you start to make machines that are rivalling and surpassing humans with intelligence, it's going to be very difficult for us to survive. It's just an inevitability.\"\nHis first marriage with Ann ended in divorce after twenty years around 1985 due to the pressure from the ongoing financial issues he had with his companies. From his marriage with Ann, he had three children. In 1988/89 Sinclair was briefly engaged to the future television presenter and author Bernadette Tynan, then 22 years old, whom he had met at a Mensa meeting. Tynan subsequently broke off the engagement. In 2010 Sinclair married Angie Bowness, a former dancer at a Stringfellows nightclub and who represented England for Miss Europe 1995. This second marriage lasted for seven years before also ending in divorce.\nOn 16 September 2021, Sinclair died in London following an illness related to cancer that he had for over a decade. He was 81 years old. Sinclair was remembered on his death for his contributions towards computing and video games by numerous people, including Elon Musk, Satya Nadella, the Oliver Twins, Debbie Bestwick, Charles Cecil, and David Braben. A \"Times\" leader following his death described Sinclair as a tenacious inventor whose career was a triumph of perseverance similar to that of many of Britain's greatest inventors, such as James Dyson and Alexander Graham Bell, 'who are a reminder that failure is an essential prelude to success'.\nPublications.\nSinclair authored electronics constructor books for Bernard Babani publishers:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is depicted as a world of murky swamps, steaming bayous, and jungles, resembling Earth during the Carboniferous period. Dagobah is 14,410 kilometers in diameter with an orbital period of 341 days. Dagobah's climate and atmosphere consists of two seasons: a dry season, where the uplands become too hot for most life forms to survive; and a wet season, consisting of violent lightning storms, dense fog, and long periods of torrential rainfall. The Tash were a sentient species native to Dagobah.\nThe Dagobah System lies within the Dagobah subsector of the Sluis sector, located in the Outer Rim Territories galactic quadrant region, 50,250 light-years from Coruscant. The sun was called Dagobah Prime. It is noted as being one of the purest places in the galaxy, incredibly strong in the living force, and being chosen by Jedi Yoda as the planet to go into exile on to mask his presence and avoid discovery by the Galactic Empire.\nDepiction.\nThe similarly mono-thematic \"swampy, fog-shrouded planet of Mimban\" appearing in the novel \"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\", published between the films \"Star Wars: A New Hope and\" The Empire Strikes Back, \"might have inspired the production design for Dagobah\".\nFilm.\nDagobah was originally featured in the 1980 film \"The Empire Strikes Back\". In its first appearance, the main protagonist of the film, Luke Skywalker, is attempting to land his X-wing starfighter on the planet and is met with a dense fog causing him to crash land in a small bayou. Shortly after his landing, the Jedi Master Yoda is introduced during his time in exile. Yoda reluctantly agrees to train Skywalker and during his training many aspects of the planet's environment are utilized. Moss-covered rocks are used for training in telekinesis, the undergrowth makes treks through the jungles more challenging, and vines hanging from tall trees are used as means to get across small bodies of water and other obstacles. Skywalker is shown to sense the strength of the Force in a particular cave on the planet which Yoda tells him to go into. Inside the cave, Skywalker is met with a mental challenge the dark side of the Force developed for him.\nThe planet is also seen briefly in \"Return of the Jedi\" to depict Yoda's death and is featured in a deleted scene from \"Revenge of the Sith\" showing Yoda's arrival on the planet. George Lucas reportedly said it was removed so the film would not have \"too many endings.\" The scene was released under the title \"Exile to Dagobah\" on the film's DVD.\nOther media.\n\"\" featured Dagobah in a sixth-season episode, in which Yoda traveled to the planet as part of his own training to gain immortality through the Force.\nIn the \"Star Wars\" expanded universe, Yoda confronted a Bpfasshi Dark Jedi on Dagobah, some years before the events in \"The Empire Strikes Back\", and the cave where the Dark Jedi died became strong in the dark side of the Force. \"Star Wars Tales\" later retconned this event to take place earlier, with another Jedi of Yoda's species named Minch replacing Yoda. Dagobah was also visited by the main characters of the \"Galaxy of Fear\" series, where it was home for a time to a tribe of cannibals. During the events of \", a team of Jedi Knights from the New Jedi Order visit Dagobah, to find the cave drained of its former menace.\nDagobah appears as a hub world in \". \nAfter the events of \"Return of the Jedi\", the New Republic founded a military base on one of the greatest mountains of the planet, named 'Mount Yoda' after the Jedi Master.\nDescription.\nLargely looked over by the Galactic Republic, Dagobah is the only habitable planet in the system of the same name within the Sluis sector. A cloudy and swampy world of dense foliage, countless living things of all sizes, including reptiles, amphibians, and swarming insects, fill its environs with a hum of constant noise. All of its creatures appear completely unintelligent. Larger life-forms occupy cave-like hollows formed by petrified forests. Carnivorous \"gnarltrees\" reproduce as spiderlike mobile creatures which eventually metamorphose into their rooted form. The planet is also noted for being strong with the Force.\nAnalysis.\nSeveral scholars have interpreted Dagobah as the station of initiation when applying Joseph Campbell's schema of the hero's journey, going back to ancient myths, to the character of Luke Skywalker: the hero retreats \"from society to a world of more primal symbols where he must conquer his own darkness and return to the social world with a new redemptive knowledge.\" Dagobah is described as \"like something out of a dream\" and corresponds to \"a spiritual plane\". This primordial and isolated place of power, which seems hostile to civilization - the technological R2-D2 \"is spat out unceremoniously\" - is \"a sanctuary of nature\" and \"creates a space, which like no other, influences the conception and development of the hero\". Leah Deyneka linked the teeming nature of Dagobah with the \"enchanted forest or sacred grove\" which \"figures frequently in fairy tales and myths; trees are believed to hold special powers and forests symbolize mastery and transformation.\" Miles Booy saw Dagobah as a \"richly constructed [...] semiotic environment\" which \"does not point towards prior films but to widely circulated discourses concerning human consciousness\". Its jungle and \"dark swamp infested by reptiles\" may be considered an image of the subconscious, with Yoda fulfilling the role of the analyst who \"raises to the surface\" what has been submerged.\nDan Catalano commented that Dagobah as \"an eerie location filled with strange wildlife and shrouded in as much mystery as fog\", removed from the technology-filled galaxy, is a fitting device to underline Yoda's status as a \"Wise Man archetype\" in the tradition of Merlin, who likewise can be found in places of \"wild nature\" in Arthurian myths.\nBooy commented that within \"Star Wars\" \"[n]o other environment attempts such imagery as Dagobah is constructed of\" and that \"Dagobah would also come to be the basis for [...] the notion that the film constitutes a form of mythology.\""}

The company is fully owned by the Swinkels family for seven generations. The head office is located in Lieshout.\nSwinkels Family Brewers is the second largest brewery company in the Netherlands after Heineken and one of the largest producers of malt in Europe. The business has a turnover of more than 1,113 million euros per year. The company is commercially active in more than 130 countries. Two-thirds of the turnover is achieved in Europe. The focus is in Western Europe with more than half of the turnover. Outside of the European market, the largest contribution comes from the Middle East/Africa region, where a total of twenty percent of turnover is achieved.\nProducts.\nRoyal Swinkels produces and markets beer, malt and soft drinks.\nBeer.\nThe business operates nine brewery locations: three in the Netherlands, three in Belgium, one in Ethiopia, one in Cuba and one in Georgia. These breweries produced nearly 7 million hectolitres of beer in 2024. The group sells beer under several brand names, including Bavaria, Swinckels', La Trappe and Rodenbach.\nAlmost 11 percent of the total beer production consists of alcohol-free and low-alcoholic beer (less than 3.5%).\nMalt.\nSwinkels Family Brewers owns two malt houses, one in Lieshout and one in Eemshaven. The annual capacity totals 400,000 tons of malt, a third of which is used by Swinkels Family Brewers itself. One third of the production is sold to third parties in Europe and one third goes to countries outside Europe, mainly to Latin America, South America and Japan. Sales of malt contribute to around fifteen percent of Swinkels Family Brewers sales.\nSoft drinks.\nThe company produces approximately 600,000 hectoliters of soft drinks per annum, of which almost 95 percent as private label products. Swinkels Family Brewers itself uses the brand names 3ES and B52. Negus, a non-alcoholic, coffee-flavoured malt drink is brewed in Ethiopia.\nHistory.\nLocal brewery.\nThe history of Swinkels Family Brewers can be traced back to 1680. In that year Dirk Vereijken owned a brewery at the Kerkdijk (Church Dike Road) in Lieshout, proof of which can be found in an account of the municipal tax records of that year. This brewery was transferred from father to daughter for three consecutive generations. The names of the new brewing families were Van Moorsel and Moorrees. In 1764 Brigitta Moorrees married Ambrosius Swinkels. After her mother's death in 1773, Brigitta and her husband became the full owners of the brewery. Since then, the brewery has been owned by the Swinkels family.\nRegional brewery.\nFor centuries the brewery only produced beer for the local market. It was not until the fourth generation of Swinkels took charge of the brewery that production was expanded. Jan Swinkels, born in 1851, started distribution to the city of Helmond at from Lieshout in 1890. Sales rose from 988 hectolitres of beer in 1890 to 1,900 hectolitres in 1900. After the First World War distribution was expanded to other towns and villages in North Brabant. By 1923 output had increased to 3,325 hectolitres of beer. By that time the original brewery buildings had become too small so a larger brewery was built in Lieshout. On that occasion three brothers of the fifth generation of Swinkels took over leadership, and adopted the brand name \"Bavaria\". This name indicated that the new plant was a bottom fermentation brewery, producing pale lager (Bavarian) beer.\nNationwide distribution.\nDistribution was broadened to include Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht, the four largest cities of the Netherlands. In 1933 the brewery added its own bottling plant, which produced 2,000 bottles an hour. By 1940 a malt house was built. The output of the brewery at the beginning of the Second World War was approximately 40,000 helicopters per annum, with an almost nationwide coverage in distribution.\nIn 1955 the company started manufacturing soft drinks under the brand name 3-ES. This name refers to the three Swinkels brothers of the fifth generation. In the postwar years beer consumption in the Netherlands had decreased to a very low level. It took the firm until 1959 to recover in terms of sales volume. In the sixties the company doubled its production capacity.\nWorld player.\nFrom 1973 onwards the company took an interest in the exporting business, first of all in Southern Europe. In the late seventies the firm introduced alcohol-free beer, that was exported to Islamic countries. By 1981 the total volume reached 1,000,000 hectolitres of beer. From the nineties onwards the business expanded into exclusive and seasonal beers. Moreover, the company started to adapt its drinks to individual markets. Consequently, export grew to cover 130 countries.\nIn 1999, the Trappist Koningshoeven Abbey, located in Berkel-Enschot, entered into an agreement with the Swinkels family to take over the daily operations of the monks' brewery within the abbey. The brewery, which operates as \"De Koningshoeven NV\", is a subsidiary of Swinkels Family Brewers, whilst the buildings and equipment remain in the ownership of the abbey. The monks remain the ultimate authority on the brewing process while Swinkels Family Brewers manages the commercial business. The beer is sold under the brandname La Trappe.\nOn 10 May 2016 it was announced that the company has taken a majority stake in the Belgian brewery Palm. Initially the firm acquired 60% of the shares and this was expanded to 100% in 2021.\nIn November 2016 the company acquired Latis Imports, establishing a dedicated US presence in one of its \"five key regions\".\nIn June 2018 it was decided to change the name of \"Bavaria\" to \"Swinkels Family Brewers\". In March 2019, Wim van de Donk, Commissioner of the King of the province of Brabant, announced that Swinkels Family Brewers would from now on have the Royal predicate, officially naming the company 'Royal Swinkels Family Brewers'. It has been gained for the 300th anniversary of the company and their national significance. As from 2024 the name was shortened to Royal Swinkels.\nPrice fixing conviction.\nOn 18 April 2007 the European Commission imposed punitive fines on three major European breweries for operating a price fixing cartel in the Netherlands. The three were Heineken (\u20ac219.3m), Grolsch (\u20ac31.65m) and Swinkels Family Brewers (\u20ac22.85m). A fourth participant in the cartel, InBev (formerly Interbrew), did not receive a penalty because it provided \"decisive information\" about the cartel's operations between 1996 and 1999, as well as about others in the European Union. These four brewers had control of 95% of the Dutch market, with Heineken claiming a half and the three others 15% each.\nEU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said she was \"very disappointed\" that the collusion took place at the very highest (boardroom) level. She stated, \"This is simply unacceptable: that major beer suppliers colluded to up prices and to carve up markets among themselves. She added, \"Heineken, Grolsch, Bavaria and InBev tried to cover their tracks by using code names and abbreviations for secret meetings to carve up the market for beer sold to supermarkets, hotels, restaurants and cafes. The price fixing extended to cheaper own-brand labels and rebates for bars.\nWorld Cup Ambush Marketing campaigns.\nAt the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Swinkels Family Brewers got up to 1,000 fans of the Netherlands national football team to don orange overalls, called Leeuwenhosen, with the brewery's logo on them. The Leeuwenhosen were given away with the purchase of Swinkels Family Brewers products prior to the World Cup. However the action was deemed to be an act of ambush marketing by FIFA as Swinkels Family Brewers, which was not a corporate sponsor, had not paid any money to be an official event partner. With pre-warning from FIFA officials, staff at the game versus Ivory Coast asked fans to remove the overalls upon entrance to the game and provided orange replacement shorts without any logo.\nDuring the 2010 FIFA World Cup, 36 women clad in orange miniskirts went to the Netherlands vs Denmark match in Johannesburg, using tickets supplied at least in part by British ITV pundit and ex-footballer Robbie Earle. Tournament officials evicted the group en masse from the stadium upon which they were arrested and held by the Police. They were released upon talks between the management of Swinkels Family Brewers and FIFA.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The eye is formed in the end of the rope to permit attachments/connections. It is quite common in Russia and is often used instead of the bowline (ABoK #1010). In the simple bowline, the collar component forms around the 'standing part'. In contrast, the collar component of an Eskimo bowline forms around the outgoing eye-leg.\nOn the first of arctic explorer John Ross' expeditions (1818) the Inuit (Eskimos) presented him a sled that contained several of these knots, showing that it is a genuine Inuit knot.\nThe knot is not mentioned in \"The Ashley Book of Knots\" but in its Russian equivalent, the book \"\u041c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u0437\u043b\u044b\"\n(Marine Knots) by (1930\u20132000). The knot is referred to in the Russian book as the Cossack knot, and its slipped version is known as the Kalmyk loop.\nThe Eskimo bowline is about as strong as and even more secure than the bowline, especially in synthetic lines.\nUnder cross load (ring loading, transverse loading profile), i.e. when the loop is pulled apart, the shown common Eskimo loop effectively mimics an ends-opposite (and inferior) left-hand sheet bend and thus can slip like the bowline; the less common Eskimo loop variant with the A\u2013C loop (see bowline family diagram) would give a proper same-side sheet bend, thus being much stronger under cross load. Similarly, when the eye of a simple bowline is subject to a transverse loading profile, it mimics the inferior version of the Lapp bend, and so can slip and untie; the wrongly demeaned left-handed or cowboy bowline becomes the proper Lapp bend, and should hold..\nAll of the maneuvers to tie this knot are generally in the opposite (or 'anti' direction) relative to the bowline. After forming the 'nipping loop' with C &amp; D (which can be formed as 'S' or 'Z' chirality) the working end is fed through that loop from the same side A as the outgoing eye leg C. This is opposite (or 'anti') direction relative to the simple (ABOK #1010) Bowline (A\u2013D on opposite sides).\nThe so called 'Eskimo' Bowline has also been known as \"Boas Bowline\" and \"Cossack knot\" - all of these names referring to the same structure. The Kalmyk loop can be made 'TIB' (Tiable In the Bight); however, it will not be 'EEL' (Either End Loadable).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are introduced in the fifth and last arc of the series, called \"Stars\" in the manga, \"Sailor Moon Sailor Stars\" in the original anime adaptation, and \"Sailor Moon Cosmos\" in the second anime adaptation. The Starlights debut in chapter #43 \"Stars 1\", originally published in Japan's \"Nakayoshi\" magazine on March 28, 1996.\nThe group itself is composed of Sailor Star Fighter, Sailor Star Maker, and Sailor Star Healer; when in civilian form they go by the pseudonyms Kou Seiya, Kou Taiki, and Kou Yaten respectively. They are from the fictional planet Kinmoku, which has been destroyed, and disguise themselves as male idols, , in order to hide their true identities as they search for their lost princess, Kakyuu.\nProfiles.\nThe Starlights come from Kinmoku, a planet from another star system whose ruler, Princess Kakyuu, left to escape Sailor Galaxia's assault and heal her wounds. They tracked Kakyuu to Earth and then Japan, where they disguised themselves as the male pop star group The Three Lights and embedded their music with a telepathic broadcast to attract her attention. They attend J\u016bban High School along with Usagi Tsukino and her friends. Eventually, they manage to reunite with Kakyuu; however, while headed to the Galaxy Cauldron, Galaxia's henchwomen Sailor Chi and Sailor Phi kill them. \nIn the original anime adaptation, the Starlights were given a major role. On Earth, they physically change into males in their civilian forms and become women again when transforming into Sailor Guardians, as opposed to their manga counterparts, who disguise themselves as men as civilians. As Starlights, they distance themselves from the other Sailor Guardians, deeming that Earth is not their responsibility. They survive several direct battles with Galaxia herself, and help Sailor Moon defeat Chaos to save Galaxia. \nThe Starlights are featured in several of the \"Sailor Moon\" musicals (\"Sailor Stars\", \"Eien Densetsu\", and their revised editions, as well as \"Ryuusei Densetsu\", \"Kakyuu-Ouhi Kourin\" and Le Mouvement Final). Despite being portrayed by women, it is meant to be ambiguous as to whether they take on male forms or cross-dress, though their personalities reflect the former. Their story also combines elements from both the manga and the anime; for instance, they travel to the Galaxy Cauldron as in the manga, but survive the battles against Galaxia as in the anime. The pairings with the Sailor Guardians from the anime are also featured in some musicals.\nSailor Star Fighter.\n, also known as , is the lead vocalist of the Three Lights. In general, Seiya acts arrogant and tends to be, at least on the surface, confident in her own abilities.\nSeiya becomes the star player of their local high-school American football team and the school's star athlete, upsetting Haruka Tenoh, who was the previous star athlete on the track and field team. Eventually, Seiya raises the suspicions of the Sailor Guardians as to her identity. In the anime, Taiki and Yaten consider her to be prone to bouts of childishness, such as when she shows off he basketball skills before the school, but generally follow her lead.\nSeiya develops strong feelings for Usagi, calling her \"odango\", like Mamoru does, with Seiya's attempts to forge a bond with her providing the primary romantic tension of the season. The two go on a date at an amusement park, which is interrupted when Sailor Iron Mouse attacks. Seiya makes her interest in Usagi clear when they spend time together practicing softball, telling her, \"I like your light.\" However, her feelings are not reciprocated and she acknowledges the one-sided romance.\nThe relationship between Sailor Star Fighter and Princess Kakyuu is slightly ambiguous. In the anime, when Seiya daydreams of the Starlights' home planet, she think of an image of Kakyuu, which is suddenly superimposed by an image of Usagi, much as Usagi had seen Seiya's image overlaid by Mamoru in previous episodes. In the image poem released for her CD single, however, she suggests that her feelings for Usagi are because she is \"carrying the heart of a boy\" and because she was attracted to Usagi's light.\nIn the band, she has the role of lead vocals, guitar and lyrics, but was also shown also playing the drums in the Starlights' hideout because she believed Kakyuu had not heard her yet. According to Takeuchi, when she created her, she was meant to be a combination between Haruka and Mamoru, and was modeled after Jenny Shimizu. Her theme color is cyan.\nIn Japanese, she was voiced by Shiho Niiyama in the original series in one of her final roles before her death and by Marina Inoue in \"Sailor Moon Cosmos\". In English, she is voiced by Melissa Hutchison in the Viz dub. In the musicals, Seiya has been portrayed by Sayuri Katayama, Chinatsu Akiyama and Meiku Harukawa.\nSailor Star Maker.\n, also known as , is the most intellectual and cool-headed of the trio. Her abilities rival that of Ami, though she considers Ami's romantic notions foolish. However, in the anime, Ami's appeal for her to see the good in dreaming does begin to have an effect. In combat with a phage, Star Maker is the first of the Starlights to willingly allow Sailor Moon to heal the monster rather than trying to kill it herself, because it had been a teacher who Ami respected. Later in the series, as she is beginning to lose hope in finding Princess Kakyuu, she visits a sick girl named Misa in the hospital. She shows Taiki a drawing of the Princess that she sees when she listens to the Three Lights' song, giving Taiki renewed hope.\nLike Yaten, Taiki believes that Seiya should stay away from Usagi after learning she is Sailor Moon, despite her wish, shared by Princess Kakyuu and the Sailor Guardians, for them to work together. However, her views on Usagi change for the better near the end of \"Sailor Stars\".\nIn the band, she has the role of background vocals, keyboards and composition. She also enjoys poetry and are part of the literature club at school. Taiki is meant to be a more-distant Setsuna Meioh. Her theme color is violet.\nIn Japanese, Taiki is voiced by Narumi Tsunoda in the original series and by Saori Hayami in \"Cosmos\". In English, she is voiced by Erika Harlacher in the Viz dub. In the musicals, Taiki has been portrayed by Hikari Ono, Akiko Nakayama and Riona Tatemichi.\nSailor Star Healer.\n, also known as , is a lonely person who does not like to socialize or interact with others, preferring to focus on her mission. Her remarks are often sharp-edged and blunt, which further separates her from others, which the other Starlights mock her for as it may reduce her fanbase. Yaten is egotistical and nurses grudges, and hates injury. However, she and Luna get along well.\nYaten has the most spiritual awareness of the three and is able to tell when Star Seeds are taken by Galaxia. She views humans as untrustworthy and want to find Kakyuu so the group can leave Earth as soon as possible. After learning that Usagi is Sailor Moon, Yaten believes that Seiya should stay away from her, despite her wish, shared by Princess Kakyuu and the Sailor Guardians, for them to work together, a view shared by Taiki and Sailors Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. However, like Taiki, her views on Usagi change for the better near the end of \"Sailor Stars\". In the anime, Yaten is shown to be physically stronger than Makoto Kino in her civilian form, and bonds with her as they share moments together.\nIn the band, she has the role of background vocals, bass guitar and song arrangement. She also enjoys photography, but does not belong to any school club, preferring to just go home. Her theme color is lime green.\nIn Japanese, Yaten is voiced by Chika Sakamoto in the original series and by Ayane Sakura in \"Cosmos.\" In English, she is voiced by Sarah Anne Williams in the Viz dub. In the musicals, Yaten has been portrayed by Momoko Okuyama, Mikako Tabe and Saki Matsuda.\nSpecial powers and items.\nThe Sailor Starlights share some traits with the Solar System Guardians, having transformation devices to change from civilians into their Sailor Guardian forms, as well as having signature attacks \u2014 although they do not represent proper elements like the Solar System Guardians do. Each member of the Three Lights use their own Sailor Change Star, which is a two-piece set of microphone and brooch, and respectively shout the phrase \"Fighter/Maker/Healer Star Power, Make-Up!\" to transform into Sailors Star Fighter, Star Maker, and Star Healer. Takeuchi explained in her own notes that the brooches contain their Sailor Crystals, which are perhaps their most important possessions, as they are source of all their powers. The original anime adaptation clearly shows how the Three Lights change from male bodies into female ones when transforming. Unlike most of the Sailor Guardians, whose transformation sequences went mostly unchanged from the first to the second anime adaptation, the Starlights' were completely altered to reflect the fact that the Three Lights remain female in their civilian forms, since \"Sailor Moon Cosmos\" follows the \"Stars\" arc of the manga closer than the \"Sailor Moon Sailor Stars\" season of the original anime.\nIn the original anime adaptation, each of the Starlights use an item called Star Yell (sometimes called the Sailor Star Yell), which are palm sized star-shaped devices, to launch their attacks. Star Fighter's attack is \"Star Serious Laser\" \u2014 a focused light blast. Star Maker's attack is \"Star Gentle Uterus\" \u2014 an explosion of lights. Star Healer's attack is \"Star Sensitive Inferno\" \u2014 a circular blast of lightning. The only time the three Starlights combine their attacks occurs in the penultimate episode of the original anime adaptation, in which they join forces to launch a single attack on Sailor Galaxia, managing to physically hurt her. In the musical \"Eien Densetsu\", this attack is named \"Starlights Fusion Tempest\", which is similar in name to Kakyuu's own \"Kinmoku Fusion Tempest\".\nDevelopment.\nSeries creator Naoko Takeuchi originally designed the trio without their ponytails, but the ponytails were added after it was explained to her that short-haired dolls were difficult to make. Takeuichi designed a unified outfit for the three of them, using a set of navy blue breastplate, hot pants, and high heeled thigh-high boots. Only their necklaces, belts, and protector bracelets have different colors, which match their respective eye color: sky blue for Star Fighter, violet for Star Maker, and chartreuse for Star Healer. Takeuchi listed several attacks for each of the Starlights; however, only those she described as \"main attacks\" are featured in the series. \nTakeuchi expressed surprise at Toei Animation's decision to make the Starlights lead characters in the original anime adaptation, but was even more shocked by their treatment of their sex. Rather than merely being females disguising as male pop idols as they do in the manga and other adaptations, the Three Lights were designed as physically male in the original anime adaptation, which contradicts Takeuchi's statement that only girls can be Sailor Guardians.\nTheir exact relationship to each other is unknown; according to the manga, they are not siblings. Their name \"Kou\" (\u5149) has several meanings, including \"light\", making the name \"Three Lights\" a pun. In the original English manga, \"Kou\" was translated to \"Lights\" and was used as their shared family name.\nReception and influence.\nAccording to Catherine E. Bailey of the Western Michigan University, when the Solar System Guardians learn the true identity of the Three Lights, \"the collapse of the Lights' dual identities has more to do with social roles than sexual or gender identity. The fact that their secret is not met with disgust, disdain, or any other negative judgment indicates that \"Sailor Moon\" may have the potential to help normalise and un-sensationalise the presence of transgender and transsexual individuals.\" The author further explained she was hesitant to label the Starlights are \"transgender\" or \"transsexual\", although she acknowledges the anime \"encourages viewers to look past the characters' physical bodies and to contemplate the fact that they are the same individuals regardless of the bodies that they occupy.\" In an article for the \"Interalia Journal of Queer Studies\", Rhea Ashley Hoskin of the University of Waterloo explained that the Starlights' transformation sequences make them \"weave between dichotomized boundaries of sex, gender and sexuality, essentially positioning these characters against notions of stable identity.\" \nMadeline Hurren from \"Medium\" noted that, while the Starlights \"clearly transform between male and female\", other characters do not question this representation of diverse representation. The author also compared \"Sailor Moon\" to newer manga and anime, stating that \"the show treats the nuances of gender identity and sexuality simply as one aspect of a multi-dimensional character. This, however, has changed. Modern anime increasingly treats non-binary identities as the sole focus of a character.\" Austin Jones from \"Paste\" described the trio as \"genderfluid characters, given their distance from Western ideas of gender presentation as well as their unique ability.\" Diane Darcy from \"CBR\" considered that, in the original anime adaptation, \"along with being able to transition between male and female bodies, all three Sailor Starlights also behave like boys in their civilian identities and like girls in their Sailor Guardian identities\" thus becoming \"an excellent trans and non-binary representation.\" \nIn a review of \"Sailor Moon Cosmos\", Darcy from \"CBR\" noted the difference in the portrayal of the Starlights, this time female in both Sailor Guardian and civilian forms, explaining that \"by giving all three Sailor Starlights deeper voices, the characters' gender fluidity is more strongly conveyed and allows them to more convincingly pass for the male members of the boy band, Three Lights\" while also praising the fact that \"the Sailor Starlights' new voice actors do not aim to replicate the iconic performances\" of the voice cast members of the original anime adaptation. Rebecca Silverman from \"Anime News Network\" described the new transformation sequences of the Starlights in \"Cosmos\" as \"very awkward\".\nCensorship.\nThe \"Sailor Stars\" season of the original anime adaptation was not dubbed into English by DIC Entertainment and Cloverway Inc. Rodriguez-Garcia from the \"The Michigan Daily\" explained that licensing issues were the main reason behind this event. However, other authors cite more reasons, the Starlights and their transformations being amongst them. Jamilya Ramos-Chapman from \"Syndicated Magazine\" stated that, in previous seasons, efforts were made to censor the sexuality of Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune, and Fish Eye, to make these characters fit into heteronormative narratives. Yet, this was not possible with the storyline of \"Sailor Stars\", so DiC and Cloverway decided not to air the season, because of \"the introduction of the Sailor Starlights, three male pop idols who could magically transform into otherworldly female warriors.\" Caroline Madden from \"/Film\" explained that, while DiC and Cloverway were able to censor the true identities of characters such as Zoisite and Fish Eye by \"casting cis women to voice these long-haired characters\" and thus \"let them pass as cisgender and heterosexual\", it would have been impossible to avoid with the Starlights' non-conforming identity. According to an article in \"Bookmans\", there was \"no way to edit out the strong transgender/transexual themes that involve the three new characters, the Sailor Star Lights\". The article also mentioned the complications derived from the relationship between Seiya and Usagi, and how \"even after she discovers the truth later on, she is not phased by the fact that \u201cFighter\u201d is female.\" Vargas and Younkin from \"CBR\" stated that one of the reasons behind the decision not to air the final season was because \"it would have been almost impossible to censor the Sailor Starlights in the way that they had with previous queer characters in the series.\" \nIn the Italian dub, instead of changing sex, the team has six members, as the Three Lights summon their twin sisters instead of transforming, as the original depiction was very controversial in Italy. Jones considered this decision \"completely ridiculous and only draws attention to the inherent queerness hiding in the series.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It concerns the benefits derived from using the land, and also the land management actions that humans carry out there. The following categories are used for land use: forest land, cropland (agricultural land), grassland, wetlands, settlements and other lands. The way humans use land, and how land use is changing, has many impacts on the environment. Effects of land use choices and changes by humans include, for example, urban sprawl, soil erosion, soil degradation, land degradation and desertification. Land use and land management practices have a major impact on natural resources including water, soil, nutrients, plants and animals.\n\"Land use change\" is \"the change from one land-use category to another\". Land-use change, together with use of fossil fuels, are the major anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide, a dominant greenhouse gas. Human activity is the most significant cause of land cover change, and humans are also directly impacted by the environmental consequences of these changes. For example, deforestation (the systematic and permanent conversion of previously forested land for other uses) has historically been a primary facilitator of land use and land cover change.\nThe study of land change relies on the synthesis of a wide range of data and a diverse range of data collection methods. These include land cover monitoring and assessments, modeling risk and vulnerability, and land change modeling.\nDefinition and categories.\nThe IPCC defines the term \"land use\" as the \"total of arrangements, activities and inputs applied to a parcel of land\". The same report groups \"land use\" into the following categories: forest land, cropland (agricultural land), grassland, wetlands, settlements and \"other lands\". \nAnother definition is that of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization: \"Land use concerns the products and/or benefits obtained from use of the land as well as the land management actions (activities) carried out by humans to produce those products and benefits.\" \nAs of the early 1990s, about 13% of the Earth was considered arable land, with 26% in pasture, 32% forests and woodland, and 1.5% urban areas.\nAs of 2015, the total arable land is 10.7% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland.\nFor example, the US Department of Agriculture has identified six major types of land use in the United States. Acreage statistics for each type of land use in the contiguous 48 states in 2017 were as follows:\n\"Special use\" areas in the table above include national parks (29 M acres) and state parks (15 M), wildlife areas (64.4 M), highways (21 M), railroads (3M), military bases (25 M), airports (3M) and a few others. \"Miscellaneous\" includes cemeteries, golf courses, marshes, deserts, and other areas of \"low economic value\". The total land area of the United States is 9.1 M km2 but the total used here refers only to the contiguous 48 states, without Alaska etc.\nLand use change.\n\"Land use change\" is \"the change from one land-use category to another\". Land-use change, together with use of fossil fuels, are the major anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide, a dominant greenhouse gas.\nHuman activity is the most significant cause of land cover change, and humans are also directly impacted by the environmental consequences of these changes. Collective land use and land cover changes have fundamentally altered the functioning of key Earth systems. For instance, human changes to land use and land cover have a profound impact on climate at a local and regional level, which in turn contributes to climate change.\nLand use by humans has a long history, first emerging more than 10,000 years ago. Human changes to land surfaces have been documented for centuries as having significant impacts on both earth systems and human well-being. Deforestation is an example of large-scale land use change. The deforestation of temperate regions since 1750 has had a major effect on land cover. The reshaping of landscapes to serve human needs, such as the deforestation for farmland, can have long-term effects on earth systems and exacerbate the causes of climate change. \nAlthough the burning of fossil fuels is the primary driver of present-day climate change, prior to the Industrial Revolution, deforestation and irrigation were the largest sources of human-driven greenhouse gas emissions. Even today, 35% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide contributions can be attributed to land use or land cover changes. Currently, almost 50% of Earth's non-ice land surface has been transformed by human activities, with approximately 40% of that land used for agriculture, surpassing natural systems as the principal source of nitrogen emissions.\nIncreasing land conversion by humans in future is not inevitable: In a discussion on response options to climate change mitigation and adaptation an IPCC special report stated that \"a number of response options such as increased food productivity, dietary choices and food losses, and waste reduction, can reduce demand for land conversion, thereby potentially freeing land and creating opportunities for enhanced implementation of other response options\".\nAnalytical methods.\nLand change science relies heavily on the synthesis of a wide range of data and a diverse range of data collection methods, some of which are detailed below.\nLand cover monitoring and assessments.\nA primary function of land change science is to document and model long-term patterns of landscape change, which may result from both human activity and natural processes. In the course of monitoring and assessing land cover and land use changes, scientists look at several factors, including where land-cover and land-use are changing, the extent and timescale of changes, and how changes vary through time. To this end, scientists use a variety of tools, including satellite imagery and other sources of remotely sensed data (e.g., aircraft imagery), field observations, historical accounts, and reconstruction modeling. These tools, particularly satellite imagery, allow land change scientists to accurately monitor land-change rates and create a consistent, long-term record to quantify change variability over time. Through observing patterns in land cover changes, scientists can determine the consequences of these changes, predict the impact of future changes, and use this information to inform strategic land management.\nModeling risk and vulnerability.\nModeling risk and vulnerability is also one of land change science's practical applications. Accurate predictions of how human activity will influence land cover change over time, as well as the impact that such changes have on the sustainability of ecological and human systems, can inform the creation of policy designed to address these changes.\nStudying risk and vulnerability entails the development of quantitative, qualitative, and geospatial models, methods, and support tools. The purpose of these tools is to communicate the vulnerability of both human communities and natural ecosystems to hazard events or long-term land change. Modeling risk and vulnerability requires analyses of community sensitivity to hazards, an understanding of geographic distributions of people and infrastructure, and accurate calculation of the probability of specific disturbances occurring.\nLand change modeling.\nA key method for studying risk and vulnerability is land change modeling (LCM), which can be used to simulate changes and land use and land cover. LCMs can be used to predict how land use and land cover may change under alternate circumstances, which is useful for risk assessment, in that it allows for the prediction of potential impacts and can be used to inform policy decisions, albeit with some uncertainty.\nExamples of land use change.\nDeforestation.\nDeforestation is the systematic and permanent conversion of previously forested land for other uses. It has historically been a primary facilitator of land use and land cover change. Forests are a vital part of the global ecosystem and are essential to carbon capture, ecological processes, and biodiversity. However, since the invention of agriculture, global forest cover has diminished by 35%. \nThere is rarely one direct or underlying cause for deforestation. Rather, deforestation is the result of intertwining systemic forces working simultaneously or sequentially to change land cover. Deforestation occurs for many interconnected reasons. For instance, mass deforestation is often viewed as the product of industrial agriculture, yet a considerable portion old-growth forest deforestation is the result of small-scale migrant farming. As forest cover is removed, forest resources become exhausted and increasing populations lead to scarcity, which prompts people to move again to previously undisturbed forest, restarting the process of deforestation. There are several reasons behind this continued migration: poverty-driven lack of available farmland and high costs may lead to an increase in farming intensity on existing farmland. This leads to the overexploitation of farmland, and down the line results in desertification, another land cover change, which renders soil unusable and unprofitable, requiring farmers to seek out untouched and unpopulated old-growth forests.\nIn addition to rural migration and subsistence farming, economic development can also play a substantial role in deforestation. For example, road and railway expansions designed to increase quality of life have resulted in significant deforestation in the Amazon and Central America. Moreover, the underlying drivers of economic development are often linked to global economic engagement, ranging from increased exports to a foreign debt.\nUrbanization.\nBroadly, urbanization is the increasing number of people who live in urban areas. Urbanization refers to both urban population growth and the physical growth of urban areas. According to the United Nations, the global urban population has increased rapidly since 1950, from 751 million to 4.2 billion in 2018, and current trends predict this number will continue to grow. Accompanying this population shift are significant changes in economic flow, culture and lifestyle, and spatial population distribution. Although urbanized areas cover just 3% of the Earth's surface, they nevertheless have a significant impact on land use and land cover change.\nUrbanization is important to land use and land cover change for a variety of reasons. In particular, urbanization affects land change elsewhere through the shifting of \"urban-rural linkages,\" or the ecological footprint of the transfer of goods and services between urban and rural areas. Increases in urbanization lead to increases in consumption, which puts increased pressure on surrounding rural lands. The outward spread of urban areas can also take over adjacent land formerly used for crop cultivation.\nUrbanization additionally affects land cover through the urban heat island effect. Heat islands occur when, due to high concentrations of structures, such as buildings and roads, that absorb and re-emit solar radiation, and low concentrations of vegetative cover, urban areas experience higher temperatures than surrounding areas. The high temperatures associated with heat islands can compromise human health, particularly in low-income areas.\nDecline of the Aral Sea.\nThe rapid decline of the Aral Sea is an example how local-scale land use and land change can have compounded impacts on regional climate systems, particularly when human activities heavily disrupt natural climatic cycles, how land change science can be used to map and study such changes. In 1960, the Aral Sea, located in Central Asia, was the world's fourth largest lake. However, a water diversion project, undertaken by the Soviet Union to irrigate arid plains in what is now Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, resulted in the Aral Sea losing 85% of its land cover and 90% of its volume. The loss of the Aral Sea has had a significant effect on human-environment interactions in the region, including the decimation of the sea's fishing industry and the salinization of agricultural lands by the wind-spread of dried sea salt beds. \nAdditionally, scientists have been able to use technology such as NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to track changes to the Aral Sea and its surrounding climate over time. This use of modeling and satellite imagery to track human-caused land cover change is characteristic of the scope of land change science.\nRegulation.\nCommonly, political jurisdictions will undertake land-use planning and regulate the use of land in an attempt to avoid land-use conflicts. Land use plans are implemented through land division and use ordinances and regulations, such as zoning regulations.\nThe urban growth boundary is one form of land-use regulation. For example, Portland, Oregon is required to have an urban growth boundary which contains at least of vacant land. Additionally, Oregon restricts the development of farmland. The regulations are controversial, but an economic analysis concluded that farmland appreciated similarly to the other land.\nUnited States.\nIn colonial America, few regulations were originally put into place regarding the usage of land. As society shifted from rural to urban, public land regulation became important, especially to city governments trying to control industry, commerce, and housing within their boundaries. The first zoning ordinance was passed in New York City in 1916, and, by the 1930s, most states had adopted zoning laws. In the 1970s, concerns about the environment and historic preservation led to further regulation.\nToday, federal, state, and local governments regulate growth and development through statutory law. The majority of controls on land, however, stem from the actions of private developers and individuals. Judicial decisions and enforcement of private land-use arrangements can reinforce public regulation, and achieve forms and levels of control that regulatory zoning cannot. There is growing concern that land use regulation is a direct cause of housing segregation in the United States today.\nTwo major federal laws passed in the 1960s limit the use of land significantly. These are the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (today embodied in 16 U.S.C. 461 et seq.) and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 Census, the population was 357,978. The county is named in honor of U.S. Senator Stephen A. Douglas. The county seat is Castle Rock.\nDouglas County is part of the Denver metropolitan area. It is located midway between Colorado's two largest cities, Denver and Colorado Springs, and contains a portion of Aurora, the state's third-largest city. Douglas County has the highest median household income of any Colorado county or statistical equivalent. It is ranked seventh nationally in that category.\nOverview.\nDouglas County is lightly wooded, mostly with ponderosa pine, with broken terrain characterized by mesas, foothills, and small streams. Cherry Creek and Plum Creek rise in Douglas County and flow north toward Denver and into the South Platte River. Both were subject to flash flooding in the past, Plum Creek being partially responsible for the Denver flood of 1965. Cherry Creek and Plum Creek are now dammed.\nMost residents commute to workplaces elsewhere in the metropolitan area outside of the county. Suburban development is supplementing the traditional ranching economy of the county.\nHistory.\nDouglas County was one of the original 17 counties created in the Colorado Territory by the Colorado Territorial Legislature on November 1, 1861. The county was named in honor of U.S. Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, who died five months before the county was created. The county seat was originally Franktown, but was moved to California Ranch in 1863, and then to Castle Rock in 1874. Although the county's boundaries originally extended eastward to the Kansas state border, in 1874, most of the eastern portion of the county became part of Elbert County.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which are land and (0.3%) are covered by water.\nParks and recreational areas.\nThree state parks fall within Douglas County: Castlewood Canyon State Park, Chatfield State Park and Roxborough State Park. Parts of the county lie within the Pike National Forest and were crossed by the historic South Platte Trail.\nRecreation trails in the county include:\nThe Rueter\u2013Hess Reservoir, when filled, may provide significant recreation, including fishing, hiking, and nonmotorized boating. If filled to capacity, surface size would be 1,140 acres, making this a fairly significant reservoir in Colorado and Douglas County's largest body of water.\nCherokee Ranch and Castle is a 3,400-acre privately owned property which forms a 12,000-acre open space with the Highlands Ranch Backcountry and Daniels Park. The area is host to a variety of animals and the Cherokee Ranch petrified forest.\nThe Prairie Canyon Ranch, at 4620 CO-83, about south of Franktown, is a Douglas County Open Space.

The town\u2019s population was 73,158 at the 2020 census, a 51.68% increase since the 2010 census. Castle Rock is the most-populous Colorado town (rather than city) and the 14th-most populous Colorado municipality. Castle Rock is a part of the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO metropolitan statistical area and the Front Range urban corridor.\nThe town is named for the prominent, castle-shaped butte near the center of town.\nHistory.\nWhite settlers were drawn to the area by rumors of gold and by land opened through the Homestead Act of 1862. The discovery of rhyolite stone, though, not gold, ultimately led to the settlement of Castle Rock.\nCastle Rock was founded in 1874 when the eastern Douglas County border was redrawn to its present location. Castle Rock was chosen as the county seat because of its central location.\nOne of the first homesteaders in the area near today's Castle Rock was Jeremiah Gould. He owned about to the south of \"the (Castle) Rock\". At that time, the settlement consisted of just a few buildings for prospectors, workers, and cowboys. In 1874, Gould donated to the new town, which was also now home to the Douglas County government. Six streets named Elbert, Jerry, Wilcox, Perry, Castle, and Front were laid out to build the actual town of Castle Rock. The courthouse square was defined and about 77 lots, each , were auctioned off for a total profit of US$3,400.\nA new train depot brought the Denver and Rio Grande Railway to the area.\nDuring the late 1800s and early 1900s, Castle Rock had a very active rhyolite-quarrying industry. Many immigrants arrived in the area to work in the quarries.\nIn 1936, the town received a donation of land that included its namesake geographical feature. Men employed by the Works Progress Administration constructed a star atop the butte shortly after Castle Rock received that donation. The star was lit every year from 1936 to 1941. After World War II began, the star was left unlit as a symbol of sacrifice in support of the war effort. On August 14, 1945, shortly after V-J Day, the star was modified into a V-for-victory symbol. On December 7, 1945, the star was lit for the holiday season. It has been lit every year since around the same time.\nThe town's historic county courthouse, which was built in 1889\u20131890, burned down on March 11, 1978, the result of arson.\nCastle Rock's municipal government experienced significant financial difficulties during the early 1980s. In 1984, the town's voters approved a charter amendment that authorized the creation of a home-rule charter commission. The home-rule charter was finalized in 1987.\nThe original Douglas County courthouse was one of seven buildings in Castle Rock that have been added to the National Register of Historic Places. The other buildings include Castle Rock Depot, Castle Rock Elementary School, First National Bank of Douglas County, Samuel Dyer House, Benjamin Hammer House, and Keystone Hotel.\nA dispute about whether the Castle Rock Police Department was required to enforce a civil restraining order was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005. The court held, in \"Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales\", that a municipality cannot be held liable under a federal civil-rights statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983, for failing to enforce civil restraining orders. The case had arisen from a 1999 murder of three young girls by their father outside the Castle Rock Police Department building. The children were killed by their father, in violation of the restraining order that had been obtained by their mother, within several hours of being abducted. The mother had asked the Castle Rock police to enforce the restraining order by finding and apprehending the father after he removed the children from her home and before the murders. Castle Rock police officers declined to do so, refusing even to contact the Denver Police Department after the mother notified them that the father had taken the children to an amusement park in that city.\nGeography.\nCastle Rock is located at (39.372212, \u2212104.856090) at an elevation of 6,224 feet (1,897 m). Castle Rock is in central Colorado at the junction of Interstate 25 and State Highway 86, south of downtown Denver and north of Colorado Springs.\nThe town lies a few miles east of the Rampart Range of the Rocky Mountains on the western edge of the Great Plains. Castle Rock, the butte for which the town is named, is just north of the town center. Other prominent landforms visible from Castle Rock include Dawson Butte, Devils Head, Mount Blue Sky, and Pikes Peak.\nEast Plum Creek, a stream within the South Platte River watershed, flows generally north through Castle Rock. Hangman's Gulch, which runs northwest then west around the north side of the town center, drains into East Plum Creek, as do multiple unnamed gulches in the southern and western areas of town. McMurdo Gulch and Mitchell Gulch run north then northeast through eastern Castle Rock and drain into Cherry Creek east of town.\nCastle Rock is in the Colorado Foothills life zone. The hillsides are covered with meadows of grass, small plants, scattered juniper trees, and open ponderosa pine woodlands. Other trees common in the area include Gambel oak (scrub oak or oak brush) and pinyon pine. Local wildlife includes the American badger, American black bear, bobcat, coyote, Colorado chipmunk, crow, garter snakes, gray fox, mountain cottontail rabbit, mountain lion, mule deer, pocket gopher, porcupine, skunk, and tadpoles. Birds found in the area include the golden eagle, peregrine falcon, sharp-shinned hawk, black-billed magpie, red-tailed hawk, pinyon jay, and western tanager.\nThe town had a total area of , all land in 2023.\nLying within the Front Range urban corridor, the town is part of the greater Denver metropolitan area. Castle Rock borders three communities, all to its north; from west to east, they are Castle Pines Village, the city of Castle Pines, and The Pinery. Other nearby communities include Franktown to the east, Larkspur to the south, Perry Park to the southwest, and Sedalia to the northwest.\nClimate.\nCastle Rock has a semiarid climate (K\u00f6ppen \"BSk\") with cold, dry, snowy winters, and hot, wetter summers. January is the coldest month, July the hottest, and August the month with the most precipitation.\nStatewide, Colorado has experienced an average temperature increase of about over the past half-century. Given its location in the center of the state, Castle Rock is expected to experience continuing warming and higher average temperatures through the 21st century, as the effects of climate change continue to be felt. Daily minimum temperatures are also expected to continue rising, as they have for the past 30 years.\nNeighborhoods.\nCastle Rock's ZIP codes include many neighborhoods:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCastle Rock encompasses about , with a population of more than 73,000.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010 census.\nAs of the 2010 census, 48,231 people, 16,688 households, and 12,974 families were residing in the town.

Males had a median income of $66,993 versus $47,087 for females. The per capita income for the town was $34,089. About 4.0% of families and 6.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.2% of those under 18 and 6.2% of those 65 or over.\nCastle Rock is the 16th-most populous municipality in Colorado and is the center of the burgeoning urbanization of the county.\nEconomy.\nBecause of its Front Range location between Denver and its inner suburbs and Colorado Springs, many of Castle Rock's residents commute nearly 40 miles to southern Colorado Springs on I-25 or the Denver Technological Center, better known as the Denver Tech Center, which is an 18-mile drive north, with downtown Denver roughly 30 miles north, and Denver International Airport about 45 miles north.\nAbout 80% of Castle Rock residents commute out of town to work. The average one-way commute time for a Castle Rock resident is about 29 minutes, longer than the U.S. average. One reason for this is that the town has not yet attracted the variety or extent of employers needed to significantly lower the number of commuters to work outside Castle Rock. The town has relatively little land zoned for industrial or light industrial use, with the vast majority of the land within town limits dedicated to residential construction only.\nAs of 2011, 78.2% of the population over the age of 16 was in the labor force, 0.4% was in the armed forces, and 77.7% was in the civilian labor force, with 72.6% employed and 5.1% unemployed. The employed civilian labor force was 48.0% in management, business, science, and arts; 25.8% in sales and office occupations; 14.7% in service occupations; 6.4% in natural resources, construction, and maintenance; and 5.2% in production, transportation, and material moving. The three industries employing the largest proportion of the working civilian labor force were educational services, health care, and social assistance (15.5%); professional, scientific, and management, and administrative and waste management services (13.2%); and finance and insurance, and real estate and rental and leasing (12.6%).\nCastle Rock's cost of living is above average. Compared to a U.S. average of 100, the cost of living index for the town is 137.2.\nAs of mid-2019, the median home value in the town was $427,537. The median gross monthly rent for an apartment was about $1,461.\nThe town's housing base continues to grow. About 1,400 permits to build new homes were issued in 2018.\nGovernment and politics.\nCastle Rock is a home-rule municipality with a council\u2013manager form of government. The town's governing body is the town council, made up of seven members including the mayor and mayor pro-tem. Each councilmember is elected to represent an election district, and the mayor is elected to represent the town at large. One member, appointed by the council, serves as the mayor pro-tem. Castle Rock voters approved a change to the town charter that authorized an at-large mayor in 2017.\nThe mayor presides over council meetings and casts one vote, like other councilmembers. The council sets policy for the town, adopts ordinances, approves the town budget, makes major land-use decisions, and appoints key town government staff, including the town manager, town attorney, municipal judge, and members of town boards and commissions.\nThe town manager supervises all departments, prepares and implements the town budget, and works with the council to develop policies and propose new plans.\nTax revenues are used to provide general government, fire, police, parks maintenance and programs, street maintenance and operations, support for recreation, and planning and code enforcement services. The town also provides development services, golf, water, and sewer services to residents through self-supporting enterprise funds. The average annual municipal property tax bill of a Castle Rock resident is $40.66. That is in addition to property taxes assessed by Douglas County and other entities.\nAs the county seat, Castle Rock is the administrative center of Douglas County. The county courthouse, the Douglas County Justice Center, is north of downtown, and most departments of the county government base their operations in the town.\nAs of 2013[ [update]], Castle Rock lies within Colorado's 4th U.S. Congressional District. The town is in the 4th district of the Colorado Senate and the 45th district of the Colorado House of Representatives.\nCastle Rock is the county seat of Douglas County, a Republican stronghold in Colorado.\nEducation.\nPrimary and secondary education.\nDouglas County School District, based in Castle Rock, operates 18 public schools in the town. These include 10 elementary schools, two middle schools, two charter schools, one magnet school, one alternative high school, and two high schools: Castle View High School and Douglas County High School. In addition, there are three private primary schools in Castle Rock.\nSchool-board elections in Douglas County are held in odd-numbered years. In recent years, the community has experienced a spirited debate between supporters of significant change in the management of local schools and those who oppose such changes or believe they should advance at a slower pace.\nLibraries.\nThe Douglas County Libraries public library system is based in Castle Rock, co-located with the local branch library, the Philip S. Miller Library, south of downtown. The Miller Library includes archives and local history and offers several educational and recreational programs to the public. Also, it includes Little Free Library places scattered throughout, such as in the festival park.\nInfrastructure.\nTransportation.\nInterstate 25 and U.S. Route 87 run concurrently north-south through Castle Rock. U.S. Route 85, also a north-south route, enters the town from the northwest, meeting I-25 at Exit 184; south of the exit, it runs concurrently with I-25 and U.S. 87. Colorado State Highway 86, an east-west route, enters Castle Rock from the east, then turns north and west as Founders Parkway, terminating at its junction with I-25 at Exit 184.\nFor local transportation within Castle Rock, the town government sponsors a voucher program for reduced-fare taxi service. This service is available to town residents who are disabled or who do not have access to a vehicle. In addition, the Castle Rock Senior Center offers a shuttle service for resident senior citizens.\nCastle Rock does not participate in the Denver metropolitan area's Regional Transportation District. Municipal voters decided in November 2005 to opt the town out of the district. As a result, neither bus nor light-rail service to Denver or any of its other suburbs is available from Castle Rock.\nBNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad each have a freight rail line that runs through Castle Rock. Both lines run parallel to U.S. 85.\nUtilities and water.\nCORE Electric Cooperative, based in nearby Sedalia, provides electric power. Black Hills Energy provides natural-gas service. Waste Management and other businesses provide trash removal.\nThe town government's Utilities Department oversees water provision, distribution, and infrastructure maintenance. Historically, nearly all of the water needed by Castle Rock residents was pumped from aquifers below the ground, including the https://. Beginning in 2013, when the town developed its first strategic plan for the management of water, Castle Rock has moved toward more use of surface water. Between 2006 and 2018, daily per capita water use in Castle Rock declined from 137 gallons to 115 gallons.\nStarting in 2020, Castle Rock expected to begin treating sink, tap, and toilet water to potable water quality standards so that it can be reused. The town aimed to achieve a goal of reliance upon renewable water resources for 75% of municipal needs by 2050 and, by 2020, about one-third of all water used in Castle Rock was expected to be from a reusable source.\nAs of July 2019 Castle Rock, Denver, and Pitkin County are the first three Colorado municipal or county governments to adopt a state https:// governing greywater reuse.\nHealth care.\nAdventHealth Castle Rock is the only hospital.\nMedia.\nFounded in 1895, Castle Rock News-Press is the only newspaper.\nCastle Rock is part of the Denver radio and television market. Radio station KJMN is licensed to Castle Rock, but broadcasts from Denver playing a Spanish adult hits format on 92.1 FM. Denver radio station 850 KOA, which broadcasts a news/talk and sports format, operates its 50,000-watt transmitter from a site 10 miles northeast of downtown Castle Rock, in the town of Parker. Another Denver station, KAMP (1430 AM), a CBS Sports Radio affiliate with a sports radio format, operates its transmitter from Highlands Ranch, 13 miles north of downtown Castle Rock.\nNPR programming can be heard on Colorado Public Radio's KCFR-FM. Castle Rock is also served by the AM signal of KGNU, a noncommercial affiliate of PRI, Pacifica, and the BBC World Service, and which also provides diverse music programming.\nTelevision station KETD, an affiliate of the Estrella TV network, broadcasts on digital channel 46. Licensed to Castle Rock, the station is located near Centennial, Colorado.\nParks and recreation.\nCastle Rock's open space and parks comprise 27% the town's total land area ( of parks and open space / total land area). Additionally, there are nearly of soft-surface and paved trails.\nCulture.\nPoints of interest.\nPhilip S. Miller Park is the largest park project in Castle Rock. \"Phase One\" of the park was opened to the public on October 25, 2014. The park is named after a local banker and philanthropist, who with his wife Jerry, left trust monies to Castle Rock in the mid-1990s. The Phillip S. Miller Activity Center is included in the park's 300 acres.\nThe Castle Rock Historical Museum is in the former Denver and Rio Grande Railway depot building on Elbert Street. This building is purported to have been built in 1875. It is made of rhyolite taken from local quarries. The museum depicts how Castle Rock has changed over the years.\nSports.\nFrom 1986 through 2006, a professional golf tournament was held in Castle Pines Village. The International, a PGA Tour event, was held in August at the Castle Pines Golf Club.\nEvents.\nCastle Rock star lighting.\nSince 1936, every Saturday before Thanksgiving, the Town of Castle Rock lights the electric star upon Castle Rock. A lighting event is held downtown that night and is usually accompanied by a fireworks display. The star remains lit from the week before Thanksgiving to the end of the National Western Stock Show in January. This has changed multiple times; following World War II, it was changed to a V, also, the same year as the Denver Broncos being in the Super Bowl, it was changed to orange and blue. Throughout part of the lockdown in early 2020 due to COVID-19, the star was relit as a symbol of unity.\nNotable people.\nNotable individuals who were born in or have lived in Castle Rock include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is primarily a north\u2013south highway, serving as the main route through New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. I-25 stretches from I-10 at Las Cruces, New Mexico (approximately north of El Paso, Texas) to I-90 in Buffalo, Wyoming (approximately south of the Montana\u2013Wyoming border). It passes through or near Albuquerque, New Mexico; Pueblo, Colorado Springs, and Denver in Colorado; and Cheyenne and Casper in Wyoming. The I-25 corridor is mainly rural, especially in Wyoming, excluding the Albuquerque metropolitan area and the Front Range urban corridor from Pueblo to Cheyenne.\nThe part of I-25 in Colorado passes just east of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. That stretch was involved in a large-scale renovation named the Transportation Expansion (T-REX) Project in Denver and the Colorado Springs Metropolitan Interstate Expansion (COSMIX). These projects, and others in New Mexico, were necessary because these stretches of I-25 were originally inadequately designed and constructed (the pavement was deteriorating rapidly) and also because urban areas, like Albuquerque, Colorado Springs, and Denver, had tripled and quadrupled in population much earlier than anyone had anticipated back in the 1950s and 1960s. Major highway work for the T-REX project ended on August 22, 2006. The COSMIX project was completed in December 2007. Several other smaller improvement projects for I-25 are still ongoing within New Mexico and Colorado.\nRoute description.\nNew Mexico.\nI-25 begins at I-10's exit\u00a0144 in Las Cruces, just south of the New Mexico State University campus. I-25 runs concurrently with US Route\u00a085 (US\u00a085) at this point and carries this concurrency for the entire length of its run in New Mexico. Immediately, three exits provide access to the city, including one for US\u00a070. When I-25 reaches Truth or Consequences, it is parallel to Elephant Butte Lake State Park. From Las Cruces to Santa Fe, I-25 follows the route of the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro.\nAs I-25 nears Albuquerque, it has interchanges with highways, such as US\u00a0380, and a concurrency with US\u00a060. Further north, State Road\u00a06 (NM\u00a06), former US\u00a066, meets up with I-25 in Los Lunas. Through Albuquerque, I-25 is named the Pan American Freeway, and there are frequent exits to city streets. A major interchange with I-40 (which is styled as the Coronado Freeway in the city) is named the Big I. It was given an honorable mention by the US Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration for excellence in urban highway design in 2002.\nLeaving Albuquerque to the north, I-25 curves to the northeast as it approaches Santa Fe. Continuing 'northbound' at Santa Fe, I-25 heads southeast for approximately traveling through the Santa Fe National Forest and crossing Glorieta Pass (elevation ). It turns north again at Blanchard toward Las Vegas. The highway maintains a north and northeast orientation as it leaves New Mexico traversing Raton Pass () and enters Colorado. Due to its elevation and frequent winter snowstorms, I-25 is sometimes impassible and closed in both directions at Raton Pass during winter months. From Santa Fe to Trinidad, Colorado, I-25 approximates part of the route of the Santa Fe Trail. For its entire length in the state, I-25 shares its alignment with US\u00a085, although the latter is unsigned.\nColorado.\nI-25 has many nicknames through the state's larger cities. In Denver, it is called the Valley Highway, as the highway parallels the course of the South Platte River throughout the downtown area and is often sunken below ground level. The section in El Paso County is named the Ronald Reagan Highway, and, through Pueblo, it is named the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway. \nIn the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973, a transcontinental highway was named after President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in commemoration of the route of the US Army's 1919 convoy. This route, rather than following a single highway, spans several, including I-25 in Denver. This combination of routes was intended to approximate the original 1919 convoy route.\nThe designation of this highway, while clear in intent, has not seen widespread adoption in terms of signage or recognition, likely due to the irregular nature of the route. Despite this, a commemorative sign was installed in 1986 in the tourist information center off I-70 in Kansas City, Kansas. Congress attempted to honor Eisenhower's contributions to the Interstate System once more in 1990, leading to the renaming of the Interstate System as the \"Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways\".\nI-25 enters Colorado south of the city of Trinidad. It is the main north\u2013south route through Colorado with a length of . The Interstate exits Colorado in the north about south of Cheyenne, Wyoming. I-25 serves all the major cities in Colorado that are east of the Rocky Mountains, such as Denver, Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Fort Collins, and Greeley. For the entire distance in Colorado, from the north to the south, the Rocky Mountains are clearly visible.\nThere are also several important military and air bases and institutions along this route, such as Buckley Space Force Base, the Cheyenne Mountain Complex headquarters of NORAD, Fort Carson, Peterson Space Force Base, and the United States Air Force Academy.\nI-25 crosses the Palmer Divide between Denver and Colorado Springs, providing some of the highway's most scenic views of the Rocky Mountains and its foothills. Blizzards and high winds on this stretch (particularly over Monument Hill) are notorious for causing traffic problems during the winter months.\nThe section of I-25 that is between the northern border of Pueblo County and the New Mexico state line is named the \"John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway\" in honor of President Kennedy's support of water resources development in the Arkansas River Valley.\nWyoming.\nI-25 enters Wyoming south of the state capital, Cheyenne. After traveling through Cheyenne, I-25 continues north to Douglas, passing many plateaus and also railroad tracks. Commonly, very long trains can be seen slowly moving alongside this highway. Around Douglas, this Interstate Highway curves somewhat to the west toward Casper. Once through Casper, I-25 turns due north, and it goes as far as Buffalo, where it ends at an interchange with I-90. I-90 then provides the connection to Montana.\nHistory.\nThe section in New Mexico between Romeroville and Los Lunas closely follows the original alignment of US\u00a066, which was later shortened and realigned to run due west from Santa Rosa. Now, that has been replaced with I-40.\n on the Las Cruces\u2013University Park line.

{"id": "56313", "revid": "14614106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56313", "title": "Zoning", "text": "Government policy allowing certain uses of land in different places\nIn urban planning, zoning is a method in which a municipality or other tier of government divides land into land-use and building \"zones\", each of which has a set of regulations for new development that differs from other zones. Zones may be defined for a single use (e.g. residential, industrial), they may combine several compatible activities by use, or in the case of form-based zoning, the differing regulations may govern the density, size and shape of allowed buildings whatever their use. The planning rules for each zone determine whether planning permission for a given development may be granted. Zoning may specify a variety of outright and conditional uses of land. It may indicate the size and dimensions of lots that land may be subdivided into, or the form and scale of buildings. These guidelines are set in order to guide urban growth and development.\nZoning is the most common regulatory urban planning method used by local governments in developed countries. Exceptions include the United Kingdom and the city of Houston, Texas.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMost zoning systems have a procedure for granting variances (exceptions to the zoning rules), usually because of some perceived hardship caused by the particular nature of the property in question.\nHistory.\nThe origins of zoning districts can be traced back to antiquity. The ancient walled city was the predecessor for classifying and regulating land, based on use. Outside the city walls were the undesirable functions, which were usually based on noise and smell. The space between the walls is where unsanitary and dangerous activities occurred such as butchering, waste disposal, and brick-firing. Within the walls were civic and religious places, and where the majority of people lived.\nBeyond distinguishing between urban and non-urban land, most ancient cities further classified land types and uses inside their walls. This was practiced in many regions of the world \u2013 for example, in China during the Zhou Dynasty (1046 \u2013 256 BC), in India during the Vedic Era (1500 \u2013 500 BC), and in the military camps that spread throughout the Roman Empire (31 BC \u2013 476 AD).\nThroughout the Age of Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution, cultural and socio-economic shifts led to the rapid increase in the enforcement and invention of urban regulations. The shifts were informed by a new scientific rationality, the advent of mass production and complex manufacturing, and the subsequent onset of urbanisation. Industry leaving the home reshaped modern cities. The definition of home was tied to the definition of economy, which caused a much greater mixing of uses within the residential quarters of cities.\nSeparation between uses is a feature of many planned cities designed before the advent of zoning. A notable example is Adelaide in South Australia, whose city centre, along with the suburb of North Adelaide, is surrounded on all sides by a park, the Adelaide Park Lands. The park was designed by Colonel William Light in 1836 in order to physically separate the city centre from its suburbs. Low density residential areas surround the park, providing a pleasant walk between work in the city within and the family homes outside.\nSir Ebenezer Howard, founder of the garden city movement, cited Adelaide as an example of how green open space could be used to prevent cities from expanding beyond their boundaries and coalescing. His design for an ideal city, published in his 1902 book Garden Cities of To-morrow, envisaged separate concentric rings of public buildings, parks, retail space, residential areas and industrial areas, all surrounded by open space and farmland. All retail activity was to be conducted within a single glass-roofed building, an early concept for the modern shopping centre inspired by the Crystal Palace. 4\nHowever, these planned or ideal cities were static designs embodied in a single masterplan. What was lacking was a regulatory mechanism to allow the city to develop over time, setting guidelines to developers and private citizens over what could be built where. The first modern zoning systems were applied in the United States with the Los Angeles zoning ordinances of 1904 and the New York City 1916 Zoning Resolution.\nBut the first formal zoning ordinance in the United States was aimed at racial segregation. In 1885, the city of Modesto, California passed a law restricting the establishment of laundries into the city's Chinatown, a move aimed at stopping the encroachment of Chinese immigrants into previously white areas of the city.\nTypes.\nThere are a great variety of zoning types, some of which focus on regulating building form and the relation of buildings to the street with mixed uses, known as form-based, others with separating land uses, known as use-based, or a combination thereof. Use-based zoning systems can comprise single-use zones, mixed-use zones - where a compatible group of uses are allowed to co-exist - or a combination of both single and mixed-use zones in one system.\nThe main approaches include use-based, form-based, performance and incentive zoning. There are also several additional zoning provisions used in combination with the main approaches. \nMain approaches to zoning.\nUse-based zoning.\nUse-based or functional zoning systems can comprise single-use zones, mixed-use zones\u2014where a compatible group of uses are allowed to co-exist \u2014or a combination of both single- and mixed-use zones in one system.\nSingle-use zoning.\nThe primary purpose of single-use zoning is to geographically separate uses that are thought to be incompatible. In practice, zoning is also used to prevent new development from interfering with existing uses and/or to preserve the character of a community.\nSingle-use zoning is where only one kind of use is allowed per zone, or district. It is also known as exclusionary zoning65 or, in the United States, as \"Euclidean zoning\" because of a court case in Euclid, Ohio, \"Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co.\" 272 U.S. https:// (1926), which established its constitutionality. It has been the dominant system of zoning in North America, especially the United States, since its first implementation.\nCommonly defined single-use districts include: residential, commercial, and industrial. Each category can have a number of sub-categories, for example, within the commercial category there may be separate districts for small retail, large retail, office use, lodging and others, while industrial may be subdivided into heavy manufacturing, light assembly and warehouse uses. Special districts may also be created for purposes like public facilities, recreational amenities, and green space.\nThe application of single-use zoning has led to the distinctive form of many cities in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, in which a very dense urban core, often containing skyscrapers, is surrounded by low density residential suburbs, characterised by large gardens and leafy streets. Some metropolitan areas such as Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul and Sydney have several such cores.\nMixed-use zoning.\nMixed-use zoning combines residential, commercial, office, and public uses into a single space. Mixed-use zoning can be vertical, within a single building, or horizontal, involving multiple buildings. \nPlanning and community activist Jane Jacobs wrote extensively on the connections between the separation of uses and the failure of urban renewal projects in New York City. She advocated dense mixed-use developments and walkable streets. In contrast to villages and towns, in which many residents know one another, and low-density outer suburbs that attract few visitors, cities and inner city areas have the problem of maintaining order between strangers. This order is maintained when, throughout the day and evening, there are sufficient people present with eyes on the street. 45-65 This can be accomplished in successful urban districts that have a great diversity of uses, creating interest and attracting visitors. 155-190 Jacobs' writings, along with increasing concerns about urban sprawl, are often credited with inspiring the New Urbanism movement.\nTo accommodate the New Urbanist vision of walkable communities combining caf\u00e9s, restaurants, offices and residential development in a single area, mixed-use zones have been created within some zoning systems. These still use the basic regulatory mechanisms of zoning, excluding incompatible uses such as heavy industry or sewage farms, while allowing compatible uses such as residential, commercial and retail activities so that people can live, work and socialise within a compact geographic area.\nThe mixing of land uses is common throughout the world. Mixed-use zoning has particular relevance in the United States, where it is proposed as a remedy to the problems caused by widespread single-use zoning.\nForm-based zoning.\nForm-based or intensity zoning regulates not the type of land use, but the form that land use may take. For instance, form-based zoning in a dense area may insist on low setbacks, high density, and pedestrian accessibility. Form-based codes (FBCs) are designed to directly respond to the physical structure of a community in order to create more walkable and adaptable environments.\nForm-based zoning codes have five main elements: a regulating plan, public standards, building standards, and precise definitions of technical terms. Form-based codes recognize the interrelated nature of all components of land-use planning\u2014zoning, subdivision, and public works\u2014and integrate them to define districts based on the community's desired character and intensity of development.\nThe French planning system is mostly form-based; zones in French cities generally allow many types of uses. The city of Paris has used its zoning system to concentrate high-density office buildings in the district of La D\u00e9fense rather than allow heritage buildings across the city to be demolished to make way for them, as is often the case in London or New York. The construction of the Montparnasse Tower in 1973 led to an outcry. As a result, two years after its completion the construction of buildings over seven storeys high in the city centre was banned.\nPerformance zoning.\nPerformance zoning, also known as flexible or impact zoning or effects-based planning, was first advocated by Lane Kendig in 1973. It uses performance-based or goal-oriented criteria to establish review parameters for proposed development projects. Performance zoning may use a menu of compliance options where a property developer can earn points or credits for limiting environmental impacts, including affordable housing units, or providing public amenities. In addition to the menu and points system, there may be additional discretionary criteria included in the review process. Performance zoning may be applied only to a specific type of development, such as housing, and may be combined with a system of use-based districts. \nPerformance zoning is flexible, logical, and transparent while offering a form of accountability. These qualities are in contrast with the seemingly arbitrary nature of use-based zoning. Performance zoning can also fairly balance a region's environmental and housing needs across local jurisdictions. Performance zoning balances principles of markets and private property rights with environmental protection goals. However, performance zoning can be extremely difficult to implement due to the complexity of preparing an impact study for each project,77 and can require the supervising authority to exercise a lot of discretion. Performance zoning has not been adopted widely in the US. \nIncentive zoning.\nIncentive zoning allows property developers to develop land more intensively, such as with greater density or taller buildings, in exchange for providing some public benefits, such as environmental amenities or affordable housing units. The public benefits most often incentivised by US cities are \"mixed-use development, open space conservation, walkability, affordable housing, and public parks.\" \nIncentive zoning allows for a high degree of flexibility, but may be complex to administer. The more a proposed development takes advantage of incentive criteria, the more closely it has to be reviewed on a discretionary basis. The initial creation of the incentive structure in order to best serve planning priorities also may be challenging and often requires extensive ongoing revision to maintain balance between incentive magnitude and value given to developers. Incentive zoning may be most effective in communities with well-established standards and where demand for both land and for specific amenities is high. However, hidden costs may still offset its benefits. Incentive zoning has also been criticized for increasing traffic, reducing natural light, and offering developers larger rewards than those reaped by the public.\nAdditional provisions.\nAdditional zoning provisions exist that are not their own distinct types of zoning but seek to improve existing varieties through the incorporation of flexible practices and other elements such as information and communication technologies (ICTs).\nSmart zoning.\nSmart zoning is a broad term that consists of several alternatives to use-based zoning that incorporate information and communication technologies. There are a number of different techniques to accomplish smart zoning. Floating zones, cluster zoning, and planned unit developments (PUDs) are possible\u2014even as the conventional use-based code exists\u2014or the conventional code may be completely replaced by a smart performance or form-based code, as the city of Miami did in 2019. The incorporation of ICTs to measure metrics such as walkability, and the flexibility and adaptability that smart zoning can provide, have been cited as advantages of smart zoning over \"non-smart\" performance or form-based codes.\nFloating zones.\nFloating zones describe a zoning district's characteristics and codify requirements for its establishment, but its location remains unspecified until conditions exist to implement that type of zoning district. When the criteria for implementation of a floating zone are met, the floating zone ceases \"to float\" and its location is established by a zoning amendment. \nCluster zoning.\nCluster zoning permits residential uses to be clustered more closely together than normally allowed, thereby leaving substantial land area to be devoted to open space. Cluster zoning has been favored for its preservation of open space and reduction in construction and utility costs via consolidation, although existing residents may often disapprove due to a reduction in lot sizes.\nPlanned unit development (PUD).\nThe term planned unit development (PUD) can refer either to the regulatory process or to the development itself. A PUD groups multiple compatible land uses within a single unified development. A PUD can be residential, mixed-use, or a larger master-planned community. Rather than being governed by standard zoning ordinances, the developer negotiates terms with the local government. At best, a PUD provides flexibility to create convenient ways for residents to access commercial and other amenities. In the US, residents of a PUD have an ongoing role in management of the development through a homeowner's association.\nPattern zoning.\nPattern zoning is a zoning technique in which a municipality provides licensed, pre-approved building designs, typically with an expedited permitting process. Pattern zoning is used to reduce barriers to housing development, create more affordable housing, reduce burdens on permit-review staff, and create quality housing designs within a certain neighborhood or jurisdiction. Pattern zoning may also be used to promote certain building types such as missing middle housing and affordable small-scale commercial properties. In some cases, a municipality purchases design patterns and constructs the properties themselves while in other cases the municipality offers the patterns for private development.\nHybrid zoning.\nA hybrid zoning code combines two or more approaches, often use-based and form-based zoning. Hybrid zoning can be used to introduce form and design considerations into an existing community's zoning without completely rewriting the zoning ordinance.\nComposite zoning is a particular type of hybrid zoning that combines use, form, and site design components: \nAn advantage of composite zoning is the ability to create flexible zoning districts for smoother transitions between adjacent properties with different uses.\nInclusionary zoning.\nInclusionary zoning refers to policies to increase the number of housing units within a development that are affordable to low and middle-income households. These policies can be mandatory as part of performance zoning or based on voluntary incentives, such as allowing greater density of development.\nOverlay zoning.\nAn overlay zone is a zoning district that overlaps one or more zoning districts to address a particular concern or feature of that area, such as wetlands, historic buildings or transit-oriented development. Overlay zoning has the advantage of providing targeted regulation to address a specific issue, such as a natural hazard, without having to significantly rewrite an existing zoning ordinance. However, development of overlay zoning regulation often requires significant technical expertise.\nTransferable development rights.\nTransferable development rights, also known as transfer of development credits and transferable development units, are based on the concept that with land ownership comes the right of use of land, or land development. These land-based development rights can, in some jurisdictions, be used, unused, sold, or otherwise transferred by the owner of a parcel. These are typically used to transfer development rights from rural areas (sending sites) to urban areas (receiving sites) with more demand and infrastructure to support development.\nSpot zoning.\nSpot zoning is a controversial practice in which a small part of a larger zoning district is rezoned in a way that is not consistent with the community's broader planning process. While a jurisdiction can rezone even a single parcel of land in some cases, spot zoning is often disallowed when the change would conflict with the policies and objectives of existing land-use plans. Other factors that may be considered in these cases are the size of the parcel, the zoning categories involved, how adjacent properties are zoned and used, and expected benefits and harms to the landowner, neighbors, and community.\nConditional zoning.\nConditional zoning is a legislative process in which site-specific standards and conditions become part of the zoning ordinance at the request of the property owner. The conditions may be more or less restrictive than the standard zoning. Conditional zoning can be considered spot zoning and can be challenged on those grounds.\nConditional zoning should not be confused with conditional-use permits (also called special-use permits), a quasi-judicial process that enables land uses that, because of their special nature, may be suitable only in certain locations, or when arranged or operated in a particular manner. Uses which might be disallowed under current zoning, such as a school or a community center, can be permitted via conditional-use permits.\nContract zoning.\nContract zoning is a controversial practice in which there is a bilateral agreement between a property owner and a local government to rezone a property in exchange for a commitment from the developer. It typically involves loosening restrictions on how the property can be used. Contract zoning is controversial and sometimes prohibited because it deviates from the broader planning process and has been considered an illegal bargaining away of the government's police powers to enforce zoning.\nFiscal zoning.\nFiscal zoning is a controversial practice in which local governments use land use regulation, including zoning, to encourage land uses that generate high tax revenue and exclude uses that place a high demand on public services.\nEffectiveness and criticism.\nEnvironmental activists argue that putting everyday uses out of walking distance of each other leads to an increase in traffic, since people have to own cars in order to live a normal life where their basic human needs are met, and get in their cars and drive to meet their needs throughout the day. Single-use zoning and urban sprawl have also been criticized as making work\u2013family balance more difficult to achieve, as greater distances need to be covered in order to integrate the different life domains. These issues are especially acute in the United States, with its high level of car usage combined with insufficient or poorly maintained urban rail and metro systems.\nSome economists claim that zoning laws work against economic efficiency, reduce responsiveness to consumer demands and hinder development in a free economy, as poor zoning restrictions hinder the more efficient usage of a given area. Even without zoning restrictions, a landfill, for example, would likely gravitate to cheaper land and not a residential area. Single-use zoning laws can get in the way of creative developments like mixed-use buildings and can even stop harmless activities like yard sales. The Houston example of \"non-zoning\" or \"private zoning\" with no restriction on particular land use but with other development code shows a combination of private and public planning.\nOther critics of zoning argue that zoning laws are a disincentive to provide housing which results in an increase in housing costs and a decrease in productive economic output. For example, A 2017 study showed that if all states deregulated their zoning laws only halfway to the level of Texas, a state known for low zoning regulations, their GDP would increase by 12 percent due to more productive workers and opportunity. Furthermore, critics note that it impedes the ability of those that wish to provide charitable housing from doing so. For example, in 2022, Gloversville's Free Methodist Church in New York wished to provide 40 beds for the homeless population in weather and were inhibited from doing so. \nCorruption is a challenge for zoning. Some have argued that zoning laws increase economic inequality. Empirical effectiveness estimates show some zoning approaches can contribute to housing crisis.\nAlternatives.\nIn Houston, Texas, the lack of a local zoning ordinance means that property owners make heavy use of deed restrictions to prevent unwanted development. This practice is sometimes known as \"private zoning\". Non-zoned land regulations can still include requirements like minimum lot size and setbacks.\nBy country.\nAustralia.\nThe legal framework for land use zoning in Australia is established by States and Territories, hence each State or Territory has different zoning rules. Land use zones are generally defined at local government level, and most often called Planning Schemes. In reality, however in all cases the state governments have an absolute ability to overrule the local decision-making. There are administrative appeal processes such as VCAT to challenge decisions.\nStatutory planning, otherwise known as town planning, development control or development management, refers to the part of the planning process that is concerned with the regulation and management of changes to land use and development. Planning and zoning have a great political dimension, with governments often criticized for favouring developers; also nimbyism is very prevalent.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, land-use control is a provincial responsibility deriving from the constitutional authority over property and civil rights. This authority had been granted to the provinces under the British North America Acts of 1867 and was carried forward in the Constitution Act, 1982. The zoning power relates to \"real property\", or land and the improvements constructed thereon that become part of the land itself (in Qu\u00e9bec, \"immeubles\"). The provinces empowered the municipalities and regions to control the use of land within their boundaries, letting the municipalities establish their own zoning by-laws. There are provisions for control of land use in unorganized areas of the provinces. Provincial tribunals are the ultimate authority for appeals and reviews.\nFrance.\nIn France, the Code of Urbanism (, also called the Town Planning Code), a national law, guides regional and local planning and outlines procedures for obtaining building permits. Unlike England where planners must use their discretion to allow use or building type changes, private development in France is permitted as long as the developer follows the legally-binding regulations.\nJapan.\nZoning districts are classified into twelve use zones. Each zone determines a building's shape and permitted uses. A building's shape is controlled by zonal restrictions on allowable floor area ratio and height (in absolute terms and in relation with adjacent buildings and roads). These controls are intended to allow adequate light and ventilation between buildings and on roads. Instead of single-use zoning, zones are defined by the \"most intense\" use permitted. Uses of lesser intensity are permitted in zones where higher intensity uses are permitted but higher intensity uses are not allowed in lower intensity zones.\nNew Zealand.\nNew Zealand's planning system is grounded in effects-based Performance Zoning under the Resource Management Act.\nPhilippines.\nZoning and land use planning in the Philippines is governed by the Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development (DHSUD) and previously by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), which lays out national zoning guidelines and regulations, and oversees the preparation and implementation of comprehensive land use plans (CLUPs) and zoning ordinances by city and municipal governments under their mandate in the Local Government Code of 1991 (Republic Act No. 7160).\nThe present zoning scheme used in the Philippines is detailed in the HLURB's Model Zoning Ordinance published in 2014, which outlines 26 basic zone types based on primary usage and building regulations (as defined in the National Building Code), and also includes public domain and water bodies within the municipality's jurisdiction. Local governments may also add overlays identifying special use zones such as areas prone to natural disasters, ancestral lands of indigenous peoples (IPs), heritage zones, ecotourism areas, transit-oriented developments (TODs), and scenic corridors. Residential and commercial zones are further subdivided into subclasses defined by density, commercial zones also allow for residential uses, and industrial zones are subdivided by their intensity and the environmental impact of the uses allowed. Regulations on residential, commercial, and industrial zones may differ between municipalities, so one municipality may permit 4-storey buildings on medium-density residential zones, while another may only permit 2-storey buildings.\nSingapore.\nThe framework for governing land uses in Singapore is administered by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) through the Master Plan. The Master Plan is a statutory document divided into two sections: the plans and the Written Statement. The plans show the land use zoning allowed across Singapore, while the Written Statement provides a written explanation of the zones available and their allowed uses.\nSouth Africa.\nThere are https://; residential, business, industrial, agricultural, and open space zoning. These five categories are further classified into subcategories. The zoning categories are governed by the Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act enacted in 2016. To change a land use from one zone to another requires a process of https://.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe United Kingdom does not use zoning as a technique for controlling land use. British land use control began its modern phase after the Town and Country Planning Act of 1947. Rather than dividing municipal maps into land use zones, English planning law places all development under the control of local and regional governments, effectively abolishing the ability to develop land by-right. However, existing development allows land use by-right as long as the use does not constitute a change in the type of land use. A property owner must apply to change land use type of any existing building, and such changes must be consistent with the local and regional land use plans.\nDevelopment control or planning control is the element of the United Kingdom's system of town and country planning through which local government regulates land use and new building. There are 421 Local Planning Authorities (LPAs) in the United Kingdom. Generally they are the local borough or district council or a unitary authority. They each use a discretionary \"plan-led system\" whereby development plans are formed and the public consulted. Subsequent development requires planning permission, which will be granted or refused with reference to the development plan as a material consideration.\nThe plan does not provide specific guidance on what type of buildings will be allowed in a given location, rather it provides general principles for development and goals for the management of urban change. Because planning committees (made up of directly elected local councillors) or in some cases planning officers themselves (via delegated decisions) have discretion on each application for development or change of use made, the system is considered a 'discretionary' one.\nPlanning applications can differ greatly in scale, from airports and new towns to minor modifications to individual houses. In order to prevent local authorities from being overwhelmed by high volumes of small-scale applications from individual householders, a separate system of permitted development has been introduced. Permitted development rules are largely form-based, but in the absence of zoning, are applied at the national level. Examples include allowing a two-storey extension up to three metres at the rear of a property, extensions up to 50% of the original width at each side, and certain types of outbuildings in the garden, provided that no more than 50% of the land area is built over. These are appropriately sized for a typical three bedroom semi-detached property, but must be applied across a wide variety of housing types, from small terraces, to larger detached properties and manor houses.\nIn August 2020, the UK Government published a consultation document called Planning for the Future. The proposals hinted at a move toward zoning in England, with areas given a Growth, Renewal or Protected designation, with the possibility of \"sub-areas within each category\", although the document did not elaborate on what the details of these might have been. Nothing was done with these proposals and following the 2024 general election there are no plans for the UK to adopt zoning within its planning system.\nUnited States.\nUnder the police power rights, state governments may exercise over private real property. With this power, special laws and regulations have long been made restricting the places where particular types of business can be carried on. In 1904, Los Angeles established the nation's first land-use restrictions for a portion of the city. New York City adopted the first zoning regulations to apply city-wide in 1916.\nThe constitutionality of zoning ordinances was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1926 case \"Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co.\" Among large populated cities in the United States, Houston is unique in having no zoning ordinances. The city instead has a proliferation of private deed restrictions and retains government regulations like minimum lot size and setbacks. \nScale.\nEarly zoning practices were subtle and often debated. Some claim the practices started in the 1920s while others suggest the birth of zoning occurred in New York in 1916. Both of these examples for the start of zoning, however, were urban cases. Zoning becomes an increasing legal force as it continues to expand in its geographical range through its introduction in other urban centres and use in larger political and geographical boundaries. Regional zoning was the next step in increased geographical size of areas under zoning laws. A major difference between urban zoning and regional zoning was that \"regional areas consequently seldom bear direct relationship to arbitrary political boundaries\". This form of zoning also included rural areas which was counter-intuitive to the theory that zoning was a result of population density. Finally, zoning also expanded again but back to a political boundary again with state zoning.\nTypes in use in the United States.\nUse-based zoning, especially single-use zoning, is by far the most common type of zoning in the US, where it is known as Euclidean zoning, after Euclid, Ohio's role in a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case, \"Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.\"\nSingle-use zoning in the United States.\nSingle-use zoning takes two forms, flat and hierarchical, also known as cumulative or pyramidal. Under flat zoning, each district is strictly designated for one use. In a simple hierarchical zoning system, districts are organized with residential (the most sensitive and least disruptive category) at the top, followed by commercial and industrial. Residential and commercial buildings are allowed in industrial zones and residential buildings are allowed in commercial zones. More complex hierarchical systems account for multiple levels within categories, such as multiple types of residential buildings in multifamily residential districts.130 Hierarchical zoning generally fell out of favor in the United States in the mid-twentieth century, with flat zoning becoming more popular, although many municipalities still incorporate some degree of hierarchy in their zoning ordinances.65\nSingle-use zoning is used by many municipalities due to its ease of implementation (one set of explicit, prescriptive rules), long-established legal precedent, and familiarity to planners and design professionals. Single-use zoning has been criticized, however, for its lack of flexibility. Separation of uses can contribute to urban sprawl, loss of open space, heavy infrastructure costs, and automobile dependency. In particular, single-family zoning, residential districts where only single-family homes can be built, has been widely criticized as a cause of sprawl and racial segregation.\nSocial problems in the United States.\nThe United States suffers from greater levels of deurbanization and urban decay than other developed countries, and additional problems such as urban prairies that do not occur elsewhere. Jonathan Rothwell has argued that zoning encourages racial segregation. He claims a strong relationship exists between an area's allowance of building housing at higher density and racial integration between blacks and whites in the United States. The relationship between segregation and density is explained by Rothwell and Massey as the restrictive density zoning producing higher housing prices in white areas and limiting opportunities for people with modest incomes to leave segregated areas. Between 1980 and 2000, racial integration occurred faster in areas that did not have strict density regulations than those that did. Rothwell and Massey suggest homeowners and business interests are the two key players in density regulations that emerge from a political economy. They propose that in older states where rural jurisdictions are primarily composed of homeowners, it is the narrow interests of homeowners to block development because tax rates are lower in rural areas, and taxation is more likely to fall on the median homeowner. Business interests are unable to counteract the homeowners' interests in rural areas because business interests are weaker and business ownership is rarely controlled by people living outside the community. This translates into rural communities that have a tendency to resist development by using density regulations to make business opportunities less attractive. Density zoning regulations in the U.S increase residential segregation in metropolitan areas by reducing the availability of affordable housing in some jurisdictions; other zoning regulations like school infrastructure regulations and growth controls are also variables associated with higher segregation. With more permissive zoning regulations there are lower levels of segregation; desegregation is higher in places with more liberal regulations on zoning, allowing the residents to integrate racially. Metropolitan areas that allowed higher density development moved rapidly toward racial integration than their counterparts with strict density limitations. The greater the allowable density, the lower the level of racial segregation.\nZoning laws that limit the construction of new housing (like single-family zoning) are associated with reduced affordability and are a major factor in residential segregation in the United States by income and race.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Champerty is an aggravated form of maintenance. The distinguishing feature of champerty is the support of litigation by a stranger in return for a share of the proceeds.\"\nAt common law, maintenance and champerty were both crimes and torts, as was barratry (the bringing of vexatious litigation). This is generally no longer so as, during the nineteenth century, the development of legal ethics tended to obviate the risks to the public, particularly after the scandal of the Swynfen will case (1856\u20131864). However, the principles are relevant to modern contingent fee agreements between a lawyer and a client and to the assignment by a plaintiff of his rights in a lawsuit to someone with no connection to the case. Champertous contracts, such as third-party litigation funding agreements, can still, depending on jurisdiction, be void for public policy or attract liability for costs.\nHistory.\nThe restrictions arose to combat abuses in medieval England. Unscrupulous nobles and royal officials would lend their names to bolster the credibility of doubtful and fraudulent claims in return for a share of the property recovered. Speaking extrajudicially in the early seventeenth century, Lord Chief Justice Coke described the origins of maintenance in this way:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Maintenance, \"manutenentia\", is derived from the verb \"manutenere\", and signifieth in law a taking in hand, bearing up, or upholding of quarrels and sides, to the disturbance or hindrance of common right.\nThe comments were made in context of the court previously having been anxious to prevent a wide range of maintenance; the term \"maintenance\" had been used to apply not just to those who gave support in civil claims, but also to those who sought to maintain robbers, heretics and even \"a new sect coming from beyond the sea, clad in white garments\". Judicial independence was gradually established, however, and by the early 19th century Jeremy Bentham wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A mischief, in those times it seems but too common, though a mischief not to be cured by such laws, was, that a man would buy a weak claim, in hopes that power might convert it into a strong one, and that the sword of a baron, stalking into court with a rabble of retainers at his heels, might strike terror into the eyes of a judge upon the bench. At present, what cares an English judge for the swords of a hundred barons? Neither fearing nor hoping, hating nor loving, the judge of our days is ready with equal phlegm to administer, upon all occasions, that system, whatever it be, of justice or injustice, which the law has put into his hands.\nBy jurisdiction.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, champerty and maintenance as common law causes of action (as either a crime or a tort) have mostly been abolished by statute. \nIn New South Wales, champerty and maintenance were abolished by the Maintenance, Champerty and Barratry Abolition Act 1993. \nIn Victoria, champerty and maintenance was abolished as a tort by section 32 of the Wrongs Act 1958, and as a crime by section 332A of the Crimes Act 1958.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, the common law crimes of champerty and maintenance were abolished, alongside all remaining common law offences except contempt of court, by the 1953 consolidation of the Criminal Code. However, champerty and maintenance remain torts in some Canadian jurisdictions.\nIn Ontario, champertous agreements are invalid under the Champerty Act, RSO 1897, c. 327.\nEngland and Wales.\nMaintenance and champerty have not been crimes or torts since the passing of the Criminal Law Act 1967. However, the 1967 Act stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; The abolition of criminal and civil liability under the law of England and Wales for maintenance and champerty shall not affect any rule of that law as to the cases in which a contract is to be treated as contrary to public policy or otherwise illegal. \u2014\u200a\nThere are circumstances in which a non-party who funds litigation can be liable for costs, if the action fails.\nFor instance, in \"Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd\" the Court of Appeal reincarnated the tort against the assignment of a wrongful trading claim by a liquidator to a specialist litigation company to pursuing directors for wrongful trading. This has come under criticism given that claims against directors are enforced sub-optimally as company liquidators, typically accountants, are cautious to take on risks rather than save as much of the company as possible.\nHong Kong.\nIn Hong Kong, champerty and maintenance were long thought to be obsolete both as a crime and a tort, but these two principles have been revived in recent years in response to the prevalence of recovery agents which present problems quite different from the mischief which historically these rules intended to combat.\nThe recovery agents typically perform \"ambulance chasing\" on accident victims, offering to arrange lawyers to handle their claims on a \"no win no fee\" basis. If the claim succeeds the recovery agents share a portion of the damages. This is seen as deception on uneducated victims who are ignorant to the availability of legal aid. The division of the damages in effect deprives the victims of the just compensation that they are entitled to for their bodily injury. The intermeddling of recovery agents in the lawsuit also presents ethical problems to lawyers, who may have undermined impartiality in advising on settlement. In response, the Department of Justice and the Law Society of Hong Kong carried out a massive publicity campaign aiming at educating the public to refuse recovery agents, citing that maintenance and champerty are criminal offences under the laws of Hong Kong.\nIn 2008, 21 people were arrested for champerty, maintenance and conspiracy. They were recovery agents \"helping\" accident victims on a \"no win no fee\" basis. One of the people arrested was a lawyer. Champerty and maintenance carries a sentence of up to seven years in Hong Kong.\nOn 25 June 2009, Winnie Lo Wai Yan, a solicitor, was convicted for conspiracy to maintain and a recovery agent was convicted for conspiracy to champer. She was found to have agreed to share 25% from the damages paid to the next friend of an 18-year-old traffic accident victim who suffered from permanent total loss of earning capacity. On 10 July 2009, Lo was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment and the recovery agent was sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment (Case number: DCCC 610/2008). Lo appealed in the same year and on 3 December 2010, her appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (Case number: CACC 254/2009).\nOn 30 January 2012, Lo's conviction was quashed in the Court of Final Appeal (Case number: FACC 2/2011). The Reasons for Judgment, published on 23 February 2012, stated that there is a serious problem with the finding made and endorsed by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal respectively that Lo knew that there had been champerty involved. Although the judge found maintenance and champerty are constitutional, he questioned whether criminal liability for maintenance should be retained in Hong Kong as liability for both maintenance and champerty were abolished in places such as England and South Australia.\nOn 26 March 2013, Louie Mui Kwok-keung, a barrister, was sentenced in the District Court to 3.5 years of imprisonment. He pleaded not guilty on 18 February 2013, to five counts of champerty and maintenance, allegedly committed between 1999 and 2008. He was the first barrister in the city to be convicted of such crimes (Case number: DCCC 890/2012).\nIreland.\nThe Maintenance and Embracery Act 1634 passed by the Parliament of Ireland provides that \"all statutes heretofore made in England concerning maintenance, champerty and embracery, or any of them now standing and being in their full strength and force, shall be put in due execution in this realme of Ireland\". Poynings' Law had already imported all English statutes up to 1495; the 1634 act additionally imported the Maintenance and Embracery Act 1540. The 1634 and 1540 acts are still in force in the Republic of Ireland. In 2015 Persona Digital Telephony Ltd and Sigma Wireless Networks Ltd, which lost to Esat Digifone in a 1997 telecoms bidding process criticised by the Moriarty Tribunal, applied to launch a lawsuit against those involved in the 1997 bidding, to be funded by a UK company, Harbour Litigation Funding, in return for part of any damages awarded. In 2016, the High Court ruled that such third-party funding constituted champerty prohibited by the 1634 act; Persona said it would have to drop the case, being unable to afford the \u20ac10m expenses.\nNew Zealand.\nMaintenance and champerty are torts, not crimes, under New Zealand law. Despite calls for their abolition, the New Zealand Law Commission recommended their preservation in a 2001 report titled \"Subsidising Litigation\".\nUnited States.\nThis concept exists in American jurisprudence but is disdained by \"fans of entrepreneurial lawyering in the academy and elsewhere\". There has been recent common usage of the term in the media in Nevada and Ohio. In \"NAACP v. Button\", laws that overburden free speech rights in the name of preventing champerty were found to be unconstitutional. Courts in Florida have found that the causes of action for maintenance and champerty are no longer viable in Florida, but have been superseded by laws related to abuse of process, malicious prosecution, and wrongful initiation of litigation. Florida courts have held that champerty and maintenance may continue to exist as affirmative defenses, but only as to the enforceability of the champertous contract itself.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "56315", "revid": "41042136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56315", "title": "Mango", "text": "Tropical fruit\nA mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree \"Mangifera indica\". It originated in the northeastern part of the Indian subcontinent, in what is now Bangladesh, northeastern India and Myanmar. \"M. indica\" has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times, resulting in two modern mango cultivars: the \"Indian\" and the \"Southeast Asian\" types. Other species in the genus \"Mangifera\" also produce edible fruits called \"mangoes,\" most of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.\nThere are several hundred cultivars of mango worldwide. Depending on the cultivar, mango fruit varies in size, shape, sweetness, skin color, and flesh color, which may be pale yellow, gold, green, or orange. Mango is the national fruit of India, Pakistan, and the Philippines, while the mango tree is the national tree of Bangladesh.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nThe English word \"mango\" (plural \"mangoes\" or \"mangos\") originated in the 16th century from the Portuguese word , from the Malay , and ultimately from the Tamil (, 'mango tree') + (, 'unripe fruit/vegetable') or the Malayalam (, 'mango tree') + (, 'unripe fruit'). The scientific name, \"Mangifera indica\", refers to a plant bearing mangoes in India.\nDescription.\nMango trees grow to tall, with a crown radius of . The trees are long-lived, as some specimens still fruit after 300 years.\nIn deep soil, the taproot descends to a depth of , with profuse, wide-spreading feeder roots and anchor roots penetrating deeply into the soil. The leaves are evergreen, alternate, simple, long, and broad; when the leaves are young they are orange-pink, rapidly changing to a dark, glossy red, then dark green as they mature. The flowers are produced in terminal panicles long; each flower is small and white with five petals long, with a mild, sweet fragrance. Over 500 varieties of mangoes are known, many of which ripen in summer, while some give a double crop. The fruit takes four to five months from flowering to ripening.\nThe ripe fruit varies according to cultivar in size, shape, color, sweetness, and eating quality. Depending on the cultivar, fruits are variously yellow, orange, red, or green. The fruit has a single flat, oblong pit that can be fibrous or hairy on the surface and does not separate easily from the pulp. The fruits may be somewhat round, oval, or kidney-shaped, ranging from in length and from to in weight per individual fruit. The skin is leather-like, waxy, smooth, and fragrant, with colors ranging from green to yellow, yellow-orange, yellow-red, or blushed with various shades of red, purple, pink, or yellow when fully ripe.\nRipe intact mangoes give off a distinctive resinous, sweet smell. Inside the pit thick is a thin lining covering a single seed, long. Mangoes have recalcitrant seeds which do not survive freezing and drying. Mango trees grow readily from seeds, with germination success highest when seeds are obtained from mature fruits.\nTaxonomy.\nMangoes originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. The mango is considered an evolutionary anachronism, whereby seed dispersal was once accomplished by a now-extinct evolutionary forager, such as a megafauna mammal.\nFrom their center of origin, mangoes diverged into two genetically distinct populations: the subtropical Indian group and the tropical Southeast Asian group. The Indian group is characterized by having monoembryonic fruits, while polyembryonic fruits characterize the Southeast Asian group.\nIt was previously believed that mangoes originated from a single domestication event in South Asia before being spread to Southeast Asia, but a 2019 study found no evidence of a center of diversity in India. Instead, it identified a higher unique genetic diversity in Southeast Asian cultivars than in Indian cultivars, indicating that mangoes may have originally been domesticated first in Southeast Asia before being introduced to South Asia. However, the authors also cautioned that the diversity in Southeast Asian mangoes might be the result of other reasons (like interspecific hybridization with other \"Mangifera\" species native to the Malesian ecoregion). Nevertheless, the existence of two distinct genetic populations also identified by the study indicates that the domestication of the mango is more complex than previously assumed and would at least indicate multiple domestication events in Southeast Asia and South Asia.\nCultivars.\nThere are hundreds of named mango cultivars. In mango orchards, several cultivars are often grown to improve pollination. Many desired cultivars are monoembryonic and must be propagated by grafting, or they do not breed true. A common monoembryonic cultivar is 'Alphonso', an important export product, considered \"the king of mangoes\".\nCultivars that excel in one climate may fail elsewhere. For example, Indian cultivars such as 'Julie,' a prolific cultivar in Jamaica, require annual fungicide treatments to escape the lethal fungal disease anthracnose in Florida. Asian mangoes are resistant to anthracnose.\nThe current western market is dominated by the cultivar 'Tommy Atkins', a seedling of 'Haden' that first fruited in 1940 in southern Florida and was initially rejected commercially by Florida researchers. Growers and importers worldwide have embraced the cultivar for its excellent productivity and disease resistance, shelf life, transportability, size, and appealing color. Although the Tommy Atkins cultivar is commercially successful, other cultivars may be preferred by consumers for eating pleasure, such as Alphonso.\nGenerally, ripe mangoes have an orange-yellow or reddish peel and are juicy for eating, while exported fruit are often picked while underripe with green peels. Although producing ethylene while ripening, unripened exported mangoes do not have the same juiciness or flavor as fresh fruit.\nDistribution and habitat.\nFrom tropical Asia, mangoes were introduced to East Africa by Arab and Persian traders in the ninth to tenth centuries. The 14th-century Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta reported it at Mogadishu. It was spread further into other areas around the world during the Colonial Era. The Portuguese Empire spread the mango from their colony in Goa to East and West Africa. From West Africa, they introduced it to Brazil from the 16th to the 17th centuries. From Brazil, it spread northwards to the Caribbean and eastern Mexico by the mid to late 18th century. The Spanish Empire also introduced mangoes directly from the Philippines to western Mexico via the Manila galleons from at least the 16th century. Mangoes were only introduced to Florida by 1833.\nCultivation.\nThe mango is now cultivated in most frost-free tropical and warmer subtropical climates. It is cultivated extensively in South Asia, Southeast Asia, East and West Africa, the tropical and subtropical Americas, and the Caribbean. Mangoes are also grown in Andalusia, Spain (mainly in M\u00e1laga province), as its coastal subtropical climate is one of the few places in mainland Europe that permits the growth of tropical plants and fruit trees. The Canary Islands are another notable Spanish producer of the fruit. Other minor cultivators include North America (in South Florida and the California Coachella Valley), Hawai'i, and Australia.\nMany commercial cultivars grown in Europe are grafted onto the cold-hardy rootstock of the \"Gomera-1\" mango cultivar, originally from Cuba. Its root system is well adapted to a coastal Mediterranean climate. Many of the 1,000+ mango cultivars are easily cultivated using grafted saplings, ranging from the \"turpentine mango\" (named for its strong taste of turpentine) to the Bullock's Heart. Dwarf or semidwarf varieties serve as ornamental plants and can be grown in containers. A wide variety of diseases can afflict mangoes. Spongy tissue, a ripening disorder correlated with calcium deficiency and characterized by spongy, brown-black flesh beginning near the seeds, was estimated in 1989 to affect approximately 30% of Alphonso mangoes.\nA breakthrough in mango cultivation was the use of potassium nitrate and ethrel to induce flowering in mangoes. The discovery was made by Filipino horticulturist Ramon Barba in 1974 and was developed from the unique traditional method of inducing mango flowering using smoke in the Philippines. It allowed mango plantations to induce regular flowering and fruiting year-round. Previously, mangoes were seasonal because they only flowered every 16 to 18 months. The method is now used in most mango-producing countries.\nProduction.\nIn 2023, world production of mangoes (report includes mangosteens and guavas) was 61 million tonnes, led by India with 43% of the total, and Indonesia and China as secondary producers (table).\nUses.\nCulinary.\nMangoes are generally sweet, although the taste and texture of the flesh vary across cultivars; some, such as Alphonso, have a soft, pulpy, juicy texture similar to an overripe plum, while others, such as Tommy Atkins, are firmer with a fibrous texture.\nThe skin of unripe, pickled, or cooked mango can be eaten, but it has the potential to cause contact dermatitis of the lips, gingiva, or tongue in susceptible people.\nMangoes are used in many cuisines. Sour, unripe mangoes are used in chutneys (i.e., mango chutney), pickles, daals and other side dishes in Indian cuisine. A summer drink called \"aam panna\" is made with mangoes. Mango pulp made into jelly or cooked with red gram \"dhal\" and green chilies may be served with cooked rice. Mango lassi is consumed throughout South Asia, prepared by mixing ripe mangoes or mango pulp with buttermilk and sugar. Ripe mangoes are also used to make curries. \"Aamras\" is a thick juice made of mangoes with sugar or milk and is consumed with \"chapatis\" or \"pooris\". The pulp from ripe mangoes is also used to make jam called \"mangada\". \" Andhra aavakaaya\" is a pickle made from raw, unripe, pulpy, and sour mango mixed with chili powder, fenugreek seeds, mustard powder, salt, and groundnut oil. Mango is also used to make \"dahl\" and \"chunda\" (a sweet and spicy, grated mango delicacy). In Indonesian cuisine, unripe mango is processed into \"asinan\", \"rujak\" and \"sambal pencit/mangga muda\", or eaten with edible salt.\nMangoes are used to make \"murabba\" (fruit preserves), \"muramba\" (a sweet, grated mango delicacy), \"amchur\" (dried and powdered unripe mango), and pickles, including a spicy mustard-oil pickle and alcohol. Ripe mangoes are cut into thin layers, desiccated, folded, and then cut. The fruit is also added to cereal products such as muesli and oat granola.\nMango is used to make juices, smoothies, ice cream, fruit bars, \"raspados\", \"aguas frescas\", pies, and sweet chili sauce, or mixed with \"chamoy\", a sweet and spicy chili paste. In Central America, mango is either eaten green, mixed with salt, vinegar, black pepper, and hot sauce, or ripe in various forms.\nPieces of mango can be mashed and used as a topping on ice cream or blended with milk and ice as milkshakes. Sweet glutinous rice is flavored with coconut, then served with sliced mango as mango sticky rice. In other parts of Southeast Asia, mangoes are pickled with fish sauce and rice vinegar. Green mangoes can be used in mango salad with fish sauce and dried shrimp. Mango with condensed milk may be used as a topping for shaved ice.\nRaw green mangoes can be sliced and eaten like a salad. In most parts of Southeast Asia, they are commonly eaten with fish sauce, vinegar, soy sauce, or with a dash of salt (plain or spicy)\u00a0\u2013 a combination usually known as \"mango salad\" in English.\nIn the Philippines, green mangoes are also commonly eaten with \"bagoong\" (salty fish or shrimp paste), salt, soy sauce, vinegar, or chilis. Mango float and mango cake, which use slices of ripe mangoes, are eaten in the Philippines. Dried strips of sweet, ripe mango (sometimes combined with seedless tamarind to form \"mangorind\") are also consumed. Mangoes may be used to make juices, mango nectar, and as a flavoring and major ingredient in mango ice cream and \"sorbetes\".\nPhytochemistry.\nNumerous phytochemicals are present in mango peel and pulp, such as the triterpene lupeol. Mango peel pigments under study include carotenoids, such as the provitamin\u00a0A compound, beta-carotene, lutein and alpha-carotene, and polyphenols, such as quercetin, kaempferol, gallic acid, caffeic acid, catechins and tannins. Mango contains a unique xanthonoid called mangiferin.\nPhytochemical and nutrient content appears to vary across mango cultivars. Up to 25 different carotenoids have been isolated from mango pulp, the densest of which was beta-carotene, which accounts for the yellow-orange pigmentation of most mango cultivars. Mango leaves also have significant polyphenol content, including xanthonoids, mangiferin and gallic acid.\nFlavor.\nThe flavor of mango fruits is conferred by several volatile organic chemicals mainly belonging to terpene, furanone, lactone, and ester classes. Different varieties or cultivars of mangoes can have flavors made up of different volatile chemicals or the same volatile chemicals in different quantities. In general, New World mango cultivars are characterized by the dominance of \u03b4-3-carene, a monoterpene flavorant; whereas, high concentration of other monoterpenes such as (Z)-ocimene and myrcene, as well as the presence of lactones and furanones, is the unique feature of Old World cultivars. In India, 'Alphonso' is one of the most popular cultivars. In 'Alphonso' mango, the lactones, and furanones are synthesized during ripening, whereas terpenes and the other flavorants are present in both the developing (immature) and ripening fruits. Ethylene, a ripening-related hormone well known to be involved in ripening of mango fruits, causes changes in the flavor composition of mango fruits upon exogenous application, as well. In contrast to the huge amount of information available on the chemical composition of mango flavor, the biosynthesis of these chemicals has not been studied in depth; only a handful of genes encoding the enzymes of flavor biosynthetic pathways have been characterized to date.\nToxicity.\nContact with oils in mango leaves, stems, sap, and skin can cause dermatitis and anaphylaxis in susceptible individuals. Those with a history of contact dermatitis induced by urushiol (an allergen found in poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac) may be most at risk for mango contact dermatitis. Other mango compounds potentially responsible for dermatitis or allergic reactions include mangiferin. Cross-reactions may occur between mango allergens and urushiol. Sensitized individuals may not be able to eat peeled mangoes or drink mango juice safely.\nWhen mango trees are flowering in spring, local people with allergies may experience breathing difficulty, itching of the eyes, or facial swelling, even before flower pollen becomes airborne. In this case, the irritant is likely to be the vaporized essential oil from flowers. During the primary ripening season of mangoes, contact with mango plant parts \u2013 primarily sap, leaves, and fruit skin \u2013 is the most common cause of plant dermatitis in Hawaii.\nNutrition.\nA raw mango is 84% water, 15% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and has negligible fat (table). In a reference amount of , raw mango supplies 60 calories and is a rich source of vitamin C (40% of the Daily Value, DV) with moderate amounts of folate (11% DV) and copper (12% DV), while other micronutrients are low in content (table).\nCulture.\nThe mango is the national fruit of India. It is also the national tree of Bangladesh. In India, harvest and sale of mangoes is during March\u2013May and this is annually covered by news agencies.\nThe mango has a traditional context in the culture of South Asia. In his edicts, the Mauryan emperor Ashoka references the planting of fruit- and shade-bearing trees along imperial roads:\n\"On the roads banyan-trees were caused to be planted by me, (in order that) they might afford shade to cattle and men, (and) mango-groves were caused to be planted.\"\nIn medieval India, the Indo-Persian poet Amir Khusrau termed the mango \"Naghza Tarin Mewa Hindustan\" \u2013 \"the fairest fruit of Hindustan\". Mangoes were enjoyed at the court of the Delhi Sultan Alauddin Khijli. The Mughal Empire was especially fond of the fruits: Babur praises the mango in his \"Babarnameh\". At the same time, Sher Shah Suri inaugurated the creation of the Chaunsa variety after his victory over the Mughal emperor Humayun. Mughal patronage of horticulture led to the grafting of thousands of mangoes varieties, including the famous Totapuri, which was the first variety to be exported to Iran and Central Asia. Akbar (1556\u20131605) is said to have planted a mango orchard of 100,000 trees near Darbhanga, Bihar, while Jahangir and Shah Jahan ordered the planting of mango orchards in Lahore and Delhi and the creation of mango-based desserts.\nThe Jain goddess Ambika is traditionally represented as sitting under a mango tree. Mango blossoms are also used in the worship of the goddess Saraswati. Mango leaves decorate archways and doors in Indian houses during weddings and celebrations such as Ganesh Chaturthi. Mango motifs and paisleys are widely used in different Indian embroidery styles, and are found in Kashmiri shawls, Kanchipuram and silk sarees. In Tamil Nadu, the mango is referred to as one of the three royal fruits, along with banana and jackfruit, for their sweetness and flavor. This triad of fruits is referred to as \"ma-pala-vazhai\". The classical Sanskrit poet Kalidasa sang the praises of mangoes.\nMangoes were the subject of the mango cult in China during the Cultural Revolution as symbols of chairman Mao Zedong's love for the people.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Mangoes| ]]\n[[Category:Crops]]\n[[Category:Fruits originating in Asia]]\n[[Category:Indian spices]]\n[[Category:Medicinal plants]]\n[[Category:National symbols of Bangladesh]]\n[[Category:National symbols of Pakistan]]\n[[Category:South Asian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Southeast Asian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Drupes]]\n[[Category:Edible fruits]]"}

It has a history of cultivation originating in the Harar area (present day eastern Ethiopia) and subsequently introduced at different times to countries nearby in East Africa and Southern Arabia, most notably Yemen. Cultivated by farmers, its leaves are sold on the market to be chewed as a recreational stimulant. The world's largest consumers are Eastern Africans, particularly Somalis, and nearby Yemen, with the largest producers/exporters being Ethiopia and Kenya.\nKhat contains the alkaloid \"cathinone\", a stimulant which causes greater sociability, excitement, mild loss of appetite and mild euphoria. Among communities from the areas where the plant is native, khat-chewing has historical relevance (as a social custom, especially among men) dating back thousands of years, analogous\u2014but slightly different\u2014to the use of coca leaves in South America's Andes Mountains or the betel nut preparations in South Asia.\nSince 1980, the World Health Organization (WHO) classifies khat as a \"drug of abuse\" that can produce psychological dependence, although the WHO does not consider khat addiction to be a serious global problem.\nThe legality of khat varies by region and country; in many territories, khat might pass \"under-the-radar\" as a botanical species (thus not be a specifically controlled substance), but its recreational use may, nevertheless, be illegal under more general laws. It is strictly a controlled substance in many regions, often at the highest degree, including in Australia, Canada, the European Union, India, Jordan, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United Kingdom (UK). In the United States (US) and Turkey, the botanical specimen (plant) \"Catha edulis\" is not prohibited, but the consumption and distribution of harvested leaves or possession for recreational use is illegal. In the UAE, the punishment for possession, use, or distribution of khat can include life imprisonment. By contrast, its production, sale, and consumption are all fully legal\u2014or not mentioned in a legal context at all\u2014in the nations where its use is culturally significant, including Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Uganda and Yemen. In Israel, which hosts a population of Yemenite Jews, only the consumption of the plant's leaves in its natural state is permitted; \"khat extracts\" are illegal, after they became a street drug and were popularly abused in the 2000s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNomenclature.\nThe genus name \"Catha\" is a Latinization of the Arabic name , which is regularly romanized as \"q\u0101t\". Other romanizations include \"kat\", \"quatt\", \"qaad\", \"qhat\", \"ghat\", and \"chat\".\nThe khat plant is known by a variety of names, such as \"qat\" and \"gat\" in Yemeni Arabic, \"qaat\" and \"jaad\" in Somali, and \"chat\" in Harari and Amharic. It is also known as \"jimaa\" in the Oromo language, \"mayirungi\" in Luganda, and as \"miraa\" and \"muguka\" in Swahili. In the African Great Lakes region, where \"Catha edulis\" is (in some areas) cultivated, it is known as \"miraa\", \"muhulo\", \"muguka\" and \"muirungi\".\nIt also goes by various descriptive names, such as \"Abyssinian tea\", \"Arabian tea\", \"kafta\", \"jimaa\", and \"Somalian tea\" in its endemic regions of the Horn of Africa and the Arabian peninsula. In South Africa, the plant is known as \"Bushman's tea\". The plant is also known as \"chat tree\" and \"flower of paradise\".\nVernacular names.\nIn the Indian subcontinent, \"Catha edulis\" is sometimes referred to by its Unani name \"Kat\" or \"Qaat\" in traditional texts.\nDescription.\nKhat is a slow-growing shrub or tree that typically attains a height of . However, it can reach heights of up to in equatorial areas. The plant usually grows in arid environments, at a temperature range of . It has evergreen leaves, which are long and broad.\nIt takes seven to eight years for the khat plant to reach its full height. Other than access to sun and water, khat requires little maintenance. Ground water is often pumped from deep wells by diesel engines to irrigate the crops, or brought in by water trucks. The plants are watered heavily starting around a month before they are harvested to make the leaves and stems soft and moist. A good khat plant can be harvested four times a year, providing a year-long source of income for the farmer.\nThe shrub's flowers are produced on short axillary cymes that are in length. Each flower is small, with five white petals.\nThe samara fruit is an oblong, three-valved capsule, which contains one to three seeds.\nSociety and culture.\nCultivation.\nKhat has been grown for use as a stimulant for centuries in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian peninsula. There, chewing khat predates the use of coffee and is used in a similar social context. Its fresh leaves and tops are chewed or, less frequently, dried and consumed as tea, to achieve a state of euphoria and stimulation. The leaves or the soft part of the stem can be chewed with either chewing gum or fried peanuts to make it easier to chew.\nIn Uganda, it is grown in the central region, especially in Kasenge (Wakiso), Butambala District, Mabira Forest, and in some parts of the western region of the country. In Kenya, it is grown in Meru County and Embu County.\nOne reason for the widespread cultivation of khat in Yemen is the high income that it provides for farmers. Some studies done in 2001 estimated that the income from cultivating khat was about 2.5\u00a0million Yemeni rials per hectare, while fruits brought only 0.57\u00a0million rials per hectare. Between 1970 and 2000, the area on which khat was cultivated was estimated to have grown from 8,000 to 103,000 hectares. In 2000, according to a World Bank estimate, khat accounted for 30% of Yemen's economy.\nUses.\nAlthough the practice of khat-chewing is still primarily restricted to its original area of cultivation in the Red Sea area, the khat plant is native to the whole of the eastern side of Africa from Kenya southwards to Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, where it grows on rocky outcrops and around the fringes of woodlands. In southern Africa the shrub's range is scattered but still grows in the KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa, in addition to Eswatini and Mozambique.\nTraditionally, khat is used as a socialising drug as in Yemen, where khat-chewing is predominantly a male habit combined with conversation, hookah smoking, and tea drinking. Khat is so popular in Yemen that its cultivation consumes much of the country's agricultural resources. An estimated 40% of Yemen's water supply goes towards irrigating it, with production increasing by about 10% to 15% every year. One \"daily bag\" of khat requires an estimated of water to produce. Water consumption is high and groundwater levels in the Sana'a basin are diminishing, so government officials have proposed relocating large portions of the population of the city to the Red Sea coastal areas.\nIn countries outside the core area of growth and consumption, khat is sometimes chewed at parties or social functions. It may also be used by farmers and labourers for reducing physical fatigue or hunger, and by drivers and students for improving attention.\nMore recently, in 2019, reports indicate that child soldiers in Yemen have been chewing khat in order to remain alert on the battlefield.\nDistribution.\nIn recent years, improved roads, off-road motor vehicles, and air transportation have increased the global distribution of this perishable commodity and, as a result, the plant has been found in places such as Australia, Netherlands, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Levant, Rome (Italy), New Zealand and the United States. In the US, freshly-packed khat leaves are sold in the African and Middle Eastern markets of Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles, and New York City, where the demand is highest.\nEffects.\nKhat consumption induces mild euphoria and excitement, similar to that conferred by strong coffee. Individuals become very talkative under the influence of the plant. Animal testing has shown that khat causes an increase in motoric activity. The effects of oral administration of cathinone occur more rapidly than the effects of amphetamine pills; roughly 15 minutes as compared to 30 minutes in amphetamine. Khat can induce manic behaviours and hyperactivity, similar in effects to those produced by amphetamine.\nThe use of khat results in constipation. Dilated pupils (mydriasis) are prominent during khat consumption, reflecting the sympathomimetic effects of the drug, which are also reflected in increased heart rate and blood pressure. Long-term use can precipitate permanent tooth darkening (of a greenish tinge), susceptibility to ulcers, and diminished sex drive. Khat is an effective anorectic, causing loss of appetite.\nIt is unclear if the consumption of khat directly affects the mental health of the user or not. Occasionally, a psychotic episode can result, resembling a hypomanic state in presentation. In humans, its prolonged consumption creates an uplifted mood and a sense of release from time and space.\nKhat is mainly chewed by men, but there are cases of its use by women, and in particular it has been associated with increased likelihood of adverse outcomes during pregnancy.\nEffects by timeframe.\nImmediate\nLong-term\nIndeterminate\nChemistry and pharmacology.\nThe stimulant effect of the plant was originally attributed to \"katin\", cathine, a phenethylamine-type substance isolated from the plant. However, the attribution was disputed by reports showing the plant extracts from fresh leaves contained another substance more behaviourally active than cathine. In 1975, the related alkaloid cathinone was isolated, and its absolute configuration, (S)-2-Amino-1-phenylpropan-1-one, was established in 1978. Cathinone is not very stable and breaks down to produce cathine and norephedrine. These chemicals belong to the PPA (phenylpropanolamine) family, a subset of the phenethylamines related to amphetamines and the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine. In fact, cathinone and cathine have a very similar molecular structure to amphetamine. Khat is sometimes confused with methcathinone (also known as \"cat\"), a Schedule I substance that possesses a similar chemical structure to the khat plant's cathinone active component. However, both the side effects and the addictive properties of methcathinone are much stronger than those associated with khat use.\nWhen khat leaves dry, the more potent chemical, cathinone, decomposes within 48 hours, leaving behind the milder chemical, cathine. Thus, harvesters transport khat by packaging the fresh leaves and stems in plastic bags or wrapping them in banana leaves to preserve their moisture and keep the cathinone potent. It is also common for them to sprinkle the plant with water frequently or use refrigeration during transportation.\nWhen the khat leaves are chewed, cathine and cathinone are released and absorbed through the mucous membranes of the mouth as well as the lining of the stomach. The action of cathine and cathinone on the reuptake of epinephrine and norepinephrine has been demonstrated in lab animals, showing that one or both of these chemicals cause(s) the body to recycle these neurotransmitters more slowly, resulting in the wakefulness and insomnia associated with khat use.\nReceptors for serotonin show a high affinity for cathinone, suggesting this chemical is responsible for feelings of euphoria associated with chewing khat. In mice, cathinone produces the same types of nervous pacing or repetitive scratching behaviours associated with amphetamines. The effects of cathinone peak after 15 to 30 minutes, with nearly 98% of the substance metabolised into norephedrine by the liver.\nCathine is somewhat less understood, being believed to act upon the adrenergic receptors causing the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine. It has a half-life of about three hours in humans. The medication bromocriptine can reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms within 24 hours.\nDemographics.\nAn estimated 5 to 10\u00a0million people globally use khat on a daily basis. It is grown principally by communities in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian peninsula, where khat-chewing has a long history as a social custom dating back thousands of years.\nThe traditional form of khat chewing in Yemen involves only male users; khat chewing by females is less formal and less frequent. Researchers estimate about 70\u201380% of Yemenis between 16 and 50 years old chew khat, at least on occasion. Approximately 60\u201390% of male and 35% of female Yemenis chew khat daily. Before Yemeni unification in 1990, khat chewing was largely confined to the north-west mountains of the country, where khat grows. Yemenis spend an estimated 14.6\u00a0million man-hours per day chewing khat. Researchers have also estimated that families spend about 17% of their income on khat.\nIn Ethiopia, khat is chewed by 19.5% of the population and is more commonly chewed by men than women.\nHistory.\nThe inhabitants of Ifat Sultanate were the first to be recorded using khat in the 14th century by Arab historian Ibn Fadlallah al-Umari. The khat plant likely originated in the Horn of Africa specifically Ethiopia-Somali area, from there it spread to Kenya and the Arabian Peninsula. According to nineteenth century British explorer Richard Burton, khat originated in the Emirate of Harar.\nMuslim Sufis in the surrounding areas also used it to intensify their mystical experience and to facilitate a sense of union with God.\nThe earliest known documented description of khat is found in the \"Kitab al-Saidala fi al-Tibb\" , an 11th-century work on pharmacy and materia medica written by Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b, a Persian scientist and biologist. Unaware of its origins, al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b wrote that khat is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[A] commodity from Turkestan. It is sour to taste and slenderly made in the manner of \"batan-alu\". But \"khat\" is reddish with a slight blackish tinge. It is believed that \"batan-alu\" is red, coolant, relieves biliousness, and is a refrigerant for the stomach and the liver.\nIt is mentioned again in a 13th-century publication by the physician Naguib Ad-Din.\nIn 1854, Malay author Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir noted that the custom of chewing khat was prevalent in Al Hudaydah in Yemen:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You observed a new peculiarity in this city\u00a0\u2013 everyone chewed leaves as goats chew the cud. There is a type of leaf, rather wide and about two fingers in length, which is widely sold, as people would consume these leaves just as they are; unlike betel leaves, which need certain condiments to go with them, these leaves were just stuffed fully into the mouth and munched. Thus when people gathered around, the remnants from these leaves would pile up in front of them. When they spat, their saliva was green. I then queried them on this matter: 'What benefits are there to be gained from eating these leaves?' To which they replied, 'None whatsoever, it's just another expense for us as we've grown accustomed to it.' Those who consume these leaves have to eat lots of ghee and honey, for they would fall ill otherwise. The leaves are known as \"Kad\".\"\nIn 1856, English writer Charles Dickens also described the custom of khat chewing in the Horn region and the adjacent Gulf territories, likening it to drinking strong green tea:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And one may sleep well if, during the day, too much kat has not been chewed. The leaves of the drug called kat are the chief source of pleasurable excitement in these districts of East Africa. Botanists, taking the native name for the plant, turn it into Catha edulis, eatable kat. It is much used by the Arabs, to whom it is sent in camel loads, consisting of a number of small parcels, each containing about forty slender twigs, with the leaves attached, carefully, wrapped so as to avoid exposure to the air. These leaves are chewed, and act upon the spirits of those using them, much as a strong dose of green tea acts upon us in Europe, when it acts agreeably. Europeans used to stronger stimulants, are little affected by the use of kat, but among the more temperate Arabs it is so welcome a provocative to good humour, that about two hundred and eighty camel-loads of it are used every year in Aden only.\nNowadays khat consumption is limited to East Africa and South Western Arabia. These countries include Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia (includes Somaliland), Uganda, and Yemen. The author Yousif Al Zarouni writes in his book:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The plant is native to the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa, despite its native grounds it is only legal in one of the several countries of the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen. The plant however is widely available and legal in East Africa, some African nations on the other hand such as South Africa consider it as a protected species.\nThe plant is mostly used by East Africans and South West Arabians, rarely by people from other places.\nFollowing a ban on khat in the British-governed Aden Protectorate, the Q\u0101t Commission of Inquiry in Aden concluded: \"Q\u0101t does not create an addiction, like opium or hashish, in that those who are suddenly deprived of it, do not suffer physical consequences.\"\nLegal status.\nIn 1965, the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on Dependence-producing Drugs' \"Fourteenth Report\" noted, \"The Committee was pleased to note the resolution of the Economic and Social Council with respect to khat, confirming the view that the abuse of this substance is a regional problem and may best be controlled at that level.\" For this reason, khat was not scheduled under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. In 1980, the WHO classified the plant as a drug of abuse that can produce mild to moderate psychological dependence (less than tobacco or alcohol), although the WHO does not consider khat to be seriously addictive. It is a controlled or illegal substance in some countries, but is legal for sale and production in others.\nAfrica.\nMorocco.\nKhat is illegal in Morocco.\nEthiopia.\nKhat is legal in Ethiopia.\nSomalia.\nKhat is legal in Somalia.\nDjibouti.\nKhat is legal in Djibouti.\nKenya.\nKhat is legal in Kenya. However, two of its active components, cathinone and cathine, are classed as Class C substances.\nSouth Africa.\nIn South Africa, \"Catha edulis\" is a protected tree.\nThe use of khat is illegal.\nUganda.\nKhat is illegal in Uganda as of 2023.\nAsia.\nBangladesh.\nKhat is illegal in Bangladesh.\nChina.\nKhat is illegal in China.\nHong Kong.\nKhat is regarded as a dangerous drug in Hong Kong. Traffickers can face a penalty up to HK$5 million as well as life imprisonment.\nTaiwan.\nIn Taiwan, khat is illegal. It is classified as a narcotic drug.\nIsrael.\nKhat, called \"Gat\" in Israel, is consumed mainly by Yemenite Jews and Beta Israel. The activity of chewing its leaves is called \"lekhazen\" (). The process of chewing the Gat can take up to several hours. Some chew the Gat in a gathering which is called \"takhazina\" (). The Gat is grown traditionally in private gardens, but it may be found in some markets.\nGat is legal in Israel as long as it is consumed in its natural form, but the distillation of its components is illegal. Some use the plant as a hedge since it is an evergreen.\nIn 2003, Hagigat, a pill based on extracted cathinone, began to be sold in kiosks in Israel. Following several cases of hospitalisation, the Israeli Ministry of Health classified cathinone as a dangerous drug, and \"Hagigat\" was outlawed. The plant itself is allowed to be chewed and sold in its natural state, as no harm was found in normal quantities.\nAs of June 2012, the Israeli anti-drug authority announced that beverages containing Khat are considered illegal as per the dangerous drug ordinance of the state of Israel.\nIndonesia.\nKhat is illegal in Indonesia.\nSaudi Arabia.\nKhat is illegal in Saudi Arabia.\nSingapore.\nKhat is prohibited in Singapore by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB).\nUnited Arab Emirates.\nKhat is illegal in the United Arab Emirates under federal law number 14 of 1995 on the Countermeasures against Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Schedule No. 4, Part 2(5) prohibits the cultivation and possession of khat. The possession and selling of khat may lead to life imprisonment.\nVietnam.\nKhat is classified as a narcotic drug in Vietnam. The illegal cultivation, possession and distribution of khat are criminally prosecuted. The use of khat may lead to mandatory rehabilitation.\nYemen.\nKhat is legal in Yemen. However, cultivation of the crop and the selling of its leaves are governed by a series of regulations. In 2007, the Yemeni government passed a law that restricted the cultivation of khat in a number of agricultural flatlands and basins with high water stress. The Law Concerning the General Sales Tax in 2005 also set the tax rate on khat at 20% of its retail price.\nThe widespread cultivation of khat in Yemen has exacerbated a severe water shortage. Khat is much more water-intensive to grow than other crops. It has also played a major role in a famine in the country.\nEurope.\nBelgium.\nKhat has been illegal in Belgium since 2006.\nDenmark.\nKhat has been illegal in Denmark since 1993. In 2009, the Danish Health Authority investigated khat use among Somalis in Denmark. A questionnaire with 848 respondents was used. The responses indicated that 48% of Somali males and 16% of females used the narcotic on a monthly basis and that 29% of males and 6% of females used it two times or more a week. Half the respondents had never used khat. The responses indicated that Somalis constituted the great majority of users in Denmark.\nThe report also investigated attitudes towards khat use among Somalis in Denmark. In total, two out of three respondents stated that khat is a problem for social integration into Danish society, while one in three users stated the same. Responses indicated that two out of three considered khat to be part of Somali culture, although two in three also stated that they agree that khat should be banned in Denmark.\nFinland.\nKhat is classified as an illegal drug in Finland, and possession, use and sale of the substance is prohibited and punishable. As with all illegal drugs, operating a motor vehicle with detectable levels of Khat or its metabolites in one's system can also lead to a conviction for driving under the influence, even if the driver does not appear intoxicated.\nFrance.\nKhat is prohibited in France as a stimulant since 1957.\nGermany.\nIn Germany, cathinone is listed as a \"non-trafficable substance\", which makes the possession, sale and purchase of fresh khat illegal. The derivative cathine, with \"norpseudoephedrine\" listed as an alternate name, is only available on prescription.\nIn 2017, 5815\u00a0kg of khat was discovered by customs officials in Frankfurt. In June 2018, 324\u00a0kg of khat was discovered in packages from East Africa.\nGreece.\nIn the Hellenic Republic, khat is classified as an illegal narcotic under Law 3459/2006 (the Code of Laws on Narcotics).\nIn August 2025, Greek customs officials at Athens International Airport seized a record 500 kilograms of khat with an estimated street value of \u20ac1.5 million, underscoring its continued prohibition and enforcement.\nIceland.\nIn August 2010 the Icelandic police intercepted khat smuggling for the first time. 37\u00a0kg were confiscated. The drugs were most likely intended for sale in Canada. Again in May 2011 the police intercepted around 60\u00a0kg.\nIreland.\nKhat is a controlled drug for the purpose of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988. As such its possession and supply is prohibited.\nItaly.\nKhat is inserted in the Table I of the Italian official list of psychoactive drugs under the name \"Catha edulis pianta\" (English: \"Catha edulis plant\") and thus possession is forbidden.\nNetherlands.\nIn the Netherlands, the active ingredients of khat, cathine and cathinone, are qualified as hard drugs and forbidden. Use is mostly limited to the Somali community. In 2008 health minister Ab Klink decided against qualifying the unprocessed plant as drugs after consultation with experts. However, on 9 January 2012 the Dutch government announced a ban on khat.\nNorway.\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n Weight of khat (in kg) confiscated by Norwegian Customs Service 2009-present. The number of confiscations was about 200\u2013350 per year.\nIn Norway, khat is classified as a narcotic drug and is illegal to use, sell and possess. Most users are Somali immigrants and khat is smuggled from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\nNorwegian Customs seized 10 metric tons of khat in 2010, an increase from less than 4 in 2006.\nIn 2016, Oslo municipality estimated 50\u201370% of Somali immigrant males to be habitual users.\nPoland.\nIn Poland, khat is a classified narcotic drug, and is illegal to use, sell and possess.\nSlovenia.\nKhat is classified as an illegal drug in Slovenia.\nSweden.\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n Khat (in kg) confiscated by the Swedish Customs Service and Swedish Police from 2000 to 2015.\nThe drug was prohibited in Sweden in 1989, without research. In 2007, it was estimated that 30% of Somali males in Sweden were using khat. Smuggling seizures by police amounted to about 9 tonnes annually.\nSwitzerland.\nIn Switzerland, khat is illegal and it is classified as a narcotic drug.\nUnited Kingdom.\nKhat was made illegal in the UK on 24 June 2014. Concerns had been expressed by commentators, health professionals and community members about the use of khat in the UK, particularly by immigrants from Somalia, Yemen and Ethiopia. Studies of the effects of khat use by immigrants on their mental health suggested that there was a need for better research on khat-chewing and its possible link with psychiatric disorders; it also suggested that public discourse on the issue displayed elements of a moral panic. Some Somali community organisations also campaigned for khat to be banned. As a result of these concerns, the Home Office commissioned successive research studies to look into the matter, and in 2005, presented the question of khat's legal status before the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. The study concluded that most of the participants who were using khat were using it moderately in terms of both the quantity used and the frequency and duration of chewing sessions, and that khat use was typically a social activity. Only a small minority of the study participants' khat use was judged to be excessive. After a careful review of the evidence, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommended in January 2006 that the status of khat as a legal substance should remain for the time being.\nIn 2008, Conservative politician Sayeeda Warsi stated that a future Conservative government would ban khat. The website of the Conservative Party, which in 2010 became the larger party in a UK coalition government, previously stated that a Conservative government would \"Tackle unacceptable cultural practices by\", amongst other measures, \"classifying Khat\". In 2009, the Home Office commissioned two new studies in the effects of khat use and in June 2010, a Home Office spokesperson stated: \"The Government is committed to addressing any form of substance misuse and will keep the issue of khat use under close scrutiny\".\nDuring a parliamentary debate on the legality issue on 11 January 2012, Mark Lancaster, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Milton Keynes, stated that the importation of Khat into the UK stands at 10 tonnes every week.\nOn 23 January 2013, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) said there was \"insufficient evidence\" that khat caused health problems. The ACMD said there was \"no evidence\" khat was directly linked with serious or organised crime, and was chewed to obtain a \"mild stimulant effect much less potent than stimulant drugs, such as amphetamine\".\nOn 3 July 2013, the British Home Secretary Theresa May announced that khat was to be banned in Britain, designating it a Class C substance under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.\nAlex Miller, a journalist from the Montreal, Canada-based magazine and television channel Vice, looked into the use of the substance and the potential impact of the ban for BBC nightly current affairs programme Newsnight and for a Vice documentary.\nKenyan MPs appealed to the UK not to \"condemn people\" by banning the herbal stimulant khat\nIn March 2014, the United Kingdom House of Commons' Home Affairs Select Committee announced that it would continue to lobby for the UK government not to go through with its intended ban on khat. The committee had shortly before also completed an inquiry and a report recommending that the British authorities refrain from banning the plant.\nOn 12 May 2014, the House of Lords passed a Motion to Approve the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Designation)(Amendment) (No. 2)(England, Wales and Scotland) Order 2014, in order to control \"Catha edulis\" as a Class C drug. An amendment was proposed stating that, \"this House regrets that Her Majesty's Government's plans for the introduction of the Order do not include provisions for a 12-month review of the impact of the reclassification of khat in view of the highly unusual community focus of its use, for putting a detailed policing strategy in place before a ban takes effect, or for a health strategy to prevent a transfer of addiction to other substances; and do not commit the Department for International Development to do more work with the government of Kenya to alleviate the effect of the reclassification on the Kenyan economy.\" However, the amendment was defeated by vote. The prohibition came into effect on 24 June 2014.\nIn January 2015, the \"Bristol Post\" reported that most khat houses in the city had closed down, \"forcing users to take the drug in their homes instead\". The local police had initially not sought to enforce the ban, giving users a grace period, but according to the \"Bristol Post\" had recently started to take action against khat use and had issued three warnings and a caution. Additionally, in September 2014 the police had seized 24 bags of dried khat from a property in Easton, but no arrests were made. Additionally, the Somali Resource Centre indicated that the ban seemed to have been effective, and that the prohibition had all but destroyed the import market since the plant has to be fresh in order to be consumed. A consultation with Somalis in Glasgow undertaken by the national voluntary organisation Fast Forward at the request of the Somali Association in Glasgow in October 2014 suggested that khat continues to be used in both fresh and dried forms by some Somalis in the city, and that the ban has also led some users to seek out other substances. The ban has reportedly served to increase the price of khat in the UK. Channel 4 News reported in September 2014 that before the ban, 20 tonnes of khat arrived at Heathrow Airport daily, and it would sell for \u00a33 per bundle. After the ban, it was reportedly selling at \u00a330 per bundle.\nNorth America.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, khat is a controlled substance under Schedule IV of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA), meaning it is illegal to seek or obtain unless approved by a medical practitioner. Possession of khat for personal use is not an arraignable offence in Canada. The maximum punishment for trafficking or possession with the intent of trafficking is ten years in prison.\nIn 2008, Canadian authorities reported that khat is the most common illegal drug being smuggled at airports.\nHowever, in 2012 the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a 2011 absolute discharge of a young woman who brought 34 kilograms of khat into Canada in 2009. According to the defence, the ruling recognises that there is no empirical evidence that khat is harmful. The courts in Quebec and Ontario continued to discharge the accused for bringing khat into Canada for the same reason (no evidence of harmfulness of khat) in 2014 and 2016.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, cathinone is a Schedule I drug, according to the US Controlled Substances Act. The 1993 DEA rule placing cathinone in Schedule I noted that it was effectively also banning khat:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Cathinone is the major psychoactive component of the plant \"Catha edulis\" (khat). The young leaves of khat are chewed for a stimulant effect. Enactment of this rule results in the placement of any material that contains cathinone into Schedule I.\n\"Catha edulis\" (khat) is a stimulant similar to that of amphetamine and its congeners, not a drug as categorised by US FDA (United States Food &amp; Drug Administration) and FDA import Alert #66-23 (published date 03/18/2011) states that \"Districts may detain, without physical examination, all entries of khat\", based on section 801(a) (3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act on the grounds that \"its labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use.\"\nAs federal and local khat raids have often targeted immigrants from countries where khat is legal, issues of cultural misunderstanding have sometimes been raised.\nThe plant itself is specifically banned in Missouri:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Khat, to include all parts of the plant presently classified botanically as catha edulis, whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; any extract from any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seed or extracts.\nIn California, both the plant itself as well as cathinone, its active component, are illegal.\nOceania.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, the importation of khat is controlled under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956. It is illegal to import khat into Australia for personal use. Khat can be imported only for medical or scientific use.\nImporting khat without a permit is subject to fines or prosecution. In 2003, the total number of khat annual permits was 294 and the total number of individual khat permits was 202; however as of 1 December 2013, permits for the use of khat by individuals for recreational/cultural purposes are no longer issued. There are currently no plans by the Australian Government to amend the regulations to allow the importation of khat for personal use.\nKhat is listed as a Schedule 2 dangerous drug in Queensland, in the same category as cannabis. In the states of Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania, khat does not appear to be regulated through criminal legislation.\nThe importation of Khat (\"Catha edulis\") material (includes material that is fresh, dried, powdered, capsules or tablets) is prohibited under the Customs (Prohibited Import) Regulations 1956 unless the person importing the material is the holder of both a license to import and a permit to import granted by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).\nNew Zealand.\nIn New Zealand, khat is listed as a Class C drug, in the same category as cannabis and codeine.\nSouth America.\nIn South America, there is no legislation regarding khat; the active ingredients in the plant can be found in several weight control compounds sold in the continent.\nBiofuel.\nThe possibility of Khat waste has been explored as a biofuel. It may be a possible future fuel, especially in developing countries. Some chemical groups that are essential for biofuel properties, such as alkene groups and O-H bonds have been found in Khat waste.\nResearch programs.\nIn 2009, the University of Minnesota launched the Khat Research Program (KRP), a multidisciplinary research and training program focusing on the neurobehavioral and health effects of khat, led by Mustafa al'Absi. The program was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute for Drug Abuse of the United States. The inaugural event for the KRP was held in Sharm El-Sheik, Egypt, in December, 2009 in collaboration with the International Brain Research Organization (IBRO) and its local affiliates.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Sometimes categorized under \"death magic\", the term is occasionally also used in a more general sense to refer to black magic or witchcraft as a whole.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"necromancy\" is adapted from Late Latin : a loan word from the post-Classical Greek (, or 'divination through a dead body'), a compound of Ancient Greek (, or 'dead body') and (, or 'divination').\nThe Koine Greek compound form was first documented in the writings of Origen of Alexandria in the 3rd century AD. The Classical Greek term was (), from the episode of the \"Odyssey\" in which Odysseus visits the realm of the dead souls, and in Hellenistic Greek; in Latin, and \"necromancy\" in 17th-century English.\nAntiquity.\nEarly necromancy was related to \u2013 and most likely evolved from \u2013 forms of shamanism or prehistoric ritual magic that calls upon spirits such as the ghosts of deceased forebears. Classical necromancers addressed the dead in \"a mixture of high-pitch squeaking and low droning\", comparable to the trance-state mutterings of shamans.\nNecromancy was prevalent throughout antiquity with records of its practice in ancient Egypt, Babylonia, Greece, ancient Etruria, Rome, and China. In his \"Geographica\", Strabo refers to (), or \"diviners by the dead\", as the foremost practitioners of divination among the people of Persia, and it is believed to have also been widespread among the peoples of Chaldea (particularly the Hermeticists, or \"star-worshipers\") and Babylonia. The Babylonian necromancers were called or , and the spirits they raised were called . \nTraditional Chinese folk religion involves necromancy in seeking blessing from dead ancestors through ritual displays of filial piety.\nThe oldest literary account of necromancy is found in Homer's \"Odyssey\". Under the direction of Circe, a powerful sorceress, Odysseus travels to the underworld () in order to gain insight about his impending voyage home by raising the spirits of the dead through the use of spells which Circe has taught him. He wishes to invoke and question the shade of Tiresias in particular; however, he is unable to summon the seer's spirit without the assistance of others. The \"Odyssey\"'s passages contain many descriptive references to necromantic rituals: rites must be performed around a pit with fire during nocturnal hours, and Odysseus has to follow a specific recipe, which includes the blood of sacrificial animals, to concoct a libation for the ghosts to drink while he recites prayers to both the ghosts and gods of the underworld.\nPractices such as these, varying from the mundane to the grotesque, were commonly associated with necromancy. Rituals could be quite elaborate, involving magic circles, wands, talismans, and incantations. The necromancer might also surround himself with morbid aspects of death, which often included wearing the deceased's clothing and consuming foods that symbolized lifelessness and decay such as unleavened black bread and unfermented grape juice. Some necromancers even went so far as to take part in the mutilation and consumption of corpses. These ceremonies could carry on for hours, days, or even weeks, leading up to the eventual summoning of spirits. Frequently they were performed in places of interment or other melancholy venues that suited specific guidelines of the necromancer. Additionally, necromancers preferred to summon the recently departed based on the premise that their revelations were spoken more clearly. This timeframe was usually limited to the twelve months following the death of the physical body; once this period elapsed, necromancers would evoke the deceased's ghostly spirit instead.\nWhile some cultures considered the knowledge of the dead to be unlimited, ancient Greeks and Romans believed that individual shades knew only certain things. The apparent value of their counsel may have been based on things they knew in life or knowledge they acquired after death. Ovid writes in his \"Metamorphoses\" of a marketplace in the underworld where the dead convene to exchange news and gossip.\nProhibited among Israelites.\nThere are also several references to necromancers \u2013 called \"bone-conjurers\" among Jews of the later Hellenistic period \u2013 in the Bible. The Book of Deuteronomy () explicitly warns the Israelites against engaging in the Canaanite practice of divination from the dead: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;9When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do according to the abominations of those nations. 10There shall not be found among you any one who maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or who useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, 11or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. 12For all who do these things are an abomination unto the LORD, and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee (KJV). Though Mosaic Law prescribed the death penalty to practitioners of necromancy (), this warning was not always heeded. One of the foremost examples is when King Saul had the Witch of Endor invoke the spirit of Samuel, a judge and prophet, from Sheol to divine the outcome of a coming battle (). However, the so-called witch was shocked at the presence of a familiar spirit in the image of Samuel for in I Sam 28:7 states \"Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor\" and in I Sam 28:12 says, \"when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out in a loud voice\", and the familiar spirit questioned his reawakening, asking as if he were Samuel the Prophet, \"Why hast thou disquieted me?\" Saul died the next day in combat, with Chronicles 10:13 implying this was due to the prohibition against necromancy.\nEarly and High Middle Age.\nMany medieval writers believed that actual resurrection required the assistance of God. They saw the practice of necromancy as conjuring demons who took the appearance of spirits. The practice became known explicitly as maleficium, and the Catholic Church condemned it. Though the practitioners of necromancy were linked by many common threads, there is no evidence that these necromancers ever organized as a group. One noted commonality among practitioners of necromancy was usually the utilization of certain toxic and hallucinogenic plants from the nightshade family such as black henbane, jimson weed, belladonna or mandrake, usually in magic salves or potions.\nMedieval necromancy is believed to be a synthesis of astral magic derived from Arabic influences and exorcism derived from Christian and Jewish teachings. Arabic influences are evident in rituals that involve moon phases, sun placement, day and time. Fumigation and the act of burying images are also found in both astral magic and necromancy. Christian and Jewish influences appear in the symbols and in the conjuration formulas used in summoning rituals.\nPractitioners were often members of the Christian clergy, though some nonclerical practitioners are recorded. In some instances, mere apprentices or those ordained to lower orders dabbled in the practice. They were connected by a belief in the manipulation of spiritual beings \u2013 especially demons \u2013 and magical practices. These practitioners were almost always literate and well educated. Most possessed basic knowledge of exorcism and had access to texts of astrology and of demonology. Clerical training was informal and university-based education rare. Most were trained under apprenticeships and were expected to have a basic knowledge of Latin, ritual and doctrine. This education was not always linked to spiritual guidance and seminaries were almost non-existent. This situation allowed some aspiring clerics to combine Christian rites with occult practices despite its condemnation in Christian doctrine.\nMedieval practitioners believed they could accomplish three things with necromancy: will manipulation, illusions, and knowledge:\nThe act of performing medieval necromancy usually involved magic circles, conjurations, and sacrifices such as those shown in the \"Munich Manual of Demonic Magic\":\nThe rare confessions of those accused of necromancy suggest that there was a range of spell casting and related magical experimentation. It is difficult to determine if these details were due to their practices, as opposed to the whims of their interrogators. John of Salisbury is one of the first examples related by Richard Kieckhefer, but as a Parisian ecclesiastical court record of 1323 shows, a \"group who were plotting to invoke the demon Berich from inside a circle made from strips of cat skin\" were obviously participating in what the Church would define as \"necromancy\".\nHerbert Stanley Redgrove claims necromancy as one of three chief branches of medieval ceremonial magic, alongside black magic and white magic. This does not correspond to contemporary classifications, which often conflate \"nigromancy\" (\"black-knowledge\") with \"necromancy\" (\"death-knowledge\").\nLate Middle Ages to Renaissance.\nIn the wake of inconsistencies of judgment, necromancers and other practitioners of the magic arts were able to utilize spells featuring holy names with impunity, as any biblical references in such rituals could be construed as prayers rather than spells. As a consequence, the necromancy that appears in the \"Munich Manual of Demonic Magic\" is an evolution of these theoretical understandings. It has been suggested that the authors of the \"Manual\" knowingly designed the book to be in discord with ecclesiastical law. The main recipe employed throughout the \"Manual\" used the same religious language and names of power alongside demonic names. An understanding of the names of God derived from apocryphal texts and the Hebrew Torah required that the author of such rites have at least a casual familiarity with these sources.\nWithin the tales related in occult manuals are found connections with stories from other cultures' literary traditions. For instance, the ceremony for conjuring a horse closely relates to the Arabic \"One Thousand and One Nights\" and French romances; Chaucer's \"The Squire's Tale\" also bears marked similarities. This becomes a parallel evolution of spells to foreign gods or demons that were once acceptable, and frames them into a new Christian context, albeit demonic and forbidden. As the material for these manuals was apparently derived from scholarly magical and religious texts from a variety of sources in many languages, the scholars who studied these texts likely manufactured their own aggregate sourcebook and manual with which to work spells or magic.\nIn the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, it is stated that \"Of all human opinions that is to be reputed the most foolish which deals with the belief in Necromancy, the sister of Alchemy, which gives birth to simple and natural things.\"\nModern era.\nIn the present day, necromancy is more generally used as a term to describe manipulation of death and the dead, or the pretense thereof, often facilitated through the use of ritual magic or some other kind of occult ceremony. Contemporary s\u00e9ances, channeling and Spiritualism verge on necromancy when supposedly invoked spirits are asked to reveal future events or secret information. Necromancy may also be presented as sciomancy, a branch of theurgic magic.\nAs to the practice of necromancy having endured in one form or another throughout the millennia, \"An Encyclop\u00e6dia of Occultism\" states: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The art is of almost universal usage. Considerable difference of opinion exists among modern adepts as to the exact methods to be properly pursued in the necromantic art, and it must be borne in mind that necromancy, which in the Middle Ages was called sorcery, shades into modern spiritualistic practice. There is no doubt, however, that necromancy is the touch-stone of occultism, for if, after careful preparation the adept can carry through to a successful issue, the raising of the soul from the other world, he has proved the value of his art.\nContemporary pop-culture.\nThe archvillain in J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings fantasy, Sauron, first reappears in the environs of Middle Earth as 'the Necromancer of Dol Guldur' in Tolkien's standalone prologue to the trilogy \"The Hobbit\". In fictional settings such as \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", or fantasy video games, necromancy is associated with the reanimation of corpses often meant to be used as weapons. This tradition appears to combine associations of conjuring the dead from European and Mediterranean traditions with elements involving Zombies that seem to derive from Caribbean folklore and practice.\nNecromancy is a form of magic in the Skulduggery Pleasant series, by Irish author Derek Landy. This form of magic is mostly concerned with the manipulation of shadow, darkness and life energy. In the series the most famous Necromancer is Lord Vile. The protagonist Valkyrie Cain deals with the allure of this form of magic and its consequences for much of her adult life.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are most often below the surface of the soil, but roots can also be aerial or aerating, that is, growing up above the ground or especially above water.\nFunction.\nRoots perform several essential and specialised roles that support plant growth, development and survival. Their primary functions are anchorage, uptake (absorption) of water and dissolved minerals, and conduction of these resources to the shoot. Beyond these, roots carry out a range of important secondary and adaptive functions \u2014 storage of reserves, synthesis of growth regulators, gas exchange in waterlogged environments, facilitation of symbiotic nutrient acquisition, and vegetative propagation.\nPrimary functions.\nAnchorage and mechanical support. Roots fix the plant in the substrate and resist mechanical forces (wind, waterflow); vigorous root systems are essential for crop stability and prevention of lodging.\nAbsorption of water and mineral nutrients. Root epidermal cells and root hairs take up soil water and dissolved ions; these are then conducted to the shoot via the xylem. Root architecture (depth, spread) determines access to water and nutrients in different soil horizons.\nSecondary and specialised functions.\nStorage of reserve food and water. Many roots (fleshy taproots, tuberous roots) accumulate carbohydrates and water that support perennial growth or regrowth after dormancy. Examples include sweet potato and carrot.\nConduction. Roots conduct absorbed water, minerals and some synthesised compounds to the shoot via vascular tissues (xylem and phloem connections).\nSynthesis of growth regulators. Roots synthesise and modulate plant hormones (e.g., cytokinins, some auxin metabolism), influencing shoot development and whole-plant physiology.\nAeration and gas exchange (in aquatic/waterlogged soils). Specialised structures (pneumatophores, aerial roots) permit gas exchange where soil oxygen is limited, enabling respiration in mangroves and other hydrophytes.\nSymbiotic interactions and enhanced nutrient uptake. Roots form mutualisms (e.g., mycorrhizae, nitrogen-fixing nodules) that greatly increase nutrient acquisition and stress tolerance. These associations remodel root architecture and function.\nMechanical adaptations and additional support. Adventitious and brace/prop roots (e.g., maize, some mangroves, banyan) provide extra support, anchorage and stability in particular environments.\nVegetative propagation. Adventitious rooting on stems, nodes or cuttings allows many species to reproduce asexually and to regenerate after damage; this is widely exploited in horticulture.\nNotes.\nMany functions overlap: a given root can simultaneously anchor, absorb, store reserves and engage in symbiosis. Root form and function are plastic and shaped by species genetics and environmental context (soil texture, water availability, aeration and mechanical stresses).\nTypes of roots (major rooting system).\nPlants produce a variety of root systems that differ in origin, structure and function (anchorage, absorption, storage, aeration and vegetative propagation). The two classical, broad categories are taproot and fibrous systems, but several specialised root types \u2014 notably adventitious, aerial, prop/stilt, climbing/adhesive, buttress, tuberous (storage) and floating roots \u2014 are biologically and ecologically important.\nTaproot system.\nA taproot system is dominated by a single, vertically growing primary root (the radicle) from which lateral roots arise. Taproots often function in deep anchorage and in storage of carbohydrates and water (common in many dicotyledons and some biennials/perennials). Examples include carrot (Daucus carota), dandelion (Taraxacum) and many true dicots.\nFibrous root system.\nA fibrous root system consists of numerous, similarly sized roots that form a dense network near the soil surface. In many species this network is composed largely of adventitious roots that arise from the stem base rather than the primary radicle. Fibrous systems are effective at soil binding, rapid uptake of surface nutrients and erosion control. Typical examples are grasses (Poaceae), wheat and rice.\nAdventitious roots.\nAdventitious roots arise from non-root organs (stems, nodes, leaves or callus tissue) and play multiple roles: replacing or supplementing the primary root, providing mechanical support, enabling vegetative propagation, and forming specialized root types (aerial roots, prop roots, pneumatophores). They are especially important in monocots and many cultivated plants, and are a common response to wounding, flooding or other stressors.\nExamples and notes: in many monocots the functional root system is adventitious (forming a fibrous habit); maize (Zea mays) produces nodal brace/prop roots that stabilise the stem; banyan (Ficus spp.) develops aerial adventitious roots that may become supportive trunks; many cuttings root adventitiously during vegetative propagation.\nAnatomy.\nRoot morphology is divided into four zones: the root cap, the apical meristem, the elongation zone, and the hair. The root cap of new roots helps the root penetrate the soil. These root caps are sloughed off as the root goes deeper creating a slimy surface that provides lubrication. The apical meristem behind the root cap produces new root cells that elongate. Then, root hairs form that absorb water and mineral nutrients from the soil. The first root in seed producing plants is the radicle, which expands from the plant embryo after seed germination.\nWhen dissected, the arrangement of the cells in a root is root hair, epidermis, epiblem, cortex, endodermis, pericycle and, lastly, the vascular tissue in the centre of a root to transport the water absorbed by the root to other places of the plant.\nPerhaps the most striking characteristic of roots that distinguishes them from other plant organs such as stem-branches and leaves is that roots have an \"endogenous\" origin, \"i.e.\", they originate and develop from an inner layer of the mother axis, such as pericycle. In contrast, stem-branches and leaves are \"exogenous\", \"i.e.\", they start to develop from the cortex, an outer layer.\nIn response to the concentration of nutrients, roots also synthesize cytokinin, which acts as a signal as to how fast the shoots can grow. Roots often function in storage of food and nutrients. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with certain fungi to form mycorrhizae, and a large range of other organisms including bacteria also closely associate with roots.\nRoot system architecture (RSA).\nDefinition.\nIn its simplest form, the term root system architecture (RSA) refers to the spatial configuration of a plant's root system. This system can be extremely complex and is dependent upon multiple factors such as the species of the plant itself, the composition of the soil and the availability of nutrients. Root architecture plays the important role of providing a secure supply of nutrients and water as well as anchorage and support.\nThe configuration of root systems serves to structurally support the plant and compete with other plants for uptake of nutrients within the soil. Roots grow in response to specific ecological conditions, which, if changed, can impede a plant's growth. For example, a root system that has developed in dry soil may not be as efficient in flooded soil, yet plants are able to adapt to other changes in the environment, such as seasonal changes.\nTerms and components.\nThe main terms used to classify the architecture of a root system are:\nAll components of the root architecture are regulated through a complex interaction between genetic responses and responses due to environmental stimuli. These developmental stimuli are categorized as intrinsic, the genetic and nutritional influences, or extrinsic, the environmental influences, and are interpreted by signal transduction pathways.\nExtrinsic factors affecting root architecture include gravity, light exposure, water and oxygen, as well as the availability or lack of nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, aluminium and sodium chloride. The main hormones (intrinsic stimuli) and respective pathways responsible for root architecture development include:\nGrowth.\nEarly root growth is one of the functions of the apical meristem located near the tip of the root. The meristem cells more or less continuously divide, producing more meristem, root cap cells (these are sacrificed to protect the meristem), and undifferentiated root cells. The latter become the primary tissues of the root, first undergoing elongation, a process that pushes the root tip forward in the growing medium. Gradually these cells differentiate and mature into specialized cells of the root tissues.\nGrowth from apical meristems is known as primary growth, which encompasses all elongation.\nSecondary growth encompasses all growth in diameter, a major component of woody plant tissues and many nonwoody plants. For example, storage roots of sweet potato have secondary growth but are not woody. Secondary growth occurs at the lateral meristems, namely the vascular cambium and cork cambium. The former forms secondary xylem and secondary phloem, while the latter forms the periderm.\nIn plants with secondary growth, the vascular cambium, originating between the xylem and the phloem, forms a cylinder of tissue along the stem and root. The vascular cambium forms new cells on both the inside and outside of the cambium cylinder, with those on the inside forming secondary xylem cells, and those on the outside forming secondary phloem cells. As secondary xylem accumulates, the \"girth\" (lateral dimensions) of the stem and root increases. As a result, tissues beyond the secondary phloem including the epidermis and cortex, in many cases tend to be pushed outward and are eventually \"sloughed off\" (shed).\nAt this point, the cork cambium begins to form the periderm, consisting of protective cork cells. The walls of cork cells contains suberin thickenings, which is an extra cellular complex biopolymer. The suberin thickenings functions by providing a physical barrier, protection against pathogens and by preventing water loss from the surrounding tissues. In addition, it also aids the process of wound healing in plants. It is also postulated that suberin could be a component of the apoplastic barrier (present at the outer cell layers of roots) which prevents toxic compounds from entering the root and reduces radial oxygen loss (ROL) from the aerenchyma during waterlogging. In roots, the cork cambium originates in the pericycle, a component of the vascular cylinder.\nThe vascular cambium produces new layers of secondary xylem annually. The xylem vessels are dead at maturity (in some) but are responsible for most water transport through the vascular tissue in stems and roots.\nTree roots usually grow to three times the diameter of the branch spread, only half of which lie underneath the trunk and canopy. The roots from one side of a tree usually supply nutrients to the foliage on the same side. Some families however, such as Sapindaceae (the maple family), show no correlation between root location and where the root supplies nutrients on the plant.\nRegulation.\nThere is a correlation of roots using the process of plant perception to sense their physical environment to grow, including the sensing of light, and physical barriers. Plants also sense gravity and respond through auxin pathways, resulting in gravitropism. Over time, roots can crack foundations, snap water lines, and lift sidewalks. Research has shown that roots have ability to recognize 'self' and 'non-self' roots in same soil environment.\nThe correct environment of air, mineral nutrients and water directs plant roots to grow in any direction to meet the plant's needs. Roots will shy or shrink away from dry or other poor soil conditions.\nGravitropism directs roots to grow downward at germination, the growth mechanism of plants that also causes the shoot to grow upward.\nDifferent types of roots such as primary, seminal, lateral and crown are maintained at different gravitropic setpoint angles i.e. the direction in which they grow. Recent research show that root angle in cereal crops such as barley and wheat is regulated by a novel gene called Enhanced Gravitropism 1 (EGT1).\nResearch indicates that plant roots growing in search of productive nutrition can sense and avoid soil compaction through diffusion of the gas ethylene.\nShade avoidance response.\nIn order to avoid shade, plants utilize a shade avoidance response. When a plant is under dense vegetation, the presence of other vegetation nearby will cause the plant to avoid lateral growth and experience an increase in upward shoot, as well as downward root growth. In order to escape shade, plants adjust their root architecture, most notably by decreasing the length and amount of lateral roots emerging from the primary root. Experimentation of mutant variants of \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" found that plants sense the Red to Far Red light ratio that enters the plant through photoreceptors known as phytochromes. Nearby plant leaves will absorb red light and reflect far-red light, which will cause the ratio red to far red light to lower. The phytochrome PhyA that senses this Red to Far Red light ratio is localized in both the root system as well as the shoot system of plants, but through knockout mutant experimentation, it was found that root localized PhyA does not sense the light ratio, whether directly or axially, that leads to changes in the lateral root architecture. Research instead found that shoot localized PhyA is the phytochrome responsible for causing these architectural changes of the lateral root. Research has also found that phytochrome completes these architectural changes through the manipulation of auxin distribution in the root of the plant. When a low enough Red to Far Red ratio is sensed by PhyA, the phyA in the shoot will be mostly in its active form. In this form, PhyA stabilize the transcription factor HY5 causing it to no longer be degraded as it is when phyA is in its inactive form. This stabilized transcription factor is then able to be transported to the roots of the plant through the phloem, where it proceeds to induce its own transcription as a way to amplify its signal. In the roots of the plant HY5 functions to inhibit an auxin response factor known as ARF19, a response factor responsible for the translation of PIN3 and LAX3, two well known auxin transporting proteins. Thus, through manipulation of ARF19, the level and activity of auxin transporters PIN3 and LAX3 is inhibited. Once inhibited, auxin levels will be low in areas where lateral root emergence normally occurs, resulting in a failure for the plant to have the emergence of the lateral root primordium through the root pericycle. With this complex manipulation of Auxin transport in the roots, lateral root emergence will be inhibited in the roots and the root will instead elongate downwards, promoting vertical plant growth in an attempt to avoid shade.\nResearch of Arabidopsis has led to the discovery of how this auxin mediated root response works. In an attempt to discover the role that phytochrome plays in lateral root development, Salisbury et al. (2007) worked with \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" grown on agar plates. Salisbury et al. used wild type plants along with varying protein knockout and gene knockout Arabidopsis mutants to observe the results these mutations had on the root architecture, protein presence, and gene expression. To do this, Salisbury et al. used GFP fluorescence along with other forms of both macro and microscopic imagery to observe any changes various mutations caused. From these research, Salisbury et al. were able to theorize that shoot located phytochromes alter auxin levels in roots, controlling lateral root development and overall root architecture. In the experiments of van Gelderen et al. (2018), they wanted to see if and how it is that the shoot of \"A.\u00a0thaliana\" alters and affects root development and root architecture. To do this, they took \"Arabidopsis\" plants, grew them in agar gel, and exposed the roots and shoots to separate sources of light. From here, they altered the different wavelengths of light the shoot and root of the plants were receiving and recorded the lateral root density, amount of lateral roots, and the general architecture of the lateral roots. To identify the function of specific photoreceptors, proteins, genes, and hormones, they utilized various \"Arabidopsis\" knockout mutants and observed the resulting changes in lateral roots architecture. Through their observations and various experiments, van Gelderen et al. were able to develop a mechanism for how root detection of Red to Far-red light ratios alter lateral root development.\nTypes.\nA true root system consists of a primary root and secondary roots (or lateral roots).\nSpecialized.\nThe roots, or parts of roots, of many plant species have become specialized to serve adaptive purposes besides the two primary functions, described in the introduction.\nDepths.\nThe distribution of vascular plant roots within soil depends on plant form, the spatial and temporal availability of water and nutrients, and the physical properties of the soil. The deepest roots are generally found in deserts and temperate coniferous forests; the shallowest in tundra, boreal forest and temperate grasslands. The deepest observed living root, at least below the ground surface, was observed during the excavation of an open-pit mine in Arizona, US. Some roots can grow as deep as the tree is high. The majority of roots on most plants are however found relatively close to the surface where nutrient availability and aeration are more favourable for growth. Rooting depth may be physically restricted by rock or compacted soil close below the surface, or by anaerobic soil conditions.\nEvolutionary history.\nThe fossil record of roots\u2014or rather, infilled voids where roots rotted after death\u2014spans back to the late Silurian, about 430\u00a0million years ago. Their identification is difficult, because casts and molds of roots are so similar in appearance to animal burrows. They can be discriminated using a range of features. The evolutionary development of roots likely happened from the modification of shallow rhizomes (modified horizontal stems) which anchored primitive vascular plants combined with the development of filamentous outgrowths (called rhizoids) which anchored the plants and conducted water to the plant from the soil.\nEnvironmental interactions.\nLight has been shown to have some impact on roots, but it's not been studied as much as the effect of light on other plant systems. Early research in the 1930s found that light decreased the effectiveness of Indole-3-acetic acid on adventitious root initiation. Studies of the pea in the 1950s shows that lateral root formation was inhibited by light, and in the early 1960s researchers found that light could induce positive gravitropic responses in some situations. The effects of light on root elongation has been studied for monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants, with the majority of studies finding that light inhibited root elongation, whether pulsed or continuous. Studies of \"Arabidopsis\" in the 1990s showed negative phototropism and inhibition of the elongation of root hairs in light sensed by phyB.\nCertain plants, namely Fabaceae, form root nodules in order to associate and form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria called rhizobia. Owing to the high energy required to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, the bacteria take carbon compounds from the plant to fuel the process. In return, the plant takes nitrogen compounds produced from ammonia by the bacteria.\nSoil temperature is a factor that effects root initiation and length. Root length is usually impacted more dramatically by temperature than overall mass, where cooler temperatures tend to cause more lateral growth because downward extension is limited by cooler temperatures at subsoil levels. Needs vary by plant species, but in temperate regions cool temperatures may limit root systems. Cool temperature species like oats, rapeseed, rye, wheat fare better in lower temperatures than summer annuals like maize and cotton. Researchers have found that plants like cotton develop wider and shorter taproots in cooler temperatures. The first root originating from the seed usually has a wider diameter than root branches, so smaller root diameters are expected if temperatures increase root initiation. Root diameter also decreases when the root elongates.\nPlant interactions.\nPlants can interact with one another in their environment through their root systems. Studies have demonstrated that plant-plant interaction occurs among root systems via the soil as a medium. Researchers have tested whether plants growing in ambient conditions would change their behavior if a nearby plant was exposed to drought conditions.\nSince nearby plants showed no changes in stomatal aperture researchers believe the drought signal spread through the roots and soil, not through the air as a volatile chemical signal.\nSoil interactions.\nSoil microbiota can suppress both disease and beneficial root symbionts (mycorrhizal fungi are easier to establish in sterile soil). Inoculation with soil bacteria can increase internode extension, yield and quicken flowering. The migration of bacteria along the root varies with natural soil conditions. For example, research has found that the root systems of wheat seeds inoculated with \"Azotobacter\" showed higher populations in soils favorable to \"Azotobacter\" growth. Some studies have been unsuccessful in increasing the levels of certain microbes (such as \"P.\u00a0fluorescens\") in natural soil without prior sterilization.\nGrass root systems are beneficial at reducing soil erosion by holding the soil together. Perennial grasses that grow wild in rangelands contribute organic matter to the soil when their old roots decay after attacks by beneficial fungi, protozoa, bacteria, insects and worms release nutrients.\nScientists have observed significant diversity of the microbial cover of roots at around 10 percent of three week old root segments covered. On younger roots there was even low coverage, but even on 3-month-old roots the coverage was only around 37%. Before the 1970s, scientists believed that the majority of the root surface was covered by microorganisms.\nNutrient absorption.\nResearchers studying maize seedlings found that calcium absorption was greatest in the apical root segment, and potassium at the base of the root. Along other root segments absorption was similar. Absorbed potassium is transported to the root tip, and to a lesser extent other parts of the root, then also to the shoot and grain. Calcium transport from the apical segment is slower, mostly transported upward and accumulated in stem and shoot.\nResearchers found that partial deficiencies of K or P did not change the fatty acid composition of phosphatidyl choline in \"Brassica napus L.\" plants. Calcium deficiency did, on the other hand, lead to a marked decline of polyunsaturated compounds that would be expected to have negative impacts for integrity of the plant membrane, that could effect some properties like its permeability, and is needed for the ion uptake activity of the root membranes.\nEconomic importance.\nThe term root crops refers to any edible underground plant structure, but many root crops are actually stems, such as potato tubers. Edible roots include cassava, sweet potato, beet, carrot, rutabaga, turnip, parsnip, radish, yam and horseradish. Spices obtained from roots include sassafras, angelica, sarsaparilla and licorice.\nSugar beet is an important source of sugar. Yam roots are a source of estrogen compounds used in birth control pills. The fish poison and insecticide rotenone is obtained from roots of \"Lonchocarpus\" spp. Important medicines from roots are ginseng, aconite, ipecac, gentian and reserpine. Several legumes that have nitrogen-fixing root nodules are used as green manure crops, which provide nitrogen fertilizer for other crops when plowed under. Specialized bald cypress roots, termed knees, are sold as souvenirs, lamp bases and carved into folk art. Native Americans used the flexible roots of white spruce for basketry.\nTree roots can heave and destroy concrete sidewalks and crush or clog buried pipes. The aerial roots of strangler fig have damaged ancient Mayan temples in Central America and the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.\nTrees stabilize soil on a slope prone to landslides. The root hairs work as an anchor on the soil.\nVegetative propagation of plants via cuttings depends on adventitious root formation. Hundreds of millions of plants are propagated via cuttings annually including chrysanthemum, poinsettia, carnation, ornamental shrubs and many houseplants.\nRoots can also protect the environment by holding the soil to reduce soil erosion. This is especially important in areas such as sand dunes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Aldose reductase activity increases as the glucose concentration rises in diabetes in those tissues that are not insulin sensitive, which include the lenses, peripheral nerves, and glomerulus. Sorbitol does not diffuse through cell membranes easily and therefore accumulates, causing osmotic damage which leads to retinopathy and neuropathy.\nExamples.\nNatural sources reported to inhibit aldose reductase include indian gooseberry, spinach, cumin seeds, fennel seeds, basil leaves, lemon, black pepper, orange, curry leaves, cannabis, cinnamon and lichen. Luteolin, a type of flavonoid found mostly in leaves, and their synthetic derivatives are potential inhibitors of aldose reductase. \nOther ARIs: \nDiabetic cataract.\nDiabetic cataract formation follows an increase in sugars in the lens. The excess sugar within the lens is reduced by aldose reductase to its alcohol, but the lens capsule is relatively impermeable to sugar alcohols. Because of the excess sugar alcohol (polyol), the lens imbibes water, causing osmotic imbalance. Eventually, increased sodium and decreased potassium levels and decreased glutathione levels lead to cataract formation. Topical administration of aldose reductase inhibitors have been shown to prevent the cataract in rats.\nAsthma and COPD.\nThis class of drugs is also under investigation as a possible root pathology modulating treatment for asthma and COPD since it has been shown that they inhibit goblet cell metaplasia in the respiratory epithelium, thereby reducing the copious mucous secretion associated with these.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is thus the smallest (for set inclusion) subspace containing S. It is referred to as the subspace \"spanned by\" S, or by the vectors in S. Conversely, S is called a \"spanning set\" of W, and we say that S \"spans\" W.\nIt follows from this definition that the span of S is the set of all finite linear combinations of elements (vectors) of S, and can be defined as such. That is, formula_9 \nWhen S is empty, the only possibility is \"n\" = 0, and the previous expression for formula_10 reduces to the empty sum. The standard convention for the empty sum implies thus formula_11 a property that is immediate with the other definitions. However, many introductory textbooks simply include this fact as part of the definition.\nWhen formula_12 is finite, one has\nformula_13\nExamples.\nThe real vector space formula_14 has {(\u22121, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)} as a spanning set. This particular spanning set is also a basis. If (\u22121, 0, 0) were replaced by (1, 0, 0), it would also form the canonical basis of formula_14.\nAnother spanning set for the same space is given by {(1, 2, 3), (0, 1, 2), (\u22121, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442, 3), (1, 1, 1)}, but this set is not a basis, because it is linearly dependent.\nThe set {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0)} is not a spanning set of formula_14, since its span is the space of all vectors in formula_14 whose last component is zero. That space is also spanned by the set {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0)}, as (1, 1, 0) is a linear combination of (1, 0, 0) and (0, 1, 0). Thus, the spanned space is not formula_18 It can be identified with formula_19 by removing the third components equal to zero.\nThe empty set is a spanning set of {(0, 0, 0)}, since the empty set is a subset of all possible vector spaces in formula_14, and {(0, 0, 0)} is the intersection of all of these vector spaces.\nThe set of monomials xn, where n is a non-negative integer, spans the space of polynomials.\nTheorems.\nEquivalence of definitions.\nThe set of all linear combinations of a subset S of V, a vector space over K, is the smallest linear subspace of V containing S.\n\"Proof.\" We first prove that span \"S\" is a subspace of V. Since S is a subset of V, we only need to prove the existence of a zero vector 0 in span \"S\", that span \"S\" is closed under addition, and that span \"S\" is closed under scalar multiplication. Letting formula_21, it is trivial that the zero vector of V exists in span \"S\", since formula_22. Adding together two linear combinations of S also produces a linear combination of S: formula_23, where all formula_24, and multiplying a linear combination of S by a scalar formula_25 will produce another linear combination of S: formula_26. Thus span \"S\" is a subspace of V.\nIt follows that formula_27, since every v\"i\" is a linear combination of S (trivially). Suppose that W is a linear subspace of V containing S. Since W is closed under addition and scalar multiplication, then every linear combination formula_28 must be contained in W. Thus, span \"S\" is contained in every subspace of V containing S, and the intersection of all such subspaces, or the smallest such subspace, is equal to the set of all linear combinations of S.\nSize of spanning set is at least size of linearly independent set.\nEvery spanning set S of a vector space V must contain at least as many elements as any linearly independent set of vectors from V.\n\"Proof.\" Let formula_29 be a spanning set and formula_30 be a linearly independent set of vectors from V. We want to show that formula_31.\nSince S spans V, then formula_32 must also span V, and formula_33 must be a linear combination of S. Thus formula_32 is linearly dependent, and we can remove one vector from S that is a linear combination of the other elements. This vector cannot be any of the w\"i\", since W is linearly independent. The resulting set is formula_35, which is a spanning set of V. We repeat this step n times, where the resulting set after the pth step is the union of formula_36 and m - p vectors of S.\nIt is ensured until the nth step that there will always be some v\"i\" to remove out of S for every adjoint of v, and thus there are at least as many v\"i\"'s as there are w\"i\"'s\u2014i.e. formula_31. To verify this, we assume by way of contradiction that formula_38. Then, at the mth step, we have the set formula_39 and we can adjoin another vector formula_40. But, since formula_39 is a spanning set of V, formula_40 is a linear combination of formula_39. This is a contradiction, since W is linearly independent.\nSpanning set can be reduced to a basis.\nLet V be a finite-dimensional vector space. Any set of vectors that spans V can be reduced to a basis for V, by discarding vectors if necessary (i.e. if there are linearly dependent vectors in the set). If the axiom of choice holds, this is true without the assumption that V has finite dimension. This also indicates that a basis is a minimal spanning set when V is finite-dimensional.\nGeneralizations.\nGeneralizing the definition of the span of points in space, a subset X of the ground set of a matroid is called a spanning set if the rank of X equals the rank of the entire ground set\nThe vector space definition can also be generalized to modules. Given an R-module A and a collection of elements \"a\"1, ..., \"an\" of A, the submodule of A spanned by \"a\"1, ..., \"an\" is the sum of cyclic modules\nformula_44\nconsisting of all \"R\"-linear combinations of the elements \"ai\". As with the case of vector spaces, the submodule of \"A\" spanned by any subset of \"A\" is the intersection of all submodules containing that subset.\nClosed linear span (functional analysis).\nIn functional analysis, a closed linear span of a set of vectors is the minimal closed set which contains the linear span of that set.\nSuppose that X is a normed vector space and let E be any non-empty subset of X. The closed linear span of E, denoted by formula_45 or formula_46, is the intersection of all the closed linear subspaces of X which contain E.\nOne mathematical formulation of this is\nformula_47\nThe closed linear span of the set of functions \"xn\" on the interval [0, 1], where \"n\" is a non-negative integer, depends on the norm used. If the \"L\"2 norm is used, then the closed linear span is the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on the interval. But if the maximum norm is used, the closed linear span will be the space of continuous functions on the interval. In either case, the closed linear span contains functions that are not polynomials, and so are not in the linear span itself. However, the cardinality of the set of functions in the closed linear span is the cardinality of the continuum, which is the same cardinality as for the set of polynomials.\nNotes.\nThe linear span of a set is dense in the closed linear span. Moreover, as stated in the lemma below, the closed linear span is indeed the closure of the linear span.\nClosed linear spans are important when dealing with closed linear subspaces (which are themselves highly important, see Riesz's lemma).\nA useful lemma.\nLet X be a normed space and let E be any non-empty subset of X. Then\n(E)&lt;/math&gt; is a closed linear subspace of \"X\" which contains \"E\",\n | formula_48, viz. formula_45 is the closure of formula_50,\n | formula_51\n | formula_52\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As a royal clerk to the king and two archbishops, he travelled widely and wrote extensively. He studied and taught in France and visited Rome several times, meeting the Pope. He was nominated for several bishoprics but turned them down in the hope of becoming Bishop of St Davids, but was unsuccessful despite considerable support. His final post was as Archdeacon of Brecon, from which he retired to academic study for the remainder of his life. \nGerald wrote on a variety of topics; his works on Ireland and Wales, which contain details on the culture, contemporary life, and history of those countries, are generally considered the most distinguished. Much of his writing survives.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nBorn c.\u20091146 at Manorbier Castle in Pembrokeshire, Wales, Gerald was of mixed Norman and Welsh descent. Gerald was the youngest son of William Fitz Odo de Barry (or Barri), the common ancestor of the De Barry family of Barry, Glamorganshire, who subsequently invaded Ireland, a retainer of Arnulf de Montgomery and Gerald de Windsor, and one of the most powerful Anglo-Norman barons in Wales. His mother was Angharad FitzGerald, a daughter of Gerald FitzWalter of Windsor, Constable of Pembroke Castle, and his wife Nest ferch Rhys, daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr, the last King of South Wales. Through his mother Angharad, Gerald was a nephew of David FitzGerald, Bishop of St Davids, as well as a great-nephew of Gruffydd ap Rhys, the son and heir of Rhys ap Tewdwr, and a cousin of Rhys ap Gruffydd, the famous Arglwydd (Lord) Rhys and his family.\nGerald received his initial education at the Benedictine house of Gloucester, followed by a period of study in Paris from c.\u20091165\u201374, where he studied the trivium. He was employed by Richard of Dover, the Archbishop of Canterbury, on various ecclesiastical missions in Wales, and distinguished himself by his efforts to remove supposed abuses of consanguinity and tax laws flourishing in the Welsh church at the time. He was appointed in 1174 as Archdeacon of Brecon, to which was attached a residence at Llanddew. He obtained this position by reporting the existence of the previous archdeacon's mistress; the man was promptly dismissed. While administering this post, Gerald collected tithes of wool and cheese from the populace; the income from the archdeaconry supported him for many years.\nUpon the death of his uncle, the Bishop of St Davids, in 1176, the chapter nominated Gerald as his successor. St Davids had the long-term aim of becoming independent of Canterbury, and the chapter may have thought that Gerald was the man to take up its cause. King Henry II of England, fresh from his struggle with Archbishop Thomas Becket, promptly rejected Gerald in favour of Peter de Leia, one of his Norman retainers, possibly because Gerald's Welsh blood and ties to the ruling family of Deheubarth made him seem like a troublesome prospect. According to Gerald, the king said at the time: \"It is neither necessary nor expedient for king or archbishop that a man of great honesty or vigour should become Bishop of St Davids, for fear that the Crown and Canterbury should suffer thereby. Such an appointment would only give strength to the Welsh and increase their pride.\" The chapter acquiesced in the decision, and Gerald, disappointed with the result, withdrew to the University of Paris. From c.\u20091179-8, he studied and taught canon law and theology. He returned to England and spent an additional five years studying theology. In 1180, he received a minor appointment from the Bishop of St Davids, which he soon resigned.\nTravels.\nGerald became a royal clerk and chaplain to King Henry II of England in 1184, first acting as a mediator between the crown and Prince Rhys ap Gruffydd. He was chosen to accompany one of the king's sons, John, in 1185 on John's first expedition to Ireland. This was the catalyst for his literary career; his work \"Topographia Hibernica\" (first circulated in manuscript in 1188, and revised at least four times) is an account of his journey to Ireland; Gerald always referred to it as his \"Topography\", though \"history\" is the more accurate term.\nHe followed it up, shortly afterwards, with an account of Henry's conquest of Ireland, the \"Expugnatio Hibernica\". Both works were revised and added to several times before his death, and display a notable degree of Latin learning, as well as a great deal of prejudice against foreign people. Gerald was proud to be related to some of the Norman invaders of Ireland, such as his maternal uncle Robert FitzStephen and Raymond FitzGerald, and his influential account, which portrays the Irish as barbaric savages, gives important insight into Cambro-Norman views of Ireland and the history of the invasion.\nHaving thus demonstrated his usefulness, Gerald was selected to accompany the Archbishop of Canterbury, Baldwin of Forde, on a tour of Wales in 1188, the object being a recruitment campaign for the Third Crusade. His account of that journey, the \"Itinerarium Cambriae\" (1191) was followed by the \"Descriptio Cambriae\" in 1194.\nHis two works on Wales remain very valuable historical documents, useful for their descriptions (however untrustworthy and inflected by ideology, whimsy, and his unique style) of Welsh and Norman culture. It is uncertain whether Gerald was a Welsh speaker; although he quotes Welsh proverbs and appears familiar with the language, he seems not to have been employed as an interpreter for the expedition.\nAs a royal clerk, Gerald observed significant political events first-hand and was offered appointments to the bishoprics of Wexford and Leighlin, and apparently, slightly later, the bishopric of Ossory and the archbishopric of Cashel, and later the bishopric of Bangor in Wales; and, in 1191, that of Llandaff. He turned them all down, possibly in the hope of landing a more prominent bishopric in the future. He was acquainted with Walter Map, whose career shares some similarities with Gerald's. Retiring from royal service, he lived in Lincoln from c.\u20091196 to 1198, when his friend, William de Montibus, was chancellor of the cathedral. In this period, \"De principis instructione\" was probably the first written, a useful historical source of contemporary events. It was an influential work at the time, spreading, for example, the legend of MacAlpin's treason. Here, Gerald is frequently critical of the rule of the Angevin kings, a shift from his earlier praise of Henry II in the \"Topographia\". He also wrote a life of St Hugh of Lincoln.\nAttempts to become bishop of St Davids.\nOn the death of Peter de Leia in 1198, the chapter of St Davids again nominated Gerald for the bishopric, but Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, refused confirmation. Representatives of the canons followed Richard I to France, but before they could interview him, he died; his successor, King John, received them kindly and granted them permission to hold an election. They were unanimous in their selection of Gerald, and Gerald acted as bishop-elect for much of the next four years; and, as Hubert still refused to confirm the election, Gerald started for Rome to have his election confirmed. There he had an interview with Pope Innocent III. He visited Rome on three occasions (1199\u20131200; 1201; 1202\u20133) in support of his claims. But in 1198, the archbishop had forestalled him, and his agents in Rome undermined Gerald's case; and as the pope was not convinced that St David's was independent of Canterbury, Gerald's mission failed. Gerald had pleaded not only his own cause, but that of St Davids as a Metropolitan archbishopric (and thus of the same status as Canterbury) reviving the earlier claims of Rhygyfarch and Bishop Bernard of St Davids. It was in connexion with this cause that he wrote his books \"De jure Menevensis Ecclesi\u00e2\" and \"De Rebus a Se Gestis\". Gerald returned, and his cause was now supported by the Princes of Wales, most notably Llywelyn the Great, and Gruffydd ap Rhys II, while King John, frequently in conflict with the Welsh, warmly espoused the cause of the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1202, Gerald was accused of stirring up the Welsh to rebellion and was put on trial, but the trial came to nothing as the principal judges were absent. After this long struggle, the chapter of St David's deserted Gerald, and having been obliged to leave Wales, he fled to Rome. The ports had been closed against him, so he travelled in secret. In April 1203 Pope Innocent III annulled both elections, and Geoffrey of Henlaw was appointed to the See of St Davids, despite the strenuous exertions of Gerald. Travelling back to France, he was briefly imprisoned there for these actions. He was afterwards reconciled with the king and was forced to vow never again to support the primacy of St Davids over Canterbury. The expenses of his unsuccessful election were paid by the crown. Gerald maintained his appointment had been prevented by fear of its possible effect on national politics in Wales. He famously complained in a letter to Innocent III, \"Because I am a Welshman am I to be debarred from all preferments in Wales? On the same reasoning so would an Englishman in England, a Frenchman in France, and Italian in Italy. But I am sprung from the Princes of Wales and the Barons of the Marches, and when I see injustice in either race I hate it.\" At this point he resigned his position as archdeacon of Brecon.\nLater life.\nGerald spent the remainder of his life in academic study, most probably in Lincoln, producing works of devotional instruction and politics, and revising the works on Ireland and Wales he had written earlier in his life. He spent two years (1204\u20136) in Ireland with his relatives and made a fourth visit to Rome, purely as a pilgrimage, in 1206. The controversy over St Davids soured his relationship with the crown. In 1216, a baronial plan to put Louis VIII of France on the throne of England in the First Barons' War was warmly welcomed by him. He died in about 1223 in his 77th year, probably in Hereford, and he is, according to some accounts, buried at St Davids Cathedral.\nThere is a statue, by Henry Poole of Gerald in City Hall, Cardiff, and he was included in the vote on 100 Welsh Heroes for his \"Descriptio Cambriae\" and \"Itinerarium Cambriae\". His reputation in Ireland, due to his negative portrayal of the Irish, is much less friendly.\nWorks.\nGerald's writings in good-quality Latin, based on a thorough knowledge of Classical authors, reflect experiences gained on his travels as well as his great knowledge of the standard authorities. He was respected as a scholar in his time and afterwards. The noted scholar Edward Augustus Freeman, in his \"Norman Conquest\", said he was \"the father of comparative philology,\" and in the preface to the last volume of Gerald's works in the Rolls Series, he calls him \"one of the most learned men of a learned age,\" \"the universal scholar.\" His writings were prolific, running to about ten volumes in modern printed editions. Gerald was a man of strong opinions whose works are frequently polemical, including bitter attacks on his enemies, but he also had an intense curiosity, recording much valuable detail of everyday life in his ethnographic works.\nIt is generally agreed today that his most distinguished works are those dealing with Wales and Ireland, with his two books on his beloved Wales the most important: \"Itinerarium Cambriae\" and \"Descriptio Cambriae\" which tell us much about Welsh history and geography and reflect on the cultural relationship between the Welsh and the English. Gerald, despite his desire for an independent Welsh Church and admiration for parts of Welsh life, was very loyal to Norman Marcher rule, regarding the Normans as more civilised than the Welsh, a feeling reflected in his writings. Professor Davies tells us that Gerald, whom he calls \"an admirable story-teller\", is the only source for some of the most famous of the Welsh folk tales including the declaration of the old man of Pencader to Henry II which concludes \"Descriptio Cambriae\": &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This nation, O King, may now, as in former times, be harassed, and in a great measure weakened and destroyed by your and other powers, and it will also prevail by its laudable exertions, but it can never be totally subdued through the wrath of man, unless the wrath of God shall concur. Nor do I think that any other nation than this of Wales, nor any other language, whatever may hereafter come to pass, shall on the day of severe examination before the Supreme Judge, answer for this corner of the earth.\nIt was Gerald who also wrote (of the Welsh) that \"If they would be inseparable, they would be insuperable\", and that, unlike the English hirelings, who fight for power or to procure gain or wealth, the Welsh patriots fight for their country. He had pleasant things to say about the poetic talents of his people, too:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In their rhymed songs and set speeches they are so subtle and ingenious that they produce, in their native tongue, ornaments of wonderful and exquisite invention both in the words and the sentences... They make use of alliteration in preference to all other ornaments of rhetoric, and that particular kind which joins by consonancy the first letters or syllables of words.\nGerald could not have predicted the later perfection of \"cynghanedd\", the complex system of sound correspondence that has characterised the strict-metre poetry of the Welsh for so many centuries and that is still practised today, especially in competitions for the \"eisteddfod\" chair. \"Cynghanedd\" did not become a formal system with strict rules until the fourteenth century, but its uniquely Welsh forms had been honed for centuries before that.\nFinally, in \"Descriptio Cambriae\", Gerald penned the following words that give so much pride to Welsh singers of today, especially those who participate in the immensely popular \"cymanfaoedd canu\" (hymn-singing festivals) held throughout Wales and North America:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In their musical concerts they do not sing in unison like the inhabitants of other countries, but in many different parts... You will hear as many different parts and voices as there are performers, who all at length unite with organic melody.\nAnother part of the above work, however, is less positive. As Gerald puts it, \"an attention to order now requires that, in this second part, we should employ our pen in pointing out those particulars in which it seems to transgress the line of virtue and commendation\". David Powel published an abridged version of \"Itinerarium Cambriae\" and \"Descriptio Cambriae\" in 1585, omitting Gerald's negative comments about the Welsh. Due to translations into English, the first being done by Sir Richard Colt Hoare, Bart., and other translations such as in Everyman's Library and Penguin Classics, Gerald's works on Wales are well known today.\nIn Gerald's writing on Ireland, his love of music is very evident, too.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Chapter XI of Distinction III (\"Topographia Hibernica\", Of the incomparable skill of the Irish in playing upon musical instruments): The only thing to which I find that this people apply a commendable industry is playing upon musical instruments; in which they are incomparably more skilful than any other nation I have ever seen. For their modulation on these instruments, unlike that of the Britons to which I am accustomed, is not slow and harsh, but lively and rapid, while the harmony is both sweet and gay. It is astonishing that in so complex and rapid a movement of the fingers, the musical proportions can be preserved... it must be remarked, however, that both Scotland and Wales strive to rival Ireland in the art of music...\nGerald's works on Ireland, although invaluable for their detail, are tremendously biased, and have been extensively criticised by writers such as Stephen White. The following passage from his \"Topographia Hibernica\" demonstrates one example of vehement anti-Irish sentiment that reverberates throughout Gerald's works: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Distinction III *Chapter XXXV (Of the number of persons in this nation who have bodily defects): Moreover, I have never seen in any other nation so many individuals who were born blind, so many lame, maimed or having some natural defect. The persons of those who are well-formed are indeed remarkably fine, nowhere better; but as those who are favoured with the gifts of nature grow up exceedingly handsome, those from whom she withholds them are frightfully ugly. No wonder if among an adulterous and incestuous people, in which both births and marriages are illegitimate, a nation out of the pale of the laws, nature herself should be foully corrupted by perverse habits. It should seem that by the just judgements of God, nature sometimes produces such objects, contrary to her own laws, in order that those who will not regard Him duly by the light of their own consciences, should often have to lament their privations of the exterior and bodily gift of sight.\nGerald was a keen and observant student of natural history, but the value of his observations is lessened by credulity and the inability to distinguish fact from legend. He gives a vivid and accurate description of the last colony of the Eurasian beaver in Wales on the Teifi, but spoils it by repeating the legend that beavers castrate themselves to avoid danger. Likewise, he gives a good description of an osprey fishing, but adds the mythical detail that the bird has one webbed foot. His description of Irish wildlife has been the subject of much adverse comment for its inaccuracies and lapses into fiction but nonetheless, despite its faults, some have argued that it gives an important glimpse of Irish fauna in the 1180s. Certainly the book has valuable details about Irish birds: while the common kingfisher is now common in Ireland, Gerald states clearly that it was not found there in his time: on the other hand the white-throated dipper, which he had evidently not seen before, was very common in Ireland. He also observed the great numbers of birds of prey in Ireland, including the golden eagle and the Eurasian sparrowhawk, which he said were more numerous in Ireland than in England.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was given historical credence well into the 16th century, but is now considered historically unreliable.\nLife and career.\nGeoffrey was born between about 1090 and 1100, in Wales or the Welsh Marches. He had reached the age of majority by 1129 when he is recorded as witnessing a charter.\nGeoffrey refers to himself in his as (Geoffrey of Monmouth), which indicates a significant connection to Monmouth, Wales, and may refer to his birthplace. His works attest to some acquaintance with the place-names of the region. Geoffrey was known to his contemporaries as or variants thereof. The \"Arthur\" in these versions of his name may indicate the name of his father or a nickname based on his scholarly interests.\nEarlier scholars assumed that Geoffrey was Welsh or at least spoke Welsh. His knowledge of this language appears to have been slight, however, and there is no evidence that he was of either Welsh or Cambro-Norman descent. He may have come from the same French-speaking elite of the Welsh border country as Gerald of Wales, Walter Map and Robert, Earl of Gloucester, to whom Geoffrey dedicated versions of his \"History\". Sir Frank Stenton and others have suggested that Geoffrey's parents may have been among the many Bretons who took part in William the Conqueror's conquest and settled in the southeast of Wales. Monmouth had been in the hands of Breton lords since 1075 or 1086, and the names and Arthur were more common among the Bretons than the Welsh.\nHis ethnicity has been heavily debated by scholars. Some of the possibilities include Welsh, Breton, Norman, or even Cornish descent.\nHe may have served for a while in the Benedictine Monmouth Priory, but most of his adult life appears to have been spent outside Wales. Between 1129 and 1151, his name appears on six charters in the Oxford area, sometimes styled (teacher). He was probably a secular canon of St. George's college. All the charters signed by Geoffrey are also signed by Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford, a canon at that church. Another frequent co-signatory is Ralph of Monmouth, a canon of Lincoln.\nArchbishop Theobald of Bec consecrated Geoffrey as Bishop of St Asaph at Lambeth on 24 February 1152, having ordained him a priest at Westminster 10 days before. According to Lewis Thorpe, \"There is no evidence that he ever visited his see, and indeed the wars of Owain Gwynedd make this most unlikely.\" He appears to have died between 25 December 1154 and 24 December 1155 according to Welsh chronicles, when his successor took office.\nWorks.\nGeoffrey's structuring and shaping of the Merlin and Arthur myths engendered their vast popularity which continues today, and he is generally viewed by scholars as the major establisher of the Arthurian canon. The \"History\"'s effect on the legend of King Arthur was so vast that Arthurian works have been categorised as \"pre-Galfridian\" and \"post-Galfridian\", depending on whether or not they were influenced by him.\n\"Historia Regum Britanniae\".\nGeoffrey wrote several works in Latin, the language of learning and literature in Europe during the medieval period. His major work was the (\"The History of the Kings of Britain\"), the work best known to modern readers. It relates the purported history of Britain, from its first settlement by Brutus of Troy, a descendant of Trojan hero Aeneas, to the death of Cadwaladr in the 7th century, covering Julius Caesar's invasions of Britain, kings Leir and Cymbeline, and one of the earliest developed narratives of King Arthur.\nGeoffrey claims in his dedication that the book is a translation of an \"ancient book in the British language that told in orderly fashion the deeds of all the kings of Britain\", given to him by Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford, but modern historians have dismissed this claim. It is likely, however, that the Archdeacon did furnish Geoffrey with some materials in the Welsh language which helped inspire his work, as Geoffrey's position and acquaintance with him would not have permitted him to fabricate such a claim outright. Much of it is based on the \"Historia Britonum\", a 9th-century Welsh-Latin historical compilation, Bede's \"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\", and Gildas's 6th-century polemic , expanded with material from bardic oral tradition and genealogical tracts, and embellished by Geoffrey's own imagination. In an exchange of manuscript material for their own histories, Robert of Torigny gave Henry of Huntingdon a copy of \"History\", which both Robert and Henry used uncritically as authentic history and subsequently used in their own works, by which means Geoffrey's fictions became embedded in popular history.\n\"The History of the Kings of Britain\" is now usually considered a literary forgery containing little reliable history. This has since led many modern scholars to agree with William of Newburgh, who wrote around 1190 that \"it is quite clear that everything this man wrote about Arthur and his successors, or indeed about his predecessors from Vortigern onwards, was made up, partly by himself and partly by others.\"\nOther contemporaries were similarly unconvinced by Geoffrey's \"History\". For example, Gerald of Wales recounts the experience of a man possessed by demons: \"If the evil spirits oppressed him too much, the Gospel of St John was placed on his bosom, when, like birds, they immediately vanished; but when the book was removed, and the \"History of the Britons\" by 'Geoffrey Arthur' [as Geoffrey named himself] was substituted in its place, they instantly reappeared in greater numbers, and remained a longer time than usual on his body and on the book.\"\nGeoffrey's major work was nevertheless widely disseminated throughout medieval Western Europe; Acton Griscom listed 186 extant manuscripts in 1929, and others have been identified since. It enjoyed a significant afterlife in a variety of forms, including translations and adaptations such as Wace's Old Norman-French \"Roman de Brut\", Layamon's Middle English \"Brut\", and several anonymous Middle Welsh versions known as \" (\"Brut of the Kings\"\"). where it was generally accepted as a true account.\nIn 2017, Miles Russell published the initial results of the Lost Voices of Celtic Britain Project established at Bournemouth University. The main conclusion of the study was that the \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" appears to contain significant demonstrable archaeological fact, despite being compiled many centuries after the period that it describes. Geoffrey seems to have brought together a disparate mass of source material, including folklore, chronicles, king-lists, dynastic tables, oral tales, and bardic praise poems, some of which was irrevocably garbled or corrupted. In doing so, Geoffrey exercised considerable editorial control, massaging the information and smoothing out apparent inconsistencies in order to create a single grand narrative which fed into the preferred narrative of the Norman rulers of Britain. Much of the information that he used can be shown to be derived from two discrete sources:\nStretching this source material out, chopping, changing and re-editing it in the process, Geoffrey added not just his own fictions but also additional information culled from Roman and early medieval histories and early medieval writers such as Gildas and Bede.\nOther writings.\nGeoffrey's earliest writing was probably the \"\" (\"Prophecies of Merlin\") which he wrote before 1135, and which appears both independently and incorporated into \"The History of the Kings of Britain\". It consists of a series of obscure prophetic utterances attributed to Merlin which he claimed to have translated from an unspecified language.\nThe third work attributed to Geoffrey is the hexameter poem (\"Life of Merlin\"), based more closely on traditional material about Merlin than the other works. Here he is known as Merlin of the Woods (\"Merlinus Sylvestris\") or Scottish Merlin (\"Merlinus Caledonius\") and is portrayed as an old man living as a crazed and grief-stricken outcast in the forest. The story is set long after the timeframe of the \"History\"'s Merlin, but the author tries to synchronise the works with references to the mad prophet's previous dealings with Vortigern and Arthur. The \"Vita\" did not circulate widely, and the attribution to Geoffrey appears in only one late-13th-century manuscript, but it contains recognisably Galfridian elements in its construction and content, and most critics recognise it as his.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the 2008 BBC series \"Merlin\", the character of Geoffrey of Monmouth was played by Michael Cronin.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography "}
{"id": "56356", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56356", "title": "Llandaff", "text": "District and community of Cardiff, Wales\nLlandaff (; ; from 'church' and \"Taf\") is a district, community and coterminous electoral ward in the north of Cardiff, capital of Wales. It was incorporated into the city in 1922. It is the seat of the Bishop of Llandaff, whose diocese within the Church in Wales covers the most populous area of Wales.\nHistory.\nMost of the history of Llandaff centres on its role as a religious site. Before the creation of Llandaff Cathedral, it became established as a Christian place of worship in the 6th century AD, probably because of its location as the first firm ground north of the point where the river Taff met the Bristol Channel, and because of its pre-Christian location as a river crossing on a north\u2013south trade route. Evidence of Romano-British ritual burials have been found under the present cathedral. The date of the moving of the cathedral to Llandaff is disputed, but elements of the fabric date from the 12th century, such as the impressive Romanesque Urban Arch, named after the 12th century Bishop, Urban. It has had a history of continual destruction and restoration, as a result of warfare, neglect, and natural disaster. Llandaff has been a focal point of devastating attacks by Owain Glynd\u0175r and Oliver Cromwell. It was the second most damaged cathedral in the UK (after Coventry Cathedral), following Luftwaffe bombing during World War II, and subsequently restored by the architect George Pace. One of its main modern points of interest is the aluminium figure of \"Christ in Majesty\" (1954\u20135), by Jacob Epstein, which is suspended above the nave. In 2007, a lightning strike to its spire sent a surge through the building; which destroyed its organ. Its replacement, the largest to be built in the UK for over 40 years, was inaugurated in 2010.\nThe Bishop's Palace, also known as Llandaff Castle or Bishop's Castle now in ruins, lies to the south of the cathedral. It is believed it was constructed at a similar date to Caerphilly Castle, in the late 13th century. It is also believed it was abandoned after being attacked and damaged by Glynd\u0175r in the 15th century. The gatehouse of the Palace survives, and the courtyard is now a public garden.\nLlandaff never developed into a chartered borough, and by the 19th century, was described as \"reduced to a mere village... It consists of little more than two short streets of cottages, not lighted or paved, terminating in a square, into which the great gateway of the old palace formerly opened, and where are still several genteel houses.\"\nHistorically, Llandaff was informally known as a 'city', because of its status as the seat of the Bishop of Llandaff. This city status was never officially recognised, largely because the community did not possess a charter of incorporation. The ancient parish of Llandaff included a wide area. Apart from Llandaff itself, it included the townships of Canton, Ely, Fairwater, and Gabalfa.\nDuring the development of the South Wales coalfield and Cardiff Docks, the parish was gradually absorbed into the Borough of Cardiff during the 19th and 20th centuries. Seen as a clean and green up-market countrified village location close to the fast developing city, many of the better-off coal merchants and business people chose to live in Llandaff, including the Insole family. The house now known as Insole Court dates originally from 1856. Llandaff itself became a civil parish, and from 1894 to 1922, was part of the Llandaff and Dinas Powis Rural District. On 9 November 1922, the county borough of Cardiff was extended to include the area.\n1952 mid-air collision.\nOn Monday 14 July 1952 at 1.15pm, two de Havilland Vampire aircraft from RAF Merryfield, of 208 Advanced Flying School, collided in mid-air at 29,000\u00a0ft. One Vampire, \"VF265\", went straight through a three-storey building next to the Llandaff Hotel, to the basement, killing a 53 year old woman. Another Vampire, \"TG297\", crashed in Pontcanna Fields &amp; Llandaff Fields.\nPilot Officer G H Patterson, from the \"VF265\" aircraft, from Houghton-le-Spring, landed in the middle of Cardiff Airport, and walked to Cardiff Aeroplane Club. Pilot Officer B F Shaw, from the \"TG297\" aircraft, from West Sussex, landed in the River Rumney.\nDemography.\nAt the United Kingdom Census 2011, the population of the Llandaff was 8,997; of whom 4,309 were male, and 4,688 female. 91.6% were recorded as being of various white ethnicities. Approximately 65% of the population were returned as Christian, with about 1.5% each being Hindu or Muslim, and 30% having no religion or no stated religion.\nWelsh language.\nIn the 2011 census, 15.3% of the population over 3 years old in Llandaff were recorded as speaking Welsh, or 1,337 people. This was a small drop compared to the 2001 census figure, which was 15.4%.\nBroadcasting House in Llandaff was the headquarters of BBC Cymru Wales until it relocated to Central Square in Cardiff between October 2019 and July 2020.\nResearch by Owen John Thomas shows the historical strength of the Welsh language in Llandaff. According to his book (\"The Welsh language in Cardiff c.\u20091800\u20131914\"), the nonconformist church in Cardiff Road was a Welsh-language church in 1813. His work also shows that Welsh was the main language of the street in Llandaff in the 17th century.\nGovernance.\nLlandaff is both an electoral ward, and a community () of the City of Cardiff. There is no community council for the area. The electoral ward of Llandaff is bounded by Radyr &amp; Morganstown to the north west; Llandaff North to the north; Riverside to the south east; Canton to the south; and Fairwater to the west. The ward is represented by two councillors on Cardiff Council, Sean Driscoll and Peter Huw Jenkins, the former is a member of the Conservative Party, the latter is a member of the Labour Party.\nIn the UK Parliament, Llandaff is part of the constituency of Cardiff West. Its most prominent MPs were former Speaker of the House of Commons; George Thomas, and former First Minister of Wales and Welsh Labour Party leader Rhodri Morgan.\nIn the Senedd, Llandaff is part of the constituency of Cardiff West, whose MS since 2011 is Mark Drakeford of Labour; he succeeded Rhodri Morgan upon the latter's retirement. The constituency is within the electoral region of South Wales Central, whose four current MSs are Conservatives Andrew RT Davies and Joel James; Plaid Cymru's Rhys ab Owen and Heledd Fychan.\nTransport.\nLlandaff is served by railway stations at Danescourt, Fairwater, and Waun-Gron Park; each is about a mile from the cathedral. There is a half-hourly service to and from Cardiff on the Cardiff City Line. Llandaf railway station is located in Llandaff North.\nCardiff Bus services 1/2 (\"City Circle\"), 24/25 (Whitchurch), 62/63 (Radyr/Morganstown), 64/65 (Heath Hospital/Llanrumney), 66 (Danescourt), and Stagecoach service 122 (Tonypandy) operate through the area to/from Cardiff city centre.\nWestern Avenue (A48) runs through the south of the area, heading eastbound to Gabalfa and M4 J29, and westbound to Ely, Culverhouse Cross, and M4 J33. Cardiff Road leads south towards Cardiff city centre.\nEconomy.\nThe major employment sectors in the area are:\nBroadcasting House, formerly the headquarters of BBC Cymru Wales, was opened in Llandaff in 1966. BBC Cymru Wales moved to new facilities at Central Square, Cardiff in 2020, with the remaining Llandaff site due for housing development.\n\"Doctor Who\".\nFollowing its revival in 2005, the long-running science-fiction television series \"Doctor Who\" was produced by BBC Wales in Llandaff. Production was relocated to the BBC's new Roath Lock studios in Cardiff Bay in 2012. The location scenes of four episodes were filmed in Llandaff:\nLlandaff Festival.\nThe Llandaff Cathedral Festival was founded in 1958 and ran annually until 1986. It played an important role in Welsh (and Cardiff) music before the building of St David's Hall in 1982, commissioning large orchestral and choral works (from Alun Hoddinott, Arwel Hughes, Daniel Jones, Norman Kay, William Mathias, Grace Williams and others) and attracting international soloists for chamber music and piano recitals. The event was briefly revived between 2008 and 2013. After a gap of nine years the festival was revived once again in 2022 as a four day event, and has been held annually since then.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A linear subspace is usually simply called a \"subspace\" when the context serves to distinguish it from other types of subspaces.\nDefinition.\nIf \"V\" is a vector space over a field \"K\", a subset \"W\" of \"V\" is a linear subspace of \"V\" if it is a vector space over \"K\" for the operations of \"V\". Equivalently, a linear subspace of \"V\" is a nonempty subset \"W\" such that, whenever \"w\"1, \"w\"2 are elements of \"W\" and \"\u03b1\", \"\u03b2\" are elements of \"K\", it follows that \"\u03b1w\"1 + \"\u03b2w\"2 is in \"W\".\nThe singleton set consisting of the zero vector alone and the entire vector space itself are linear subspaces that are called the trivial subspaces of the vector space.\nExamples.\nExample I.\nIn the vector space \"V\" = R3 (the real coordinate space over the field R of real numbers), take \"W\" to be the set of all vectors in \"V\" whose last component is 0.\nThen \"W\" is a subspace of \"V\".\n\"Proof:\"\nExample II.\nLet the field be R again, but now let the vector space \"V\" be the Cartesian plane R2.\nTake \"W\" to be the set of points (\"x\", \"y\") of R2 such that \"x\" = \"y\".\nThen \"W\" is a subspace of R2.\n\"Proof:\"\nIn general, any subset of the real coordinate space R\"n\" that is defined by a homogeneous system of linear equations will yield a subspace.\nExample III.\nAgain take the field to be R, but now let the vector space \"V\" be the set RR of all functions from R to R.\nLet C(R) be the subset consisting of continuous functions.\nThen C(R) is a subspace of RR.\n\"Proof:\"\nExample IV.\nKeep the same field and vector space as before, but now consider the set Diff(R) of all differentiable functions.\nThe same sort of argument as before shows that this is a subspace too.\nExamples that extend these themes are common in functional analysis.\nProperties of subspaces.\nFrom the definition of vector spaces, it follows that subspaces are nonempty, and are closed under sums and under scalar multiples. Equivalently, subspaces can be characterized by the property of being closed under linear combinations. That is, a nonempty set \"W\" is a subspace if and only if every linear combination of finitely many elements of \"W\" also belongs to \"W\".\nThe equivalent definition states that it is also equivalent to consider linear combinations of two elements at a time.\nIn a topological vector space \"X\", a subspace \"W\" need not be topologically closed, but a finite-dimensional subspace is always closed. The same is true for subspaces of finite codimension (i.e., subspaces determined by a finite number of continuous linear functionals).\nDescriptions.\nDescriptions of subspaces include the solution set to a homogeneous system of linear equations, the subset of Euclidean space described by a system of homogeneous linear parametric equations, the span of a collection of vectors, and the null space, column space, and row space of a matrix. Geometrically (especially over the field of real numbers and its subfields), a subspace is a flat in an \"n\"-space that passes through the origin.\nA natural description of a 1-subspace is the scalar multiplication of one non-zero vector v to all possible scalar values. 1-subspaces specified by two vectors are equal if and only if one vector can be obtained from another with scalar multiplication:\nformula_1\nThis idea is generalized for higher dimensions with linear span, but criteria for equality of \"k\"-spaces specified by sets of \"k\" vectors are not so simple.\nA dual description is provided with linear functionals (usually implemented as linear equations). One non-zero linear functional F specifies its kernel subspace F\u00a0=\u00a00 of codimension 1. Subspaces of codimension 1 specified by two linear functionals are equal, if and only if one functional can be obtained from another with scalar multiplication (in the dual space):\nformula_2\nIt is generalized for higher codimensions with a system of equations. The following two subsections will present this latter description in details, and the remaining four subsections further describe the idea of linear span.\nSystems of linear equations.\nThe solution set to any homogeneous system of linear equations with \"n\" variables is a subspace in the coordinate space \"K\"\"n\":\nformula_3\nFor example, the set of all vectors (\"x\", \"y\", \"z\") (over real or rational numbers) satisfying the equations\nformula_4\nis a one-dimensional subspace. More generally, that is to say that given a set of \"n\" independent functions, the dimension of the subspace in \"K\"\"k\" will be the dimension of the null set of \"A\", the composite matrix of the \"n\" functions.\nNull space of a matrix.\nIn a finite-dimensional space, a homogeneous system of linear equations can be written as a single matrix equation:\nformula_5\nThe set of solutions to this equation is known as the null space of the matrix. For example, the subspace described above is the null space of the matrix\nformula_6\nEvery subspace of \"K\"\"n\" can be described as the null space of some matrix (see below for more).\nLinear parametric equations.\nThe subset of \"K\"\"n\" described by a system of homogeneous linear parametric equations is a subspace:\nformula_7\nFor example, the set of all vectors (\"x\",\u00a0\"y\",\u00a0\"z\") parameterized by the equations\nformula_8\nis a two-dimensional subspace of \"K\"3, if \"K\" is a number field (such as real or rational numbers).\nSpan of vectors.\nIn linear algebra, the system of parametric equations can be written as a single vector equation:\nformula_9\nThe expression on the right is called a linear combination of the vectors\n(2,\u00a05,\u00a0\u22121) and (3,\u00a0\u22124,\u00a02). These two vectors are said to span the resulting subspace.\nIn general, a linear combination of vectors v1,\u00a0v2,\u00a0...\u00a0,\u00a0v\"k\" is any vector of the form\nformula_10\nThe set of all possible linear combinations is called the span:\nformula_11\nIf the vectors v1,\u00a0...\u00a0,\u00a0v\"k\" have \"n\" components, then their span is a subspace of \"K\"\"n\". Geometrically, the span is the flat through the origin in \"n\"-dimensional space determined by the points v1,\u00a0...\u00a0,\u00a0v\"k\".\n The \"xz\"-plane in R3 can be parameterized by the equations\nformula_12\nAs a subspace, the \"xz\"-plane is spanned by the vectors (1,\u00a00,\u00a00) and (0,\u00a00,\u00a01). Every vector in the \"xz\"-plane can be written as a linear combination of these two:\nformula_13\nGeometrically, this corresponds to the fact that every point on the \"xz\"-plane can be reached from the origin by first moving some distance in the direction of (1,\u00a00,\u00a00) and then moving some distance in the direction of (0,\u00a00,\u00a01).\nColumn space and row space.\nA system of linear parametric equations in a finite-dimensional space can also be written as a single matrix equation:\nformula_14\nIn this case, the subspace consists of all possible values of the vector x. In linear algebra, this subspace is known as the column space (or image) of the matrix \"A\". It is precisely the subspace of \"K\"\"n\" spanned by the column vectors of \"A\".\nThe row space of a matrix is the subspace spanned by its row vectors. The row space is interesting because it is the orthogonal complement of the null space (see below).\nIndependence, basis, and dimension.\nIn general, a subspace of \"K\"\"n\" determined by \"k\" parameters (or spanned by \"k\" vectors) has dimension \"k\". However, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, the subspace of \"K\"3 spanned by the three vectors (1,\u00a00,\u00a00), (0,\u00a00,\u00a01), and (2,\u00a00,\u00a03) is just the \"xz\"-plane, with each point on the plane described by infinitely many different values of \"t\"1, \"t\"2, \"t\"3.\nIn general, vectors v1,\u00a0...\u00a0,\u00a0v\"k\" are called linearly independent if\nformula_15\nfor\n(\"t\"1,\u00a0\"t\"2,\u00a0...\u00a0,\u00a0\"tk\")\u00a0\u2260 (\"u\"1,\u00a0\"u\"2,\u00a0...\u00a0,\u00a0\"uk\").\nIf v1, ..., v\"k\" are linearly independent, then the coordinates \"t\"1, ..., \"tk\" for a vector in the span are uniquely determined.\nA basis for a subspace \"S\" is a set of linearly independent vectors whose span is \"S\". The number of elements in a basis is always equal to the geometric dimension of the subspace. Any spanning set for a subspace can be changed into a basis by removing redundant vectors (see \u00a7 Algorithms below for more).\n Let \"S\" be the subspace of R4 defined by the equations\nformula_16\nThen the vectors (2,\u00a01,\u00a00,\u00a00) and (0,\u00a00,\u00a05,\u00a01) are a basis for \"S\". In particular, every vector that satisfies the above equations can be written uniquely as a linear combination of the two basis vectors:\nformula_17\nThe subspace \"S\" is two-dimensional. Geometrically, it is the plane in R4 passing through the points (0,\u00a00,\u00a00,\u00a00), (2,\u00a01,\u00a00,\u00a00), and (0,\u00a00,\u00a05,\u00a01).\nOperations and relations on subspaces.\nInclusion.\nThe set-theoretical inclusion binary relation specifies a partial order on the set of all subspaces (of any dimension).\nA subspace cannot lie in any subspace of lesser dimension. If dim\u00a0\"U\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"k\", a finite number, and \"U\"\u00a0\u2282\u00a0\"W\", then dim\u00a0\"W\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"k\" if and only if \"U\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"W\".\nIntersection.\nGiven subspaces \"U\" and \"W\" of a vector space \"V\", then their intersection \"U\"\u00a0\u2229\u00a0\"W\"\u00a0:= {v\u00a0\u2208\u00a0\"V\"\u00a0: v\u00a0is an element of both \"U\" and\u00a0\"W\"} is also a subspace of \"V\".\n\"Proof:\"\nFor every vector space \"V\", the set {0} and \"V\" itself are subspaces of \"V\".\nSum.\nIf \"U\" and \"W\" are subspaces, their sum is the subspace\nformula_18\nFor example, the sum of two lines is the plane that contains them both. The dimension of the sum satisfies the inequality\nformula_19\nHere, the minimum only occurs if one subspace is contained in the other, while the maximum is the most general case. The dimension of the intersection and the sum are related by the following equation:\nformula_20\nA set of subspaces is independent when the only intersection between any pair of subspaces is the trivial subspace. The direct sum is the sum of independent subspaces, written as formula_21. An equivalent restatement is that a direct sum is a subspace sum under the condition that every subspace contributes to the span of the sum.\nThe dimension of a direct sum formula_21 is the same as the sum of subspaces, but may be shortened because the dimension of the trivial subspace is zero.\nformula_23\nLattice of subspaces.\nThe operations intersection and sum make the set of all subspaces a bounded modular lattice, where the {0} subspace, the least element, is an identity element of the sum operation, and the identical subspace \"V\", the greatest element, is an identity element of the intersection operation.\nOrthogonal complements.\nIf formula_24 is an inner product space and formula_25 is a subset of formula_24, then the orthogonal complement of formula_25, denoted formula_28, is again a subspace. If formula_24 is finite-dimensional and formula_25 is a subspace, then the dimensions of formula_25 and formula_28 satisfy the complementary relationship formula_33. Moreover, no vector is orthogonal to itself, so formula_34 and formula_24 is the direct sum of formula_25 and formula_28. Applying orthogonal complements twice returns the original subspace: formula_38 for every subspace formula_25.\nThis operation, understood as negation (formula_40), makes the lattice of subspaces a (possibly infinite) orthocomplemented lattice (although not a distributive lattice).\nIn spaces with other bilinear forms, some but not all of these results still hold. In pseudo-Euclidean spaces and symplectic vector spaces, for example, orthogonal complements exist. However, these spaces may have null vectors that are orthogonal to themselves, and consequently there exist subspaces formula_25 such that formula_42. As a result, this operation does not turn the lattice of subspaces into a Boolean algebra (nor a Heyting algebra).\nAlgorithms.\nMost algorithms for dealing with subspaces involve row reduction. This is the process of applying elementary row operations to a matrix, until it reaches either row echelon form or reduced row echelon form. Row reduction has the following important properties:\nInput An \"m\"\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\"n\" matrix \"A\".\nOutput A basis for the row space of \"A\".\n# Use elementary row operations to put \"A\" into row echelon form.\n# The nonzero rows of the echelon form are a basis for the row space of \"A\".\nBasis for a row space.\nSee the article on row space for an example.\nIf we instead put the matrix \"A\" into reduced row echelon form, then the resulting basis for the row space is uniquely determined. This provides an algorithm for checking whether two row spaces are equal and, by extension, whether two subspaces of \"K\"\"n\" are equal.\nInput A basis {b1, b2, ..., b\"k\"} for a subspace \"S\" of \"K\"\"n\", and a vector v with \"n\" components.\nOutput Determines whether v is an element of \"S\"\n# Create a (\"k\"\u00a0+\u00a01)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\"n\" matrix \"A\" whose rows are the vectors b1,\u00a0...\u00a0,\u00a0b\"k\" and v.\n# Use elementary row operations to put \"A\" into row echelon form.\n# If the echelon form has a row of zeroes, then the vectors {b1, ..., b\"k\", v} are linearly dependent, and therefore v \u2208 \"S\".\nInput An \"m\"\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\"n\" matrix \"A\"\nOutput A basis for the column space of \"A\"\n# Use elementary row operations to put \"A\" into row echelon form.\n# Determine which columns of the echelon form have pivots. The corresponding columns of the original matrix are a basis for the column space.\nBasis for a column space.\nSee the article on column space for an example.\nThis produces a basis for the column space that is a subset of the original column vectors. It works because the columns with pivots are a basis for the column space of the echelon form, and row reduction does not change the linear dependence relationships between the columns.\nInput A basis {b1, b2, ..., b\"k\"} for a subspace \"S\" of \"K\"\"n\", and a vector v \u2208 \"S\"\nOutput Numbers \"t\"1, \"t\"2, ..., \"t\"\"k\" such that v = \"t\"1b1 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \"t\"\"k\"b\"k\"\n# Create an augmented matrix \"A\" whose columns are b1...,b\"k\" , with the last column being v.\n# Use elementary row operations to put \"A\" into reduced row echelon form.\n# Express the final column of the reduced echelon form as a linear combination of the first \"k\" columns. The coefficients used are the desired numbers \"t\"1, \"t\"2, ..., \"t\"\"k\". (These should be precisely the first \"k\" entries in the final column of the reduced echelon form.)\nCoordinates for a vector.\nIf the final column of the reduced row echelon form contains a pivot, then the input vector v does not lie in \"S\".\nInput An \"m\"\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\"n\" matrix \"A\".\nOutput A basis for the null space of \"A\"\n# Use elementary row operations to put \"A\" in reduced row echelon form.\n# Using the reduced row echelon form, determine which of the variables \"x\"1, \"x\"2, ..., \"xn\" are free. Write equations for the dependent variables in terms of the free variables.\n# For each free variable \"xi\", choose a vector in the null space for which \"xi\" = 1 and the remaining free variables are zero. The resulting collection of vectors is a basis for the null space of \"A\".\nBasis for a null space.\nSee the article on null space for an example.\nBasis for the sum and intersection of two subspaces.\nGiven two subspaces U and W of V, a basis of the sum formula_43 and the intersection formula_44 can be calculated using the Zassenhaus algorithm.\nInput A basis {b1, b2, ..., b\"k\"} for a subspace \"S\" of \"K\"\"n\"\nOutput An (\"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"k\")\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\"n\" matrix whose null space is \"S\".\n# Create a matrix \"A\" whose rows are b1, b2, ..., b\"k\".\n# Use elementary row operations to put \"A\" into reduced row echelon form.\n# Let c1, c2, ..., c\"n\" be the columns of the reduced row echelon form. For each column without a pivot, write an equation expressing the column as a linear combination of the columns with pivots.\n# This results in a homogeneous system of \"n\" \u2212 \"k\" linear equations involving the variables c1...,c\"n\". The (\"n\" \u2212 \"k\") \u00d7 \"n\" matrix corresponding to this system is the desired matrix with nullspace \"S\".\nIf the reduced row echelon form of \"A\" is\nformula_45\nthen the column vectors c1, ..., c6 satisfy the equations\nformula_46\nIt follows that the row vectors of \"A\" satisfy the equations\nformula_47\nIn particular, the row vectors of \"A\" are a basis for the null space of the corresponding matrix.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He conceived the nuclear chain reaction in 1933, and patented the idea in 1936. In late 1939 he wrote the letter for Albert Einstein's signature that resulted in the Manhattan Project that built the atomic bomb, and then in 1945 wrote the Szilard petition asking president Harry S. Truman to demonstrate the bomb without dropping it on civilians. According to Gy\u00f6rgy Marx, he was one of the Hungarian scientists known as The Martians.\nSzilard initially attended Palatine Joseph Technical University in Budapest, but his engineering studies were interrupted by service in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. He left Hungary for Germany in 1919, enrolling at Technische Hochschule (Institute of Technology) in Berlin-Charlottenburg (now Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin), but became bored with engineering and transferred to Friedrich Wilhelm University, where he studied physics. He wrote his doctoral thesis on Maxwell's demon, a long-standing puzzle in the philosophy of thermal and statistical physics. Szilard was the first scientist of note to recognize the connection between thermodynamics and information theory.\nSzilard coined and submitted the earliest known patent applications and the first publications for the concept of the electron microscope (1928), the cyclotron (1929), and also contributed to the development of the linear accelerator (1928) in Germany. Between 1926 and 1930, he worked with Einstein on the development of the Einstein refrigerator. After Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany in 1933, Szilard urged his family and friends to flee Europe while they still could. He moved to England, where he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs. While in England, he discovered a means of isotope separation known as the Szilard\u2013Chalmers effect, alongside Thomas A. Chalmers.\nForeseeing another war in Europe, Szilard moved to the United States in 1938, where he worked with Enrico Fermi and Walter Zinn on means of creating a nuclear chain reaction. He was present when this was achieved within the Chicago Pile-1 on December 2, 1942. He worked for the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago on aspects of nuclear reactor design, where he was the chief physicist. He drafted the Szilard petition advocating a non-lethal demonstration of the atomic bomb, but the Interim Committee chose to use them in a military strike instead.\nTogether with Enrico Fermi, he applied for a nuclear reactor patent in 1944. He publicly sounded the alarm against the possible development of salted thermonuclear bombs, a new kind of nuclear weapon that might annihilate mankind. His inventions, discoveries, and contributions related to biological science are also equally important; they include the discovery of feedback inhibition and the invention of the chemostat. According to Theodore Puck and Philip I. Marcus, Szilard gave essential advice which made the earliest cloning of the human cell a reality.\nDiagnosed with bladder cancer in 1960, he underwent a cobalt-60 treatment that he had designed. He helped found the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he became a resident fellow. Szilard founded Council for a Livable World in 1962 to deliver \"the sweet voice of reason\" about nuclear weapons to Congress, the White House, and the American public. He died in his sleep of a heart attack in 1964.\nEarly life.\nHe was born as Le\u00f3 Spitz in Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary, on February 11, 1898. His middle-class Jewish parents, Lajos (Louis) Spitz, a civil engineer, and Tekla Vidor, raised Le\u00f3 on the V\u00e1rosligeti Fasor in Pest. He had two younger siblings, a brother, B\u00e9la, born in 1900, and a sister, R\u00f3zsi, born in 1901. On October 4, 1900, the family changed its surname from the German \"Spitz\" to the Hungarian \"Szil\u00e1rd\", a name that means \"solid\" in Hungarian. Despite having a religious background, Szilard became an agnostic. From 1908 to 1916 he attended F\u00f6re\u00e1liskola (high school) in Budapest's 6th District . Showing an early interest in physics and a proficiency in mathematics, in 1916 he won the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Prize, a national prize for mathematics.\nWith World War I raging in Europe, Szilard received notice on January 22, 1916, that he had been drafted into the 5th Fortress Regiment, but he was able to continue his studies. He enrolled as an engineering student at the Palatine Joseph Technical University, which he entered in September 1916. The following year he joined the Austro-Hungarian Army's 4th Mountain Artillery Regiment, but immediately was sent to Budapest as an officer candidate. He rejoined his regiment in May 1918 but in September, before being sent to the front, he fell ill with Spanish Influenza and was returned home for hospitalization. Later he was informed that his regiment had been nearly annihilated in battle, so the illness probably saved his life. He was discharged honorably in November 1918, after the Armistice.\nIn January 1919, Szilard resumed his engineering studies, but Hungary was in a chaotic political situation with the rise of the Hungarian Soviet Republic under B\u00e9la Kun. Szilard and his brother B\u00e9la founded their own political group, the Hungarian Association of Socialist Students, with a platform based on a scheme of Szilard's for taxation reform. He was convinced that socialism was the answer to Hungary's post-war problems, but not that of Kun's Hungarian Socialist Party, which had close ties to the Soviet Union. When Kun's government tottered, the brothers officially changed their religion from \"Israelite\" to \"Calvinist\", but when they attempted to re-enroll in what was now the Budapest University of Technology, they were prevented from doing so by nationalist students because they were Jews.\nTime in Berlin.\nConvinced that there was no future for him in Hungary, Szilard left for Berlin via Austria on December 25, 1919, and enrolled at the Technische Hochschule (Institute of Technology) in Berlin-Charlottenburg. He was soon joined by his brother B\u00e9la. Szilard became bored with engineering, and his attention turned to physics. This was not taught at the Technische Hochschule, so he transferred to Friedrich Wilhelm University, where he attended lectures given by Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Walter Nernst, James Franck and Max von Laue. He also met fellow Hungarian students Eugene Wigner, John von Neumann and Dennis Gabor.\nSzilard's doctoral dissertation on thermodynamics \"\u00dcber die thermodynamischen Schwankungserscheinungen\" (On The Manifestation of Thermodynamic Fluctuations), praised by Einstein, won top honors in 1922. It involved a long-standing puzzle in the philosophy of thermal and statistical physics known as Maxwell's demon, a thought experiment originated by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell. The problem was thought to be insoluble, but in tackling it Szilard recognized the connection between thermodynamics and information theory.\nSzilard was appointed as assistant to von Laue at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1924. In 1927 he finished his habilitation and became a \"Privatdozent\" (private lecturer) in physics. For his habilitation lecture, he produced a second paper on Maxwell's demon, \"\u00dcber die Entropieverminderung in einem thermodynamischen System bei Eingriffen intelligenter Wesen\" (On the reduction of entropy in a thermodynamic system by the intervention of intelligent beings), that had actually been written soon after the first. This introduced the thought experiment now called the Szilard engine and became important in the history of attempts to understand Maxwell's demon. The paper also introduced the first equation linking negative entropy and information. This work established Szilard as a foundational figure in information theory; however, he did not publish it until 1929 and chose not to pursue the topic further. Cybernetics, via the work of Norbert Wiener and Claude E. Shannon, would later develop the concept into a general theory in the 1940s and 1950s\u2014though, during the time of the Cybernetics Meetings, John Von Neumann pointed out that Szilard first equated information with entropy in his review of Wiener's .\nThroughout his time in Berlin, Szilard worked on numerous technical inventions. In 1928 he submitted a patent application for the linear accelerator, not knowing of Gustav Ising's prior 1924 journal article and Rolf Wider\u00f8e's operational device, and in 1929 applied for one for the cyclotron. He was also the first person to conceive the idea of the electron microscope, and submitted the earliest patent for one in 1928. Between 1926 and 1930, he worked with Einstein to develop the Einstein refrigerator, notable because it had no moving parts. He did not build all of these devices, or publish these ideas in scientific journals, and so credit for them often went to others. As a result, Szilard never received the Nobel Prize, but Ernest Lawrence was awarded it for the cyclotron in 1939, and Ernst Ruska for the electron microscope in 1986.\nSzilard received German citizenship in 1930, but was already uneasy about the political situation in Europe. When Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933, Szilard urged his family and friends to flee Europe while they still could. He moved to England, and transferred his savings of \u00a31,595 (\u00a3 today) from his bank in Z\u00fcrich to one in London. He lived in hotels where lodging and meals cost about \u00a35.5 a week. For those less fortunate, he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs, and persuaded the Royal Society to provide accommodation for it at Burlington House. He enlisted the help of academics such as Harald Bohr, G. H. Hardy, Archibald Hill and Frederick G. Donnan. By the outbreak of World War II in 1939, it had helped to find places for over 2,500 refugee scholars.\nNuclear physics.\nOn the morning of September 12, 1933, Szilard read an article in \"The Times\" summarizing a speech given by Lord Rutherford in which Rutherford rejected the feasibility of using atomic energy for practical purposes. The speech remarked specifically on the recent 1932 work of his students, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton, in \"splitting\" lithium into alpha particles, by bombardment with protons from a particle accelerator they had constructed. Rutherford went on to say:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We might in these processes obtain very much more energy than the proton supplied, but on the average we could not expect to obtain energy in this way. It was a very poor and inefficient way of producing energy, and anyone who looked for a source of power in the transformation of the atoms was talking moonshine. But the subject was scientifically interesting because it gave insight into the atoms.\nSzilard was so annoyed at Rutherford's dismissal that, on the same day, he conceived of the idea of nuclear chain reaction (analogous to a chemical chain reaction), using recently discovered neutrons. The idea did not use the mechanism of nuclear fission, which was not yet discovered, but Szilard realized that if neutrons could initiate any sort of energy-producing nuclear reaction, such as the one that had occurred in lithium, and could be produced themselves by the same reaction, energy might be obtained with little input, since the reaction would be self-sustaining. He wanted to carry out a systematic survey of all 92 then-known elements in order to find one that can allow the chain reaction, at an estimated cost of $8000, but he did not for lack of funds.\nSzilard filed for a patent on the concept of the neutron-induced nuclear chain reaction in June 1934, which was granted in March 1936. Under section 30 of the \"Patents and Designs Act\" (1907, UK), Szilard was able to assign the patent to the British Admiralty to ensure its secrecy, which he did. Consequently, his patent was not published until 1949 when the relevant parts of the \"Patents and Designs Act\" (1907, UK) were repealed by the \"Patents and Designs Act\" (July 1949, UK). Richard Rhodes described Szilard's moment of inspiration:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In London, where Southampton Row passes Russell Square, across from the British Museum in Bloomsbury, Leo Szilard waited irritably one gray Depression morning for the stoplight to change. A trace of rain had fallen during the night; Tuesday, September 12, 1933, dawned cool, humid and dull. Drizzling rain would begin again in early afternoon. When Szilard told the story later he never mentioned his destination that morning. He may have had none; he often walked to think. In any case another destination intervened. The stoplight changed to green. Szilard stepped off the curb. As he crossed the street time cracked open before him and he saw a way to the future, death into the world and all our woe, the shape of things to come. \nPrior to conceiving the nuclear chain reaction, in 1932 Szilard had read H. G. Wells' \"The World Set Free\", a book describing continuing explosives which Wells termed \"atomic bombs\"; Szilard wrote in his memoirs the book had made \"a very great impression on me.\" When Szilard assigned his patent to the Admiralty to keep the news from reaching the notice of the wider scientific community, he wrote, \"Knowing what this [a chain reaction] would mean\u2014and I knew it because I had read H. G. Wells\u2014I did not want this patent to become public.\"\nIn early 1934, Szilard began working at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London. Working with a young physicist on the hospital staff, Thomas A. Chalmers, he began studying radioactive isotopes for medical purposes. It was known that bombarding elements with neutrons could produce either heavier isotopes of an element, or a heavier element, a phenomenon known as the Fermi Effect after its discoverer, the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. When they bombarded ethyl iodide with neutrons produced by a radon\u2013beryllium source, they found that the heavier radioactive isotopes of iodine separated from the compound. Thus, they had discovered a means of isotope separation. This method became known as the Szilard\u2013Chalmers effect, and was widely used in the preparation of medical isotopes. He also attempted unsuccessfully to create a nuclear chain reaction using beryllium by bombarding it with X-rays.\nManhattan Project.\nColumbia University.\nSzilard visited B\u00e9la and Rose and her husband Roland (Lorand) Detre, in Switzerland in September 1937. After a rainstorm, he and his siblings spent an afternoon in an unsuccessful attempt to build a prototype collapsible umbrella. One reason for the visit was that he had decided to emigrate to the United States, as he believed that another war in Europe was inevitable and imminent. He reached New York on the liner on January 2, 1938. Over the next few months, he moved from place to place, conducting research with Maurice Goldhaber at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, and then the University of Chicago, University of Michigan and the University of Rochester, where he undertook experiments with indium but again failed to initiate a chain reaction.\nIn early 1938, Szilard would settle down at \"what would become a haven for much of the rest of his life\" when he took a room at the King's Crown Hotel in New York City, being near Columbia University where he now conducted research without a formal title or position. He encountered John R. Dunning, who invited him to speak about his research at an afternoon seminar in January 1939. That same month, Niels Bohr brought news with him to New York that nuclear fission had accidentally been observed by chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin on December 19, 1938. Hahn and Strassman's misunderstanding of their observation would be corrected theoretically and thus explained by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, as Meitner had known of Szilard's theory back in 1933 and after re-conducting the experiment themselves, confirmed Szilard's theory to have been correct all along. When Szilard found out about it on a visit to Wigner at Princeton University, he immediately realized that uranium might be the element capable of sustaining a chain reaction.\nUnable to convince Fermi that this was the case, Szilard set out on his own. He obtained permission from the head of the physics department at Columbia, George B. Pegram, to use a laboratory for three months. To fund his experiment, he borrowed $2,000 from a fellow inventor, Benjamin Liebowitz. He wired Frederick Lindemann at Oxford and asked him to send a beryllium cylinder. He persuaded Walter Zinn to become his collaborator and hired Semyon Krewer to investigate processes for manufacturing pure uranium and graphite.\nSzilard and Zinn conducted a simple experiment on the seventh floor of Pupin Hall at Columbia, using a radium\u2013beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. Initially nothing registered on the oscilloscope, but then Zinn realized that it was not plugged in. On doing so, they discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible. Szilard later described the event: \"We turned the switch and saw the flashes. We watched them for a little while and then we switched everything off and went home.\" He understood the implications and consequences of this discovery, though. \"That night, there was very little doubt in my mind that the world was headed for grief\".\nWhile they had demonstrated that the fission of uranium produced more neutrons than it consumed, this was still not a chain reaction. Szilard persuaded Fermi and Herbert L. Anderson to try a larger experiment using of uranium. To maximize the chance of fission, they needed a neutron moderator to slow the neutrons down. Hydrogen was a known moderator, so they used water. The results were disappointing. It became apparent that hydrogen slowed neutrons down, but also absorbed them, leaving fewer for the chain reaction. Szilard then suggested Fermi use carbon, in the form of graphite. He felt he would need about (50.8 metric ton) of graphite and of uranium. As a back-up plan, Szilard also considered where he might find a few tons of heavy water; deuterium would not absorb neutrons like ordinary hydrogen but would have the similar value as a moderator. Such quantities of material would require a lot of money.\nSzilard drafted a confidential letter to the President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, explaining the possibility of nuclear weapons, warning of the German nuclear weapon project, and encouraging the development of a program that could result in their creation. With the help of Wigner and Edward Teller, he approached his old friend and collaborator Einstein in August 1939, and persuaded him to sign the letter, lending his fame to the proposal. The Einstein\u2013Szil\u00e1rd letter resulted in the establishment of research into nuclear fission by the US government, and ultimately to the creation of the Manhattan Project. Roosevelt gave the letter to his aide, Brigadier General Edwin M. \"Pa\" Watson with the instruction: \"Pa, this requires action!\"\nAn Advisory Committee on Uranium was formed under Lyman J. Briggs, a scientist and the director of the National Bureau of Standards. Its first meeting on October 21, 1939, was attended by Szilard, Teller, and Wigner, who persuaded the Army and Navy to provide $6,000 for Szilard to purchase supplies for experiments\u2014in particular, more graphite. A 1940 Army intelligence report on Fermi and Szilard, prepared when the United States had not yet entered World War II, expressed reservations about both. While it contained some errors of fact about Szilard, it correctly noted his dire prediction that Germany would win the war.\nFermi and Szilard met with Herbert G. MacPherson and V. C. Hamister of the National Carbon Company, who manufactured graphite, and Szilard made another important discovery. He asked about impurities in graphite and learned from MacPherson that it usually contained boron, a neutron absorber. He then had special boron-free graphite produced. Had he not done so, they might have concluded, as the German nuclear researchers did, that graphite was unsuitable for use as a neutron moderator. Like the German researchers, Fermi and Szilard still believed that enormous quantities of uranium would be required for an atomic bomb, and therefore concentrated on producing a controlled chain reaction. Fermi determined that a fissioning uranium atom produced 1.73 neutrons on average. It was enough, but a careful design was called for to minimize losses. Szilard worked up various designs for a nuclear reactor. \"If the uranium project could have been run on ideas alone,\" Wigner later remarked, \"no one but Leo Szilard would have been needed.\"\nMetallurgical Laboratory.\nAt its December 6, 1941, meeting, the National Defense Research Committee resolved to proceed with an all-out effort to produce atomic bombs. This decision was given urgency by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor the following day that brought the United States into World War II. It was formally approved by Roosevelt in January 1942. Arthur H. Compton from the University of Chicago was appointed head of research and development. Against Szilard's wishes, Compton concentrated all the groups working on reactors and plutonium at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago. Compton laid out an ambitious plan to achieve a chain reaction by January 1943, start manufacturing plutonium in nuclear reactors by January 1944, and produce an atomic bomb by January 1945.\nIn January 1942, Szilard joined the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago as a research associate, and later the chief physicist. Alvin Weinberg noted that Szilard served as the project \"gadfly\", asking all the embarrassing questions. Szilard provided important insights. While uranium-238 did not fission readily with slow, moderated neutrons, it might still fission with the fast neutrons produced by fission. This effect was small but crucial. Szilard made suggestions that improved the uranium canning process, and worked with David Gurinsky and Ed Creutz on a method for recovering uranium from its salts.\nA vexing question at the time was how a production reactor should be cooled. Taking a conservative view that every possible neutron must be preserved, the majority opinion initially favored cooling with helium, which would absorb very few neutrons. Szilard argued that if this was a concern, then liquid bismuth would be a better choice. He supervised experiments with it, but the practical difficulties turned out to be too great. In the end, Wigner's plan to use ordinary water as a coolant won out. When the coolant issue became too heated, Compton and the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., moved to dismiss Szilard, who was still a German citizen, but the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, refused to do so. Szilard was therefore present on December 2, 1942, when the first man-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was achieved in the first nuclear reactor under viewing stands of Stagg Field and shook Fermi's hand.\nSzilard started to acquire high-quality graphite and uranium, which were the necessary materials for building a large-scale chain reaction experiment. The success of this demonstration and technological breakthrough at the University of Chicago were partially due to Szilard's new atomic theories, his uranium lattice design, and the identification and mitigation of a key graphite impurity (boron) through a joint collaboration with graphite suppliers.\nSzilard became a naturalized citizen of the United States in March 1943. The Army offered Szilard $25,000 for his inventions before November 1940, when he officially joined the project. He refused. He was the co-holder, with Fermi, of the patent on the nuclear reactor. In the end he sold his patent to the government for reimbursement of his expenses, some $15,416, plus the standard $1 fee. He continued to work with Fermi and Wigner on nuclear reactor design and is credited with coining the term \"breeder reactor\".\nWith an enduring passion for the preservation of human life and political freedom, Szilard hoped that the US government would not use nuclear weapons, but that the mere threat of such weapons would force Germany and Japan to surrender. He also worried about the long-term implications of nuclear weapons, predicting that their use by the United States would start a nuclear arms race with the USSR. He drafted the Szil\u00e1rd petition advocating that the atomic bomb be demonstrated to the enemy, and used only if the enemy did not then surrender. The Interim Committee instead chose to use atomic bombs against cities over the protests of Szilard and other scientists. Afterwards, he lobbied for amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 that placed nuclear energy under civilian control.\nAfter the war.\nIn 1946, Szilard secured a research professorship at the University of Chicago that allowed him to research in biology and the social sciences. He teamed up with Aaron Novick, a chemist who had worked at the Metallurgical Laboratory during the war. The two men saw biology as a field that had not been explored as much as physics and was ready for scientific breakthroughs. It was a field that Szilard had been working on in 1933 before he had become subsumed in the quest for a nuclear chain reaction. The duo made considerable advances. They invented the chemostat, a device for regulating the growth rate of the microorganisms in a bioreactor, and developed methods for measuring the growth rate of bacteria. They discovered feedback inhibition, an important factor in processes such as growth and metabolism. Szilard gave essential advice to Theodore Puck and Philip I. Marcus for their first cloning of a human cell in 1955.\nPersonal life.\nBefore his relationship with his later wife Gertrud \"Trude\" Weiss, Leo Szilard's life partner in the period 1927\u20131934 was the kindergarten teacher and opera singer Gerda Philipsborn, who also worked as a volunteer in a Berlin asylum organization for refugee children and in 1932 moved to India to continue this work. Szilard married Trude Weiss, a physician, in a civil ceremony in New York on October 13, 1951. They had known each other since 1929 and had frequently corresponded and visited each other ever since. Weiss took up a teaching position at the University of Colorado in April 1950, and Szilard began staying with her in Denver for weeks at a time when they had never been together for more than a few days before. Single people living together was frowned upon in the conservative United States at the time and, after they were discovered by one of her students, Szilard began to worry that she might lose her job. Their relationship remained a long-distance one, and they kept news of their marriage quiet. Many of his friends were shocked, having considered Szilard a born bachelor.\nWritings.\nIn 1949 Szilard wrote a short story titled \"My Trial as a War Criminal\" in which he imagined himself on trial for crimes against humanity after the United States lost a war with the Soviet Union. He publicly sounded the alarm against the possible development of salted thermonuclear bombs, explaining in a University of Chicago Round Table radio program on February 26, 1950, that a sufficiently big thermonuclear bomb rigged with specific but common materials, might annihilate mankind. His comments, as well as those of Hans Bethe, Harrison Brown, and Frederick Seitz (the three other scientists who participated in the program), were attacked by the Atomic Energy Commission's former Chairman David Lilienthal, and the criticisms plus a response from Szilard were published. \"Time\" compared Szilard to Chicken Little while the AEC dismissed his ideas, but scientists debated whether it was feasible or not; the \"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\" commissioned a study by James R. Arnold, who concluded that it was. Physicist W. H. Clark suggested that a 50\u00a0megaton cobalt bomb did have the potential to produce sufficient long-lasting radiation to be a doomsday weapon, in theory, but was of the view that, even then, \"enough people might find refuge to wait out the radioactivity and emerge to begin again.\"\nIn 1961 he proposed the idea of \"Mined Cities\", an early example of mutually assured destruction.\nSzilard published a book of short stories, \"The Voice of the Dolphins\" (1961), in which he dealt with the moral and ethical issues raised by the Cold War and his own role in the development of atomic weapons. The title story described an international biology research laboratory in Central Europe. This became reality after a meeting in 1962 with Victor F. Weisskopf, James Watson and John Kendrew. When the European Molecular Biology Laboratory was established, the library was named The Szilard Library and the library stamp features dolphins. Other honors that he received included the Atoms for Peace Award in 1959, and the Humanist of the Year in 1960. A lunar crater on the far side of the Moon was named after him in 1970. The Leo Szilard Lectureship Award, established in 1974, is given in his honor by the American Physical Society.\nCancer diagnosis and treatment.\nIn 1960, Szilard was diagnosed with bladder cancer. He underwent cobalt therapy at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital using a cobalt 60 treatment regimen that his doctors gave him a high degree of control over. A second round of treatment with an increased dose followed in 1962. The higher dose did its job and his cancer never returned.\nLast years.\nSzilard spent his last years as a fellow of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in the La Jolla community of San Diego, California, which he had helped create. Szilard founded Council for a Livable World in 1962 to deliver \"the sweet voice of reason\" about nuclear weapons to Congress, the White House, and the American public. He was appointed a non-resident fellow there in July 1963, and became a resident fellow on April 1, 1964, after moving to San Diego in February. With Trude, he lived in a bungalow on the property of the Hotel del Charro. On May 30, 1964, he died there in his sleep of a heart attack; when Trude awoke, she was unable to revive him. His remains were cremated.\nHis papers are in the library at the University of California, San Diego. In February 2014, the library announced that it received funding from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission to digitize its collection of his papers, ranging from 1938 to 1998.\nIn media.\nSzilard was portrayed in the 2023 Christopher Nolan film \"Oppenheimer\" by M\u00e1t\u00e9 Haumann. Szilard was also the subject of a musical entitled \"Atomic\". A 1992 biography by William Lanouette, titled \"Genius in the Shadows: A Biography of Leo Szilard, the Man Behind the Bomb\", covers Szilard's personal life and his work.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "56360", "revid": "48622226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56360", "title": "Sorbitol", "text": "&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nSorbitol (), less commonly known as glucitol (), is a sugar alcohol with a sweet taste which the human body metabolizes slowly. It can be obtained by reduction of glucose, which changes the converted aldehyde group (\u2212CHO) to a primary alcohol group (\u2212CH2OH). Most sorbitol is made from potato starch, but it is also found in nature, for example in apples, pears, peaches, and prunes. It is converted to fructose by sorbitol-6-phosphate 2-dehydrogenase. Sorbitol is an isomer of mannitol, another sugar alcohol; the two differ only in the orientation of the hydroxyl group on carbon2. While similar, the two sugar alcohols have very different sources in nature, melting points, and uses.\nAs an over-the-counter drug, sorbitol is used as a laxative to treat constipation.\nSynthesis.\nSorbitol may be synthesised via a glucose reduction reaction in which the converted aldehyde group is converted into a hydroxyl group. The reaction requires NADH and is catalyzed by aldose reductase. Glucose reduction is the first step of the polyol pathway of glucose metabolism, and is implicated in multiple diabetic complications. \nThe mechanism involves a tyrosine residue in the active site of aldehyde reductase. The hydrogen atom on NADH is transferred to the electrophilic aldehyde carbon atom; electrons on the aldehyde carbon-oxygen double bond are transferred to the oxygen that abstracts the proton on tyrosine side chain to form the hydroxyl group. The role of aldehyde reductase tyrosine phenol group is to serve as a general acid to provide proton to the reduced aldehyde oxygen on glucose.\nGlucose reduction is not the major glucose metabolism pathway in a normal human body, where the glucose level is in the normal range. However, in diabetic patients whose blood glucose level is high, up to 1/3 of their glucose could go through the glucose reduction pathway. This will consume NADH and eventually leads to cell damage.\nUses.\nSweetener.\nSorbitol is a sugar substitute, and when used in food it has the INS number and E number 420. Sorbitol is about 60% as sweet as sucrose (table sugar).\nSorbitol is referred to as a nutritive sweetener because it provides some dietary energy. It is partly absorbed from the small intestine and metabolized in the body, and partly fermented in the large intestine. The fermentation produces short-chain fatty acids, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, which are mostly absorbed and provide energy, but also carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen which do not provide energy. Even though the heat of combustion of sorbitol is higher than that of glucose (having two extra hydrogen atoms), the net energy contribution is between 2.5 and 3.4 kilocalories per gram, versus the approximately 4 kilocalories (17 kilojoules) for carbohydrates. It is often used in diet foods (including diet drinks and ice cream), mints, cough syrups, and sugar-free chewing gum. Most bacteria cannot use sorbitol for energy, but it can be slowly fermented in the mouth by \"Streptococcus mutans\", a bacterium that causes tooth decay. In contrast, many other sugar alcohols such as isomalt and xylitol are considered non-acidogenic.\nIt also occurs naturally in many stone fruits and berries from trees of the genus \"Sorbus\".\nMedical applications.\nLaxative.\nAs is the case with other sugar alcohols, foods containing sorbitol can cause gastrointestinal distress. Sorbitol can be used as a laxative when taken orally or as an enema. Sorbitol works as a laxative by drawing water into the large intestine, stimulating bowel movements. Sorbitol has been determined safe for use by the elderly, although it is not recommended without the advice of a physician. \nSorbitol is commonly used orally as a one-time dose of 70% solution. It may also be used as a one-time rectal enema.\nOther medical applications.\nSorbitol is used in bacterial culture media to distinguish the pathogenic from most other strains of \"E. coli\", because it is usually unable to ferment sorbitol, unlike 93% of known \"E. coli\" strains.\nA treatment for hyperkalaemia (elevated blood potassium) uses sorbitol and the ion-exchange resin sodium polystyrene sulfonate (tradename Kayexalate). The resin exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions in the bowel, while sorbitol helps to eliminate it. In 2010, the U.S. FDA issued a warning of increased risk for gastrointestinal necrosis with this combination.\nSorbitol is also used in the manufacture of softgel capsules to store single doses of liquid medicines.\nHealth care, food, and cosmetic uses.\nSorbitol often is used in modern cosmetics as a humectant and thickener. It is also used in mouthwash and toothpaste. Some transparent gels can be made only with sorbitol, because of its high refractive index.\nSorbitol is used as a cryoprotectant additive (mixed with sucrose and sodium polyphosphates) in the manufacture of surimi, a processed fish paste. It is also used as a humectant in some cigarettes.\nBeyond its use as a sugar substitute in reduced-sugar foods, sorbitol is also used as a humectant in cookies and low-moisture foods like peanut butter and fruit preserves. In baking, it is also valuable because it acts as a plasticizer, and slows down the staling process.\nMiscellaneous uses.\nA mixture of sorbitol and potassium nitrate has found some success as an amateur solid rocket fuel. It has similar performance to sucrose-based rocket candy, but is easier to cast, less hygroscopic and does not caramelize.\nSorbitol is identified as a potential key chemical intermediate for production of fuels from biomass resources. Carbohydrate fractions in biomass such as cellulose undergo sequential hydrolysis and hydrogenation in the presence of metal catalysts to produce sorbitol. Complete reduction of sorbitol opens the way to alkanes, such as hexane, which can be used as a biofuel. Hydrogen required for this reaction can be produced by aqueous phase catalytic reforming of sorbitol.\n19 C6H14O6 \u2192 13 C6H14 + 36 CO2 + 42 H2O\nThe above chemical reaction is exothermic, and 1.5 moles of sorbitol generate approximately 1 mole of hexane. When hydrogen is co-fed, no carbon dioxide is produced.\nSorbitol based polyols are used in the production of polyurethane foam for the construction industry.\nIt is also added after electroporation of yeasts in transformation protocols, allowing the cells to recover by raising the osmolarity of the medium.\nMedical importance.\nAldose reductase is the first enzyme in the sorbitol-aldose reductase pathway responsible for the reduction of glucose to sorbitol, as well as the reduction of galactose to galactitol. Too much sorbitol trapped in retinal cells, the cells of the lens, and the Schwann cells that myelinate peripheral nerves, is a frequent result of long-term hyperglycemia that accompanies poorly controlled diabetes. This can damage these cells, leading to retinopathy, cataracts and peripheral neuropathy, respectively. \nSorbitol is fermented in the colon and produces short-chain fatty acids, which are beneficial to overall colon health.\nPotential adverse effects.\nSorbitol may cause allergic reactions in some people. Common side effects from use as a laxative are stomach cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, or rectal bleeding.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The discipline is known to have originated when Olav Zipser began experimenting with non-traditional forms of Body flight. Zipser founded the Free Fly Clowns as a two-person competitive team with Mike Vail in 1992. He was joined by Omar Alhegelan (1st ever FAI Freestyle World Cup &amp; World Champion), Charles Bryan, and Stefania Martinengo in 1994. The Free Fly Clowns are also credited with opening the first school to teach free flying, The First School of Modern Skyflying.\nFree flying entered public awareness in 1996 when the SSI Pro Tour added free flying as a three-person competitive discipline at the second televised event (with Skysurfing), part of ESPN's Destination Extreme series. One-hundred and fifty countries watched the Free Fly Clowns (Olav Zipser, Charles Bryan and Omar Alhegelan) as they took 1st place in all four international competitions along with other teams including: the Flyboyz (Eli Thompson, Mike Ortiz, Knut Krecker, Fritz Pfn\u00fcr), Team AirTime (Tony Urugallo, Jim O'Reilly, Peter Raymond, Brian Germain), and many other pioneers of free flying.\nFrom 1996 to 1997, the SSI Pro Tour staged eight televised events in both North America and Europe, with $36,000 in cash prizes awarded to free-fly teams. SSI invited the 1997 Pro World Champions, the Flyboyz, to participate in the 1998 ESPN X Games as an unofficial exhibition.\nThe resulting global television exposure attracted considerable attention to the FreeFly Clowns, the Flyboyz, and Freeflying as a discipline. A once fledgling offshoot of the mainstream, freeflying now comprises one-half of the overall skydiving community.\nZipser's Space Games used a \"space ball\" as a research and measuring device to provide a constant speed and direction from which individual athletes could be trained, judged, and allow individuals to race each other. In 1998, the Space Games accelerated in popularity and brought publicity to the sport Free Flying.\nIn 2000, Free Fly was accepted as an aviation discipline by the International Parachute Commission (IPC) and the first official Free Fly National Championships were held worldwide.\nTechnique.\nFree flying is a form of skydiving that involves a range of body orientations, including both traditional belly-to-earth positions and vertical flight, where the skydiver is either upright (feet-first) or inverted (head-first). These positions allow for unique formations and faster freefall.\nTo master free flying, skydivers must learn various body positions such as the box position (belly-to-earth), back flying, head-up, head-down, and side flying. Skydivers often transition between these positions during a dive, with varying speeds and orientations, either flowing continuously or holding specific positions to form larger formations.\nFree flying carries additional risks due to the increased speed. Skydivers must be cautious to avoid collisions with belly-to-earth divers and must slow their descent before deploying their parachute, as most parachutes are not designed for high-speed openings.\nThough a newer and more extreme discipline, freeflying is growing in popularity in competitions and record-setting events.\nBack flying.\nBack flying is the ability to fly on the back in a stable and controlled fashion. This skill is critical, so that when the flyer flips out of some of the more advanced positions, he or she stays in control and does not endanger themselves or other skydivers.\nSit flying.\nSit flying is called such because it looks similar to the position taken while sitting in a chair.\nFor flying a sit, the feet are oriented toward the relative wind and 90-degree bends are maintained at the knees, hips, and shoulders. To move around, the flyer redirects the airflow in the opposite direction the jumper wants to go. Newtonian mechanics then push the flyer in the desired direction. Fall rate changes (descending faster or slower) can also be made.\nHead down.\nA person falling in the \"head down\" position has less cross-sectional area exposed to the air while falling, which results in much faster fall rates. Average speeds while flying head down are around . Due to the increased speed, every movement made can cause the skydiver to become unstable or disoriented; thus increasing the risk involved in free flying.\nVertical Formation Skydiving.\nVertical formation skydiving (VFS) is a subcategory of formation skydiving using high-speed body positions normally associated with free flying. Competitors build pre-selected formations in free-fall with multiple people gripping each other's limbs or specially built \"grippers\" on their jumpsuits.\nThe F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale (FAI) world record for the largest VFS free-fall formation is a 164-way, set on July 31, 2015 over Chicago, Illinois, United States. https://\nProject Horizon, the Lodi Sequentials, VFS Arizona, and several other yearly invitational skydiving events are centered on pushing the boundaries of VFS.\nCompetition.\nThere is only one category of official VFS competition, that being VFS 4-way, which is part of the United States Parachute Association Skydiving Nationals. The first official VFS 4-Way US Nationals Competition was held on October 27, 2006, in Eloy, Arizona. Nine teams (45 skydivers) competed.\nVFS 4-way has been adopted as an addition to future FAI world competitions (as VFS 4-way), the first being the FAI World Cup in Eloy, AZ, in October 2008.\nRecords.\nThe world's largest vertical (head down) formation took place on Friday, 31 July 2015, when a multinational team of 164 skydivers, some traveling at speeds of over 200\u00a0mph, linked over Skydive Chicago, in Ottawa, Illinois, United States. This broke the previous record of 138 linked skydivers set on Saturday, 4 August 2012 also at Skydive Chicago.\nMarc Hauser set the world record for the fastest horizontal free fall at 304\u00a0km/h in Empuriabrava, Spain without specialized equipment, in October 2012.\nIn 2022, skydivers from twenty-two countries set a new all-female head-down world record with 80 free flyers in formation over Eloy USA. The first attempt at the record jump was scheduled to happen in 2020, the 100th anniversary of women being granted the right to vote, but was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

He initially qualified as an engineer, but he re-trained as a barrister to effectively fight for social causes which deeply concerned him. After a long political career, mostly spent as Attorney-General and briefly as Opposition Leader, he was appointed a Senior Justice of the Supreme Court of Tasmania. Despite being acknowledged as the leading expert on the Australian Constitution, he was never appointed to the High Court of Australia.\nHe popularised the Hare-Clark voting system, and introduced it to Tasmania. In addition Clark was a prolific author, though most of his writings were never published, rather they were circulated privately. Clark was also Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania. Throughout his life, Clark was a progressive. He championed the rights of workers to organise through trades unions, universal suffrage (including women's suffrage) and the rights to a fair trial \u2013 all issues which today we take for granted, but were so radical in the 1880s that he was described as a 'communist' by the \"Hobart Mercury\".\nIn one summation, \"Clark was an Australian Jefferson, who, like the great American Republican, fought for Australian independence; an autonomous judiciary; a wider franchise and lower property qualifications; fairer electoral boundaries; checks and balances between the judicature, legislature and executive; modern, liberal universities; and a Commonwealth that was federal, independent and based on natural rights.\" Less favourably, a contemporary, J.B. Walker, privately judged him an \"eloquent, impressive, dignified ... doctrinaire politician ... wanting in practical ability\".\nYet he also had a rich and warm home life. He is described as \"never too busy to mend a toy for a child, and his wife once wrote on hearing of his imminent return from America: 'to celebrate your return I must do something or \"bust\"'\".\nThe Australian federal Division of Clark is named after him.\nEarly life and marriage.\nClark was born in Hobart, Tasmania, the son of a Scottish engineer, Alexander Clark. He was educated at Hobart High School. After leaving school, he was apprenticed to his family's engineering business, becoming a qualified engineer, and finally its business manager. His father had established a highly successful engineering business, based on an iron foundry. The business was also involved with industrial design and construction of flour mills, water mills, coal mines and other substantial undertaking.\nHe grew to manhood during the 1860s, when the major issue, even in remote Tasmania, was the American Civil War and emancipation. This last issue had an especial resonance in Tasmania where a form of slavery, transportation, had been abolished as recently as 1853. Convicts were still a common sight for years later. As late as 1902, Clark would publicly be moved to tears when discussing slavery. Clark became fascinated by all things American.\nIn 1872, Clark disappointed his father by leaving to study law, becoming an articled clerk with R. P. Adams. He was called to the bar in 1877.\nClark, as a child attended a Baptist Sabbatical School until 1872 when the chapel was dissolved on a motion put by Clark due to the \"lack of discipline and proper order of government in worship.\" He then joined a Unitarian chapel, which led him into contact with leading American Unitarians, including Moncure Conway and Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. The friendship formed with the latter would strongly influence his views and the development of the Clarks' draft of the Australian Constitution.\nEarly in his life, Clark developed a passion for justice and liberty. He joined the \"Minerva Club\" where he participated in debate on contemporary social issues. In 1874, he edited its journal \"Quadrilateral\". As a 'young ardent republican', he was also a member of the \"American Club\", where at the 1876 annual dinner, he declared \"We have met here tonight in the name of the principles which were proclaimed by the founders of the Anglo-American Republic... and we do so because we believe those principles to be permanently applicable to the politics of the world\". He was inspired by Italian Risorgimento, especially by Joseph Mazzini of whom he had a picture in every room. He became a radical, a democrat and a republican.\nIn 1878 he married Grace Paterson (Ross) Clark, the daughter of local shipbuilder John Ross, with whom he had five sons and two daughters:\nOne of the many mysteries of Clark's private life is the circumstances of his marriage. As the son of a prominent family, and a leading figure of his church who was marrying the daughter of a well-known businessman, his marriage might have been expected to be a major social event. Instead, they slipped away to Melbourne, where they were married in the presence of a few friends.\nPolitical career.\nIn 1878, Clark stood for election to the House of Assembly, despite his reputation as an extreme ultra-republican. He was attacked by the Hobart \"Mercury\" for \"holding such very extreme ultra-republican, if not revolutionary, ideas\" that his proper place should be among the 'Communists', and the Launceston \"Examiner\" as a \"stranger from Hobart\". He was elected, unopposed to the electorate of Norfolk Plains. His election was largely due to the influence of Thomas Reibey, a political power broker and a recent Premier.\nClark was the founder of the Southern Tasmania Political Reform Association, whose agenda included manhood suffrage, fixed term parliaments, and electoral reform. While a member of the House of Assembly, Clark was regarded as republican and ultra-progressive. He was one of the few members to legislate as a backbencher and introduce a private members bill. He failed to reform industrial law by amending the Master and Servant Act, but he succeeded with the Criminal Procedure Amendment Act in 1881. He also assisted with reframing the customs tariff.\nIn the 1882 election, Clark was defeated. He failed when he stood for election in 1884 (East Hobart) and 1886 (South Hobart). In 1887, Clark was re-elected, in a by-election as member for East Hobart. In 1888, he was re-elected as member for South Hobart and remained there until the seat was abolished in 1897. He was then the member for Hobart until he resigned upon his appointment to the Supreme Court in 1898.\nIn March 1888, he became Attorney General in the government of Sir Philip Fysh. Since the Premier was in the Legislative Council, Clark was responsible for introducing legislation into the Assembly. Over the next five years he shepherded through the lower house much progressive and humanitarian legislation. His goal was to break the power of property in Tasmanian politics. The legislation covered such diverse reforms as legalising trades unions, providing parliamentary salaries, preventing cruelty to animals, reforming laws on lunacy, trusteeship and companies, the custody of children and the protection of children from neglect and abuse. He also introduced laws to restrict the immigration of Chinese. Clark failed in his attempts to impose a land tax, introduce universal (including female) suffrage and centralise the police.\nClark was the most important 19th-century Attorney-General of Tasmania. His considerable drafting skills enabled him to modernise and simplify the law over a number of areas. He introduced a total of 228 bills into the Assembly. His best known achievement as Attorney-General was the introduction of proportional representation based on the Hare-Clark system of the single transferable vote.\nOne of the major political issues addressed by Clark during his career concerned the Tasmanian Main Line Railway \u2013 a railway which connected Tasmania's two main cities, Hobart and Launceston. In 1873, the Main Line Railway Company began the construction of the line, which opened in 1876. There were a series of disputes between the Company and the government over payments due to the Company under its Deed of Concession. Clark had spoken about the problem, advocating the acquisition of the Company by the government as early as 1878. With his dual qualifications as both an engineer and a lawyer, Clark was in a unique position to understand the issues involved. As Attorney-General, he was the government's chief negotiator.\nIn 1889, the Supreme Court awarded the Company arrears of interest. Clark urged the government to appeal, and in 1890 he went to England to argue the case before the Privy Council. Clark may have been a poor speaker in court, but he was a superb negotiator. It was his \"forte\". With full powers, he settled the case out of court by arranging the purchase of the Company's property by the government.\nIn 1891, Clark returned to Tasmania from London by way of the United States. It was a fateful choice. He was introduced to a fellow Unitarian Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., with whom he corresponded for the rest of his life. The contacts and people he met in Boston were to profoundly inform his views about political constitutions. Not the least of the consequences was the introduction of the term \"commonwealth\" to describe the Australian polity. This term is used in two ways: the Commonwealth Government and the Commonwealth of Australia.\nIn 1892, the fall of the Fysh government ended Clark's term as Attorney-General. When Sir Edward Braddon formed a government in 1894, Clark again became Attorney-General, the same year he was given the title 'Honourable' for life. He resigned in 1897, when his colleagues failed to consult him over the lease of Crown land to private interests, after which he became Leader of the Opposition. Clark left politics to become a Justice of the Supreme Court of Tasmania in 1898.\nClark and Australian Federation.\nClark positioned himself ambiguously with respect to the cause of Australian Federation. Clark was a delegate to the National Australasian Convention of 1891, and was a member of its committee which produced a draft constitution. However, he did not stand for the election of delegates to the Australian Federal Convention of 1897, and embarked on an overseas journey two days after it commenced. Instead of the Convention's proposal to compensate States' for their loss of tariff revenue subsequent to Federation by a guarantee of a share of Commonwealth revenue, he favoured the Commonwealth's assumption of States' debts. Despite the urgings of Federationists, Clark abstained from supporting the Federal cause in the subsequent campaign. A week before the 1898 referendum on Federation, he let it be known \"It is not his intention to advise any elector on how to vote\".\nHare\u2013Clark electoral system.\nIn 1896, after several failed attempts, Clark was able to get a system of proportional representation adopted by the Tasmanian Parliament, but it was to be only on a trial basis for both Hobart (to elect 6 MPs) and Launceston (to elect 4 MPs). The modified single transferable vote method, immediately known as the Hare\u2013Clark system, was renewed annually until suspended in 1902. Clark died in 1907, just as permanent proportional representation struggled through Parliament and over a year before it was used for the first time throughout Tasmania at the general election in April 1909.\nEarly legal career.\nClark was called to the bar in 1877. He soon gained a reputation as a criminal lawyer in a 'poisoning case', but went on to gain a large practice in civil and commercial law as well. He practised law both while in and out of parliament. During those periods when he was not serving as Attorney-General, he worked hard to build a successful practice. He failed to find his fortune in the law due to his generosity and refusal 'to accept anything beyond a reasonable and modest fee'. In 1887 he went into partnership with Matthew Wilkes Simmons.\nHis career in private practice gave him a broad grounding in the law which stood him in good stead once he was promoted to the bench. Clark was knowledgeable in all branches of the law, but pre-eminent as a constitutional lawyer and jurist.\nClark, never in robust health, in fact described as \"small, spare, [and] nervous\" by Alfred Deakin, died at his home 'Rosebank' in Battery Point on 14 November 1907. He is buried in the old Queenborough Cemetery at Sandy Bay.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "56369", "revid": "2136253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56369", "title": "Bell's theorem", "text": "Theorem in physics\nBell's theorem is a term encompassing a number of closely related results in physics, all of which determine that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden-variable theories, given some basic assumptions about the nature of measurement. The first such result was introduced by John Stewart Bell in 1964, building upon the Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen paradox, which had called attention to the phenomenon of quantum entanglement.\nIn the context of Bell's theorem, \"local\" refers to the principle of locality, the idea that a particle can only be influenced by its immediate surroundings, and that interactions mediated by physical fields cannot propagate faster than the speed of light. \"Hidden variables\" are supposed properties of quantum particles that are not included in quantum theory but nevertheless affect the outcome of experiments. In the words of Bell, \"If [a hidden-variable theory] is local it will not agree with quantum mechanics, and if it agrees with quantum mechanics it will not be local.\"\nIn his original paper, Bell deduced that if measurements are performed independently on the two separated particles of an entangled pair, then the assumption that the outcomes depend upon hidden variables within each half implies a mathematical constraint on how the outcomes on the two measurements are correlated. Such a constraint would later be named a Bell inequality. Bell then showed that quantum physics predicts correlations that violate this inequality. Multiple variations on Bell's theorem were put forward in the years following his original paper, using different assumptions and obtaining different Bell (or \"Bell-type\") inequalities.\nThe first rudimentary experiment designed to test Bell's theorem was performed in 1972 by John Clauser and Stuart Freedman. More advanced experiments, known collectively as \"Bell tests\", have been performed many times since. Often, these experiments have had the goal of \"closing loopholes\", that is, ameliorating problems of experimental design or set-up that could in principle affect the validity of the findings of earlier Bell tests. Bell tests have consistently found that physical systems obey quantum mechanics and violate Bell inequalities; which is to say that the results of these experiments are incompatible with local hidden-variable theories. \nThe exact nature of the assumptions required to prove a Bell-type constraint on correlations has been debated by physicists and by philosophers. While the significance of Bell's theorem is not in doubt, different interpretations of quantum mechanics disagree about what exactly it implies.\nTheorem.\nThere are many variations on the basic idea, some employing stronger mathematical assumptions than others. Significantly, Bell-type theorems do not refer to any particular theory of local hidden variables, but instead show that quantum physics violates general assumptions behind classical pictures of nature. The original theorem proved by Bell in 1964 is not the most amenable to experiment, and it is convenient to introduce the genre of Bell-type inequalities with a later example.\nHypothetical characters Alice and Bob stand in widely separated locations. Their colleague Victor prepares a pair of particles and sends one to Alice and the other to Bob. When Alice receives her particle, she chooses to perform one of two possible measurements (perhaps by flipping a coin to decide which). Denote these measurements by formula_1 and formula_2. Both formula_1 and formula_2 are \"binary\" measurements: the result of formula_1 is either formula_6 or formula_7, and likewise for formula_2. When Bob receives his particle, he chooses one of two measurements, formula_9 and formula_10, which are also both binary.\nSuppose that each measurement reveals a property that the particle already possessed. For instance, if Alice chooses to measure formula_1 and obtains the result formula_6, then the particle she received carried a value of formula_6 for a property formula_14. Consider the combinationformula_15Because both formula_14 and formula_17 take the values formula_18, then either formula_19 or formula_20. In the former case, the quantity formula_21 must equal 0, while in the latter case, formula_22. So, one of the terms on the right-hand side of the above expression will vanish, and the other will equal formula_23. Consequently, if the experiment is repeated over many trials, with Victor preparing new pairs of particles, the absolute value of the average of the combination formula_24 across all the trials will be less than or equal to 2. No \"single\" trial can measure this quantity, because Alice and Bob can only choose one measurement each, but on the assumption that the underlying properties exist, the average value of the sum is just the sum of the averages for each term. Using angle brackets to denote averagesformula_25\nThis is a Bell inequality, specifically, the CHSH inequality. Its derivation here depends upon two assumptions: first, that the underlying physical properties formula_26 and formula_27 exist independently of being observed or measured (sometimes called the assumption of \"realism\"); and second, that Alice's choice of action cannot influence Bob's result or vice versa (often called the assumption of \"locality\").\nQuantum mechanics can violate the CHSH inequality, as follows. Victor prepares a pair of qubits which he describes by the Bell stateformula_28\nwhere formula_29 and formula_30 are the eigenstates of one of the Pauli matrices,formula_31\nVictor then passes the first qubit to Alice and the second to Bob. Alice and Bob's choices of possible measurements are also defined in terms of the Pauli matrices. Alice measures either of the two observables formula_32 and formula_33:formula_34\nand Bob measures either of the two observablesformula_35\nVictor can calculate the quantum expectation values for pairs of these observables using the Born rule:formula_36\nWhile only one of these four measurements can be made in a single trial of the experiment, the sumformula_37\ngives the sum of the average values that Victor expects to find across multiple trials. This value exceeds the classical upper bound of 2 that was deduced from the hypothesis of local hidden variables. The value formula_38 is in fact the largest that quantum physics permits for this combination of expectation values, making it a Tsirelson bound.140\nThe CHSH inequality can also be thought of as a \"game\" in which Alice and Bob try to coordinate their actions. Victor prepares two bits, formula_39 and formula_40, independently and at random. He sends bit formula_39 to Alice and bit formula_40 to Bob. Alice and Bob win if they return answer bits formula_43 and formula_44 to Victor, satisfying\nformula_45\nOr, equivalently, Alice and Bob win if the logical AND of formula_39 and formula_40 is the logical XOR of formula_43 and formula_44. Alice and Bob can agree upon any strategy they desire before the game, but they cannot communicate once the game begins. In any theory based on local hidden variables, Alice and Bob's probability of winning is no greater than formula_50, regardless of what strategy they agree upon beforehand. However, if they share an entangled quantum state, their probability of winning can be as large asformula_51\nVariations and related results.\nBell (1964).\nBell's 1964 paper shows that a very simple local hidden-variable model can in restricted circumstances reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics, but then he demonstrates that, in general, such models give different predictions. Bell considers a refinement by David Bohm of the Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen (EPR) thought experiment. In this scenario, a pair of particles are formed together in such a way that they are described by a spin singlet state (which is an example of an entangled state). The particles then move apart in opposite directions. Each particle is measured by a Stern\u2013Gerlach device, a measuring instrument that can be oriented in different directions and that reports one of two possible outcomes, representable by formula_6 and formula_7. The configuration of each measuring instrument is represented by a unit vector, and the quantum-mechanical prediction for the correlation between two detectors with settings formula_54 and formula_55 is\nformula_56\nIn particular, if the orientation of the two detectors is the same (formula_57), then the outcome of one measurement is certain to be the negative of the outcome of the other, giving formula_58. And if the orientations of the two detectors are orthogonal (formula_59), then the outcomes are uncorrelated, and formula_60. Bell proves by example that these special cases \"can\" be explained in terms of hidden variables, then proceeds to show that the full range of possibilities involving intermediate angles \"cannot\".\nBell posited that a local hidden-variable model for these correlations would explain them in terms of an integral over the possible values of some hidden parameter formula_61:formula_62\nwhere formula_63 is a probability density function. The two functions formula_64 and formula_65 provide the responses of the two detectors given the orientation vectors and the hidden variable:formula_66\nCrucially, the outcome of detector formula_67 does not depend upon formula_55, and likewise the outcome of formula_69 does not depend upon formula_54, because the two detectors are physically separated. Now we suppose that the experimenter has a \"choice\" of settings for the second detector: it can be set either to formula_55 or to formula_72. From the assumption that formula_73, that is, perfect anti-correlations are observed for the same setting, Bell proves thatformula_74\nHowever, it is easy to find situations where quantum mechanics violates the Bell inequality while exhibiting perfect anti-correlations. For example, let the vectors formula_54 and formula_55 be orthogonal, and let formula_72 lie in their plane at a 45\u00b0 angle from both of them. Thenformula_78\nwhile\nformula_79\nbut\nformula_80\nTherefore, there is no local hidden-variable model that can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics for all choices of formula_54, formula_55, and formula_83 Experimental results contradict the classical curves and match the curve predicted by quantum mechanics as long as experimental shortcomings are accounted for.\nBell's 1964 theorem requires the possibility of perfect anti-correlations: the ability to make a completely certain prediction about the result from the second detector, knowing the result from the first. The theorem builds upon the \"EPR criterion of reality\", a concept introduced in the 1935 paper by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen. This paper posits: \"If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with probability equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of reality corresponding to that quantity.\" Bell noted that this applies when the two detectors are oriented in the same direction (formula_57), and so the EPR criterion would imply that some element of reality must predetermine the measurement result. Because the quantum description of a particle does not include any such element, the quantum description would have to be incomplete. In other words, Bell's 1964 paper shows that, assuming locality, the EPR criterion implies hidden variables and then he demonstrates that local hidden variables are incompatible with quantum mechanics. Because experiments cannot achieve perfect correlations or anti-correlations in practice, Bell-type inequalities based on derivations that relax this assumption are tested instead.\nGHZ\u2013Mermin (1990).\nDaniel Greenberger, Michael A. Horne, and Anton Zeilinger presented a four-particle thought experiment in 1990, which David Mermin then simplified to use only three particles. In this thought experiment, Victor generates a set of three spin-1/2 particles described by the quantum stateformula_85\nwhere as above, formula_29 and formula_30 are the eigenvectors of the Pauli matrix formula_32. Victor then sends a particle each to Alice, Bob, and Charlie, who wait at widely separated locations. Alice measures either formula_33 or formula_90 on her particle, and so do Bob and Charlie. The result of each measurement is either formula_6 or formula_7. Applying the Born rule to the three-qubit state formula_93, Victor predicts that whenever the three measurements include one formula_33 and two formula_90's, the product of the outcomes will always be formula_6. This follows because formula_93 is an eigenvector of formula_98 with eigenvalue formula_6, and likewise for formula_100 and formula_101. Therefore, knowing Alice's result for a formula_33 measurement and Bob's result for a formula_90 measurement, Victor can predict with probability 1 what result Charlie will return for a formula_90 measurement. According to the EPR criterion of reality, there would be an \"element of reality\" corresponding to the outcome of a formula_90 measurement upon Charlie's qubit. Indeed, this same logic applies to both measurements and all three qubits. Per the EPR criterion of reality, then, each particle contains an \"instruction set\" that determines the outcome of a formula_33 or formula_90 measurement upon it. The set of all three particles would then be described by the instruction setformula_108\nwith each entry being either formula_7 or formula_6, and each formula_33 or formula_90 measurement simply returning the appropriate value.\nIf Alice, Bob, and Charlie all perform the formula_33 measurement, then the product of their results would be formula_114. This value can be deduced fromformula_115\nbecause the square of either formula_7 or formula_6 is formula_118. Each factor in parentheses equals formula_6, soformula_120\nand the product of Alice, Bob, and Charlie's results will be formula_6 with probability unity. But this is inconsistent with quantum physics: Victor can predict using the state formula_93 that the measurement formula_123 will instead yield formula_7 with probability unity.\nThis thought experiment can also be recast as a traditional Bell inequality or, equivalently, as a nonlocal game in the same spirit as the CHSH game. In it, Alice, Bob, and Charlie receive bits formula_125 from Victor, promised to always have an even number of ones, that is, formula_126, and send him back bits formula_127. They win the game if formula_127 have an odd number of ones for all inputs except formula_129, when they need to have an even number of ones. That is, they win the game if and only if formula_130. With local hidden variables the highest probability of victory they can have is 3/4, whereas using the quantum strategy above they win it with certainty. This is an example of quantum pseudo-telepathy.\nKochen\u2013Specker theorem (1967).\nIn quantum theory, orthonormal bases for a Hilbert space represent measurements that can be performed upon a system having that Hilbert space. Each vector in a basis represents a possible outcome of that measurement. Suppose that a hidden variable formula_61 exists, so that knowing the value of formula_61 would imply certainty about the outcome of any measurement. Given a value of formula_61, each measurement outcome \u2013 that is, each vector in the Hilbert space \u2013 is either \"impossible\" or \"guaranteed.\" A Kochen\u2013Specker configuration is a finite set of vectors made of multiple interlocking bases, with the property that a vector in it will always be \"impossible\" when considered as belonging to one basis and \"guaranteed\" when taken as belonging to another. In other words, a Kochen\u2013Specker configuration is an \"uncolorable set\" that demonstrates the inconsistency of assuming a hidden variable formula_61 can be controlling the measurement outcomes.\nFree will theorem.\nThe Kochen\u2013Specker type of argument, using configurations of interlocking bases, can be combined with the idea of measuring entangled pairs that underlies Bell-type inequalities. This was noted beginning in the 1970s by Kochen, Heywood and Redhead, Stairs, and Brown and Svetlichny. As EPR pointed out, obtaining a measurement outcome on one half of an entangled pair implies certainty about the outcome of a corresponding measurement on the other half. The \"EPR criterion of reality\" posits that because the second half of the pair was not disturbed, that certainty must be due to a physical property belonging to it. In other words, by this criterion, a hidden variable formula_61 must exist within the second, as-yet unmeasured half of the pair. No contradiction arises if only one measurement on the first half is considered. However, if the observer has a choice of multiple possible measurements, and the vectors defining those measurements form a Kochen\u2013Specker configuration, then some outcome on the second half will be simultaneously impossible and guaranteed.\nThis type of argument gained attention when an instance of it was advanced by John Conway and Simon Kochen under the name of the free will theorem. The Conway\u2013Kochen theorem uses a pair of entangled qutrits and a Kochen\u2013Specker configuration discovered by Asher Peres.\nQuasiclassical entanglement.\nAs Bell pointed out, some predictions of quantum mechanics can be replicated in local hidden-variable models, including special cases of correlations produced from entanglement. This topic has been studied systematically in the years since Bell's theorem. In 1989, Reinhard Werner introduced what are now called Werner states, joint quantum states for a pair of systems that yield EPR-type correlations but also admit a hidden-variable model. Werner states are bipartite quantum states that are invariant under unitaries of symmetric tensor-product form: formula_136\nIn 2004, Robert Spekkens introduced a toy model that starts with the premise of local, discretized degrees of freedom and then imposes a \"knowledge balance principle\" that restricts how much an observer can know about those degrees of freedom, thereby making them into hidden variables. The allowed states of knowledge (\"epistemic states\") about the underlying variables (\"ontic states\") mimic some features of quantum states. Correlations in the toy model can emulate some aspects of entanglement, like monogamy, but by construction, the toy model can never violate a Bell inequality.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe question of whether quantum mechanics can be \"completed\" by hidden variables dates to the early years of quantum theory. In his 1932 textbook on quantum mechanics, the Hungarian-born polymath John von Neumann presented what he claimed to be a proof that there could be no \"hidden parameters\". The validity and definitiveness of von Neumann's proof were questioned by Hans Reichenbach, in more detail by Grete Hermann, and possibly in conversation though not in print by Albert Einstein. (Simon Kochen and Ernst Specker rejected von Neumann's key assumption as early as 1961, but did not publish a criticism of it until 1967.)\nEinstein argued persistently that quantum mechanics could not be a complete theory. His preferred argument relied on a principle of locality:\nConsider a mechanical system constituted of two partial systems \"A\" and \"B\" which have interaction with each other only during limited time. Let the \u03c8 function before their interaction be given. Then the Schr\u00f6dinger equation will furnish the \u03c8 function after their interaction has taken place. Let us now determine the physical condition of the partial system \"A\" as completely as possible by measurements. Then the quantum mechanics allows us to determine the \u03c8 function of the partial system \"B\" from the measurements made, and from the \u03c8 function of the total system. This determination, however, gives a result which depends upon \"which\" of the determining magnitudes specifying the condition of \"A\" has been measured (for instance coordinates \"or\" momenta). Since there can be only \"one\" physical condition of \"B\" after the interaction and which can reasonably not be considered as dependent on the particular measurement we perform on the system \"A\" separated from \"B\" it may be concluded that the \u03c8 function is not unambiguously coordinated with the physical condition. This coordination of several \u03c8 functions with the same physical condition of system \"B\" shows again that the \u03c8 function cannot be interpreted as a (complete) description of a physical condition of a unit system.\nThe EPR thought experiment is similar, also considering two separated systems \"A\" and \"B\" described by a joint wave function. However, the EPR paper adds the idea later known as the EPR criterion of reality, according to which the ability to predict with probability 1 the outcome of a measurement upon \"B\" implies the existence of an \"element of reality\" within \"B\".\nIn 1951, David Bohm proposed a variant of the EPR thought experiment in which the measurements have discrete ranges of possible outcomes, unlike the position and momentum measurements considered by EPR. The year before, Chien-Shiung Wu and Irving Shaknov had successfully measured polarizations of photons produced in entangled pairs, thereby making the Bohm version of the EPR thought experiment practically feasible.\nBy the late 1940s, the mathematician George Mackey had grown interested in the foundations of quantum physics, and in 1957 he drew up a list of postulates that he took to be a precise definition of quantum mechanics. Mackey conjectured that one of the postulates was redundant, and shortly thereafter, Andrew M. Gleason proved that it was indeed deducible from the other postulates. Gleason's theorem provided an argument that a broad class of hidden-variable theories are incompatible with quantum mechanics. More specifically, Gleason's theorem rules out hidden-variable models that are \"noncontextual\". Any hidden-variable model for quantum mechanics must, in order to avoid the implications of Gleason's theorem, involve hidden variables that are not properties belonging to the measured system alone but also dependent upon the external context in which the measurement is made. This type of dependence is often seen as contrived or undesirable; in some settings, it is inconsistent with special relativity. The Kochen\u2013Specker theorem refines this statement by constructing a specific finite subset of rays on which no such probability measure can be defined.\nTsung-Dao Lee came close to deriving Bell's theorem in 1960. He considered events where two kaons were produced traveling in opposite directions, and came to the conclusion that hidden variables could not explain the correlations that could be obtained in such situations. However, complications arose due to the fact that kaons decay, and he did not go so far as to deduce a Bell-type inequality.\nBell's publications.\nBell chose to publish his theorem in a comparatively obscure journal because it did not require page charges, in fact paying the authors who published there at the time. Because the journal did not provide free reprints of articles for the authors to distribute, however, Bell had to spend the money he received to buy copies that he could send to other physicists. While the articles printed in the journal themselves listed the publication's name simply as \"Physics\", the covers carried the trilingual version \"Physics Physique \u0424\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043a\u0430\" to reflect that it would print articles in English, French and Russian.\nPrior to proving his 1964 result, Bell also proved a result equivalent to the Kochen\u2013Specker theorem (hence the latter is sometimes also known as the Bell\u2013Kochen\u2013Specker or Bell\u2013KS theorem). However, publication of this theorem was inadvertently delayed until 1966. In that paper, Bell argued that because an explanation of quantum phenomena in terms of hidden variables would require nonlocality, the EPR paradox \"is resolved in the way which Einstein would have liked least.\"\nExperiments.\nIn 1967, the unusual title \"Physics Physique \u0424\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043a\u0430\" caught the attention of John Clauser, who then discovered Bell's paper and began to consider how to perform a Bell test in the laboratory. Clauser and Stuart Freedman would go on to perform a Bell test in 1972. This was only a limited test, because the choice of detector settings was made before the photons had left the source. In 1982, Alain Aspect and collaborators performed the first Bell test to remove this limitation. This began a trend of progressively more stringent Bell tests. The GHZ thought experiment was implemented in practice, using entangled triplets of photons, in 2000. By 2002, testing the CHSH inequality was feasible in undergraduate laboratory courses.\nIn Bell tests, there may be problems of experimental design or set-up that affect the validity of the experimental findings. These problems are often referred to as \"loopholes\". The purpose of the experiment is to test whether nature can be described by local hidden-variable theory, which would contradict the predictions of quantum mechanics.\nThe most prevalent loopholes in real experiments are the \"detection\" and \"locality\" loopholes. The detection loophole is opened when a small fraction of the particles (usually photons) are detected in the experiment, making it possible to explain the data with local hidden variables by assuming that the detected particles are an unrepresentative sample. The locality loophole is opened when the detections are not done with a spacelike separation, making it possible for the result of one measurement to influence the other without contradicting relativity. In some experiments there may be additional defects that make local-hidden-variable explanations of Bell test violations possible.\nAlthough both the locality and detection loopholes had been closed in different experiments, a long-standing challenge was to close both simultaneously in the same experiment. This was finally achieved in three experiments in 2015.\nRegarding these results, Alain Aspect writes that \"no experiment ... can be said to be totally loophole-free,\" but he says the experiments \"remove the last doubts that we should renounce\" local hidden variables, and refers to examples of remaining loopholes as being \"far fetched\" and \"foreign to the usual way of reasoning in physics.\"\nThese efforts to experimentally validate violations of the Bell inequalities would later result in Clauser, Aspect, and Anton Zeilinger being awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics.\nInterpretations.\nReactions to Bell's theorem have been many and varied. Maximilian Schlosshauer, Johannes Kofler, and Zeilinger write that Bell inequalities provide \"a wonderful example of how we can have a rigorous theoretical result tested by numerous experiments, and yet disagree about the implications.\"\nThe Copenhagen interpretation.\nCopenhagen-type interpretations generally take the violation of Bell inequalities as grounds to reject the assumption often called counterfactual definiteness or \"realism\", which is not necessarily the same as abandoning realism in a broader philosophical sense. For example, Roland Omn\u00e8s argues for the rejection of hidden variables and concludes that \"quantum mechanics is probably as realistic as any theory of its scope and maturity ever will be\". Likewise, Rudolf Peierls took the message of Bell's theorem to be that, because the premise of locality is physically reasonable, \"hidden variables cannot be introduced without abandoning some of the results of quantum mechanics\".\nThis is also the route taken by interpretations that descend from the Copenhagen tradition, such as consistent histories (often advertised as \"Copenhagen done right\"), as well as QBism.\nMany-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\nThe many-worlds interpretation, also known as the Everett interpretation, is dynamically local, meaning that it does not call for action at a distance, and deterministic, because it consists of the unitary part of quantum mechanics without collapse. It can generate correlations that violate a Bell inequality because it violates an implicit assumption by Bell that measurements have a single outcome. In fact, Bell's theorem can be proven in the Many-Worlds framework from the assumption that a measurement has a single outcome. Therefore, a violation of a Bell inequality can be interpreted as a demonstration that measurements have multiple outcomes.\nThe explanation it provides for the Bell correlations is that when Alice and Bob make their measurements, they split into local branches. From the point of view of each copy of Alice, there are multiple copies of Bob experiencing different results, so Bob cannot have a definite result, and the same is true from the point of view of each copy of Bob. They will obtain a mutually well-defined result only when their future light cones overlap. At this point we can say that the Bell correlation starts existing, but it was produced by a purely local mechanism. Therefore, the violation of a Bell inequality cannot be interpreted as a proof of non-locality.\nNon-local hidden variables.\nMost advocates of the hidden-variables idea believe that experiments have ruled out local hidden variables. They are ready to give up locality, explaining the violation of Bell's inequality by means of a non-local hidden variable theory, in which the particles exchange information about their states. This is the basis of the Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, which requires that all particles in the universe be able to instantaneously exchange information with all others. One challenge for non-local hidden variable theories is to explain why this instantaneous communication can exist at the level of the hidden variables, but it cannot be used to send signals. A 2007 experiment ruled out a large class of non-Bohmian non-local hidden variable theories, though not Bohmian mechanics itself.\nThe transactional interpretation, which postulates waves traveling both backwards and forwards in time, is likewise non-local.\nSuperdeterminism.\nA necessary assumption to derive Bell's theorem is that the hidden variables are not correlated with the measurement settings. This assumption has been justified on the grounds that the experimenter has \"free will\" to choose the settings, and that it is necessary to do science in the first place. A (hypothetical) theory where the choice of measurement is necessarily correlated with the system being measured is known as \"superdeterministic\".\nA few advocates of deterministic models have not given up on local hidden variables. For example, Gerard 't Hooft has argued that superdeterminism cannot be dismissed.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nThe following are intended for general audiences.\nThe following are more technically oriented.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "56371", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56371", "title": "Mass (liturgy)", "text": "Type of worship service within many Christian denominations\nMass is the main Eucharistic liturgical service in many forms of Western Christianity. The term \"Mass\" is commonly used in the Catholic Church, Western Rite Orthodoxy, Old Catholicism, and Independent Catholicism. The term is also used in many Lutheran churches, as well as in some Anglican churches, and on rare occasion by other Protestant churches. \nOther Christian denominations may employ terms such as \"Divine Service\" or \"worship service\" (and often just \"service\"), rather than the word \"Mass\". For the celebration of the Eucharist in Eastern Christianity, including Eastern Catholic Churches, other terms such as \"Divine Liturgy\", \"Holy Qurbana\", \"Holy Qurobo\" and \"Badarak\" (or \"Patarag\") are typically used instead.\nEtymology.\nThe English noun \"Mass\" is derived from the Middle Latin . The Latin word was adopted in Old English as (via a Vulgar Latin form ), and was sometimes glossed as \"sendnes\" (i.e. 'a sending, dismission').\nThe Latin term itself was in use by the 6th century. It is most likely derived from the concluding formula (\"Go; the dismissal is made\"); here is a Late Latin substantive corresponding to classical .\nHistorically, however, there have been other etymological explanations of the noun that claim not to derive from the formula . Fortescue (1910) cites older, \"fanciful\" etymological explanations, notably a latinization of Hebrew () \"unleavened bread; oblation\", a derivation favoured in the 16th century by Reuchlin and Luther, or Greek \"initiation\", or even Germanic \"assembly\". The French historian Du Cange in 1678 reported \"various opinions on the origin\" of the noun \"Mass\", including the derivation from Hebrew (), here attributed to Caesar Baronius. The Hebrew derivation is learned speculation from 16th-century philology; medieval authorities did derive the noun from the verb , but not in connection with the formula . Thus, (9th century) explains the word as (\"from 'sending', because it sends us towards God\"), while Rupert of Deutz (early 12th century) derives it from a \"dismissal\" of the \"enmities which had been between God and men\" ().\nOrder of the Mass.\nA distinction is made between texts that recur for every Mass celebration (, ordinary), and texts that are sung depending on the occasion (, proper).\nCatholic Church.\nThe Catholic Church sees the Mass or Eucharist as \"the source and summit of the Christian life\", to which the other sacraments are oriented. Remembered in the Mass are Jesus' life, Last Supper, and sacrificial death on the cross at Calvary. The ordained celebrant (priest or bishop) is understood to act \"in persona Christi\", as he recalls the words and gestures of Jesus Christ at the Last Supper and leads the congregation in praise of God. The Mass is composed of two parts, the Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of the Eucharist.\nJesuit priest , writing in 1965, noted that \"The eucharistic liturgy of the state Church of Sweden, which is Lutheran, is closer in many respects to the rite of the Roman Mass than that of any other Protestant church.\" Although similar in outward appearance to the Lutheran Mass or Anglican Mass, the Catholic Church distinguishes between its own Mass and theirs on the basis of what it views as the validity of the orders of their clergy, and as a result, does not ordinarily permit intercommunion between members of these Churches. In a 1993 letter to Bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria, Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) affirmed that \"a theology oriented to the concept of succession [of bishops], such as that which holds in the Catholic and in the Orthodox church, need not in any way deny the salvation-granting presence of the Lord [\"Heilschaffende Gegenwart des Herrn\"] in a Lutheran [\"evangelische\"] Lord's Supper\". The Decree on Ecumenism, produced by Vatican II in 1964, records that the Catholic Church notes its understanding that when other faith groups (such as Lutherans, Anglicans, and Presbyterians) \"commemorate His death and resurrection in the Lord's Supper, they profess that it signifies life in communion with Christ and look forward to His coming in glory\".\nWithin the fixed structure outlined below, which is specific to the Roman Rite, the Scripture readings, the antiphons sung or recited during the entrance procession or at Communion, and certain other prayers vary each day according to the liturgical calendar.\nTraditionalist Roman Catholics use the term salvific \"Sacrifice (\"prosphora\", \"oblatio\") of the Mass\".\nIntroductory rites.\nThe priest enters, with a deacon if there is one, and altar servers (who may act as crucifer, candle-bearers and thurifer). The priest makes the sign of the cross with the people and formally greets them. Of the options offered for the Introductory Rites, that preferred by liturgists would bridge the praise of the opening hymn with the Glory to God which follows. The \"Kyrie eleison\" here has from early times been an acclamation of God's mercy. The Penitential Act instituted by the Council of Trent is also still permitted here, with the caution that it should not turn the congregation in upon itself during these rites which are aimed at uniting those gathered as one praiseful congregation. The Introductory Rites are brought to a close by the Collect Prayer.\nLiturgy of the Word.\nOn Sundays and solemnities, three Scripture readings are given. On other days there are only two. If there are three readings, the first is from the Old Testament (a term wider than \"Hebrew Scriptures\", since it includes the Deuterocanonical Books), or the Acts of the Apostles during Eastertide. The first reading is followed by a psalm, recited or sung responsorially. The second reading is from the New Testament epistles, typically from one of the Pauline epistles. A Gospel acclamation is then sung as the Book of the Gospels is processed, sometimes with incense and candles, to the ambo; if not sung it may be omitted. The final reading and high point of the Liturgy of the Word is the proclamation of the Gospel by the deacon or priest. On all Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation, and preferably at all Masses, a homily or sermon that draws upon some aspect of the readings or the liturgy itself, is then given. The homily is preferably moral and hortatory. Finally, the Nicene Creed or, especially from Easter to Pentecost, the Apostles' Creed is professed on Sundays and solemnities, and the Universal Prayer or Prayer of the Faithful follows. The designation \"of the faithful\" comes from when catechumens did not remain for this prayer or for what follows.\nLiturgy of the Eucharist.\nThe Liturgy of the Eucharist begins with the preparation of the altar and gifts, while the collection may be taken. This concludes with the priest saying: \"Pray, brethren, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.\" The congregation stands and responds: \"May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands, for the praise and glory of His name, for our good, and the good of all His holy Church.\" The priest then pronounces the variable prayer over the gifts.\nThen in dialogue with the faithful the priest brings to mind the meaning of \"eucharist\", to give thanks to God. A variable prayer of thanksgiving follows, concluding with the acclamation \"Holy, Holy ...Heaven and earth are full of your glory. ...Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.\"\nThe anaphora, or more properly \"Eucharistic Prayer\", follows. The oldest of the anaphoras of the Roman Rite, fixed since the Council of Trent, is called the Roman Canon, with central elements dating to the fourth century. With the liturgical renewal following the Second Vatican Council, numerous other Eucharistic prayers have been composed, including four for children's Masses. Central to the Eucharist is the Institution Narrative, recalling the words and actions of Jesus at his Last Supper, which he told his disciples to do in remembrance of him. Then the congregation acclaims its belief in Christ's conquest over death, and their hope of eternal life. Since the early church an essential part of the Eucharistic prayer has been the epiclesis, the calling down of the Holy Spirit to sanctify the offering and that \"the unblemished sacrificial victim to be consumed in Communion may be for the salvation of those who will partake of it.\" The priest concludes with a doxology in praise of God's work, at which the people give their Amen to the whole Eucharistic prayer.\nCommunion rite.\nAll together recite or sing the \"Lord's Prayer\" (\"Pater Noster\" or \"Our Father\"). The priest introduces it with a short phrase and follows it up with a prayer called the embolism, after which the people respond with another doxology. The sign of peace is exchanged and then the \"Lamb of God\" (\"Agnus Dei\" in Latin) litany is sung or recited while the priest breaks the host and places a piece in the main chalice; this is known as the rite of fraction and commingling.\nThe priest then displays the consecrated elements to the congregation, saying: \"Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb,\" to which all respond: \"Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\" Then Communion is given, often with lay ministers assisting with the consecrated wine. According to Catholic teaching, one should be in the state of grace, without mortal sin, to receive Communion. Singing by all the faithful during the Communion procession is encouraged \"to express the communicants' union in spirit\" from the bread that makes them one. A silent time for reflection follows, and then the variable concluding prayer of the Mass.\nConcluding rite.\nThe priest imparts a blessing over those present. The deacon or, in his absence, the priest himself then dismisses the people, choosing a formula by which the people are \"sent forth\" to spread the good news. The congregation responds: \"Thanks be to God.\" A recessional hymn is sung by all, as the ministers process to the rear of the church.\nWestern Rite Orthodox Churches.\nSince most Eastern Orthodox Christians use the Byzantine Rite, most Eastern Orthodox Churches call their Eucharistic service \"the Divine Liturgy.\" However, there are a number of parishes within the Eastern Orthodox Church which use an edited version of Latin liturgical rites. Most parishes use the \"Divine Liturgy of St. Tikhon\" which is a revision of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, or \"the Divine Liturgy of St. Gregory\" which is derived from the Tridentine form of the Roman Rite Mass. These rubrics have been revised to reflect the doctrine and dogmas of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Therefore, the filioque clause has been removed, a fuller epiclesis has been added, and the use of leavened bread has been introduced.\nDivine Liturgy of St. Gregory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLutheranism.\nIn the Book of Concord, Article XXIV (\"Of the Mass\") of the Augsburg Confession (1530) begins thus: ...the Mass is retained among us, and celebrated with the highest reverence. We do not abolish the Mass but religiously keep and defend it. [...] We keep the traditional liturgical form. [...] In our churches Mass is celebrated every Sunday and on other holy days, when the sacrament is offered to those who wish for it after they have been examined and absolved (Article XXIV).\nLutheran churches often celebrate the Eucharist each Sunday (Lord's Day) in the Mass. This aligns with the Lutheran Confessions, as with the views promulgated by Martin Luther. Eucharistic Ministers take the sacramental elements to the sick in hospitals and nursing homes, as well as prisons. The practice of weekly Communion is the norm in most Lutheran parishes throughout the world. The bishops and priests (pastors) of the larger Lutheran bodies have strongly encouraged the practice of weekly Mass, and daily Mass is offered in some Lutheran churches, as well as at Lutheran convents and monasteries, such as \u00d6stanb\u00e4ck Monastery and Saint Augustine's House. \nTraditionally, in the Lutheran Churches, the Mass is celebrated \"ad orientem\", being \"oriented to the East from which the Sun of Righteousness will return\". Though some parishes now celebrate the Mass \"versus populum\", the traditional liturgical posture of \"ad orientem\" is retained by many Lutheran churches.\nOrder of the Mass.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLutherans affirm that the Sacrifice of the Mass (\"sacrificium eucharistikon\") is a sacrifice of thanksgiving and praise (\"sacrificia laudis\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMartin Luther rejected parts of the Roman Rite Mass, specifically the Roman Catholic Canon of the Mass, which, as he argued, did not conform with . That verse contrasts the Old Testament priests, who needed to make a propitiatory sacrifice for sins on a regular basis, with the single priest Christ, who offers his body only once as a sacrifice. The theme is carried out also in , , and . Luther composed as a replacement a revised Latin-language rite, \"Formula Missae,\" in 1523, and the vernacular Deutsche Messe in 1526. The \"Formula Missae\" supplanted the Canon of the Mass with the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n(i) \"Sursum Corda\" and preface, to 'through Christ our Lord'.\n(ii) The Words of Institution, intoned.\n(iii) The \"Sanctus\" and \"Benedictus\" with the elevation of the bread and the cup.\nThe Apology of the Augsburg Confession affirmed the Greek Canon, and the Pfalz-Neuburg Church Order (1543), modeled by the Lutheran divine Philip Melanchthon includes the following Eucharistic Prayer prior to the Words of Institution:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Lord Jesus Christ, thou only true Son of the living God, who hast given thy body unto bitter death for us all, and hast shed thy blood for the forgiveness of our sins, and hast bidden all thy disciples to eat that same thy body and to drink thy blood whereby to remember thy death ; we bring before thy divine Majesty these thy gifts of bread and wine and beseech thee to hallow and bless the same by thy divine grace, goodness and power and ordain [\"schaffen\"] that this bread and wine may be [\"sei\"] thy body and blood, even unto eternal life to all who eat and drink thereof.\nThe Order of the Mass produced under the liturgical reforms of the Lutheran divine Olavus Petri, expanded the anaphora from the \"Formula Missae\", which liturgical scholar Frank Senn states fostered \"a church life that was both catholic and evangelical, embracing the whole population of the country and maintaining continuity with pre-Reformation traditions, but centered in the Bible's gospel.\"\nScandinavian, Finnish, and some English-speaking Lutherans, use the term \"Mass\" for their Eucharistic service, though in most German- and English-speaking churches, the terms \"Divine Service\", \"Holy Communion, or \"the Holy Eucharist\" are used more frequently, though the term \"Mass\" enjoys usage as well.\nAnglicanism.\nIn the Anglican tradition, \"Mass\" is one of many terms for the Eucharist. More frequently, the term used is either \"Holy Communion\", \"Holy Eucharist\", or the \"Lord's Supper\". Occasionally the term used in Eastern churches, the \"Divine Liturgy\", is also used. In the English-speaking Anglican world, the term used often identifies the Eucharistic theology of the person using it. \"Mass\" is frequently used by Anglo-Catholics.\nStructure of the rite.\nThe various Eucharistic liturgies used by national churches of the Anglican Communion have continuously evolved from the 1549 and 1552 editions of the \"Book of Common Prayer\", both of which owed their form and contents chiefly to the work of Thomas Cranmer, who in about 1547 had rejected the medieval theology of the Mass. Although the 1549 rite retained the traditional sequence of the Mass, its underlying theology was Cranmer's and the four-day debate in the House of Lords during December 1548 makes it clear that this had already moved far beyond traditional Catholicism. In the 1552 revision, this was made clear by the restructuring of the elements of the rite while retaining nearly all the language so that it became, in the words of an Anglo-Catholic liturgical historian (Arthur Couratin) \"a series of communion devotions; disembarrassed of the Mass with which they were temporarily associated in 1548 and 1549\". Some rites, such as the 1637 Scottish rite and the 1789 rite in the United States, went back to the 1549 model. From the time of the Elizabethan Settlement in 1559 the services allowed for a certain variety of theological interpretation. Today's rites generally follow the same general five-part shape. Some or all of the following elements may be altered, transposed or absent depending on the rite, the liturgical season and use of the province or national church:\nThe liturgy is divided into two main parts: The Liturgy of the Word (Gathering, Proclaiming and Hearing the Word, Prayers of the People) and the Liturgy of the Eucharist (together with the Dismissal), but the entire liturgy itself is also properly referred to as the Holy Eucharist. The sequence of the liturgy is almost identical to the Roman Rite, except the Confession of Sin ends the Liturgy of the Word in the Anglican rites in North America, while in the Roman Rite (when used) and in Anglican rites in many jurisdictions the Confession is near the beginning of the service.\nSpecial Masses.\nThe Anglican tradition includes separate rites for nuptial, funeral, and votive Masses. The Eucharist is an integral part of many other sacramental services, including ordination and Confirmation.\nCeremonial.\nSome Anglo-Catholic parishes use Anglican versions of the Tridentine Missal, such as the \"English Missal\", \"The Anglican Missal\", or the \"American Missal\", for the celebration of Mass, all of which are intended primarily for the celebration of the Eucharist, or use the order for the Eucharist in \"Common Worship\" arranged according to the traditional structure, and often with interpolations from the Roman Rite. In the Episcopal Church (United States), a traditional-language, Anglo-Catholic adaptation of the 1979 \"Book of Common Prayer\" has been published (\"An Anglican Service Book\").\nAll of these books contain such features as meditations for the presiding celebrant(s) during the liturgy, and other material such as the rite for the blessing of palms on Palm Sunday, propers for special feast days, and instructions for proper ceremonial order. These books are used as a more expansively Catholic context in which to celebrate the liturgical use found in the Book of Common Prayer and related liturgical books. In England supplementary liturgical texts for the proper celebration of Festivals, Feast days and the seasons is provided in \"Common Worship; Times and Seasons\" (2013), ' (2008) and ' (2011).\nThese are often supplemented in Anglo-Catholic parishes by books specifying ceremonial actions, such as \"A Priest's Handbook\" by Dennis G. Michno, \"Ceremonies of the Eucharist\" by Howard E. Galley, \"\" by C. P. A. Burnett, \"Ritual Notes\" by E.C.R. Lamburn, and \"The Parson's Handbook\" (Percy Dearmer). In Evangelical Anglican parishes, the rubrics detailed in the \"Book of Common Prayer\" are considered normative.\nMethodism.\nThe celebration of the \"Mass\" in Methodist churches, commonly known as the Service of the Table, is based on \"The Sunday Service\" of 1784, a revision of the liturgy of the 1662 \"Book of Common Prayer\" authorized by John Wesley. The use of the term \"Mass\" is very rare in Methodism. The terms \"Holy Communion\", \"Lord's Supper\", and to a lesser extent \"Eucharist\" are far more typical.\nThe celebrant of a Methodist Eucharist must be an ordained or licensed minister. In the Free Methodist Church, the liturgy of the Eucharist, as provided in its \"Book of Discipline,\" is outlined as follows:\nMethodist services of worship, post-1992, reflect the ecumenical movement and Liturgical Movement, particularly the \"Methodist Mass\", largely the work of theologian Donald C. Lacy.\nCalendrical usage.\nThe English suffix \"-mas\" (equivalent to modern English \"Mass\") can label certain prominent (originally religious) feasts or seasons based on a traditional liturgical year.

{"id": "56375", "revid": "514304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56375", "title": "Aniara", "text": "1956 poem by Harry Martinson\nAniara () is a book-length epic science fiction poem written by Swedish Nobel laureate Harry Martinson from 1953 to 1956. It narrates the tragedy of a large passenger spacecraft carrying a cargo of colonists escaping destruction on Earth veering off course, leaving the Solar System and entering into an existential struggle. The style is symbolic, sweeping and innovative for its time, with creative use of neologisms to suggest the science fictional setting. It was published in its final form on 13October 1956.\n\"Aniara\" has been translated to around twenty languages. There are numerous adaptations include an opera in 1959 and a Swedish feature film in 2018.\nAniara, published in October 1956, was met with public interest and enthusiasm from literary critics and readers. The work was praised for its lyrical storytelling, profound thought, and its portrayal of human greatness turning into humiliation and powerlessness. Aniara has influenced other works of science fiction, such as \"Tau Zero\" (1970) by Poul Anderson and \"A Fire Upon the Deep\" (1992) by Vernor Vinge. The poem has become a landmark literary work and is often used as the basis for planetarium shows in Sweden. In 2019, the extrasolar planet HD 102956 b was named after Isagel, a character from the story, and its star was named Aniara.\nTitle.\nIn a 1997 Swedish edition of \"Aniara,\" literary scholar Johan Wrede writes that the neologism \u201cAniara\u201d is Harry Martinson's own invention. Martinson came up with the word years before writing the work while reading astronomer Arthur Eddington, then giving it the meaning as the \"name for the space in which the atoms move\". Others have submitted additional theories as to the origin of the word. A preface to a 2005 Italian edition claims that the title comes from ancient Greek \u1f00\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2, \"sad, despairing\", plus special resonances that the sound \"a\" had for Martinson. Another theory of unclear origin makes up the word \"Aniara\" from the chemical symbols Ni (Nickel) and Ar (Argon) and the negative prefix \"a-\", and interprets this as the ship being untethered to both earth (Nickel being abundant in the Earth's core) and sky (Argon being abundant in the Earth's atmosphere). Martinson himself is said (by Tord Hall, longtime friend) to have been fond of this interpretation.\nInterpretation.\nAccording to Ott and Broman, \"Aniara\" is an effort to \"[mediate] between science and poetry, between the wish to understand and the difficulty to comprehend\". Martinson translates scientific imagery into the poem: for example, the \"curved space\" from Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity is likely an inspiration for Martinson's description of the cosmos as \"a bowl of glass\", according to the Nobel Prize Foundation. Martinson also said he was influenced by Paul Dirac.\nThe poem.\nThe poem consists of 103 cantos, each relating the tragedy of a large passenger spacecraft originally bound for Mars with a cargo of colonists from the ravaged Earth. After an accident, the ship is ejected from the Solar System and into an existential struggle.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nWe listen daily to the sonic coins\nprovided every one of us and played\nthrough the Finger-singer worn on the left hand.\nWe trade coins of diverse denominations:\nand all of them play all that they contain\nand though a dyma 1 scarcely weighs one grain\nit plays out like a cricket on each hand\nblanching here in this distraction-land.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe first 29 cantos of \"Aniara\" had previously been published in Martinson's collection \"Cikada\" (1953), under the title \"S\u00e5ngen om Doris och Mima\" (\"The Song of Doris and Mima\"), relating the departure from Earth, the accidental near-collision with an asteroid (incidentally named Hondo, another name for the main Japanese isle where Hiroshima is situated) and ejection from the solar system, the first few years of increasing despair and distractions of the passengers, until news is received of the destruction of their home port, and perhaps of Earth itself. According to Martinson, he dictated the initial cycle as in a fever after a troubling dream, affected by the Cold War and the Soviet suppression of the 1956 Hungarian revolution; in another recounting, he said the first 29 cantos were said to be inspired by his observation of the Andromeda Galaxy.\nA major theme is that of art, symbolised by the semi-mystical machinery of the \"Mima\", who relieves the ennui of crew and passengers with scenes of far-off times and places, and whose operator is also the sometimes na\u00efve main narrator. The rooms of Mima, according to Martinson, represent different kinds of life styles or forms of consciousness. The accumulated destruction the Mima witnesses impels her to destroy herself in despair, to which she, the machine, is finally moved by the \"white tears of the granite\" melted by the \"phototurb\" which annihilates their home port, the great city of Dorisburg. Without the succour of the Mima, the erstwhile colonists seek distraction in sensual orgies, memories of their own and earlier lives, low comedy, religious cults, observations of strange astronomical phenomena, empty entertainments, science, routine tasks, brutal totalitarianism, and in all kinds of human endeavour, but ultimately cannot face the emptiness outside and inside.\nThe poems are metrical and mostly rhymed, using both traditional and individual forms, several alluding to a wide range of Swedish and Nordic poetry, such as the Finnish Kalevala.\nTranslations.\n\"Aniara\" has been translated to around twenty languages including French, German, Italian, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Czech, Russian, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, English, and Esperanto.\nEnglish translations.\n\"Aniara\" was translated into English as \"Aniara, A Review of Man in Time and Space\" by Hugh MacDiarmid and E. Harley Schubert in 1963. It was translated again into English by Stephen Klass and Leif Sj\u00f6berg for a 1999 edition. Neither edition is currently[ [update]] in print.\nGeoffrey O'Brien, writing for the New York Review of Books, compares the two editions and finds the recent Klass Sj\u00f6berg edition more faithful to \"Martinson's formal schemes\" while considering the MacDiarmid Schubert edition \"more persuasive\" as English poetry. Burns Singer wrote of the original translation \"it may well prove a seminal volume in the history of English letters\" in Times Literary Supplement.\nReception.\nThe publication of \"Aniara\" in October 1956 was met with much public interest and was enthusiastically received by many Swedish literary critics and readers. Reviewing it in Expressen in 1956, Bo Str\u00f6mstedt wrote: \"it is a fabulous story, and Harry Martinson tells it with an ingenuity \u2013 in substance and in words \u2013 that is also quite fabulous; even though most of the songs are written in the same iambic verse, the book never becomes monotonous.\" \"Harry Martinson has not only written a breathtakingly lyrical science fiction story; he has also (...) created a gigantic \"Paradise lost\", an epic about how human greatness is turned into humiliation and powerlessness\".\nThe well-known American science fiction writer, Theodore Sturgeon, in reviewing a 1964 American edition for a genre audience, stated that \"Martinson's achievement here is an inexpressible, immeasurable sadness. [It] [t]ranscends panic and terror and even despair [and] leaves you in the quiet immensities, with the feeling that you have spent time, and have been permanently tinted, by and with an impersonal larger-than-God force.\"\nWriting a guest review for The New York Times, D. Bruce Lockerbie suggested that with \"Aniara\" Martinson had, along with C. S. Lewis, \"found that an interplanetary setting, light years removed from mundanity\" supplied \"the esthetic distance necessary for truly profound thought.\"\nThe poem has also been reviewed more recently. In a 2015 review, James Nicoll writes \"Martinson\u2019s creative approach to astronomy and related matters gives the work an misleadingly archaic feel.\" M. A. Orthofer finds in 2018, the poem \"a product of its times, but even as aspects may no longer seem as current, it holds up well in its bleak vision.\" In his 2019 overview of Martinson's works in the New York Review of Books, Geoffrey O'Brien concludes \"Aniara is an epic of extinction, conceived at a moment when extinction had begun to seem not only possible but perhaps imminent.\"\nLegacy.\n\"Aniara\" has had an influence on later works of science fiction, such as \"Tau Zero\" by Danish-American writer Poul Anderson.\nIn the 2004 centennial celebration of the birth of Harry Martinson, the Martinson Society characterized \"Aniara\" as an \"epic poem about the spaceship in which we flee the destruction of the earth, the spaceship that drifts off course into an endless universe\", and considered the poem to have achieved becoming a legend in their own right, one of the myths people are familiar with without necessarily knowing who created them.\nIn December 2019, the extrasolar planet HD 102956 b was named after a character aboard the spacecraft, the pilot \"Isagel\", as part of the IAU NameExoWorlds project. The exoplanet's star was named \"Aniara\".\nAdaptations.\nAn opera by Karl-Birger Blomdahl also called \"Aniara\" premiered in 1959 with a libretto by Erik Lindegren based on Martinson's poem; it was staged in Stockholm, Hamburg, Brussels and Darmstadt, and later in Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6. A performance by the Royal Swedish Opera at the Edinburgh International Festival was broadcast on the BBC Third Programme in Sept 1959.\nAniara (1960), a Swedish TV film directed by Arne Arnbom, written by Erik Lindegren and Harry Martinson, and starring Margareta Hallin, Elisabeth S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m, Erik S\u00e6d\u00e9n and Arne Tyr\u00e9n. The music was composed by Karl-Birger Blomdahl.\nThe BBC Third Programme broadcast an English translation, read over five nights, in November 1962.\nIn Martinsons home country of Sweden, \"Aniara\" has commonly been used as the basis of planetarium shows, the first one set up in 1988 by Bj\u00f6rn Stenholm using music by Dmitrij Shostakovich in the planetarium then housed in what is now the Old Observatory in Lund, Sweden. An English-language show premiered during the International Planetarium Society conference in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1992.\nTommy K\u00f6rberg headlined \"31 songs from Aniara\", a stage concert first set up in Olofstr\u00f6m, Sweden in 1997.\nThe fourth album from the Swedish progressive metal band Seventh Wonder called \"The Great Escape\" (2010) is based on \"Aniara,\" the title track last 30:21 minutes and relates all the poem from beginning to end.\nSwedish musician Kleerup released an album based on \"Aniara\" in 2012.\nA melding of \"Aniara\" and Beethoven's opera \"Fidelio\" was staged by the Op\u00e9ra de Lyon under the direction of American artist Gary Hill in 2013.\n\"Aniara\", a 2018 Swedish feature film by directors Pella K\u00e5german and Hugo Lilja, starring Emelie Jonsson, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival that year. Also in 2018, artist Fia Backstrom made the installation \" A Vaudeville on Mankind in Time and Space\", using \"Aniara\" as its point of origin.\n\"Aniara: Fragments of Time and Space\", a choral theatre work with The Crossing, Helsinki\u2019s Klockriketeatern, and composer Robert Maggio was performed in 2019.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Johnson (\"Thunder Thumbs\"). They achieved their greatest success from the mid-1970s to early 1980s, with three singles topping the R&amp;B charts (\"I'll Be Good to You\", \"Strawberry Letter 23\", and \"Stomp!\").\nBackground.\nFormation.\nGuitarist/vocalist George and bassist/vocalist Louis formed the band Johnson Three Plus One with older brother Tommy and their cousin Alex Weir while attending school in Los Angeles, California. When they became professionals, the band backed such touring R&amp;B acts as Bobby Womack and the Supremes. George and Louis Johnson later joined Billy Preston's band and wrote selections for his albums \"Music Is My Life\" and \"The Kids &amp; Me\" before leaving his group in 1973. In 1976, the Brothers covered the Beatles' song, \"Hey Jude\", for the musical documentary \"All This and World War II\".\nQuincy Jones hired them to play on his LP \"Mellow Madness\", and recorded four of their songs, including \"Is It Love That We're Missin'?\" and \"Just a Taste of Me\".\nAfter touring with various artists including Bobby Womack and Billy Preston, they were hired by Quincy Jones for a tour in Japan and produced their debut album \"Look Out for #1\", released in March 1976, which went to number 9 on the U.S. Billboard chart. Their \"Right on Time\" album was released in May 1977 and reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 200. \"Blam!!\" came out in August 1978 and reached number 7 on the Billboard 200.\nTwo of the band's songs were featured on the soundtrack of the 1976 film \"Mother, Jugs &amp; Speed\" and one on the 1997 film \"\". The instrumental track \"Thunder Thumbs and Lightnin' Licks\" refers to the brothers' nicknames. \"Get the Funk Out Ma Face\" was cowritten with Quincy Jones.\nTheir popular album \"Light Up the Night\" was released in March 1980 and rose to #5 on the Billboard 200. It was number 46 on the \"Top 100 LPs of 1980\" list in \"Rolling Stone\". The brothers self-produced the subsequent album, \"Winners\"; released in July 1981, it only reached #48 on the Billboard 200.\nAmong their most popular songs are \"I'll Be Good to You\" (\"Billboard\" Hot 100 #3 in 1976) which prominently featured Syreeta Wright, \"Strawberry Letter 23\" (Hot 100 #5 in 1977, originally recorded by Shuggie Otis), \"Ain't We Funkin' Now\" (1978), and \"Stomp!\" (Hot 100 #7 and Hot Dance Music/Club Play #1 in 1980). Their styles include funk, and R&amp;B ballads. Each album also included at least one instrumental cut that would either be considered light jazz (\"Tomorrow\", 1976; \"Q\", 1977; \"Streetwave\", 1978; \"Smilin' On Ya\", 1980; \"Tokyo\", 1984) or funk (\"Thunder Thumbs &amp; Lightnin' Licks\", 1976; \"Brother Man\", 1977; \"Mista' Cool\", 1978; \"Celebrations\", 1980).\n1982 split.\nThe duo split up in 1982 to pursue separate projects.\nLouis's solo work.\nLouis Johnson recorded a gospel music album in 1981 with his own group Passage, which included his then-wife Valerie Johnson and former Brothers Johnson percussionist/singer Richard Heath. He played bass on Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\". In 1985 he recorded a single, \"Kinky\", on Capitol Records; it appears on his \"Evolution\" album which was exclusively released in Europe that year. Louis then made 3 instructional videotapes for the Starlicks video-distribution company in which he shared his bass-playing skills. The first was released in 1985. He then settled down to enjoy family life with his wife and son, but by 1988 his then-manager Diane Taren talked him into going back into the recording studio. He started his bass academy during the 1990s and gave workshop clinics via his own Website. Louis Johnson died on May 21, 2015, age 60. His last performance was in 2013.\nTommy Johnson left the group and had a 29-year career with the Los Angeles Fire Department.\nGeorge's solo work.\nGeorge Johnson released one single in 1985, \"Back Against the Wall\", on Quincy Jones' own Qwest label. A complete album (recorded but unreleased) came from that session, as George confirmed when he and Louis were interviewed around 1987/88 for \"Blues &amp; Soul Magazine\" in the United Kingdom (see link below). George also delivered guitar work for Steve Arrington's album \"Dancing in the Key of Life\" (1985) and had ad-libbed vocals on the track \"Think Back And Remember\" from the \"Galaxian\" album by the Jeff Lorber Fusion, released in 1981 on Arista Records.\nVarious 1980s reunions and other projects.\nIn 1984 the brothers reunited in the recording studio. The resulting Leon Sylvers-produced LP, \"Out of Control\", did not equal their past success, but it did garner them another R&amp;B hit with \"You Keep Me Coming Back\". They teamed up again in 1988 to record \"Kickin\"', the title track of which (\"Kick It to the Curb\") was a collaboration with their then-neighbor Irene Cara. Although \"Kick It to the Curb\" became a minor hit, the album's success was even more limited.\nBetween the two albums, both George and Louis released their aforementioned solo material and also appeared on \"Street Shadows\", an album by keyboardist/arranger David Diggs, who had provided horn and string arrangements for \"Winners\", \"Blast!\", and Louis' \"Passage\". \"Last Night\", \"Street\"s opening track showcases George's bass-guitar playing. He previously showed his bass skills on tracks like \"Teaser\" from \"Winners\" and \"The Great Awakening\" from \"Blast\", the same way Louis shows his guitar skills on the duo's various compositions.\nAlso during this time, the band's song \"Tomorrow\" (originally an instrumental on the B-side of \"Get the Funk Out Ma Face\") was recorded with vocals by Tevin Campbell for Quincy Jones' \"Back on the Block\" release in 1989. This album also included Jones' hit remake of the Brothers Johnson's \"I'll Be Good to You\", featuring Ray Charles and Chaka Khan.\nBesides the brothers' brief appearance in Japan around 1994 and George guest-appearing at a Graham Central Station concert in Japan (including a released double-CD), the duo launched an expanded US tour in 2002 which got positive, wide exposure. It was visited by many fans and various artists in the entertainment business. Along with a website and discussion-forum, online visitors could share their experiences of the shows by wandering through the Land of Ladies and reliving Funkadelia's heyday. A few years later, a combi-release of live-CD + DVD was released under the name \"Strawberry Letter 23: Live\".\nIn 2006, Louis gave a duo-show with a drummer on the \"Poetry in Motion 1 Festival\" in Maryland. In late 2007 George performed with his own band at a Detroit festival, including a persona called Sir Nose. These days George performs with a special band, an initiative of Michael Henderson that includes Adina Howard, Cherrelle, Ray Parker Jr., and others.\nLouis Johnson was found dead at his home in Las Vegas, May 21, 2015. The cause of death was gastrointestinal bleeding of the esophagus.\nIn 2022, the brothers' song \"Ain't We Funkin' Now\" was sampled in singer Harry Styles' song 'Daydreaming\" from his third album \"Harry's House\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also titled La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101raratnas\u016btram (\"The Jewel Sutra of the Entry into La\u1e45k\u0101,\" Gunabhadra's Chinese title: \u695e\u4f3d\u963f\u8dcb\u591a\u7f85\u5bf6\u7d93 l\u00e9ngqi\u00e9 \u0101b\u00e1du\u014dlu\u00f3 b\u01ceoj\u012bng) and Saddharmala\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ras\u016btra (\"The Sutra on the Descent of the True Dharma into La\u1e45k\u0101\"). A subtitle to the sutra found in some sources is \"the heart of the words of all the Buddhas\" (\u4e00\u5207\u4f5b\u8a9e\u5fc3 yiqiefo yuxin, Sanskrit: \"sarvabuddhapravacanah\u1e5bdaya\"). \nThe \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra\" recounts a teaching primarily between Gautama Buddha and a bodhisattva named Mah\u0101mati (\"Great Wisdom\"). The s\u016btra is set in mythical La\u1e45k\u0101, ruled by R\u0101va\u1e47a, the king of the r\u0101k\u1e63asas. The \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra\" discusses numerous Mahayana topics, such as Yog\u0101c\u0101ra philosophy of mind-only (\"cittam\u0101tra\") and the three natures, the \"\u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na\" (store-house consciousness), the inner \"disposition\" (\"gotra\"), the buddha-nature, the luminous mind (\"prabh\u0101svaracitta\"), emptiness (\"\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101\") and vegetarianism. \nThe \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra\" was often quoted and paraphrased by Indian philosophers like Chandrakirti and Shantideva, and it also figured prominently in the development of East Asian Buddhism. It is notably an important s\u016btra in Chan/Zen Buddhism, as it discusses the key issue of \"sudden enlightenment\". The text survives in one Sanskrit manuscript from Nepal as well as in Tibetan and Han Chinese translation. \nOverview and main themes.\nVarious scholars like DT Suzuki and Takasaki Jikido have noted that the text is somewhat unsystematic and disorganized, resembling the notebook or commonplace book of a Mahayana master which recorded important teachings. According to Takasaki Jikido, the Lanka \"is, as often said, merely a mosaic collection of small parts put at random within the frame of a sutra.\" \nThe present Sanskrit edition contains ten chapters and most scholars consider the introductory chapter (the \"Ravana\" chapter), the ninth chapter (a dharani) and the last chapter (the \"Sagathakam\" verses) as being later additions. Furthermore, not all versions of the sutra contain these chapters (1, 9, 10). However, some verses found in the \"Sagathakam\" are also duplicates and are found within the main body of the sutra. Takasaki Jikido has argued that these verse portions might actually be the earliest core of the sutra, around which prose explanations grew. \nThe \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra\" draws on and explains numerous important Mahayana Buddhist concepts including the philosophy of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school, the doctrine of emptiness (\"\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101\"), and the doctrines of buddha-nature (\"tath\u0101gatagarbha\"), and the luminous mind (\"prabh\u0101svaracitta\"). In the introduction to the sutra (the \"nidana\"), the sutra outlines some key teachings which will be expounded on, \"the Five Dharmas and the Three Inherent Natures (pa\u00f1cadharmasvabh\u0101va), the Eight Consciousnesses (vij\u00f1\u0101na) and the Two forms of Selflessness (nair\u0101tmy\u0101dvaya).\" Indeed, the sutra later states that within this set of teachings is included \"all of the Mahayana\". \nAccording to Nguyen Dac Sy, the most important doctrines of the La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra are the primacy of consciousness (Skt. \"vij\u00f1\u0101navada\"), the teaching that consciousness as the only reality and that \"all the objects of the world, and the names and forms of experience, are manifestations of the mind\" as well as the \"identification of the Buddha-nature (in the state of \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\") with \"alayavij\u00f1\u0101na\".\"\nOther topics discussed in the sutra include Buddhist vegetarianism, the theory of icchantikas, the wrong views of non-buddhists (tirthikas, especially Samkhya), a critique of the sravakayana, the limited nature of language in describing the ultimate truth, the One Vehicle, the bodhisattva path, and the three bodies of the Buddha (trikaya) doctrine. \nSvacittam\u0101tra.\nThe \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra\" often presents a mind-only philosophy influenced by the idealistic thought of the Yogacara school. According to the \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra\" \"all things are only manifestations of the mind itself\" i.e. all phenomena are \"mind-only\" (\"cittam\u0101tra\") or \"ideation-only\" (\"vij\u00f1aptimatra\"). This idealistic view is explained by the \"Lanka\" as the view that \"what is seen as something external is nothing but one's own mind\" (\"svacitta-drsya-m\u0101tram\").\" According to Gishin Tokiwa, this is not to say that there are no independent external beings conventionally, but rather what it means is that true insight into the nature of reality goes beyond all concepts of internal and external. Gishin Tokiwa sees the theory of \"svacittam\u0101tra\" as the central message of the sutra. \nThe sutra often presents Yogacara theories of consciousness, like the eight consciousnesses and the three natures, as well as the \"five dharmas\". Furthermore, since, as the sutra states, the whole world \"is nothing but a complex manifestation of one's mental activities,\" all phenomena are empty of self (\"anatman\") and illusory (\"maya\") - \"to be regarded as forms seen in a vision and a dream, empty of substance, unborn and without self-nature.\"\nTokiwa further writes that the \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra,\" being closely influenced by Praj\u00f1aparamita thought, also tempers this idealistic mind-only view with the idea that ultimate reality transcends being and non-being (bh\u0101v\u0101bh\u0101va), and is beyond all views and concepts, even that of \"mind\" (citta) itself. Thus, even though the Lanka presents a \"mind-only\" view in some passages, other sections state that the ultimate truth or Suchness transcends even mind, thought, discrimination and subjectivity itself. Furthermore, the reason why all things are beyond being and non-being is closely connected to the idea that all experiences are mind only. It is because all experiences are just reflections of the mind of those deluded beings which experience them that we can say that phenomena have no single characteristic or way of existing. All things are experienced (or not experienced) in various ways (vaicitryam) by different types of living beings, but none of these experiences are fixed or ultimately true, each one is mistaken (bhranti) in some way. At the same time, we can say that this ultimate nature of the emptiness of all characteristics is something that does not change. This ultimate reality, the dharmakaya, is also free from arising, abiding and cessation while also being the ground for the illusory manifestation of the world. \nIn spite of this however, the view of \"mind-only\" is still seen as an important way to transcend our current deluded state, as the Lanka sutra states:Through attaining the reality as nothing but our own mind, which is the Self free from manifestation, we return to abiding in the final attainment of praj\u00f1a. In turn, the view that the world and phenomena exist \"externally\", outside of mind, is seen as a serious error that leads to delusion and suffering. The Lanka sutra specifically cites the dualistic view of Samkhya philosophy for criticism.\nThe Five Dharmas.\nAccording to Saganuma, the schema of the Five Dharmas (pa\u00f1cadharma), which explains all of reality in terms of five phenomena, is essential for understanding the basic worldview of the \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra\". Indeed, according to Saganuma, the \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra\" considers that all Mahayana teachings are included within these five dharmas. \nThe Five Dharmas are the following: \nThe \"Lanka\" also closely connects this theory with the Yogacara theory of the three inherent natures. According to the \"Lanka,\" image, naming and discrimination correspond to the parikalpita-svabh\u0101va (the \"fully conceptualized\" nature) and the paratantra-svabh\u0101va (dependent nature), while\u00a0right knowledge and Suchness correspond to the parini\u1e63panna-svabh\u0101va (the fully accomplished nature).\nThe buddha-nature and emptiness.\nA major topic found in the \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra\" are the teachings on \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\" (buddha-nature) also called \"buddhagotra\" (buddha disposition or buddha lineage) or \"tathagatagotra\", which is explained in many different ways throughout the sutra. The \"Lanka\" describes buddha-nature as \"the purity of natural luminosity, it is primordially pure, endowed with the thirty-two major marks, and hidden within the bodies of all sentient beings...just like a gem of great value wrapped in a stained cloth, it is wrapped up in the cloth of the skandhas, dh\u0101tus, and \u0101yatanas, is tainted by the stains of desire, hatred, ignorance, and false imagination but is permanent, eternal, peaceful, and everlasting\". \nBuddha-nature is also equated with the wisdom of noble beings, \"the attainment of the realization of suchness\" (tathata) and the perfected nature (\"parini\u1e63panna\"). Furthermore, the \"Lanka\" explains buddha-nature in a positive manner as the naturally luminous mind (\"prabh\u0101svaracitta\") and also equates it with the \"true self\" which is realized by \"those whose minds are not distracted by emptiness.\" \nHowever, the \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra\" also states that buddha-nature is not a self (atman), calls it selfless (nair\u0101tmya), and states that it is empty of self-nature. The Lanka further states that buddha-nature is merely a skillful means (upaya) of teaching the dharma to non-buddhists (t\u012brthikas) who cling to a self: \nMah\u0101mati, my instruction on the \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\" is not similar to the doctrine of the self of the t\u012brthikas. Rather, Mah\u0101mati, the tath\u0101gatas give the instruction on the \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\" as bearing the meaning of words such as emptiness, true end, nirv\u0101\u1e47a, nonarising, signlessness, and wishlessness. Thus, for the sake of relinquishing what makes naive beings afraid of the lack of a self, the tath\u0101gata arhats, the completely perfect buddhas, teach the sphere of nonconceptuality and nonappearance through the introductory instruction on the \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\"...Mah\u0101mati, the tath\u0101gatas teach the instruction on the \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\" through teaching the \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\" in order to attract the t\u012brthikas, who cling to the doctrine of the self. So how may those whose thinking falls into the views of conceiving an incorrect self and those who succumb to falling into the sphere of three [kinds of] liberation swiftly awaken to unsurpassable and completely perfect awakening? Mah\u0101mati, it is for their sake that the tath\u0101gata arhats, the completely perfect buddhas, give the instruction on the \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\". Therefore, this is not similar to the doctrine of a self of the t\u012brthikas. Consequently, in order to put an end to the views of the t\u012brthikas, they need to become followers of the heart of nonself of a tath\u0101gata (tath\u0101gatanair\u0101tmyagarbha). According to Brunnh\u00f6lzl, the \"Lanka\" further states that what \"all s\u016btras of all buddhas teach is nothing but emptiness, nonarising, nonduality, and the lack of nature\". The sutra also states that \"all characteristics of conceptions have terminated, either through the instruction on the \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\" or through the instruction on identitylessness\". Karl Brunnh\u00f6lzl notes that throughout various passages, the \"Lanka\" attempts to unify the positive buddha-nature teachings and the more negative emptiness teachings, presenting them as being equivalent to each other and as non-contradictory.\nThe storehouse consciousness and buddha-nature.\nIn other passages, the \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\" (\"buddha-womb\" or buddha-source) is also equated with the \"storehouse consciousness\" (Skt. \"\u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na\"), the most fundamental layer of consciousness which contains the karmic seeds of defilement. However, in other further passages, the \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\" is also said to be free from all eight consciousnesses and \"free from the characteristics of mind, without consciousness and mentation.\" \nAs noted by Brunnh\u00f6lzl, this paradoxical storehouse consciousness qua buddha-nature contains both contaminated and uncontaminated latent tendencies (\"anusaya\"). Further, it is both momentary and not momentary, it is the cause of virtue and non-virtue, it is the cause of all existences in sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, and thus it must be purified. But, at the same time, this same buddha-nature is described as indestructible, free from a self, naturally pure and free from the flaw of impermanence. It is compared to a dancer who does various performances and yet also to pure gold or a diamond that is never tarnished or changed. The Lanka sutra states that this buddha-nature storehouse-consciousness is something that cannot be fully understood by those who are not Buddhas. \nThe \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra\" explains this paradoxical buddha-nature consciousness which is defiled and yet undefiled as follows:Mah\u0101mati, the \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\" contains the causes of virtue and non-virtue and is the creator of all births and forms of existence. Free from a self and what is mine, like a dancer, it enters [all kinds of] dangerous forms of existence...Being impregnated by all kinds of beginningless latent tendencies of the impregnations of negative tendencies of discursiveness, it is called \"\u0101laya-consciousness.\" Its body, together with the seven consciousnesses that arise from the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance, always operates uninterruptedly, just like a great ocean and its waves, is free from the flaw of impermanence, is the cessation of the position of a self, and is utterly pure by nature. The seven consciousnesses such as mentation and the mental consciousness, which are other than this and arise and perish, are momentary, arise from the cause that is false imagination, focus on collections of shapes, activities, and distinct instances, cling to names and characteristics, do not understand that appearing forms and characteristics are one\u2019s own mind, do not discriminate happiness and suffering, are not the cause for liberation, arise through and give rise to names, characteristics, and rising desire, and have the [\u0101laya-consciousness] as their cause and support...However, if the \u0101laya-consciousness, which is known as \"the \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\",\" does not undergo a change (par\u0101v\u1e5btti), there is no cessation of the seven active consciousnesses. For what reason? Because the consciousnesses flourish by virtue of [the \u0101laya-consciousness\u2019s serving as] their cause and support, and [because the \u0101laya-consciousness] is not an object of any of the yogins [who are immersed] in the yogas of \u015br\u0101vakas, pratyekabuddhas, and t\u012brthikas. Even when one realizes one\u2019s own lack of a personal self and apprehends the specific and general characteristics of the skandhas, dh\u0101tus, and \u0101yatanas, this \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\" still flourishes. It terminates only through seeing the five dharmas, the three natures, and phenomenal identitylessness...Therefore, Mah\u0101mati, bodhisattva mah\u0101sattvas who have this special goal should purify the tath\u0101gata heart, which is known as \"the \u0101laya-consciousness.\" Thus, the fundamental mind (citta) or storehouse consciousness is seen by the \"Lanka\" as neither separate from nor united with the defiled latent tendencies. Like a white piece of clothing that remains white underneath but can be dirtied by dust.\"\nThe mistaken mind and the pure consciousness.\nIn some passages, the sutra also seems to divide the storehouse consciousness into two. In one passage these are called \"the ultimate \u0101laya-consciousness and the \u0101laya of cognizance (vij\u00f1apti),\" while in another passage, they are called \"the true nature of the mind\" (which is pure) and \"the mind that arises from mistakenness.\" D.T. Suzuki similarly notes that according to the \"La\u1e45k\u0101,\" the storehouse consciousness has two aspects \"the \u0100laya as it is in itself\", called p\u0101ram\u0101laya-vij\u00f1\u0101na (the 'incessant' or prabandha aspect), and \"the \u0100laya as mental representation\" (vij\u00f1aptir \u0101laya, the manifested or laksha\u1e47a aspect). Thus, it is the fluctuating (\"prav\u1e5bitti\") aspect of the storehouse consciousness that gets caught up in the discrimination and craving of the manas consciousness, while the primitively pure (\"prak\u1e5bitipuri\u015buddhi\") aspect of the storehouse does not. \nIndeed, this pure aspect of the storehouse consciousness is also called \"something that has been in existence since the very first\" (\"p\u016brvadharmasthitit\u0101,\" or \"paur\u0101\u1e47asthitidharmat\u0101\"). According to Suzuki, the most common terms for this ultimate reality include: Tathat\u0101 (\"suchness\" or \"thusness\"), as well as \"Satyat\u0101, \"the state of being true\", Bh\u016btat\u0101, \"the state of being real\", Dharmadh\u0101tu, \"realm of truth\", Nirvana, the Permanent (\"nitya\"), Sameness (\"samat\u0101\"), the One (\"advaya\"), Cessation (\"nirodha\"), the Formless (\"animitta\"), Emptiness (\"\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101\"), etc.\" \nIn yet another passage, the \"Lanka\" speaks of nine forms of consciousnesses (as opposed to the classic eight consciousnesses of Yogacara). This passage may have been the source of Param\u0101rtha\u2019s doctrine of the ninth consciousness, which he termed the *\"amalavij\u00f1\u0101na\" (pure consciousness). This distinction between an ultimate and a relative storehouse consciousness suggests that buddha-nature is not to be understood as completely equivalent with the storehouse consciousness, but rather is to be seen as the pure nature of the mind that remains once the mind has been purified of all adventitious stains (\u0101gantukamala).\nError, wisdom and awakening.\nAccording to the \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra\" suffering and ignorance arises when consciousness engages in discrimination, representation and conceptualization. This error leads to the egoic consciousness, the \"manas\", which considers phenomena as being real and permanent and thus to craving and attachment. The key error of the mind is to consider any phenomena as being something other than mind. \nMeanwhile, liberation and awakening (bodhi) arises when discrimination is brought to an end by a deep intuitive and non-conceptual knowledge (j\u00f1ana) of suchness (tathata). Awakening is the result of the bringing to an end of various activities of consciousness, such as the discrimination of the egoic consciousness (manas) and the latent tendencies of the storehouse consciousness\".\" As Gishin Tokiwa writes, awakening is attained when the discriminating storehouse consciousness \"ceases to be the ground and object of the seven vij\u00f1anas (consciousnesses)\" and when only the pure buddha-nature remains. \nThis radical reversal of the activities of consciousness is called the turning around of the basis (\"\u0101\u015braya-par\u0101v\u1e5btti\")\".\" To reach this radical transformation of the mind, the bodhisattva must purify his actions and thoughts (through Buddhist practices like ethical discipline and meditation) as well as develop insight into the nature of things (through hearing the teachings and meditating on emptiness)\".\" \nThe knowledge which knows the ultimate truth is a central topic of the Lanka and is variously termed praty\u0101tm\u0101ryaj\u00f1\u0101nagati (the state of noble knowledge realized by oneself), svapraty\u0101tma (inner self-realization), praty\u0101tmagati (that which is realized by oneself), praty\u0101tmagatigocara (the field realized by oneself) and praty\u0101tma dharmat\u0101 (the Dharma nature realized by oneself) in the sutra. Akira Suganuma writes that this \"inner wisdom\" is \"that which all the teachings in the \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ras\u016btra\" indicate to us is to realize or accomplish.\" \nAccording to D.T. Suzuki, this transcendental wisdom (aryaj\u00f1\u0101na) of the Lanka is \"an intuitive understanding which, penetrating through the surface of existence, sees into that which is the reason of everything logically and ontologically\" as well as \"a fundamental intuition into the truth of Mind-only and constitutes the Buddhist enlightenment.\" Suzuki notes that aryaj\u00f1\u0101na is also designated by other terms, such as \"pravicayabuddhi\" (\"an insight fixed upon the ultimate ground of existence\"), \"svabuddhi\" (innate understanding), \"nir\u0101bh\u0101sa\" or \"an\u0101bh\u0101sa\" (imagelessness), \"nirvikalpa\" (beyond discrimination / concepts). The noble wisdom stands in contrast to \"vikalpabuddhi\", discriminative understanding, a relative and conceptual kind of knowledge based on duality and pluralities.\nSudden and gradual purification.\nAn important passage in the \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra\" discusses how the purification of the mind occurs, and the passage states that it can occur gradually as well as suddenly. In this passage, the \"Lanka\" states that the purification of the mind can happen \"by degrees and not all at once. Like the gooseberry, which ripens by degrees,\" and immediately after it also states that awakening can also happen \"all at once\": Or just as a clear mirror reflects formless images all at once, tathagatas likewise purify the stream of perceptions of beings\u2019 minds by displaying pure, formless, undifferentiated realms all at once. Or just as the sun and moon illuminate images all at once, tathagatas likewise reveal the supreme realm of inconceivable wisdom all at once to those who have freed themselves of the habit-energy and misconceptions that are perceptions of their own minds. Or just as repository consciousness distinguishes such different perceptions of one\u2019s mind as the realms of the body, its possessions, and the world around it all at once, nishyanda buddhas likewise bring beings to maturity in whatever realm they dwell all at once and lead practitioners to reside in Akanishtha Heaven. This idea was important for the establishment of the East Asian Buddhist doctrine of sudden (dun \u9813) enlightenment, an important doctrine which was later widely debated and discussed in many traditions of Mahayana Buddhism, including Chan, Zen and Seon.\nThe Ultimate is beyond words.\nAnother important idea found in the \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra\" is how the ultimate reality (dharmata) transcends all language and conventional expressions and is free from verbal discrimination (\"v\u0101gvikalpa\"). Because ultimate reality is eternal, free from arising and ceasing, and cannot be grasped or cognized (\"anupalabdhi\") the sutra states that Buddhas \"do not teach the doctrine that is dependent letters (\"ak\u1e63arapatita\").\"\nBecause of this, all teachings in the sutra are not the ultimate, even though they point to the ultimate, like a finger pointing at the Moon. Thus, one should not become attached to the words of the sutra, to the letters (which are only provisional, \"sa\u1e41v\u1e5bti\") and instead should focus on the ultimate meaning (\"param\u0101rtha\"). The Lanka thus states:As the ignorant grasps the finger-tip (that points to the moon) and does not cognize the moon, so those who cling to the letter do not know my truth. The \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra\" also states that even though Buddhas teach (in conventional fashion), they have never uttered even a single letter or syllable (\"ak\u1e63ara)\":the Tathagatas neither uttered nor answered even a letter (\"ekam apy ak\u1e63aram\"), because truths are beyond the letters. It does not mean, however, that (the Tathagatas) never declare what is connected with the benefit (artha) of beings. Depending upon discrimination, they declare anything. If, Mahamati, they do not depend upon discrimination, the scriptures containing all the truths will disappear, and when the scriptures disappear there will be no Buddhas, Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas and Bodhisattvas; when they disappear, what is to be taught and to whom? For this reason, Mahamati, the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva should not cling to the words or letters in a canonical text...the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva should be in conformity with the meaning (\"artha-prati\u015bara\u1e47a\") and not with the letter (\"vya\u00f1jana\"). According to Charles Willemen, this teaching of the \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra\" is \"the basis for Chan\u2019s famous wordless teaching\" which sees Chan as being taught \"without words\" (\u8a00\u8bf4).\nHistory and editions.\nAccording to Asanga Tilakaratne, \"it is generally believed that the sutra was compiled during 350-400 CE,\" although \"many who have studied the sutra are of opinion that the introductory chapter and the last two chapters were added to the book at a later period.\" Christian Lindtner argues that some early recension of the \"Lankavatara\" influenced the writings of Nagarjuna and Aryadeva (3rd century), basing his conclusion on several close or literal allusions to the sutra in early madhyamaka texts. Thus, the core of the sutra could date to a much earlier time. The \"Lanka\" is quoted four times in the \"S\u016btrasamuccaya\" which has been attributed to N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (but this attribution has also been questioned by some scholars). Lambert Schmithausen has argued that the evidence attributing this text to Nagarjuna is insufficient and that furthermore, a passage from the \"Lankavatara\" seems to be a direct quotation from Vasubandhu's \"Trimsika\" (4th to 5th century CE). But the issue of the dating of the Lanka is further complicated by the complex nature of Vasubandhu's authorship of various texts and the fact that his \"Vy\u0101khy\u0101yukti\" also quotes the \"Lankavatara\". \nSome modern scholars like Gishin Tokiwa also surmise that the sutra may have been compiled in Sri Lanka between 411 and 435, during a time when Mahayana Buddhism was popular in the island (at sites like Abhayagiri vihara) and the island also received visits from Chinese pilgrims like Faxian. \nFour translations of the \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra\" were made from Sanskrit into the Chinese language between roughly 420 CE and 704, the earliest being attributed to Dharmarak\u1e63a in the 5th century.5 \nOf these, only three are now extant: \nIn addition to these Chinese translations, there are also two Tibetan translations, and a version of the Sanskrit was preserved in Nepal. One Tibetan translation is derived from the Sanskrit original, and the other is likely a translation of Gu\u1e47abhadra's Chinese into Tibetan.13\u201315 \nNanjo Bunyu prepared a critical edition of the Sanskrit in 1923 based on four manuscripts from the Nepalese recension, among other sources.xvii12 \nAccording to Gishin Tokiwa, the Sanskrit edition and Sik\u1e63\u0101nanda's translation contain various additions and errors. Tokiwa considers that \"the Gunabhadra version conveys the earliest, original Sanskrit text-form whereas the two other Chinese versions as well as the extant Sanskrit manuscripts that include the Nanjio-edition did not go through any kind of appropriate text-critique.\" Takasaki Jikido likewise argued that the Gunabhadra edition was the closest version available to the early Sanskrit edition. \nGishin Tokiwa has also published a reconstructed Sanskrit edition based on the extant Sanskrit manuscript and the Gunabhadra translation. \nThe earliest translations of the \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra\" are significantly shorter than later ones, which D.T. Suzuki interprets as suggesting that additions were made to the text over time.16 The first and last chapters (which connect the text with Ravana, the villain of the Ramayana, and adds a dharani) are missing from the earliest translation, and the prose of the first chapter in later translations does not agree with the verse-form provided alongside it.20 Suzuki also suggests that the chapter on meat eating, where the Theravada 'thrice clean' practice is criticized, may be a later edition based on its different tone and content from the rest of the text.20 Based on the text's lack of organization, varying and sometimes irrelevant chapter headings, and expansion over time, Suzuki suggests that it may have originated as a collection of individual passages summarizing essential Mahayana doctrines, which were later shaped into a narrative.19\u201320\nAnalysis and commentaries.\nAccording to Takasaki Jikido, because of this mosaic like character of the text, the best way to analyze the scripture has been \"to divide the whole text into small parts or sections according to their subjects.\" The first commentator to attempt this was the Japanese author Kokan Shiren, who in the 14th century divided the text into 86 sections with titles. Most of these sections (but not all) include a prose part followed by a verse section that recapitulates the prose teaching. \nChandrakirti argued that the text needed to be interpreted, and that it was \"not to be understood as a negation of form.\"\nIndian commentaries.\nThere are two traditional Indian commentaries preserved in Tibetan translations: \nThese commentaries mainly comment on the sutra by relying on the epistemological tradition of Dharmak\u012brti. J\u00f1\u0101navajra's commentary presents a unique Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-Sv\u0101tantrika-Madhyamaka perspective which was termed \u2018cognitive centrism\u2019 (\"vij\u00f1aptimadhyama, rnam rig dbu ma\") and he also heavily relies on the works of Kamala\u015b\u012bla, particularly the \"Madhyamak\u0101loka\". In this commentary, he also critiques the al\u012bk\u0101k\u0101ravada view of Yogacara philosophy\".\" According to H. Hadano, J\u00f1\u0101navajra's commentary \"takes the standpoint that the myriad pure and defiled dharmas are all manifestations of mind (citta), that they are not different to mind, and that they are mind-itself, in other words, the standpoint of the Rnam par rig pa tsam gyi dbu ma (vij\u00f1apti-m\u0101trika-m\u0101dhyamika) which considers sa\u1e43v\u1e5btti and param\u0101rtha as two sides of the same coin, and discards duality.\" \nEast Asian commentaries.\nThere are also numerous East Asian Buddhist commentaries on the Lanka, like the commentaries by Huayan Patriarchs Zhiyan and Fazang. According to John Jorgensen, Fazang's commentary explains ten key themes he finds in the sutra: \"1. the emptiness and existence in causation; 2.the fundamental and derived in the vij\u00f1\u0101nas; 3. the true and false in the substance of the vij\u00f1\u0101nas; 4. the seeds of the fundamental vij\u00f1\u0101na; 5. the universality of the Buddha-nature; 6. the turning around of the minds of the two vehicle (followers); 7. the opening and closing of the stages of practice; 8. the non-obstruction of barrier and cure; 9. the freedom of pro and contrary; and 10. the eternal persistence of the Buddha-result.\" Fazang considered the Lank\u0101vat\u0101ra to be one of the definitive sutras which taught the theme (zong) of \"the attribute of reality\" which teaches that consciousness is produced by buddha-nature. \nThe Lanka is also quoted and commented on in the \"Bodhidharma Anthology\" (i.e. the \"Putidamo sixing lun\"), an important text of early Chan Buddhism that contains material attributed to Bodhidharma and his students. Jorgensen also states that \"there is evidence that commentaries on the Lank\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra attributed to Bodhidharma reached Japan, some at least by 736.\" This \"Bodhidharma commentary...has to date from between 445 and 740\" and \"shares much in common with the theories of Jingying Huiyuan (523-592) of the Southern Dilun Faction, who quoted the Lank\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra as one of his authorities.\" \nVarious commentaries were written during the Song dynasty. Baochen, writing in the Northern Song dynasty era, also wrote a long commentary to the Lanka which was influenced by the \"Awakening of Faith\" and Huayan. Another commentary is that of the Chan monk Zhengshou (1146-1208) of the Xuedou lineage which provides a Chan perspective on the Lanka. The Tiantai monk Shanyue (1149-1241), also wrote a commentary to the Lanka. \nOne of the most important Japanese commentaries is Kokan Shiren\u2019s (1278-1346) \"Treatise on the Essence of the Buddha\u2019s Words\" (\"Butsugoshinron\" \u4f5b\u8a9e\u5fc3\u8ad6), in 18 scrolls \u5dfb, which was written in 1324. He ignores most Song dynasty commentaries, and only cites Zhiyan's early commentary. Kokan's commentary includes extensive polemics against Tendai Buddhism and Zhanran's views on the \"Lankavatara\". Kokan attempts to show that Zen is a superior and separate transmission of the Buddha\u2019s realization which stands entirely apart from all other Buddhist teaching, doctrine and scriptures and abandons all relative discourse, all \"words and letters.\" Kokan draws on the teachings of the \"Lankavatara\" on the perfect nature taught by the Dharmakaya to claim that Zen is a unique transmission of the realization of this perfect nature and that this is what Bodhidharma's transmission of \u201cseeing the nature and completing Buddhahood\u201d means. Another Japanese commentary was published in 1687 by Tokugan Yoson. \nDuring the Ming dynasty, various commentaries were written, such as those by the Chan-Pure Land-Tiantai master Ouyi Zhixu (including \u695e\u4f3d\u963f\u8dcb\u591a\u7f85\u5bf6\u7d93\u7fa9\u758f, \"Commentary on the Meanings of the La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra Jewel S\u016btra\"), the Huayan master Tongrun's \"Lengqie jing hezhe\" (\u695e\u4f3d\u7d93\u5408\u8f4d) and Jiaohong's (\u7126\u7ad1 1540\u20131620) \"Lengqie jing jing jie ping lin\" (\u695e\u4f3d\u7d93\u7cbe\u89e3\u8a55\u6797, \"Forest of Comments of Detailed Interpretations on Lankavatara Sutra\").\nEnglish translations.\nThe following are English translations of the Lankavatara sutra. \nFrom the Sanskrit edition: \nFrom the four-fascicle Chinese edition of Gunabhadra and the Sanskrit (restored on the basis of Gunabhadra's translation): \nComposite translations: \nThe Red Pine translation is a composite translation which draws on the four-fascicle Chinese edition of Gunabhadra as well as some additions from the \u015aik\u1e63\u0101nanda (652-710 CE) and Bodhiruchi translations (like the first \"Ravana\" introductory chapter). It also omits the \"Sag\u0101thakam\", the last chapter in the long version of the sutra, which is considered by many scholars to be a later addition.\nSuzuki's translation, though sub-titled as a translation from the Sanskrit, actually also draws on the Chinese translations along with the Sanskrit edition of Bunyu Nanjo (1923).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A two-time Grammy Award winner known for his bass voice and romantic image, his greatest success came in the 1970s as a solo singer and with the Love Unlimited Orchestra, crafting many enduring R&amp;B, soul, and disco songs such as his two biggest hits: \"Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe\" and \"You're the First, the Last, My Everything\".\nWhite recorded 20 studio albums during the course of his career, while multiple versions and compilations were released worldwide that were certified gold, 41 of which also attained platinum status. White had 20 gold and 10 platinum singles, with worldwide record sales in excess of 100\u00a0million records, and is one of the best-selling music artists of all time. His influences included James Cleveland, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, the Supremes, the Four Tops, and Marvin Gaye.\nEarly life.\nWhite was born Barry Eugene Carter on September 12, 1944, in Galveston, Texas. His father was Melvin A. White, and his mother was Sadie Marie Carter. Unbeknownst to his mother, his father was already married to another woman. She gave her son her last name. Upon seeing her last name of Carter on his son's birth certificate, Melvin scratched Carter out and wrote his own last name of White. He grew up in the Watts neighborhood of South Central Los Angeles, California. He was the older of two children; his brother Darryl was 13 months younger. White grew up listening to his mother's classical music collection and first took to the piano, emulating what he heard on the records.\nWhite has often been credited with playing piano, at age 11, on Jesse Belvin's 1956 hit single, \"Goodnight My Love\". However, in a 1995 interview with the \"Boston Herald\", White denied writing or arranging the song. He believed the story was an exaggeration by journalists. While White and Belvin lived in the same neighborhood, Belvin was 12 years older than White.\nWhite attended Jacob A. Riis High School, an all-boys academy in southeast Los Angeles. White's voice deepened suddenly when he was 13 or 14. He recalled: \"[As a child], I had a normal squeaky kid voice. Then as a teenager, that completely changed. My mother cried because she knew her baby boy had become a man.\" In a 2000 interview with Conan O'Brien, he further recalled: \"I woke up one morning when I was 14. I spoke to my mother, and I scared both of us.\" White also told the BBC that this happened when he was 13.\nWhite was jailed for four months at the age of 16 for stealing $30,000 worth of Cadillac tires (equivalent to about $ now). While in jail, he listened to Elvis Presley singing \"It's Now or Never\" on the radio, an experience he later credited with changing the course of his life. White had another moment of inspiration on his 18th birthday, which also was the first day back for his graduating year of high school. He skipped class to walk to Capitol Records headquarters in Hollywood and stood across the street from the office staring for hours. Seeing the liveliness of the area it inspired him to work in Hollywood, in the entertainment industry, despite not knowing how to read or write music.\nMusic career.\n1960s.\nAfter his release from jail, White left gang life and began a musical career at the beginning of the 1960s in singing groups. He first released \"Too Far to Turn Around\" in 1960 as part of the Upfronts before working for various small independent labels in Los Angeles. He also recorded several singles under his own name in the early 1960s, backed by vocal groups the Atlantics (for the Rampart and Faro labels) and the Majestics (for the Linda and Jordan labels). White had no involvement with Bob &amp; Earl's 1963 hit single \"Harlem Shuffle\", a song he has sometimes been credited with producing; in his 1999 autobiography, White confirmed the song had been produced by Gene Page, who had worked with him on many of his 1970s successes.\nIn 1965, White produced \"Feel Aw Right\" by the Bel Cantos, released on the Downey label. He recorded his debut single, \"Man Ain't Nothin'\"/\"I Don't Need It\", released under the name \"Lee Barry\" on Downey in 1966. He also co-wrote \"Together Forever\", released by Pat Powdrill &amp; the Powerdrills in 1967.\nIn the mid-'60s, Bob Keane of Del-Fi Records hired him as an A&amp;R man for his new Bronco Records imprint, and White started working with the label's artists, including Viola Wills and the Bobby Fuller Four, as a songwriter, session musician, and arranger. He discovered singer Felice Taylor and arranged her song \"I Feel Love Comin' On\", co-written with his friend Paul Politi. It became a big hit in the UK. Other charting hits written by White and Politi for her included \"It May Be Winter Outside (But in My Heart It's Spring)\" and \"Under the Influence of Love\". Bronco issued one of White's first singles, 1967's \"All in the Run of a Day\", produced by Keane and White itself. White also wrote \"Doin' the Banana Split\" for TV bubblegum pop act the Banana Splits in 1968.\nIn 1969, White was signed by Forward Records of Los Angeles, a division of Transcontinental Entertainment Corporation, as a producer.\n1970s as producer.\nIn 1972, White got his big break producing a girl group he had discovered called Love Unlimited. Formed in imitative style of the Motown girl group the Supremes, the group members had gradually honed their talents with White for two years until they signed contracts with Uni Records. His friend Paul Politi told him about music industry businessman Larry Nunes, who helped to finance their album. After it was recorded, Nunes took the recording to Russ Regan, who was the head of the Uni label owned by MCA. The album, 1972's \"From A Girl's Point of View We Give to You... Love Unlimited\", became the first of White's string of long-titled albums and singles.\nWhite produced, wrote and arranged their classic soul ballad \"Walkin' in the Rain with the One I Love\", which climbed to No. 14 in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Pop chart and No. 6 on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B chart in late 1972. It became White's first million selling single as a writer and producer. This single also reached No. 12 in the UK chart. White's voice can clearly be heard in this piece as he plays the lover who answers the phone call of the female lead.\nSoon after, Regan left Uni for 20th Century Records. Without Regan, White's relationship with Uni soured. With his relationship with Uni over and Love Unlimited contract-bound with the label, White was able to switch both his production deal and the group to 20th Century Records. They recorded several other hits throughout the 1970s, \"I Belong to You\", which spent over five months on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B chart in 1974 including a week at No. 1 and \"Under the Influence of Love Unlimited\", which hit No. 3 on the \"Billboard\" Pop album charts. White married the lead singer of the group, Glodean James, on July 4, 1974.\nThe Love Unlimited Orchestra.\nIn 1973, White created The Love Unlimited Orchestra, a 40-piece orchestral group to be used originally as a backing band for the girl-group Love Unlimited. However, White had other plans, and in 1973, he released a single with \"Love's Theme\" (written by him and played by the orchestra), which reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Pop charts. Later, in 1974, he made the first album of the Love Unlimited Orchestra, \"Rhapsody in White\", containing \"Love's Theme\". White would continue to make albums with the orchestra, achieving some successes such as: \"Rhapsody in White\"; \"Satin Soul\"; \"Forever in Love\"; \"Midnight Groove\"; \"My Sweet Summer Suite\", Remake of \"Theme From King Kong\". The orchestra ceased to make albums in 1983 but continued to support White as a backing band.\n1970s solo career.\nWhite wanted to work with another act, but decided to work with a solo male artist. While working on a few demos for a male singer, he made three song demos of himself singing and playing, but Nunes heard them and insisted that he re-record and release them himself as a solo recording artist. After arguing for days about it, White was finally persuaded to release the songs himself, although he was initially reluctant to step out behind the microphone.\nHe then wrote several other songs and recorded them for what eventually became an entire album of music. He was going to use the name \"White Heat\", but decided on using his given name instead. White was still hesitating up to the time the label copy was made. It eventually became White's first solo album, 1973's \"I've Got So Much to Give\". It included the title track and his first solo chart hit, \"I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby\", which also rose to No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B charts as well as No. 3 on the \"Billboard\" Pop charts in 1973 and stayed in the top 40 for many weeks.\nOther chart hits by White included:\namong others.\nWhite also had a strong following in the UK, where he scored five Top 10 hits and a No. 1 for \"You're the First, the Last, My Everything\". Due to his large frame, facial hair, and deep voice, he was given the nickname \"The Walrus of Love\" in the UK and in the US, \"Dr. Love\", \"Mr. Love\", \"Prince of Pillow Talk\", \"Ambassador of Romance\", \"King of Disco\" \"The Maestro\" or \"Guru of Love\".\nAfter six years, White left 20th Century in 1979 to launch his own label, Unlimited Gold, with CBS/Columbia Records.\n1980s.\nAlthough his success on the pop charts slowed down as the disco era came to an end, he maintained a loyal following throughout his career. Despite several albums over the next three years, he failed to repeat his earlier successes, with no singles managing to reach the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, except for 1982's \"Change\", climbing into the Billboard R&amp;B Top 20 (No. 12). His label venture was exacting a heavy financial cost on White, so he concentrated on mostly touring and finally folded his label in 1983.\nAfter four years, he signed with A&amp;M Records, and with the release of 1987's \"The Right Night &amp; Barry White\", the single entitled \"Sho' You Right\" made it to the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B charts, peaking at No. 17.\nIn 1989, he released \"The Man Is Back!\" and with it had three top 40 singles on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B charts: \"Super Lover\", which made it to No. 34, \"I Wanna Do It Good to Ya\", which made it to No. 26, and \"When Will I See You Again\", which made it to No. 32.\n1990s.\nA 1970s nostalgia fad allowed White to enjoy a renewed wave of popularity in the 1990s. After participating in the song \"The Secret Garden (Sweet Seduction Suite)\" from Quincy Jones's 1989 album \"Back on the Block\", White mounted an effective comeback with several albums, each more successful than the one before. He returned to the top of the charts in 1991 with the album \"Put Me in Your Mix\", which reached No. 8 on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B Albums chart and the song by the same name reached No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B singles chart.\nIn 1994, White released \"The Icon Is Love\", which went to No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B album charts, and the single \"Practice What You Preach\" gave him his first No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B singles chart in almost 20 years. The album was nominated for a Grammy in the Best R&amp;B Album category, but lost to TLC's \"CrazySexyCool\".\nIn 1996, White recorded the duet \"In Your Wildest Dreams\" with Tina Turner. 1996 also saw the release of \"Space Jam\" and its soundtrack, on which White had a duet with Chris Rock, called \"Basketball Jones\", a remake of Cheech &amp; Chong's \"Basketball Jones\" from 1973.\nWhite's final album, 1999's \"Staying Power\", resulted in his last hit song \"Staying Power\", which placed No. 45 on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B charts. The single won him two Grammy Awards in the categories Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance and Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance.\nHis autobiography, \"Love Unlimited\", written with Marc Eliot, was published in 1999 by Broadway Books.\nActing career.\nOver the course of his career, White occasionally did voice-over work for television and movies. He voiced the character Brother Bear in the film \"Coonskin\" (1975). White voiced himself twice in the fourth season of \"The Simpsons\", in the episodes \"Whacking Day\" and \"Krusty Gets Kancelled\".\nWhite played the role of a bus driver for a Prodigy commercial in 1995, and he also portrayed the voice of a rabbit in a Good Seasons salad-dressing-mix commercial, singing a song called \"You Can't Bottle Love\". In addition, he narrated car commercials, including for Oldsmobile, and later on, Jeep. White also provided voice-over for Arby's Restaurant commercials on television and radio to promote its \"Market Fresh\" menu. White narrated Apple's first iBook commercial. White made three guest appearances on the comedy-drama television series \"Ally McBeal\", as his music was often featured on the show in dream sequences.\nPersonal life.\nMarriages.\nWhite was first married to his childhood sweetheart, identified only as \"Mary\" in his autobiography, by the time he was 19. They separated in 1969 and later divorced.\nIn 1974, White married singer Glodean James. The couple collaborated on the 1981 album \"Barry &amp; Glodean\". They reportedly separated in 1988, but they were still legally married until White's death in 2003, although they lived separate lives. Although estranged from White for over a decade, as his widow she was made sole executor of his estate.\nChildren.\nWhite had nine children. By the age of 16, White had fathered two children with his first wife Mary. They had four children together. In 2017, his son Darryl White from his first marriage sued his estate, claiming he was cut off financially.\nWhite had four children with his second wife Glodean James. Their daughter Shaherah was his personal assistant. Barry Jr. played in the Love Unlimited Orchestra and was also his tour manager. White's son MacKevin worked in his publishing administration.\nWhite had a daughter, Denise Donnell, born in 1962 to Gurtha Allen. She did not discover who her biological father was until 1988. She was accepted by White and with his help she changed her name to Denise White. In 2016, she sued White's estate after she stopped receiving money.\nAfter White's death in 2003, his girlfriend Katherine Denton claimed her infant daughter Barriana was his biological child. Denton also claimed that she was owed money and personal items that White had promised to give her. Paternity tests revealed that he was not the father of her child and Denton subsequently lost her court case.\nHealth problems and death.\nWhite was overweight for most of his adult life. \nHe reportedly weighed up to .\nWhile undergoing dialysis and awaiting a kidney transplant in May 2003, White suffered a severe stroke, which forced him to retire from public life. He also suffered multiple seizures in his last few weeks.\nWhite's unstable health prevented him from receiving a new kidney, and he died of kidney failure at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on July 4, 2003, at the age of 58. His remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered in the ocean off the California coast.\nLegacy.\nOn September 20, 2004, White was posthumously inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame at a ceremony held in New York. On September 12, 2013, which would have been White's 69th birthday, he was posthumously awarded the 2,506th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6914 Hollywood Boulevard in the category of recording. The show \"Counting Cars\" paid tribute to White by restoring the last car he owned for his widow, Glodean.\nIn an obituary referring to White by his nickname, \"The Walrus of Love\", the BBC recalled \"the rich timbres of one of the most distinctive soul voices of his generation, about which it was once said: 'If chocolate fudge cake could sing, it would sound like Barry White.'\"\nIn 2023, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked White at number 56 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.\nAwards and nominations.\nWhite was nominated for 11 Grammy Awards, winning two for \"Staying Power\" at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2000.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "56397", "revid": "20957809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56397", "title": "Steven Brust", "text": "American fantasy and science fiction author (born 1955)\nSteven Karl Zolt\u00e1n Brust (born November 23, 1955) is an American fantasy and science fiction author of Hungarian descent. He is best known for his series of novels about the assassin Vlad Taltos, one of a disdained minority group of humans living on a world called Dragaera. His recent novels also include \"The Incrementalists\" (2013) and its sequel \"The Skill of Our Hands\" (2017), with co-author Skyler White.\nAs a drummer and singer-songwriter, Brust has recorded one solo album and two albums as a member of Cats Laughing. Brust also co-wrote songs on two albums recorded in the mid-1990s by the band Boiled in Lead.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWriting career.\nThe Dragaeran books.\nThe Vlad Taltos series, written as high fantasy with a science fiction underpinning, is set on a planet called Dragaera. The events of the series take place in an Empire mostly inhabited and ruled by the Dragaerans, a genetically engineered humanoid species, having characteristics such as greatly extended lifespans and heights averaging about seven feet. Referred to as \"elfs\" by some humans, they refer to themselves as \"human\". The Dragaeran Empire controls a region that is \"enclouded\" by a perpetual overcast that blocks the sun from view.\nVlad Taltos is one of the human minority (known by Dragaerans as \"Easterners\"), which exists as a lower class in the Empire. Vlad also practices the human art of witchcraft; \"t\u00e1ltos\" is Hungarian for a kind of supernatural person in folklore. Though human, he is a citizen of the Empire because his social-climbing father bought a title in one of the less reputable of the 17 Dragaeran Great Houses. The only Great House that sells memberships this way is, not coincidentally, also the one that maintains a criminal organization. Vlad proves surprisingly successful in this organization. Despite being a human and a criminal, he has a number of high-ranking Dragaeran friends and often gets caught up in important events.\nBrust has written 17 published novels in the series, which is proposed to run to nineteen novels\u00a0\u2013 one named for each of the Great Houses, one named for Vlad himself (\"Taltos\"), and a final novel which Brust has said will be titled \"The Final Contract\". The first three novels resemble private-eye detective stories, perhaps the closest being Robert B. Parker's Spenser series. The later novels are more varied than the first three. Though they read like fantasy, there are science-fictional explanations for some things.\nBrust has also written another series set in Dragaera, the \"Khaavren Romances\", set centuries before Vlad's time. Since Dragaerans live for thousands of years, many characters appear in both series. It is partly an homage to Alexandre Dumas p\u00e8re's novels about The Three Musketeers, and is five volumes long, following the pattern of Dumas' series. The books are presented as historical novels written by Paarfi of Roundwood, a Dragaeran roughly contemporary with Vlad. Paarfi's old-fashioned, elaborate, and highly verbose writing is explicitly based on Dumas', though with a dialogue style that is, at times, based on Tom Stoppard's wordgames in \"Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead\" (according to Pamela Dean's introduction to \"Five Hundred Years After\"). \"The Baron of Magister Valley\", an additional Paarfi novel, is modeled after Dumas's \"The Count of Monte Cristo\".\nThe two series are finally brought together in the thirteenth novel in the Vlad series, \"Tiassa\", which can also be viewed as the sixth novel in the Khaavren series. \"Tiassa\" comprises what are in effect three related novellas, each told in a different style and connected by a common theme. The first section reads like the first three novels in the series, with first-person narration by Vlad but including Khaavren's son, Piro; the second section has a different viewpoint character in each of its chapters; and the third section is narrated by Paarfi in the style of the earlier \"Khaavren Romances\", with Khaavren as the viewpoint character and interacting with Vlad.\nShort stories.\nMost of Brust's short stories are set in shared universes. These include Emma Bull's and Will Shetterly's \"Liavek\", Robert Asprin's \"Thieves' World\", Neil Gaiman's \"Sandman\" and Terri Windling's \"Borderland Series\".\nStyle and literary theory.\nBrust was a founding member of a Minnesota-based writers' group called The Scribblies, which included Emma Bull, Pamela Dean, Will Shetterly, Nate Bucklin, Kara Dalkey, and Patricia Wrede. He also was a founding member of the Pre-Joycean Fellowship.\nHe has rejected a distinction between science fiction and fantasy, stating that no belief in such a distinction can withstand an encounter with the writing of Roger Zelazny.\nWriting style.\nThere is a certain amount of variation in the writing style amongst the Taltos novels, as well as between Brust's various series. Brust uses a different narrative approach in almost every novel in the Taltos series. Some of these approaches are more purely stylistic and have minor effects on the actual story-telling; some are profound and involve the point of view of characters whom the reader never expected to get to know so well.\nFurther, as the writing of the Taltos novels has spanned over four decades, they have been influenced by events in Brust's own life. A fascination with the Mafia\u00a0\u2013 subsequently brought into a somewhat shocking perspective by the murder of a friend\u00a0\u2013 profoundly influenced his storylines, as did the breakup of his marriage. The events and arguments of his books, especially \"Teckla\", are acknowledged by Brust to be influenced by his lifelong interest in Marxist theory and practice. Brust's parents were activists in the Workers League, the predecessor to the Socialist Equality Party, and he continues to identify as a \"Trotskyist sympathizer,\" linking to the SEP-affiliated World Socialist Web Site on his personal website. He endorsed the SEP's presidential candidates in the 2016 US elections.\nLiterary theory.\nIn contrast to contemporary academic studies in literature, Brust has put forward what he called \"The Cool Stuff Theory of Literature\":\nAll literature consists of whatever the writer thinks is cool. The reader will like the book to the degree that he agrees with the writer about what's cool. And that works all the way from the external trappings to the level of metaphor, subtext, and the way one uses words. In other words, I happen not to think that full-plate armor and great big honking greatswords are cool. I don't like 'em. I like cloaks and rapiers. So I write stories with a lot of cloaks and rapiers in 'em, 'cause that's cool. Guys who like military hardware, who think advanced military hardware is cool, are not gonna jump all over my books, because they have other ideas about what's cool.\nBrust elaborated, \"The novel should be understood as a structure built to accommodate the greatest possible amount of cool stuff.\"\nMotifs.\nThe character Devera, usually a cute brown-eyed girl of about nine, appears as a motif in all of Brust's novels. In the Dragaeran books, her name is Devera. She is the (future) daughter of another character and seems to be able to appear anywhere in time and space. In Brust's non-Dragaeran books her appearances are usually brief and not always obvious.\nMusical recordings and performances.\nBrust is a singer-songwriter and drummer who has recorded a solo album, and who has played in the Minneapolis-based folk rock band Cats Laughing, and with the Albany Free Traders, and Morrigan.\nBrust also co-wrote two songs on the 1994 album \"Antler Dance\" by the band Boiled in Lead (BiL), as well as many of the songs on BiL's 1995 multimedia CD \"Songs from The Gypsy\".\nCats Laughing.\n Cats Laughing released two albums with Brust as the drummer, in 1988 and 1990. Brust also contributed as a songwriter and vocalist. The 1990 album \"Another Way to Travel\" features cover art that depicts the band members and a vehicle known as the Catmobile, the band vehicle for Cats Laughing. The car, owned by Brust, was a Cadillac ambulance, painted yellow, light blue, and dark blue, with murals.\nOn April 3, 2015, Brust performed as part of Cats Laughing in a reunion concert at the Minicon 50 science fiction convention in Bloomington, Minnesota. In March 2016, Cats Laughing released a double CD of their 2015 reunion, \"A Long Time Gone\", as well as a DVD by the same title with documentary concert footage.\nSolo.\n\"A Rose for Iconoclastes\", a folk (or folk pop) album released in 1993, is Brust's only solo album. The title is a reference to \"A Rose for Ecclesiastes\", a short story by Brust's literary hero and mentor Roger Zelazny.\nTwelve of the fourteen songs were written or co-written by Brust. The album was produced by Adam Stemple, a fellow fantasy writer and member of Cats Laughing.\n\"Songs from The Gypsy\" (1995).\n The 1995 enhanced CD \"Songs from The Gypsy\", by the band Boiled in Lead, featured songs written by Brust and Adam Stemple, as well as the full text of Brust's novel \"The Gypsy.\"\nAllMusic reviewer Steven McDonald called \"Songs from The Gypsy\" \"an example of Brust's serious songwriting working well.\"\nConversely, a critical review by AllMusic's Roch Parisien emphasized that \"\"Songs from The Gypsy\" represents a failure of multimedia integration. As an audio CD, the disc serves up ten songs, ranging from acoustic trad to bluesy rockers, that ironically form a less cohesive whole than previous Boiled in Lead releases. The better numbers (like the title track) incorporate Celtic rock with Hungarian, Middle Eastern, and other interesting worldbeat influences.\" Parisien found the album's integration with the novel unsuccessful, in that the novel's 17 chapters were presented as \"scrollable text only, which also intersperse some 80 song lyric excerpts that you can play from hot buttons. Annoyingly, you must flip back to the main menu index to move from one chapter to the next.\" Parisien concluded, \"Despite Brust's engrossingly poetic, impressionist story inspired by Hungarian folk tales and revolving around three Gypsy brothers, the project does not overcome the primary limitation of bringing literature to the computer screen, that being that the computer offers an inhospitable environment for viewing literature-length text.\" The review, written in 1995, predated a wave of popular e-book readers that began to emerge about ten years later.\nOther performances.\nBrust has performed dramatically in several Shockwave Radio Theater productions, notably \"Closing Ceremonies (aka The Fall of the House of Usherette)\" and \"PBS Liavek\".\nAward nominations.\nBrust's short story \"When The Bow Breaks\" was nominated for the 1998 Nebula Award.\n\"Five Hundred Years After\" was nominated for the 1995 Locus Poll Award (Best Fantasy Novel). Other novels nominated for various Locus Poll Awards were \"Brokedown Palace,\" \"The Gypsy,\" \"Agyar,\" and \"Freedom &amp; Necessity.\"\n\"Dragon\" was a finalist for the 1999 Minnesota Book Awards in the Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction category. \"Freedom and Necessity\" was a 1998 finalist for the same category, while \"The Phoenix Guards\" was a finalist in 1992.\nBrust discovered in August 2006 that he had made the \"New York Times\" extended bestseller list at number 30 with \"Dzur\". He mentioned his ambivalence on this subject online. \"SciFi Wire\" posted an interview with Brust after \"Dzur\" came out.\nTranslations.\nBrust's novels have been translated into several languages, including German, French, Dutch and Hungarian.\nBibliography.\nDragaera.\nPaarfi's historical romances.\nHistorical romances, in effect, taking place centuries prior to the works featuring Vlad Taltos, with some overlap of characters. It was written as if by Paarfi of Roundwood, a Dragaeran historian. The fictional \"author\" regards these novels as works of history written for a popular audience, and published with great success during the reigns of Empresses Zerika IV and Norathar II.\n# \"The Phoenix Guards\" (1991)\n# \"Five Hundred Years After\" (1994)\n# \"The Paths of the Dead\" (2002) \u2013 Vol. 1 of \"The Viscount of Adrilankha\"\n# \"The Lord of Castle Black\" (2003) \u2013 Vol. 2 of \"The Viscount of Adrilankha\"\n# \"Sethra Lavode\" (2004) \u2013 Vol. 3 of \"The Viscount of Adrilankha\"\nVlad Taltos.\nThere are currently 17 novels in the series, with a total of 19 planned.

{"id": "56398", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56398", "title": "Phase diagram", "text": "Chart used to show conditions at which physical phases of a substance occur\nA phase diagram in physical chemistry, engineering, mineralogy, and materials science is a type of chart used to show conditions (pressure, temperature, etc.) at which thermodynamically distinct phases (such as solid, liquid or gaseous states) occur and coexist at equilibrium.\nOverview.\nCommon components of a phase diagram are \"lines of equilibrium\" or \"phase boundaries\", which refer to lines that mark conditions under which multiple phases can coexist at equilibrium. Phase transitions occur along lines of equilibrium. Metastable phases are not shown in phase diagrams as, despite their common occurrence, they are not equilibrium phases.\nTriple points are points on phase diagrams where lines of equilibrium intersect. Triple points mark conditions at which three different phases can coexist. For example, the water phase diagram has a triple point corresponding to the single temperature and pressure at which solid, liquid, and gaseous water can coexist in a stable equilibrium ( and a partial vapor pressure of ). The pressure on a pressure-temperature diagram (such as the water phase diagram shown) is that of the substance in question (e.g., the environmental pressure for a condensed state and the partial pressure for the gas state). \nThe solidus is the temperature below which the substance is stable in the solid state. The liquidus is the temperature above which the substance is stable in a liquid state. There may be a gap between the solidus and liquidus; within the gap, the substance consists of a mixture of crystals and liquid (like a \"slurry\").\nWorking fluids are often categorized on the basis of the shape of their phase diagram.\n2-dimensional diagrams.\nPressure vs temperature.\n The simplest phase diagrams are pressure\u2013temperature diagrams of a single simple substance, such as water. The axes correspond to the pressure and temperature. The phase diagram shows, in pressure\u2013temperature space, the lines of equilibrium or phase boundaries between the three phases of solid, liquid, and gas.\nThe curves on the phase diagram show the points where the free energy (and other derived properties) becomes non-analytic: their derivatives with respect to the coordinates (temperature and pressure in this example) change discontinuously (abruptly). For example, the heat capacity of a container filled with ice will change abruptly as the container is heated past the melting point. The open spaces, where the free energy is analytic, correspond to single phase regions. Single phase regions are separated by lines of non-analytical behavior, where phase transitions occur, which are called phase boundaries.\nIn the diagram on the right, the phase boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely. Instead, it terminates at a point on the phase diagram called the critical point. This reflects the fact that, at extremely high temperatures and pressures, the liquid and gaseous phases become indistinguishable, in what is known as a supercritical fluid. In water, the critical point occurs at around \"T\"c = , \"p\"c = and \"\u03c1\"c = 356\u00a0kg/m3.\nThe existence of the liquid\u2013gas critical point reveals a slight ambiguity in labelling the single phase regions. When going from the liquid to the gaseous phase, one usually crosses the phase boundary, but it is possible to choose a path that never crosses the boundary by going to the right of the critical point. Thus, the liquid and gaseous phases can blend continuously into each other. The solid\u2013liquid phase boundary can only end in a critical point if the solid and liquid phases have the same symmetry group.\nFor most substances, the solid\u2013liquid phase boundary (or fusion curve) in the phase diagram has a positive slope so that the melting point increases with pressure. This is true whenever the solid phase is denser than the liquid phase. The greater the pressure on a given substance, the closer together the molecules of the substance are brought to each other, which increases the effect of the substance's intermolecular forces. Thus, the substance requires a higher temperature for its molecules to have enough energy to break out of the fixed pattern of the solid phase and enter the liquid phase. A similar concept applies to liquid\u2013gas phase changes.\nWater is an exception which has a solid-liquid boundary with negative slope so that the melting point decreases with pressure. This occurs because ice (solid water) is less dense than liquid water, as shown by the fact that ice floats on water. At a molecular level, ice is less dense because it has a more extensive network of hydrogen bonding which requires a greater separation of water molecules. Other exceptions include antimony and bismuth. \nAt very high pressures above 50 GPa (500 000 atm), liquid nitrogen undergoes a liquid-liquid phase transition to a polymeric form and becomes denser than solid nitrogen at the same pressure. Under these conditions therefore, solid nitrogen also floats in its liquid.\nThe value of the slope d\"P\"/d\"T\" is given by the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron equation for fusion (melting)\nformula_1\nwhere \u0394\"H\"fus is the heat of fusion which is always positive, and \u0394\"V\"fus is the volume change for fusion. For most substances \u0394\"V\"fus is positive so that the slope is positive. However for water and other exceptions, \u0394\"V\"fus is negative so that the slope is negative.\nOther thermodynamic properties.\nIn addition to temperature and pressure, other thermodynamic properties may be graphed in phase diagrams. Examples of such thermodynamic properties include specific volume, specific enthalpy, or specific entropy. For example, single-component graphs of temperature vs. specific entropy (\"T\" vs. \"s\") for water/steam or for a refrigerant are commonly used to illustrate thermodynamic cycles such as a Carnot cycle, Rankine cycle, or vapor-compression refrigeration cycle.\nAny two thermodynamic quantities may be shown on the horizontal and vertical axes of a two-dimensional diagram. Additional thermodynamic quantities may each be illustrated in increments as a series of lines\u2014curved, straight, or a combination of curved and straight. Each of these iso-lines represents the thermodynamic quantity at a certain constant value.\n3-dimensional diagrams.\nIt is possible to envision three-dimensional (3D) graphs showing three thermodynamic quantities. For example, for a single component, a 3D Cartesian coordinate type graph can show temperature (\"T\") on one axis, pressure (\"p\") on a second axis, and specific volume (\"v\") on a third. Such a 3D graph is sometimes called a \"p\"\u2013\"v\"\u2013\"T\" diagram. The equilibrium conditions are shown as curves on a curved surface in 3D with areas for solid, liquid, and vapor phases and areas where solid and liquid, solid and vapor, or liquid and vapor coexist in equilibrium. A line on the surface called a triple line is where solid, liquid and vapor can all coexist in equilibrium. The critical point remains a point on the surface even on a 3D phase diagram.\nAn orthographic projection of the 3D \"p\"\u2013\"v\"\u2013\"T\" graph showing pressure and temperature as the vertical and horizontal axes collapses the 3D plot into the standard 2D pressure\u2013temperature diagram. When this is done, the solid\u2013vapor, solid\u2013liquid, and liquid\u2013vapor surfaces collapse into three corresponding curved lines meeting at the triple point, which is the collapsed orthographic projection of the triple line.\nBinary phase diagrams.\nOther much more complex types of phase diagrams can be constructed, particularly when more than one pure component is present. In that case, concentration becomes an important variable. Phase diagrams with more than two dimensions can be constructed that show the effect of more than two variables on the phase of a substance. Phase diagrams can use other variables in addition to or in place of temperature, pressure and composition, for example the strength of an applied electrical or magnetic field, and they can also involve substances that take on more than just three states of matter.\nOne type of phase diagram plots temperature against the relative concentrations of two substances in a binary mixture called a \"binary phase diagram\", as shown at right. Such a mixture can be either a solid solution, eutectic or peritectic, among others. These two types of mixtures result in very different graphs. Another type of binary phase diagram is a \"boiling-point diagram\" for a mixture of two components, i. e. chemical compounds. For two particular volatile components at a certain pressure such as atmospheric pressure, a boiling-point diagram shows what vapor (gas) compositions are in equilibrium with given liquid compositions depending on temperature. In a typical binary boiling-point diagram, temperature is plotted on a vertical axis and mixture composition on a horizontal axis.\nA two component diagram with components A and B in an \"ideal\" solution is shown. The construction of a liquid vapor phase diagram assumes an ideal liquid solution obeying Raoult's law and an ideal gas mixture obeying Dalton's law of partial pressure. A tie line from the liquid to the gas at constant pressure would indicate the two compositions of the liquid and gas respectively.\nA simple example diagram with hypothetical components 1 and 2 in a non-azeotropic mixture is shown at right. The fact that there are two separate curved lines joining the boiling points of the pure components means that the vapor composition is usually not the same as the liquid composition the vapor is in equilibrium with. See Vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium for more information.\nIn addition to the above-mentioned types of phase diagrams, there are many other possible combinations. Some of the major features of phase diagrams include congruent points, where a solid phase transforms directly into a liquid. There is also the peritectoid, a point where two solid phases combine into one solid phase during cooling. The inverse of this, when one solid phase transforms into two solid phases during cooling, is called the eutectoid.\nA complex phase diagram of great technological importance is that of the iron\u2013carbon system for less than 7% carbon (see steel).\nThe x-axis of such a diagram represents the concentration variable of the mixture. As the mixtures are typically far from dilute and their density as a function of temperature is usually unknown, the preferred concentration measure is mole fraction. A volume-based measure like molarity would be inadvisable.\nTernary phase diagrams.\nA system with three components is called a ternary system. At constant pressure the maximum number of independent variables is three \u2013 the temperature and two concentration values. For a representation of ternary equilibria a three-dimensional phase diagram is required. Often such a diagram is drawn with the composition as a horizontal plane and the temperature on an axis perpendicular to this plane. To represent composition in a ternary system an equilateral triangle is used, called Gibbs triangle (see also Ternary plot). \nThe temperature scale is plotted on the axis perpendicular to the composition triangle. Thus, the space model of a ternary phase diagram is a right-triangular prism. The prism sides represent corresponding binary systems A-B, B-C, A-C.\nHowever, the most common methods to present phase equilibria in a ternary system are the following:\n1) projections on the concentration triangle ABC of the liquidus, solidus, solvus surfaces;\n2) isothermal sections;\n3) vertical sections.\nCrystals.\nPolymorphic and polyamorphic substances have multiple crystal or amorphous phases, which can be graphed in a similar fashion to solid, liquid, and gas phases.\nMesophases.\nSome organic materials pass through intermediate states between solid and liquid; these states are called mesophases. Attention has been directed to mesophases because they enable display devices and have become commercially important through the so-called liquid-crystal technology. Phase diagrams are used to describe the occurrence of mesophases.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the capital of the province of Gelderland, located on both banks of the rivers Nederrijn and Sint-Jansbeek, which was the source of the city's development.\nArnhem is home to the Hogeschool van Arnhem en Nijmegen, ArtEZ Institute of the Arts, Netherlands Open Air Museum, Airborne Museum 'Hartenstein', Royal Burgers' Zoo, NOC*NSF and National Sports Centre Papendal. The north corner of the municipality is part of the Hoge Veluwe National Park. It is approximately in area, consisting of heathlands, sand dunes, and woodlands.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe oldest archeological findings of human activity around Arnhem are two firestones of about 70,000 years ago. These come from the Stone Age, when the Neanderthals lived in this part of Europe. In Schuytgraaf, remnants of a hunters camp from around 5000 BC have been discovered. In Schaarsbergen, twelve grave mounds were found from 2400 BC, which brought the so-called Neolithic Revolution to the area of Arnhem, which meant the rise of the farmers.\nThe earliest settlement in Arnhem dates from 1500 BC, of which traces have been found on the Hoogkamp, where the Van Goyenstraat is currently located. In the inner city, around the Sint-Jansbeek, traces of settlement have been found from around 700 BC, while the first traces south of the Rhine have been found dating to around 500 BC, in the \"Schuytgraaf\".\nThough the early tracks of settlements did show that the early residents of Arnhem descended from the forests on the hills, Arnhem was not built on the banks of the river Rhine, but a little higher along the Sint-Jansbeek. Arnhem arose on the location where the road between Nijmegen and Utrecht and Zutphen split. Seven streams provided the city with water, and only when the flow of the Rhine was changed in 1530, was the city located on the river.\nMiddle Ages.\nArnhem was first mentioned as such in 893 as \"Arneym\" or \"Arentheym\". In 1233, Count Otto II of Guelders from Zutphen, conferred city rights on the town, which had belonged to the abbey of Pr\u00fcm, settled in, and fortified it. Arnhem entered the Hanseatic League in 1443. In 1473, it was captured by Charles the Bold of Burgundy.\n16th and 17th century.\nIn 1514, Charles of Egmond, duke of Guelders, took it from the dukes of Burgundy; in 1543, it fell to the emperor Charles V. As capital of the so-called \"Kwartier van Veluwe\" it joined the Union of Utrecht during the Eighty Years' War in 1579. After its capture from the Spanish forces by Dutch and English troops in 1585 the city became part of the Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands. The French occupied the town from 1672 to 1674.\n18th and 19th century.\nFrom 1795 to 1813, it was reoccupied by the French, by both revolutionary and imperial forces.\nIn the early 19th century, the former fortifications were almost completely dismantled, to give space for town expansion. The \"Sabelspoort\" (Sabresgate) is the only remaining part of the medieval walls.\nIn the 19th century, Arnhem was a genteel resort town famous for its picturesque beauty. It was known as \"het Haagje van het oosten\" (The Little Hague of the East), mainly because a number of rich former sugar barons or planters from the Indies settled there, as they did in The Hague. Even now the city is famous for its parks and greenery. The urbanization in the north on hilly terrain is also quite unusual for the Netherlands.\n20th century.\nWorld War II.\nDuring the German occupation (World War II), the occupiers operated a subcamp of the Herzogenbusch concentration camp in the city.\nDuring Operation Market Garden (September 1944), the British 1st Airborne Division, under the command of Major-General Roy Urquhart, and the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade were given the task of securing the bridge at Arnhem.\nGlider infantry and paratrooper units were landed into the area on 17 September and later. The bulk of the force was dropped rather far from the bridge and never met their objective. A small element of the British 1st Airborne, the 2nd Parachute Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel John D. Frost, managed to make its way as far as the bridge but was unable to secure both sides. The British troops encountered stiff resistance from the German 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions, which had been stationed in and around the city.\nThe British force at the bridge eventually ran out of ammunition and was captured on 21 September, and a full withdrawal of the remaining forces was made on 26 September. These events were dramatized in the 1977 movie \"A Bridge Too Far\". (The bridge scenes in the movie were shot in Deventer, where a similar bridge over the IJssel was available, as the area around Arnhem bridge had changed too much to represent WWII-era Arnhem). As a tribute, the rebuilt bridge was renamed 'John Frost Bridge' after the commander of the paratroopers. The official commemoration is 17 September.\nThe current bridge is the third almost-identical bridge built at the same spot. The Dutch Army destroyed the first bridge when the German Army invaded the Netherlands in 1940. The second bridge was destroyed by the United States Army Air Forces shortly after the 1944 battle.\nA second battle of Arnhem took place in April 1945 when the city was liberated by the British 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division fighting as part of the First Canadian Army. The inhabitants of the city, who had been forcibly evacuated by the Germans during and after the battle, returned in the summer of 1945. The reconstruction of Arnhem took until 1969 to finally be completed.\nJust outside Arnhem, in the town of Oosterbeek the Commonwealth War Graves Commission built the Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery which contains the graves of most of those killed during the September landings, and many of those killed in later fighting in the area.\n1945\u20131999.\nArnhem hosted the 1980 Summer Paralympics.\n21st century.\nOn 6 March 2025, a major city fire broke out in Arnhem. The fire destroyed a block of shops and upstairs apartments in the historic city center.\nGeography.\nNeighbourhoods.\nThe municipality of Arnhem consists of the city of Arnhem and the following surrounding suburbs and former villages:\nArnhem consists of three districts (\"stadsdelen\") and 24 neighbourhoods (\"wijken\"). Each neighbourhood has a number which corresponds to its postal code.\nNeighbouring villages.\nThe outlying areas of the following villages are bordering the municipality of Arnhem directly, which means among others that in many a case a considerable number of their inhabitants originate from Arnhem.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProximity of border with Germany.\nThe city lies approximately 15 kilometers from the border with Germany, and to some extent the westernmost villages in the municipality of Elten, Germany, function as dormitories for people who work in the Dutch city of Arnhem in part due to the immigration of Dutch people from the region that were attracted by the lower house pricing just across the border.\nClimate.\nArnhem features the same climate (Cfb, oceanic climate) as all of the Netherlands; however, its location on the foothills of the Veluwe, the largest forest in the Netherlands, contributes to some higher precipitation values.\nPlaces of interest.\nThe \"Grote Kerk\" (St. Eusebius' Church), built 1452\u20131560, lost most of its tower during World War II, of which a part has been reconstructed to a modern design and opened in 1964. Officially the tower is not part of the church and is owned by the municipality.\nThe house of Maarten van Rossum, a general serving Duke Charles van Gelre, has been the town hall since 1830: The satyrs in its Renaissance ornamentation earned it the name \"Duivelshuis\" (devil's house). The Netherlands Open Air Museum is located outside the city. It includes antique houses, farms, factories, and windmills from different parts of the Netherlands. Two other windmills stand in Arnhem itself, De Hoop and De Kroon.\nThe Royal Burgers' Zoo in Arnhem is one of the biggest and most-visited zoos in the Netherlands, featuring an underwater walkthrough, desert, mangrove, and rainforest. The GelreDome, the home of Vitesse Arnhem, the city's Eredivisie team in football, is a unique facility that features a retractable roof and a slide-out grass pitch. The concept has been fully duplicated since then by the Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, and State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, U.S., and partially by the Sapporo Dome in Japan (which has a sliding pitch but a fixed roof).\nThe KEMA Toren (formerly known as \"SEP Control Tower\") is the highest structure of the town. It is a 140-m-high TV tower.\nSport.\nThe National Sports Centre Papendal is the national sports development centre of the Netherlands, located in Arnhem. The first event held at Papendal was the 1980 Summer Paralympics, from 21 June to 5 July. However the site was formally adopted and developed from 1993, after the merger of the Dutch National Olympic Committee (NOC) and the Nederlandse Sport Federatie (NSF).\nNOC*NSF have 90 affiliated national sports organizations, representing about 2700 individual sports clubs. Papendal is also the training location of football club Vitesse Arnhem, and the club's youth development system. Supporting facilities include a conference centre and hotel.\nIn preparation for the 2012 Summer Olympics, in 2011 the facility built a replica of the proposed BMX racing track at the London Velopark venue. The track will host the second event on the 2011 UCI BMX World Championships, on 27 and 28 May 2011.\nSince January 2013 Sports Centre Papendal officially split from NOC * NSF and thus as organization demerges. This split offers Sports Centre Papendal many commercial benefits. There are facilities for various sports, including athletics, cycling and more.\nSport in the city is principally focussed on its association football club Vitesse Arnhem and its stadium the GelreDome built for the UEFA Euro 2000. The club has enjoyed some success in the Eredivisie and has featured in the UEFA Cup competition. Their best result in the Eredivisie was third place in 1997\u201398. The club won the KNVB Cup in 2016\u201317.\nIntrodans is a dance company based in the city of Arnhem. In 2009 the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science designated Introdans part of the basic national infrastructure. In 2016 was the Giro d'Italia in Arnhem.\nTransport.\nDue to its central location in Eastern Netherlands, Arnhem is a hub for water, road, and rail traffic.\nArnhem is bikeable. The RijnWaalpad is a 17\u00a0km long bicycle highway and connects Arnhem with Nijmegen. It is the region's first fast-paced cycling route. In 2018 the second fast bike route was opened and Arnhem connects with Wageningen.\nArnhem has had a main central railway station since 1845 \u2013 Arnhem Centraal railway station, which is serviced by several intercity lines and the Intercity-Express to D\u00fcsseldorf and further on to Frankfurt.\nUntil 2016, there were also NS International trains to other destinations abroad, with some coaches going as far as Moscow.\nThe intercity lines provide direct connections to Utrecht, Nijmegen and Zutphen. It is also the terminus for several local railway services. Arnhem has three other stations, namely Arnhem Velperpoort (since 1953), Arnhem Presikhaaf (since 1969) and Arnhem Zuid (since 2005).\nKLM operates a bus from the train station to Schiphol Airport for its customers until April 2025.\nArnhem is unique in the Netherlands with its trolleybus system.\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nArnhem is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
