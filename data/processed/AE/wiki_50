{"id": "50620", "revid": "1311028209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50620", "title": "Scyphozoa", "text": "Class of marine cnidarians, true jellyfish\nThe Scyphozoa are an exclusively marine class of the phylum Cnidaria, referred to as the true jellyfish (or \"true jellies\").\nThe class name Scyphozoa comes from the Greek word \"skyphos\" (), denoting a kind of drinking cup and alluding to the cup shape of the organism.\nScyphozoans have existed from the earliest Cambrian to the present.\nBiology.\nMost species of Scyphozoa have two life-history phases, including the planktonic medusa or polyp form, which is most evident in the warm summer months, and an inconspicuous, but longer-lived, bottom-dwelling polyp, which seasonally gives rise to new medusae. Most of the large, often colorful, and conspicuous jellyfish found in coastal waters throughout the world are Scyphozoa. They typically range from in diameter, but the largest species, \"Cyanea capillata\" can reach across. Scyphomedusae are found throughout the world's oceans, from the surface to great depths; no Scyphozoa occur in freshwater (or on land).\nAs medusae, they eat a variety of crustaceans and fish, which they capture using stinging cells called nematocysts. The nematocysts are located throughout the tentacles that radiate downward from the edge of the umbrella dome, and also cover the four or eight oral arms that hang down from the central mouth. Some species, however, are instead filter feeders, using their tentacles to strain plankton from the water.\nAnatomy.\nScyphozoans usually display a four-part symmetry and have an internal gelatinous material called mesoglea, which provides the same structural integrity as a skeleton. The mesoglea includes mobile amoeboid cells originating from the epidermis.\nScyphozoans have no durable hard parts, including no head, no skeleton, and no specialized organs for respiration or excretion. Marine jellyfish can consist of as much as 98% water, so are rarely found in fossil form.\nUnlike the hydrozoan jellyfish, Hydromedusae, Scyphomedusae lack a vellum, which is a circular membrane beneath the umbrella that helps propel the (usually smaller) Hydromedusae through the water. However, a ring of muscle fibres is present within the mesoglea around the rim of the dome, and the jellyfish swims by alternately contracting and relaxing these muscles. The periodic contracting and relaxing propels the jellyfish through the water, allowing it to escape predation or catch its prey.\nThe mouth opens into a central stomach, from which four interconnected diverticula radiate outwards. In many species, this is further elaborated by a system of radial canals, with or without an additional ring canal towards the edge of the dome. Some genera, such as \"Cassiopea\", even have additional, smaller mouths in the oral arms. The lining of the digestive system includes further stinging nematocysts, along with cells that secrete digestive enzymes.\nThe nervous system usually consists of a distributed net of cells, although some species possess more organised nerve rings. In species lacking nerve rings, the nerve cells are instead concentrated into small structures called \"rhopalia\". There are between four and sixteen of these small lobes arranged around the rim of the umbrella, where they coordinate the muscular action allowing the animal to move. Each rhopalium is typically associated with a pair of sensory pits, a statocyst, and sometimes a pigment-cup ocellus.\nReproduction.\nMost species appear to be gonochorists, with separate male and female individuals. The gonads are located in the stomach lining, and the mature gametes are expelled through the mouth. After fertilization, some species brood their young in pouches on the oral arms, but they are more commonly planktonic.\nGrowth and development.\nThe fertilized egg produces a planular larva which, in most species, quickly attaches itself to the sea bottom. The larva develops into the hydroid stage of the lifecycle, a tiny sessile polyp called a scyphistoma. The scyphistoma reproduces asexually, producing similar polyps by budding, and then either transforming into a medusa, or budding several medusae off from its upper surface via a process called strobilation. The medusae are initially microscopic and may take years to reach sexual maturity.\nCommercial importance.\nScyphozoa include the moon jelly \"Aurelia aurita\", in the order Semaeostomeae, and the enormous \"Nemopilema nomurai\", in the order Rhizostomeae, found between Japan and China and which in some years causes major fisheries disruptions.\nThe jellyfish fished commercially for food are Scyphomedusae in the order Rhizostomeae. Most rhizostome jellyfish live in warm water.\nTaxonomy.\nAlthough the Scyphozoa were formerly considered to include the animals now referred to as the classes Cubozoa and Staurozoa, they now include just three extant orders (two of which are in Discomedusae, a subclass of Scyphozoa). About 200 extant species are recognized at present, but the true diversity is likely to be at least 400 species.\nClass Scyphozoa\n* Order Coronatae\n* Family Atollidae\n* Family Atorellidae\n* Family Linuchidae\n* Family Nausithoidae\n* Family Paraphyllinidae\n* Family Periphyllidae\n* Order Rhizostomeae\n* Suborder Daktyliophorae\n* Family Catostylidae\n* Family Lobonematidae\n* Family Lychnorhizidae\n* Family Rhizostomatidae\n* Family Stomolophidae\n* Suborder Kolpophorae\n* Family Cassiopeidae\n* Family Cepheidae\n* Family Mastigiidae\n* Family Thysanostomatidae\n* Family Versurigidae\n* Order Semaeostomeae\n* Family Cyaneidae\n* Family Drymonematidae\n* Family Pelagiidae\n* Family Phacellophoridae\n* Family Ulmaridae\n* Order \u2020Byroniida (possible stem coronatids)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50621", "revid": "45595768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50621", "title": "History of Cyprus", "text": "Human habitation of Cyprus dates back to the Paleolithic era. Cyprus's geographic position has caused the island to be influenced by differing Eastern Mediterranean civilisations over the millennia.\nPeriods of Cyprus's history from 1050 BC have been named according to styles of pottery found, as follows:\nPrehistoric Cyprus.\nPrior to the arrival of humans in Cyprus, only four terrestrial mammal species were present on the island, including the Cypriot pygmy hippopotamus and the Cyprus dwarf elephant, which were much smaller than their mainland ancestors as a result of insular dwarfism, with the other species being the Cypriot genet and the extant Cypriot mouse. The earliest humans to inhabit Cyprus were hunter gatherers who arrived on the island around 11,000\u201310,000 BC. The last records of the now extinct endemic mammals date to shortly after human settlement. The hunter gatherers later introduced wild boar to the island around 12,000 years ago, likely to act as a food source. The earliest presence of Neolithic farming settlements dates to around 8,500 BC.\nDogs, sheep, goats and possibly cattle were introduced, as well as numerous wild animals such as foxes and Persian fallow deer that were previously unknown on the island. The Pre-Pottery Neolithic B settlers built round houses with floors made of terrazzo of burned lime (e.g. Kastros, Shillourokambos) and cultivated einkorn and emmer. Pigs, sheep, goats and cattle were kept but remained, for the most part, behaviourally wild. Evidence of cattle such as was attested at Shillourokambos is rare, and when they apparently died out in the course of the 8th millennium BC they were not re-introduced until the Ceramic Neolithic.\nIn the 6th millennium BC, the aceramic Khirokitia culture was characterised by roundhouses, stone vessels and an economy based on sheep, goats and pigs. Cattle were unknown, and Persian fallow deer were hunted. This was followed by the ceramic Sotira phase. The Eneolithic era is characterised by stone figurines with spread arms.\nWater wells discovered by archaeologists in western Cyprus are believed to be among the oldest in the world, dated at 9,000 to 10,500 years old, putting them in the Stone Age. They are said to show the sophistication of early settlers, and their heightened appreciation for the environment.\nIn 2004, the remains of an 8-month-old cat were discovered buried with its human owner at a Neolithic archeological site in Cyprus. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, predating Egyptian civilization and significantly pushing back the earliest known feline-human association.\nBronze Age.\nIn the Bronze Age the first cities, such as Enkomi, were built in Alashiya (today Cyprus). Systematic copper mining began, and this resource was widely traded. Mycenaean Greeks were undoubtedly inhabiting Cyprus from the late stage of the Bronze Age while culturally destroying Alashiya, whereas the island's Greek name is already attested from the 15th century BC in the Linear B script.\nThe undeciphered Cypro-Minoan script was first used in early phases of the late Bronze Age (LCIB) and continued in use for around 500 years into the LC IIIB, maybe up to the second half of the eleventh century BC. It is not known if pre-Greek languages survived beyond the Bronze Age as Eteocypriot, or if this language was introduced by later eastern immigrants.\nThe LCIIC (1300\u20131200\u00a0BC) was a time of local prosperity. Cities such as Enkomi were rebuilt on a rectangular grid plan, where the town gates correspond to the grid axes and numerous grand buildings front the street system or newly founded. Great official buildings constructed from ashlar masonry point to increased social hierarchisation and control. Some of these buildings contain facilities for processing and storing olive oil, such as Maroni-Vournes and Building X at Kalavassos-Ayios Dhimitrios. A sanctuary with a horned altar constructed from ashlar has been found at Myrtou-Pigadhes, other temples have been located at Enkomi, Kition and Kouklia (Palaepaphos). Both the regular layout of the cities and the new masonry techniques find their closest parallels in Syria, especially in Ugarit. Rectangular corbelled tombs point to close contacts with Syria and Canaan.\nThe practice of writing spread and tablets in the Cypro-Minoan script have been found at Ugarit. Ugaritic texts from Ugarit and Enkomi mention Ya, the Assyrian name of Cyprus, that thus seems to have been in use already in the late Bronze Age.\nCopper ingots shaped like oxhides have been recovered from shipwrecks such as at Uluburun, Iria and Cape Gelidonya, which attest to the widespread metal trade. Weights in the shape of animals found in Enkomi and Kalavassos follow the Syro-Palestinian, Mesopotamian, Hittite and Aegean standards and thus attest to the wide-ranging trade as well.\nLate Bronze Age Cyprus was a part of the Hittite Empire, but was a client state and as such was not invaded, but rather part of the empire by association and governed by the ruling kings of Ugarit. As such Cyprus was essentially \"left alone with little intervention in Cypriot affairs\".\nAlthough Achaean Greeks were living in Cyprus from the 14th century, most of them inhabited the island after the Trojan War. Greeks were colonizing Cyprus from 1210 to 1000\u00a0BC. Dorian Greeks arrived around 1100\u00a0BC and, unlike the pattern on the Greek mainland, the evidence suggests that they settled on Cyprus peacefully.\nAnother wave of Greek settlement is believed to have taken place in the following century (LCIIIB, 1100\u20131050), indicated, among other things, by a new type of graves (long dromoi) and Mycenaean influences in pottery decoration.\nAlashiya.\nAlashiya, the Bronze Age Eastern Mediterranean state that was the major source of copper in the region, was likely situated in Cyprus or includes parts of Cyprus.\nCorrespondences between the King of Alashiya and Egyptian administration could be found in the Amarna letters, while the Ugaritic texts contains exchanges between the King of Alashiya and the King of Ugarit.\nIn the second half of the 13th century BC, the current town of Enkomi \u2013 if it can be identified with Alashiya \u2013 was conquered and destroyed twice. The first destruction may have coincided with the historically documented conquest of Alashiya by the Hittite king Tud\u1e2balija IV. The second destruction took place around 1220 BC, apparently by members of the Mycenaean Greek culture, who rebuilt the city in a chessboard fashion. Around 1050 BC Enkomi was destroyed again by an earthquake.\nPottery.\nIn the later phase of the Late Bronze Age (LCIIIA, 1200\u20131100\u00a0BC) great amounts of 'Mycenaean' IIIC:1b pottery were produced locally. New architectural features include cyclopean walls, found on the Greek mainland, as well and a certain type of rectangular stepped capitals, endemic to Cyprus. Chamber tombs are given up in favour of shaft graves. Large amounts of IIIC:1b pottery are found in Palestine during this period as well. While this was formerly interpreted as evidence of an invasion (Sea Peoples), this is seen more and more as an indigenous development, triggered by increasing trade relations with Cyprus and Crete. Evidence of early trade with Crete is found in archaeological recovery on Cyprus of pottery from Kydonia, a powerful urban center of ancient Crete.\nCypriot city kingdoms.\nMost authors claim that the Cypriot city kingdoms, first described in written sources in the 8th century BC were already founded in the 11th century BC. Other scholars see a slow process of increasing social complexity between the 12th and the 8th centuries, based on a network of chiefdoms. In the 8th century (geometric period) the number of settlements increases sharply and monumental tombs, like the 'royal' tombs of Salamis appear for the first time. This could be a better indication for the appearance of the Cypriot kingdoms.\nEarly Iron Age.\nThe early Iron Age on Cyprus follows the Submycenaean period (1125\u20131050\u00a0BC) of the Late Bronze Age. It is divided into the Geometric (1050\u2013700 BC) and Archaic (700\u2013525 BC) periods.\nFoundations myths documented by classical authors connect the foundation of numerous Cypriot towns with immigrant Greek heroes in the wake of the Trojan War. For example, Teucer, brother of Aias was supposed to have founded Salamis, and the Arcadian Agapenor of Tegea to have replaced the native ruler Kinyras and to have founded Paphos. Some scholars see this a memory of a Greek colonisation already in the 11th\u00a0century BC. Tomb 49 from the 11th century BC was found in Palaepaphos-Skales, containing three bronze obeloi with inscriptions in Cypriot syllabic script, one of which bears the name of Opheltas. This is the first indication of the use of Greek language on the island.\nCremation as a burial rite is seen as a Greek introduction as well. The first cremation burial in bronze vessels has been found at Kourion-Kaloriziki, tomb 40, dated to the first half of the 11th century BC (LCIIIB). The shaft grave contained two bronze rod tripod stands, the remains of a shield and a golden sceptre as well. Formerly seen as the royal grave of first Argive founders of Kourion, it is now interpreted as the tomb of a native Cypriot or a Phoenician prince. The cloisonn\u00e9 enamelling of the sceptre head with the two falcons surmounting it has no parallels in the Aegean, but shows a strong Egyptian influence.\nA population living in Amathus in the early Iron Age left inscriptions in the Eteocypriot language using the Cypriot syllabary. It is not known if this language survived from a Bronze Age language spoken in Cyprus, maybe one written in the Cypro-Minoan script, or if it was related to Hurrian, since later eastern immigrants may have adopted the script, similar to how the Mycenaeans adopted the Minoan script.\nPhoenicians.\nLiterary evidence suggests an early Phoenician presence at Kition which was under Tyrian rule at the beginning of the 10th century BC. Some Phoenician merchants who were believed to come from Tyre colonized the area and expanded the political influence of Kition. After c.\u2009850 BC the sanctuaries [at the Kathari site] were rebuilt and reused by the Phoenicians. The oldest cemetery of Salamis has produced children's burials in Canaanite jars, indication of Phoenician presence already in the 11th\u00a0century BC (LCIIIB). Similar jar burials have been found in cemeteries in Kourion-Kaloriziki and Palaepaphos-Skales near Kouklia. In Skales, many Levantine imports and Cypriot imitations of Levantine forms have been found and point to a Phoenician expansion even before the end of the 11th century BC.\nAncient Cyprus.\nThe Assyrians rediscovered Cyprus in the late eighth century BCE, yet they did not establish lasting territorial control over the island. The Assyrian name for Cyprus, Iadnana, likely designated it as the \"island of the Danunians,\" although its exact origins remain uncertain. A stela found 1845 in Kition commemorates the victory of king Sargon II (721\u2013705\u00a0BC) in 709 over the seven kings in the land of Ia', in the district of Iadnana or Atnana. There are other inscriptions referring to Ia' in Sargon's palace at Khorsabad. The ten kingdoms listed by an inscription of Esarhaddon in 673/2\u00a0BC have been identified as Salamis, Kition, Amathus, Kourion, Paphos and Soli on the coast and Tamassos, Ledra, Idalium and Chytri in the interior.Cyprus gained independence for some time around 669 but was conquered by Egypt under Amasis (570\u2013526/525). The island was conquered by the Persians around 545\u00a0BC. A Persian palace has been excavated in the territory of Marion on the North coast near Soli. The inhabitants took part in the Ionian rising. At the beginning of the 4th century BC, Euagoras I, King of Salamis, took control of the whole island and tried to gain independence from Persia. Another uprising took place in 350 but was crushed by Artaxerxes in 344.\nDuring the siege of Tyre, the Cypriot Kings went over to Alexander the Great. In 321 four Cypriot kings sided with Ptolemy I and defended the island against Antigonos. Ptolemy lost Cyprus to Demetrios Poliorketes between 306 and 295\u00a0BC, but after that it remained under Ptolemaic rule till 58\u00a0BC. It was ruled by a governor from Egypt and sometimes formed a minor Ptolemaic kingdom during the power-struggles of the 2nd and 1st centuries. Strong commercial relationships with Athens and Alexandria, two of the most important commercial centres of antiquity, developed.\nFull Hellenisation only took place under Ptolemaic rule. Phoenician traits disappeared, together with the old Cypriot syllabic script. A number of cities were founded during this time, e.g. Arsinoe that was founded between old and new Paphos by Ptolemy II.\nCyprus became a Roman province in 58\u00a0BC, according to Strabo because the Roman politician, Publius Clodius Pulcher, held a grudge against the king of Cyprus, Ptolemy, and sent Marcus Cato to conquer the island after he had become tribune. Mark Antony gave the island to Cleopatra VII of Egypt and her sister Arsinoe IV, but it became a Roman province again after his defeat at the Battle of Actium (31\u00a0BC) in 30\u00a0BC. From 22\u00a0BC it was a senatorial province. The island suffered great losses during the Jewish uprising of 115/116\u00a0AD.\nAfter the reforms of Diocletian it was placed under the control of the Consularis Oriens and governed by a proconsul. Several earthquakes led to the destruction of Salamis at the beginning of the 4th century, at the same time drought and famine hit the island.\nMedieval Cyprus.\nAfter the division of the Roman Empire into an eastern half and a western half, Cyprus came under the rule of the Eastern Roman Empire. At that time, its bishop, while still subject to the Christian Church, was made autocephalous by the First Council of Ephesus in 431.\nThe Arab Muslims invaded Cyprus in force in the 650s, but in 688, the Byzantine emperor Justinian II and the Umayyad caliph \u02bfAbd al-Malik ibn Marw\u0101n reached an unprecedented agreement. For the next 300 years, Cyprus was ruled jointly by both the Arabs and the Byzantines as a \"condominium\", despite the nearly constant warfare between the two parties on the mainland. The Byzantines recovered control over the island for short periods thereafter, but the \"status quo\" was always restored.\nThis period lasted until the year 965, when Niketas Chalkoutzes conquered the island for a resurgent Byzantium. In 1185, the last Byzantine governor of Cyprus, Isaac Comnenus of Cyprus from a minor line of the Imperial house, rose in rebellion, and attempted to seize the throne. His attempted coup was unsuccessful, but Comnenus was able to retain control of the island. Byzantine actions against Comnenus failed because he enjoyed the support of William II of Sicily. The Byzantine emperor had an agreement with the sultan of Egypt to close Cypriot harbours to the Crusaders.\nThe Third Crusade.\nDuring the Third Crusade, the island of Cyprus became a target of the Crusaders in the late 12th century. Richard the Lionheart landed in Limassol on 1 June 1191 in search of his sister and his bride Berengaria, whose ship had become separated from the fleet in a storm. Richard's army landed when Isaac refused to return the hostages (Richard's sister, his bride, and several shipwrecked soldiers), and forced Isaac to flee from Limassol. He eventually surrendered, conceding control of the island to the King of England. Richard married Berengaria in Limassol on 12 May 1192; she was crowned as Queen of England by John Fitzluke, Bishop of \u00c9vreux. The Crusader fleet continued to St. Jean d'Acre on 5 June of the same year.\nThe army of Richard the Lionheart continued to occupy Cyprus and raised taxes. He sold the island to the Knights Templar. Soon after that, the French army under the House of Lusignan occupied the island, establishing the Kingdom of Cyprus in 1192. They declared Latin as the official language, later replacing it with French; much later, Greek was recognized as a second official language. In 1196, dioceses of the Latin Church were established on the island, and the Greek Orthodox Cypriot Church experienced a series of religious persecutions perpetrated by the Latin Catholics. Maronites settled on Cyprus during the Crusades and still maintain some villages in the North.\nKingdom of Cyprus.\nAmalric I of Cyprus (Aimery de Lusignan) received the royal crown and title from Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor. A small minority Roman Catholic population of the island was mainly confined to some coastal cities, such as Famagusta, as well as inland Nicosia, the traditional capital. Roman Catholics kept the reins of power and control, while the Greek inhabitants lived in the countryside; this was much the same as the arrangement in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The independent Eastern Orthodox Church of Cyprus, with its own archbishop and subject to no patriarch, was allowed to remain on the island, but the Latin Church largely displaced it in stature and holding property.\nAfter the death of Amalric of Lusignan, the Kingdom continually passed to a series of young boys who grew up as king. The Ibelin family, which had held much power in Jerusalem prior its downfall, acted as regents during these early years. In 1229 one of the Ibelin regents was forced out of power by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, who brought the struggle between the Guelphs and Ghibellines to the island.\nFrederick's supporters were defeated in this struggle by 1233, although it lasted longer in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and in the Holy Roman Empire. Frederick's Hohenstaufen descendants continued to rule as kings of Jerusalem until 1268 when Hugh III of Cyprus (d.1284) of the Lusignan family claimed the title and its territory of Acre for himself upon the death of Conrad III of Jerusalem, thus uniting the two kingdoms. The territory in Palestine was finally lost while Henry II was king in 1291, but the kings of Cyprus continued to claim the title.\nLike Jerusalem, Cyprus had an Haute Cour (High Court), although it was less powerful than it had been in Jerusalem. The island was richer and more feudal than Jerusalem, so the king had more personal wealth and could afford to ignore the Haute Cour. The most important vassal family was the multi-branch House of Ibelin. However, the king was often in conflict with the Italian merchants, especially because Cyprus had become the centre of European trade with Africa and Asia after the fall of Acre in 1291.\nThe kingdom eventually came to be dominated more and more in the 14th century by the Genoese merchants. Cyprus therefore sided with the Avignon Papacy in the Western Schism, in the hope that the French would be able to drive out the Italians. The Mameluks then made the kingdom a tributary state in 1426; the remaining monarchs gradually lost almost all independence, until 1489 when the last Queen, Catherine Cornaro, was forced to sell the island to Venice. Ottomans started raiding Cyprus immediately afterwards, and captured it in 1571.\nThis is the historical setting to Shakespeare's \"Othello\", the play's title character being the commander of the Venetian garrison defending Cyprus against the Ottomans.\nOttoman Cyprus.\nCyprus 1571.\nIn 1571, Cyprus became an Eyalet, a province, of the Ottoman Empire until 1878. In 1571, the Turks entered the country in order of the Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1570\u20131573), also known as the Fourth Ottoman - Venetian War, or the War of Cyprus. Following the Ottoman Empire's invasion of Cyprus with 350-400 ships and 60,000-100,000 soldiers to take control of the island, Turks and Cypriots coexisted on the island. Cyprus was rich in salt, sugar, cotton, grains, and other import and export goods at that time, in addition it was also a transfer country for the Syria-Venice trade. As a result, Cyprus served as the eastern Mediterranean's main emporium for Venice's maritime trade.\nAfter the Venetians lost control and the Ottomans gained control over Cyprus, Venice continued to use Cyprus for trading. Merchants that were imprisoned during the war were released and had their goods and ships returned to them. The trade continued and was only interrupted during wars. There were also Venetian consuls present in Cyprus to stabilize trade and protect the traders. The government of Cyprus used to borrow money from Venician merchants in the early 16th century. Until the end of Ottoman rule on Cyprus, the trade continued with being held during the times of war.\nReligion and culture under Ottoman leadership.\nThe Ottoman Empire was predominantly Muslim. Therefore, there was a cultural and religious clash when it conquered Cyprus. As Cyprus became a territory of the Ottoman Empire, more Muslims came to Cyprus mixing in with the Orthodox Christian Greek population of the island. That's why the Millet System was introduced in Cyprus, it allowed authorities to rule over their religious minorities to keep peace in the Country. The Ottoman Empire still tried to spread the Muslim culture in Cyprus. That especially concerned women as by Islam they had to cover their heads and most women at the time obeyed that rule.\nChange of Administration of Cyprus.\nSince 1670, the Ottomans have shifted their governance of Cyprus and its significance multiple times. From a sanjak (sub-province) to a Grand Vizer's fief, to an eyalet, back to a fief, and finally back to a sanjak.\nCyprus 1878 (Russo-Turkish War).\nDuring the Russo-Turkish War in the Mediterranean Cyprus prepared for the invasion which occurred and left the population with financial issues for the decades to come. The Russians had been spreading propaganda in the Mediterranean which called upon Orthodox Greek Christians to fight against the Ottoman Empire. Cyprus was trying to balance between supporting the Ottoman Empire with grain but on the other hand they tried not to oppose Russia.\nThe Russo-Turkish War ended the Ottoman control of Cyprus in 1878. Cyprus then came under the control of the British Empire with its conditions set out in the Cyprus Convention between the United Kingdom and Ottoman Empire. However, the sovereignty of the island continued to be maintained by the Ottoman Empire until Great Britain annexed the island unilaterally in 1914, after it declared war against the Ottomans during the First World War. Following World War I, under the provisions of the Lausanne Treaty, Turkey relinquished all claims and rights on Cyprus.\nUnder British rule, the island began to enjoy a period of increased freedom of speech, something which allowed further development of the Greek Cypriots' ideas of \"enosis\" (unification with Greece).\nModern Cyprus.\nIn 1878, as the result of the Cyprus Convention, the United Kingdom took over the government of Cyprus as a protectorate from the Ottoman Empire. In 1914, at the beginning of World War I, the Ottomans declared war on Britain, leading to the British annexation of Cyprus.\nThe island's population welcomed the arrival of the British in 1878, as it meant the end of the long Turkish occupation, on one hand, but also because (bearing in mind the example of the Ionian islands) it was believed to be a necessary transitional stage for the final purpose, which was the return of Cyprus to Greece. In the 1920s, the political leaders of the Cypriot Greeks decided to adopt a change of tactics in their pursuit for enosis\u2014the union of Cyprus with Greece. Instead of the uncompromising course for \"union and only union\", it was decided that, under the circumstances, some civil liberties could be negotiated and won in favor of the Cypriot people. In 1921, the Political Organization of Cyprus was formed to serve that purpose, but was dissolved later that decade.\nGreek Cypriot representatives were repeatedly sent to England over the years to formally set the request to the colonial metropolis, but to no avail whatsoever. The participation of Greek Cypriots in the national struggles of the Greeks (such as in the wars at the end of the 19th century and in the Balkan wars of 1912\u201313) was an expression of their belief in the common origin of Greeks and Cypriots, in a common fate and a common path. The participation of Greek Cypriot volunteers in the First World War was an expression of the belief that there would be a \"Cypriot share\" in the \"distribution of profits\" after the victory (something that also happened later, during the Second World War). Besides, the Greek Prime Minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, had negotiated the handing over of Cyprus to Greece, in the years leading to the First World War. However, during the \"distribution of profits\" at the Paris conference after the First World War, there was no \"Cypriot share\" despite the Greek Cypriot leadership's presence and efforts. After the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), by which Turkey renounced all its rights over Cyprus, some new hopes were born because a very serious obstacle to the return of Cyprus to Greece was removed. However, in 1925, following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, and with the removal of this obstacle, England proceeded not to cede Cyprus to Greece but to annex it by declaring the island a Crown Colony. It had then become absolutely clear to the Greek Cypriots, from English officials (such as the Colonial Secretary Leo Amery) that unification was out of the question, and that this subject was definitively closed, rebutting the hopes and expectations of the Greek Cypriots for achieving their ideal.\nThe National Organization of Cyprus (EOK; not to be confused with EOKA), that was founded in 1930 by church circles and whose members were chosen by the Archbishop, played a role in strengthening the demand of enosis. Its purpose was the pursuit of this goal and the rejection of the Autonomy proposed by the English. In 1931, the even more hardline National Radical Union of the Center (\u0395R\u0395\u039a) was founded whose members were secret. The repetitive rebuttal of the Greek Cypriots' hopes, along with other political events at the time, triggered the great uprising of October 1931, known as the October riots. Cyprus thus entered a period of autocratic rule known as \"Palmerokratia\" (\"Palmerocracy\"), named after governor Richmond Palmer, which started shortly before the revolt and would last until the beginning of World War II.\nIn January 1950, the Orthodox Church of Cyprus organized the Union Referendum (referendum about Enosis), in which Greek Cypriots, which constituted around 80% of the population at the time, were called to vote, and ended in strong favor for the movement. However, their shout fell on deaf ears since the international community showed no desire to support their request Between 1955 and 1959 Greek Cypriots formed the EOKA organisation, led by George Grivas, and began the liberation struggle with ultimate goal being enosis. However the EOKA campaign did not result in union with Greece but rather in an independent republic, the Republic of Cyprus, in 1960.\nThe 1960 constitution put in place a form of power-sharing, or consociational government, in which concessions were made to the Turkish Cypriots minority, including as a requirement that the vice-president of Cyprus and at least 30% of members of parliament be Turkish Cypriots. Archbishop Makarios III would be the President and Dr. Faz\u0131l K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck would become vice president. One of the articles in the constitution was the creation of separate local municipalities so that Greek and Turkish Cypriots could manage their own municipalities in large towns.\nInternal conflicts turned into full-fledged armed fighting between the two communities on the island which prompted the United Nations to send peacekeeping forces in 1964; these forces are still in place today. In 1974, Greek nationalists performed a military coup with the support of the military junta in Greece. Unable to secure multilateral support against the coup, Turkey invaded the northern portion of the island. Turkish forces remained after a cease-fire, resulting in the partition of the island. The intercommunal violence, the coup, and the subsequent invasion led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Cypriots.\nThe \"de facto\" state of Northern Cyprus was proclaimed in 1975 under the name of the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus. The name was changed to its present form, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, on 15 November 1983. Recognised only by Turkey, Northern Cyprus is considered by the international community to be part of the Republic of Cyprus.\nIn 2002 UN Secretary General Kofi Annan started a new round of negotiations for the unification of the island. In 2004 after long negotiations between both sides a plan for unification of the island emerged. The resulting plan was supported by United Nations, European Union and the United States. The nationalists on both sides campaigned for the rejection of the plan, the result being that Turkish Cypriots accepted the plan while Greek Cypriots rejected it overwhelmingly.\nAfter Cyprus became a member of the European Union in 2004, it adopted the euro as its currency on January 1, 2008, replacing the previously used Cypriot pound; Northern Cyprus continued to use the Turkish lira.\nThe political environment is dominated by the communist AKEL, the liberal conservative Democratic Rally, the centrist Democratic Party and the social-democratic EDEK.\nIn 2008, Dimitris Christofias became the country's first Communist head of state. Due to his involvement in the 2012\u201313 Cypriot financial crisis, Christofias did not run for re-election in 2013. The Presidential election in 2013 resulted in Democratic Rally candidate Nicos Anastasiades winning 57.48% of the vote. As a result, Anastasiades was sworn in on 28 February 2013. Anastasiades was re-elected with 56% of the vote in the 2018 presidential election. On 28 February 2023, Nikos Christodoulides, the winner of the 2023 presidential election run-off, was sworn in as the eighth president of the Republic of Cyprus.\nSee also.\nGeneral:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Enkomi Alasia in Cyprus.

The name is short for change mod\"'e\" where \"mode\" refers to the permissions and flags collectively.\nThe command originated in AT&amp;T Unix version 1 and was exclusive to Unix and Unix-like operating systems until it was ported to other operating systems such as Windows (in UnxUtils) and IBM i.\nIn Unix and Unix-like operating systems, a system call with the same name as the command, chmod(), provides access to the underlying access control data. The command exposes the capabilities of the system call to a shell user.\nAs the need for enhanced file-system permissions grew, access-control lists were added to many file systems to augment the modes controlled via .\nThe implementation of bundled in GNU coreutils was written by David MacKenzie and Jim Meyering. \nUse.\nAlthough the syntax of the command varies somewhat by implementation, it generally accepts either a single octal value (which specifies \"all\" the mode bits on each file), or a comma-delimited list of symbolic specifiers (which describes how to change the existing mode bits of each file). The remaining arguments are a list of paths to files to be modified.\nChanging permissions is only allowed for the superuser (root) and the owner of a file. \nIf a symbolic link is specified, the target of the link has its mode bits adjusted. Permissions directly associated with a symbolic link file system entry are typically not used.\nOptions.\nOptional, command-line options may include:\nOctal notation.\nGiven a numeric permissions argument, the command treats it as an octal number, and replaces \"all\" the mode bits for each file. (Although four digits are specified, leading digits can be elided.)\nThere are twelve standard mode bits, comprising three special bits (setuid, setgid, and sticky), and three permission groups (controlling access by \"user\", \"group\", and \"other\") of 3 bits each (\"read\", \"write\", and \"exec/scan\"); each permission bit grants access if set (1) or denies access if clear (0).\nAs an octal digit represents a 3-bit value, the twelve mode bits can be represented as four octal digits. accepts up to four digits and uses 0 for left digits not specified (as is normal for numeric representation). In practice, three digits are commonly specified since the special modes are rarely used and the user class is usually specified. \nIn the context of an octal digit, each operation bit represents a numeric value: read: 4, write: 2 and execute: 1. The following table relates octal digit values to a class operations value.\nThe command can report a file's permissions as octal. For example:\n$ stat -c %a findPhoneNumbers.sh\n754\nThe reported value, indicates the following permissions:\nA code permits execution if and only if it is odd (i.e. 1, 3, 5, or 7). A code permits read if and only if it is greater than or equal to 4 (i.e. 4, 5, 6, or 7). A code permits write if and only if it is 2, 3, 6, or 7.\nSymbolic notation.\nThe command accepts symbolic notation that specifies how to modify the existing permissions. The command accepts a comma-separate list of specifiers like: codice_1\nClasses map permissions to users. A change specifier can select one class by including its symbol, multiple by including each class's symbol with no delimiter or if not specified, then all classes are selected and further the bits of umask mask will be unchanged. Class specifiers include:\nAs ownership is key to access control, and since the symbolic specification uses the abbreviation \"o\", some incorrectly think that it means \"owner\", when, in fact, it is short for \"others\".\nThe change operators include:\nOperations can be specified as follows:\nMost implementations support the specification of the special modes in octal, but some do not which requires using the symbolic notation.\nThe command can report file permissions in a symbolic notation that is similar to the notation used with . reports permissions in a notation that consists of 10 letters. The first indicates the type of the file system entry, such as dash for regular file and 'd' for directory. Following that are three sets of three letters that indicate read, write and execute permissions grouped by user, group and others classes. Each position is either dash to indicate lack of permission or the single-letter abbreviation for the permission to indicate that it's granted. For example:\n$ ls -l findPhoneNumbers.sh\n-rwxr-xr-- 1 dgerman staff 823 Dec 16 15:03 findPhoneNumbers.sh\nThe permission specifier starts with a dash which indicates that is a regular file; not a directory. The next three letters indicate that the file can be read, written, and executed by the owning user . The next three letters indicate that the file can be read and executed by members of the group. And the last three letters indicate that the file is read-only for other users.\nExamples.\nAdd write permission to the group class of a directory, allowing users in the same group to add files:\n$ ls -ld dir # before\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 jsmitt northregion 96 Apr 8 12:53 shared_dir\n$ chmod g+w dir\n$ ls -ld dir # after\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 jsmitt northregion 96 Apr 8 12:53 shared_dir\nRemove write permission for all classes, preventing anyone from writing to the file:\n$ ls -l ourBestReferenceFile\n-rw-rw-r-- 2 tmiller northregion 96 Apr 8 12:53 ourBestReferenceFile\n$ chmod a-w ourBestReferenceFile\n$ ls -l ourBestReferenceFile\n-r--r--r-- 2 tmiller northregion 96 Apr 8 12:53 ourBestReferenceFile\nSet the permissions for the user and group classes to read and execute only; no write permission; preventing anyone from adding files:\n$ ls -ld referenceLib\ndrwxr----- 2 ebowman northregion 96 Apr 8 12:53 referenceLib\n$ chmod ug=rx referenceLib\n$ ls -ld referenceLib\ndr-xr-x--- 2 ebowman northregion 96 Apr 8 12:53 referenceLib\nEnable write for the user class while making it read-only for group and others:\n$ chmod u=rw,go=r sample\n$ ls -ld sample\ndrw-r--r-- 2 oschultz warehousing 96 Dec 8 12:53 sample\nTo recursively set access for the directory docs/ and its contained files:\ncodice_2\nTo set user and group for read and write only and set others for read only:\ncodice_3\nTo set user for read, write, and execute only and group and others for read only:\ncodice_4\nTo set the sticky bit in addition to user, group and others permissions:\ncodice_5\nTo set UID in addition to user, group and others permissions:\ncodice_6\nTo set GID in addition to user, group and others permissions:\ncodice_7\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A function formula_4 is called conformal (or angle-preserving) at a point formula_5 if it preserves angles between directed curves through formula_6, as well as preserving orientation. Conformal maps preserve both angles and the shapes of infinitesimally small figures, but not necessarily their size or curvature.\nThe conformal property may be described in terms of the Jacobian derivative matrix of a coordinate transformation. The transformation is conformal whenever the Jacobian at each point is a positive scalar times a rotation matrix (orthogonal with determinant one). Some authors define conformality to include orientation-reversing mappings whose Jacobians can be written as any scalar times any orthogonal matrix.\nFor mappings in two dimensions, the (orientation-preserving) conformal mappings are precisely the locally invertible complex analytic functions. In three and higher dimensions, Liouville's theorem sharply limits the conformal mappings to a few types.\nThe notion of conformality generalizes in a natural way to maps between Riemannian or semi-Riemannian manifolds.\nIn two dimensions.\nIf formula_1 is an open subset of the complex plane formula_8, then a function formula_9 is conformal if and only if it is holomorphic and its derivative is everywhere non-zero on formula_1. If formula_11 is antiholomorphic (complex conjugate to a holomorphic function), it preserves angles but reverses their orientation.\nIn the literature, there is another definition of conformal: a mapping formula_11 which is one-to-one and holomorphic on an open set in the plane. The open mapping theorem forces the inverse function (defined on the image of formula_11) to be holomorphic. Thus, under this definition, a map is conformal if and only if it is biholomorphic. The two definitions for conformal maps are not equivalent. Being one-to-one and holomorphic implies having a non-zero derivative. In fact, we have the following relation, the inverse function theorem:\nformula_14\nwhere formula_15. However, the exponential function is a holomorphic function with a nonzero derivative, but is not one-to-one since it is periodic.\nThe Riemann mapping theorem, one of the profound results of complex analysis, states that any non-empty open simply connected proper subset of formula_8 admits a bijective conformal map to the open unit disk in formula_8. Informally, this means that any blob can be transformed into a perfect circle by some conformal map.\nGlobal conformal maps on the Riemann sphere.\nA map of the Riemann sphere onto itself is conformal if and only if it is a M\u00f6bius transformation.\nThe complex conjugate of a M\u00f6bius transformation preserves angles, but reverses the orientation. For example, circle inversions.\nConformality with respect to three types of angles.\nIn plane geometry there are three types of angles that may be preserved in a conformal map. Each is hosted by its own real algebra, ordinary complex numbers, split-complex numbers, and dual numbers. The conformal maps are described by linear fractional transformations in each case.\nIn three or more dimensions.\nRiemannian geometry.\nIn Riemannian geometry, two Riemannian metrics formula_18 and formula_19 on a smooth manifold formula_20 are called conformally equivalent if formula_21 for some positive function formula_22 on formula_20. The function formula_24 is called the conformal factor.\nA diffeomorphism between two Riemannian manifolds is called a conformal map if the pulled back metric is conformally equivalent to the original one. For example, stereographic projection of a sphere onto the plane augmented with a point at infinity is a conformal map.\nOne can also define a conformal structure on a smooth manifold, as a class of conformally equivalent Riemannian metrics.\nEuclidean space.\nA classical theorem of Joseph Liouville shows that there are far fewer conformal maps in higher dimensions than in two dimensions. Any conformal map from an open subset of Euclidean space into the same Euclidean space of dimension three or greater can be composed from three types of transformations: a homothety, an isometry, and a special conformal transformation. For linear transformations, a conformal map may only be composed of homothety and isometry, and is called a conformal linear transformation.\nApplications.\nApplications of conformal mapping exist\nin aerospace engineering, \nin biomedical sciences \n(including brain mapping\nand genetic mapping),\nin applied math\n(for geodesics \nand in geometry),\nin earth sciences\n(including geophysics,\ngeography,\nand cartography),\nin engineering, \nand in electronics.\nCartography.\nIn cartography, several named map projections, including the Mercator projection and the stereographic projection are conformal. The preservation of compass directions makes them useful in marine navigation.\nPhysics and engineering.\nConformal mappings are invaluable for solving problems in engineering and physics that can be expressed in terms of functions of a complex variable yet exhibit inconvenient geometries. By choosing an appropriate mapping, the analyst can transform the inconvenient geometry into a much more convenient one. For example, one may wish to calculate the electric field, formula_25, arising from a point charge located near the corner of two conducting planes separated by a certain angle (where formula_26 is the complex coordinate of a point in 2-space). This problem \"per se\" is quite clumsy to solve in closed form. However, by employing a very simple conformal mapping, the inconvenient angle is mapped to one of precisely formula_27 radians, meaning that the corner of two planes is transformed to a straight line. In this new domain, the problem (that of calculating the electric field impressed by a point charge located near a conducting wall) is quite easy to solve. The solution is obtained in this domain, formula_28, and then mapped back to the original domain by noting that formula_29 was obtained as a function (\"viz\"., the composition of formula_30 and formula_29) of formula_26, whence formula_28 can be viewed as formula_34, which is a function of formula_26, the original coordinate basis. Note that this application is not a contradiction to the fact that conformal mappings preserve angles, they do so only for points in the interior of their domain, and not at the boundary. Another example is the application of conformal mapping technique for solving the boundary value problem of liquid sloshing in tanks.\nIf a function is harmonic (that is, it satisfies Laplace's equation formula_36) over a plane domain (which is two-dimensional), and is transformed via a conformal map to another plane domain, the transformation is also harmonic. For this reason, any function which is defined by a potential can be transformed by a conformal map and still remain governed by a potential. Examples in physics of equations defined by a potential include the electromagnetic field, the gravitational field, and, in fluid dynamics, potential flow, which is an approximation to fluid flow assuming constant density, zero viscosity, and irrotational flow. One example of a fluid dynamic application of a conformal map is the Joukowsky transform that can be used to examine the field of flow around a Joukowsky airfoil.\nConformal maps are also valuable in solving nonlinear partial differential equations in some specific geometries. Such analytic solutions provide a useful check on the accuracy of numerical simulations of the governing equation. For example, in the case of very viscous free-surface flow around a semi-infinite wall, the domain can be mapped to a half-plane in which the solution is one-dimensional and straightforward to calculate.\nFor discrete systems, Noury and Yang presented a way to convert discrete systems root locus into continuous root locus through a well-known conformal mapping in geometry (aka inversion mapping).\nMaxwell's equations.\nMaxwell's equations are preserved by Lorentz transformations which form a group including circular and hyperbolic rotations. The latter are sometimes called Lorentz boosts to distinguish them from circular rotations. All these transformations are conformal since hyperbolic rotations preserve hyperbolic angle, (called rapidity) and the other rotations preserve circular angle. The introduction of translations in the Poincar\u00e9 group again preserves angles. \nA larger group of conformal maps for relating solutions of Maxwell's equations was identified by Ebenezer Cunningham (1908) and Harry Bateman (1910). Their training at Cambridge University had given them facility with the method of image charges and associated methods of images for spheres and inversion. As recounted by Andrew Warwick (2003) \"Masters of Theory\":\n Each four-dimensional solution could be inverted in a four-dimensional hyper-sphere of pseudo-radius formula_37 in order to produce a new solution.\nWarwick highlights this \"new theorem of relativity\" as a Cambridge response to Einstein, and as founded on exercises using the method of inversion, such as found in James Hopwood Jeans textbook \"Mathematical Theory of Electricity and Magnetism\".\nGeneral relativity.\nIn general relativity, conformal maps are the simplest and thus most common type of causal transformations. Physically, these describe different universes in which all the same events and interactions are still (causally) possible, but a new additional force is necessary to affect this (that is, replication of all the same trajectories would necessitate departures from geodesic motion because the metric tensor is different). It is often used to try to make models amenable to extension beyond curvature singularities, for example to permit description of the universe even before the Big Bang.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Hill", "text": "American railroad promoter and financier (1838\u20131916)\nJames Jerome Hill (September 16, 1838 \u2013 May 29, 1916) was a Canadian-American railway director. He was the chief executive officer of a family of lines headed by the Great Northern Railway, which served a substantial area of the Upper Midwest, the northern Great Plains, and the Pacific Northwest in the United States. Because of the size of this region and the economic dominance exerted by the Hill lines, Hill became known during his lifetime as \"The Empire Builder\", and died in 1916 with a fortune of about $63 million. His former home, James J. Hill House, is now a museum in Saint Paul, Minnesota.\nBiography.\nChildhood and youth.\nJames J. Hill was born September 16, 1838, in Eramosa Township, Upper Canada (now Ontario) to James Hill Jr. and Ann Dunbar. A childhood accident with a bow and arrow blinded him in the right eye. He had nine years of formal schooling. He attended the Rockwood Academy for a short while, where the head of the academy gave him free tuition. He was forced to leave school in 1852 after the death of his father. By that time, he was adept at math, land surveying, and English. His particular talents for English and mathematics were helpful in his career.\nAfter working as a clerk in Kentucky (during which he learned bookkeeping), Hill decided to permanently move to the United States and settled in St. Paul, Minnesota, at the age of 18. His first job in St. Paul was with a steamboat company, where he worked as a bookkeeper. By 1860, he was working for wholesale grocers, for whom he handled freight transfers, especially with railroads and steamboats. Through this work, he learned the freight and transportation business. During this period, Hill began to work for himself for the first time. In the winter, when the Mississippi River was frozen and steamboats could not run, Hill started bidding on other contracts and won several.\nYoung businessman.\nBecause of his previous experiences in shipping and fuel supply, Hill was able to enter both the coal and steamboat businesses. In 1870, he and his partners started the Red River Transportation Company, which offered steam boat transportation between St. Paul and Winnipeg. By 1879 he had a local monopoly by merging with Norman Kittson. In 1867, Hill entered the coal business, and by 1879 it had expanded five times over, giving Hill a local monopoly in the anthracite coal business. During this same period, he also entered into banking and quickly became a member of several major banks' boards of directors. He also bought out bankrupt businesses, built them up again, and resold them\u2014often at a substantial profit. Hill said the secret to his success was \"work, hard work, intelligent work, and then more work.\"\nEntry into Gilded Era railroading.\nDuring the Panic of 1873, a number of railroads, including the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (StP&amp;P), went bankrupt. The StP&amp;P was caught in an almost hopeless legal muddle. Hill researched the StP&amp;P for three years and concluded that it would be possible to turn a profit off the StP&amp;P, provided that the initial capital could be found. He teamed up with Norman Kittson (the man he had merged steamboat businesses with), Donald Smith, George Stephen, and John Stewart Kennedy. Together they not only bought the railroad but also vastly expanded it by bargaining for trackage rights with the Northern Pacific Railway. In May 1879, the St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba Railway Co. (StPM&amp;M) formed with Hill as general manager. His first goal was to expand and upgrade even more.\nHill was a hands-on, detail-obsessed manager. A Canadian of Scotch-Irish Protestant ancestry, he brought many men of the same background into high management. He wanted people to settle along his rail lines, so he sold homesteads to immigrants while transporting them to their new homes on his rail lines. When he was looking for the best path for a track to take, he went on horseback and scouted it personally. Under his management, StPM&amp;M prospered. In 1880, its net worth was $728,000 (equal to $ today); in 1885 it was $25,000,000, equal to $ today.\nOne of Hill's challenges was to avoid federal action against railroads. If the federal government believed that the railroads were making too much profit, they might see this as an opportunity to force lowering of the railway tariff rates. Hill avoided this by investing much of the railroad's profit back into the railroad itself\u2014and charged those investments to operating expense.\n\"Empire Builder\".\nBetween 1883 and 1889, Hill built his railroads across Minnesota, into Wisconsin, and across North Dakota to Montana.\nWhen there was not enough industry in the areas Hill was building, Hill brought the industry in, often by buying out a company and placing plants along his railroad lines. By 1889, he decided that his future lay in expanding into a transcontinental railroad.\nHill said: \"What we want is the best possible line, shortest distance, lowest grades, and least curvature we can build. We do not care enough for Rocky Mountains scenery to spend a large sum of money developing it.\" He got what he wanted, and in January 1893 his Great Northern Railway, running from St. Paul to Seattle, Washington\u2014a distance of more than \u2014was completed. The Great Northern was the first transcontinental built without public money and just a few land grants, and one of the few transcontinental railroads not to go bankrupt.\nHill built his transcontinental railroad north of the competing Northern Pacific line, which had reached the Pacific Northwest over much more difficult terrain with more bridges, steeper grades, and tunnelling. He did much of the route planning himself, traveling over proposed routes on horseback. The key to the Great Northern line was Hill's use of the previously unmapped Marias Pass in northernmost Montana. The pass had initially been described by Lewis and Clark in 1805, but no one since had been able to find it. Hill hired Santiago Jameson to find it. \nThe Great Northern reached Seattle on January 7, 1893.\nIn 1898 Hill purchased control of large parts of the Mesabi Range iron mining district in Minnesota, along with its rail lines. The Great Northern began large-scale shipment of ore to the steel mills of the Midwest.\nSettlements.\nThe Great Northern energetically promoted settlement along its lines in North Dakota and Montana, especially by Germans and Scandinavians from Europe. The Great Northern bought its lands from the federal government\u2014it received no land grants\u2014and resold them to farmers at cheap prices. It operated agencies in Germany and Scandinavia that promoted its lands, and brought families over at low cost. Hill also invested in founding schools and churches for these communities and promoted a variety of progressive techniques to ensure they prospered. \nThis \"Dakota Boom\" of largely Northern Europeans pouring into North Dakota's Red River Valley along the Minnesota border between 1871 and 1890 peaked in 1882 with 42,000 immigrants.\nHill Lines in the 1890s.\nSix months after the railroad reached Seattle came the deep nationwide depression called the Panic of 1893. Hill's leadership became a case study in the successful management of a capital-intensive business during the economic downturn. In order to ensure that he did not lose his patronage during the crisis, Hill lowered rail tariff shipping rates for farmers, gave credit to many of the businesses he owned so they could continue paying their workers, and started a \"10 dollar trip\" (equal to $ today) for immigrants. He also took strong measures to economize\u2014in just one year, Hill cut the railway's expense of carrying a ton of freight by 13%. Because of these measures, Hill not only stayed in business, but also increased the net worth of his railroad by nearly $10,000,000 (equal to $ today). Meanwhile, nearly every other transcontinental railroad went bankrupt. His ability to ride out the depression garnered him fame and admiration. Hill saved money by repeatedly cutting wages, made possible by a time of deflation when prices were falling generally.\nIn 1893, Hill began the process of looking for a source of labor other than Chinese workers. For a brief period of time, he hired Italian and Greek laborers, but company officials were not satisfied with their performance. Hill sent emissaries to the Pacific who found that Japan had the most potential in the market of \"Oriental Trade,\" and he decided to capitalize on this opportunity.\nIn this time he also began to focus his energies on securing trade with Asian countries. He offered Japanese Industrialists Southern cotton and would even ship it for free if they would compare it with the short staple cotton they were using with the promise of a refund if they were dissatisfied, which they were not. With these friendly relations established, Hill managed to secure the industrializing Japanese order for 15,000 tons of rails against competition from England and Belgium. From 1886 to 1905, American exports to Japan leapt from $7.7 million a year (equal to $ today) to $51.7 million, equal to $ today.\nLeonard says that after 1900 Hill exhibited poor business judgment regarding one Canadian subsidiary, the Vancouver, Westminster and Yukon Railway Company (VW&amp;Y). He ousted its president John Hendry, thereby worsening the problems, prolonging the delays, and adding to the costs of taking over the VW&amp;Y. Hill's top aides were careless about details, bookkeeping, correspondence, and reports.\nThe Northern Pacific and the \"short squeeze\" of 1901.\nWith 1901 and the start of the new century, James Hill now had control of both the Great Northern Railway, and the Northern Pacific (which he had obtained with the help of his friend J. P. Morgan, when that railroad went bankrupt in the depression of the mid-1890s). Hill also wanted control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy railroad because of its Midwestern lines and access to Chicago. The Union Pacific Railroad was the biggest competitor of Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railroads. Although Great Northern and Northern Pacific were backed by J. P. Morgan and James J. Hill, the Union Pacific was backed not only by its president, Edward H. Harriman, but by the extremely powerful William Rockefeller and Jacob Schiff.\nQuietly, Harriman began buying stock in Northern Pacific with the intention of gaining control of Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy. He was within 40,000 shares of control when Hill learned of Harriman's activities and quickly contacted J. P. Morgan, who ordered his men to buy everything they could get their hands on.\nThe result was chaos on Wall Street. Northern Pacific stock was forced up to $1,000 per share. Many speculators, who had sold Northern Pacific \"short\" in the anticipation of a drop in the railroad's price, faced ruin. The threat of a real economic panic loomed. Neither side could win a distinct advantage, and the parties soon realized that a truce would have to be called. The outcome was the formation of the Northern Securities Company, which added Harriman to the joint control of the Northern Pacific, Great Northern, and Chicago, Burlington and Quincy railroads.\nNorthern Securities Company gets Trust Busted.\nJust as the Hill-Morgan-Harriman alliance formed, Theodore Roosevelt became president and turned his energies against the great trusts that were monopolizing trade. He sent his Justice Department to sue the Northern Securities Company in 1902. The Supreme Court in 1904 ordered it to be dissolved as a monopoly. (Ironically, the Burlington Route, Northern Pacific, and Great Northern would later merge in 1970 to form the Burlington Northern Railroad.) This ended Hill's ability to maintain competitive rates in Asian countries and in the subsequent two years American trade with Japan and China dropped 40% (or $41 million).\nHill continues on.\nIn the aftermath of the dissolution of the Northern Securities Company Hill moved on without the benefit of a central company, and acquired the Colorado and Southern Railway lines into Texas. He also built the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway. \nThe Great Northern Railway and the Northern Pacific tried to merge four times, in 1896, 1901, 1927, and 1955. This last attempt lasted from 1955 until final Supreme Court approval and merger in March 1970, which created the Burlington Northern Railroad. In 1995, Burlington Northern merged with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to become the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway.\nBy the time of his death in 1916, James J. Hill was worth more than $63 million, equivalent to $ today, and over $200 million in related assets. When his estate was divided his widow received over $16 million, and each of his children received almost $4 million; $1.5 million was paid in income and inheritance taxes.\nPersonal life.\nIn addition to philanthropic endeavors, Hill lead a substantial and active life outside of business, resulting in a diverse and impressive legacy.\nIn 1867, he married Mary Theresa Mehegan, a Roman Catholic (born 1846, New York City); they had ten children, nine reaching adulthood:\nFrom 1901 to 1915, Hill took an annual salmon fishing trip to Riviere Ste. Jean in Quebec aboard his yacht \"Wacouta\". Members of his family accompanied him on many of these trips as did such notables at former President Grover Cleveland, former Secretary of War Daniel S. Lamont, and George F. Baker, President of the First National Bank of New York.\nDeath.\nBy early 1916, Hill began pouring more attention into philanthropy, donating thousands of dollars to various institutions as he privately struggled with a variety of increasingly painful ailments. His condition deteriorated quickly in mid-May, but even with the help of many respected doctors his condition worsened. After falling into a coma, he died in his home in St. Paul, Minnesota, on May 29, 1916.[14] Mary Theresa Hill died in 1921 and was buried next to her husband by the shore of Pleasant Lake on their North Oaks farm. They were later reinterred at Resurrection Cemetery in Mendota Heights.\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Give me Swedes, snuff and whiskey, and I'll build a railroad through hell.\nPolitically, Hill was a conservative Bourbon Democrat. The Democratic Party's support of the Populist movement and \nWilliam Jennings Bryan led Hill to back Republican presidential candidates William McKinley (1896 and 1900), Theodore Roosevelt (1904), and William Howard Taft (1908 and 1912). Hill was a supporter of free trade and was one of the few supporters of free trade with Canada.\nIn St. Paul, the city's main library building and the adjoining Hill Business Library were funded by him. In addition, he donated to numerous schools, including the Saint Paul Seminary. Hill was a member of the Jekyll Island Club (aka The Millionaires Club) on Jekyll Island, Georgia, along with J. P. Morgan and William Rockefeller.\nIn 1891, after three years of construction, work was completed on Hill's massive new mansion in St. Paul. Over 400 workers labored to build the James J. Hill House, at a cost of $930,000. As with his business dealings, Hill supervised the construction and design himself, hiring and firing several architects in the process. The house has many early electrical and mechanical systems that predate widespread adoption in modern domestic structures. \nUpon completion of the new residence, Hill had the family's old house, which he had constructed in 1878, razed. After the death of Hill's wife in 1921, the house was donated to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis. It was obtained by the Minnesota Historical Society in 1978 and today is operated as a museum and gallery.\nThough a Protestant, Hill was married to a practicing Catholic, and maintained a strong philanthropic relationship with the Catholic Church in St. Paul and throughout the northwest. Hill's historic home is located next to the cathedral, largely due to the special relationship Hill's wife had with the Diocese. The Hills maintained close ties with Archbishop John Ireland, and Hill was a major contributor to the Saint Paul Seminary, Macalester College, Hamline University, the University of St. Thomas, Carleton College, and other educational, religious and charitable organizations. He was the first major donor to the Marquette University School of Medicine.\nIn order to generate business for his railroad, Hill encouraged European immigrants to settle along his line, often paying for Russian and Scandinavian settlers to travel from Europe. To promote settlement and revenue for his rail business, Hill experimented with agriculture and worked to hybridize Russian wheat for Dakota soil and weather conditions. He also ran model experimental farms in Minnesota, such as North Oaks, to experiment in dairying and develop superior livestock and crop yields for the settlers locating near his railroads.\nAn enthusiastic conservationist, Hill was invited by President Theodore Roosevelt to a governors' conference on conservation of natural resources, and later appointed to a lands commission.\nDrawing on his experience in the development of Minnesota's Iron Range, Hill was, during 1911\u20131912, in close contact with Gaspard Farrer of Baring Brothers &amp; Company of London regarding the formation of the Brazilian Iron Ore Company to tap that nation's rich mineral deposits.\nNear the end of his life, Hill played what a recent biographer, Albro Martin, called his \"last and greatest role.\" After the first punishing year of World War I, the Allied Powers desperately needed financial support to continue the war effort. To that end, Hill was a major figure in the effort launched by J.P. Morgan to float the Anglo-French Bond drive of 1915, which allowed the Allies to purchase much-needed foodstuffs and other supplies. In September 1915, the first public loan, the $500,000,000 Anglo-French loan, was floated after negotiations with the Anglo-French Financial Commission. Concomitantly, the resulting trade in munitions with England and France carried the United States from a depression in 1914 to boom years in 1915 and 1916.\nHillsboro, North Dakota; Hill County, Montana; and Hillyard, Washington (now a neighborhood of Spokane), are named for him. Jim Hill Mountain near Stevens Pass in the Cascade Range is named after him, also. The introduced crop weed in Western US wheat-growing areas Sisymbrium altissimum also has a common name \"Jim Hill Mustard\", after the belief by farmers that it was spread from contaminated seed leaking out of railway stock along the railroads he controlled.\nIn 1929, the Great Northern Railway inaugurated a long-distance passenger train extending from Chicago to Seattle, and named it the \"Empire Builder\" in his honor. The train served as Great Northern's flagship train, and is still operated today by Amtrak. using former Great Northern tracks west of St. Paul. The James J. Hill House in St. Paul, is a National Historic Landmark.\nIn 1887, the Great Northern's first company headquarters building was constructed in St. Paul. It was designed by James Brodie, who also built the Hill house on Summit Avenue. The 1887 building was converted between 2000 and 2004 to a 53 unit condo in the Historic Lowertown District of St. Paul. Hill had seen the devastation done downtown by the Great Chicago Fire. As a result, one feature Hill integrated into the construction of the 1887 company headquarters (the Great Northern General Office Building) was barrel-vaulted ceilings constructed of brick and railroad steel rails that held up a layer of sand several inches deep. The theory was that if a fire broke out and the ceiling caved in, the sand would drop and retard or suppress the fire.\nHill was intimately involved in the planning and construction (1914\u20131916) of a new company headquarters in St. Paul (to be known as the Great Northern Office Building), which was to house the corporate staffs of the Great Northern, the Northern Pacific and Hill's banking enterprises. The 14-story building cost $14 million to construct.\nHill's heirs established the James J. Hill Reference Library in St. Paul, which is considered by the Small Business Administration the premier source for publicly accessible practical business information in the United States, and many SBA programs rely on the Hill Library's HillSearch service to provide business information resources to small businesses nationwide. The Hill Library has developed numerous online programs and now serves millions of small business owners worldwide.\nIn \"The Great Gatsby\", Hill is the man whom Gatsby's father says Gatsby would have equalled if he had lived long enough.\nHill and his railway are mentioned in the Harry McClintock song \"Hallelujah, I'm a Bum.\"\nIn 1959, Hill High in St. Paul, Minnesota, was established as a school from the funds set aside from Hill's wife for education. The school, which was all-male, consolidated in 1971 with the all-female Archbishop Murray School to form Hill-Murray School in Maplewood, Minnesota. In 1964 the Jim Hill Middle School in Minot, North Dakota was founded and named in his legacy.\nhttp:// is a venture capital fund established in 2016 \"aligned with James J. Hill's belief in the cooperation of the production, distribution and exchange of wealth as outlined in his writings\". The Hill library owns 75 shares. As of September 2016, the fund is not yet closed.\nIn 1958, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.\nA bust of Hill is located on the University of Washington campus in Seattle, Washington. It is currently situated in front of More Hall. \nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ford's father, who became a music critic for \"The Times\", was German and his mother English. His paternal grandfather was the first to publish the Westphalian poet and author Annette von Droste-H\u00fclshoff. He was named after his maternal grandfather, the Pre-Raphaelite painter Ford Madox Brown, whose biography he would eventually write. His mother's older half-sister was Lucy Madox Brown, the wife of William Michael Rossetti and mother of Olivia Rossetti Agresti.\nIn 1889, after the death of their father, Ford and Oliver went to live with their grandfather in London. Ford attended the University College School in London, but never studied at university. In November 1892, at 18, he became a Catholic, \"very much at the encouragement of some Hueffer relatives, but partly (he confessed) galled by the 'militant atheism and anarchism' of his English cousins.\"\nPersonal life.\nIn 1894, Ford eloped with his school girlfriend Elsie Martindale. The couple were married in Gloucester and moved to Bonnington in Kent. In 1901, they moved to Winchelsea. They had two daughters, Christina (born 1897) and Katharine (born 1900). Ford's neighbours in Winchelsea included the authors Joseph Conrad, Stephen Crane, W. H. Hudson, Henry James in nearby Rye, and H. G. Wells.\nIn 1904, Ford suffered an agoraphobic breakdown due to financial and marital problems. He went to Germany to spend time with family there and undergo treatments.\nIn 1909, Ford left his wife and set up home with English writer Isobel Violet Hunt, with whom he published the literary magazine \"The English Review\". Ford's wife refused to divorce him and he attempted to become a German citizen to obtain a divorce in Germany. This was unsuccessful. A reference in an illustrated paper to Violet Hunt as \"Mrs. Ford Madox Hueffer\" gave rise to a successful libel action being brought by Mrs. Elsie Hueffer in 1913. Ford's relationship with Hunt did not survive the First World War.\nFord used the name of Ford Madox Hueffer, but changed it to Ford Madox Ford after World War I in 1919, partly to fulfil the terms of a small legacy, partly \"because a Teutonic name is in these days disagreeable\", and possibly to avoid further lawsuits from Elsie in the event of his new companion being referred to as \"Mrs. Hueffer\".\nBetween 1918 and 1927, he lived with Stella Bowen, an Australian artist 20 years his junior. In 1920, Ford and Bowen had a daughter, Julia Madox Ford.\nIn the summer of 1927, \"The New York Times\" reported that Ford had converted a mill building in Avignon, France into a home and workshop that he called \"Le Vieux Moulin\". The article implied that Ford was reunited with his wife at this point.\nIn the early 1930s, Ford established a relationship with Janice Biala, a Polish-born artist from New York, who illustrated several of Ford's later books. This relationship lasted until the late 1930s.\nFord spent the last years of his life teaching at Olivet College in Olivet, Michigan, US. Olivet president, Joseph Brewer, admired Ford\u2019s literary stature and wanted him to contribute to the college\u2019s cultural mission. Ford\u2019s acceptance was driven by his need for financial stability and his desire to mentor young writers. Robie Macauley who wrote the 1950 introduction to Ford's \"Parade\u2019s End\" includes his reflections on Ford at Olivet.\nHe was taken ill in Honfleur, France, in June 1939 and died shortly afterward in Deauville at the age of 65.\nLiterary life.\nOne of Ford's most famous works is the novel \"The Good Soldier\" (1915). Set just before World War I, \"The Good Soldier\" chronicles the tragic expatriate lives of two \"perfect couples\", one British and one American, using intricate flashbacks. In the \"Dedicatory Letter to Stella Ford\" that prefaces the novel, Ford reports that a friend pronounced \"The Good Soldier\" \"the finest French novel in the English language!\" Ford pronounced himself a \"Tory mad about historic continuity\" and believed the novelist's function was to serve as the historian of his own time. However, he was dismissive of the Conservative Party, referring to it as \"the Stupid Party.\"\nFord was involved in British war propaganda after the beginning of World War I. He worked for the War Propaganda Bureau, managed by C. F. G. Masterman, along with Arnold Bennett, G. K. Chesterton, John Galsworthy, Hilaire Belloc and Gilbert Murray. Ford wrote two propaganda books for Masterman; \"When Blood is Their Argument: An Analysis of Prussian Culture\" (1915), with the help of Richard Aldington, and \"Between St. Dennis and St. George: A Sketch of Three Civilizations\" (1915).\nAfter writing the two propaganda books, Ford enlisted at 41 years of age into the Welsh Regiment of the British Army on 30 July 1915. He was sent to France. Ford's combat experiences and his previous propaganda activities inspired his tetralogy \"Parade's End\" (1924\u20131928), set in England and on the Western Front before, during and after World War I.\nFord wrote dozens of novels as well as essays, poetry, memoirs and literary criticism. He collaborated with Joseph Conrad on three novels, \"The Inheritors\" (1901), \"Romance\" (1903) and \"The Nature of a Crime\" (1924, although written much earlier). During the three to five years after this direct collaboration, Ford's best known achievement was \"The Fifth Queen\" trilogy (1906\u20131908), historical novels based on the life of Katharine Howard, which Conrad termed, at the time, \"the swan song of historical romance.\"\nFord's poem \"Antwerp\" (1915) was praised by T. S. Eliot as \"the only good poem I have met with on the subject of the war\".\nFord's novel \"Ladies Whose Bright Eyes\" (1911, extensively revised in 1935) is a time travel novel, like Twain's classic \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\", only dramatising the difficulties, not the rewards, of such idealised situations.\nWhen the Spanish Civil War broke out, Ford took the side of the left Republican faction, declaring: \"I am unhesitatingly for the existing Spanish Government and against Franco's attempt\u2014on every ground of feeling and reason\u00a0... Mr Franco wishes to establish a government resting on the arms of Moors, Germans, Italians. Its success must be contrary to world conscience.\" His opinion of Mussolini and Hitler was likewise negative, and he offered to sign a manifesto against Nazism.\nPromotion of literature.\nIn 1908, Ford founded \"The English Review\". Ford published works by Thomas Hardy, H. G. Wells, Joseph Conrad, Henry James, May Sinclair, John Galsworthy and W. B. Yeats; and debuted works of Ezra Pound, Wyndham Lewis, D. H. Lawrence and Norman Douglas. Ezra Pound and other Modernist poets in London in the teens particularly valued Ford's poetry as exemplifying treatment of modern subjects in contemporary diction. In 1924, he founded \"The Transatlantic Review\", a journal with great influence on modern literature. Staying with the artistic community in the Latin Quarter of Paris, Ford befriended James Joyce, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound and Jean Rhys, all of whom he would publish (Ford was the model for the character Braddocks in Hemingway's \"The Sun Also Rises\"). Basil Bunting worked as Ford's assistant on the magazine.\nAs a critic, Ford is known for remarking \"Open the book to page ninety-nine and read, and the quality of the whole will be revealed to you.\" George Seldes, in his book \"Witness to a Century\", describes Ford (\"probably in 1932\") recalling his writing collaboration with Joseph Conrad, and the lack of acknowledgment by publishers of his status as co-author. Seldes recounts Ford's disappointment with Hemingway: \"'and he disowns me now that he has become better known than I am.' Tears now came to Ford's eyes.\" Ford says, \"I helped Joseph Conrad, I helped Hemingway. I helped a dozen, a score of writers, and many of them have beaten me. I'm now an old man and I'll die without making a name like Hemingway.\" Seldes observes, \"At this climax Ford began to sob. Then he began to cry.\"\nHemingway devoted a chapter of his Parisian memoir \"A Moveable Feast\" to an encounter with Ford at a caf\u00e9 in Paris during the early 1920s. He describes Ford \"as upright as an ambulatory, well clothed, up-ended hogshead.\"\nDuring a later sojourn in the United States, Ford was involved with Allen Tate, Caroline Gordon, Katherine Anne Porter and Robert Lowell (who was then a student). Ford was always a champion of new literature and literary experimentation. In 1929, he published \"The English Novel: From the Earliest Days to the Death of Joseph Conrad\", a brisk and accessible overview of the history of English novels. He had an affair with Jean Rhys, which ended acrimoniously, which Rhys fictionalised in her novel \"Quartet\".\nReception.\nFord is best remembered for his novels \"The Good Soldier\" (1915), the \"Parade's End\" tetralogy (1924\u20131928) and \"The Fifth Queen\" trilogy (1906\u20131908). \"The Good Soldier\" is frequently included among the great literature of the 20th century, including the Modern Library 100 Best Novels, \"The Observer\"\u2032s \"100 Greatest Novels of All Time\", and \"The Guardian\"\u2032s \"1000 novels everyone must read\". The \"Parade's End\" tetralogy was made into an acclaimed BBC/HBO 5 part TV series in 2012, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and scripted by Tom Stoppard.\nAnthony Burgess described Ford as the \"greatest British novelist\" of the 20th century. Graham Greene was also a great admirer, and more recently Julian Barnes who has written essays about Ford and his work. Professor Max Saunders is the author of an authoritative biography of Ford, published in two volumes by Oxford University Press in 1996, followed up by a single volume focusing on two of Ford's novels, \"The Good Soldier\" (1915), the \"Parade's End\" tetralogy (1924\u20131928), in 2023. Saunders has also edited some of Ford's oeuvre reissued by the Carcanet Press.\nSelected works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Giant sequoia specimens are the largest trees on Earth. They are native to the groves on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California but have been introduced, planted, and grown around the world.\nThe giant sequoia is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN with fewer than 80,000 remaining in its native California.\nThe giant sequoia grow to an average height of with trunk diameters ranging from . Record trees have been measured at tall. The specimen known to have the greatest diameter at breast height is the General Grant tree at . Giant sequoias are among the oldest living organisms on Earth. The oldest known giant sequoia is 3,200\u20133,266 years old.\nWood from mature giant sequoias is fibrous and brittle; trees would often shatter after they were felled. The wood is unsuitable for construction and instead is used for fence posts or match sticks. The giant sequoia is a very popular ornamental tree in many parts of the world.\nEtymology.\nThe etymology of the genus name was long presumed, initially in \"The Yosemite Book\" by Josiah Whitney in 1868, to be in honor of Sequoyah (1767\u20131843), who was the inventor of the Cherokee syllabary. An etymological study published in 2012 debunked that \"American myth\", concluding that Austrian Stephen L. Endlicher derived the name from the Latin word \"sequi\" (meaning \"to follow\"), because the number of seeds per cone in the newly classified genus aligned in mathematical sequence with the other four genera in the suborder.\nDescription.\nGiant sequoia specimens are the most massive individual trees in the world. They grow to an average height of with trunk diameters ranging from . Record trees have been measured at tall. Trunk diameters of have been claimed via research figures taken out of context. The specimen known to have the greatest diameter at breast height is the General Grant Tree at . Between 2014 and 2016, it is claimed that specimens of coast redwood were found to have greater trunk diameters than all known giant sequoias \u2013 though this has not been independently verified or affirmed in any academic literature. The trunks of coast redwoods taper at lower heights than those of giant sequoias which have more columnar trunks that maintain larger diameters to greater heights.\nThe oldest known giant sequoia is 3,200\u20133,266 years old based on dendrochronology. That tree has been verified to have the fourth-largest lifespan of any tree, after individuals of Great Basin bristlecone pine and alerce. Giant sequoia bark is fibrous, furrowed, and may be thick at the base of the columnar trunk. The sap contains tannic acid, which provides significant protection from fire damage. The leaves are evergreen, awl-shaped, long, and arranged spirally on the shoots.\nThe wood is famously resistant to decay. A \"nearly complete\" \"S. giganteum\" log has been discovered south of the Nelder Grove which gave a radiocarbon-14 date of 10,000 years. Due to the longevity, fast growth, and large growth of this species, it also has high carbon storage potential for carbon sequestration.\nThe giant sequoia regenerates by seed. The seed cones are long and mature in 18\u201320 months, though they typically remain green and closed for as long as 20 years. Each cone has 30\u201350 spirally arranged scales, with several seeds on each scale, giving an average of 230 seeds per cone. Seeds are dark brown, long, and broad, with a wide, yellow-brown wing along each side. Some seeds shed when the cone scales shrink during hot weather in late summer, but most are liberated by insect damage or when the cone dries from the heat of fire. The trees do not begin to bear cones until they are 12 years old.\nTrees may produce sprouts from their stumps subsequent to injury, until about 20 years old; however, shoots do not form on the stumps of more mature trees as they do on coast redwoods. Giant sequoias of all ages may sprout from their boles when branches are lost to fire or breakage.\nA large tree may have as many as 11,000 cones. Cone production is greatest in the upper portion of the canopy. A mature giant sequoia disperses an estimated 300,000\u2013400,000 seeds annually. The winged seeds may fly as far as from the parent tree.\nLower branches die readily from being shaded, but trees younger than 100 years retain most of their dead branches. Trunks of mature trees in groves are generally free of branches to a height of , but solitary trees retain lower branches.\nDistribution.\nThe natural distribution of giant sequoias is restricted to a limited area of the western Sierra Nevada, California. As a paleoendemic species, they occur in scattered groves, with a total of 81 groves (see list of sequoia groves for a full inventory), comprising a total area of only . Nowhere does it grow in pure stands, although in a few small areas, stands do approach a pure condition. The northern two-thirds of its range, from the American River in Placer County southward to the Kings River, has only eight disjunct groves. The remaining southern groves are concentrated between the Kings River and the Deer Creek Grove in southern Tulare County. Groves range in size from with 20,000 mature trees, to small groves with only six living trees. Many are protected in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and Giant Sequoia National Monument.\nThe giant sequoia is usually found in a humid climate characterized by dry summers and snowy winters. Most giant sequoia groves are on granitic-based residual and alluvial soils. The elevation of the giant sequoia groves generally ranges from in the north, to to the south. Giant sequoias generally occur on the south-facing sides of northern mountains, and on the northern faces of more southerly slopes.\nHigh levels of reproduction are not necessary to maintain the present population levels. Few groves, however, have sufficient young trees to maintain the present density of mature giant sequoias for the future. The majority of giant sequoia groves are currently undergoing a gradual decline in density since European settlement.\nPre-historic range.\nWhile the present day distribution of this species is limited to a small area of California, it was once much more widely distributed in prehistoric times, and was a reasonably common species in North American and Eurasian coniferous forests until its range was greatly reduced by the last ice age. Older fossil specimens reliably identified as giant sequoia have been found in Cretaceous era sediments from a number of sites in North America and Europe, and even as far afield as New Zealand and Australia.\nArtificial groves.\nIn 1974, a group of giant sequoias was planted by the United States Forest Service in the San Jacinto Mountains of Southern California in the immediate aftermath of a wildfire that left the landscape barren. The giant sequoias were rediscovered in 2008 by botanist Rudolf Schmidt and his daughter Mena Schmidt while hiking on Black Mountain Trail through Hall Canyon. Black Mountain Grove is home to over 150 giant sequoias, some of which stand over tall. This grove is not to be confused with the Black Mountain Grove in the southern Sierra. Nearby Lake Fulmor Grove is home to seven giant sequoias, the largest of which is tall. The two groves are located approximately southeast of the southernmost naturally occurring giant sequoia grove, Deer Creek Grove.\nIt was later discovered that the United States Forest Service had planted giant sequoias across Southern California. However, the giant sequoias of Black Mountain Grove and nearby Lake Fulmor Grove are the only ones known to be reproducing and propagating free of human intervention. The conditions of the San Jacinto Mountains mimic those of the Sierra Nevada, allowing the trees to naturally propagate throughout the canyon.\nEcology.\nGiant sequoias are in many ways adapted to forest fires. Their bark is unusually fire resistant, and their cones will normally open immediately after a fire. Giant sequoias are a pioneer species, and are having difficulty reproducing in their original habitat (and very rarely reproduce in cultivation) due to the seeds only being able to grow successfully in full sun and in mineral-rich soils, free from competing vegetation. Although the seeds can germinate in moist needle humus in the spring, these seedlings will die as the duff dries in the summer. They therefore require periodic wildfire to clear competing vegetation and soil humus before successful regeneration can occur. Without fire, shade-loving species will crowd out young sequoia seedlings, and sequoia seeds will not germinate. These trees require large amounts of water and are often concentrated near streams. Their growth is dependent on soil moisture. Squirrels, chipmunks, finches and sparrows consume the freshly sprouted seedlings, preventing their growth.\nFires also bring hot air high into the canopy via convection, which in turn dries and opens the cones. The subsequent release of large quantities of seeds coincides with the optimal postfire seedbed conditions. Loose ground ash may also act as a cover to protect the fallen seeds from ultraviolet radiation damage. Due to fire suppression efforts and livestock grazing during the early and mid-20th century, low-intensity fires no longer occurred naturally in many groves, and still do not occur in some groves today. The suppression of fires leads to ground fuel build-up and the dense growth of fire-sensitive white fir, which increases the risk of more intense fires that can use the firs as ladders to threaten mature giant sequoia crowns. Natural fires may also be important in keeping carpenter ants in check.\nIn 1970, the National Park Service began controlled burns of its groves to correct these problems. Current policies also allow natural fires to burn. One of these untamed burns severely damaged the second-largest tree in the world, the Washington tree, in September 2003, 45 days after the fire started. This damage made it unable to withstand the snowstorm of January 2005, leading to the collapse of over half the trunk.\nIn addition to fire, two animal agents also assist giant sequoia seed release. The more significant of the two is a longhorn beetle (\"Phymatodes nitidus\") that lays eggs on the cones, into which the larvae then bore holes. Reduction of the vascular water supply to the cone scales allows the cones to dry and open for the seeds to fall. Cones damaged by the beetles during the summer will slowly open over the next several months. Some research indicates many cones, particularly higher in the crowns, may need to be partially dried by beetle damage before fire can fully open them. The other agent is the Douglas squirrel (\"Tamiasciurus douglasi\") that gnaws on the fleshy green scales of younger cones. The squirrels are active year-round, and some seeds are dislodged and dropped as the cone is eaten.\nMore than 30 identified species of bird have been observed living in giant sequoia groves.\nGenome.\nThe genome of the giant sequoia was published in 2020. The size of the giant sequoia genome is 8.125 Gbp (8.125 billion base pairs) which were assembled into eleven chromosome-scale scaffolds, the largest of any organism at the time of publication.\nThis is the first genome sequenced in the family Cupressaceae, and it provides insights into disease resistance and survival for this robust species on a genetic basis. The genome was found to contain over 900 complete or partial predicted NLR genes used by plants to prevent the spread of infection by microbial pathogens.\nThe genome sequence was extracted from a single fertilized seed harvested from a 1,360-year-old tree specimen in Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Park identified as SEGI 21. It was sequenced over a three-year period by researchers at University of California, Davis, Johns Hopkins University, University of Connecticut, and Northern Arizona University and was supported by grants from Save the Redwoods League and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture as part of a species conservation, restoration and management effort.\nDiscovery and naming.\nDiscovery.\nThe giant sequoia first gained widespread attention in 1852 when grizzly hunter Augustus T. Dowd discovered the Discovery Tree in Calaveras Grove, marking the species' first widely publicized discovery by non-natives. The tree was cut down in 1853 and exhibited across the United States. The story of Dowd's discovery gained further notoriety following a 1859 feature in \"Hutchings' Illustrated California Magazine\", which promoted tourism to the grove.\nBefore Augustus T. Dowd's well-known discovery in 1852, there were three earlier encounters with giant sequoias. The first known mention of the giant sequoia by a European American was in 1833 by Zenas Leonard, a member of the Joseph R. Walker Party, who recorded it in his diary. While Leonard did not specify a location, his travels likely took him through Calaveras Grove, but this observation remained unnoticed.\nIn 1850, John M. Wooster encountered a giant sequoia at Calaveras Grove and carved his initials into the bark of the \"Hercules\" tree. A year later, in 1851, Robert Eccleston traveled through Nelder Grove with a small detachment of the Mariposa Battalion during the Mariposa War. Similar to Leonard's experience, these encounters also received no publicity.\nNaming.\nThe first scientific naming of the species was by John Lindley in December 1853, who named it \"Wellingtonia gigantea\", without realizing this was an invalid name under the botanical code as the name \"Wellingtonia\" had already been used earlier for another unrelated plant (\"Wellingtonia arnottiana\" in the family Sabiaceae). The name \"Wellingtonia\" has persisted in England as a common name. The following year, Joseph Decaisne transferred it to the same genus as the coast redwood, naming it \"Sequoia gigantea\", but this name was also invalid, having been applied earlier (in 1847, by Endlicher) to the coast redwood. The name \"Washingtonia californica\" was also applied to it by Winslow in 1854; this name too is invalid, since it was already used for the palm genus \"Washingtonia\".\nIn 1907, it was placed by Carl Ernst Otto Kuntze in the otherwise fossil genus \"Steinhauera\", but doubt as to whether the giant sequoia is related to the fossil originally so named makes this name invalid.\nThese nomenclatural oversights were corrected in 1939 by John Theodore Buchholz, who also pointed out the giant sequoia is distinct from the coast redwood at the genus level and coined the name \"Sequoiadendron giganteum\" for it.\nThe etymology of the genus name has been presumed\u2014initially in \"The Yosemite Book\" by Josiah Whitney in 1868\u2014to be in honor of Sequoyah (1767\u20131843), who was the inventor of the Cherokee syllabary. An etymological study published in 2012, however, concluded that the name was more likely to have originated from the Latin \"sequi\" (meaning \"to follow\") since the number of seeds per cone in the newly classified genus fell in mathematical sequence with the other four genera in the suborder.\nJohn Muir wrote of the species in about 1870:\n\"Do behold the King in his glory, King Sequoia! Behold! Behold! seems all I can say. Some time ago I left all for Sequoia and have been and am at his feet, fasting and praying for light, for is he not the greatest light in the woods, in the world? Where are such columns of sunshine, tangible, accessible, terrestrialized?'\nUses.\nWood from mature giant sequoias is highly resistant to decay, but due to being fibrous and brittle, it is generally unsuitable for construction. From the 1880s through the 1920s, logging took place in many groves in spite of marginal commercial returns. The Hume-Bennett Lumber Company was the last to harvest giant sequoia, going out of business in 1924. Due to their weight and brittleness, trees would often shatter when they hit the ground, wasting much of the wood. Loggers attempted to cushion the impact by digging trenches and filling them with branches. Still, as little as 50% of the timber is estimated to have made it from groves to the mill. The wood was used mainly for shingles and fence posts, or even for matchsticks.\nPictures of the once majestic trees broken and abandoned in formerly pristine groves, and the thought of the giants put to such modest use, spurred the public outcry that caused most of the groves to be preserved as protected land. The public can visit an example of 1880s clear-cutting at Big Stump Grove near General Grant Grove. As late as the 1980s, some immature trees were logged in Sequoia National Forest, publicity of which helped lead to the creation of Giant Sequoia National Monument.\nThe wood from immature trees is less brittle, with recent tests on young plantation-grown trees showing it similar to coast redwood wood in quality. This is resulting in some interest in cultivating giant sequoia as a very high-yielding timber crop tree, both in California and also in parts of western Europe, where it may grow more efficiently than coast redwoods. In the northwest United States, some entrepreneurs have also begun growing giant sequoias for Christmas trees. Besides these attempts at tree farming, the principal economic uses for giant sequoia today are tourism and horticulture.\nCultural symbol.\nGiant sequoias, native to California and discovered during the final phase of frontier expansion, hold a distinctive place in American culture. They embody the complex interplay of human ambition, environmental exploitation, and the emergence of the modern conservation movement.\nIn the 19th century, sequoias such as the Discovery Tree and Forest King were cut down and transported to urban centers and world expositions as exhibition trees. These displays highlighted the grandeur of the American frontier while exposing humanity's capacity to exploit nature. The paradox of celebrating these giants' majesty while destroying them sparked debates that eventually led to the establishment of Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks.\nThe creation of tunnel trees, including the iconic Wawona Tree, further cemented the cultural legacy of the sequoias. By carving pathways through their immense trunks, Americans celebrated their ability to master the wilderness, embodying the spirit of exploration and progress that defined the nation's expansion. These trees became popular tourist attractions during the rise of the automobile age, embodying the frontier spirit of exploration and progress. However, as the weakened trees began to collapse, they came to symbolize the unintended consequences of human ambition. Today, the California Tunnel Tree, the last surviving tunnel tree, protected in Mariposa Grove, stands as a relic of the past and a symbol of changing values.\nAmericans have also imbued the giant sequoia with sacred meaning. The General Grant Tree, for example, was named the \"Nation's Christmas Tree\" by Calvin Coolidge in 1926 and later declared a national shrine by Dwight Eisenhower to honor the country's war dead. It remains the only living object designated as a national shrine.\nThreats.\nGiant sequoias, once primarily threatened by logging, now face their greatest danger from the absence of regular fires. Fire suppression, severe wildfires, and competition from shade-tolerant species have disrupted the natural cycle that once relied on periodic wildfires to release seeds and clear undergrowth.\nNatural wildfires historically played a key role in sequoia reproduction, releasing seeds from cones and clearing undergrowth to create the open, nutrient-rich conditions needed for seedlings. Fire suppression over the last century has disrupted this cycle, limiting reproduction in many groves. Without regular fires, the buildup of fuel and the excessive growth of more fire-sensitive trees, like white fir, have increased the risk of devastating crown fires, which have already destroyed significant portions of the sequoia population.\nMany destructive wildfires have hit giant sequoia groves in recent decades, including the McNally Fire in 2002, the Rough Fire in 2015, and the Railroad Fire in 2017. The Castle Fire in 2020 is estimated to have wiped out 10\u201314% of the giant sequoia population, or about 7,500 to 10,600 mature trees, possibly including the King Arthur Tree, one of the tallest known sequoias. In 2021, the KNP Complex and Windy Fire added to the damage, killing an estimated 3 to 5% more of the population.\nControlled burns have been effective in protecting giant sequoias. In the 2022 Washburn Fire, officials credited prescribed burns in Yosemite National Park with limiting the fire's intensity and sparing Mariposa Grove from major harm. Experts warn that to preserve healthy groves and prevent future destruction, the use of prescribed burns must increase significantly\u2014by about 30 times the current levels.\nAround the world.\nGiant sequoia is a very popular ornamental tree in many areas. It is successfully grown in most of western and southern Europe, the Pacific Northwest of North America, north to southwest British Columbia, the southern United States, southeast Australia, New Zealand and central-southern Chile. It is also grown, though less successfully, in parts of eastern North America.\nTrees can withstand temperatures of \u221231\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221225\u00a0\u00b0F) or colder for short periods of time, provided the ground around the roots is insulated with either heavy snow or mulch. Outside its natural range, the foliage can suffer from damaging windburn.\nA wide range of horticultural varieties have been selected, especially in Europe, including blue, compact blue, powder blue, hazel smith, pendulum\u2014or weeping\u2014varieties, and grafted cultivars.\nFrance.\nThe tallest giant sequoia ever measured outside of the United States is a specimen planted near Ribeauvill\u00e9 in France in 1856 and measured in 2014 at a height between and at age 158 years.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe giant sequoia was first brought into cultivation in Britain in 1853 by the horticulturist Patrick Matthew of Perthshire from seeds sent by his botanist son John in California. A much larger shipment of seed collected from the Calaveras Grove by William Lobb, acting for the Veitch Nursery near Exeter, arrived in England in December 1853; seed from this batch was widely distributed throughout Europe.\nGrowth in Britain is very fast, with the tallest tree, at Benmore in southwest Scotland, reaching in 2014 at age 150 years, and several others from tall; the stoutest is around in girth and in diameter, in Perthshire. The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, and in their second campus at Wakehurst, contain multiple large specimens of the species. Biddulph Grange Garden in Staffordshire holds a fine collection of both \"Sequoiadendron giganteum\" and \"Sequoia sempervirens\" (coast redwood). The appropriately 2,500 year-old General Sherman of California has a volume of ; by way of comparison, the largest giant sequoias in Great Britain have volumes no greater than , one example being the specimen in the New Forest.\n\"Sequoiadendron giganteum\" has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\nAn avenue of 218 giant sequoias was planted in 1865 near the town of Camberley, Surrey, England. The trees have since been surrounded by modern real estate development.\nIn 2024, there were 4,949 notable sequoias in the UK. There is uncertainty if this is an undercount or overcount of the trees. In addition there are an estimated 500,000 younger \"Sequoiadendron giganteum\" and \"Sequoia sempervirens\". Growing conditions are generally more conducive for these trees than in their native range in the US.\nGermany.\nProbably the oldest sequoia in Germany and possibly of continental Europe was planted in 1852 as a gift of the British Royal Family to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt in a park near Bensheim. In 2015 it reached a height of and a circumference of and is praised for its beauty. It is also the largest sequoia in Germany.\nKing William I of W\u00fcrttemberg (1816\u20131864) imported seeds shortly before his death. In the greenhouses of the Wilhelma in Stuttgart grew between 5000 and 8000 seedlings. Thirty-five of those trees are still present in the Wilhelma. The seedlings got distributed to the whole country of W\u00fcrttemberg and elsewhere and planted on different soils, under various conditions and elevations for a long-time evaluation to find out if they are suitable for forestry. At least 135 of them still can be traced back to these seedlings.\nSince then the tree is well established as ornamental tree in public parks and cemeteries, but also on private properties and can be found planted in small groups in the woods.\nTwo members of the German Dendrology Society, E. J. Martin and Illa Martin, introduced the giant sequoia into German forestry at the Sequoiafarm Kaldenkirchen in 1952.\nItaly.\nNumerous giant sequoia were planted in Italy from 1860 through 1905. Several regions contain specimens that range from in height. The largest tree is in Roccavione, in the Piedmont, with a basal circumference of . One notable tree survived a tall flood wave in 1963 that was caused by a landslide at Vajont Dam. There are numerous giant sequoia in parks and reserves.\nGrowth rates in some areas of Europe are remarkable. One young tree in Italy reached tall and trunk diameter in 17 years.\nNorthern, Central and Southeast Europe.\nGrowth further northeast in Europe is limited by winter cold. In Denmark, where extreme winters can reach , the largest tree was tall and diameter in 1976 and is bigger today. One in Poland has purportedly survived temperatures down to with heavy snow cover.\nTwenty-nine giant sequoias, measuring around in height, grow in Belgrade's municipality of Lazarevac in Serbia.\nThe oldest \"Sequoiadendron\" in the Czech Republic, at , grows in Ratm\u011b\u0159ice u Votic castle garden.\nIn Slatina, Croatia, 32.5\u00a0m (107\u00a0ft) tall giant sequoia grows in city park. Presumably seeded in 1890 and proclaimed as nature monument in 1967, now stands as a centerpiece in town's educational, presentational and informational center with tourist facilities available.\nAbove the city of Kyustendil, Bulgaria, there are around 100 giant sequoias, oldest being around 100 years old.\nUnited States and Canada.\nGiant sequoias are grown successfully in the Pacific Northwest and southern US, and less successfully in eastern North America. Giant sequoia cultivation is very successful in the Pacific Northwest from western Oregon north to southwest British Columbia, with fast growth rates. In Washington and Oregon, it is common to find giant sequoias that have been successfully planted in both urban and rural areas. There are hundreds of sequoias planted on the Olympic Peninsula over the last 100 years and farms that have 50 or more planted 40 years ago or longer.\nIn Seattle, a sequoia stands as a prominent landmark at the entrance to Seattle's downtown retail core. Other large specimens exceeding are located on the University of Washington and Seattle University campuses, in the Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park cemetery, and in the Leschi, Madrona, and Magnolia neighborhoods.\nIn the northeastern US there has been some limited success in growing the species, but growth is much slower there, and it is prone to \"Cercospora\" and \"Kabatina\" fungal diseases due to the hot, humid summer climate there. A tree at Blithewold Gardens, in Bristol, Rhode Island, is reported to be tall, reportedly the tallest in the New England states. The tree at the Tyler Arboretum in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, at may be the tallest in the northeast. Specimens also grow in the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts (planted 1972, 18 m tall in 1998), at Longwood Gardens near Wilmington, Delaware, in the New Jersey State Botanical Garden at Skylands in Ringwood State Park, Ringwood, New Jersey, and in the Finger Lakes region of New York. Private plantings of giant sequoias around the Middle Atlantic States are not uncommon, and other publicly accessible specimens can be visited at the U.S. National Arboretum in Washington, D.C. A few trees have been established in Colorado as well. Additionally, numerous sequoias have been planted with success in the state of Michigan.\nA cold-tolerant cultivar 'Hazel Smith' selected in about 1960 is proving more successful in the northeastern US. This clone was the sole survivor of several hundred seedlings grown at a nursery in New Jersey. The U.S. National Arboretum has a specimen grown from a cutting in 1970 that can be seen in the Gotelli Conifer Collection.\nSince its last assessment as an endangered species in 2011, it was estimated that another 13\u201319% of the population (or 9,761\u201313,637 mature trees) were destroyed during the Castle Fire of 2020 and the KNP Complex &amp; Windy Fire in 2021, events attributed to fire suppression and drought. Prescribed burns to reduce available fuel load may be crucial for saving the species.\nAs of 2021, there are approximately 60,000 living in its native California.\nAustralia.\nThe Ballarat Botanical Gardens contain a significant collection, many of them about 150 years old. Jubilee Park and the Hepburn Mineral Springs Reserve in Daylesford, Cook Park in Orange, New South Wales and Carisbrook's Deep Creek park in Victoria both have specimens. Jamieson Township in the Victorian high country has two specimens which were planted in the early 1860s.\nIn Tasmania, specimens can be seen in private and public gardens, as sequoias were popular in the mid-Victorian era. The Westbury Village Green has specimens with more in Deloraine. The Tasmanian Arboretum contains both \"Sequoiadendron giganteum\" and \"Sequoia sempervirens\" specimens.\nThe Pialligo Redwood Forest consists of 3,000 surviving redwood specimens, of 122,000 planted, 500 meters east of the Canberra Airport. The forest was laid out by the city's designer Walter Burley Griffin, though the city's arborist, Thomas Charles Weston, advised against it. The National Arboretum Canberra began a grove of \"Sequoiadendron giganteum\" in 2008. They also grow in the abandoned arboretum at Mount Banda Banda in New South Wales.\nNew Zealand.\nSeveral impressive specimens of Sequoiadendron giganteum can be found in the South Island of New Zealand. Notable examples include a set of trees in a public park of Picton, as well as robust specimens in the public and botanical parks of Christchurch and Queenstown. There are also several in private gardens in W\u0101naka. Other locations in Christchurch and nearby include a number of trees at the Riccarton Park Racecourse, three large trees on the roadside bordering private properties on Clyde Road, near Wai-Iti Terrace\u2014these are at least 150 years old. The suburb of 'Redwood' is named after a 160 years old Giant Redwood tree in the grounds of a local hotel. At St James Church, Harewood, is a protected very large specimen believed to be about 160 years old. A grove of about sixteen Redwood trees of varying ages is in Sheldon Park in the Belfast, New Zealand suburb. Some of these trees are in poor condition because of indifferent care. There is also a very large tree at Rangiora High School, which was planted for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee and is thus over 130 years old.\nRecord trees.\nLargest by trunk volume.\nAs of 2009, the top ten largest giant sequoias sorted by volume of their trunks are:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50640", "revid": "17040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50640", "title": "Texas Longhorn", "text": "American breed of cattle\nThe Texas Longhorn is an American breed of beef cattle, characterized by its long horns, which can span more than from tip to tip. It derives from cattle brought from the Iberian Peninsula to the Americas by Spanish conquistadors from the time of the Second Voyage of Christopher Columbus until about 1512. For hundreds of years the cattle lived a semi-feral existence on the rangelands; they have a higher tolerance of heat and drought than most European breeds. The coat can be of any color or mix of colors; in some 40% of the cattle it is some shade of red, often a light red.\nIn the twenty-first century, the Longhorn is considered a part of the cultural heritage of Texas.343\nHistory.\nThe Texas Longhorn derives from cattle brought to the Americas by Spanish conquistadors from the time of the Second Voyage of Christopher Columbus until about 1512. The first cattle were landed in 1493 on the Caribbean island of La Isla Espa\u00f1ola (now known as Hispaniola) to provide food for the colonists.279\nOver the next two centuries, the Spaniards used the cattle in Mexico and gradually moved them north to accompany their expanding settlements. The Spaniards reached the area that became known as \"Texas\" near the end of the 17th century. Eventually, some cattle escaped or were turned loose on the open range, where they remained mostly feral for the next two centuries. Over several generations, descendants of these cattle developed to have high feed- and drought-stress tolerances and other \"hardy\" characteristics that have given Longhorns their reputation as livestock.\nThe Texas Longhorn stock slowly dwindled, but in 1927, the breed was saved from near extinction by enthusiasts from the United States Forest Service. They collected a small herd of stock to breed on the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge in Lawton, Oklahoma. The breed also received significant attention after a Texas Longhorn named \"Bevo\" was adopted as the mascot of The University of Texas at Austin in 1917. The animal's image became commonly associated with the school's sports teams, known as the Texas Longhorns. A few years later, J. Frank Dobie and others gathered small herds to keep in Texas state parks. Oilman Sid W. Richardson helped finance the project. The Longhorns were cared for largely as curiosities, but the stock's longevity, resistance to disease, and ability to thrive on marginal pastures resulted in a revival of the breed as beef stock and for their link to Texas history.\nIn 1957, Charles Schreiner III began creating a Longhorn herd on his ranch, the \"Y O\", in Mountain Home, Texas, as a tribute to the ranching legacy of his grandfather, Captain Charles Armand Schreiner, and the Longhorns he ran on his ranches. Schreiner purchased five heifers and one bull calf for $75 each from the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge near Lawton. In 1964, Schreiner founded the Texas Longhorn Breeders Association of America. The YO herd were the first cattle registered with the association. To draw attention to the Longhorn and its new association, in 1966, Schreiner organized a cattle drive of Longhorn steers from San Antonio, Texas to Dodge City, Kansas. The drive was promoted as a centennial commemoration of the earlier Chisholm Trail drives. Schreiner arranged for local members of the Quanah sheriff's posse to stage a simulated \u201cIndian attack\u201d as the steers crossed the Red River at https://. The attack was so authentic that the steers stampeded with cowboys in close pursuit. Four hours were needed to reassemble the herd. In 1976, Texas Tech University in Lubbock persuaded Schreiner to stage a cattle trail drive to celebrate its new National Ranching Heritage Center.\nIn 1995, the Texas Legislature designated the Texas Longhorn as the state large mammal. In the 21st century, Texas Longhorns from elite bloodlines can sell for $40,000 or more at auction. The record of $380,000 on March 18, 2017, was for a cow, 3S Danica, and heifer calf at side, during the Legacy XIII sale in Fort Worth, Texas.\nRegistries for the breed include: the Texas Longhorn Breeders Association of America, founded in 1964 by the Kerr County rancher Charles Schreiner III; the International Texas Longhorn Association; and the Cattlemen's Texas Longhorn Registry. The online National Texas Longhorn Museum displays the diversity of horns found in the breed, stories about notable individual cattle of the breed, and a gallery of furniture made from cattle horns.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Longhorn is genetically close to Iberian cattle breeds such as the De Lidia and Retinta of Spain and the Alentejana and Mertolenga of Portugal. Like other Criollo cattle of the Americas and many breeds of southern Europe, it is principally of taurine (European) derivation, but has a small admixture of indicine genetic heritage; this may be a consequence of gene flow across the Strait of Gibraltar from cattle of African origin dating to before the time of the Spanish Conquest.\nThe horns are in some cases very long. In general, the horns of bulls are of moderate length, while those of steers may be much longer.313 In 2022 the Guinness Book of Records reported the longest spread of cattle horns (on a living animal) to be: for a steer called Poncho Via; for a cow named 3S Danica; and for a bull named Cowboy Tuff Chex. All three were Texas Longhorns.\nCoat color is extremely variable. In some 40% of the cattle it is some shade of red, often a light red; the only shade of red not seen is the deep colour typical of the Hereford. The finching pattern is common; when the base color is black it is called , from the Spanish word for 'skunk'.313 Other colors include variations of black, blue, brown, cream, dun, grey, yellow or white, either with or without brindling (called , from the Spanish word for 'cat'), speckling or spotting.313 Speckled and solid-coloured animals are in roughly equal proportion.\nUse.\nThe Longhorn was traditionally reared for beef. In the 21st century it is considered part of the cultural heritage of Texas;343 it is the official large mammal of the state.\nIt may be kept for conservation reasons, or bred for greater horn length. It is occasionally used for steer riding.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "50649", "revid": "45925219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50649", "title": "Home economics", "text": "Study of household management\nHome economics, also called home ec, domestic science, household arts, or family and consumer sciences (often shortened to FCS or FACS), is a subject concerning human development, personal and family finances, consumer issues, housing and interior design, nutrition and food preparation, as well as textiles and apparel. Although historically mostly taught in secondary school or high school, dedicated home economics courses are much less common today. Home economics overlaps with the concept of \"life skills-based education\".\nHome economics courses are offered around the world and across multiple educational levels. Historically, the purpose of these courses was to professionalize housework, to provide intellectual fulfillment for women, to emphasize the value of \"women's work\" in society, and to prepare them for the traditional roles of sexes. Family and consumer sciences are taught as an elective or required course in secondary education, as a continuing education course in institutions, and at the primary level. \u00a0\nBeginning in Scotland in the 1850s, it was a woman-dominated course, teaching women to be homemakers with sewing being the lead skill. The American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences at the beginning of the 20th century saw Americans desiring youth to learn vocational skills as well. Politics played a role in home economics education, and it wasn't until later in the century that the course shifted from being woman-dominated to now required for both sexes. \u00a0\nNow family and consumer science have been included in the broader subject of Career Technical Education, a program that teaches skilled trades, applied sciences, modern technologies, and career preparation. Despite the widening of the subject matter over the past century, there has been a major decline in home economics courses offered by educational institutions.\nTerminology.\nFamily and consumer sciences were previously known in the United States as home economics, often abbreviated as \"home ec\" or \"HE\". In 1994, various organizations, including the American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences, adopted the new term \"Family and Consumer Sciences (FCS)\" to reflect the fact that the field covers aspects outside of home life and wellness. FCS is taught worldwide, as an elective or a required course in secondary education, and in many tertiary and continuing education institutions. Sometimes it is also taught in primary education. International cooperation in the field is coordinated by the International Federation for Home Economics, established in 1908.\nThese programs have been called human sciences, home science, domestic economy, and the domestic arts, the domestic sciences, or the domestic arts and sciences, and may still be referred to as such depending on the academic institution. Home economics has a strong historic relationship to the field of human ecology, and since the 1960s a number of university-level home economics programs have been renamed \"human ecology\" programs, including Cornell University's program.\nBy country.\nInternationally, Home Economics education is coordinated by the International Federation for Home Economics (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration internationale pour l'\u00e9conomie familiale).\nCanada.\nIn the majority of elementary (K-6) and public (K-8) schools in Canada, home economics is not taught. General health education is provided as part of a physical education class. In high schools or secondary schools, there is no specific home economics course, but students may choose related courses to take, such as Family Studies, Food and Nutrition, or Health and Safety.\nFinland.\nFinland has a 110-year history in home economics teacher education. Household economics and nutrition have been taught at university level since the 1940s. Finland has made home economics a required course for boys and girls. When at university, home economics courses fall under categories of the culture and education of nutrition and food, consumer education, environmental education, and family education. The Finnish National Core Curriculum for Basic Education in 2014 also states to reach sustainable development, home economics must be one of the key elements throughout curriculum.\nGermany.\nBetween 1880 and 1900, the Reifenstein schools concept was initiated by Ida von Kortzfleisch, a Prussian noble woman and early German feminist. Reifenstein refers to Reifenstein im Eichsfeld, a municipality in Thuringia and site of the first permanent school. Reifensteiner Verband comprised from 1897 till 1990 about 15 own schools and cooperated with further operators. About 40 wirtschaftliche Frauenschulen, rural economist women schools were connected to the Reifensteiner concept and movement and allowed higher education for women already in the German Kaiserreich. The 1913 doctorate of Johannes Kramer compared different concepts of home economic education worldwide and praised the system e.g. in Iowa.\nAdditionally, home economics are taught as an optional course in lower- and mid-level secondary schools (Haupt- und Realschule).\nIndia.\nMany education boards in India such as NIOS, CBSE, ICSE, CISCE and various state boards offer home science as a subject in their courses, sometimes called Human Ecology and Family Sciences.\nIndonesia.\nHome economics are known in Indonesia as Family Training and Welfare (). It is rooted on a 1957 conference on home economics held in Bogor; it became state policy in 1972.\nIran.\nThe new books are Family management and planning lifestyle for girls in secondary high schools and a similar book for boys just as well.\nIreland.\nHome economics was taught to girls in the junior cycle of secondary school in the 20th century. It was added to the senior cycle Leaving Certificate in 1971, at a time when elimination of school fees was increasing participation. In subsequent decades new co-educational community schools saw more boys studying the subject. Increased third-level education participation from the 1990s saw a decline in practical subjects not favoured for third-level entry requirements, including home economics.\nItaly.\nIn 1945, just days before the Liberation of World War II, Ada Gobetti stated, \"The most difficult problem will be that of the housewife. It will be one of the most difficult to resolve if one wants to create a new society.\" She wanted women, family, work, and society to form a new relationship through education and organization of the housewives. Although people were not taught formal classes of home economics, during the 1950s and 1960s home economics manuals had been fully published. These manuals were compulsory for children to read in school. These manuals focused heavily on how to be a good housewife during a new era of transformation and how to adapt to new behaviors and habits.\nStarting from the Gentile reform of 1923, home economics was taught in the lower middle school and in the new unified middle school established in 1963. The name changed to Technical Applications, differentiated into male and female, which was taught until 1977 when it changed to the title of Technical Education, which no longer differed in relation to the sex of the pupils.\nSouth Korea.\nIn South Korea, the field is most commonly known as \"consumer science\" (\uc18c\ube44\uc790\ud559, sobija-hak). The field began in schools taught by Western missionaries in the late 19th century. The first college-level department of family science was established at Ewha Womans University in Seoul in 1929.\nSweden.\nIn Sweden, Home economics is commonly known as \"home- and consumer studies\" (\"hem- och konsumentkunskap\").\nThe subject is mandatory from middle years until high school in both public and private schools but is regarded as one of the smallest subjects in the Swedish school system.\nFor many decades, the subject was only called \"hemkunskap\" and had a strong focus on the traditional common tasks of a home, family and practical cooking and cleaning. After the 2011 Swedish school reform, the curriculum have been restructured with more focus on the topics of health, economy and environment which includes Consumer economics as well as Consumer awareness.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn 1852 Louisa Hope and others created the Scottish Ladies Association for Promoting Female Industrial Education. The intention was to ensure that females would learn sewing and in time other domestic subjects in separate gender based education. The Church of Scotland had decided in 1849 that it wanted female \"schools of industry\". Women were seen as centres of moral and religious values for families and upper class ladies in the new association saw it as their role to provide it.\nIn 1853 Hope published, \"The Female Teacher: Ideas Suggestive of Her Qualifications and Duties\" where she notes that women should be \"keepers at home\" and men should see to his \"labour and his work until the evening\". Education of females would elevate the \"lower classes\" and this was the \"aim of the Scottish Ladies Association for Promoting Female Industrial Education\".\nHope organised a petition of 130 signatures of \"principal ladies of Scotland\" demanding improved sewing lesson for girls in Scottish schools. The petition was supported by letters sent to newspapers and this was of underestimated influence. By 1861 grants were available to support this objective and in 1870 70% of schools were including sewing in their curriculum according to inspectors.\nThereza Charlotte, Lady Rucker (1863 \u2013 1941) was a promoter of household science teaching. She helped establish Domestic Science as a university subject but only at one university in England.\nIn the UK, Home Economics was a GCSE qualification offered to secondary school pupils, but since 2015 been replaced with a course entitled Food and Nutrition which focuses more on the nutritional side of food to economics.\nIn Scotland, Home Economics was replaced by Hospitality: Practical Cooking at National 3, 4 and 5 level and Health and Food Technology at National 3, 4, 5, Higher and Advanced Higher. The awarding body is the SQA.\nUnited States.\nNineteenth century.\nOver the years, homemaking in the United States has been a foundational piece of the education system, particularly for women. These homemaking courses, called home economics, have had a prevalent presence in secondary and higher education since the 19th century. By definition, home economics is \"the art and science of home management\", meaning that the discipline incorporates both creative and technical aspects into its teachings. Home economics courses often consist of learning how to cook, how to do taxes, and how to perform child care tasks. In the United States, home economics courses have been a key part of learning the art of taking care of a household. One of the first to champion the economics of running a home was Catherine Beecher, sister to Harriet Beecher Stowe.\nSince the nineteenth century, schools have been incorporating home economics courses into their education programs. In its early years, home economics began with the goal of professionalizing domestic labor for women whilst also uplifting the idea of \"women's work\". In the United States, the teaching of home economics courses in higher education greatly increased with the Morrill Act of 1862. Signed by Abraham Lincoln, the Act granted land to each state or territory in America for higher educational programs in vocational arts, specifically mechanical arts, agriculture, and home economics. Such land grants allowed for people of a wider array of social classes to receive better education in important trade skills.\nHome economics courses mainly taught students how to cook, sew, garden, and take care of children. The vast majority of these programs were dominated by women. Home economics allowed for women to receive a better education while also preparing them for a life of settling down, doing the chores, and taking care of the children while their husbands became the breadwinners. At this time, homemaking was largely accessible to middle and upper class white women whose families could afford secondary schooling.\nIn the late 19th century, the Lake Placid Conferences took place. The conferences consisted of a group of educators working together to elevate the discipline to a legitimate profession. Originally, they wanted to call this profession \"oekology\", the science of right living. However, \"home economics\" was ultimately chosen as the official term in 1899.\nThe first book on home economics was \"Mrs. Welch's Cookbook\", published in 1884 at Iowa State by Mary Beaumont Welch. Welch's classes on domestic economy were the first in the nation to give college credit on the subject.\nTwentieth century.\nHome economics in the United States education system increased in popularity in the early twentieth century. It emerged as a movement to train women to be more efficient household managers. At the same moment, American families began to consume many more goods and services than they produced. To guide women in this transition, professional home economics had two major goals: to teach women to assume their new roles as modern consumers and to communicate homemakers' needs to manufacturers and political leaders. The development of the profession progressed from its origins as an educational movement to its identity as a source of consumer expertise in the interwar period to its virtual disappearance by the 1970s. An additional goal of the field was to \"rationalize housework\", or lend the social status of a profession to it, based on a theory that housework could be intellectually fulfilling to women engaged in it, along with any emotional or relational benefits.\nPioneers of the field included numerous female figures, such as Ellen Swallow Richards, who had profound impacts on the home economics profession. In 1909, Richards founded the American Home Economics Association (now called the American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences). From 1900 to 1917, more than thirty bills discussed in Congress dealt with issues of American vocational education and, by association, home economics. Americans wanted more opportunities for their young people to learn vocational skills and to learn valuable home and life skills. However, home economics was still dominated by women and women had little access to other vocational trainings. As stated by the National Education Association (NEA) on the distribution of males and females in vocations, \"one-third of our menfolk are in agriculture, and one-third in non-agricultural productive areas; while two-thirds of our women are in the vocation of homemaking\".\nPractice homes were added to American universities in the early 1900s in order to model a living situation, with the first facility built for home management practice constructed in the early 1920s at North Dakota Agricultural College. The all-women 'team' model used for students was different from prevailing expectations of housewives. For example, women were graded on collaboration, while households at the time assumed that women would be working independently. Nevertheless, the practice homes were valued. These practicum courses took place in a variety of environments including single-family homes, apartments, and student dorm-style blocks. For a duration of a number of weeks, students lived together while taking on different roles and responsibilities, such as cooking, cleaning, interior decoration, hosting, and budgeting. Some classes also involved caring for young infants, temporarily adopted from orphanages. Children's service organizations helped supply the babies who were awaiting adoption. At Cornell University, the first practice baby was called Dicky Domecon, named after the phrase \"domestic economy\". Dicky was borrowed by Cornell in 1920 when he was three weeks old. Practice babies belonged to the students and to the department and were considered central to the proper training and development of home economics students. Many fields of high acuity use simulation to enhance training in complicated situations. Childcare practicums were often included at the same time as other classwork, requiring students to configure their intellectual and home lives as compatible with one another. Home economics programs were using practice babies nationwide, however by 1959 less than one percent of programs still ran full-time operations. The practice was discontinued altogether by the early 1970s. According to Megan Elias, \"in the ideal, domestic work was as important as work done outside the home and it was performed by teams of equals who rotated roles. Each member of the team was able to live a life outside the home as well as inside the home, ideally, one that both informed her domestic work and was informed by it. This balance between home and the wider world was basic to the movement.\"\nThere was a great need across the United States to continue improving the vocational and homemaking education systems because demand for work was apparent after World War I and II. Therefore, in 1914 and 1917, women's groups, political parties, and labor coalitions worked together in order to pass the Smith-Lever Act and the Smith-Hughes Act. The Smith-Lever Act of 1914 and the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917 created federal funds for \"vocational education agriculture, trades and industry, and homemaking\" and created the Office of Home Economics. With this funding, the United States was able to create more homemaking educational courses all across the country.\nThroughout the 1940s, Iowa State College (later University) was the only program granting a Master of Science in household equipment. However, this program was centered on the ideals that women should acquire practical skills and a scientifically based understanding of how technology in the household works. For example, women were required to disassemble and then reassemble kitchen machinery so they could understand basic operations and understand how to repair the equipment. In doing so, Iowa State effectively created culturally acceptable forms of physics and engineering for women in an era when these pursuits were not generally accessible to them.\nThroughout the latter part of the twentieth century, home economics courses became more inclusive. In 1963, Congress passed the Vocational Education Act, which granted funds to vocational education job training. Home economics courses started being taught across the nation to both boys and girls by way of the rise of second-wave feminism. This movement pushed for gender equality, leading to equality in education. Starting in 1994, home economics courses in the United States began being referred to as \"family and consumer sciences\" in order to make the class appear more inclusive. With desegregation and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, men and women of all backgrounds could equally learn how to sew, cook, and balance a checkbook.\nIn the 1980s, \"domestic celebrities\" rose to stardom. Celebrities, such as Martha Stewart, created television programs, books, magazines, and websites about homemaking and home economics, which attested to the continued importance of independent experts and commercial mass-media organizations in facilitating technological and cultural change in consumer products and services industries.\nDespite many secondary education establishments still referring to these enrichment classes as \"home economics\", the name was officially changed in 1994 by the American Association of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences to \"family and consumer sciences\" to more accurately represent the profession and field as a whole. As society changed over time, so did the needs of students in these classes. Topics such as nutrition, family finance, and other social justice issues have been added to family and consumer sciences classes, most frequently taught in high schools and colleges.\nTwenty-first century.\nToday FCS is part of the broader Career Technical Education (CTE) umbrella. Career and technical education is a term applied to programs that specialize in skilled trades, applied sciences, modern technologies, and career preparation. \u00a0While traditional home economics focused on preparing women to care for a family and home, family consumer science continues to adapt its course offerings to meet the needs of students both for personal growth and professional opportunities. Students can take classes in culinary arts, education, food science, nutrition, health and wellness, interior design, child development, personal finance, textiles, apparel, and retailing. Students who take FCS classes can join the student organization Family, Career, and Community Leaders of America.\nFCS and CTE courses help prepare students for careers rather than university. Also, homemaking and home economics courses have developed a negative connotation because of the negative gender bias associated with home economics courses. Despite this, homemaking is now socially acceptable for both men and women to partake in. In the United States, both men and women are expected to take care of the home, the children, and the finances. More women are pursuing higher education rather than homemaking. In 2016, 56.4% of college students were female as opposed to 34.5% in 1956. Some schools are starting to incorporate life skill courses back into their curriculum, but as a whole, home economics courses have been in major decline in the past century.\nIn 2012 there were only 3.5 million students enrolled in FCS secondary programs, a decrease of 38 percent over a decade. In 2020 the AAFCS estimates that there are 5 million students enrolled in FCS programs, a significant increase from past years that is still growing.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nSocieties and associations\nResources"}
{"id": "50650", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50650", "title": "Astronomy", "text": "Scientific study of celestial objects\nAstronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and the phenomena that occur in the cosmos. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry to explain their origin and their overall evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, meteoroids, asteroids, and comets. Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates beyond Earth's atmosphere. Cosmology is the branch of astronomy that studies the universe as a whole.\nAstronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history made methodical observations of the night sky. These include the Egyptians, Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of calendars.\nProfessional astronomy is split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects. This data is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. These two fields complement each other. Theoretical astronomy seeks to explain observational results and observations are used to confirm theoretical results.\nAstronomy is one of the few sciences in which amateurs play an active role. This is especially true for the discovery and observation of transient events. Amateur astronomers have helped with many important discoveries, such as finding new comets.\nEtymology.\n\"Astronomy\" (from the Greek \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 from \u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \"astron\", \"star\" and -\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \"-nomia\" from \u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \"nomos\", \"law\" or \"rule\") means study of celestial objects. Astronomy should not be confused with astrology, the belief system which claims that human affairs are correlated with the positions of celestial objects. The two fields share a common origin but became distinct, astronomy being supported by physics while astrology is not.\nUse of terms \"astronomy\" and \"astrophysics\".\n\"Astronomy\" and \"astrophysics\" are broadly synonymous in modern usage. In dictionary definitions, \"astronomy\" is \"the study of objects and matter outside the Earth's atmosphere and of their physical and chemical properties\", while \"astrophysics\" is the branch of astronomy dealing with \"the behavior, physical properties, and dynamic processes of celestial objects and phenomena\". Sometimes, as in the introduction of the introductory textbook \"The Physical Universe\" by Frank Shu, \"astronomy\" means the qualitative study of the subject, whereas \"astrophysics\" is the physics-oriented version of the subject. Some fields, such as astrometry, are in this sense purely astronomy rather than also astrophysics. Research departments may use \"astronomy\" and \"astrophysics\" according to whether the department is historically affiliated with a physics department, and many professional astronomers have physics rather than astronomy degrees. Thus, in modern use, the two terms are often used interchangeably.\nHistory.\nPre-historic.\nThe initial development of astronomy was driven by practical needs like agricultural calendars. Before recorded history archeological sites such as Stonehenge provide evidence of ancient interest in astronomical observations. \nEvidence also comes from artefacts such as the Nebra sky disc which serves as an astronomical calendar, defining a year as twelve lunar months, 354 days, with intercalary months to make up the solar year. The disc is inlaid with symbols interpreted as a sun, moon, and stars including a cluster of seven stars.\nClassical.\nCivilizations such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, India, China together \u2013 with cross-cultural influences \u2013 created astronomical observatories and developed ideas on the nature of the Universe, along with calendars and astronomical instruments. A key early development was the beginning of mathematical and scientific astronomy among the Babylonians, laying the foundations for astronomical traditions in other civilizations. The Babylonians discovered that lunar eclipses recurred in the saros cycle of 223 synodic months.\nFollowing the Babylonians, significant advances were made in ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world. Greek astronomy sought a rational, physical explanation for celestial phenomena. In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of Samos estimated the size and distance of the Moon and Sun, and he proposed a model of the Solar System where the Earth and planets rotated around the Sun, now called the heliocentric model. In the 2nd century BC, Hipparchus calculated the size and distance of the Moon and invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the astrolabe. He also observed the small drift in the positions of the equinoxes and solstices with respect to the fixed stars that we now know is caused by precession. Hipparchus also created a catalog of 1020 stars, and most of the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy. The Antikythera mechanism (c.\u2009150\u201380 BC) was an early analog computer designed to calculate the location of the Sun, Moon, and planets for a given date. Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in Europe.\nAfter the classical Greek era, astronomy was dominated by the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Claudius Ptolemy. His 13-volume astronomy work, named the \"Almagest\" in its Arabic translation, became the primary reference for over a thousand years. In this system, the Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. While the system would eventually be discredited it gave the most accurate predictions for the positions of astronomical bodies available at that time.\nPost-classical.\nAstronomy flourished in the medieval Islamic world. Astronomical observatories were established there by the early 9th century. In 964, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest galaxy in the Local Group, was described by the Persian Muslim astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi in his \"Book of Fixed Stars\". The SN 1006 supernova, the brightest apparent magnitude stellar event in the last 1000 years, was observed by the Egyptian Arabic astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan and Chinese astronomers in 1006. Iranian scholar Al-Biruni observed that, contrary to Ptolemy, the Sun's apogee (highest point in the heavens) was mobile, not fixed. Arabic astronomers introduced many Arabic names now used for individual stars.\nThe ruins at Great Zimbabwe and Timbuktu may have housed astronomical observatories. In Post-classical West Africa, astronomers studied the movement of stars and relation to seasons, crafting charts of the heavens and diagrams of orbits of the other planets based on complex mathematical calculations. Songhai historian Mahmud Kati documented a meteor shower in 1583.\nIn medieval Europe, Richard of Wallingford (1292\u20131336) invented the first astronomical clock, the Rectangulus which allowed for the measurement of angles between planets and other astronomical bodies, as well as an equatorium called the \"Albion\" which could be used for astronomical calculations such as lunar, solar and planetary longitudes. Nicole Oresme (1320\u20131382) discussed evidence for the rotation of the Earth. Jean Buridan (1300\u20131361) developed the theory of impetus, describing motions including of the celestial bodies.\nFor over six centuries (from the recovery of ancient learning during the late Middle Ages into the Enlightenment), the Roman Catholic Church gave more financial and social support to the study of astronomy than probably all other institutions. Among the Church's motives was finding the date for Easter.\nEarly telescopic.\nDuring the Renaissance, Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system. In 1610, Galileo Galilei observed phases on the planet Venus similar to those of the Moon, supporting the heliocentric model. Around the same time the heliocentric model was organized quantitatively by Johannes Kepler. Analyzing two decades of careful observations by Tycho Brahe, Kepler devised a system that described the details of the motion of the planets around the Sun. While Kepler discarded the uniform circular motion of Copernicus in favor of elliptical motion, he did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down. It was Isaac Newton, with his invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation, who finally explained the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the reflecting telescope.\nNewton, in collaboration with Richard Bentley proposed that stars are like the Sun only much further away. \nThe new telescopes also altered ideas about stars. By 1610 Galileo discovered that the band of light crossing the sky at night that we call the Milky Way was composed of numerous stars. In 1668 James Gregory compared the luminosity of Jupiter to Sirius to estimate its distance at over 83,000 AU. The English astronomer John Flamsteed, Britain's first Astronomer Royal, catalogued over 3000 stars but the data were published against his wishes in 1712. The astronomer William Herschel made a detailed catalog of nebulosity and clusters, and in 1781 discovered the planet Uranus, the first new planet found. Friedrich Bessel developed the technique of stellar parallax in 1838 but it was so difficult to apply that only about 100 stars were measured by 1900.\nDuring the 18\u201319th centuries, the study of the three-body problem by Leonhard Euler, Alexis Claude Clairaut, and Jean le Rond d'Alembert led to more accurate predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Pierre Simon Laplace, allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations.\nSignificant advances in astronomy came about with the introduction of new technology, including the spectroscope and astrophotography. In 1814\u201315, Joseph von Fraunhofer discovered some 574 dark lines in the spectrum of the sun and of other stars. In 1859, Gustav Kirchhoff ascribed these lines to the presence of different elements.\nGalaxies.\nIn the late 1700s William Herschel mapped the distribution of stars in different directions from Earth, concluding that the universe consisted of the Sun near the center of disk of stars, the Milky Way. After John Michell demonstrated that stars differ in intrinsic luminosity and after Herschel's own observations with more powerful telescopes that additional stars appeared in all directions, astronomers began to consider that some of the fuzzy spiral nebulae were distant \"island Universes\". \nThe existence of galaxies, including the Earth's galaxy, the Milky Way, as a group of stars was only demonstrated in the 20th century. In 1912, Henrietta Leavitt discovered Cepheid variable stars with well-defined, periodic luminosity changes which can be used to fix the star's true luminosity which then becomes an accurate tool for distance estimates. Using Cepheid variable stars, Harlow Shapley constructed the first accurate map of the Milky Way. Using the Hooker Telescope, Edwin Hubble identified Cepheid variables in several spiral nebulae and in 1922\u20131923 proved conclusively that Andromeda Nebula and Triangulum among others, were entire galaxies outside our own, thus proving that the universe consists of a multitude of galaxies.\nCosmology.\nAlbert Einstein's 1917 publication of general relativity began the modern era of theoretical models of the universe as a whole. In 1922, Alexander Friedman published simplified models for the universe showing static, expanding and contracting solutions. \nIn 1929 Hubble published observations that the galaxies are all moving away from Earth with a velocity proportional to distance, a relation now known as Hubble's law. This relation is expected if the universe is expanding. The consequence that the universe was once very dense and hot, a Big Bang concept expounded by Georges Lema\u00eetre in 1927, was discussed but no experimental evidence was available to support it. From the 1940s on, nuclear reaction rates under high density conditions were studied leading to the development of a successful model of big bang nucleosynthesis in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Then in 1965 cosmic microwave background radiation was discovered, cementing the evidence for the Big Bang.\nTheoretical astronomy predicted the existence of objects such as black holes and neutron stars. These have been used to explain phenomena such as quasars and pulsars. \nSpace telescopes have enabled measurements in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum normally blocked or blurred by the atmosphere. The LIGO project detected evidence of gravitational waves in 2015.\nObservational astronomy.\nObservational astronomy relies on many different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation and the forms of astronomy are categorized according to the corresponding region of the electromagnetic spectrum on which the observations are made. Specific information on these subfields is given below.\nRadio.\nRadio astronomy uses radiation with long wavelengths, mainly between 1 millimeter and 15 meters (frequencies from 20 MHz to 300 GHz), far outside the visible range. Hydrogen, otherwise an invisible gas, produces a spectral line at 21 cm (1420 MHz) which is observable at radio wavelengths. Objects observable at radio wavelengths include interstellar gas, pulsars, fast radio bursts, supernovae, and active galactic nuclei.\nInfrared.\nInfrared astronomy detects infrared radiation with wavelengths longer than red visible light, outside the range of our vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous galactic protostars and their host star clusters.\nWith the exception of infrared wavelengths close to visible light, such radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere, or masked, as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission. Consequently, infrared observatories have to be located in high, dry places on Earth or in space. Some molecules radiate strongly in the infrared. This allows the study of the chemistry of space.\nThe James Webb Space Telescope senses infrared radiation to detect very distant galaxies. Visible light from these galaxies was emitted billions of years ago and the expansion of the universe shifted the light in to the infrared range. By studying these distant galaxies astronomers hope to learn about the formation of the first galaxies.\nOptical.\nHistorically, optical astronomy, which has been also called visible light astronomy, is the oldest form of astronomy. Images of observations were originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 380 to 700 nm that same equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation.\nUltraviolet.\nUltraviolet astronomy employs ultraviolet wavelengths which are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, requiring observations from the upper atmosphere or from space. Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited to the study of thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue OB stars that are very bright at these wavelengths.\nX-ray.\nX-ray astronomy uses X-radiation, produced by extremely hot and high-energy processes. Since X-rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, observations must be performed at high altitude, such as from balloons, rockets, or specialized satellites. X-ray sources include X-ray binaries, supernova remnants, clusters of galaxies, and active galactic nuclei. Since the Sun's surface is relatively cool, X-ray images of the Sun and other stars give valuable information on the hot solar corona.\nGamma-ray.\nGamma ray astronomy observes astronomical objects at the shortest wavelengths (highest energy) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, or by specialized telescopes called atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. Cherenkov telescopes do not detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.\nGamma-ray astronomy provides information on the origin of cosmic rays, possible annihilation events for dark matter, relativistic particles outflows from active galactic nuclei (AGN), and, using AGN as distant sources, properties of intergalactic space.\nGamma-ray bursts, which radiate transiently, are extremely energetic events, and are the brightest (most luminous) phenomena in the universe.\nNon-electromagnetic observation.\nSome events originating from great distances may be observed from the Earth using systems that do not rely on electromagnetic radiation.\nIn neutrino astronomy, astronomers use heavily shielded underground facilities such as SAGE, GALLEX, and Kamioka II/III for the detection of neutrinos. The vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the Sun, but 24 neutrinos were also detected from supernova 1987A. Cosmic rays, which consist of very high energy particles (atomic nuclei) that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories. \nGravitational-wave astronomy employs gravitational-wave detectors to collect observational data about distant massive objects. A few observatories have been constructed, such as the \"Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory\" LIGO. LIGO made its first detection on 14 September 2015, observing gravitational waves from a binary black hole. A second gravitational wave was detected on 26 December 2015 and additional observations should continue but gravitational waves require extremely sensitive instruments.\nThe combination of observations made using electromagnetic radiation, neutrinos or gravitational waves and other complementary information, is known as multi-messenger astronomy.\nAstrometry and celestial mechanics.\nOne of the oldest fields in astronomy, and in all of science, is the measurement of the positions of celestial objects known as astrometry. Historically, accurate knowledge of the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets and stars has been essential in celestial navigation (the use of celestial objects to guide navigation) and in the making of calendars. Careful measurement of the positions of the planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational perturbations, and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as celestial mechanics. The measurement of stellar parallax of nearby stars provides a fundamental baseline in the cosmic distance ladder that is used to measure the scale of the Universe. Parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars, as their properties can be compared. Measurements of the radial velocity and proper motion of stars allow astronomers to plot the movement of these systems through the Milky Way galaxy.\nTheoretical astronomy.\nTheoretical astronomers use several tools including analytical models and computational numerical simulations; each has its particular advantages. Analytical models of a process are better for giving broader insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models reveal the existence of phenomena and effects otherwise unobserved. Modern theoretical astronomy reflects dramatic advances in observation since the 1990s, including studies of the cosmic microwave background, distant supernovae and galaxy redshifts, which have led to the development of a standard model of cosmology. This model requires the universe to contain large amounts of dark matter and dark energy whose nature is currently not well understood, but the model gives detailed predictions that are in excellent agreement with many diverse observations.\nSubfields by scale.\nPhysical cosmology.\nPhysical cosmology, the study of large-scale structure of the Universe, seeks to understand the formation and evolution of the cosmos. Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the Big Bang, the concept that the universe begin extremely dense and hot, then expanded over the course of 13.8 billion years to its present condition. The concept of the Big Bang became widely accepted after the discovery of the microwave background radiation in 1965. Fundamental to the structure of the Universe is the existence of dark matter and dark energy. These are now thought to be its dominant components, forming 96% of the mass of the Universe. For this reason, much effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these components.\nExtragalactic.\nThe study of objects outside our galaxy is concerned with the formation and evolution of galaxies, their morphology (description) and classification, the observation of active galaxies, and at a larger scale, the groups and clusters of galaxies. These assist the understanding of the large-scale structure of the cosmos.\nGalactic.\nGalactic astronomy studies galaxies including the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy that is a prominent member of the Local Group of galaxies and contains the Solar System. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is within the dusty outer arms, large portions of the Milky Way are obscured from view.\nKinematic studies of matter in the Milky Way and other galaxies show there is more mass than can be accounted for by visible matter. A dark matter halo appears to dominate the mass, although the nature of this dark matter remains undetermined.\nStellar.\nThe study of stars and stellar evolution is fundamental to our understanding of the Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior. Aspects studied include star formation in giant molecular clouds; the formation of protostars; and the transition to nuclear fusion and main-sequence stars, carrying out nucleosynthesis. Further processes studied include stellar evolution, ending either with supernovae or white dwarfs. The ejection of the outer layers forms a planetary nebula. The remnant of a supernova is a dense neutron star, or, if the stellar mass was at least three times that of the Sun, a black hole.\nSolar.\nSolar astronomy is the study of the Sun, a typical main-sequence dwarf star of stellar class G2 V, and about 4.6 billion years (Gyr) old. Processes studied by the science include the sunspot cycle, the sun's changes in luminosity, both steady and periodic, and the behavior of the sun's various layers, namely its core with its nuclear fusion, the radiation zone, the convection zone, the photosphere, the chromosphere, and the corona.\nPlanetary science.\nPlanetary science is the study of the assemblage of planets, moons, dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, and other bodies orbiting the Sun, as well as exoplanets orbiting distant stars. The Solar System has been relatively well-studied, initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft.\nProcesses studied include planetary differentiation; the generation of, and effects created by, a planetary magnetic field; and the creation of heat within a planet, such as by collisions, radioactive decay, and tidal heating. In turn, that heat can drive geologic processes such as volcanism, tectonics, and surface erosion, studied by branches of geology.\nInterdisciplinary subfields.\nAstrochemistry.\nAstrochemistry is an overlap of astronomy and chemistry. It studies the abundance and reactions of molecules in the Universe, and their interaction with radiation. The word \"astrochemistry\" may be applied to both the Solar System and the interstellar medium. Studies in this field contribute for example to the understanding of the formation of the Solar System.\nAstrobiology.\nAstrobiology (or exobiology) studies the origin of life and its development other than on earth. It considers whether extraterrestrial life exists, and how humans can detect it if it does. It makes use of astronomy, biochemistry, geology, microbiology, physics, and planetary science to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize biospheres that might be different from that on Earth. The origin and early evolution of life is an inseparable part of the discipline of astrobiology. That encompasses research on the origin of planetary systems, origins of organic compounds in space, rock-water-carbon interactions, abiogenesis on Earth, planetary habitability, research on biosignatures for life detection, and studies on the potential for life to adapt to challenges on Earth and in outer space.\nOther.\nAstronomy and astrophysics have developed interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields. Archaeoastronomy is the study of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, using archaeological and anthropological evidence. \nAstrostatistics is the application of statistics to the analysis of large quantities of observational astrophysical data. \nAs \"forensic astronomy\", finally, methods from astronomy have been used to solve problems of art history and occasionally of law.\nAmateur.\nAstronomy is one of the sciences to which amateurs can contribute the most. Collectively, amateur astronomers observe celestial objects and phenomena, sometimes with consumer-level equipment or equipment that they build themselves. Common targets include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, and deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs throughout the world have programs to help their members set up and run observational programs such as to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues.\nMost amateurs work at visible wavelengths, but some have experimented with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy, Karl Jansky, discovered a radio source at the centre of the Milky Way.\nSome amateur astronomers use homemade telescopes or radio telescopes originally built for astronomy research (\"e.g.\" the One-Mile Telescope).\nAmateurs can make occultation measurements to refine the orbits of minor planets. They can discover comets, and perform regular observations of variable stars. Improvements in digital technology have allowed amateurs to make advances in astrophotography.\nUnsolved problems.\nIn the 21st century, there remain important unanswered questions in astronomy. Some are cosmic in scope: for example, what are the dark matter and dark energy that dominate the evolution and fate of the cosmos? What will be the ultimate fate of the universe? Why is the abundance of lithium in the cosmos four times lower than predicted by the standard Big Bang model? Others pertain to more specific classes of phenomena. For example, is the Solar System normal or atypical? What is the origin of the stellar mass spectrum, i.e. why do astronomers observe the same distribution of stellar masses\u2014the initial mass function\u2014regardless of initial conditions? Likewise, questions remain about the formation of the first galaxies, the origin of supermassive black holes, the source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, and whether there is other life in the Universe, especially other intelligent life.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A sequence of functions formula_1 converges uniformly to a limiting function formula_2 on a set formula_3 as the function domain if, given any arbitrarily small positive number formula_4, a number formula_5 can be found such that each of the functions formula_6 differs from formula_2 by no more than formula_4 \"at every point\" formula_9 \"in\" formula_3. \nInformally, formula_1 converges uniformly to formula_2 if to guarantee that formula_13 differs from formula_14 by less than a chosen distance formula_4, we only need to ensure that formula_16 is no less than some formula_5 which we can find without knowing the value of formula_18 in advance. In other words, the rate of convergence is uniform across formula_3: for any small distance formula_4 there exists a number formula_21 that could depend on formula_4, but is \"independent of\" formula_9, such that choosing formula_24 will ensure that formula_25 for \"all\" formula_26\nBy contrast, pointwise convergence of formula_1 to formula_2 merely guarantees that given any formula_29, we can find formula_30 (that is, possibly depending on formula_9 as well as formula_4) such that for the \"specific\" value of formula_9 given, formula_13 falls within formula_4 of formula_14 whenever formula_37 A different formula_9 may require a larger value of formula_39\nThe difference between uniform convergence and pointwise convergence was not fully appreciated early in the history of calculus, leading to instances of faulty reasoning. The concept, which was first formalized by Karl Weierstrass, is important because several properties of the functions formula_40, such as continuity, Riemann integrability, and, with additional hypotheses, differentiability, are transferred to the limit formula_2 if the convergence is uniform, but not necessarily if the convergence is not uniform.\nHistory.\nIn 1821 Augustin-Louis Cauchy published a proof that a convergent sum of continuous functions is always continuous, to which Niels Henrik Abel in 1826 found purported counterexamples in the context of Fourier series, arguing that Cauchy's proof had to be incorrect. Completely standard notions of convergence did not exist at the time, and Cauchy handled convergence using infinitesimal methods. When put into the modern language, what Cauchy proved is that a uniformly convergent sequence of continuous functions has a continuous limit. The failure of a merely pointwise-convergent limit of continuous functions to converge to a continuous function illustrates the importance of distinguishing between different types of convergence when handling sequences of functions.\nThe term uniform convergence was probably first used by Christoph Gudermann, in an 1838 paper on elliptic functions, where he employed the phrase \"convergence in a uniform way\" when the \"mode of convergence\" of a series formula_42 is independent of the variables formula_43 and formula_44 While he thought it a \"remarkable fact\" when a series converged in this way, he did not give a formal definition, nor use the property in any of his proofs.\nLater Gudermann's pupil, Karl Weierstrass, who attended his course on elliptic functions in 1839\u20131840, coined the term \"gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig konvergent\" () which he used in his 1841 paper \"Zur Theorie der Potenzreihen\", published in 1894. Independently, similar concepts were articulated by Philipp Ludwig von Seidel and George Gabriel Stokes. G. H. Hardy compares the three definitions in his paper \"Sir George Stokes and the concept of uniform convergence\" and remarks: \"Weierstrass's discovery was the earliest, and he alone fully realized its far-reaching importance as one of the fundamental ideas of analysis.\"\nUnder the influence of Weierstrass and Bernhard Riemann this concept and related questions were intensely studied at the end of the 19th century by Hermann Hankel, Paul du Bois-Reymond, Ulisse Dini, Cesare Arzel\u00e0 and others.\nDefinition.\nWe first define uniform convergence for real-valued functions, although the concept is readily generalized to functions mapping to metric spaces and, more generally, uniform spaces (see below). \nSuppose formula_3 is a set and formula_46 is a sequence of real-valued functions on it. We say the sequence formula_46 is uniformly convergent on formula_3 with limit formula_49 if for every formula_50 there exists a natural number formula_5 such that for all formula_52 and for all formula_18\nformula_54\nThe notation for uniform convergence of formula_40 to formula_2 is not quite standardized and different authors have used a variety of symbols, including (in roughly decreasing order of popularity): \nformula_57\nFrequently, no special symbol is used, and authors simply write \nformula_58 \nto indicate that convergence is uniform. (In contrast, the expression formula_59 on formula_3 without an adverb is taken to mean pointwise convergence on formula_3: for all formula_62, formula_63 as formula_64.)\nSince formula_65 is a complete metric space, the Cauchy criterion can be used to give an equivalent alternative formulation for uniform convergence: formula_66 converges uniformly on formula_3 (in the previous sense) if and only if for every formula_68, there exists a natural number formula_5 such that\nformula_70.\nIn yet another equivalent formulation, if we define \nformula_71\nthen formula_72 converges to formula_2 uniformly if and only if formula_74 as formula_64. Thus, we can characterize uniform convergence of formula_76 on formula_3 as (simple) convergence of formula_46 in the function space formula_79 with respect to the \"uniform metric\" (also called the supremum metric), defined by \nformula_80\nSymbolically, \nformula_81.\nThe sequence formula_46 is said to be locally uniformly convergent with limit formula_2 if formula_84 is a metric space and for every formula_29, there exists an formula_86 such that formula_1 converges uniformly on formula_88 It is clear that uniform convergence implies local uniform convergence, which implies pointwise convergence.\nNotes.\nIntuitively, a sequence of functions formula_40 converges uniformly to formula_2 if, given an arbitrarily small formula_91, we can find an formula_92 so that the functions formula_40 with formula_94 all fall within a \"tube\" of width formula_95 centered around formula_2 (i.e., between formula_97 and formula_98) for the \"entire domain\" of the function.\nNote that interchanging the order of quantifiers in the definition of uniform convergence by moving \"for all formula_29\" in front of \"there exists a natural number formula_5\" results in a definition of pointwise convergence of the sequence. To make this difference explicit, in the case of uniform convergence, formula_21 can only depend on formula_4, and the choice of formula_5 has to work for all formula_29, for a specific value of formula_4 that is given. In contrast, in the case of pointwise convergence, formula_106 may depend on both formula_4 and formula_9, and the choice of formula_5 only has to work for the specific values of formula_4 and formula_9 that are given. Thus uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence, however the converse is not true, as the example in the section below illustrates.\nGeneralizations.\nOne may straightforwardly extend the concept to functions \"E\" \u2192 \"M\", where (\"M\", \"d\") is a metric space, by replacing formula_112 with formula_113.\nThe most general setting is the uniform convergence of nets of functions \"E\" \u2192 \"X\", where \"X\" is a uniform space. We say that the net formula_114 \"converges uniformly\" with limit \"f\" : \"E\" \u2192 \"X\" if and only if for every entourage \"V\" in \"X\", there exists an formula_115, such that for every \"x\" in \"E\" and every formula_116, formula_117 is in \"V\". In this situation, uniform limit of continuous functions remains continuous.\nDefinition in a hyperreal setting.\nUniform convergence admits a simplified definition in a hyperreal setting. Thus, a sequence formula_40 converges to \"f\" uniformly if for all hyperreal \"x\" in the domain of formula_119 and all infinite \"n\", formula_120 is infinitely close to formula_121 (see microcontinuity for a similar definition of uniform continuity). In contrast, pointwise continuity requires this only for real \"x\".\nExamples.\nFor formula_122, a basic example of uniform convergence can be illustrated as follows: the sequence formula_123 converges uniformly, while formula_124 does not. Specifically, assume formula_125. Each function formula_123 is less than or equal to formula_127 when formula_128, regardless of the value of formula_9. On the other hand, formula_124 is only less than or equal to formula_127 at ever increasing values of formula_16 when values of formula_9 are selected closer and closer to 1 (explained more in depth further below).\nGiven a topological space \"X\", we can equip the space of bounded real or complex-valued functions over \"X\" with the uniform norm topology, with the uniform metric defined by \nformula_134\nThen uniform convergence simply means convergence in the uniform norm topology: \nformula_135.\nThe sequence of functions formula_1 \nformula_137 \nis a classic example of a sequence of functions that converges to a function formula_2 pointwise but not uniformly. To show this, we first observe that the pointwise limit of formula_1 as formula_64 is the function formula_2, given by\n formula_142\n\"Pointwise convergence:\" Convergence is trivial for formula_143 and formula_144, since formula_145 and formula_146, for all formula_16. For formula_148 and given formula_91, we can ensure that formula_25 whenever formula_24 by choosing formula_152, which is the minimum integer exponent of formula_9 that allows it to reach or dip below formula_4 (here the upper square brackets indicate rounding up, see ceiling function). Hence, formula_59 pointwise for all formula_156. Note that the choice of formula_5 depends on the value of formula_4 and formula_9. Moreover, for a fixed choice of formula_4, formula_5 (which cannot be defined to be smaller) grows without bound as formula_9 approaches 1. These observations preclude the possibility of uniform convergence.\n\"Non-uniformity of convergence:\" The convergence is not uniform, because we can find an formula_91 so that no matter how large we choose formula_164 there will be values of formula_165 and formula_52 such that formula_167 To see this, first observe that regardless of how large formula_16 becomes, there is always an formula_169 such that formula_170 Thus, if we choose formula_171 we can never find an formula_5 such that formula_25 for all formula_156 and formula_24. Explicitly, whatever candidate we choose for formula_5, consider the value of formula_177 at formula_178. Since \nformula_179\nthe candidate fails because we have found an example of an formula_156 that \"escaped\" our attempt to \"confine\" each formula_181 to within formula_4 of formula_183 for all formula_156. In fact, it is easy to see that\nformula_185\ncontrary to the requirement that formula_186 if formula_187.\nIn this example one can easily see that pointwise convergence does not preserve differentiability or continuity. While each function of the sequence is smooth, that is to say that for all \"n\", formula_188, the limit formula_189 is not even continuous.\nExponential function.\nThe series expansion of the exponential function can be shown to be uniformly convergent on any bounded subset formula_190 using the Weierstrass M-test.\nTheorem (Weierstrass M-test). \"Let formula_1 be a sequence of functions formula_192 and let formula_193 be a sequence of positive real numbers such that formula_194 for all formula_29 and formula_196 If formula_197 converges, then formula_198 converges absolutely and uniformly on formula_3.\"\nThe complex exponential function can be expressed as the series:\nformula_200\nAny bounded subset is a subset of some disc formula_201 of radius formula_202 centered on the origin in the complex plane. The Weierstrass M-test requires us to find an upper bound formula_203 on the terms of the series, with formula_203 independent of the position in the disc:\nformula_205\nTo do this, we notice\nformula_206\nand take formula_207\nIf formula_208 is convergent, then the M-test asserts that the original series is uniformly convergent.\nThe ratio test can be used here:\nformula_209\nwhich means the series over formula_203 is convergent. Thus the original series converges uniformly for all formula_211 and since formula_212, the series is also uniformly convergent on formula_213\nApplications.\nTo continuity.\nIf formula_3 and formula_221 are topological spaces, then it makes sense to talk about the continuity of the functions formula_222. If we further assume that formula_221 is a metric space, then (uniform) convergence of the formula_40 to formula_2 is also well defined. The following result states that continuity is preserved by uniform convergence:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUniform limit theorem\u2014Suppose formula_3 is a topological space, formula_221 is a metric space, and formula_1 is a sequence of continuous functions formula_229. If formula_187 on formula_3, then formula_2 is also continuous.\nThis theorem is proved by the \"&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; trick\", and is the archetypal example of this trick: to prove a given inequality (that a desired quantity is less than &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;), one uses the definitions of continuity and uniform convergence to produce 3 inequalities (demonstrating three separate quantities are each less than &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;), and then combines them via the triangle inequality to produce the desired inequality.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_proof/styles.css\" /&gt;Proof\nLet formula_233 be an arbitrary point. We will prove that formula_217 is continuous at formula_235. Let formula_236. By uniform convergence, there exists a natural number formula_5 such that\nformula_238\n(uniform convergence shows that the above statement is true for all formula_24, but we will only use it for one function of the sequence, namely formula_177).\nIt follows from the continuity of formula_241 at formula_242 that there exists an open set formula_243 containing formula_244 such that\nformula_245.\nHence, using the triangle inequality,\nformula_246,\nwhich gives us the continuity of formula_217 at formula_244.formula_249\nThis theorem is an important one in the history of real and Fourier analysis, since many 18th century mathematicians had the intuitive understanding that a sequence of continuous functions always converges to a continuous function. The image above shows a counterexample, and many discontinuous functions could, in fact, be written as a Fourier series of continuous functions. The erroneous claim that the pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions is continuous (originally stated in terms of convergent series of continuous functions) is infamously known as \"Cauchy's wrong theorem\". The uniform limit theorem shows that a stronger form of convergence, uniform convergence, is needed to ensure the preservation of continuity in the limit function.\nMore precisely, this theorem states that the uniform limit of \"uniformly continuous\" functions is uniformly continuous; for a locally compact space, continuity is equivalent to local uniform continuity, and thus the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous.\nTo differentiability.\nIf formula_214 is an interval and all the functions formula_40 are differentiable and converge to a limit formula_2, it is often desirable to determine the derivative function formula_253 by taking the limit of the sequence formula_254. This is however in general not possible: even if the convergence is uniform, the limit function need not be differentiable (not even if the sequence consists of everywhere-analytic functions, see Weierstrass function), and even if it is differentiable, the derivative of the limit function need not be equal to the limit of the derivatives. Consider for instance formula_255 with uniform limit formula_256. Clearly, formula_253 is also identically zero. However, the derivatives of the sequence of functions are given by formula_258 and the sequence formula_254 does not converge to formula_260 or even to any function at all. In order to ensure a connection between the limit of a sequence of differentiable functions and the limit of the sequence of derivatives, the uniform convergence of the sequence of derivatives plus the convergence of the sequence of functions at at least one point is required:\n \"If formula_1 is a sequence of differentiable functions on formula_262 such that formula_263 exists (and is finite) for some formula_264 and the sequence formula_265 converges uniformly on formula_262, then formula_40 converges uniformly to a function formula_2 on formula_262, and formula_270 for formula_271.\"\nTo integrability.\nSimilarly, one often wants to exchange integrals and limit processes. For the Riemann integral, this can be done if uniform convergence is assumed:\n \"If formula_272 is a sequence of Riemann integrable functions defined on a compact interval formula_273 which uniformly converge with limit formula_217, then formula_217 is Riemann integrable and its integral can be computed as the limit of the integrals of the formula_276:\" formula_277\nIn fact, for a uniformly convergent family of bounded functions on an interval, the upper and lower Riemann integrals converge to the upper and lower Riemann integrals of the limit function. This follows because, for \"n\" sufficiently large, the graph of formula_40 is within \u03b5 of the graph of \"f\", and so the upper sum and lower sum of formula_40 are each within formula_280 of the value of the upper and lower sums of formula_2, respectively.\nMuch stronger theorems in this respect, which require not much more than pointwise convergence, can be obtained if one abandons the Riemann integral and uses the Lebesgue integral instead.\nTo analyticity.\nUsing Morera's Theorem, one can show that if a sequence of analytic functions converges uniformly in a region S of the complex plane, then the limit is analytic in S. This example demonstrates that complex functions are more well-behaved than real functions, since the uniform limit of analytic functions on a real interval need not even be differentiable (see Weierstrass function).\nTo series.\nWe say that formula_282 converges:\nWith this definition comes the following result:\nLet \"x\"0 be contained in the set \"E\" and each \"f\"\"n\" be continuous at \"x\"0. If formula_283 converges uniformly on \"E\" then \"f\" is continuous at \"x\"0 in \"E\". Suppose that formula_284 and each \"f\"\"n\" is integrable on \"E\". If formula_282 converges uniformly on \"E\" then \"f\" is integrable on \"E\" and the series of integrals of \"f\"\"n\" is equal to integral of the series of fn.\nAlmost uniform convergence.\nIf the domain of the functions is a measure space \"E\" then the related notion of almost uniform convergence can be defined. We say a sequence of functions formula_1 converges almost uniformly on \"E\" if for every formula_287 there exists a measurable set formula_288 with measure less than formula_289 such that the sequence of functions formula_1 converges uniformly on formula_291. In other words, almost uniform convergence means there are sets of arbitrarily small measure for which the sequence of functions converges uniformly on their complement.\nNote that almost uniform convergence of a sequence does not mean that the sequence converges uniformly almost everywhere as might be inferred from the name. However, Egorov's theorem does guarantee that on a finite measure space, a sequence of functions that converges almost everywhere also converges almost uniformly on the same set.\nAlmost uniform convergence implies almost everywhere convergence and convergence in measure.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He has an alter, Mother, who takes the form of his abusive mother, and later victim, Norma, who in his daily life runs the Bates Motel.\nHe was portrayed by Anthony Perkins in the 1960 version of \"Psycho\" directed by Alfred Hitchcock and in the \"Psycho\" franchise. He was also portrayed by Vince Vaughn in the 1998 version of \"Psycho\", and by Freddie Highmore in the television series \"Bates Motel\" (2013\u20132017).\nUnlike the franchise produced by Universal Studios, Norman is not the principal antagonist in Bloch's subsequent novels and is succeeded by copycat killers who assume Norman's identity after his death in \"Psycho II\" (1982), although he does return in the licensed continuation novel \"Psycho: Sanitarium\" (2016) by Chet Williamson. There is a wide-ranging assumption that the character was directly inspired by the Wisconsin murderer Ed Gein. With \"Psycho\" being optioned for film adaptation as a direct result of media attention on Gein, Bloch later revealed he was inspired more by the circumstances surrounding Gein's case\u2014the idea that \"the man next door may be a monster unsuspected even in the gossip-ridden microcosm of small-town life.\" Years later, when the full details of Gein's crimes were revealed, he was struck by \"how closely the imaginary character I'd created resembled the real Ed Gein both in overt act and apparent motivation.\"\nCharacter overview.\nBoth the 1959 novel and its 1960 film adaptation explain that Norman suffered severe emotional abuse as a child at the hands of his mother, Norma, who preached to him that sexual intercourse was sinful and that all women (except herself) were whores. The novel also suggests that their relationship may have been incestuous.\nAfter Norman's father died, Norman and his mother lived alone together \"as if there was no one else in the world\" until Norman was a teenager, when his mother met Joe Considine (Chet Rudolph in \"Psycho IV: The Beginning\") and planned to marry. Considine eventually convinced Norma to open a motel. Driven over the edge with jealousy, Norman murdered both of them with strychnine. After committing the murders, Norman forged his mother's suicide note to make it look like she had killed Considine and then herself. After a brief hospitalization for shock, he developed a split personality, assuming his mother's personality to repress his awareness of her death and thus escape the guilt of murdering her. He inherited his mother's house\u2014where he kept her corpse in the fruit cellar\u2014and the motel in the fictional small town of Fairvale, California.\nNorman's \"Mother\" personality is as cruel and possessive as the real Norma had been in life, frequently berating him and forbidding him to have a life outside of her. As \"Mother\", he dresses in Norma's clothes and talks to himself in her voice, and he also speaks to her corpse as if it is alive. \"Mother\" also kills women whom Norman feels attracted to, and anyone else who threatens the illusion of her existence. Norman passes out when \"Mother\" takes control; after \"Mother\" commits a murder, Norman awakens and destroys the evidence, convinced that \"she\" alone is responsible for the crime.\nBloch sums up Norman's multiple personalities in his stylistic form of puns: \"Norman\", a child needing his mother; \"Norma\", a controlling, mean-spirited parent figure; and \"Normal\", a functional adult who goes through the motions of day-to-day life.\n\"Psycho\" (novel and film).\nIn Bloch's 1959 novel and the 1960 Hitchcock film, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a young woman on the run after stealing money from her employer, checks into the motel one night. Norman is smitten with her, and shyly asks her to have dinner with him in the house. \"Mother\" flies into a rage and threatens to kill Marion if Norman lets her in the house. Norman defies her and eats dinner with Marion anyway, but lashes out at her when she suggests that he institutionalize his mother. When Marion goes to her room to shower, Norman spies on her through a peephole he drilled in the wall. \"Mother\" takes control and stabs Marion to death (he beheads her in the novel). When Norman awakes to discover what he believes his mother has done, he sinks Marion's car\u2014with her corpse and the money in the trunk\u2014into a nearby swamp. As \"Mother\", he also murders Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), a private detective hired by Marion's employer, days later.\nNorman is finally caught when Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), arrive at the motel looking for her. When Norman figures out what they want, he knocks Sam out and goes running after Lila, who has reached the house and found Mrs. Bates' corpse. He attacks her as \"Mother\", but Sam, after coming to, overpowers him, and Norman is finally arrested for murdering Marion and two other missing women. Norman is declared insane and sent to an institution, where \"Mother\" takes complete, and permanent, control of his mind: he becomes his mother.\nNovel sequels.\n\"Psycho II\".\nIn Bloch's 1982 sequel to his first novel, \"Psycho II\", Norman escapes from the psychiatric hospital by killing one of two visiting nuns and donning her habit. He steals their van and kills then rapes the corpse of the second nun. Norman plans to find and kill both Sam Loomis and his wife Lila (Lila Crane sister of Mary or Marion Crane) who he believes are responsible for his incarceration but first he needs to fake his death. \nHe notices a hitchhiker and decides to kill him and fake his own death. Unbeknown to Norman the hitchhiker is planning to attack this nun and steal her van. Norman tries to attack his passenger but is overpowered. This in turn causes a fiery accident where the hitchhiker escapes, but Norman dies. Meanwhile, Dr. Adam Claiborne, who discovered Norman's corpse, assumes his personality and goes on a killing spree.\n\"Psycho House\".\nIn Bloch's 1991 sequel to his second novel, \"Psycho House\", Norman appears only as a novelty animatronic on display in the Bates Motel, which has been converted into a tourist attraction.\n\"Psycho: Sanitarium\".\nIn the 2016 authorized novel \"Psycho: Sanitarium\" by Chet Williamson which takes place between Robert Bloch's novels \"Psycho\" and \"Psycho II\", it follows Norman Bates in the institute following the events of the original \"Psycho\" novel. He is under the care of Dr. Felix Reed, and there is an apparent revelation that Norman has a twin brother named Robert Newman who was separated from birth. It is revealed that Robert Newman was another split persona of Norman, manifested through manipulations by Felix Reed to try and have the mental health system overhauled. Norman ends up killing Felix Reed and subsequently falls into a catatonic state due to the trauma.\nFilm sequels.\n\"Psycho II\".\nIn 1983's \"Psycho II\", the first sequel to the original film, Norman is released from the institution twenty-two years after his arrest, seemingly cured. Sam Loomis has died at this point. Norman meets Mary Samuels (Meg Tilly)\u2014later revealed to be Mary Loomis, Lila and Sam Loomis's daughter and Marion Crane's niece\u2014and falls in love with her. However, a series of mysterious murders occurs, as well as strange appearances and messages from his mother, and Norman slowly loses his grip on sanity. The mysterious appearances and messages turn out to be a plot by Lila to drive him insane again in order to get him recommitted. The actual murders turn out to be the work of Norman's coworker, Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar). Before Norman discovers this, however, Mary Loomis is shot dead by the police during a confrontation with Norman, and Mrs. Spool murders Lila. When Spool tells Norman that she is his real mother, he kills her and embalms her corpse while assuming the \"Mother\" personality once again.\n\"Psycho III\".\nIn 1986's \"Psycho III\", set a month later, Norman continues to struggle, unsuccessfully, against \"Mother's\" dominion. He also finds another love interest named Maureen Coyle (Diana Scarwid), who eventually dies at \"Mother's\" hand. In the film, Mrs. Spool's corpse is first discovered by sleazy musician Duane Duke (Jeff Fahey), whom Norman kills when Duke tries to use the discovery to blackmail Norman. Tracy Venable (Roberta Maxwell), a reporter interested in Norman's case, finds out that Spool was in fact Norman's aunt\u2014Norma Bates' sister\u2014who was in love with Norman's father and killed him when he chose Norma over her. She then kidnapped the child Norman, believing him to be her own, but she was arrested and institutionalized, leaving Norman to be raised by Norma.\n\"Mother\" orders Norman to kill Tracy, but in the end he destroys Spool's corpse, attempting to break free of her control. He is then arrested and put back in the institution.\n\"Psycho IV: The Beginning\".\n\"\" (1990), the final film in the series, retcons the revelations of the second film and third film, supplying that Norman's father was stung to death by bees and removing all references to Emma Spool. In this film, Norman has been released from an institution, and is married to one of the hospital's psychologists, a woman named Connie (Donna Mitchell). When his wife becomes pregnant, he lures her to his mother's house and tries to kill her, wanting to prevent another of his \"cursed\" line from being born into the world; the film implies that Mrs. Bates (Olivia Hussey) suffered from schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder and passed the illnesses on to her son. However, he relents at the last minute, when Connie professes her love for him. He then burns the house down in an attempt to free himself of his past. During the attempt, he is tormented by hallucinations of \"Mother\" and several of his victims, becoming injured in a fall. He almost dies in the flames before willing himself to get out, apparently defeating his illness at long last; he is finally free of his mother's voice, which demands to be let out. This was Anthony Perkins' final performance as Norman Bates; Henry Thomas portrayed Norman as a teenager.\nTelevision.\n\"Bates Motel\" (film).\nIn the 1987 television spin-off movie and series pilot \"Bates Motel\", Norman is never released from the institution after his first incarceration. He befriends Alex West (Bud Cort), a fellow inmate who had murdered his stepfather, and wills ownership of the titular motel to him before dying of old age.\n\"Bates Motel\" (TV series).\nThe television series \"Bates Motel\", a reboot to the 1960 film \"Psycho\", set in the present day, depicts the young Norman Bates' life with his mother, Norma (Vera Farmiga). In this continuity, Norman suffers from hallucinations and blackouts, and begins manifesting his \"Mother\" personality while Norma is alive. He kills his abusive father, Sam (David Cubitt), while in a dissociative state, and Norma moves them from Arizona, where he was born and raised, to White Pine Bay, Oregon, to protect him. The series also introduces his maternal half-brother, Dylan Massett (Max Thieriot) and gives him a love interest in Emma Decody (Olivia Cooke), a classmate with cystic fibrosis.\nAs \"Mother\", Norman murders Blaire Watson (Keegan Connor Tracy), one of his teachers who seduces him; Bradley Martin (Nicola Peltz), a girl he has feelings for; and Audrey Ellis Decody (Karina Logue), Emma's estranged mother. Fearing for his sanity, Norma briefly has him committed to a mental institution. While there, Norman recovers a memory of witnessing his father rape Norma in a drunken rage after she tried to leave him; it is implied that this trauma fractured his psyche.\nWhen Norman's sanity begins to deteriorate, Norma marries the town sheriff, Alex Romero (Nestor Carbonell), so she can use his insurance coverage to pay for Norman's treatment. While the marriage is at first merely a financial arrangement, they eventually fall in love. After Norman is released from the institution and finds out that Norma is married, he grows insanely jealous and tries to kill both Norma and himself by flooding the house with carbon monoxide while his mother sleeps. Romero arrives at the house in time to revive Norman, but finds that Norma is already dead. Romero figures out what happened and swears revenge, but is arrested for perjury before he can do anything. Meanwhile, Norman cannot bear losing his mother, so he digs up her corpse and assumes her personality to preserve the illusion of her being alive.\nTwo years later, Norman is running the motel and living alone in the house with Norma's corpse, which he keeps frozen and preserved in the cellar. He and his \"Mother\" personality live together as if there is no one else in the world, and she takes care of his problems - such as killing and disposing of a hitman sent by Romero and helping him get rid of his uncle, Norma's brother Caleb (Kenny Johnson), after he discovers the truth. Norman falls for Madeline Loomis (Isabelle McNally), a lonely woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to Norma, and whose husband Sam (Austin Nichols) is cheating on her. \"Mother\" becomes jealous and starts behaving erratically, at one point taking possession of Norman's mind and making him have sex with a man at a gay bar while dressed in Norma's clothes. Norman finally begins to suspect that \"Mother\" is not real, and she confirms that he created her in his mind to deal with things that he could not, such as his abusive father.\nWhen Sam's mistress Marion Crane (Rihanna) checks into the motel, Norman has dinner with her and tells her that Sam is married. Marion comes back to the motel after confirming Sam's infidelity, and seeks comfort from Norman. He fears that \"Mother\" will kill her, however, and tells her to leave and never come back. When Sam comes to the motel to look for Marion, Norman stabs him to death in the shower.\nDylan comes to see Norman after learning of Norma's death, and they get into a fight that ends with Norman assaulting his half-brother at \"Mother's\" instigation. Terrified of what he might do, Norman calls 911 and confesses to murdering Sam. While he is in jail, Sheriff Jane Greene (Brooke Smith) finds the bodies of Norman's other victims, and charges him with their murders, as well. While Norman is awaiting trial, Romero\u2014who had earlier escaped from prison\u2014breaks into his cell and takes him hostage. They drive to the woods where Norman hid Norma's corpse after the police began searching his house. There, Norman gets the better of Romero and shoots him dead, but not before his former stepfather tells him he will never escape from murdering his own mother. When Norman finally admits to himself that he killed Norma, \"Mother\" appears to him and tells him she is leaving, as there is no longer anything she can protect him from.\nNow completely alone, Norman loses all contact with reality. He calls Dylan and invites him over for a \"family dinner\", complete with Norma's corpse seated at the head of the table. When Dylan tells him that Norma is dead, Norman flies into a rage and attacks him with a knife, forcing Dylan to shoot him in self-defense. As he dies, Norman sees a vision of his mother embracing him.\nCharacterization.\nThe character Norman Bates in \"Psycho\" was loosely based on two people. First was the real-life murderer Ed Gein, about whom Bloch later wrote a fictionalized account, \"The Shambles of Ed Gein\", in 1962. (The story can be found in \"Crimes and Punishments: The Lost Bloch, Volume 3\"). Second, it has been indicated by several people, including Noel Carter (wife of Lin Carter) and Chris Steinbrunner, as well as allegedly by Bloch himself, that Norman Bates was partly based on Calvin Beck, publisher of \"Castle of Frankenstein\".\nThe characterization of Norman Bates in the novel and the movie differ in some key areas. In the novel, Norman is forty, short, overweight and homely. In the movie, he is in his mid-20s, tall, slender, and handsome. Reportedly, when working on the film, Hitchcock decided that he wanted audiences to be able to sympathize with Norman and genuinely like the character, so he made him more of a \"boy next door\". In the novel, Norman becomes \"Mother\" after getting drunk and passing out; in the movie, he remains sober before switching personalities. \nIn the novel, Norman is well-read in occult and esoteric authors such as P.D. Ouspensky and Aleister Crowley. He is aware that \"Mother\" disapproves of these authors as being against religion.\nPortrayals.\nNorman Bates was portrayed by Anthony Perkins in Hitchcock's seminal 1960 film adaptation of Bloch's novel and its three sequels. Perkins hosted an episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1976 in which he performed numerous sketches portraying Norman, including the instructional video \"The Norman Bates School of Motel Management\". He also portrayed Norman, albeit more lightheartedly, in a 1990 commercial for Oatmeal Crisp cereal. Vince Vaughn portrayed Norman in Gus Van Sant's 1998 version of \"Psycho\", while Kurt Paul, Perkins' \"Mother\" stunt double in \"Psycho II\" and \"Psycho III\", took on the role in the made-for-TV film spin-off \"Bates Motel\". Perkins' son Oz portrayed a younger version of Norman in \"Psycho II\". Henry Thomas played a younger version of the character in \"\". Freddie Highmore portrayed Norman in the TV series \"Bates Motel\", with Vera Farmiga portraying both Norman's mother Norma and his murderous split personality \"Mother\". For his performance, Highmore was nominated twice for a Critic's Choice Award, a Saturn Award, and won a People's Choice Award in 2017.\nComic books.\nNorman appears in the 1992 three-issue comic book adaptation of the 1960 film \"Psycho\" released by Innovation Publishing. Despite being a colorized adaptation of the Hitchcock film, the version of Norman present in the comics resembles the one from Bloch's original novel: a middle-aged, overweight, balding man. Comic artist Felipe Echevarria has explained that this was due to Perkins' refusal to allow his likeness to be replicated for the books, wanting to disassociate himself with Norman Bates.\nReception.\nNorman Bates is ranked as the second-greatest villain on the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 film heroes and villains, behind Hannibal Lecter and ahead of Darth Vader. His line \"A boy's best friend is his mother\" also ranks as number 56 on the institute's list of the 100 greatest movie quotes. In 2008, Norman Bates was selected by \"Empire\" as one of \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\". In 2009, \"Total Film\" issued its \"The 150 Greatest Performances of All Time\" list, ranking Perkins' performance in \"Psycho\" at 27th place. Bates also ranked number 4 on \"Premiere\" magazine's list of \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He grew estranged from his parents, King George and Queen Caroline. Frederick was the father of King George III.\nUnder the Act of Settlement passed by the English Parliament in 1701, Frederick was fourth in the line of succession to the British throne at birth, after his great-grandmother Electress Sophia of Hanover; his grandfather George, Prince-Elector of Hanover; and his father, George. The Elector ascended the British throne in 1714. After his paternal grandfather died and his father became king in 1727, Frederick moved to Great Britain and was created Prince of Wales in 1729. He predeceased his father and upon the latter's death in 1760, the throne passed to Frederick's eldest son, George III.\nEarly life.\nFrederick was born on 31 January\u00a0[O.S. 20 January]\u00a01707 in Hanover, Holy Roman Empire (Germany), as Duke Friedrich Ludwig of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, to Caroline of Ansbach and Prince George, son of George, Elector of Hanover (who was also one of Frederick's two godfathers). The Elector was the son of Sophia of Hanover, who was heir presumptive to Queen Anne of Great Britain. However, in June 1714, Sophia died at the age of 83 before Anne, which elevated the Elector to heir presumptive. Queen Anne died on 1 August the same year, so the Elector became King George I. This made Frederick's father first-in-line to the British throne and Frederick himself second-in-line. Frederick's other godfather was his granduncle Frederick I, King in Prussia and Elector of Brandenburg-Prussia. Within the family, Frederick was nicknamed \"Griff\".\nIn the year of Anne's death and the coronation of George I, Frederick's parents, George, Prince of Wales (later George II), and Caroline of Ansbach, were called upon to leave Hanover for Great Britain when Frederick was only 7 years old. He was left in the care of his granduncle Ernest Augustus, Prince-Bishop of Osnabr\u00fcck, and did not see his parents again for 14 years.\nIn 1722, Frederick was inoculated against smallpox by Charles Maitland on the instructions of his mother, Caroline. His grandfather George I created him Duke of Edinburgh, Marquess of the Isle of Ely, Earl of Eltham in the county of Kent, Viscount of Launceston in the county of Cornwall, and Baron of Snaudon in the county of Carnarvon, on 26 July 1726. The latter two titles have been interpreted differently since: the \"of\"s are omitted and \"Snaudon\" rendered as \"Snowdon\".\nFrederick arrived in Great Britain in 1728, the year after his father had become King George II. By then, George and Caroline had several younger children, and Frederick was a high-spirited young man fond of drinking, gambling and women. The long separation had damaged the relationship with his parents, and they would never be close to him. That year also saw the foundation of Fredericksburg, Virginia, which was named after him.\nPrince of Wales.\nThe motives for the ill-feeling between Frederick and his parents may have included the fact that he had been set up by his grandfather, even as a small child, as the representative of the House of Hanover, and was used to presiding over official occasions in the absence of his parents. He was not permitted to go to Great Britain until after his father took the throne as George II on 11 June 1727. Frederick had continued to be known as Prince Friedrich Ludwig of Hanover (with his British HRH style) even after his father had been created Prince of Wales.\nFrederick was created Prince of Wales on 7 January 1729. He served as the tenth chancellor of the University of Dublin from 1728 to 1751, and a portrait of him still enjoys a commanding position in the Hall of Trinity College Dublin.\nOnce established in London, Frederick sponsored a court of 'opposition' politicians. They supported the Opera of the Nobility in Lincoln's Inn Fields as a rival to George Frideric Handel's royally sponsored opera at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket. His circle also backed opposition journalism and historiography: under the patronage of Chesterfield and George Bubb Dodington, the Country-Whig paper \"Old England; or, the Constitutional Journal\" was paired with two large histories\u2014William Guthrie\u2019s \"A General History of England\" (to 1688) and James Ralph\u2019s \"The History of England, During the Reigns of King William, Queen Anne, and King George I\" (1744\u201346).\nFrederick was a lover of music who played the viola and cello; he is depicted playing a cello in three portraits by Philippe Mercier of Frederick and his sisters. He enjoyed the natural sciences and the arts, and became a thorn in the side of his parents, making a point of opposing them in everything, according to the court gossip Lord Hervey. At court, the favourite of George II and Queen Caroline was Frederick's younger brother, Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, to the extent that the king looked into ways of splitting his domains so that Frederick would succeed only in Britain, while Hanover would go to William.\nHervey and Frederick (using a pseudonym \"Captain Bodkin\") wrote a theatrical comedy which was staged at the Drury Lane Theatre in October 1731. It was panned by the critics, and even the theatre's manager thought it so bad that it was unlikely to play out even the first night. He had soldiers stationed in the audience to maintain order, and when the play flopped, the audience were given their money back. Hervey and Frederick also shared a mistress, Anne Vane, who had a son called FitzFrederick Vane in June 1732. Either of them or William Stanhope, 1st Earl of Harrington, another of her lovers, could have been the father. Jealousy between Frederick and Hervey may have contributed to a breach, and their friendship ended. Hervey later wrote bitterly that Frederick was \"false\u00a0... never having the least hesitation in telling any lie that served his present purpose.\"\nPatron of the arts.\nA permanent result of Frederick's patronage of the arts is \"Rule, Britannia!\", one of the best-known British patriotic songs. It was composed by the English composer Thomas Arne with words written by the Scottish poet and playwright James Thomson as part of the masque \"Alfred\", which was first performed on 1 August 1740 at Cliveden. Thomas Arne was also one of Frederick's favourite artists. A masque linking the prince with both the Saxon hero-king Alfred the Great's victories over the Vikings and with the contemporary issue of building up British sea power accorded well with Frederick's political plans and aspirations. Later, the song gained a life of its own outside of the masque. Thomson, who supported the Prince of Wales politically, also dedicated an earlier work dedicated to him: \"Liberty\" (1734). \nUnlike the king, Frederick was a knowledgeable amateur of painting, patronising immigrant artists such as Jacopo Amigoni and Jean-Baptiste van Loo, who painted the portraits of the prince and his consort for Frederick's champion William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath. The list of other artists whom he employed\u2014Philippe Mercier, John Wootton, George Knapton, and the engraver Joseph Goupy\u2014includes some of the principal painters of the English Rococo. The prince was also crucially important in furthering the popularity of the Rococo style in the decorative arts, with a clear predilection for French Huguenot craftsmen. He patronised silversmiths such as Nicolas Sprimont (1713\u20131771), \"toyshop\" owners such as Paul Bertrand, and also carvers and gilders. The most notable of the latter was Paul Petit (1729\u2013c. 1756) who first worked for the prince on William Kent's neo-Palladian state barge of 1732, which is still preserved in the National Maritime Museum. Petit worked on a handful of magnificent trophy frames in the Rococo style for Frederick, which are among the most significant remaining testaments to the prince's patronage of the decorative arts. One frame, made in 1748 for his namesake cousin Frederick the Great of Prussia, was especially lavish and represented the esteem in which the prince held his cousin. This suggests the prince identified with Frederick the Great's style of enlightened rule, more than that of his own father George II. Petit's frame contained a portrait of Frederick the Great painted by Antoine Pesne, and remains today in the British Royal Collection.\nNone of Frederick's homes are now left standing except for the country residence of Cliveden, which is in a much altered state. His London residences (Norfolk House, Carlton House, Leicester House, and Kew House or the White House) have all been demolished.\nDomestic life.\nNegotiations between George II and his first cousin and brother-in-law Frederick William I of Prussia on a proposed marriage between the Prince of Wales and Frederick William's daughter Wilhelmine were welcomed by Frederick even though the couple had never met. George II was not keen on the proposal but continued talks for diplomatic reasons. Frustrated by the delay, Frederick sent an envoy of his own to the Prussian court. When George II discovered the plan, he immediately arranged for Frederick to leave Hanover for England. The marriage negotiations floundered when Frederick William demanded that Frederick be made Regent in Hanover.\nFrederick also almost married Lady Diana Spencer, daughter of Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland and Lady Anne Churchill. Lady Diana was the favourite grandchild of the powerful Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough. The duchess sought a royal alliance by marrying Lady Diana to the Prince of Wales with a massive dowry of \u00a3100,000. The prince, who was in great debt, agreed to the proposal, but the plan was vetoed by Robert Walpole and the king. Lady Diana soon married John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford.\nAlthough in his youth he was a spendthrift and womaniser, Frederick settled down following his marriage to the sixteen-year-old Augusta of Saxe-Gotha on 27 April 1736. The wedding was held at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace in London, presided over by Edmund Gibson, Bishop of London and Dean of the Chapel Royal. Handel provided the new anthem 'Sing unto God' for the service, and the wedding was also marked in London by two rival operas, Handel's \"Atalanta\" and Porpora's \"La festa d'Imeneo\".\nIn May 1736, George II returned to Hanover, which was unpopular in England. A satirical notice was pinned to the gates of St James's Palace decrying his absence: \"Lost or strayed out of this house\", it read, \"a man who has left a wife and six children on the parish.\" The King made plans to return, in the face of inclement weather; when his ship was caught in a storm, gossip swept London that he had drowned. Eventually, in January 1737, he arrived back in England. Immediately he fell ill, with piles and a fever, and withdrew to his bed. The Prince of Wales put it about that the King was dying, with the result that George insisted on getting up and attending a social event to disprove the gossip-mongers.\nQuickly accumulating large debts, Frederick relied for an income on his wealthy friend George Bubb Dodington. The prince's father refused to make him a financial allowance of the size that the prince considered should have been his. Frederick's public opposition to his father's government continued; he opposed the unpopular Gin Act 1736, which tried to control the Gin Craze. Frederick applied to Parliament for an increased financial allowance, and public disagreement over the payment of the money drove a further wedge between parents and son. Frederick's allowance was raised, but by less than he had asked for.\nIn June 1737, Frederick informed his parents that Augusta was pregnant, and was due to give birth in October. Traditionally, royal births were witnessed by members of the family and senior courtiers to guard against supposititious children. But in fact, Augusta's due date was earlier. When she went into labour in July, the Prince snuck her out of Hampton Court Palace in the middle of the night and forced her to ride in a rattling carriage to St James's Palace, so that the King and Queen could not be present at the birth. When they learned of the Prince's action, George and Caroline were horrified. With a party including two of her daughters and Lord Hervey, the Queen rushed to St James. There, Caroline was relieved to discover that Augusta had given birth to a \"poor, ugly little she-mouse\" rather than a \"large, fat, healthy boy\". That made a supposititious child unlikely, since the baby was so pitiful. The circumstances of the birth deepened the estrangement between mother and son.\nFrederick was banished from the king's court, and a rival court grew up at Frederick's new residence, Leicester House, where his father and mother had themselves lived after becoming estranged from George I. His mother fell fatally ill at the end of the year, but the king refused Frederick permission to see her. Frederick became a devoted family man, taking his wife and children to live in the countryside at Cliveden, where he fished, shot, and rowed. In 1742, Robert Walpole left office, and the realignment of the government led to a reconciliation between father and son, as Frederick's friends in Parliament gained influence.\nAfter the Jacobite Rising of 1745, Frederick met Flora MacDonald, who had been imprisoned in the Tower of London for aiding the escape of the Rising's leader Charles Edward Stuart, and helped to secure her eventual release. In 1747, Frederick rejoined the political opposition, and the king responded by dissolving Parliament. In the subsequent early general election, Frederick's allies lost.\nCricket.\nBy the time Frederick arrived in Great Britain, cricket had developed into the country's most popular team sport, and it thrived on gambling. Perhaps because he wished to anglicise and so fit in with society, Frederick developed an academic interest in cricket and soon became a genuine enthusiast. He began to make wagers and then to patronise and play the sport, even forming his own team on several occasions.\nThe earliest mention of Frederick in cricket annals is in a contemporary report of a match on 28 September 1731 between Surrey and London, played on Kennington Common. No post-match report was found despite advance promotion as \"likely to be the best performance of this kind that has been seen for some time\". The records show that \"for the convenience of the gamesters, the ground is to be staked and roped out\"\u00a0\u2013 a new practice in 1731 and possibly done partly for the benefit of a royal visitor. The advertisement refers to \"the whole county of Surrey\" as London's opponents and states that the Prince of Wales is \"expected to attend\".\nIn August 1732, the \"Whitehall Evening Post\" reported that Frederick attended \"a great cricket match\" at Kew on 27 July.\nBy the 1733 season, Frederick was seriously involved in the game, in effect as a county cricketer for Surrey. He was said to have given a guinea to each player in a Surrey vs. Middlesex game at Moulsey Hurst. Then he awarded a silver cup to a combined Surrey and Middlesex team which had just beaten Kent, arguably the best county team at the time, at Moulsey Hurst on 1 August. This is the first reference in cricket history to any kind of trophy (other than hard cash) being contested. On 31 August, the Prince of Wales XI played Sir William Gage's XI on Moulsey Hurst. The result is unknown but the teams were said to be of county standard, so presumably it was in effect a Surrey vs. Sussex match.\nIn the years following 1733, there are frequent references to the Prince of Wales as a patron of cricket and as an occasional player.\nWhen he died on 31 March 1751, cricket suffered a double blow as his death closely followed that of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, the game's greatest financial patron at the time. The number of top-class matches declined for several years.\nDeath.\nHis political ambitions unfulfilled, Frederick died at Leicester House at the age of 44 on 31 March 1751 (20 March OS). This had once been attributed to a burst lung abscess caused by a blow from a cricket or a real tennis ball, but it is thought to have been from a pulmonary embolism. He was buried at Westminster Abbey on 13 April 1751. He is the most recent Prince of Wales not to have acceded to the British throne.\nThe Prince of Wales's epigram (quoted by William Makepeace Thackeray, \"Four Georges\"):\n&lt;poem&gt;\n \"Here lies poor Fred who was alive and is dead,\n Had it been his father I had much rather,\n Had it been his sister nobody would have missed her,\n Had it been his brother, still better than another,\n Had it been the whole generation, so much better for the nation,\n But since it is Fred who was alive and is dead,\n There is no more to be said!\"\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThree months after his death, on 22 July, Augusta gave birth to their last child, Princess Caroline Matilda, who would later marry Christian VII of Denmark.\nTitles, honours and arms.\nBritish titles.\nHe was given the title Duke of Gloucester on 10 January 1717, but when he was raised to the peerage on 26 July 1726 it was as Duke of Edinburgh. He became Duke of Cornwall on 11 June 1727 and Prince of Wales on 7 January 1729.\nArms.\nBetween his creation as Duke of Edinburgh in 1726 and his creation as Prince of Wales, he bore the arms of the kingdom, differentiated by a \"label argent of three points, the centre point bearing a cross gules\". As Prince of Wales, the difference changed to simply a \"label argent of three points\". Frederick never succeeded his father as Treasurer of the Holy Roman Empire and so the red escutcheon in the centre of his Hanover quarter is empty.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

The band is best known for their 1997 hit \"Sex and Candy\".\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe band is named after the Marcy Open School in Minneapolis, which is the alternative school John Wozniak attended. He chose the name because many of his songs were inspired by his childhood. Marcy Playground emerged in the late 1990s. Influences include David Bowie, Paul Simon, Neil Young, Van Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd, Nirvana, Wham! and the Beatles. Frontman John Wozniak's first effort, \"Zog BogBean \u2013 From the Marcy Playground\", was self-produced, recorded in his bedroom studio with some help from his then-girlfriend Sherry Fraser and her brother Scott in the early nineties. A limited run of CDs were self-released by Wozniak. \"Our Generation\" and \"Dog and His Master\", two songs found on Wozniak's \"Zog BogBean\" project, would appear on later Marcy Playground albums. As of April 2009, \"Zog BogBean\" was available for download at Marcy Playground's official site as well as other outlets such as iTunes.\n\"Marcy Playground\" (1994\u20131998).\nAfter attending the Evergreen State College for two years, Wozniak moved east to New York, in order to work with multi-instrumentalist producer Jared Kotler, who John had known from suburban Philadelphia. Jared believed in John's songwriting talent and put together money with his cousin Jeff White in order to pay for and produce the duo, along with studio musician Glenn Braver(bassist) to record at Sabella Recording Studios in nearby Roslyn, New York. After hearing the two records worth of material Jared produced of John's songs, Capitol Records became interested in the music. Kurt Rosenwinkel, a mutual friend, introduced bassist Dylan Keefe to John Wozniak and Marcy Playground began performing in NYC. The band was signed to Capitol in 1995 and they performed a series of NYC club dates that would be the first incarnation of Marcy Playground as a band. Personal problems between John and Jared reached a peak after a year of playing the New York music scene and drummer Dan Rieser was brought in to replace Jared whose interest was producing other artists. The self-titled album was released in 1997, with the first single, \"Poppies\", released soon after. \nMarcy Playground emerged into the mainstream with the success of the single \"Sex and Candy\". The song spent 15 weeks at No.\u00a01 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album went platinum and managed to spawn two other singles, \"Saint Joe on the School Bus\" and \"Sherry Fraser\". \"Marcy Playground\" is quiet and minimalist in tone. Wozniak's songs run in different styles: some are modern folk music; many have undertones reminiscent of children's songs; the blurred sound of psychedelia makes appearances; and then there are the songs with a clear rock sound.\n\"Shapeshifter\" (1999\u20132000).\nMarcy Playground's next outing was 1999's \"Shapeshifter\". Shapeshifter was released on November 2, 1999.\nA minor controversy came to light when Paul Leary of the Butthole Surfers revealed on Marcy Playground's website forum that the cover art (a painting by Mark Ryden) had originally been conceptualized and commissioned by Leary for his band's aborted \"After the Astronaut\" album. He admitted to being a fan of Marcy Playground and Leary's outrage was eased once he learned that Capitol Records, former home of the Butthole Surfers and then-current home of Marcy Playground, had pitched the artwork to Wozniak as original work from its own art department and that Marcy Playground had no knowledge of the work's origins. Upon learning the truth, Wozniak proclaimed that he was \"honored\" to have an album cover designed by Paul Leary. \n\"It's Saturday\", the album's lead single, managed to hit No.\u00a023 on the Modern Rock Charts, and followed by a second single, \"Bye Bye\".\nAfter \"Shapeshifter,\" drummer Dan Rieser left the band to pursue other interests. The position was eventually filled on his recommendation by Gonzalo \"Gonz\" Martinez de la Cotera, a friend whose previous band Lincoln had opened for Marcy Playground.\n\"MP3\" (2004\u20132006).\nAfter a considerable hiatus, Marcy Playground recorded a follow-up to \"Shapeshifter\". Marcy Playground's third album, \"MP3\", was released in 2004.\nMarcy Playground did some touring in support of \"MP3\". The album's first single, \"Deadly Handsome Man\", was a song featured on the \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" movie soundtrack a few years earlier under its original title, \"The Devil's Song\". The second single, \"Punk Rock Superstar\", surprised many fans while bringing in some new ones, when it was featured on the Xbox 360's playlist upon its release in 2006. Other singles from the album include \"Blood in Alphabet Soup\" and \"No One's Boy\"; both were featured on promotional ads for \"MP3\". One album track, \"Paper Dolls\", was co-written by Jimi Haha of the alternative rock band Jimmie's Chicken Shack.\nOn the track titled \"Hotter Than the Sun\", Wozniak reflects on the band's one-time success and remains positive about the band's future.\n\"Leaving Wonderland...in a Fit of Rage\" (2009).\nMarcy Playground's fourth album, \"Leaving Wonderland... in a Fit of Rage\", was released on July 7, 2009. Originally conceived as a solo record by John Wozniak, he brought Dylan Keefe into the project and the record was released under the band's name. \"Leaving Wonderland\" features 12 songs, including the singles \"Good Times\" and \"Blackbird\". Also included on the record is a version of \"Memphis\", a Marcy Playground B-side that Wozniak's wife felt deserved a second breath of life. Sherry Fraser, Wozniak's longtime friend and lead vocalist of Two Ton Boa (a.k.a. 222), designed the album cover. \"Leaving Wonderland\" was coproduced, recorded and mixed by Jeff Dawson.\nAfter Gonzalo Martinez's departure from the band, Electro Morocco drummer Shlomi Lavie stepped in for the band's 2009 tour. Lavie, an Israeli-American, was referred to lead singer John Wozniak by bassist Dylan Keefe's wife, who is one of Shlomi's best friends.. After a successful 4-day Carnival Cruise show in the Bahamas alongside post-grunge band Sponge, it was announced that the band would tour for the spring of 2009, playing in venues along the California coastline, including the Key Club, as well as cities in Canada and North Carolina.\n\"Indaba Remixes from Wonderland\" (2010\u20132011).\nMarcy Playground's fifth album, \"Indaba Remixes from Wonderland,\" was released on September 28, 2010. \"Indaba Remixes from Wonderland\" is a new CD and digital collection of remixes from Marcy Playground's 2009 album \"Leaving Wonderland...in a fit of rage\". Marcy Playground partnered with Indaba Music to offer fans the opportunity to remix songs from the \"Leaving Wonderland\" album. Marcy Playground then selected its favorite mixes from hundreds submitted to be included on \"Indaba\". This is the first time Marcy Playground had an album produced exclusively from fan submitted remixes to Indaba Music where the winners received royalties from album sales.\nJohn Wozniak stated: \"I wanted to make this record to show people what the online music community is capable of. I believe the talent reflected in these tracks speaks for itself. This community is thriving. It's thriving because musicians feed on inspiration they get from other musicians. Music is not meant to be a solitary endeavor; it's something we like to do with other people.\"\nMarcy Playground was to tour many venues in support of the album through 2010.\n\"Lunch, Recess &amp; Detention\" (2012).\nMarcy Playground announced in mid-June 2012 that they will be releasing a compilation of rarities, B-sides, and new material on July 17, 2012 titled \"Lunch, Recess &amp; Detention\". The album's first single, \"Mr. Fisher\", was released on June 26, 2012. Marcy Playground joined Everclear, Sugar Ray, Lit, and the Gin Blossoms on the Summerland Tour 2012.\nBand members.\nCurrent\nFormer\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The label has released a variety of work in different genres, but it was originally known for its commitment to underground punk rock bands and the Olympia area music scene.\nHistory.\nSampson and Moon initially started the label because, in Moon's words, \"I just wanted to put out my friends' records because nobody was putting out my friends' records. And to put out spoken word 7-inch records.\" KRS-101 (the label's first release) was in fact a split 7-inch spoken-word record with Kathleen Hanna and Slim Moon; other \"Wordcore\" releases followed. The first major release was a compilation of Olympia-area bands simply titled \"Kill Rock Stars\" (\"Stars Kill Rock\" and \"Rock Stars Kill\" would follow in the same compilation series) and featured Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Unwound, Nirvana, Mecca Normal, Heavens to Betsy, The Nation of Ulysses, and the Melvins, among others.\nAlthough the label's music has never reflected a singular genre or underground music movement, it is arguably most notable for releasing the work of various riot grrrl bands during the mid-'90s, some of which, especially Bikini Kill, generated a good deal of press attention. Other Kill Rock Stars releases in this genre includes albums by Bratmobile, Huggy Bear, Heavens to Betsy and Excuse 17.\nThe label continued its tradition of spoken word by releasing their first full-length spoken-word LP \"Big Broad\" by Juliana Luecking in 1995. This was also the year that Elliott Smith released his self-titled solo LP on the label. Another milestone was the 1997 release of Sleater-Kinney's third LP (and first on Kill Rock Stars) \"Dig Me Out\", which garnered national press attention in \"Spin\" and \"Rolling Stone\".\nIn 1997\u201398, the 5RC label was formed as a sister label to Kill Rock Stars; it released generally harsher-sounding and more experimental rock than Kill Rock Stars. The 5RC roster included Xiu Xiu, Deerhoof, Need New Body, The Mae Shi, The Robot Ate Me, and Metalux, among others. 1998 also marked the first-ever Mailorder Freak Singles Club, featuring Quasi, Small Stars, Sta-Prest, and Rock*A*Teens, among others.\nAnother popular band on Kill Rock Stars was the Decemberists, who released three full-length albums on the label between 2001 and 2005. The band's singer, Colin Meloy, also released a solo album on the label in April 2008. Other notable releases by Kill Rock Stars include albums by the Paper Chase, Jeff Hanson, Unwound, Marnie Stern, the Gossip, Mecca Normal, Two Ton Boa and Comet Gain; spoken word albums by Kathy Acker and Miranda July; and reissues of work by earlier punk/post-punk bands such as Kleenex/Liliput, Essential Logic, and Delta 5.\nIn October 2006, Slim Moon, the label's owner, announced he would be departing Kill Rock Stars to work as an A&amp;R representative at Nonesuch Records, a Warner Music Group subsidiary. Moon's wife, Portia Sabin, then took over ownership of Kill Rock Stars. In 2007, the label released eleven records, including \"New Moon\", a collection of songs recorded by Elliott Smith between 1994 and 1997. The label has begun to further diversify its roster: since 2013, Kill Rock Stars has released albums by comedians including W. Kamau Bell, Nathan Brannon, Kurt Braunohler, River Butcher, Cameron Esposito, Emily Heller, Hot Tub with Kurt and Kristen, Ian Karmel, Hari Kondabolu, and Amy Miller.\nIn September 2019, Kill Rock Stars issued a press release announcing Slim Moon's return to management of the label after a thirteen-year hiatus, as well as the signing of Portland band MAITA; the press release described the signing as \"both previous label head Portia Sabin's last act and the first initiative of Slim Moon in his second tenure as guiding light of KRS\".\nIn February 2022, it was announced that independent music company Exceleration Music had acquired the Kill Rock Stars catalog and formed a partnership with its founder, Slim Moon. Under the deal, Moon would continue to handle A&amp;R and would be actively signing and developing new artists.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50677", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50677", "title": "Laser printing", "text": "Electrostatic digital printing process\nLaser printing is an electrostatic digital printing process. It produces high-quality text and graphics (and moderate-quality photographs) by repeatedly passing a laser beam back and forth over a negatively charged cylinder called a \"drum\" to define a differentially charged image. The drum then selectively collects electrically charged powdered ink (toner), and transfers the image to paper, which is then heated to permanently fuse the text, imagery, or both to the paper. As with digital photocopiers, laser printers employ a xerographic printing process. Laser printing differs from traditional xerography as implemented in analog photocopiers in that in the latter, the image is formed by reflecting light off an existing document onto the exposed drum.\nThe laser printer was invented at Xerox PARC in the 1970s. Laser printers were introduced for the office and then home markets in subsequent years by IBM, Canon, Xerox, Apple, Hewlett-Packard and many others. Over the decades, quality and speed have increased as prices have decreased, and the once cutting-edge printing devices are now ubiquitous.\nHistory.\nIn the 1960s, the Xerox Corporation held a dominant position in the photocopier market. In 1969, Gary Starkweather, who worked in Xerox's product development department, had the idea of using a laser beam to \"draw\" an image of what was to be copied directly onto the copier drum. After transferring to the recently formed Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC) in 1971, Starkweather adapted a Xerox 7000 copier to make SLOT (Scanned Laser Output Terminal). In 1972, Starkweather worked with Butler Lampson and Ronald Rider to add a control system and character generator, resulting in a printer called EARS (Ethernet, Alto Research character generator, Scanned laser output terminal)\u2014which later became the Xerox 9700 laser printer. In 1976, the first commercial implementation of a laser printer, the IBM 3800, was released. It was designed for data centers, where it replaced line printers attached to mainframe computers. The IBM 3800 was used for high-volume printing on continuous stationery, and achieved speeds of 215 pages per minute (ppm), at a resolution of 240 dots per inch (dpi). Over 8,000 of these printers were sold.\nSoon after, in 1977, the Xerox 9700 was brought to market. Unlike the IBM 3800, the Xerox 9700 was not targeted to replace any particular existing printers; however, it did have limited support for the loading of fonts. The Xerox 9700 excelled at printing high-value documents on cut-sheet paper with varying content (e.g., insurance policies). Inspired by the Xerox 9700's commercial success, Japanese camera and optics company Canon developed in 1979 the Canon LBP-10, a low-cost desktop laser printer. Canon then began work on a much-improved print engine, the Canon CX, resulting in the LBP-CX printer. Having no experience in selling to computer users, Canon sought partnerships with three Silicon Valley companies: Diablo Data Systems (who rejected the offer), Hewlett-Packard (HP), and Apple Computer.\nIn 1981, the first small personal computer designed for office use, the Xerox Star 8010, reached market. The system used a desktop metaphor that was unsurpassed in commercial sales, until the Apple Macintosh. Although it was innovative, the Star workstation was a prohibitively expensive (US$) system, affordable only to a fraction of the businesses and institutions at which it was targeted. Later, in 1984, the first laser printer intended for mass-market sales, the HP LaserJet, was released; it used the Canon CX engine, controlled by HP software. The LaserJet was quickly followed by printers from Brother Industries, IBM, and others. First-generation machines had large photosensitive drums, of circumference greater than the loaded paper's length. Once faster-recovery coatings were developed, the drums could touch the paper multiple times in a pass, and therefore be smaller in diameter. A year later, Apple introduced the LaserWriter (also based on the Canon CX engine), but used the newly released PostScript page-description language (up until this point, each manufacturer used its own proprietary page-description language, making the supporting software complex and expensive). PostScript allowed the use of text, fonts, graphics, images, and color largely independent of the printer's brand or resolution. PageMaker, developed by Aldus for the Macintosh and LaserWriter, was also released in 1985 and the combination became very popular for desktop publishing.\nLaser printers brought exceptionally fast and high-quality text printing in multiple fonts on a page, to the business and home markets. No other commonly available printer during this era could also offer this combination of features.\nPrinting process.\nA laser beam projects an image of the page to be printed onto an electrically charged, photoconductive, rotating, cylindrical drum. Photoconductivity conducts charged electrons away from the areas exposed to laser light. Powdered ink (toner) particles are then electrostatically attracted to remaining areas of the drum that have not been laser-beamed.\nThe drum then transfers the image onto paper which is passed through the machine by direct contact. Finally, the paper is passed onto a finisher, which uses heat to instantly fuse the toner that represents the image onto the paper.\nThe laser is typically an aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) semiconductor laser, which emits red or infrared light.\nThe drum is coated with selenium, or more recently, with an organic photoconductor made of N-vinylcarbazole, an organic monomer.\nThere are typically seven steps involved in the process, detailed in the sections below.\nRaster image processing.\nThe document to be printed is encoded in a page description language such as PostScript, Printer Command Language (PCL), or Open XML Paper Specification (OpenXPS). The raster image processor (RIP) converts the page description into a bitmap which is stored in the printer's raster memory. Each horizontal strip of dots across the page is known as a raster line or scan line.\nLaser printing differs from other printing technologies in that each page is always rendered in a single continuous process without any pausing in the middle, while other technologies like inkjet can pause every few lines. To avoid a buffer underrun (where the laser reaches a point on the page before it has the dots to draw there), a laser printer typically needs enough raster memory to hold the bitmap image of an entire page.\nMemory requirements increase with the square of the dots per inch, so 600 dpi requires a minimum of 4 megabytes for monochrome, and 16 megabytes for color (still at 600 dpi). For fully graphical output using a page description language, a minimum of 1 megabyte of memory is needed to store an entire monochrome letter- or A4-sized page of dots at 300 dpi. At 300 dpi, there are 90,000 dots per square inch (300 dots per linear inch). A typical 8.5 \u00d7 11 sheet of paper has margins, reducing the printable area to , or 84 square inches. 84 sq/in \u00d7 90,000 dots per sq/in = 7,560,000 dots. 1 megabyte = 1,048,576 bytes, or 8,388,608 bits, which is just large enough to hold the entire page at 300 dpi, leaving about 100 kilobytes to spare for use by the raster image processor.\nIn a color printer, each of the four CMYK toner layers is stored as a separate bitmap, and all four layers are typically preprocessed before printing begins, so a minimum of 4 megabytes is needed for a full-color letter-size or A4-size page at 300 dpi.\nDuring the 1980s, memory chips were still very expensive, which is why entry-level laser printers in that era always came with four-digit suggested retail prices in US dollars. The primitive microprocessors in early personal computers were so underpowered and insufficient for graphics work that attached laser printers usually had more onboard processing power. Memory prices later decreased significantly, while rapid improvements in the performance of PCs and peripheral cables (most importantly, SCSI) enabled the development of low-end laser printers which offload rasterization to the sending PC. For such printers, the operating system's print spooler renders the raw bitmap of each page into the PC's system memory at the target resolution, then sends that bitmap directly to the laser (at the expense of slowing down all other programs on the sending PC). The appearance of so-called \"dumb\" or \"host-based\" laser printers from NEC made it possible for the retail cost of low-end 300-dpi laser printers to decrease to as low as US$700 by early 1994 and US$600 by early 1995. In September 1997, HP introduced the host-based LaserJet 6L, which could print 600 dpi text at up to six pages per minute for only US$400.\n1200 dpi printers have been widely available in the home market since 2008. 2400 dpi electrophotographic printing plate makers, essentially laser printers that print on plastic sheets, are also available.\nCharging.\nIn older printers, a corona wire positioned parallel to the drum or, in more recent printers, a primary charge roller, projects an electrostatic charge onto the photoreceptor (otherwise named the photoconductor unit), a revolving photosensitive drum or belt, which is capable of holding an electrostatic charge on its surface while it is in the dark.\nAn AC bias voltage is applied to the primary charge roller to remove any residual charges left by previous images. The roller will also apply a DC bias on the drum surface to ensure a uniform negative potential.\nNumerous patents describe the photosensitive drum coating as a silicon \"sandwich\" with a photocharging layer, a charge leakage barrier layer, as well as a surface layer. One version uses amorphous silicon containing hydrogen as the light-receiving layer, boron nitride as a charge leakage barrier layer, as well as a surface layer of doped silicon, notably silicon with oxygen or nitrogen which at sufficient concentration resembles machining silicon nitride.\nExposing.\nA laser printer uses a laser because lasers are able to form highly focused, precise, and intense beams of light, especially over the short distances inside of a printer. The laser is aimed at a rotating polygonal mirror which directs the light beam through a system of lenses and mirrors onto the photoreceptor drum, writing pixels at rates up to sixty-five million times per second. The drum continues to rotate during the sweep, and the angle of sweep is canted very slightly to compensate for this motion. The stream of rasterized data held in the printer's memory rapidly turns the laser on and off as it sweeps.\nThe laser beam neutralizes (or reverses) the charge on the surface of the drum, leaving a static electric negative image on the drum's surface which will repel the negatively charged toner particles. The areas on the drum which were struck by the laser, however, momentarily have no charge, and the toner being pressed against the drum by the toner-coated developer roll in the next step moves from the roll's rubber surface to the charged portions of the surface of the drum.\nSome non-laser printers (LED printers) use an array of light-emitting diodes spanning the width of the page to generate an image, rather than using a laser. \"Exposing\" is also known as \"writing\" in some documentation.\nDeveloping.\nAs the drums rotate, toner is continuously applied in a 15-micron-thick layer to the \"developer roll\". The surface of the photoreceptor with the latent image is exposed to the toner-covered developer roll.\nToner consists of fine particles of dry plastic powder mixed with carbon black or coloring agents. The toner particles are given a negative charge inside the toner cartridge, and as they emerge onto the developer drum they are electrostatically attracted to the photoreceptor's latent image (the areas on the surface of the drum which had been struck by the laser). Because negative charges repel each other, the negatively charged toner particles will not adhere to the drum where the negative charge (imparted previously by the charge roller) remains.\nTransferring.\nA sheet of paper is then rolled under the photoreceptor drum, which has been coated with a pattern of toner particles in the exact places where the laser struck it moments before. The toner particles have a very weak attraction to both the drum and the paper, but the bond to the drum is weaker and the particles transfer once again, this time from the drum's surface to the paper's surface. Some machines also use a positively charged \"transfer roller\" on the backside of the paper to help pull the negatively charged toner from the photoreceptor drum to the paper.\nFusing.\nThe paper passes through rollers in the fuser assembly, where temperatures up to and pressure are used to permanently bond the toner to the paper. One roller is usually a hollow tube (heat roller) and the other is a rubber-backed roller (pressure roller). A radiant heat lamp is suspended in the center of the hollow tube, and its infrared energy uniformly heats the roller from the inside. For proper bonding of the toner, the fuser roller must be uniformly hot.\nSome printers use a very thin flexible metal foil roller, so there is less thermal mass to be heated and the fuser can more quickly reach operating temperature. If paper moves through the fuser more slowly, there is more roller contact time for the toner to melt, and the fuser can operate at a lower temperature. Smaller, inexpensive laser printers typically print slowly, due to this energy-saving design, compared to large high-speed printers where paper moves more rapidly through a high-temperature fuser with very short contact time.\nCleaning and recharging.\nAs the drum completes a revolution, it is exposed to an electrically neutral soft plastic blade that cleans any remaining toner from the photoreceptor drum and deposits it into a waste reservoir. A charge roller then re-establishes a uniform negative charge on the surface of the now-clean drum, readying it to be struck again by the laser.\nContinuous printing.\nOnce the raster image generation is complete, all steps of the printing process can occur one after the other in rapid succession. This permits the use of a very small and compact unit, where the photoreceptor is charged, rotates a few degrees and is scanned, rotates a few more degrees, and is developed, and so forth. The entire process can be completed before the drum completes one revolution.\nDifferent printers implement these steps in distinct ways. LED printers use a linear array of light-emitting diodes to \"write\" the light on the drum. The toner is based on either wax or plastic, so that when the paper passes through the fuser assembly, the particles of toner melt. The paper may or may not be oppositely charged. The fuser can be an infrared oven, a heated pressure roller, or (on some very fast, expensive printers) a xenon flash lamp. The warmup process that a laser printer goes through when power is initially applied to the printer consists mainly of heating the fuser element.\nMalfunctions.\nThe mechanism inside a laser printer is somewhat delicate and, once damaged, often impossible to repair. The drum, in particular, is a critical component: it must not be left exposed to ambient light for more than a few hours, as light is what causes it to lose its charge and will eventually wear it out. Anything that interferes with the operation of the laser such as a scrap of torn paper may prevent the laser from discharging some portion of the drum, causing those areas to appear as white vertical streaks. If the neutral wiper blade fails to remove residual toner from the drum's surface, that toner may circulate on the drum a second time, causing smears on the printed page with each revolution. If the charge roller becomes damaged or does not have enough power, it may fail to adequately negatively charge the surface of the drum, allowing the drum to pick up excessive toner on the next revolution from the developer roll and causing a repeated but fainter image from the previous revolution to appear down the page.\nIf the toner doctor blade does not ensure that a smooth, even layer of toner is applied to the developer roll, the resulting printout may have white streaks from this in places where the blade has scraped off too much toner. Alternatively, if the blade allows too much toner to remain on the developer roll, the toner particles might come loose as the roll turns, precipitate onto the paper below, and become bonded to the paper during the fusing process. This will result in a general darkening of the printed page in broad vertical stripes with very soft edges.\nIf the fuser roller does not reach a high enough temperature or if the ambient humidity is too high, the toner will not fuse well to the paper and may flake off after printing. If the fuser is too hot, the plastic component of the toner may smear, causing the printed text to look like it is wet or smudged, or may cause the melted toner to soak through the paper to the backside.\nDifferent manufacturers claim that their toners are specifically developed for their printers and that other toner formulations may not match the original specifications in terms of either tendency to accept a negative charge, to move to the discharged areas of the photoreceptor drum from the developer roll, to fuse appropriately to the paper, or to come off the drum cleanly in each revolution.\nPerformance.\nAs with most electronic devices, the cost of laser printers has decreased significantly over the years. In 1984, the HP LaserJet sold for $3500, had trouble with even small, low-resolution graphics, and weighed . By the late 1990s, monochrome laser printers had become inexpensive enough for home-office use, having displaced other printing technologies, although color inkjet printers (see below) still had advantages in photo quality reproduction. As of 2016[ [update]], low-end monochrome laser printers can sell for less than $75, and while these printers tend to lack onboard processing and rely on the host computer to generate a raster image, they nonetheless outperform the 1984 LaserJet in nearly all situations.\nLaser printer speed can vary widely, and depends on many factors, including the graphic intensity of the job being processed. The fastest models can print over 200 monochrome pages per minute (12,000 pages per hour). The fastest color laser printers can print over 100 pages per minute (6000 pages per hour). Very high-speed laser printers are used for mass mailings of personalized documents, such as credit card or utility bills, and are competing with lithography in some commercial applications.\nThe cost of this technology depends on a combination of factors, including the cost of paper, toner, drum replacement, as well as the replacement of other items such as the fuser assembly and transfer assembly. Often printers with soft plastic drums can have a very high cost of ownership that does not become apparent until the drum requires replacement.\nDuplex printing (printing on both sides of the paper) can halve paper costs and reduce filing volumes, albeit at a slower page-printing speed because of the longer paper path. Formerly only available on high-end printers, duplexers are now common on mid-range office printers, though not all printers can accommodate a duplexing unit.\nIn a commercial environment such as an office, it is becoming increasingly common for businesses to use external software that increases the performance and efficiency of laser printers in the workplace. The software can be used to set rules dictating how employees interact with printers, such as setting limits on how many pages can be printed per day, limiting usage of color ink, and flagging jobs that appear to be wasteful.\nColor laser printers.\nColor laser printers use colored toner (dry ink), typically cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK). While monochrome printers only use one laser scanner assembly, color printers often have two or more, often one for each of the four colors.\nColor printing adds complexity to the printing process because very slight misalignments known as registration errors can occur between printing each color, causing unintended color fringing, blurring, or light/dark streaking along the edges of colored regions. To permit a high registration accuracy, some color laser printers use a large rotating belt called a \"transfer belt\". The transfer belt passes in front of all the toner cartridges and each of the toner layers are precisely applied to the belt. The combined layers are then applied to the paper in a uniform single step.\nColor printers usually have a higher cost per page than monochrome printers, even if printing monochrome-only pages.\nLiquid electrophotography (LEP) is a similar process used in HP Indigo presses that uses electrostatically charged ink instead of toner, and using a heated transfer roller instead of a fuser, that melts the charged ink particles before applying them to the paper.\nColor laser transfer printers.\nColor laser transfer printers are designed to produce transfer media which are transfer sheets designed to be applied by means of a heat press. These transfers are typically used to make custom T-shirts or custom logo products with corporate or team logos on them.\n2-part Color laser transfers are part of a two-step process whereby the color laser printers use colored toner (dry ink), typically cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK); however, newer printers designed to print on dark T-shirts utilize a special white toner allowing them to make transfers for dark garments or dark business products.\nThe CMYK color printing process allows for millions of colors to be faithfully represented by the unique imaging process.\nBusiness-model comparison with inkjet printers.\nManufacturers use a similar business model for both low-cost color laser printers and inkjet printers: the printers are sold cheaply while replacement toners and inks are relatively expensive. A color laser printer's average running cost per page is usually slightly less, even though both the laser printer and laser toner cartridge have higher upfront prices, as laser toner cartridges print many more sheets relative to their cost than inkjet cartridges.\nThe print quality of color lasers is limited by their resolution (typically 600\u20131200 dpi) and their use of just four color toners. They often have trouble printing large areas of the same or subtle gradations of color. Inkjet printers designed for printing photos can produce much higher quality color images. An in-depth comparison of inkjet and laser printers suggest that laser printers are the ideal choice for a high quality, volume printer, while inkjet printers tend to focus on large-format printers and household units. Laser printers offer more precise edging and in-depth monochromatic color. In addition, color laser printers are much faster than inkjet printers, although being generally larger and bulkier.\nAnti-counterfeiting marks.\nMany modern color laser printers mark printouts by a nearly invisible dot raster, for the purpose of traceability. The dots are yellow and about in size, with a raster of about . This is purportedly the result of a deal between the US government and printer manufacturers to help track counterfeiters. The dots encode data such as printing date, time, and printer serial number in binary-coded decimal on every sheet of paper printed, which allows pieces of paper to be traced by the manufacturer to identify the place of purchase, and sometimes the buyer.\nDigital-rights advocacy groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation are concerned about this erosion of the privacy and anonymity of those who print. In particular, the tracking dots were implicated as a tool that directly lead to the arrest and conviction of whistleblower Reality Winner.\nSmart chips in toner cartridges.\nSimilar to inkjet printers, toner cartridges may contain smart chips that reduce the number of pages that can be printed with it (reducing the amount of usable ink or toner in the cartridge to sometimes only 50%), in an effort to increase sales of the toner cartridges. Besides being more expensive for printer users, this technique also increases waste, and thus increases pressure on the environment. For these toner cartridges (as with inkjet cartridges), reset devices can be used to override the limitation set by the smart chip. Also, for some printers, online walk-throughs have been posted to demonstrate how to use up all the ink in the cartridge. These chips offer no benefit to the end-user\u2014some laser printers used an optical mechanism to assess the amount of remaining toner in the cartridge rather than using a chip to electrically count the number of printed pages, and the chip's only function was as an alternate method to decrease the cartridge's usable life.\nSafety hazards, health risks, and precautions.\nToner clean-up.\nToner particles are formulated to have electrostatic properties and can develop static electric charges when they rub against other particles, objects, or the interiors of transport systems and vacuum hoses. Static discharge from charged toner particles can ignite combustible particles in a vacuum cleaner bag or cause a small dust explosion if sufficient toner is airborne. Toner particles are so fine that they are poorly filtered by conventional household vacuum cleaner filter bags and blow through the motor or back into the room.\nIf toner spills into the laser printer, a special type of vacuum cleaner with an electrically conductive hose and a high-efficiency (HEPA) filter may be needed for effective cleaning. These specialized tools are called \"ESD-safe\" (Electrostatic Discharge-safe) or \"toner vacuums\".\nOzone hazards.\nAs a normal part of the printing process, the high voltages inside the printer can produce a corona discharge that generates a small amount of ionized oxygen and nitrogen, which react to form ozone and nitrogen oxides. In larger commercial printers and copiers, an activated carbon filter in the air exhaust stream breaks down these noxious gases to prevent pollution of the office environment.\nHowever, some ozone escapes the filtering process in commercial printers, and ozone filters are not used at all in most smaller home printers. When a laser printer or copier is operated for a long period of time in a small, poorly ventilated space, these gases can build up to levels at which the odor of ozone or irritation may be noticed. A potential health hazard is theoretically possible in extreme cases.\nRespiratory health risks.\nAccording to a 2012 study conducted in Queensland, Australia, some printers emit sub-micrometer particles which some suspect may be associated with respiratory diseases. Of 63 printers evaluated in the Queensland University of Technology study, 17 of the strongest emitters were made by HP and one by Toshiba. The machine population studied, however, was only those machines already in place in the building and was thus biased toward specific manufacturers. The authors noted that particle emissions varied substantially even among the same model of machine. According to Professor Morawska of the Queensland University of Technology, one printer emitted as many particles as a burning cigarette:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; The health effects from inhaling ultrafine particles depend on particle composition, but the results can range from respiratory irritation to more severe illness such as cardiovascular problems or cancer.\nIn December 2011, the Australian government agency Safe Work Australia reviewed existing research and concluded that \"no epidemiology studies directly associating laser printer emissions with adverse health outcomes were located\" and that several assessments conclude that \"risk of direct toxicity and health effects from exposure to laser printer emissions is negligible\". The review also observes that, because the emissions have been shown to be volatile or semi-volatile organic compounds, \"it would be logical to expect possible health effects to be more related to the chemical nature of the aerosol rather than the physical character of the 'particulate' since such emissions are unlikely to be or remain as 'particulates' after they come into contact with respiratory tissue\".\nThe German Social Accident Insurance has commissioned a human study project to examine the effects on health resulting from exposure to toner dusts and from photocopying and printing cycles. Volunteers (23 control persons, 15 exposed persons and 14 asthmatics) were exposed to laser printer emissions under defined conditions in an exposure chamber. The findings from the study based on a broad spectrum of processes and subjects fail to confirm that exposure to high laser printer emissions initiates a verifiable pathological process resulting in the reported illnesses.\nA much-discussed proposal for reducing emissions from laser printers is to retrofit them with filters. These are fixed with adhesive tape to the printer's fan vents to reduce particle emissions. However, all printers have a paper output tray, which is an outlet for particle emissions. Paper output trays cannot be provided with filters, so it is impossible to reduce their contribution to overall emissions with retrofit filters.\nAir-transport ban.\nAfter the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot, in which shipments of laser printers with explosive-filled toner cartridges were discovered on separate cargo airplanes, the US Transportation Security Administration prohibited pass-through passengers from carrying toner or ink cartridges weighing over on inbound flights, in both carry-on and checked luggage. \"PC Magazine\" noted that the ban would not impact most travelers, as the majority of cartridges do not exceed the prescribed weight.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He published some poems and non-scientific work under the pseudonym Ernst. \nCareer.\nMatthias Jakob Schleiden was born in Hamburg. on 5 April 1804. His father was the municipal physician of Hamburg. Schleiden pursued legal studies \ngraduating in 1827. He then established a legal practice \nbut after a period of emotional depression and attempted suicide, he changed professions. The suicide attempt left a prominent scar across his forehead.\nHe studied natural science at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, but transferred to the University of Berlin in 1835 to study plants. Johann Horkel, Schleiden's uncle, encouraged him to study plant embryology. \nHe soon developed his love for botany and cats into a full-time pursuit. Schleiden preferred to study plant structure under the microscope. As a professor of botany at the University of Jena, he wrote \"Contributions to our Knowledge of Phytogenesis\" (1838), in which he stated that all plants are composed of cells. Thus, Schleiden and Schwann became the first to formulate what was then an informal belief as a principle of biology equal in importance to the atomic theory of chemistry. He also recognized the importance of the cell nucleus, discovered in 1831 by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown, and sensed its connection with cell division. In 1838, the two scientists M. J. Schleiden and Theodore Schwann formulated a theory about cellular structure which stated, 'All the living organisms are made up of cells and the cell is the fundamental component of living organismus\u201d. In 1885 Rudolf Virchow stated that all cells are formed from pre-existing cells.\nAlthough Schleiden was not Jewish nor a historian by profession, he was noted for his defense of Judaism and against antisemitism, and wrote two works, \"Die Bedeutung der Juden f\u00fcr die Erhaltung und Wiederbelebung der Wissenschaften im Mittelalter\" (1877) and \"Die Romantik des Martyriums bei den Juden im Mittelalter\" (1878), published in English as \"The Sciences among the Jews Before and During the Middle Ages\" and \"The Importance of the Jews for the Preservation and Revival of Learning during the Middle Ages\". \nHe became a professor of botany at the Imperial University of Dorpat in 1863. He concluded that all plant parts are made of cells and that an embryonic plant organism arises from one cell.\nHe died in Frankfurt am Main on 23 June 1881. \nEvolution.\nSchleiden was an early advocate of evolution. In a lecture on the \"History of the Vegetable World\" published in his book \"Die Pflanze und ihr Leben\" (\"The Plant: A Biography\") (1848) was a passage that embraced the transmutation of species. He was one of the first German biologists to accept Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. He has been described as a leading proponent of Darwinism in Germany.\nWith \"Die Pflanze und ihr Leben\", reprinted six times by 1864, and his \"Studien: Popul\u00e4re Vortr\u00e4ge\" (\"Studies: Popular Lectures\"), both written in a way that was accessible to lay readers, Schleiden contributed to creating a momentum for popularizing science in Germany.\nSchleiden\u2019s popular writings included two volumes of poetry which appeared under the pseudonym \u201cErnst\u201d in 1858 and 1873. American composer Harriet P.

{"id": "50679", "revid": "122189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50679", "title": "Dot matrix printing", "text": "Computer printing process\nDot matrix printing, sometimes called impact matrix printing, is a computer printing process in which ink is applied to a surface using a relatively low-resolution dot matrix for layout. Dot matrix printers are a type of impact printer that prints using a fixed number of pins or wires and typically use a print head that moves back and forth or in an up-and-down motion on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper. They were also known as serial dot matrix printers. Unlike typewriters or line printers that use a similar print mechanism, a dot matrix printer can print arbitrary patterns and not just specific characters.\nThe perceived quality of dot matrix printers depends on the vertical and horizontal resolution and the ability of the printer to overlap adjacent dots. 9-pin and 24-pin are common; this specifies the number of pins in a specific vertically aligned space. With 24-pin printers, the horizontal movement can slightly overlap dots, producing visually superior output (near letter-quality or NLQ), usually at the cost of speed.\nDot matrix printing is typically distinguished from non-impact methods, such as inkjet, thermal, or laser printing, which also use a bitmap to represent the printed work. These other technologies can support higher dot resolutions and print more quickly, with less noise. Unlike other technologies, impact printers can print on multi-part forms, allowing multiple copies to be made simultaneously, often on paper of different colors. They can also employ endless printing using continuous paper that is fanfolded and perforated so that pages can be easily torn from each other.\nHistory.\nIn 1925, Rudolf Hell invented the Hellschreiber, an early facsimile-like dot matrix\u2013based teletypewriter device, patented in 1929.\nBetween 1952 and 1954 Fritz Karl Preikschat filed five patent applications for his so-called \"PKT printer\", a dot matrix teletypewriter built between 1954 and 1956 in Germany. Like the earlier Hellschreiber, it still used electromechanical means of coding and decoding, but it used a start-stop method (asynchronous transmission) rather than synchronous transmission for communication. In 1956, while he was employed at Telefonbau und Normalzeit GmbH (TuN, later called Tenovis), the device was offered to the Deutsche Bundespost (German Post Office), which did not show interest.\nWhen Preikschat emigrated to the US in 1957 he sold the rights to utilize the applications in any country (except the USA) to TuN. The prototype was also shown to General Mills in 1957. An improved transistorized design became the basis for a portable dot matrix facsimile machine, which was prototyped and evaluated for military use by Boeing around 1966\u20131967.\nIn 1968, the Japanese manufacturer OKI introduced its first serial impact dot matrix printer (SIDM), the OKI Wiredot. The printer supported a character generator for 128 characters with a print matrix of 7 \u00d7 5. It was aimed at governmental, financial, scientific and educational markets. For this achievement, OKI received an award from the Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ) in 2013.\nIn 1970 Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) introduced an impact dot matrix printer, the LA30, as did Centronics (then of Hudson, New Hampshire): the Centronics 101. The search for a reliable printer mechanism led it to develop a relationship with Brother Industries, Ltd of Japan, and the sale of Centronics-badged Brother printer mechanisms equipped with a Centronics print head and Centronics electronics. Unlike Digital, Centronics concentrated on the low-end line printer marketplace with their distinctive units. In the process, they designed the parallel electrical interface that was to become standard on most printers until it began to be replaced by the Universal Serial Bus (USB) in the late 1990s.\nDEC was a major vendor, albeit with a focus on use with their PDP minicomputer line. Their LA30 30 character/second (CPS) dot matrix printer, the first of many, was introduced in 1970. In the mid-1980s, dot-matrix printers were dropping in price, and began to outsell daisywheel printers, due to their higher speed and versatility. The Apple ImageWriter was a popular consumer dot matrix printer in the 1980s until the mid-1990s.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, dot matrix impact printers were generally considered the best combination of cost and versatility, and until the 1990s were by far the most common form of printer used with personal and home computers.\nIncreased pincount of the printhead from 7, 8, 9 or 12 pins to 18, 24, 27, or 36 permitted superior print quality, which was necessary for success in Asian markets to print legible CJKV characters. Epson's 24-pin LQ-series rose to become the new de facto standard, at 24/180\u00a0inch (per pass \u2013 7.5\u00a0lpi). Not only could a 24-pin printer lay down a denser dot-pattern in a single pass, it could simultaneously cover a larger area and print more quickly. Although the text quality of a 24-pin was still visibly inferior to a true letter-quality printer such as a daisy wheel or laser printer, print quality was greatly superior to a 9-pin printer. As manufacturing costs declined, 24-pin printers gradually replaced 9-pin printers.\nBy the dawn of the 1990s, inkjet printers became more common as PC printers.\nDesign.\nDot matrix printing uses a print head that moves back-and-forth, or in an up-and-down motion, on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the print mechanism on a typewriter. However, unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced.\nEach dot is produced by a tiny metal rod, also called a \"wire\" or \"pin\", which is driven forward by the power of a tiny electromagnet or solenoid, either directly or through small levers (pawls). Facing the ribbon and the paper is a small guide plate named ribbon mask holder or protector, sometimes also called \"butterfly\" for its typical shape. It is pierced with holes to serve as guides for the pins. The plate may be made of hard plastic or an artificial jewel such as sapphire or ruby.\nThe portion of the printer that contains the pin is called the print head. When running the printer, it generally prints one line of text at a time. The printer head is attached to a metal bar that ensures correct alignment, but horizontal positioning is controlled by a band that attaches to sprockets on two wheels at each side which is then driven with an electric motor. This band may be made of stainless steel, phosphor bronze or beryllium copper alloys, nylon or various synthetic materials with a twisted nylon core to prevent stretching. Actual position can be found out either by dead count using a stepper motor, rotary encoder attached to one wheel, or a transparent plastic band with markings that is read by an optical sensor on the printer head (common on inkjets).\nBecause the printing involves mechanical pressure, dot matrix printers can create carbon copies and carbonless copies.\nAlthough nearly all inkjet, thermal, and laser printers also print closely spaced dots rather than continuous lines or characters, it is not customary to call them dot matrix printers.\nDot matrix printers have one of the lowest printing costs per page.\nThey are able to use fanfold continuous paper with tractor holes.\nDot matrix printers create noise when the pins or typeface strike the ribbon to the paper, and sound-damping enclosures may have to be used in quiet environments.\nThey can only print lower-resolution graphics, with limited color performance, limited quality, and lower speeds compared to non-impact printers.\nVariations.\nThe common serial dot matrix printers use a horizontally moving print head. The print head can be thought of featuring a single vertical column of seven or more pins approximately the height of a character box. In reality, the pins are arranged in up to four vertically or/and horizontally slightly displaced columns in order to increase the dot density and print speed through interleaving without causing the pins to jam. Thereby, up to 48 pins can be used to form the characters of a line while the print head moves horizontally. The printing speed of serial dot matrix printers with moving heads varies from 30 to 1550 characters per second (cps).\nIn a considerably different configuration, so called line dot matrix printers or line matrix printers use a fixed print head almost as wide as the paper path utilizing a horizontal line of thousands of pins for printing. Sometimes two horizontally slightly displaced rows are used to improve the effective dot density through interleaving. While still line-oriented, these printers for the professional heavy-duty market effectively print a whole line at once while the paper moves forward below the print head. Line matrix printers are capable of printing much more than 1000 cps, resulting in a throughput of up to 800 pages per hour.\nA variation on the dot matrix printer was the cross hammer dot printer, patented by Seikosha in 1982. The smooth cylindrical roller of a conventional printer was replaced by a spinning, fluted cylinder. The print head was a simple hammer, with a vertical projecting edge, operated by an electromagnet. Where the vertical edge of the hammer intersected the horizontal flute of the cylinder, compressing the paper and ribbon between them, a single dot was marked on the paper. Characters were built up of multiple dots.\nManufacturers and models.\nDEC.\nUnlike the LA30's 80-column, uppercase-only 5 x 7 dot matrix, DEC's product line grew. New models included:\nLA30.\nThe DECwriter LA30 was a 30 character per second dot matrix printing terminal introduced in 1970 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) of Maynard, Massachusetts.\nIt printed 80 columns of uppercase-only 7 \u00d7 5 dot matrix characters across a unique-sized paper. The printhead was driven by a stepper motor and the paper was advanced by a noisy solenoid ratchet drive. The LA30 was available with both a parallel interface (LA30-P) and a serial interface (LA30-S); however, the serial LA30 required the use of fill characters during the carriage-return. In 1972, a receive-only variation named LA30A became available.\nLA36.\nThe LA30 was followed in 1974 by the LA36, which achieved far greater commercial success, becoming for a time the standard dot matrix computer terminal. The LA36 used the same print head as the LA30 but could print on forms of any width up to 132 columns of mixed-case output on standard green bar fanfold paper. The carriage was moved by a much-more-capable servo drive using a DC electric motor and an optical encoder / tachometer. The paper was moved by a stepper motor. The LA36 was only available with a serial interface but unlike the earlier LA30, no fill characters were required. This was possible because, while the printer never communicated at faster than 30 characters per second, the mechanism was actually capable of printing at 60 characters per second. During the carriage return period, characters were \"buffered\" for subsequent printing at full speed during a catch-up period. The two-tone buzz produced by 60-character-per-second catch-up printing followed by 30-character-per-second ordinary printing was a distinctive feature of the LA36, quickly copied by many other manufacturers well into the 1990s. Most efficient dot matrix printers used this buffering technique.\nDigital technology later broadened the basic LA36 line into a wide variety of dot matrix printers.\nLA50.\nThe DEC LA50 was designed to be a \"compact, dot matrix\" printer. When in graphic mode (as opposed to text mode), the printhead can generate graphic images. When in (bitmap) graphics mode, the LA50 can receive and print Sixel graphics format.\nCentronics 101.\nThe Centronics 101 (introduced 1970) was highly innovative and affordable at its inception. Some selected specifications:\nIBM 5103.\nThe IBM 5103 was the only IBM printer that could be attached to the IBM 5100, an early day portable computer. Printing was 8 DPI, 10 pitch, 6 LPI, and capable of printing bidirectionally from a 128-character set. Two models were offered: 80 and 120 characters per second.\nNear Letter Quality (NLQ).\n\"Near Letter Quality\" mode\u2014informally specified as almost good enough to be used in a business letter\u2014endowed dot-matrix printers with a simulated typewriter-like quality. By using multiple passes of the carriage, and higher dot density, the printer could increase the effective resolution. In 1985, \"The New York Times\" described the use of \"\"near letter-quality,\" or NLQ\" as \"just a neat little bit of hype\" but acknowledged that they \"really show their stuff in the area of fonts, print enhancements and graphics.\"\nNLQ printers could generally be set to print in \"draft mode\", in which case a single pass of the print head per line would be used. This produced lower quality print at much higher output speed.\nPC usage.\nIn 1985, \"PC Magazine\" wrote \"for the average personal computer user dot matrix remains the most workable choice\". At the time, IBM sold Epson's MX-80 as their IBM 5152.\nAnother technology, inkjet printing, which uses the razor and blades business model (give away the razor handle, make money on the razor blade) has reduced the value of the low cost for the printer: \"a price per milliliter on par with liquid gold\" for the ink/toner.\nPersonal computers.\nIn June 1978, the Epson TX-80/TP-80, an 8-pin dot-matrix printer mainly used for the Commodore PET computer, was released. This and its successor, the 9-pin MX-80/MP-80 (introduced in 1979\u20131980), sparked the popularity of impact printers in the personal computer market. The MX-80 combined affordability with good-quality text output (for its time). Early impact printers (including the MX) were notoriously loud during operation, a result of the hammer-like mechanism in the print head. The MX-80's low dot density (60 dpi horizontal, 72\u00a0dpi vertical) produced printouts of a distinctive \"computerized\" quality. When compared to the crisp typewriter quality of a daisy-wheel printer, the dot-matrix printer's legibility appeared especially bad. In office applications, output quality was a serious issue, as the dot-matrix text's readability would rapidly degrade with each photocopy generation.\nPC software.\nInitially, third-party printer enhancement software offered a quick fix to the quality issue. General strategies were:\nSome newer dot-matrix impact printers could reproduce bitmap images via \"dot-addressable\" capability. In 1981, Epson offered a retrofit EPROM kit called Graftrax to add this to many early MX series printers. Banners and signs produced with software that used this ability, such as Broderbund's Print Shop, became ubiquitous in offices and schools throughout the 1980s.\nAs carriage speed increased and dot density increased (from 60 dpi up to 240 dpi), with some adding color printing, additional typefaces allowed the user to vary the text appearance of printouts. Proportional-spaced fonts allowed the printer to imitate the non-uniform character widths of a typesetter, and also darker printouts. 'User-downloadable fonts' gave until the printer was powered off or soft-reset. The user could embed up to two NLQ custom typefaces in addition to the printer's built-in (ROM) typefaces.\nContemporary use.\nThe desktop impact printer was gradually replaced by the inkjet printer. When Hewlett-Packard's &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;\u00a0 expired on steam-propelled photolithographically produced ink-jet heads in 2004, the inkjet mechanism became available to the printer industry. For applications that did not require impact (e.g. carbon-copy printing), the inkjet was superior in nearly all respects: comparatively quiet operation, faster print speed, and output quality almost as good as a laser printer. By 1995, inkjet technology had surpassed dot matrix impact technology in the mainstream market and relegated dot matrix to niche applications.\nAs of 2021[ [update]], dot matrix impact technology remains in use in devices and applications such as:\nThermal printing is gradually supplanting them in some of these applications, but full-size dot-matrix impact printers are still used to print multi-part stationery. For example, dot matrix impact printers are still used at bank tellers and auto repair shops, and other applications where use of tractor feed paper is desirable such as data logging and aviation. Most of these printers now come with USB interfaces as a standard feature to facilitate connections to modern computers without legacy ports.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50680", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50680", "title": "Funicular", "text": "Form of cable railway\nA funicular ( ), or funicular railway, is a type of cable railway system that connects points along a railway track laid on a steep slope. The system is characterized by two counterbalanced carriages (also called cars or trains) permanently attached to opposite ends of a haulage cable, which is looped over a pulley at the upper end of the track. The result of such a configuration is that the two carriages move synchronously: as one ascends, the other descends at an equal speed. This feature distinguishes funiculars from inclined elevators, which have a single car that is hauled uphill.\nThe term \"funicular\" derives from the Latin word , the diminutive of , meaning 'rope'.\nOperation.\nIn a funicular, both cars are permanently connected to the opposite ends of the same cable, known as a \"haul rope\"; this haul rope runs through a system of pulleys at the upper end of the line. If the railway track is not perfectly straight, the cable is guided along the track using sheaves \u2013 unpowered pulleys that simply allow the cable to change direction. While one car is pulled upwards by one end of the haul rope, the other car descends the slope at the other end. Since the weight of the two cars is counterbalanced (except for the difference in the weight of passengers), the engine only has to provide energy to pull the excess passengers in the uphill car and the cable itself, plus the energy lost to friction by the cars' wheels and the pulleys.\nFor passenger comfort, funicular carriages are often, although not always, constructed so that the floor of the passenger deck is horizontal rather than parallel to the sloped track.\nIn some installations, the cars may also be attached to a second cable \u2013 \"bottom towrope\" \u2013 which runs through a pulley at the bottom of the incline. In these designs, one of the pulleys must be designed as a tensioning wheel to avoid slack in the ropes. One advantage of such an installation is that the weight of the rope is balanced between the carriages; therefore, the engine no longer needs to use any power to lift the cable itself. This practice is used on funiculars with slopes below 6%, funiculars using sledges instead of carriages, or any other case where it is not ensured that the descending car is always able to pull out the cable from the pulley in the station on the top of the incline. It is also used in systems where the engine room is located at the lower end of the track (such as the upper half of the Great Orme Tramway) \u2013 in such systems, the cable that runs through the top of the incline is still necessary to prevent the carriages from coasting down the incline.\nTypes of power systems.\nCable drive.\nIn most modern funiculars, neither of the two carriages is equipped with an engine of its own; propulsion is provided by an electric motor in the engine room (typically at the upper end of the track), linked via a speed-reducing gearbox to a large pulley \u2013 a \"drive bullwheel\" \u2013 which then controls the movement of the haul rope using friction. Some early funiculars were powered in the same way, but using steam engines or other types of motors. The bullwheel has two grooves: after the first half turn around it the cable returns via an auxiliary pulley. This arrangement has the advantage of having twice the amount of contact area between the cable and the groove, and returning the downward-moving cable in the same plane as the upward-moving one. Modern installations use high-friction liners to increase the friction between the bullwheel grooves and the cable.\nThere are two sets of brakes in the engine room: an emergency brake which directly grips the bullwheel, and a service brake mounted at the high speed shaft of the gear. The cars are also equipped with spring-applied, hydraulically opened rail brakes for emergency use.\nThe first funicular caliper brakes which clamp each side of the crown of the rail were invented by the Swiss entrepreneurs Franz Josef Bucher and Josef Durrer and implemented at the Stanserhorn funicular, opened in 1893. The Abt rack and pinion system was also used on some funiculars for speed control or emergency braking.\nWater counterbalancing.\nMany early funiculars were built using water tanks under the floor of each car, which were filled or emptied until just sufficient imbalance was achieved to allow movement, and a few funiculars still operate that way. The car at the top of the hill is loaded with water until it is heavier than the car at the bottom, causing it to descend the hill and pull up the other car. The water is drained at the bottom, and the process repeats with the cars exchanging roles. The movement is controlled by a brakeman using the brake handle of the rack and pinion system engaged with the rack mounted between the rails.\nThe Bom Jesus funicular built in 1882 near Braga, Portugal, is an extant system of this type. Another example, the Fribourg funicular in Fribourg, Switzerland, built in 1899, is of particular interest as it utilizes waste water, coming from a sewage plant at the upper part of the city.\nSome funiculars of this type were later converted to electrical power. For example, the Giessbachbahn in the Swiss canton of Bern, opened in 1879, was originally powered by water ballast. In 1912 its energy provision was replaced by a hydraulic engine powered by a Pelton turbine, which in 1948 was replaced by an electric motor.\nTrack layout.\nThree main rail layouts are used on funiculars; depending on the system, the track bed can consist of four, three, or two rails.\nSome funicular systems use a mix of different track layouts. An example of this arrangement is the lower half of the Great Orme Tramway, where the section \"above\" the passing loop has a three-rail layout (with each pair of adjacent rails having its own conduit which the cable runs through), while the section \"below\" the passing loop has a two-rail layout (with a single conduit shared by both cars). Another example is the Peak Tram in Hong Kong, which is mostly of a two-rail layout except for a short three-rail section immediately uphill of the passing loop.\nSome four-rail funiculars have their tracks interlaced above and below the passing loop; this allows the system to be nearly as narrow as a two-rail system, with a single platform at each station, while also eliminating the need for the costly junctions either side of the passing loop. The Hill Train at the Legoland Windsor Resort is an example of this configuration.\nTurnout systems for two-rail funiculars.\nIn the case of two-rail funiculars, various solutions exist for ensuring that a carriage always enters the same track at the passing loop.\nOne such solution involves installing switches at each end of the passing loop. These switches are moved into their desired position by the carriage's wheels during trailing movements (i.e. away from the passing loop); this procedure also sets the route for the next trip in the opposite direction. The Great Orme Tramway is an example of a funicular that utilizes this system.\nAbt switch\nAnother turnout system, known as the \"Abt switch\", involves no moving parts on the track at all. Instead, the carriages are built with an unconventional wheelset design: the outboard wheels have flanges on both sides, whereas the inboard wheels are unflanged (and usually wider to allow them to roll over the turnouts more easily). The double-flanged wheels keep the carriages bound to one specific rail at all times. One car has the flanged wheels on the left-hand side, so it follows the leftmost rail, forcing it to run via the left branch of the passing loop; similarly, the other car has them on the right-hand side, meaning it follows the rightmost rail and runs on the right branch of the loop. This system was invented by Carl Roman Abt and first implemented on the Lugano Citt\u00e0\u2013Stazione funicular in Switzerland in 1886; since then, the Abt turnout has gained popularity, becoming a standard for modern funiculars. The lack of moving parts on the track makes this system cost-effective and reliable compared to other systems.\nStations.\nThe majority of funiculars have two stations, one at the top and one at the bottom of the track. However, some systems have been built with additional intermediate stations. Because of the nature of a funicular system, intermediate stations are usually built symmetrically about the mid-point; this allows both cars to call simultaneously at a station. Examples of funiculars with more than two stations include the Wellington Cable Car in New Zealand with five stations, including one at the passing loop, and the Carmelit in Haifa, Israel with six stations, three on each side of the passing loop.\nThere are a few funiculars with asymmetrically placed stations. For example, the Pet\u0159\u00edn funicular in Prague has three stations: one at each end, and a third (Neboz\u00edzek) a short way up from the passing loop. Because of this arrangement, when a car on one side stops at Neboz\u00edzek the car on the other side stops without a station access.\nHistory.\nA number of cable railway systems which pull their cars on inclined slopes were built since the 1820s. \nIn the second half of the 19th century the design of a funicular as a transit system emerged. \nIt was especially attractive in comparison with the other systems of the time as counterbalancing of the cars was deemed to be a cost-cutting solution.\nThe first line of the Funiculars of Lyon () opened in 1862, followed by other lines in 1878, 1891 and 1900. The Budapest Castle Hill Funicular was built in 1868\u201369, with the first test run on 23 October 1869. \nThe oldest funicular railway operating in Britain dates from 1875 and is in Scarborough, North Yorkshire.\nIn Istanbul, Turkey, the T\u00fcnel has been in continuous operation since 1875 and is both the first underground funicular and the second-oldest underground railway. \nIt remained powered by a steam engine up until it was taken for renovation in 1968.\nUntil the end of the 1870s, the four-rail parallel-track funicular was the normal configuration. Carl Roman Abt developed the Abt Switch allowing the two-rail layout, which was used for the first time in 1879 when the Giessbach Funicular opened in Switzerland.\nIn the United States, the first funicular to use a two-rail layout was the Telegraph Hill Railroad in San Francisco, which was in operation from 1884 until 1886. The Mount Lowe Railway in Altadena, California, was the first mountain railway in the United States to use the three-rail layout. Three- and two-rail layouts considerably reduced the space required for building a funicular, reducing grading costs on mountain slopes and property costs for urban funiculars. These layouts enabled a funicular boom in the latter half of the 19th century.\nCurrently, the United States' oldest and steepest funicular in continuous use is the Monongahela Incline located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Construction began in 1869 and officially opened 28 May 1870 for passenger use. The Monongahela incline also has the distinction of being the first funicular in the United States for strictly passenger use and not freight.\nIn 1880 the funicular of Mount Vesuvius inspired the Italian popular song \"Funicul\u00ec, Funicul\u00e0\". This funicular was destroyed repeatedly by volcanic eruptions and abandoned after the eruption of 1944.\nExceptional examples.\nAccording to the \"Guinness World Records\", the smallest public funicular in the world is the Fisherman's Walk Cliff Railway in Bournemouth, England, which is long.\nStoosbahn in Switzerland, with a maximum slope of 110% (47.7\u00b0), is the steepest funicular in the world.\nThe Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway, built in 1888, is the steepest and longest water-powered funicular in the world. It climbs vertically on a 58% gradient.\nThe city of Valpara\u00edso in Chile used to have up to 30 funicular elevators (). The oldest of them dates from 1883. 15 remain with almost half in operation, and others in various stages of restoration.\nThe Carmelit in Haifa, Israel, with six stations and a tunnel 1.8\u00a0km (1.1\u00a0mi) long, is claimed by the Guinness World Records as the \"least extensive metro\" in the world. Technically, it is an underground funicular.\nThe Dresden Suspension Railway (), which hangs from an elevated rail, is the only suspended funicular in the world.\nThe Fribourg funicular is the only funicular in the world powered by wastewater.\nStandseilbahn Linth-Limmern, capable of moving 215 t, is said to have the highest capacity.\nComparison with inclined elevators.\nSome inclined elevators are incorrectly called funiculars. On an inclined elevator the cars operate independently rather than in interconnected pairs, and are lifted uphill.\nA notable example is Paris' Montmartre Funicular. Its formal title is a relic of its original configuration, when its two cars operated as a counterbalanced, interconnected pair, always moving in opposite directions, thus meeting the definition of a funicular. However, the system has since been redesigned, and now uses two independently-operating cars that can each ascend or descend on demand, qualifying as a double inclined elevator; the term \"funicular\" in its title is retained as a historical reference.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A line matrix printer prints page-wide lines of dots at a time, building up a line of text by printing lines of dots.\nApplications.\nLine matrix printers are used for high-speed printing applications They are used to produce invoices, bank statements, product shipment and transportation documentation as well as product compliance labels.\nLine matrix printers can print text, bar codes and graphics.\nWhen implemented as impact printers, they can be the least expensive to operate per page.\nHow it works.\nDot matrix printers are widely used because of their low cost per page. Dot matrix printers are divided into two main groups: serial dot matrix printers and line matrix printers.\nA serial dot matrix printer has a print head that runs back and forth, or in an up and down motion, on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the print mechanism on a typewriter. However, unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced. Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create carbon copies and carbonless copies.\nBoth line matrix and serial dot matrix printers use pins to strike against the inked ribbon, making dots on the paper and forming the desired characters. The difference is that a line matrix printer uses a hammer bank (or print-shuttle) instead of print head. This print-shuttle has hammers instead of print wires, and these hammers are arranged in a horizontal row instead in vertical column. The hammer bank uses the same technology as the permanent magnet print head with the small difference that instead of print wires the print-shuttle has hammers.\nThe permanent magnetic field holds the hammer spring in stressed, ready to strike position. The driver sends electric current to hammer coil, which creates an electromagnetic field opposing the permanent magnetic field. When the two fields equalize, the energy stored in the spring is released to strike the hammer against the ribbon and print a dot on the paper.\nDuring the printing process the print-shuttle vibrates in horizontal direction with high speed while the print hammers are fired selectively. Each hammer prints a series of dots in horizontal direction for one pass of the shuttle, then paper advances at one step and the shuttle prints the following row of dots.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Pulled rickshaws have been replaced mainly by cycle rickshaws and auto rickshaws.\nOverview.\nRickshaws are commonly believed to have been invented in Japan in the 1860s, at the beginning of a period of rapid technical advancement. In the 19th century, rickshaw pulling became an inexpensive, popular mode of transportation across Asia.\nPeasants who migrated to large Asian cities often worked first as a rickshaw runner. It was \"the deadliest occupation in the East, [and] the most degrading for human beings to pursue.\"\nThe rickshaw's popularity in Japan declined by the 1930s with the advent of automated forms of transportation, like automobiles and trains. In China, the rickshaw's popularity began to decline in the 1920s. In Singapore, the rickshaw's popularity increased into the 20th century. There were approximately 50,000 rickshaws in 1920 and that number doubled by 1930.\nDescription.\nThe initial rickshaws rode on iron-shod wooden wheels and the passenger sat on hard, flat seats. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, rubber or pneumatic rubber tires, spring cushions, and backrests improved the passenger's comfort. Other features, such as lights, were also added.\nIn the city of Shanghai, public rickshaws were painted yellow to differentiate from the private vehicles of the wealthy citizens, which were described as:\n... always shiny, were carefully maintained, and sported 'a spotless white upholstered double seat, a clean plaid for one's lap, and a wide protective tarpaulin to protect the passenger (or passengers, since sometimes up to three people rode together) against the rain.\nThe rickshaws were a convenient means of travel, able to traverse winding, narrow city streets. During monsoon season, passengers might be carried out of the carriage, above the flooded streets, to the door of their arrival. They offered door-to-door travel, unlike scheduled public bus and tram service.\nCountry overview.\nAfrica.\nEast Africa.\nIn the 1920s, it was used in Bagamoyo and Tanga in Tanzania, and other areas of East Africa for short distances.\nMadagascar.\nRickshaws, known as \"pousse-pousse\", were introduced by British missionaries. The intention was to eliminate the slavery-associated palanquin. Its name pousse-pousse, meaning \"push-push\", is reportedly gained from the need to have a second person to push the back of the rickshaw on Madagascar's hilly roads. They are a common form of transport in a number of Malagasy cities, especially Antsirabe, but are not found in the towns or cities with very hilly roads. They are similar to Chinese rickshaws and are often brightly decorated.\nNairobi.\nRickshaws operated in Nairobi in the beginning of the 20th century; pullers went on strike there in 1908.\nSouth Africa.\nDurban is famous for its iconic Zulu rickshaw pullers navigating throughout the city. These colorful characters are famous for their giant, vibrant hats and costumes. They were introduced into Natal by Sir Marshall Campbell in the 1890s. There were about 2,000 registered men who pulled rickshaws in Durban in 1904. Since displaced by motorised transport, there are approximately 25 rickshaws left who mostly cater to tourists today.\nAsia.\nChina.\nIn China, from the ancient times and until the 19th century, rich and important people, when traveling overland, were commonly transported in sedan chairs carried by bearers, rather than in wheeled vehicles. This was at least partly explained by road conditions.\nIt is thought that it was from China (or East Asia in general) that sedan chair (a.k.a. \"palanquin\") designs were introduced into Western Europe in the 17th century.\n However, wheeled carts for one or two passengers, pushed (rather than pulled, like a proper rikshaw) by human servant, were attested as well.\nIn the 19th century, wheelbarrow is the most popular transportation for commoners. In the spring of 1873, the French merchant Menard introduced rickshaw from Japan. The original name is \"Jinrikisha\", meaning \"man-power-vehicle\" in Japanese. Most of the rickshaws were owned by foreign investors at the beginning, but in around the 1900s, rickshaws were owned mostly by Chinese companies. The official name for rickshaw is \"renliche\", meaning \"man-power-vehicle\" in Chinese, but it is more commonly called \"dongyangche\", meaning \"east-foreign-vehicle\", or \"huangbaoche\" in Shanghai, meaning \"yellow carriage for rent\".\nRickshaw transportation was an important element in urban development in 20th century China, as a mode of transportation, source of employment and facilitation of migration for workers. According to author David Strand:\nSixty thousand men took as many as a half million fares a day in a city of slightly more than one million. Sociologist Li Jinghan estimated that one out of six males in the city between the ages of sixteen and fifty was a puller. Rickshaw men and their dependents made up almost 20 percent of Beijing's population.\nMost manual rickshaws \u2013 seen by many Maoists as a symbol of oppression of the working class \u2013 were eliminated in China after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.\nShanghai.\nShanghai's rickshaw industry began in 1874 with 1,000 rickshaws imported from Japan. By 1914 there were 9,718 vehicles. The pullers were a large group of the city's working poor: 100,000 men pulled rickshaws by the early 1940s, up from 62,000 in the mid-1920s.\nIn contrary to coolies in Beijing, those in Shanghai mostly come from rural areas out of the city. With the destitution of their land, they poured into the city with their family. As the number of coolies rose up sharply, however, the number of rickshaw remained at 20,000 in Shanghai. Except private coolies, those for public work had to take turns, and thus their average income diminished to $9 per month. Therefore, many coolies worked in the factory and ran the rickshaw after work. However, many coolies were optimistic about life. They were satisfied about their income and dreamed of purchasing their own rickshaws and sending their kids to schools. Due to this low income, many coolies would not give customers a clear idea of standard price and thus charge higher at any chance they had. In response to this phenomenon, hotels would provide the distance to various streets and the price charged.\nHong Kong.\nRickshaws were first imported to Hong Kong from Japan in 1880. They were a popular form of transport for many years, peaking at more than 3,000 in the 1920s. However, their popularity waned after World War II. No new licenses for rickshaws have been issued since 1975, and only a few old men\u2014three as of 2017\u2014still hold a license. It is reported that only one of them still offer rickshaw rides on The Peak, mainly for tourists. But he retired in 2020.\nIndia.\nAround 1880, rickshaws appeared in India, first in Simla. At the turn of the century it was introduced in Kolkata (Calcutta), India and in 1914 was a conveyance for hire.\nService availability.\nThough most cities offer auto rickshaw service, hand-pulled rickshaws do exist in some areas, such as Kolkata, \"the last bastion of human powered \"tana\" rickshaws\". According to Trillin, most Kolkata rickshaws serve people \"just a notch above poor\" who tend to travel short distances. However, in a recent article by Hyrapiet and Greiner, the authors found that rickshaws also transport middle-class residents who use their services out of convenience and for short-distance trips to the local marketplace. Rickshaws are used to transport goods, shoppers, and school children. It is also used as a \"24-hour ambulance service.\" Also according to Hyrapiet and Greiner, rickshaw pullers have acted as peer-educators for the Calcutta Samaritans providing critical information on HIV/AIDS because of their access to marginalized groups within Kolkata's red light districts.\nRickshaws are the most effective means of transportation through the flooded streets of the monsoon season. When Kolkata floods rickshaw business increases and prices rise.\nThe pullers live a life of poverty and many sleep under rickshaws. Rudrangshu Mukerjee, an academic, stated many people's ambivalent feelings about riding a rickshaw: he does not like being carried about in a rickshaw but does not like the idea of \"taking away their livelihood\".\nMotor vehicles are banned in the Eco-sensitive zone area of Matheran, India, a tourist hill station near Mumbai so man-pulled rickshaws are still one of the major forms of transport there.\nLegislation.\nIn Tamil Nadu, in 1974, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Government of M . Karunanidhi officially banned the operation of Hand Pulled Rickshaws in Tamil Nadu by replacing them with pedal Rickshaws .\nIn August 2005, the Communist government of West Bengal announced plans to completely ban pulled rickshaws, resulting in protests and strikes of the pullers. In 2006, the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, announced that pulled rickshaws would be banned and that rickshaw pullers would be rehabilitated.\nin August 2025, Supreme Court of India officially banned pulled rickshaws.\nIndonesia.\nPulled rickshaws used to be in Indonesia a long time ago. Nowadays, they are replaced by \"Delman\" (the horse-drawn carriage) and \"Becak\" (cycle rickshaw/pedicab).\nJapan.\nThere are several theories about the invention of the rickshaw. Japan historian Seidensticker wrote of the theories:\nThough the origins of the rickshaw are not entirely clear, they seem to be Japanese, and of Tokyo specifically. The most widely accepted theory offers the name of three inventors, and gives 1869 as the date of invention.\nStarting in 1870, the Tokyo government issued a permission for Izumi Yosuke, Takayama Kosuke, and Suzuki Tokujiro to build and sell rickshaws. By 1872, they became the main mode of transportation in Japan, with about 40,000 rickshaws in service.\nThe rickshaw's popularity in Japan declined by the 1930s with the advent of automated forms of transportation, like automobiles and trains. After World War II, when gasoline and automobiles were scarce, they made a temporary come-back. The rickshaw tradition has stayed alive in Kyoto and Tokyo's geisha districts only for tourists as well as in other tourist places. The tradition completely disappeared once, but a few people revived jinrikisha (human-powered rickshaws) for tourists in the 1970s-1980s and the rickshaws became popular as a tourism resource in the 2000s. The modern rickshaw men are a kind of tourist guide, who take their clients to some tourist spots and explain about them. Many of them are part-time working students and athletes who like running or exchanging cultures.\nMalaysia.\nRickshaws were a common mode of transport in urban areas of Malaysia in the 19th and early 20th centuries until gradually replaced by cycle rickshaws.\nPakistan.\nPulled and cycle rickshaw (\"qinqi\") have been banned in Pakistan since April 1960. Prior to the introduction of auto rickshaws in cities, horse-drawn carriages (\"tongas\") were a main source of public transportation.\nPhilippines.\nThe pulled rickshaw never gained acceptance in the Philippines. Americans tried to introduce it to Manila in the early 20th century, but it was strongly opposed by local Filipinos who viewed it as an undignified mode of transport that turned humans into \"beasts\". The main mode of public and private transportation in the Philippines from the 18th to the early 20th centuries was the \"kalesa\", a two-wheeled horse-drawn carriage.\nSingapore.\nSingapore had received its first rickshaws in 1880 and soon after they were prolific, making a \"noticeable change in the traffic on Singapore's streets.\" Bullock carts and gharries were used prior to the introduction of rickshaws.\nMany of the poorest individuals in Singapore in the late nineteenth century were poor, unskilled people of Chinese ancestry. Sometimes called coolies, the hardworking men found pulling rickshaws was a new means of employment. Rickshaw pullers experienced \"very poor\" living conditions, poverty and long hours of hard work. Income remained unchanged from 1876 to 1926, about $.60 per day.\nRickshaws popularity increased into the 20th century. There were approximately 50,000 rickshaws in 1920 and that number doubled by 1930. In or after the 1920s a union was formed, called the Rickshaw Association, to protect the welfare of rickshaw workers.\nNorth America.\nUnited States.\nFrom \"A History of the Los Angeles City Market (1930-1950)\", pulled rickshaws were operated in Los Angeles by high school teenagers during that time period.\nCanada.\nFoot-driven rickshaws have enjoyed several decades of popularity in Halifax, Nova Scotia; in addition to providing tours of the historic Waterfront, rickshaws are also occasionally used for transportation by local residents. The city is home to the oldest rickshaw company in Canada.\nRickshaws are a popular mode of transportation in downtown Ottawa, Ontario, providing tours of historical Byward Market, in the summer. Ottawa's rickshaws stay true to the traditional foot-driven rickshaw model, but feature modern sound-systems.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His father, John Edmund Bentley, was a civil servant but was also a rugby union international, having played in the first-ever international match for England against Scotland in 1871. Bentley worked as a journalist on several newspapers, including \"The Daily Telegraph\". He also worked for the weekly \"The Outlook\" during the editorship of James Louis Garvin. His first published collection of poetry, titled \"Biography for Beginners\" (1905), popularised the clerihew form; it was followed by two other collections, \"More Biography\" (1929) and \"Baseless Biography\" (1939).\nHis detective novel \"Trent's Last Case\" (1913) was much praised, numbering Dorothy L. Sayers among its admirers, and with its labyrinthine and mystifying plotting can be seen as the first truly modern mystery. It was adapted as a film in 1920, 1929, and 1952. The success of the work inspired him, after 23 years, to write a sequel, \"Trent's Own Case\" (1936). There was also a book of Trent short stories, \"Trent Intervenes\" (1938).\nFrom 1936 until 1949 Bentley was president of the Detection Club. He contributed to two crime stories for the club's radio serials broadcast in 1930 and 1931, which were published in 1983 as \"The Scoop and Behind The Screen\".

{"id": "50687", "revid": "28040267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50687", "title": "Inkjet printing", "text": "Type of computer printing\nInkjet printing is a type of computer printing that recreates a digital image by propelling droplets of ink onto paper and plastic substrates. Inkjet printers were the most commonly used type of printer in 2008, and range from small inexpensive consumer models to expensive professional machines. By 2019, laser printers outsold inkjet printers by nearly a 2:1 ratio, 9.6% vs 5.1% of all computer peripherals.\nThe concept of inkjet printing originated in the 20th century, and the technology was first extensively developed in the early 1950s. While working at Canon in Japan, Ichiro Endo suggested the idea for a \"bubble jet\" printer, while around the same time Jon Vaught at Hewlett-Packard (HP) was developing a similar idea. In the late 1970s, inkjet printers that could reproduce digital images generated by computers were developed, mainly by Epson, HP and Canon. In the worldwide consumer market, four manufacturers account for the majority of inkjet printer sales: Canon, HP, Epson and Brother.\nIn 1982, Robert Howard came up with the idea to produce a small color printing system that used piezos to spit drops of ink. He formed the company, R.H. (Robert Howard) Research (named Howtek, Inc. in Feb 1984), and developed the revolutionary technology that led to the Pixelmaster color printer with solid ink using Thermojet technology. This technology consists of a tubular single nozzle acoustical wave drop generator invented originally by Steven Zoltan in 1972 with a glass nozzle and improved by the Howtek inkjet engineer in 1984 with a Tefzel molded nozzle to remove unwanted fluid frequencies.\nThe emerging ink jet material deposition market also uses inkjet technologies, typically printheads using piezoelectric crystals, to deposit materials directly on substrates.\nThe technology has been extended and the 'ink' can now also comprise solder paste in PCB assembly, or living cells, for creating biosensors and for tissue engineering.\nImages produced on inkjet printers are sometimes sold under trade names such as Digigraph, Iris prints, gicl\u00e9e, and Cromalin. Inkjet-printed fine art reproductions are commonly sold under such trade names to imply a higher-quality product and avoid association with everyday printing.\nMethods.\nFluid surface tension naturally pulls a stream into droplets. Optimal drop sizes of require an inkjet nozzle size of about . Fluids with surface tension may be water based, wax or oil based and even melted metal alloys. Most drops can be electrically charged. There are two main technologies in use in contemporary inkjet printers: continuous (CIJ) and drop-on-demand (DOD). Continuous inkjet means the flow is pressurized and in a continuous stream. Drop-on-demand means the fluid is expelled from the jet nozzle one drop at a time. This can be done with a mechanical means with a push or some electrical method. A large electrical charge can pull drops out of a nozzle, sound waves can push fluid from a nozzle or a chamber volume expansion can expel a drop. Continuous streaming was investigated first many years ago. Drop-on-demand was only discovered in the 1920s.\nContinuous inkjet.\nThe continuous inkjet (CIJ) method is used commercially for marking and coding of products and packages with best-by dates, lot and batch codes, and other product information. In 1867, Lord Kelvin patented the syphon recorder, which recorded telegraph signals as a continuous trace on paper using an ink jet nozzle deflected by a magnetic coil. The first commercial devices (medical strip chart recorders) were introduced in 1951 by Siemens. using the patent US2566443 invented by Rune Elmqvist dated September 4, 1951.\nIn CIJ technology, a high-pressure pump directs liquid ink from a reservoir through a gunbody and a microscopic nozzle (usually .003 inch diameter), creating a continuous stream of ink droplets via the Plateau-Rayleigh instability. A piezoelectric crystal may be used to create an acoustic wave as it vibrates within the gunbody and causes the stream of liquid to break into droplets at regular intervals: 64,000 to 165,000 irregular-sized ink droplets per second may be achieved. The ink droplets are subjected to an electrostatic field created by a charging electrode or by a magnetic flux field as they form; the field varies according to the degree of drop deflection desired. This results in a controlled deflection by electrostatic charge on each droplet. Charged droplets may be separated by one or more uncharged \"guard droplets\" to minimize electrostatic repulsion between neighboring droplets.\nThe droplets pass through another electrostatic or magnetic field and are directed (deflected) by electrostatic deflection plates or flux field to print on the receptor material (substrate), or allowed to continue on deflected to a collection gutter for re-use. The more highly charged droplets are deflected to a greater degree. Only a small fraction of the droplets is used to print, the majority being recycled.\nCIJ is one of the oldest (1951) ink jet technologies in use and is fairly mature. Drop-on-demand was not invented until later. The major advantages of CIJ are the very high velocity (\u224820\u00a0m/s) of the ink droplets, which allows for a relatively long distance between print head and substrate, and the very high drop ejection frequency, allowing for very high speed printing. Another advantage is freedom from nozzle clogging as the jet is always in use, therefore allowing volatile solvents such as ketones and alcohols to be employed, giving the ink the ability to \"bite\" into the substrate and dry quickly. The ink system requires active solvent regulation to counter solvent evaporation during the time of flight (time between nozzle ejection and gutter recycling), and from the venting process whereby air that is drawn into the gutter along with the unused drops is vented from the reservoir. Viscosity is monitored and a solvent (or solvent blend) is added to counteract solvent loss.\nIn the later 1950s, heated wax inks became popular with CIJ technologies. In 1971, Johannes F. Gottwald patent US3596285A, Liquid Metal Recorder used molten metal ink with a magnetic flux field to fabricate formed symbols for signage. This may have been the first 3D metal object printed using magnetic core memory as data to produce each symbol.\nDrop-on-demand.\nThere are many ways to produce a drop-on-demand (DOD) inkjet. Common methods include thermal DOD and piezoelectric DOD to speed up the frequency of drops. DOD may use a single nozzle or thousands of nozzles. One DOD process uses software that directs the heads to apply between zero and eight droplets of ink per dot, only where needed. Inkjet fluid materials have expanded to include pastes, epoxies, hot-melt inks, biological fluids, etc. DOD is very popular and has an interesting history. Mechanical DOD came first, followed by electrical methods including piezoelectric devices and then thermal or heat expansion methods.\nInk formulations.\nThe earliest reference to a continuous inkjet ink (CIJ) in the 1971 patent US3596285A states \" The preferred ink is characterized by viscosity and surface tension characteristics such that the liquid will be maintained over span under the force with which it is moving in bridge or stream. Implicit in such requirement is that the pressure applied to the ink in formation of said stream is sufficient to form a jet and to impart enough energy to carry the jet as a continuous liquid mass notwithstanding the defective forces which are or may be applied. Furthermore, the color of the ink and the color of the carrier should be such that good optical contrast is formed there between the following printing. The preferred ink is a \"hot-melt ink\". That is to say it will assume a solid phase at the temperature of the carrier and liquid phase at some higher temperature. The range of commercially available ink compositions which could meet the requirement of the invention are not known at the present time. However, satisfactory printing according to the invention has been achieved with a conductive metal alloy as ink. It is extremely hard at room temperature and adheres well to the surface of the carrier.\nThe basic problem with inkjet inks is the conflicting requirements for a coloring agent that will stay on the surface versus rapid bleed through the carrier fluid.\nDesktop inkjet printers, as used in offices and homes, tend to use aqueous ink based on a mixture of water, glycol and dyes or pigments. These inks are inexpensive to manufacture but difficult to control on the surface of media, often requiring specially coated media. HP inks contain sulfonated polyazo black dye (commonly used for dyeing leather), nitrates and other compounds. Aqueous inks are mainly used in printers with thermal inkjet heads, as these heads require water to perform the ink-expelling function.\nWhile aqueous inks often provide the broadest color gamut and most vivid color, most are not waterproof without specialized coating or lamination after printing. Most dye-based inks, while usually the least expensive, are subject to rapid fading when exposed to light or ozone. Pigment-based aqueous inks are typically more costly but provide much better long-term durability and ultraviolet resistance. Inks marketed as \"archival quality\" are usually pigment-based.\nSome professional wide format printers use aqueous inks, but the majority in professional use today employ a much wider range of inks, most of which require piezo inkjet heads and extensive maintenance.\nPrinting heads.\nThere are two main design philosophies in inkjet head design: \"fixed-head\" and \"disposable head\". Each has its own strengths and weaknesses.\nFixed head.\nThe \"fixed-head\" philosophy provides an inbuilt print head (often referred to as a \"gaiter-head\") that is designed to last for the life of the printer. The idea is that because the head need not be replaced every time the ink runs out, consumable costs can be made lower and the head itself can be more precise than a cheap disposable one, typically requiring no calibration. On the other hand, if a fixed head is damaged, obtaining a replacement head can become expensive, if removing and replacing the head is even possible. If the printer's head cannot be removed, the printer itself will then need to be replaced.\nFixed head designs are available in consumer products, but are more likely to be found on industrial high-end printers and large format printers. In the consumer space, fixed-head printers are manufactured primarily by Epson and Canon; however, many more recent Hewlett-Packard models use a fixed head, such as the Officejet Pro 8620 and HP's Pagewide series.\nDisposable head.\nThe \"disposable head\" philosophy uses a print head which is supplied as a part of a replaceable ink cartridge. Every time a cartridge is exhausted, the entire cartridge and print head are replaced with a new one. This adds to the cost of consumables and makes it more difficult to manufacture a high-precision head at a reasonable cost, but also means that a damaged or clogged print head is only a minor problem: the user can simply buy a new cartridge. Hewlett-Packard has traditionally favored the disposable print head, as did Canon in its early models. This type of construction can also be seen as an effort by printer manufacturers to stem third party ink cartridge assembly replacements, as these would-be suppliers do not have the ability to manufacture specialized print heads.\nAn intermediate method does exist: a disposable ink tank connected to a disposable head, which is replaced infrequently (perhaps every tenth ink tank or so). Most high-volume Hewlett-Packard inkjet printers use this setup, with the disposable print heads used on lower volume models. A similar approach is used by Kodak, where the printhead intended for permanent use is nevertheless inexpensive and can be replaced by the user. Canon now uses (in most models) replaceable print heads which are designed to last the life of the printer, but can be replaced by the user should they become clogged.\nCleaning mechanisms.\nThe primary cause of inkjet printing problems is ink drying on the printhead's nozzles, causing the pigments and dyes to dry out and form a solid block of hardened mass that plugs the microscopic ink passageways. Most printers attempt to prevent this drying from occurring by covering the printhead nozzles with a rubber cap when the printer is not in use. Abrupt power losses, or unplugging the printer before it has capped the printhead, can cause the printhead to be left in an uncapped state. Even when the head is capped, this seal is not perfect, and over a period of several weeks the moisture (or other solvent) can still seep out, causing the ink to dry and harden. Once ink begins to collect and harden, the drop volume can be affected, drop trajectory can change, or the nozzle can completely fail to jet ink.\nTo combat this drying, nearly all inkjet printers include a mechanism to reapply moisture to the printhead. Typically there is no separate supply of pure ink-free solvent available to do this job, and so instead the ink itself is used to remoisten the printhead. The printer attempts to fire all nozzles at once, and as the ink sprays out, some of it wicks across the printhead to the dry channels and partially softens the hardened ink. After spraying, a rubber wiper blade is swept across the printhead to spread the moisture evenly across the printhead, and all jets are again fired to dislodge any ink clumps blocking the channels.\nSome printers use a supplemental air-suction pump, using the rubber capping station to suck ink through a severely clogged cartridge. The suction pump mechanism is frequently driven by the page feed stepper motor: it is connected to the end of the shaft. The pump only engages when the shaft turns backwards, hence the rollers reversing while head cleaning. Due to the built-in head design, the suction pump is also needed to prime the ink channels inside a new printer, and to reprime the channels between ink tank changes.\nProfessional solvent- and UV-curable ink wide-format inkjet printers generally include a \"manual clean\" mode that allows the operator to manually clean the print heads and capping mechanism and to replace the wiper blades and other parts used in the automated cleaning processes. The volume of ink used in these printers often leads to \"overspray\" and therefore buildup of dried ink in many places that automated processes are not capable of cleaning.\nThe ink consumed in the cleaning process needs to be collected to prevent ink from leaking in the printer. The collection area is called the spittoon, and in Hewlett-Packard printers this is an open plastic tray underneath the cleaning/wiping station. In Epson printers, there is typically a large absorption pad in a pan underneath the paper feed platen. For printers that are several years old, it is common for the dried ink in the spittoon to form a pile that can stack up and touch the printheads, jamming the printer. Some larger professional printers using solvent inks may employ a replaceable plastic receptacle to contain waste ink and solvent, which must be emptied or replaced when full.\nThere is a second type of ink drying that most printers are unable to prevent. For ink to spray from the cartridge, air must enter to displace the removed ink. The air enters via an extremely long, thin labyrinth tube, up to long, wrapping back and forth across the ink tank. The channel is long and narrow to reduce moisture evaporation through the vent tube, but some evaporation still occurs and eventually the ink cartridge dries up from the inside out. To combat this problem, which is especially acute with professional fast-drying solvent inks, many wide-format printer cartridge designs contain the ink in an airtight, collapsible bag that requires no vent. The bag merely shrinks until the cartridge is empty.\nThe frequent cleaning conducted by some printers can consume quite a bit of ink and has a great impact on cost-per-page determinations.\nClogged nozzles can be detected by printing a standard test pattern on the page. Some software workaround methods are known for rerouting printing information from a clogged nozzle to a working nozzle.\nInk delivery developments.\nInk cartridges have been the traditional method for delivering ink to the printhead. Continuous ink system (CISS) inkjet printers connect the printhead either to high-capacity ink tanks or packs, or replenish the built-in cartridges via external tanks connected via tubes, typically a retrofit configuration. Supertank printers\u2013a subset of CISS printers\u2013have high-capacity integrated ink tanks or ink packs, and are manually refilled via ink bottles. When supertank ink systems are paired with disposable printhead technology, replaceable cartridges are used to replace the exhausted print heads.\nAdvantages.\nCompared to earlier consumer-oriented color printers, inkjet printers have a number of advantages. They are quieter in operation than impact dot matrix or daisywheel printers. They can print finer, smoother details through higher resolution. Consumer inkjet printers with photographic print quality are widely available.\nIn comparison to technologies like thermal wax, dye sublimation, and laser printing, inkjets have the advantage of practically no warm up time, and often lower cost per page. However, low-cost laser printers can have lower per-page costs, at least for black-and-white printing, and possibly for color.\nFor some inkjet printers, monochrome ink sets are available either from the printer manufacturer or from third-party suppliers. These allow the inkjet printer to compete with the silver-based photographic papers traditionally used in black-and-white photography, and provide the same range of tones: neutral, \"warm\" or \"cold\". When switching between full-color and monochrome ink sets, it is necessary to flush out the old ink from the print head with a cleaning cartridge. Special software or at least a modified device driver are usually required, to deal with the different color mapping.\nSome types of industrial inkjet printers are now capable of printing at very high speeds, in wide formats, or for a variety of industrial applications ranging from signage, textiles, optical media, ceramics and 3-D printing into biomedical applications and conductive circuitry. Leading companies and innovators in hardware include HP, Epson, Canon, Konica Minolta, Fujifilm, EFi, Durst, Brother, Roland DG, Mimaki, Mutoh and many others worldwide.\nDisadvantages.\nMany \"intelligent\" ink cartridges contain a microchip that communicates the estimated ink level to the printer; this may cause the printer to display an error message, or incorrectly inform the user that the ink cartridge is empty. In some cases, these messages can be ignored, but some inkjet printers will refuse to print with a cartridge that declares itself empty, to prevent consumers from refilling cartridges. For example, Epson embeds a chip which prevents printing when the chip claims the cartridge is empty, although a researcher who over-rode the system found that in one case he could print up to 38% more good quality pages, even though the chip stated that the cartridge was empty. Third-party ink suppliers sell ink cartridges at significant discounts (at least 10\u201330% off OEM cartridge prices, sometimes up to 95%, typically averaging around 50%), and also bulk ink and cartridge self-refill kits at even lower prices. Many vendors' \"intelligent\" ink cartridges have been reverse-engineered. It is now possible to buy inexpensive devices to reliably reset such cartridges to report themselves as full, so that they may be refilled many times.\nThe very narrow inkjet nozzles are prone to clogging. The ink consumed in cleaning them\u2014either during cleaning invoked by the user, or in many cases, performed automatically by the printer on a routine schedule\u2014can account for a significant proportion of the ink used in the machine. Inkjet printing head nozzles can be cleaned using specialized solvents, or by soaking in warm distilled water for short periods of time (for water-soluble inks.)\nThe high cost of OEM ink cartridges and the intentional obstacles to refilling them have been addressed by the growth of third-party ink suppliers. Many printer manufacturers discourage customers from using third-party inks, stating that they can damage the print heads due to not being the same formulation as the OEM inks, cause leaks, and produce inferior-quality output (e.g., of incorrect color gamut). \"Consumer Reports\" has noted that some third-party cartridges may contain less ink than OEM cartridges, and thus yield no cost savings, while Wilhelm Imaging Research claims that with third-party inks the lifetime of prints may be considerably reduced. However, an April 2007 review showed that, in a double-blind test, reviewers generally \"preferred\" the output produced using third-party ink over OEM ink. In general, OEM inks have undergone significant system reliability testing with the cartridge and print-head materials, whereas R&amp;D efforts on third-party ink material compatibility are likely to be significantly less. Some inkjet manufacturers have tried to prevent cartridges being refilled using various schemes including fitting chips to the cartridges that log how much the cartridge has printed and prevent the operation of a refilled cartridge.\nThe warranty on a printer may not apply if the printer is damaged by the use of non-approved supplies. In the US the Magnuson\u2013Moss Warranty Act is a federal law which states that warrantors cannot require that only brand name parts and supplies be used with their products, as some printer manufacturers imply. However, this would not apply if non-approved items cause damage.\nDurability.\nInkjet documents can have poor to excellent archival durability, depending on the quality of the inks and paper used. If low-quality paper is used, it can yellow and degrade due to residual acid in the untreated pulp; in the worst case, old prints can literally crumble into small particles when handled. High-quality inkjet prints on acid-free paper can last as long as typewritten or handwritten documents on the same paper.\nBecause the ink used in many low-cost consumer inkjets is water-soluble, care must be taken with inkjet-printed documents to avoid even the smallest drop of moisture, which can cause severe \"blurring\" or \"running\". In extreme cases, even sweaty fingertips during hot humid weather could cause low-quality inks to smear. Similarly, water-based highlighter markers can blur inkjet-printed documents and discolor the highlighter's tip. The lifetime of inkjet prints produced using aqueous inks is generally shorter (although UV-resistant inks are available) than those produced with solvent-based inkjets; however, so-called \"archival inks\" have been produced for use in aqueous-based machines which offer extended life.\nIn addition to smearing, gradual fading of many inks can be a problem over time. Print lifetime is highly dependent on the quality and formulation of the ink. The earliest inkjet printers, intended for home and small office applications, used dye-based inks. Even the best dye-based inks are not as durable as pigment-based inks, which are now available for many inkjet printers. Many inkjet printers now utilize pigment based inks which are highly water resistant: at least the black ink is often pigment-based. Resin or silicone protected photopaper is widely available at low cost, introducing complete water and mechanical rub resistance for dye and pigment inks. The photopaper itself must be designed for pigment or for dye inks, as pigment particles are too large to be able to penetrate through dye-only photopaper protection layer.\nThe highest-quality inkjet prints are often called \"gicl\u00e9e\" prints, to distinguish them from less-durable and lower-cost prints. However, the use of the term is no guarantee of quality, and the inks and paper used must be carefully investigated before an archivist can rely on their long-term durability.\nTo increase the durability of inkjet printer prints, more attention is needed for the inkjet ink cartridge. One way to treat ink cartridges on an inkjet printer is to maintain the temperature of the printer itself. Excessive variation in space temperature is very bad for printer ink cartridges. The user should prevent the printer becoming too hot or too chilly as the cartridges can dry up. For lasting printer efficiency, the user should ensure the area has a regular and steady temperature level.\nOperating cost tradeoffs.\nInkjets use solvent-based inks which have much shorter expiration dates compared to laser toner, which has an indefinite shelf life. Inkjet printers tend to clog if not used regularly, whereas laser printers are much more tolerant of intermittent use. Inkjet printers require periodical head cleaning, which consumes a considerable amount of ink, and will drive printing costs higher especially if the printer is unused for long periods.\nIf an inkjet head becomes clogged, third-party ink solvents/head cleaners and replacement heads are available in some cases. The cost of such items may be less expensive compared to a transfer unit for a laser printer, but the laser printer unit has a much longer lifetime between required maintenance. Many inkjet printer models now have permanently installed heads, which cannot be economically replaced if they become irreversibly clogged, resulting in scrapping of the entire printer. On the other hand, inkjet printer designs which use a disposable printhead usually cost significantly more per page than printers using permanent heads. By contrast, laser printers do not have printheads to clog or replace frequently, and usually can produce many more pages between maintenance intervals.\nInkjet printers have traditionally produced better quality output than color laser printers when printing photographic material. Both technologies have improved dramatically over time, although the highest-quality gicl\u00e9e prints favored by artists use what is essentially a high-quality specialized type of inkjet printer.\nBusiness model.\nA common business model for inkjet printers involves selling the actual printer at or below production cost, while dramatically marking up the price of the (proprietary) ink cartridges (a profit model called the \"razor and blades model\"). Most current inkjet printers attempt to enforce this product tying by anticompetitive measures such as microchips in the cartridges to hinder the use of third-party or refilled ink cartridges. The microchips monitor usage and report the ink remaining to the printer. Some manufacturers also impose \"expiration dates\". When the chip reports that the cartridge is empty (or out of date) the printer stops printing. Even if the cartridge is refilled, the microchip will indicate to the printer that the cartridge is depleted. For many models (especially from Canon), the 'empty' status can be overridden by entering a 'service code' (or sometimes simply by pressing the 'start' button again). For some printers, special circuit \"flashers\" are available that reset the quantity of remaining ink to the maximum.\nSome manufacturers, most notably Epson and Hewlett-Packard, have been accused of indicating that a cartridge is depleted while a substantial amount of ink remains. A 2007 study found that most printers waste a significant quantity of ink when they declare a cartridge to be empty. Single-ink cartridges were found to have on average 20% of their ink remaining, though actual figures range from 9% to 64% of the cartridge's total ink capacity, depending on the brand and model of printer. This problem is further compounded with the use of one-piece multi-ink cartridges, which are declared empty as soon as one color runs low. Of great annoyance to many users are those printers that will refuse to print documents requiring only black ink, just because one or more of the color ink cartridges is depleted.\nIn recent years, many consumers have begun to challenge the business practices of printer manufacturers, such as charging up to US$8,000 per gallon (US$2,100 per liter) for printer ink. Alternatives for consumers are cheaper copies of cartridges, produced by third parties, and the refilling of cartridges, using refill kits. Due to the large differences in price caused by OEM markups, there are many companies selling third-party ink cartridges. Most printer manufacturers discourage refilling disposable cartridges or using aftermarket copy cartridges, and say that use of incorrect inks may cause poor image quality due to differences in viscosity, which can affect the amount of ink ejected in a drop, and color consistency, and can damage the printhead. Nonetheless, the use of alternative cartridges and inks has been gaining in popularity, threatening the business model of printer manufacturers. Printer companies such as HP, Lexmark, and Epson have used patents and the DMCA to launch lawsuits against third-party vendors. An anti-trust class-action lawsuit was launched in the US against HP and office supply chain Staples, alleging that HP paid Staples $100 million to keep inexpensive third-party ink cartridges off the shelves.\nIn Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that circumvention of this technique does not violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The European Commission also ruled this practice anticompetitive: it will disappear in newer models sold in the European Union. Patents protecting the structure of their cartridges prevent the sale of cheaper copies of the cartridges. For some printer models (notably those from Canon), the manufacturer's own microchip can be removed and fitted to a compatible cartridge thereby avoiding the need to replicate the microchip (and risk prosecution). Other manufacturers embed their microchips deep within the cartridge in an effort to prevent this approach.\nIn 2007, Eastman Kodak entered the inkjet market with its own line of All-In-One printers based on a marketing model that differed from the prevailing practice of selling the printer at a loss while making large profits on replacement ink cartridges. Kodak claimed that consumers could save up to 50 percent on printing by using its lower-cost cartridges filled with the company's proprietary pigmented colorants while avoiding the potential problems associated with off-brand inks. This strategy proved unsuccessful, and Kodak exited the consumer inkjet printer business in 2012.\nA more recent development is the supertank printer, which uses an integrated continuous ink system. Supertank printers are defined by their large, permanently installed ink tanks which are filled from ink bottles. The printer itself is typically sold at a substantial premium, but ink bottles are inexpensive and contain enough ink to print thousands of pages. Supertank printers generally ship with full bottles of ink in the box, allowing up to two years of printing before the tanks needs to be refilled. Epson pioneered this technology by launching the EcoTank range, first in Indonesia in 2010, with a North American launch in 2015. The supertank concept proved commercially successful, and Canon and HP launched their own lines of supertank printers, under the names MegaTank (Canon) and Smart Tank (HP).\nRegion-coding of printers and ink cartridges.\nMany manufacturers give their printers and cartridges region codes, comparable to those of DVDs, so customers cannot import them from a cheaper region. The region code can be changed a few times by the customer or the customer-service department of the manufacturer, but then, the printer is region-locked like a RPC-2 DVD drive.\nOne method to bypass printer-region-coding is to store empty cartridges from the old region and refill them with ink from the new region, but, as mentioned above, many modern ink cartridges have chips and sensors to prevent refilling, which makes the process more difficult. On the Internet, there are refill instructions for different printer models available. Another method is to have ink cartridges from the old region shipped to the new region.\nSome manufacturers of region-coded printers also offer region-free printers specially designed for travelers.\nPrinter types.\nProfessional models.\nIn addition to the widely used small inkjet printers for home and office, there are professional inkjet printers, some for \"page-width\" format printing and many for wide format printing. \"Page-width format\" means that the print width ranges from about . \"Wide format\" means print width ranging from 24\" up to 15' (about 60\u00a0cm to 5m). The most common application of page-width printers is in printing high-volume business communications that do not need high-quality layout and color. Particularly with the addition of variable data technologies, the page-width printers are important in billing, tagging, and individualized catalogs and newspapers. The application of most wide format printers is in printing advertising graphics; a lower-volume application is printing of design documents by architects or engineers. But nowadays, there are inkjet printers for digital textile printing up to 64\" wide with good high definition image of 1440\u00d7720 dpi.\nAnother specialty application for inkjets is producing prepress color proofs for printing jobs created digitally. Such printers are designed to give accurate color rendition of how the final image will look (a \"proof\") when the job is finally produced on a large volume press such as a four-color offset lithography press. An example is an Iris printer, whose output is what the French term \"gicl\u00e9e\" was coined for.\nThe largest-volume supplier is Hewlett-Packard, which supplies over 90 percent of the market for printers for printing technical drawings. The major products in their Designjet series are the Designjet 500/800, the Designjet T Printer series (including the T1100 and T610), the Designjet 1050 and the Designjet 4000/4500. They also have the HP Designjet 5500, a six-color printer that is used especially for printing graphics as well as the new Designjet Z6100 which sits at the top of the HP Designjet range and features an eight color pigment ink system.\nEpson, Kodak, and Canon also manufacture wide-format printers, sold in much smaller numbers than standard printers. Epson has a group of three Japanese companies around it that predominantly use Epson piezo printheads and inks: Mimaki, Roland, and Mutoh.\nScitex Digital Printing developed high-speed, variable-data, inkjet printers for production printing, but sold its profitable assets associated with the technology to Kodak in 2005 who now market the printers as Kodak Versamark VJ1000, VT3000, and VX5000 printing systems. These roll-fed printers can print at up to 305m per minute.\nProfessional high-volume inkjet printers are made by a range of companies. These printers can range in price from US$35,000 to $2 million. Carriage widths on these units can range from 54\" to 192\" (about 1.4 to 5\u00a0m), and ink technologies have tended toward solvent, eco-solvent, and UV-curing with a more recent focus toward water-based (aqueous) ink sets. Major applications where these printers are used are for outdoor settings for billboards, truck sides and truck curtains, building graphics and banners, while indoor displays include point-of-sales displays, backlit displays, exhibition graphics, and museum graphics.\nThe major suppliers for professional high-volume, wide- and grand-format printers include: EFI, LexJet, Grapo, Inca, Durst, Oc\u00e9, NUR (now part of Hewlett-Packard), L\u00fcscher, VUTEk, Scitex Vision (now part of Hewlett-Packard), Mutoh, Mimaki, Roland DG, Seiko I Infotech, IQDEMY, Leggett and Platt, Agfa, Raster Printers, DGI and MacDermid ColorSpan (now part of Hewlett-Packard), swissqprint, SPGPrints (formerly Stork Prints), MS Printing Systems and Digital Media Warehouse.\nSOHO multifunction inkjet photo printers.\nSOHO multifunction inkjet printers for photo printing use up to 6 different inks:\nProfessional inkjet photo printers.\nInkjet printers for professional photo printing use up to twelve different inks:\nThey can print an image of 36 megapixels on A3 borderless photo paper with 444 ppi.\nCompact photo printers.\nA compact photo printer is a stand-alone inkjet printer designed to produce 4\u00d76 or 2\u00d73\u00a0inch prints from digital cameras. It works without the use of a computer. It is also known as a portable photo printer or a snapshot printer. Compact photo printers came on the market shortly after the popularity of home photo printing took off in the early 2000s. They were designed as an alternative to developing photos or printing them on a standard inkjet photo printer.\nThe majority of compact photo printers can only print pictures. Given this limitation, they are not meant to replace standard inkjets. Many manufacturers advertise the cost per page of photos printed on their machines; this theoretically convinces people that they can print their own pictures just as cheaply as retail stores or through online printing services. Most compact photo printers share a similar design. They are small units, usually with large LCDs in order to allow people to browse and edit their photos, as can be done on a computer. The editing options are usually somewhat advanced, allowing the user to crop photos, remove red eye, adjust color settings as well as other functions. Compact photo printers typically feature a large number of connection options, including USB and most memory card formats.\nCompact photo printers are currently manufactured by most of the leading printer manufacturers such as Epson, Canon, HP, Lexmark and Kodak. While they have increased in popularity in recent years, they still make up a relatively small share of the inkjet printer market. LG's Pocket Photo uses Zink thermal paper which has chemistries embedded on each inkless photo paper and the image will appear with the heat.\nOther uses.\nU.S. Patent 6,319,530 describes a \"Method of photocopying an image onto an edible web for decorating iced baked goods\". In other words, this invention enables one to inkjet print a food-grade color photograph on a birthday cake's surface. Many bakeries now carry these types of decorations, which are printable using edible inks and dedicated inkjet printers. Edible ink printing can be done using normal home use inkjet printers like Canon Bubble Jet printers with edible ink cartridges installed, and using rice paper or frosting sheets.\nInkjet printers and similar technologies are used in the production of many microscopic items. See Microelectromechanical systems.\nInkjet printers are used to form conductive traces for circuits, and color filters in LCD and plasma displays.\nInkjet printers, especially models produced by Dimatix (now part of Fujifilm), Xennia Technology and Pixdro, are in fairly common use in many labs around the world for developing alternative deposition methods that reduce consumption of expensive, rare, or problematic materials. These printers have been used in the printing of polymer, macromolecular, quantum dot, metallic nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes. The applications of such printing methods include organic thin-film transistors, organic light emitting diodes, organic solar cells, and sensors.\nInkjet technology is used in the emerging field of bioprinting. They are also used for the production of OLED displays."}

It is notable for having the largest (by far) cones in the genus \"Pseudotsuga\", hence the name.\nThe tree occurs from the San Rafael Mountains in central Santa Barbara County and the Tehachapi Mountains of southwestern Kern County, south through the Transverse Ranges, to the Cuyamaca Mountains in San Diego County. The tree is shade-tolerant and prefers to grow on slopes.\nName.\n\"Pseudotsuga macrocarpa\" is a Douglas-fir. The name \"bigcone spruce\", though confusing as it is not a spruce species, is often still used, and occurs in place names.\nDescription.\n\"Pseudotsuga macrocarpa\" typically grows from in height and in trunk diameter. The growth form is straight, with a conical crown from broad, and a strong and spreading root system. The bark is deeply ridged, composed of thin, woodlike plates separating heavy layers of cork; bark of trees over in diameter is from thick. The main branches are long and spreading with pendulous side shoots.\nThe leaves are needle-like, long, and are shed when about five years old. The female cones are from long, larger and with thicker scales than those of other douglas-firs, and with exserted tridentine bracts. The seeds are large and heavy, 10\u00a0mm long and 8\u00a0mm broad, with a short rounded wing 13\u00a0mm long; they may be bird or mammal dispersed as the wing is too small to be effective for wind dispersal. Trees start producing seeds at about 20 years of age.\nThe largest known individual of this species is tall, in diameter, and is estimated to be from 600 to 700 years of age.\nDistribution.\n\"Pseudotsuga macrocarpa\" is restricted to the California montane chaparral and woodlands and California coastal sage and chaparral ecoregions of California. It prefers a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot dry summers and wet, mild winters. Annual rainfall during a 30-year period on a bigcone Douglas-fir site in the San Gabriel Mountains averaged and ranged from .\nBigcone Douglas-fir occurs between . At low elevation, it occurs near streams in moist, shaded canyons and draws where aspects are mostly north and east. At elevations from , aspects include south- and east-facing slopes. At these elevations, it also grows on sloping hillsides, ridges, and benches. At higher elevations, it occurs on south and west aspects on all types of terrain. The average angle of slope on which it grows is 35 degrees, ranging from level to 90 degrees, although these extremes are uncommon.\nRanges the tree is found in, south to north, include:\nEcology.\n\"Pseudotsuga macrocarpa\", has several features to tolerate and survive wildfire, notably the very thick bark, and the presence of numerous adventitious buds on the upper side of the branches; this enables the trees to survive even crown fires which burn off all the branchlets, the apparently dead trees becoming green again the following spring. Wildfire frequencies in the chaparral habitats in which it often grows typically range from 15 to 50 year intervals. Bigcone Douglas-fir is closely associated with canyon live oak (\"Quercus chrysolepis\") and often establishes itself in its shade; after about 50 years, it emerges above the oak canopy.\nThe number of plant associates in bigcone Douglas-fir communities is usually small. \nFire ecology.\n\"Pseudotsuga macrocarpa\" populations are suspected to be declining due to possibly larger and more extreme wildland fires with greater frequencies. Major wildfires within its range, since 2003, have clearly proven a reduced extent when compared to early 1930s extents derived from historical aerial photos. Although historical information has provided the opportunity to detect stand level patch changes, post-fire resprouting of older more mature trees and natural regeneration and recruitment of the species into higher canopy has yet to be adequately quantified.\nOne tree species in direct competition with bigcone is \"Calocedrus decurrens\", with preliminary post-fire regeneration of this species exponentially greater than bigcone. One or two years after the Station fire in 2009 on the Angeles National Forest, there was an estimated 20:1 cedar:bigcone seedling density in fixed radius plots on Mount Wilson. It may be more appropriate to perform population stability estimates up to five years or much later (i.e. 20 yrs) after a large conflagration due to the potential for immediate and delayed post-fire sprouting and regeneration and interplant competition, as well as the well-noted strategy of seed germination in shrub understories, which is likely to escape detection by surveyors until much later in its life.\nResearch related to the role of mycorrhizae and its relationship to seed establishment needs evaluated in these vegetation communities due to the suspected role it has with the relationship with water, especially in water-limited systems such as those in the wildlands of southern California. In addition, an aggressive seed cone collection strategy should be drafted for this species which includes extensive collection during large cone production years such as 2013, and should include a tracking system to determine correlations to climatic conditions in order to develop a foundation from which to perform species viability assessments w/ varying future climate scenarios.\nThis tree is being considered for more extensive plantings in semiarid locales. Its favorable qualities include resistance to drought, fire, insects, decay, and damage from ozone, and its aggressive rooting system and tolerance to variable growing medium. The needles of older trees sometimes fade to yellow, drop, and trees appear dead only to sprout with renewed vigor within two years. The reason is unknown, although drought or insects may be possible causes.\nUses.\nWildlife.\nBigcone Douglas-fir stands provide habitat for black-tailed deer, black bear, and various small animals. These trees provide preferred spring habitat for black bear in the San Bernardino Mountains.\nThe seeds are eaten by various rodents and birds.\nRestoration species.\nBigcone Douglas-fir is used for watershed and habitat restoration. The Los Angeles County Department of Forestry has extensively planted the tree over a 50-year period for that purpose.\nSome hybrids of \"Pseudotsuga macrocarpa\" (Bigcone Douglas-fir) \u00d7 \"Pseudotsuga menziesii\" (Coast Douglas-fir) show promise for planting on drier restoration sites within the \"P. menziesii\"\u2212Douglas-fir natural range. These hybrids produce wood of comparable quality to that of Douglas-fir and have the drought tolerance of bigcone Douglas-fir.\nTimber.\nThere is no current commercial market for bigcone Douglas-fir wood due to limited distribution and access. It is heavy, hard, and fine grained but not durable. There is less sapwood than heartwood, and the latter contains pockets of resin.\nIn the past, the wood was used locally for fuel and lumber.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the tallest tree in the Pinaceae family. It is native to western North America and is also known as Douglas-fir, Douglas spruce, Oregon pine, and Columbian pine. There are three varieties: coast Douglas-fir (\"P. menziesii\" var. \"menziesii\"), Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (\"P. menziesii\" var. \"glauca\") and Mexican Douglas-fir (\"P. menziesii\" var. \"lindleyana\").\nDespite its common names, it is not a true fir (genus \"Abies\"), spruce (genus \"Picea\"), or pine (genus \"Pinus\"). It is also not a hemlock (genus \"Tsuga\"); the genus name \"Pseudotsuga\" means \"false hemlock\".\nDescription.\nDouglas-firs are medium-sized to extremely large evergreen trees, tall (although only coast Douglas-firs reach heights near 100\u00a0m) and commonly reach in diameter, although trees with diameters of almost exist. The largest coast Douglas-firs regularly live over 500 years, with the oldest specimens living for over 1,300 years. Rocky Mountain Douglas-firs, found further to the east, are less long-lived, usually not exceeding 400 years in age.\nThere are records of former coast Douglas-firs exceeding in height, which if alive today would make it the tallest tree species on Earth. Particular historical specimens with heights exceeding include the Lynn Valley Tree and the Nooksack Giant.\nThe leaves are flat, soft, linear needles long, generally resembling those of the firs, occurring singly rather than in fascicles; they completely encircle the branches, which can be useful in recognizing the species. As the trees grow taller in denser forest, they lose their lower branches, such that the foliage may start as high as off the ground. Douglas-firs in environments with more light may have branches much closer to the ground.\nThe bark on young trees is thin, smooth, gray, and contains numerous resin blisters. On mature trees, usually exceeding 80 years, it is very thick and corky, growing up to thick with distinctive, deep vertical fissures caused by the gradual expansion of the growing tree. Some of the mature bark is brown, while other parts are lighter colored with a cork-like texture; these develop in multiple layers. This thick bark makes the Douglas-fir one of the most fire-resistant tree native to the Pacific Northwest.\nThe male cones are yellowish red, long. The female cones are green when young, maturing to reddish-brown or gray, long; they are pendulous, with persistent scales, unlike those of true firs. They have distinctive long, trifid (three-pointed) bracts which protrude prominently above each scale and are said to resemble the back half of a mouse, with two feet and a tail. The seeds are long, with a longer wing.\nThe massive genome of Douglas-fir was sequenced in 2017 by the large PineRefSeq consortium, revealing a specialized photosynthetic apparatus in the light-harvesting complex of genes.\nTaxonomy.\nThe common name honors David Douglas, a Scottish botanist and collector who first reported the extraordinary nature and potential of the species. The common name is misleading since it is not a true fir, i.e., not a member of the genus \"Abies\". For this reason, the name is often written as Douglas-fir (a name also used for the genus \"Pseudotsuga\" as a whole). Douglas' connection to the Douglas fir is told in the 1962 \"Death Valley Days\" episode 'Grass Man'.\nThe specific epithet \"menziesii\" is after Archibald Menzies, a Scottish physician and rival naturalist to David Douglas. Menzies first documented the tree on Vancouver Island in 1791. Colloquially, the species is also known simply as Doug fir or Douglas pine (although the latter common name may also refer to \"Pinus douglasiana\"). Other names for this tree have included Oregon pine, British Columbian pine, Puget Sound pine, Douglas spruce, false hemlock, red fir, or red pine (although again red pine may refer to a different tree species, \"Pinus resinosa\", and red fir may refer to \"Abies magnifica\").\nOne Coast Salish name for the tree, used in the Halkomelem language, is . In the Lushootseed language, the tree is called .\nDistribution.\n\"Pseudotsuga menziesii\" var. \"menziesii\", the coast Douglas-fir, grows in the coastal regions from west-central British Columbia southward to Central California. In Oregon and Washington, its range is continuous from the eastern edge of the Cascades west to the Pacific Coast Ranges and Pacific Ocean. In California, it is found in the Klamath and California Coast Ranges as far south as the Santa Lucia Range, with a small stand as far south as the Purisima Hills in Santa Barbara County. One of the last remaining old growth stands of conifers is in the Mattole Watershed, and is under threat of logging. In the Sierra Nevada, it ranges as far south as the Yosemite region. It occurs from sea level along the coast to elevations of or higher, and inland in some cases up to .\nAnother variety exists further inland, \"Pseudotsuga menziesii\" var. \"glauca\", the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir or interior Douglas-fir. Interior Douglas-fir intergrades with coast Douglas-fir in the Cascades of northern Washington and southern British Columbia, and from there ranges northward to central British Columbia and southeastward to the Mexican border, becoming increasingly disjunct as latitude decreases and altitude increases. Mexican Douglas-fir (\"P.\u00a0lindleyana\"), which ranges as far south as Oaxaca, is often considered a variety of \"P.\u00a0menziesii\".\nFossils (wood, pollen) of \"Pseudotsuga\" are recorded from the Miocene and Pliocene of Europe (Siebengebirge, Gleiwitz, Austria).\nIt is also naturalised throughout Europe, Argentina and Chile (called \"Pino Oreg\u00f3n\"). In New Zealand it is considered to be an invasive species, called a wilding conifer, and is subject to control measures. But is also one of the most common lumber trees used in forestry alongside Radiata pine with large plantations throughout the country. The species was introduced in the 20th century for its wood.\nEcology.\nPreferred sites.\nDouglas-fir prefers acidic or neutral soils, such as Olympic soil. However, it exhibits considerable morphological plasticity, and on drier sites \"P. menziesii\" var. \"menziesii\" will generate deeper taproots. \"Pseudotsuga menziesii\" var. \"glauca\" exhibits even greater plasticity, occurring in stands of interior temperate rainforest in British Columbia, as well as at the edge of semi-arid sagebrush steppe throughout much of its range, where it generates even deeper taproots still.\nThe coast Douglas-fir variety is the dominant tree west of the Cascade Mountains in the Pacific Northwest. It occurs in nearly all forest types and competes well on most parent materials, aspects, and slopes. Adapted to a more moist, mild climate than the interior subspecies, it grows larger and faster than Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. Associated trees include western hemlock, Sitka spruce, sugar pine, western white pine, ponderosa pine, grand fir, coast redwood, western redcedar, California incense-cedar, Lawson's cypress, tanoak, bigleaf maple and several others. Pure stands are also common, particularly north of the Umpqua River in Oregon. It is most dominant in areas with a more frequent fire regime that suppresses less fire-resistant conifers.\nUse by animals.\nDouglas-fir seeds are an extremely important food source for small mammals such as moles, shrews, and chipmunks, which consume an estimated 65% of each annual seed crop. The Douglas squirrel harvests and hoards great quantities of Douglas-fir cones, and also consumes mature pollen cones, the inner bark, terminal shoots, and developing young needles.\nMature or \"old-growth\" Douglas-fir forest is the primary habitat of the red tree vole (\"Arborimus longicaudus\") and the spotted owl (\"Strix occidentalis\"). Home range requirements for breeding pairs of spotted owls are at least of old growth. Red tree voles may also be found in immature forests if Douglas-fir is a significant component. The red vole nests almost exclusively in the foliage of the trees, typically above the ground, and its diet consists chiefly of Douglas-fir needles.\nDouglas-fir needles are generally poor browse for ungulates, although in the winter when other food sources are lacking it can become important, and black-tailed deer browse new seedlings and saplings in spring and summer. The spring diet of the blue grouse features Douglas-fir needles prominently.\nThe leaves are also used by the woolly conifer aphid \"Adelges cooleyi\"; this 0.5\u00a0mm-long sap-sucking insect is conspicuous on the undersides of the leaves by the small white \"fluff spots\" of protective wax that it produces. It is often present in large numbers, and can cause the foliage to turn yellowish from the damage it causes. Exceptionally, trees may be partially defoliated by it, but the damage is rarely this severe. Among Lepidoptera, apart from some that feed on \"Pseudotsuga\" in general, the gelechiid moths \"Chionodes abella\" and \"C.\u00a0periculella\" as well as the cone scale-eating tortrix moth \"Cydia illutana\" have been recorded specifically on \"P.\u00a0menziesii\".\nThe inner bark is the primary winter food for the North American porcupine.\nPoriol is a flavanone, a type of flavonoid, produced by \"P. menziesii\" in reaction to infection by \"Poria weirii\".\nValue to other plants.\nA parasitic plant which uses \"P. menziesii\" is the Douglas-fir dwarf mistletoe (\"Arceuthobium douglasii\"). Epiphytes such as crustose lichens and mosses are common sights on Douglas-firs. As it is only moderately shade tolerant, undisturbed Douglas-fir stands in humid areas will eventually give way to later successional, more shade-tolerant associates such as the western redcedar and western hemlock\u2014though this process may take a thousand years or more. It is more shade tolerant than some associated fire-dependent species, such as western larch and ponderosa pine, and often replaces these species further inland.\nDiseases and insects.\nFungal diseases such as laminated root rot and shoestring root-rot can cause significant damage, and in plantation settings dominated by Douglas-fir monocultures may cause extreme damage to vast swathes of trees. Interplanting with resistant or nonhost species such as western redcedar and beaked hazelnut can reduce this risk. Other threats to Douglas-fir include red ring rot and the Douglas-fir beetle.\nUses.\nMany different Native American groups used the bark, resin, and needles to make herbal treatments for various diseases. Native Hawaiians built \"wa\u02bba kaulua\" (double-hulled canoes) from coast Douglas-fir logs that had drifted ashore. The wood has historically been favored as firewood, especially from the coastal variety. In addition early settlers used Douglas-fir for all forms of building construction, including floors, beams, and fine carving.\nThe species is extensively used in forestry management as a plantation tree for softwood timber. Douglas-fir is one of the world's best timber-producing species and yields more timber than any other species in North America, making the forestlands of western Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia the most productive on the continent. In 2011, Douglas-fir represented 34.2% of US lumber exports, to a total of 1.053 billion board feet (2,484,803,3 cubic meters). Douglas-fir timber is used for timber frame construction and timber trusses using traditional joinery, veneer, and flooring due to its strength, hardness and durability. As of 2024, the only wooden ships still currently in use by the U.S. Navy in conventional naval operations are \"Avenger\"-class minesweepers, made of Douglas-fir.\nDouglas-fir sees wide use in heavy timber structures, as its wood is strong, available in a number of specifications including kiln dried and grade stamped, and can be supplied in very long lengths to . West coast mills are sophisticated in their processing of timbers, making lead times predictable and availability reliable. Paints adhere well to Douglas-fir. Stains perform well on Douglas-fir timbers with the mild caution that the natural color of this species varies and care must be taken to ensure uniformity of color. Pitch pockets that may ooze resin can be present in timbers that have not been kiln dried. Because of the timber sizes available, stamped timber grading, and relatively short lead times, Douglas-fir sees wide use in both public and residential projects.\nThe species has ornamental value in large parks and gardens. It has been commonly used as a Christmas tree since the 1920s, and the trees are typically grown on plantations.\nThe buds have been used to flavor eau de vie, a clear, colorless fruit brandy. Douglas-fir pine leaves can be used to make pine needle tea. They possess a tangy citrus flavor and may serve in some recipes as a wild substitute for rosemary.\nNotable examples.\nThe immense size and long lifespan of the Douglas fir has produced some acclaimed individual trees. Historical examples include the Lynn Valley Tree near Vancouver, British Columbia and the Nooksack Giant in Maple Falls in Washington State.\nLiving examples in Canada include the Red Creek Fir in the San Juan Valley of Vancouver Island, the largest known Douglas-fir in Canada and one of the largest in the world; the Bonin Giant in the Coquitlam River watershed in British Columbia's Lower Mainland and Big Lonely Doug north of Port Renfrew on Vancouver Island.\nAmerican examples include the Lake Quinault Douglas fir in the Olympic National Forest, Washington State, the largest known Douglas fir in the United States; the Grandma Tree in North Fork Coquille River in Oregon, the second greatest of a living Douglas fir in the United States.; the Queets Fir, in the Olympic National Park in Washington State with the largest known in diameter; and the Doerner Fir fir in Coos County, Oregon.\nOutside of North America, the Hermitage Douglas-fir in Dunkeld, Scotland was one of the tallest trees in the United Kingdom until it fell in 2017 and the Waldtraut of the mill forest, in Freiburg im Breisgau is the tallest tree in Germany.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The range is continuous in the northern Rocky Mountains south to eastern Washington, eastern Oregon, Idaho, western and south-central Montana and western Wyoming, but becomes discontinuous further south, confined to \"sky islands\" on the higher mountains in Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico, with only very isolated small populations in eastern Nevada, westernmost Texas, and northern Mexico. It occurs from 600\u00a0m altitude in the north of the range, up to 3,000\u00a0m, rarely 3,200\u00a0m, in the south. Further west towards the Pacific coast, it is replaced by the related coast Douglas-fir (\"Pseudotsuga menziesii\" var. \"menziesii\"), and to the south, it is replaced by Mexican Douglas-fir in high mountains as far south as Oaxaca. Some botanists have grouped Mexican Douglas-fir with \"P. menziesii\" var. \"glauca\", but genetic and morphological evidence suggest that Mexican populations should be considered a different variety (\"Pseudotsuga menziesii var. lindleyana\").\nRocky Mountain Douglas-fir is most commonly treated as a variety (\"Pseudotsuga menziesii\" var. \"glauca\"), but has also been called a subspecies (\"Pseudotsuga menziesii\" subsp. \"glauca\") or more rarely (mainly in the past) a distinct species (\"Pseudotsuga glauca\"). The strong ecological and genetic differentiation with intergradation limited primarily to postglacial contact zones in British Columbia supports infraspecific groupings. Some botanists have further split Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir into two varieties, but these are not widely acknowledged and have only limited support from genetic testing.\nCharacteristics.\nRocky Mountain Douglas-fir is a large tree, typically reaching in height and in diameter, with exceptional specimens known to tall, and in diameter. It commonly lives more than 500 years and occasionally more than 1,200 years. The bark on young trees is thin, smooth, gray, and covered with resin blisters. On mature trees, it is moderately thick (), furrowed and corky though much less so than coast Douglas-fir.\nThe shoots are brown to gray-brown, smooth, though not as smooth as fir shoots, and finely pubescent with scattered short hairs. The buds are a distinctive narrow conic shape, long, with red-brown bud scales. The leaves are spirally arranged but slightly twisted at the base to be upswept above the shoot, needle-like, long, gray-green to blue-green above with a single broad stomatal patch, and with two whitish stomatal bands below.\nThe male (pollen) cones are long, and are typically restricted to, or more abundant on, lower branches. Pollen cones develop over 1 year and wind-dispersed pollen is released for several weeks in the spring.\nThe mature female seed cones are pendent, long, broad when closed, opening to broad. They are produced in spring, purple (sometimes green) at first, maturing orange-brown in the autumn 5\u20137 months later. The seeds are long and broad, with a wing. Both coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir produce abundant crops of seed approximately every 2\u201311\u00a0years. Seed is produced annually except for about 1 year in any 4-to-5-year period.\nGrowth.\nRocky Mountain Douglas-fir grows more slowly than coast Douglas-fir and is also much more cold tolerant. Tolerance of different environmental conditions varies among populations of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, especially among populations from the northern and southern Rockies. However, even nearby populations can differ in cold hardiness.\nRoot morphology is variable, but when unimpeded, a taproot forms within several years. \"Platelike\" root morphologies occur where growth is impeded. The most prominent lateral roots begin in the 1st or 2nd year of growth. Most roots in surface soil are \"long ropelike laterals of secondary and tertiary origin\". Fine-root production is episodic in response to changing environmental conditions; the average lifespan of fine roots is usually between several days and several weeks.\nRocky Mountain Douglas-fir reaches reproductive maturity at 12\u201315 years. It has winged seeds that are dispersed primarily by wind and gravity. In western Montana clearcuts, seeds were dispersed up to uphill from their source, but seedfall between was only 7% of that found in uncut stands. Other studies determined that seedfall in clearcuts beyond from seed trees was about 3% of seedfall in uncut stands where seed trees are close together. Well-stocked stands have resulted from seedfall from sources distant, but most Douglas-fir seeds fall within of their source. Small amounts of seed are dispersed by mice, chipmunks, and squirrels. Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir seeds are disseminated about twice as far as seeds of ponderosa pine.\nLongevity.\nThe oldest accurately-dated Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, 1275 years old, is in New Mexico. This longevity is apparently uncommon; growing on a relatively barren lava field has protected it from fire, animals, and humans. Growth typically slows dramatically between 90 and 140 years of age.\nIn the dry-belt forests of central British Columbia, ages can exceed 500 years on sites normal for the region. The oldest accurately-dated growth ring available for the region is 1475; dates in the 1500s and 1600s are more common for remnant patches that have escaped logging, fire, and other disturbances.\nPathology.\nIt is affected by the diseases \"Phaeolus schweinitzii\", \"Armillaria\", \"Phellinus weirii\", \"Fomes annosus\", dwarf mistletoe, Dasyscypha canker and Rhabdocline needle cast.\nInsects.\nIt attracts the Douglas fir beetle, western budworm and tussock moth.\nEcology.\nRocky Mountain Douglas-fir grows on a variety of sites across its wide geographic range. It grows at lower elevations adjacent to and within bunchgrass communities and is also found in upper-elevation subalpine forests. It tends to be most abundant in low- and middle-elevation forests, where it grows over a wide range of aspects, slopes, landforms, and soils.\nIn spring and winter (in British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana) elk browse on south- and southwest-facing Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands, particularly when shrubs and/or grasses are productive. In summer, elk generally are found at higher elevations (outside the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and Pacific ponderosa pine zones). During fall, elk use stands of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine, subalpine fir, western larch, or grand fir with high canopy cover.\nIn parts of Yellowstone National Park, elk browsing is so intensive that young Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir are stunted at in height, with live branches trailing very close to the ground, and branches on the upper two thirds of the tree dead. Low-elevation and south-facing open-structure Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir types are often important winter range for white-tailed deer and mule deer. Moose winter in low-elevation Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir types in areas where willow thickets, the preferred winter habitat, are lacking; in such areas Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir is an important moose food.\nChipmunks, mice, voles, and shrews eat large quantities of conifer seeds from the forest floor, and clipped cones are a staple and major part of storage of red squirrels. These animals store a large amount of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir cones or seeds. American marten commonly den in hollow logs.\nNumerous species of songbirds extract seeds from Douglas-fir cones or forage for seeds on the ground. The most common are the Clark's nutcracker, black-capped chickadee, mountain chickadee, boreal chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, pygmy nuthatch, red crossbill, white-winged crossbill, dark-eyed junco, and pine siskin. Migrating flocks of dark-eyed juncos may consume vast quantities of seeds and freshly germinated seedlings. Woodpeckers commonly feed in the bark of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. Blue grouse forage on needles and buds in winter; they and other birds rely heavily on Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir communities for cover.\nThe Douglas-fir is vulnerable to infestation by a woolly aphid, \"Adelges cooleyi\" that also infects the Engelmann spruce to complete its lifecycle.\nUses.\nRocky Mountain Douglas-fir is a valuable timber tree. The wood is exceptionally strong and is used for structural timber as well as poles, plywood, pulp, dimensional lumber, railroad ties, mine timbers, log cabins, posts and poles, fencing, and firewood. Other uses listed include \"machine-stress-rated lumber\", glued-laminated (Glulam) beams, pallets, furniture, cabinets, doors, flooring, window frames, and other miscellaneous woodwork and millwork. Rocky Mountain Douglas-firs are also cut and sold as Christmas trees.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects.\nBorn in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before moving to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the \"Wheeler method\". In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL.\nIn 1934, he established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal University of London, adopting the position of Honorary Director. In this period, he oversaw excavations of the Roman sites at Lydney Park and Verulamium and the Iron Age hill fort of Maiden Castle. During World War II, he re-joined the Armed Forces and rose to the rank of brigadier, serving in the North African Campaign and then the Allied invasion of Italy. In 1944 he was appointed Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, through which he oversaw excavations of sites at Harappa, Arikamedu, and Brahmagiri, and implemented reforms to the subcontinent's archaeological establishment. Returning to Britain in 1948, he divided his time between lecturing for the Institute of Archaeology and acting as archaeological adviser to Pakistan's government. In later life, his popular books, cruise ship lectures, and appearances on radio and television, particularly the BBC series \"Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?\", helped to bring archaeology to a mass audience. Appointed Honorary Secretary of the British Academy, he raised large sums of money for archaeological projects, and was appointed British representative for several UNESCO projects.\nWheeler is recognised as one of the most important British archaeologists of the 20th century, responsible for successfully encouraging British public interest in the discipline and advancing methodologies of excavation and recording. Furthermore, he is widely acclaimed as a major figure in the establishment of South Asian archaeology. However, many of his specific interpretations of archaeological sites have been discredited or reinterpreted.\nEarly life.\nChildhood: 1890\u20131907.\nMortimer Wheeler was born on 10 September 1890 in the city of Glasgow, Scotland. He was the first child of the journalist Robert Mortimer Wheeler and his second wife Emily Wheeler (n\u00e9e Baynes). The son of a tea merchant based in Bristol, in youth Robert had considered becoming a Baptist minister, but instead became a staunch freethinker while studying at the University of Edinburgh. Initially working as a lecturer in English literature, Robert turned to journalism after his first wife died in childbirth. His second wife, Emily, shared her husband's interest in English literature, and was the niece of Thomas Spencer Baynes, a Shakespearean scholar at St. Andrews University. Their marriage was emotionally strained, a situation exacerbated by their financial insecurity. Within two years of their son's birth, the family moved to Edinburgh, where a daughter named Amy was born.\nWhen Wheeler was four, his father was appointed chief leader writer for the \"Bradford Observer\". The family relocated to Saltaire, a village northwest of Bradford, a cosmopolitan city in Yorkshire, northeast England, then in the midst of the wool trade boom. Wheeler was inspired by the moors surrounding Saltaire and fascinated by the area's archaeology. He later wrote about discovering a late prehistoric cup-marked stone, searching for lithics on Ilkley Moor, and digging into a barrow on Baildon Moor. Although in ill health, Emily Wheeler taught her two children with the help of a maid up to the age of seven or eight. Mortimer remained emotionally distant from his mother, instead being far closer to his father, whose company he favoured over that of other children.\nHis father had a keen interest in natural history and a love of fishing and shooting, rural pursuits in which he encouraged Mortimer to take part. Robert acquired many books for his son, particularly on the subject of art history, with Wheeler loving to both read and paint.\nIn 1899, Wheeler joined Bradford Grammar School shortly before his ninth birthday, where he proceeded straight to the second form. In 1902, Robert and Emily had a second daughter, whom they named Betty; Mortimer showed little interest in this younger sister. In 1905, Robert agreed to take over as head of the London office of his newspaper, by then renamed the \"Yorkshire Daily Observer\", so the family relocated to the southeast of the city in December 1905, settling into a house named Carlton Lodge on South Croydon Road, West Dulwich. In 1908, they moved to 14 Rollescourt Avenue in nearby Herne Hill. Rather than being sent for a conventional education, when he was 15 Wheeler was instructed to educate himself by spending time in London, where he frequented the National Gallery and the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nUniversity and early career: 1907\u201314.\nAfter passing the entrance exam on his second attempt, in 1907 Wheeler was awarded a scholarship to read classical studies at University College London (UCL), commuting daily from his parental home to the university campus in Bloomsbury, central London. At UCL, he was taught by the prominent classicist A.\u00a0E. Housman. During his undergraduate studies, he became editor of the \"Union Magazine\", for which he produced a number of illustrated cartoons. Increasingly interested in art, he decided to switch from classical studies to a course at UCL's art school, the Slade School of Fine Art; he returned to his previous subject after coming to the opinion that \u2013 in his words \u2013 he never became more than \"a conventionally accomplished picture maker\". This interlude had adversely affected his classical studies, and he received a second class BA on graduating.\nWheeler began studying for a Master of Arts degree in classical studies, which he attained in 1912. During this period, he also gained employment as the personal secretary of the UCL Provost Gregory Foster, although he later criticised Foster for transforming the university from \"a college in the truly academic sense [into] a hypertrophied monstrosity as little like a college as a plesiosaurus is like a man\". It was also at this time of life that he met and began a relationship with Tessa Verney, a student then studying history at UCL, when they were both serving on the committee of the University College Literary Society.\nDuring his studies, Wheeler had developed his love of archaeology, having joined an excavation of Viroconium Cornoviorum, a Romano-British settlement in Wroxeter, in 1913. Considering a profession in the discipline, he won a studentship that had been established jointly by the University of London and the Society of Antiquaries in memory of Augustus Wollaston Franks. The prominent archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans doubled the amount of money that went with the studentship. Wheeler's proposed project had been to analyse Romano-Rhenish pottery, and with the grant he funded a trip to the Rhineland in Germany, there studying the Roman pottery housed in local museums; his research into this subject was never published.\nAt this period, there were very few jobs available within British archaeology; as the later archaeologist Stuart Piggott related, \"the young Wheeler was looking for a professional job where the profession had yet to be created.\" In 1913 Wheeler secured a position as junior investigator for the English Royal Commission on Historical Monuments, who were embarking on a project to assess the state of all structures in the nation that pre-dated 1714. As part of this, he was first sent to Stebbing in Essex to assess Late Medieval buildings, although once that was accomplished he focused on studying the Romano-British remains of that county. In summer 1914, he married Tessa in a low-key, secular wedding ceremony, before they moved into Wheeler's parental home in Herne Hill.\nFirst World War: 1914\u20131918.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I cannot attempt to describe the conditions under which we are fighting.

If it were not for the cement pill boxes left by the Boche, not a thing could live many hours.\"\n\u2014 Wheeler, in a letter to his wife, October 1917\nAfter the United Kingdom's entry into World War I in 1914, Wheeler volunteered for the armed forces. Although preferring solitary to group activities, Wheeler found that he greatly enjoyed soldiering, and on 9 November 1914 was commissioned a temporary second lieutenant in the University of London Officer Training Corps, serving with its artillery unit as an instructor. It was during this period, in January 1915, that a son was born to the Wheelers, and named Michael. Michael Wheeler was their only child, something that was a social anomaly at the time, although it is unknown whether or not this was by choice. In May 1915, Wheeler transferred to the 1st Lowland Brigade of the Royal Field Artillery (Territorial Force), and was confirmed in his rank on 1 July, with a promotion to temporary lieutenant from the same date. Shortly thereafter, on 16 July, Wheeler was promoted to temporary captain. In this position he was stationed at various bases across Britain, often bringing his wife and child with him; his responsibility was as a battery commander, initially of field guns and later of howitzers.\nIn October 1917 Wheeler was posted to the 76th Army Field Artillery Brigade, one of the Royal Field Artillery brigades under the direct control of the General Officer Commanding, Third Army. The brigade was then stationed in Belgium, where it had been engaged in the Battle of Passchendaele against German troops along the Western Front. By now a substantive lieutenant (temporary captain), on 7 October he was appointed second-in-command of an artillery battery with the acting rank of captain, but on 21 October became commander of a battery with the acting rank of major, replacing a major who had been poisoned by mustard gas. He was part of the Left Group of artillery covering the advancing Allied infantry in the battle. Throughout, he maintained correspondences with his wife, his sister Amy, and his parents. After the Allied victory in the battle, the brigade was transferred to Italy.\nWheeler and the brigade arrived in Italy on 20 November, and proceeded through the Italian Riviera to reach Caporetto, where it had been sent to bolster the Italian troops against a German and Austro-Hungarian advance. As the Russian Republic removed itself from the war, the German Army refocused its efforts on the Western Front, so in March 1918 Wheeler's brigade was ordered to leave Italy, getting a train from Castelfranco to Vieux Rouen in France. Back on the Western Front, the brigade was assigned to the 2nd Division, again part of Julian Byng's Third Army, reaching a stable area of the front in April. Here, Wheeler was engaged in artillery fire for several months, before the British went on the offensive in August. On 24 August, between the ruined villages of Achiet and Sapignies, he led an expedition that captured two German field guns while under heavy fire from a castle mound; he was later awarded the Military Cross for this action:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For conspicuous gallantry and initiative. While making a reconnaissance he saw two enemy field guns limbered up without horses within 300 yards of the outpost line. He returned for two six-horse teams, and under heavy fire, in full view of the enemy, successfully brought back both guns to his battery position and turned them on the enemy. He did fine work.\nWheeler continued as part of the British forces pushing westward until the German surrender in November 1918, receiving a mention in dispatches on 8 November. He was not demobilised for several months, instead being stationed at Pulheim in Germany until March; during this time he wrote up his earlier research on Romano-Rhenish pottery, making use of access to local museums, before returning to London in July 1919. Reverting to his permanent rank of lieutenant on 16 September, Wheeler was finally discharged from service on 30 September 1921, retaining the rank of major.\nCareer.\nNational Museum of Wales: 1919\u20131926.\nOn returning to London, Wheeler moved into a top-floor flat near Gordon Square with his wife and child. He returned to working for the Royal Commission, examining and cataloguing the historic structures of Essex. In doing so, he produced his first publication, an academic paper on Colchester's Roman Balkerne Gate which was published in the \"Transactions of the Essex Archaeological Society\" in 1920. He soon followed this with two papers in the \"Journal of Roman Studies\"; the first offered a wider analysis of Roman Colchester, while the latter outlined his discovery of the vaulting for the city's Temple of Claudius which was destroyed by Boudica's revolt. In doing so, he developed a reputation as a Roman archaeologist in Britain. He then submitted his research on Romano-Rhenish pots to the University of London, on the basis of which he was awarded his Doctorate of Letters; thenceforth until his knighthood he styled himself as Dr Wheeler. He was unsatisfied with his job in the commission, unhappy that he was receiving less pay and a lower status than he had had in the army, so began to seek alternative employment.\nHe obtained a post as the Keeper of Archaeology at the National Museum of Wales, a job that also entailed becoming a lecturer in archaeology at the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire. Taking up this position, he moved to Cardiff with his family in August 1920, although he initially disliked the city. The museum was in disarray; before the war, construction had begun on a new purpose-built building to house the collections. This had ceased during the conflict and the edifice was left abandoned during Cardiff's post-war economic slump. Wheeler recognised that Wales was very divided regionally, with many Welsh people having little loyalty to Cardiff; thus, he made a point of touring the country, lecturing to local societies about archaeology. According to the later archaeologist Lydia C. Carr, the Wheelers' work for the cause of the museum was part of a wider \"cultural-nationalist movement\" linked to growing Welsh nationalism during this period; for instance, the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru was founded in 1925.\nWheeler was impatient to start excavations, and in July 1921 started a six-week project to excavate at the Roman fort of Segontium; accompanied by his wife, he used up his holiday to oversee the project. A second season of excavation at the site followed in 1922. Greatly influenced by the writings of the archaeologist Augustus Pitt-Rivers, Wheeler emphasised the need for a strong, developed methodology when undertaking an archaeological excavation, believing in the need for strategic planning, or what he termed \"controlled discovery\", with clear objectives in mind for a project. Further emphasising the importance of prompt publication of research results, he wrote full seasonal reports for \"Archaeologia Cambrensis\" before publishing a full report, \"Segontium and the Roman Occupation of Wales\". Wheeler was keen on training new generations of archaeologists, and two of the most prominent students to excavate with him at Segontium were Victor Nash-Williams and Ian Richmond.\nOver the field seasons of 1924 and 1925, Wheeler ran excavations of the Roman fort of Y Gaer near Brecon, a project aided by his wife and two archaeological students, Nowell Myres and Christopher Hawkes. During this project, he was visited by the prominent Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie and his wife Hilda Petrie; Wheeler greatly admired Petrie's emphasis on strong archaeological methodologies. Wheeler published the results of his excavation in \"The Roman Fort Near Brecon\". He then began excavations at Isca Augusta, a Roman site in Caerleon, where he focused on revealing the Roman amphitheatre. Intent on attracting press attention to both raise public awareness of archaeology and attract new sources of funding, he contacted the press and organised a sponsorship of the excavation by the middle-market newspaper the \"Daily Mail\". In doing so, he emphasised the folkloric and legendary associations that the site had with King Arthur. In 1925, Oxford University Press published Wheeler's first book for a general audience, \"Prehistoric and Roman Wales\"; he later expressed the opinion that it was not a good book.\nIn 1924, the Director of the National Museum of Wales, William Evans Hoyle, resigned amid ill health. Wheeler applied to take on the role of his replacement, providing supportive testimonials from Charles Reed Peers, Robert Bosanquet, and H. J. Fleure. Although he had no prior museum experience, he was successful in his application and was appointed director. He then employed a close friend, Cyril Fox, to take on the vacated position of Keeper of Archaeology. Wheeler's proposed reforms included extending the institution's reach and influence throughout Wales by building affiliations with regional museums, and focusing on fundraising to finance the completion of the new museum premises. He obtained a \u00a321,367 donation from the wealthy shipowner William Reardon Smith and appointed Smith to be the museum's treasurer, and also travelled to Whitehall, London, where he successfully urged the British Treasury to provide further funding for the museum. As a result, construction on the museum's new building was able to continue, and it was officially opened by King George V in 1927.\nLondon Museum: 1926\u20131933.\nUpon the retirement of the Keeper of the London Museum, Harmon Oates, Wheeler was invited to fill the vacancy. He had been considering a return to London for some time and eagerly agreed, taking on the post, which was based at Lancaster House in the St James's area, in July 1926. In Wales, many felt that Wheeler had simply taken the directorship of the National Museum to advance his own career prospects, and that he had abandoned them when a better offer came along. Wheeler himself disagreed, believing that he had left Fox at the Museum as his obvious successor, and that the reforms he had implemented would therefore continue. The position initially provided Wheeler with an annual salary of \u00a3600, which resulted in a decline in living standards for his family, who moved into a flat near Victoria Station.\nTessa's biographer L. C. Carr later commented that together, the Wheelers \"professionalized the London Museum\". Wheeler expressed his opinion that the museum \"had to be cleaned, expurgated, and catalogued; in general, turned from a junk shop into a tolerably rational institution\". Focusing on reorganising the exhibits and developing a more efficient method of cataloguing the artefacts, he also wrote \"A Short Guide to the Collections\", before using the items in the museum to write three books: \"London and the Vikings\", \"London and the Saxons\", and \"London and the Romans\". Upon his arrival, the Treasury allocated the museum an annual budget of \u00a35,000, which Wheeler deemed insufficient for its needs. In 1930, Wheeler persuaded them to increase that budget, as he highlighted increasing visitor numbers, publications, and acquisitions, as well as a rise in the number of educational projects. With this additional funding, he was able to employ more staff and increase his own annual salary to \u00a3900.\nSoon after joining the museum, Wheeler was elected to the council of the Society of Antiquaries. Through the Society, he became involved in the debate as to who should finance archaeological supervision of building projects in Greater London; his argument was that the City of London Corporation should provide the funding, although in 1926 it was agreed that the Society itself would employ a director of excavation based in Lancaster House to take on the position. Also involved in the largely moribund Royal Archaeological Institute, Wheeler organised its relocation to Lancaster House. In 1927, Wheeler took on an unpaid lectureship at University College London, where he established a graduate diploma course on archaeology; one of the first to enroll was Stuart Piggott. In 1928, Wheeler curated an exhibit at UCL on \"Recent Work in British Archaeology\", for which he attracted much press attention.\nWheeler was keen to continue archaeological fieldwork outside London, undertaking excavations every year from 1926 to 1939. After completing his excavation of the Carlaeon amphitheatre in 1928, he began fieldwork at the Roman settlement and temple in Lydney Park, Gloucestershire, having been invited to do so by the aristocratic landowner, Charles Bathurst. It was during these investigations that Wheeler personally discovered the Lydney Hoard of coinage. Wheeler and his wife jointly published their excavation report in 1932 as \"Report on the Excavation of the Prehistoric, Roman and Post-Roman Site in Lydney Park, Gloucestershire\", which Piggott noted had \"set the pattern\" for all Wheeler's future excavation reports.\nFrom there, Wheeler was invited to direct a Society of Antiquaries excavation at the Roman settlement of Verulamium, which existed on land recently acquired by the Corporation of St Albans. He took on this role for four seasons from 1930 to 1933, before leaving a fifth season of excavation under the control of the archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon and the architect A. W. G. Lowther. Wheeler enjoyed the opportunity to excavate at a civilian as opposed to military site, and also liked its proximity to his home in London. He was particularly interested in searching for a pre-Roman Iron Age oppidum at the site, noting that the existence of a nearby Catuvellauni settlement was attested to in both classical texts and numismatic evidence. With Wheeler focusing his attention on potential Iron Age evidence, Tessa concentrated on excavating the inside of the city walls; Wheeler had affairs with at least three assistants during the project. After Tessa wrote two interim reports, the final excavation report was finally published in 1936 as \"Verulamium: A Belgic and Two Roman Cities\", jointly written by Wheeler and his wife. The report resulted in the first major published criticism of Wheeler, produced by the young archaeologist Nowell Myres in a review for \"Antiquity\"; although stating that there was much to praise about the work, he critiqued Wheeler's selective excavation, dubious dating, and guesswork. Wheeler responded with a piece in which he defended his work and launched a personal attack on both Myres and Myres's employer, Christ Church, Oxford.\nInstitute of Archaeology: 1934\u20131939.\nWheeler had long desired to establish an academic institution devoted to archaeology that could be based in London. He hoped that it could become a centre in which to establish the professionalisation of archaeology as a discipline, with systematic training of students in methodological techniques of excavation and conservation and recognised professional standards; in his words, he hoped \"to convert archaeology into a discipline worthy of that name in all senses\". He further described his intention that the Institute should become \"a laboratory: a laboratory of archaeological science\".\nMany archaeologists shared his hopes, and to this end Petrie had donated much of his collection of Near Eastern artefacts to Wheeler, in the hope that it would be included in such an institution.\nWheeler was later able to persuade the University of London, a federation of institutions across the capital, to support the venture, and both he and Tessa began raising funds from wealthy backers. In 1934, the Institute of Archaeology was officially opened, albeit at this point without premises or academic staff; the first students to enroll were Rachel Clay and Barbara Parker, who went on to have careers in the discipline.\nWhile Wheeler \u2013 who was still Keeper of the London Museum \u2013 took on the role of Honorary Director of the institute, he installed the archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon as secretary of the Management Committee, describing her as \"a level-headed person, with useful experience\". That June, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Saint John (OStJ).\nAfter ending his work at Verulamium, Wheeler turned his attention to the late Iron Age hill-fort of Maiden Castle near Dorchester, Dorset, where he excavated for four seasons from 1934 to 1937. Co-directed by Mortimer and Tessa Wheeler, and the Curator of Dorset County Museum (Charles Drew), the project was carried out under the joint auspices of the Society of Antiquaries and the Dorset Field Club. With around 100 assistants each season, the dig constituted the largest excavation that had been conducted in Britain up to that point, with Wheeler organising weekly meetings with the press to inform them about any discoveries. He was keen to emphasise that his workforce consisted of many young people as well as both men and women, thus presenting the image of archaeology as a modern and advanced discipline. According to later historian Adam Stout, the Maiden Castle excavation was \"one of the most famous British archaeological investigations of the twentieth century. It was the classic 'Wheeler dig', both in terms of scale of operations and the publicity which it generated.\"\nWheeler's excavation report was published in 1943 as \"Maiden Castle, Dorset\". The report's publication allowed further criticism to be voiced of Wheeler's approach and interpretations; in his review of the book, the archaeologist W. F. Grimes criticised the highly selective nature of the excavation, noting that Wheeler had not asked questions regarding the socio-economic issues of the community at Maiden Castle, aspects of past societies that had come to be of increasing interest to British archaeology. Over coming decades, as further excavations were carried out at the site and archaeologists developed a greater knowledge of Iron Age Britain, much of Wheeler's interpretation of the site and its development was shown to be wrong, in particular by the work of the archaeologist Niall Sharples.\nIn 1936, Wheeler embarked on a visit to the Near East, sailing from Marseille to Port Said, where he visited the Old Kingdom tombs of Sakkara. From there he went via Sinai to Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria. During this trip, he visited various archaeological projects, but was dismayed by the quality of their excavations; in particular, he noted that the American-run excavation at Tel Megiddo was adopting standards that had been rejected in Britain twenty-five years previously. He was away for six weeks, and upon his return to Europe discovered that his wife Tessa had died of a pulmonary embolism after a minor operation on her toe. According to Tessa's biographer, for Wheeler this discovery was \"the peak of mental misery, and marked the end of his ability to feel a certain kind of love\". That winter, his father also died. By the summer of 1937, he had embarked on a new romance, with a young woman named Mavis de Vere Cole, widow of Horace de Vere Cole, who had first met Wheeler when visiting the Maiden Castle excavations with her then-lover, the painter Augustus John. After she eventually agreed to his repeated proposals, the two were married early in 1939 in a ceremony held at Caxton Hall, with a reception at Shelley House. They proceeded on a honeymoon to the Middle East.\nAfter a search that had taken several years, Wheeler was able to secure premises for the Institute of Archaeology: St. John's Lodge in Regent's Park, central London. Left empty since its use as a hospital during the First World War, the building was owned by the Crown and was controlled by the First Commissioner of Works, William Ormsby-Gore; he was very sympathetic to archaeology, and leased the building to the Institute at a low rent. The St. John's Lodge premises were officially opened on 29 April 1937. During his speech at the ceremony, the University of London's Vice-Chancellor Charles Reed Peers made it clear that the building was only intended as a temporary home for the institute, which it was hoped would be able to move to Bloomsbury, the city's academic hub. In his speech, the university's Chancellor, Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone, compared the new institution to both the Institute of Historical Research and the Courtauld Institute of Art.\nWheeler had also become President of the Museums Association, and in a presidential address given in Belfast talked on the topic of preserving museum collections in wartime, believing that Britain's involvement in a second European conflict was imminent. In anticipation of this event, in August 1939 he arranged for the London Museum to place many of its most important collections into safe keeping. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate from Bristol University, and at the award ceremony met the Conservative Party politician Winston Churchill, who was then engaged in writing his multi-volume \"A History of the English-Speaking Peoples\"; Churchill asked Wheeler to help him in writing about late prehistoric and early medieval Britain, to which Wheeler agreed.\nAfter Maiden Castle, Wheeler turned his attention to France, where the archaeological investigation of Iron Age sites had lagged behind developments in Britain. There, he oversaw a series of surveys and excavations with the aid of Leslie Scott, beginning with a survey tour of Brittany in the winter of 1936\u201337. After this, Wheeler decided to excavate the oppidum at Camp d'Artus, near Huelgoat, Finist\u00e8re. In addition to bringing many British archaeologists to work on the site, he hired six local Breton workmen to assist the project, coming to the belief that the oppidum had been erected by local Iron Age tribes to defend themselves from the Roman invasion led by Julius Caesar. Meanwhile, Scott had been placed in charge of an excavation at the smaller nearby hill fort of Kercaradec, near Quimper. In July 1939, the project focused its attention on Normandy, with excavations beginning at the Iron Age hill forts of Camp de Canada and Duclair. They were brought to an abrupt halt in September 1939 as the Second World War broke out in Europe, and the team evacuated back to Britain. Wheeler's excavation report, co-written with Katherine Richardson, was eventually published as \"Hill-forts of Northern France\" in 1957.\nSecond World War: 1939\u20131945.\nWheeler had been expecting and openly hoping for war with Nazi Germany for a year before the outbreak of hostilities; he believed that the United Kingdom's involvement in the conflict would remedy the shame that he thought had been brought upon the country by its signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938. Volunteering for the armed services, on 18 July 1939 he returned to active service as a major (Special List). He was assigned to assemble the 48th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery at Enfield, where he set about recruiting volunteers, including his son Michael. As the 48th swelled in size, it was converted into the 42nd Mobile Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment in the Royal Artillery, which consisted of four batteries and was led by Wheeler \u2013 now promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel (effective 27 January 1940) \u2013 as Commanding Officer. Given the nickname of \"Flash Alf\" by those serving under him, he was recognised by colleagues as a ruthless disciplinarian and was blamed by many for the death of one of his soldiers from influenza during training. Having been appointed secretary of the Society of Antiquaries in 1939 and then director in 1940, he travelled to London to deal with society affairs on various occasions. In 1941 Wheeler was awarded a Fellowship of the British Academy. Mavis de Vere Cole \u2013 Wheeler's wife, had meanwhile entered into an affair with a man named Clive Entwistle, who lambasted Wheeler as \"that whiskered baboon\". When Wheeler discovered Entwistle in bed with her, he initiated divorce proceedings that were finalised in March 1942.\nIn the summer of 1941, Wheeler and three of his batteries were assigned to fight against German and Italian forces in the North African Campaign. In September, they set sail from Glasgow aboard the RMS \"Empress of Russia\"; because the Mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces, they were forced to travel via the Cape of Good Hope, before taking shore leave in Durban. There, Wheeler visited the local kraals to compare them with the settlements of Iron Age Britain. The ship docked in Aden, where Wheeler and his men again took shore leave. They soon reached the British-controlled Suez, where they disembarked and were stationed on the shores of the Great Bitter Lake. There, Wheeler took a brief leave of absence to travel to Jerusalem, where he visited Petrie on his hospital deathbed. Back in Egypt, he gained permission to fly as a front gunner in a Wellington bomber on a bombing raid against Axis forces, to better understand what it was like for aircrew to be fired on by an anti-aircraft battery.\nServing with the Eighth Army, Wheeler was present in North Africa when the Axis armies pushed the Allies back to El Alamein. He was also part of the Allied counter-push, taking part in the Second Battle of El Alamein and the advance on Axis-held Tripoli. On the way he became concerned that the archaeological sites of North Africa were being threatened both by the fighting and the occupying forces. After the British secured control of Libya, Wheeler visited Tripoli and Leptis Magna, where he found that Roman remains had been damaged and vandalised by British troops; he brought about reforms to prevent this, lecturing to the troops on the importance of preserving archaeology, making many monuments out-of-bounds, and ensuring that the Royal Air Force changed its plans to construct a radar station in the midst of a Roman settlement. Aware that the British were planning to invade and occupy the Italian island of Sicily, he insisted that measures be introduced to preserve the historic and archaeological monuments on the island.\nPromoted to the acting rank of brigadier on 1 May 1943, after the German surrender in North Africa, Wheeler was sent to Algiers where he was part of the staff committee planning the invasion of Italy. There, he learned that the India Office had requested that the army relieve him of his duties to permit him to be appointed Director General of Archaeology in India. Although he had never been to the country, he agreed that he would take the job on the condition that he be permitted to take part in the invasion of Italy first. As intended, Wheeler and his 12th Anti-Aircraft Brigade then took part in the invasion of Sicily and then mainland Italy, where they were ordered to use their anti-aircraft guns to protect the British 10th Corps. As the Allies advanced north through Italy, Wheeler spent time in Naples and then Capri, where he met various aristocrats who had anti-fascist sympathies.\nWheeler left Italy in November 1943 and returned to London. There, he resigned as the director of the London Museum and focused on organising the Institute of Archaeology, preparing it for its adoption of a new director, V. Gordon Childe, after the war. He also resigned as director of the Society of Antiquaries, but was appointed the group's representative to the newly formed Council for British Archaeology. He developed a relationship with a woman named Kim Collingridge, and asked her to marry him. As she was a devout Roman Catholic, he officially converted to the religion, something which shocked many of his friends, who believed that he was being dishonest because he did not genuinely believe in the doctrines of the faith. He then set sail for Bombay aboard a transport ship, the \"City of Exeter\", in February 1944.\nArchaeological Survey of India: 1944\u20131948.\nWheeler arrived in Bombay in the spring of 1944. There, he was welcomed by the city's governor, John Colville, before heading by train to Delhi and then Shimla, where the headquarters of the Archaeological Survey of India were located. Wheeler had been suggested for the job by Archibald Wavell, the Viceroy of India, who had been acting on the recommendations of the archaeologist Leonard Woolley, who had written a report lamenting the state of the archaeological establishment in the British-controlled subcontinent. Wheeler recognised this state of affairs, in a letter to a friend complaining about the lack of finances and equipment, commenting that \"We're back in 1850\". He initially found much to dislike in India, and in his letters to friends in Britain expressed derogatory and racist sentiments toward Indians: he stated that \"they feed wrongly and think wrongly and live wrongly\u00a0... I already find myself regarding them as ill-made clockwork toys rather than as human beings, and I find myself bullying them most brutally.\" He expelled those staff members whom he deemed too idle, and physically beat others in an attempt to motivate them.\nFrom the beginning of his tenure, he sought to distance himself from previous Directors-General and their administrations by criticising them in print and attempting to introduce new staff who had no loyalty to his predecessors. Assigned a four-year contract, Wheeler attempted to recruit two archaeologists from Britain, Glyn Daniel and Stuart Piggott, to aid him in reforming the Archaeological Survey, although they declined the offer. He then toured the subcontinent, seeking to meet all of the Survey's staff members. He had drawn up a prospectus containing research questions that he wanted the Survey to focus on; these included understanding the period between the Bronze Age Indus Valley civilization and the Achaemenid Empire, discerning the socio-cultural background to the Vedas, dating the Aryan invasion, and establishing a dating system for southern India before the 6th century CE. During his time in office he also achieved a 25 per cent budget increase for the Archaeological Survey, and convinced the government to agree to the construction of a National Museum of Archaeology, to be built in New Delhi.\nIn October 1944, he opened his six-month archaeological field school in Taxila, where he instructed various students from across India in the methodologies of the discipline. Wheeler became very fond of his students, with one of them, B. B. Lal, later commenting that \"behind the gruff exterior, Sir Mortimer had a very kind and sympathetic heart\". Throughout his period in India, his students were some of the only individuals to whom Wheeler warmed; more widely, he was annoyed by what he saw as the idleness, incompetence and corruption of Indian society. Initially focusing on the northwest of the subcontinent, Wheeler was particularly fascinated by the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization. On his initial inspection of the Indus Valley sites of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, he organised a very brief excavation which revealed fortifications around both settlements. He later led a more detailed excavation at Harappa, where he exposed further fortifications and established a stratigraphy for the settlement.\nTurning his attention to southern India, Wheeler discovered remnants of a Roman amphora in a museum, and began excavations at Arikamedu, revealing a port from the 1st century CE that had traded in goods from the Roman Empire. The excavation had been plagued by severe rains and tropical heat, although it was during the excavation that World War II ended; in celebration, Wheeler gave all his workers an extra rupee for the day. It has since been alleged that while Wheeler took credit for discovering the significance of this site, it had previously been established by A. Aiyappan, the Superintendent of the Government Museum in Madras, and the French archaeologist Jouveau Dubreuil, with Wheeler intentionally ignoring their contribution. He later undertook excavations of six megalithic tombs in Brahmagiri, Mysore, which enabled him to gain a chronology for the archaeology of much of southern India.\nWheeler established a new archaeological journal, \"Ancient India\", planning for it to be published twice a year. He had trouble securing printing paper and faced various delays; the first issue was released in January 1946, and he would release three further volumes during his stay. Wheeler married Kim Collingridge in Simla, before he and his wife took part in an Indian Cultural Mission to Iran. The Indian government had deemed Wheeler ideal to lead the group, which departed via train to Zahidan before visiting Persepolis, Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, Pasargadae, and Kashan. Wheeler enjoyed the trip, and was envious of Tehran's archaeological museum and library, which was far in advance of anything then found in India. Crossing into Iraq, in Baghdad the team caught a flight back to Delhi. In 1946, he was involved in a second cultural mission, this time to Afghanistan, where he expressed a particular interest in the kingdom of ancient Bactria and visited the archaeology of Balkh.\nWheeler was present during the 1947 Partition of India into the Dominion of Pakistan and the Union of India and the accompanying ethnic violence between Hindu and Muslim communities. He was unhappy with how these events had affected the Archaeological Survey, complaining that some of his finest students and staff were now citizens of Pakistan and no longer able to work for him. He was based in New Delhi when the city was rocked by sectarian violence, and attempted to help many of his Muslim staff members escape from the Hindu-majority city unharmed. He further helped smuggle Muslim families out of the city hospital, where they had taken refuge from a violent Hindu mob. As India neared independence from the British Empire, the political situation had changed significantly; by October 1947 he was one of the last British individuals in a senior position in the country's governing establishment, and recognised that many Indian nationalists wanted him to leave as well. For his work in India, Wheeler was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in the final imperial honours list issued the day before Indian independence (gazetted in the 1948 New Year Honours).\nAs their relationship had become increasingly strained, his wife had left and returned to Britain. Although hoping to leave his post in India several months early, he was concerned for his economic prospects, and desperately searched for a new position. Through friends in the British archaeological community, he was offered a job as the Secretary of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, although he was upset that this would mean a drop in his professional status and income and decided to turn it down. Instead, he agreed to take up a chair in the Archaeology of the Roman Provinces at the Institute of Archaeology. In addition, the Pakistani Minister of Education invited him to become the Archaeological Adviser to the Pakistani government; he agreed also to take up this position, on the condition that he would only spend several months in the country each year over the next three. On 1 September 1948, having exceeded the age limit, he relinquished his Territorial Army commission, ending his military service as a war-substantive lieutenant-colonel (honorary brigadier). He was awarded the Territorial Decoration (TD) in September 1956.\nLater life.\nBetween Britain and Pakistan: 1948\u20131952.\nReturning to London, Wheeler moved into the Hallam Street flat where his son and daughter-in-law were living. Wheeler and the latter disliked each other, so in summer 1950 he moved out and began renting an apartment in Mount Street. A year later he moved into his wife's house in Mallord Street, in an unsuccessful hope of reigniting their relationship.\nTaking up his part-time professorship at the Institute of Archaeology, he began to lecture to students almost every day. There, he found that he developed a relationship of mutual respect with the director, Childe, despite their strong personal and professional differences. In April 1949, after the retirement of Cyril Fox, Wheeler was nominated for the Presidency of the Society of Antiquaries, but lost to James Mann; many archaeologists, including Childe and O. G. S. Crawford, resigned from the Society in protest, deeming Wheeler to have been a far more appropriate candidate for the position. Wheeler was nevertheless elected director of the Society. In 1950 he was awarded the Petrie Medal, and was knighted in the 1952 Birthday Honours, with his investiture by the Queen taking place at Buckingham Palace on 8 July. That same year he was invited to give the Norton lectures for the Archaeological Institute of America, and while in the United States was also awarded the Lucy Wharton Drexel medal at Pennsylvania. He nevertheless disliked the country, and in later life exhibited anti-Americanism.\nWheeler spent three months in the Dominion of Pakistan during early 1949, where he was engaged in organising the fledgling Pakistani Archaeological Department with the aid of former members of the Archaeological Survey and new students whom he recruited. The Minister of Education, Fazlur Rahman, was sympathetic to Wheeler's plans, and the government agreed to establish a National Museum of Pakistan in Karachi, which opened in April 1950. Wheeler himself was appointed the first President of the Pakistani Museums Association, and found himself as a mediator in the arguments between India and Pakistan over the redistribution of archaeological and historic artefacts following the partition. He also wrote a work of archaeological propaganda for the newly formed state, \"Five Thousand Years of Pakistan\" (1950).\nTo instruct new Pakistani students in the methods of archaeology, in early 1950 Wheeler ran a training excavation at Mohenjo-daro; there, he was joined by the British student Leslie Alcock, who spoke both Punjabi and Urdu and who was appointed a site supervisor by Wheeler. This excavation proved to be the only one for which Wheeler would not write and publish a full excavation report. Instead, he made reference to its findings in his book \"The Indus Civilization\", published as part of the series The Cambridge History of India. His relationship with the Pakistani government had become strained, so he declined to return to work for them for a third year.\nWheeler had been keen to return to excavation in Britain. Based on the one he had organised in India, Wheeler developed an archaeological training course, which he ran at Verulamium in the summer of 1949 to instruct British students in the methodologies of excavation. In summer 1950, he was invited by the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments to direct a trial excavation at Bindon Hill in Dorset. It was a leisurely project which he treated as a seaside holiday. He was invited by the Ancient Monuments Department of the Ministry of Works to excavate the Stanwick Iron Age Fortifications in North Riding, Yorkshire, which he proceeded to do over the summers of 1951 and 1952. Aided by many old friends and colleagues from within the British archaeological scene, he was joined by Alcock and Alcock's wife, among others. Wheeler published his report on the site in 1954.\nIn 1949, Wheeler was appointed Honorary Secretary of the British Academy after Frederic G. Kenyon stepped down from the position. According to Piggott, the institution had \"unhappily drifted into senility without the excuse of being venerable\", and Wheeler devoted much time attempting to revitalise the organisation and ensured that Charles Webster was appointed president. Together, Wheeler and Webster sought to increase the number of younger members of the academy, increasing the number of Fellows who were permitted to join and proposing that those over 75 years of age not be permitted to serve on the organisation's council; this latter measure was highly controversial, but, though defeated in 1951, Wheeler and Webster were able to push it through in 1952. In doing so, Piggott stated, Wheeler helped rid the society of its \"self-perpetuating gerontocracy\". To help him in these projects, Wheeler employed a personal assistant, Molly Myers, who remained with him for the rest of his life.\nPopular fame: 1952\u20131969.\nIn 1956, Wheeler retired from his part-time professorship at the Institute of Archaeology. Childe was also retiring from his position of director that year, and Wheeler involved himself in the arguments surrounding who should replace him. Wheeler vocally opposed the nomination of W.F. Grimes, deeming his career undistinguished; instead, he championed Glyn Daniel as a candidate, although ultimately Grimes was selected. That year, Wheeler's marriage broke down, and he moved from his wife's house to a former brothel at 27 Whitcomb Street in central London. From 1954 to 1959, he served as the President of the Society of Antiquaries, and after resigning supported Ian Richmond as his replacement; however, Joan Evans was selected. From 1964 to 1966 he served as Chairman of the Ancient Monuments Board, stepping down when he concluded that he was too old for the role.\nIn December 1963, Wheeler underwent a prostate operation that went wrong, and was hospitalised for over a month.\nIn November 1967, Wheeler became a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH), and in 1968 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).\nMedia fame and public archaeology.\nWheeler became famous in Britain as \"the embodiment of popular archaeology through the medium of television\". In 1952, Wheeler was invited to be a panelist on the new BBC television series \"Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?\". Based on the American quiz programme \"What in the World?\", the show was hosted by Glyn Daniel and featured three experts in archaeology, anthropology, and natural history being asked to identify artefacts that had been selected from various museums. Wheeler is alleged to have prepared for the show by checking beforehand which objects had been temporarily removed from display. The show proved popular with British audiences, and would air for six more years. It brought Wheeler to public attention, resulting in a Television Personality of the Year award for him in 1954. He also appeared in an episode of \"Buried Treasure\", an archaeology show also hosted by Daniel, in which the pair travelled to Denmark to discuss Tollund Man. In 1957, he appeared in a second episode of \"Buried Treasure\", for which he travelled to Pakistan to discuss that nation's archaeology, and in 1958 again appeared in an episode, this time on the site of Great Zimbabwe in Southern Rhodesia. In 1959 he presented his own three-part series on \"The Grandeur That Was Rome\", for which he travelled to Hadrian's Wall, Pompeii, and Leptis Magna; the show failed to secure high ratings, and was Wheeler's last major foray into television. Meanwhile, he also made appearances on BBC radio, initially featuring on the John Irving series \"The Archaeologist\", but later presenting his own eight-part series on Roman Britain and also appearing on the series \"Asian Club\", which was aimed primarily at newly arrived migrants from the Indian subcontinent.\nFrom 1954 onward, Wheeler began to devote an increasing amount of his time to encouraging greater public interest in archaeology, and it was in that year that he obtained an agent. Oxford University Press also published two of his books in 1954. The first was a book on archaeological methodologies, \"Archaeology from the Earth\", which was translated into various languages. The second was \"Rome Beyond the Imperial Frontier\", discussing evidence for Roman activity at sites such as Arikamedu and Segontium. In 1955 Wheeler released his episodic autobiography, \"Still Digging\", which had sold over 70,000 copies by the end of the year. In 1959, Wheeler wrote \"Early India and Pakistan\", which was published as part as Daniel's \"Ancient Peoples and Places\" series for Thames and Hudson; as with many earlier books, he was criticised for rushing to conclusions.\nHe wrote the section entitled \"Ancient India\" for Piggott's edited volume \"The Dawn of Civilisation\", which was published by Thames and Hudson in 1961, before writing an introduction for Roger Wood's photography book \"Roman Africa in Colour\", which was also published by Thames and Hudson. He then agreed to edit a series for the publisher, known as \"New Aspects of Antiquity\", through which they released a variety of archaeological works. The rival publisher Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson had also persuaded Wheeler to work for them, securing him to write many sections of their book \"Splendours of the East\". They also published his 1968 book \"Flames Over Persepolis\", in which Wheeler discussed Persepolis and the Persian Empire in the year that it was conquered by Alexander the Great.\nIn 1954, the tour company R.K. Swan invited Wheeler to provide lectures on the archaeology of ancient Greece aboard their Hellenic cruise line, which he did in 1955. In 1957, he then gave a guided tour of the archaeology of the Indian subcontinent for the rival tour company Fairways and Swinford. After Swans appointed him to the position of chairman of their Hellenic Cruise division, he made two fortnight tours a year, in spring and summer. In late 1969 he conducted the Swans tour to the Indian subcontinent, visiting the south and east of the republic as well as Ceylon. During this period, Wheeler had kept in contact with many of his friends and colleagues in India and Pakistan, helping to secure them work and funding where possible.\nWheeler had continued his archaeological investigations, and in 1954 led an expedition to the Somme and Pas de Calais where he sought to obtain more information on the French Iron Age to supplement that gathered in the late 1930s. Pakistan's Ministry of Education invited Wheeler to return to their country in October 1956. Here, he undertook test excavations at Charsada to determine a chronology of the site. In 1965, he agreed to take on the position of President of the Camelot Research Committee, which had been established to promote the findings of excavations at Cadbury Castle in Somerset run by his friends Ralegh Radford and Alcock; the project ended in 1970. He also agreed to sit as Chairman of the Archaeological Committee overseeing excavations at York Minster, work which occupied him into the 1970s. Wheeler had also continued his work with museums, campaigning for greater state funding for them. While he had become a trustee of the institution in 1963, he achieved publicity for vocally criticising the British Museum as \"a mountainous corpse\", lambasting it as being poorly managed and overcrowded with artefacts. The BBC staged a public debate with the museum director Frank Francis.\nBritish Academy and UNESCO.\nAs Honorary Secretary of the British Academy, Wheeler focused on increasing the organisation's revenues, thus enabling it to expand its remit. He developed personal relationships with various employees at the British Treasury, and offered the academy's services as an intermediary in dealing with the Egypt Exploration Society, the British School at Athens, the British School at Rome, the British School at Ankara, the British School in Iraq, and the British School at Jerusalem, all of which were then directly funded independently by the Treasury. Accepting this offer, the Treasury agreed to double its funding of the academy to \u00a35,000 a year. Approaching various charitable foundations, from 1955 Wheeler also secured funding from both the Pilgrim Trust and the Nuffield Foundation, and in 1957 then secured additional funding from the Rockefeller Foundation.\nWith this additional money, the academy was able to organise a survey of the state of the humanities and social sciences in the United Kingdom, authoring a report that was published by Oxford University Press in 1961 as \"Research in the Humanities and the Social Sciences\". On the basis of this report, Wheeler was able to secure a dramatic rise in funding from the British Treasury; they increased their annual grant to \u00a325,000, and promised that this would increase to \u00a350,000 shortly after. According to his later biographer Jacquetta Hawkes, in doing so Wheeler raised the position of the academy to that of \"the main source of official patronage for the humanities\" within the United Kingdom, while Piggott stated that he set the organisation upon its \"modern course\".\nTo improve Britain's cultural influence abroad, Wheeler had been urging the establishment of a British Institute of History and Archaeology in East Africa, touring East Africa itself in August 1955. In 1956, the academy requested \u00a36,000 from the Treasury to fund this new institution, to which they eventually agreed in 1959. The institute was initially established in Dar es Salaam in 1961, although later relocated to Nairobi. Meanwhile, Wheeler had also been campaigning for the establishment of a British Institute of Persian Studies, a project which was supported by the British Embassy in Tehran; they hoped that it would rival the successful French Institute in the city. In 1960, the Treasury agreed, with the new institution being housed on the premises of the University of Tehran. He further campaigned for the establishment of a British Institute in Japan, although these ideas were scrapped amid the British financial crisis of 1967.\nWheeler retained an active interest in the running of these British institutions abroad; in 1967 he visited the British School in Jerusalem amid the Six-Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbours, and in January 1968 visited the Persian institute with the archaeologist Max Mallowan and Mallowan's wife Agatha Christie, there inspecting the excavations at Siraf. In 1969 he proceeded to the Italian city of Rome to inspect the British School there. That year, he resigned as Honorary Secretary of the academy. The position became a salaried, professional one, with the numismatist Derek Allen taking on the position.\nRecognising his stature within the archaeological establishment, the government appointed Wheeler as the British representative on a UNESCO project to undertake a programme of rescue archaeology in the Nile Valley ahead of the construction of the Aswan Dam, which was going to flood large areas of Egypt and Sudan. Personally securing UK funding for the project, he deemed it an issue of national and personal shame when he was unable to persuade the British government to supply additional funding for the relocation of the Abu Simbel temples. In October 1968, he took part in a UNESCO visit to Pakistan to assess the state of Mohenjo-daro, writing the project's report on how the archaeological site could best be preserved. His involvement with UNESCO continued for the rest of his life, and in March 1973 he was invited to the organisation's conference in Paris.\nFinal years: 1970\u20131976.\nDuring his final years, Wheeler remained involved in various activities, for instance sitting on the advisory panel of the \"Antiquity\" journal and the Management Committee of the Royal Archaeological Institute. In March 1971, the archaeologist Barry Cunliffe and a number of his undergraduate students at the University of Southampton organised a conference on the subject of \"The Iron Age and its Hillforts\" to celebrate Wheeler's eightieth birthday. Wheeler attended the event, whose conference proceedings were published as a festschrift for the octogenarian. In spring 1973, Wheeler returned to BBC television for two episodes of the archaeology-themed series \"Chronicle\" in which he discussed his life and career. The episodes were well received, and Wheeler became a close friend of the show's producer, David Collison. 1974 saw Wheeler appear in a series of six BBC TV interviews with presenter and broadcaster Magnus Magnusson called \"Sir Mortimer and Magnus\" during which he talked anecdotally about his life and work.\nIn the 1970s, Wheeler became increasingly forgetful and came to rely largely on his assistant, Molly Myres, to organise his affairs. Amid increasing ill health, in September 1973 he moved full-time into Myres's house in Leatherhead, Surrey, although he continued to use his central London flat during day-trips to the city. There, he wrote a final book, \"My Archaeological Mission to India and Pakistan\", although much of the text was culled from his previous publications; it was published by Thames and Hudson in 1976. Following a stroke, Wheeler died at Myers' home on 22 July 1976. In memoriam, the British Academy, Royal Academy, and Royal Society flew their flags at half-mast. Wheeler's funeral was held with full military honours at a local crematorium, while a larger memorial service was held in St James's Church, Piccadilly in November.\nPersonal life.\nWheeler was known as \"Rik\" among friends. He divided opinion among those who knew him, with some loving and others despising him, and during his lifetime, he was often criticised on both scholarly and moral grounds.\nArchaeologist Sir Max Mallowan asserted that he \"was a delightful, light-hearted and amusing companion, but those close to him knew that he could be a dangerous opponent if threatened with frustration\".\nHis charm offensives were often condemned as being insincere.\nDuring excavations, he was known as an authoritarian leader but favoured those who he thought exhibited bravery by standing up to his authority. Hence, he has been termed \"a benevolent dictator\". He was meticulous in his writings, and would repeatedly revise and rewrite both pieces for publication and personal letters. Throughout his life, he was a heavy smoker.\nWheeler expressed the view that he was \"the least political of mortals\". Despite not taking a strong interest in politics, Wheeler was described by his biographer as \"a natural conservative\"; for instance, during his youth he was strongly critical of the Suffragettes and their cause of greater legal rights for women.\nNevertheless, he was \"usually happy to advance young women professionally\", something that may have been based largely on his sexual attraction toward them. He expressed little interest in his relatives; in later life, he saw no reason to have a social relationship with people purely on the basis of family ties.\nWheeler was married three times. In May 1914, Wheeler married Tessa Verney. Tessa became an accomplished archaeologist, and they collaborated until her death in 1936. Their only child, Michael Mortimer Wheeler, was born in January 1915; he became a barrister. Following Tessa's death, in 1939, Wheeler married Mavis de Vere Cole, widow of prankster Horace de Vere Cole. Their relationship was strained; Cole's diaries revealed that Wheeler hit her when she annoyed him, which he was later shocked at having done.\nIn 1945, Mortimer Wheeler married his third wife, Margaret Collingridge. Although they became estranged in 1956, Collingridge's Catholicism prevented divorce. Meanwhile, Wheeler was well known for his conspicuous promiscuity, favouring young women for one-night stands, many of whom were his students. He was further known for having casual sex in public places. That behaviour led to much emotional suffering among his various wives and mistresses of which he was aware.\nReception and legacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"He was a true innovator in archaeology, an inspired teacher, [and] had the dramatic gifts to enable him to spread his own enthusiasm among multitudes. He developed powers of command and creative administration that brought him extraordinary successes in energising feeble institutions and creating new ones.\"\n\u2014 Jacquetta Hawkes, 1982.\nWheeler has been termed \"the most famous British archaeologist of the twentieth century\" by archaeologists Gabriel Moshenska and Tim Schadla-Hall. Highlighting his key role in encouraging interest in archaeology throughout British society, they stated that his \"mastery of public archaeology was founded on his keen eye for value and a showman's willingness to package\nand sell the past\". This was an issue about which Wheeler felt very strongly; writing his obituary for the \"Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society\", the English archaeologist Stuart Piggott noted that Wheeler placed \"great importance to the archaeologist's obligation to the public, on whose support the prosecution of his subject ultimately depended.\"\nPiggott believed that Wheeler's greatest impact was as \"the great innovator in field techniques\", comparing him in this respect to Pitt-Rivers. Piggott stated that the \"importance of Wheeler's contribution to archaeological technique, enormous and far-reaching, lies in the fact that in the early 1920s he not only appreciated and understood what Pitt-Rivers had done, but saw that his work could be used as a basis for adaptation, development and improvement.\" L. C. Carr stated that it was for his methodological developments, oft termed \"the Wheeler Method\", that Wheeler was best known; in this she contrasted him with those archaeologists who were best known for their associations with a specific archaeological site, such as Arthur Evans and Knossos or Leonard Woolley and Ur.\nWheeler was well known for his publications on archaeological matters; Carr stated that both Wheeler and his first wife emphasised \"technical rigour and a full presentation of materials unearthed, as well as a literary discussion of their meaning calculated to appeal to a larger audience.\" Focusing on Wheeler's publications regarding South Asian archaeology, Sudeshna Guha noted that he \"produced an assemblage of image-objects that embodied the precision he demanded from excavation photography.\"\nMallowan noted that \"Immediate and swift presentation of results was more important to him than profound scholarship, although his critical sense made him conscious that it was necessary to maintain high standards and he would approve of nothing that was slipshod.\" Jacquetta Hawkes commented that he made errors in his interpretation of the archaeological evidence because he was \"sometimes too sure of being right, too ready to accept his own authority\". She asserted that while Wheeler was not an original thinker, he had \"a vision of human history that enabled him to see each discovery of its traces, however small, in its widest significance.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Despite his very short stay as Director General, [Wheeler] infused an element of urgency into the Indian archaeological scene. With him archaeology in India became exciting, worth doing for its own sake. This excitement is apparent in the articles that he wrote, and still affects those who know the scene.\"\n\u2014 Dilip K. Chakrabarti, 1982 \nPiggott claimed that Wheeler's appointment as Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India represented \"the most remarkable archaeological achievement of his career, an enormous challenge accepted and surmounted in the autocratic and authoritarian terms within which he could best deploy his powers as administrator and excavator. No other archaeologist of the time, it seems fair to remark, could have come near to attaining his command of incisive strategy and often ruthless tactics which won him the bewildered admiration and touching devotion of his Indian staff.\" The Indian archaeologist Dilip K. Chakrabarti later stated that Wheeler's accomplishments while in India were \"considerable\", particularly given the socio-political turmoil of independence and partition. Chakrabarti stated that Wheeler had contributed to South Asian archaeology in various ways: by establishing a \"total view\" of the region's development from the Palaeolithic onward, by introducing new archaeological techniques and methodologies to the subcontinent, and by encouraging Indian universities to begin archaeological research. Ultimately, Chakrabarti was of the opinion that Wheeler had \"prepared the archaeology of the subcontinent for its transition to modernity in the post-Partition period.\" Similarly, Peter Johansen praised Wheeler for systematising and professionalising Indian archaeology and for \"instituting a clearly defined body of techniques and methods for field and laboratory work and training.\"\nOn Wheeler's death, H.\u00a0D. Sankalia of Deccan College, Pune, described him as \"well known among Old World archaeologists in the United States\", particularly for his book \"Archaeology from the Earth\" and his studies of the Indus Valley Civilisation. In its 2013 obituary of the English archaeologist Mick Aston, \"British Archaeology\" magazine \u2013 the publication of the Council for British Archaeology \u2013 described Aston as \"the Mortimer Wheeler of our times\" because despite the strong differences between their personalities, both had done much to bring archaeology to the British public. However, writing in 2011, Moshenska and Schadla-Hall asserted that Wheeler's reputation has not undergone significant revision among archaeologists, but that instead he had come to be remembered as \"a cartoonish and slightly eccentric figure\" whom they termed \"Naughty Morty\".\nCarr described the Institute of Archaeology as \"one of the [Wheeler] couple's most permanent memorials.\"\nMortimer Wheeler Archaeological Lectures.\nOn the proposal of Council of the British Academy, a lecture series was established to commemorate Sir Mortimer Wheeler's 80th birthday. The lectures were given annually from 1971 to 1991 and then discontinued as a series of single lectures. In 1992 and again in 2001, Wheeler Lectures were keynote presentations in British Academy archaeological conferences.\nBiographies and studies.\nIn 1960, Ronald William Clark published a biography titled \"Sir Mortimer Wheeler\". FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan, reviewed the volume for the journal \"Man\", describing \"this very readable little book\" as being \"adulatory\" in tone, \"but hardly more so than its subject deserves.\" In 1982, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes published a second biography, \"Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology\". Hawkes admitted she had developed \"a very great liking\" for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had \"a daemonic energy\", with his accomplishments in India being \"almost superhuman\". Ultimately, she thought of him as being \"an epic hero in an anti-heroic age\" in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.\nIn the 2000 film \"Hey Ram\", the lead character, Saket Ram (played by Kamal Haasan) and his friend, Amjad Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan) are shown as employees of Wheeler, who was portrayed by Lewis K. Elbinger, before the 1947 Hindu\u2013Muslim riots. In a 2003 volume of the \"South Asian Studies\" journal, Sudeshna Gusha published a research article examining Wheeler's use of photography in his excavations and publications in the Indian subcontinent.\nIn 2011, the academic journal \"Public Archaeology\" published a research paper by Moshenska and Schadla-Hall that analysed Wheeler's role in presenting archaeology to the British public. Two years later, the \"Papers from the Institute of Archaeology\" issued a short comic strip by Moshenska and Alex Salamunovich depicting Wheeler's activities in studying the archaeology of Libya during World War II.\nBibliography.\nA bibliography of Wheeler's published books was included by Piggott in his obituary, and again by Hawkes in her biography.\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50695", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50695", "title": "Augustus Pitt Rivers", "text": "English army officer, ethnologist and archaeologist\nLieutenant General Augustus Henry Lane Fox Pitt Rivers (14 April 1827\u00a0\u2013 4 May 1900) was an English officer in the British Army, ethnologist, and archaeologist. He was noted for innovations in archaeological methodology, and in the museum display of archaeological and ethnological collections. His international collection of about 22,000 objects was the founding collection of the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford, while his collection of English archaeology from the area around Stonehenge forms the basis of the collection at The Salisbury Museum in Wiltshire.\nThroughout most of his life he used the surname Lane Fox, under which his early archaeological reports are published. In 1880 he adopted the Pitt Rivers name on inheriting from Lord Rivers (a cousin) an estate of more than 32,000 acres in Cranborne Chase.\nHis family name is often spelled as \"Pitt-Rivers\". His middle name is sometimes spelled as \"Lane-Fox\".\nEarly life and family.\nBorn Augustus Henry Lane-Fox at Bramham cum Oglethorpe near Wetherby in Yorkshire, he was the son of William Lane-Fox and Lady Caroline Douglas, sister of George Douglas, 17th Earl of Morton. The politicians George Lane-Fox and Sackville Lane-Fox were his uncles.\nIn 1880, Lane Fox inherited the estates of his cousin, Horace Pitt-Rivers, 6th Baron Rivers and with it the remainder of the Richard Rigby fortune. It was \"an event that transformed his life\". He was required to adopt the surname Pitt-Rivers as part of the bequest 'either alone or in addition to his or their surname'. On 3 February 1853, Pitt-Rivers (still under the surname Fox) married The Honourable Alice Margaret Stanley (1828\u20131910), daughter of the politician Edward Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley and of the women's education campaigner Henrietta Stanley, Baroness Stanley of Alderley. Alice had a slew of siblings active in the public issues of the day, several of whom married into prominent families. The Pitt Rivers Museum suggests that some of the founding collection, particularly some Indian items, may have come from John Constantine Stanley (1837\u20131878), younger brother of Alice.\nDescendants.\nAugustus and Alice had nine children who reached adulthood; they were born between 1855 and 1866. As they were all born before Augustus took the new surname in 1880, their births are registered under the name of Fox (or Lane-Fox).\nAugustus' descendants include his grandson, anthropologist, eugenicist, and anti-Semite George Pitt-Rivers, who was interned in 1940 under Defence Regulation 18B. George's children included Michael Pitt-Rivers, and his brother, anthropologist and ethnographer Julian A. Pitt-Rivers. A further generation includes Augustus's great-great-grandson, equestrian William Fox-Pitt.\nMilitary career.\nLane Fox had a long and successful military career as a staff officer. He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, for six months at the age of fourteen and was commissioned into the Grenadier Guards on 16 May 1845 as an ensign. In the course of a thirty-two-year military career, albeit much interrupted by leave, he only once saw major front line action, at the Battle of Alma in 1854. Soon after the battle, he was found unfit for active service and returned to England. In 1851 he became a member of the committee to experiment and report on the respective merits of the army's smoothbore muskets. He was appointed to Woolwich to instruct in the use of the new Mini\u00e9 rifle in 1852. Subsequently, he was largely responsible for founding the Hythe school of Musketry in Kent and became its principal instructor, revising its \"Instruction of Musketry\" manual. The remainder of his service career revolved around musketry instruction and in 1858 he published a paper \"On the improvement of the rifle as a weapon for general use\". He bought a promotion to captain on 2 August 1850. He was promoted to the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel of the army \"for distinguished Service in the Field\" during the Crimean War. On 15 May 1857, he bought the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Grenadier Guards. The then brevet-major Lane Fox was appointed a member of the Fifth Class of the Order of the Medjidie in 1858 for \"distinguished services before the enemy during the [Crimean War]\". He was promoted to colonel on 22 January 1867 and major-general in 1877. Pitt Rivers retired in 1882 and was accorded the honorary rank of lieutenant-general.\nArchaeological career.\nPitt Rivers' interests in archaeology and ethnology began in the 1850s, during postings overseas, and he became a noted scientist while he was a serving military officer. His interest began with the evolution of the rifle, which extended to other weapons and tools, and he became a collector of artefacts illustrating the development of human invention. His collection became famous, and, after being exhibited in 1874\u20131875 at the Bethnal Green Museum, London, was presented in 1885 to the University of Oxford. He was elected, in the space of five years, to the Ethnological Society of London (1861), the Society of Antiquaries of London (1864) and the Anthropological Society of London (1865).\nIn 1867, Pitt Rivers left full-time military service and went on half pay. The same year, he visited an archaeological excavation being carried out in the Yorkshire Wolds by Canon William Greenwell, librarian of Durham Cathedral and an established archaeologist, to whom he may have been introduced by mutual friends George Rolleston or Albert Way. Pitt Rivers received his first instruction in excavation from Greenwell, and later described himself as Greenwell's pupil. Greenwell viewed archaeology as a serious scholarly process of assembling evidence on periods which lacked written records, contrasted to the \"ignorant and greedy spirit of mere curiosity-hunting\"; views that would influence Pitt Rivers' own approach.\nBy the time he retired, he had amassed ethnographic collections numbering tens of thousands of items from all over the world. Influenced by the evolutionary writings of Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer, he arranged them typologically and (within types) chronologically. He viewed archaeology as an extension of anthropology and, as consequence, built up matching collections of archaeological and ethnographic objects to show longer developmental sequences to support his views on cultural evolution. This style of arrangement, designed to highlight evolutionary trends in human artefacts, was a revolutionary innovation in museum design.\nPitt Rivers' ethnological collections form the basis of the Pitt Rivers Museum which is still one of Oxford's attractions. His researches and collections cover periods from the Lower Paleolithic to Roman and medieval times, and extend all over the world. The Pitt Rivers Museum curates more than half a million ethnographic and archaeological artefacts, photographic and manuscript collections from all parts of the world. The museum was founded in 1884 when the university accepted the gift of more than 20,000 artefacts from Pitt Rivers. The university awarded him the Doctorate of Civil Law in 1886, and he was later named a Fellow of the Royal Society. The collections continue to grow, and the museum has been described as one of the \"six great ethnological museums of the world\".\nPitt Rivers' Wessex Collection is housed in The Salisbury Museum, not far from Stonehenge. The Wessex Gallery of archaeology opened in 2014, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and other sources. Pitt Rivers and other early archaeologists such as William Stukeley who first investigated the prehistory of Wiltshire, Cranborne Chase, Avebury and Stonehenge, are celebrated in the gallery.\nThe estates Pitt Rivers inherited in 1880 contained a wealth of archaeological material from the Roman and Saxon periods. He excavated these over seventeen seasons, from the mid-1880s until his death. His approach was highly methodical by the standards of the time, and he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist to work in Britain. His most important methodological innovation was his insistence that \"all\" artefacts, not just beautiful or unique ones, be collected and catalogued. This focus on everyday objects as the key to understanding the past broke decisively with earlier archaeological practice, which verged on treasure hunting. It is Pitt Rivers' most important, and most lasting, scientific legacy. His work inspired Mortimer Wheeler, among others, to add to the scientific approach of archaeological excavation techniques.\nFollowing the passage of the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882, Pitt Rivers became the first Inspector of Ancient Monuments: a post created by anthropologist and parliamentarian John Lubbock who married Pitt Rivers' daughter, Alice.

It encompasses broad scientific topics like chemistry, biology, ecology, geology, hydraulics, hydrology, microbiology, and mathematics to create solutions that will protect and also improve the health of living organisms and improve the quality of the environment. Environmental engineering is a sub-discipline of civil engineering and chemical engineering. While on the part of civil engineering, the Environmental Engineering is focused mainly on Sanitary Engineering.\nEnvironmental engineering applies scientific and engineering principles to improve and maintain the environment to protect human health, protect nature's beneficial ecosystems, and improve environmental-related enhancement of the quality of human life.\nEnvironmental engineers devise solutions for wastewater management, water and air pollution control, recycling, waste disposal, and public health. They design municipal water supply and industrial wastewater treatment systems, and design plans to prevent waterborne diseases and improve sanitation in urban, rural and recreational areas. They evaluate hazardous-waste management systems to evaluate the severity of such hazards, advise on treatment and containment, and develop regulations to prevent mishaps. They implement environmental engineering law, as in assessing the environmental impact of proposed construction projects.\nEnvironmental engineers study the effect of technological advances on the environment, addressing local and worldwide environmental issues such as acid rain, global warming, ozone depletion, water pollution and air pollution from automobile exhausts and industrial sources.\nMost jurisdictions impose licensing and registration requirements for qualified environmental engineers.\nEtymology.\nThe word environmental has its root in the late 19th-century French word \"environ (verb), meaning to encircle or to encompass.\" The word environment was used by Carlyle in 1827 to refer to the aggregate of conditions in which a person or thing lives. The meaning shifted again in 1956 when it was used in the ecological sense, where Ecology is the branch of science dealing with the relationship of living things to their environment.\nThe second part of the phrase environmental engineer originates from Latin roots and was used in the 14th century French as engignour, meaning a constructor of military engines such as trebuchets, harquebuses, longbows, cannons, catapults, ballistas, stirrups, armour as well as other deadly or bellicose contraptions. The word engineer was not used to reference public works until the 16th century; and it likely entered the popular vernacular as meaning a contriver of public works during John Smeaton's time.\nHistory.\nAncient civilizations.\nEnvironmental engineering is a name for work that has been done since early civilizations, as people learned to modify and control the environmental conditions to meet needs. As people recognized that their health was related to the quality of their environment, they built systems to improve it. The ancient Indus Valley Civilization (3300 B.C.E. to 1300 B.C.E.) had advanced control over their water resources. The public work structures found at various sites in the area include wells, public baths, water storage tanks, a drinking water system, and a city-wide sewage collection system. They also had an early canal irrigation system enabling large-scale agriculture.\nFrom 4000 to 2000 B.C.E., many civilizations had drainage systems and some had sanitation facilities, including the Mesopotamian Empire, Mohenjo-Daro, Egypt, Crete, and the Orkney Islands in Scotland. The Greeks also had aqueducts and sewer systems that used rain and wastewater to irrigate and fertilize fields.\nThe first aqueduct in Rome was constructed in 312 B.C.E., and the Romans continued to construct aqueducts for irrigation and safe urban water supply during droughts. They also built an underground sewer system as early as the 7th century B.C.E. that fed into the Tiber River, draining marshes to create farmland as well as removing sewage from the city.\nModern era.\nVery little change was seen from the decline of the Roman Empire until the 19th century, where improvements saw increasing efforts focused on public health. Modern environmental engineering began in London in the mid-19th century when Joseph Bazalgette designed the first major sewerage system following the Great Stink. The city's sewer system conveyed raw sewage to the River Thames, which also supplied the majority of the city's drinking water, leading to an outbreak of cholera. The introduction of drinking water treatment and sewage treatment in industrialized countries reduced waterborne diseases from leading causes of death to rarities.\nThe field emerged as a separate academic discipline during the middle of the 20th century in response to widespread public concern about water and air pollution and other environmental degradation. As society and technology grew more complex, they increasingly produced unintended effects on the natural environment. One example is the widespread application of the pesticide DDT to control agricultural pests in the years following World War II. The story of DDT as vividly told in Rachel Carson's \"Silent Spring\" (1962) is considered to be the birth of the modern environmental movement, which led to the modern field of \"environmental engineering.\"\nEducation.\nMany universities offer environmental engineering programs through either the department of civil engineering or chemical engineering and also including electronic projects to develop and balance the environmental\nconditions. Environmental engineers in a civil engineering program often focus on hydrology, water resources management, bioremediation, and water and wastewater treatment plant design. Environmental engineers in a chemical engineering program tend to focus on environmental chemistry, advanced air and water treatment technologies, and separation processes. Some subdivisions of environmental engineering include natural resources engineering and agricultural engineering.\nCourses for students fall into a few broad classes:\nCurriculum.\nThe following topics make up a typical curriculum in environmental engineering:\nApplications.\nWater supply and treatment.\nEnvironmental engineers evaluate the water balance within a watershed and determine the available water supply, the water needed for various needs in that watershed, the seasonal cycles of water movement through the watershed and they develop systems to store, treat, and convey water for various uses.\nWater is treated to achieve water quality objectives for the end uses. In the case of a potable water supply, water is treated to minimize the risk of infectious disease transmission, the risk of non-infectious illness, and to create a palatable water flavor. Water distribution systems are designed and built to provide adequate water pressure and flow rates to meet various end-user needs such as domestic use, fire suppression, and irrigation.\nWastewater treatment.\nThere are numerous wastewater treatment technologies. A wastewater treatment train can consist of a primary clarifier system to remove solid and floating materials, a secondary treatment system consisting of an aeration basin followed by flocculation and sedimentation or an activated sludge system and a secondary clarifier, a tertiary biological nitrogen removal system, and a final disinfection process. The aeration basin/activated sludge system removes organic material by growing bacteria (activated sludge). The secondary clarifier removes the activated sludge from the water. The tertiary system, although not always included due to costs, is becoming more prevalent to remove nitrogen and phosphorus and to disinfect the water before discharge to a surface water stream or ocean outfall.\nAir pollution management.\nScientists have developed air pollution dispersion models to evaluate the concentration of a pollutant at a receptor or the impact on overall air quality from vehicle exhausts and industrial flue gas stack emissions. To some extent, this field overlaps the desire to decrease carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from combustion processes.\nEnvironmental impact assessment and mitigation.\nEnvironmental engineers apply scientific and engineering principles to evaluate if there are likely to be any adverse impacts to water quality, air quality, habitat quality, flora and fauna, agricultural capacity, traffic, ecology, and noise. If impacts are expected, they then develop mitigation measures to limit or prevent such impacts. An example of a mitigation measure would be the creation of wetlands in a nearby location to mitigate the filling in of wetlands necessary for a road development if it is not possible to reroute the road.\nIn the United States, the practice of environmental assessment was formally initiated on January 1, 1970, the effective date of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Since that time, more than 100 developing and developed nations either have planned specific analogous laws or have adopted procedure used elsewhere. NEPA is applicable to all federal agencies in the United States.\nRegulatory agencies.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is one of the many agencies that work with environmental engineers to solve critical issues. An essential component of EPA's mission is to protect and improve air, water, and overall environmental quality to avoid or mitigate the consequences of harmful effects.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50705", "revid": "44721228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50705", "title": "Construction engineering", "text": "Subdiscipline of civil engineering focused on construction and operations\nConstruction engineering, also known as construction operations, is a professional subdiscipline of civil engineering that deals with the designing, planning, construction, and operations management of infrastructure such as roadways, tunnels, bridges, airports, railroads, facilities, buildings, dams, utilities and other projects. Construction engineers learn some of the design aspects similar to civil engineers as well as project management aspects.\nAt the educational level, civil engineering students concentrate primarily on the design work which is more analytical, gearing them toward a career as a design professional. This essentially requires them to take a multitude of challenging engineering science and design courses as part of obtaining a 4-year accredited degree. Education for construction engineers is primarily focused on construction procedures, methods, costs, schedules and personnel management. Their primary concern is to deliver a project on time within budget and of the desired quality.\nRegarding educational requirements, construction engineering students take basic design courses in civil engineering, as well as construction management courses.\nWork activities.\nBeing a sub-discipline of civil engineering, construction engineers apply their knowledge and business, technical and management skills obtained from their undergraduate degree to oversee projects that include bridges, buildings and housing projects. Construction engineers are heavily involved in the design and management/ allocation of funds in these projects. They are charged with risk analysis, costing and planning. A career in design work does require a professional engineer license (PE). Individuals who pursue this career path are strongly advised to sit for the Engineer in Training exam (EIT), also, referred to as the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam (FE) while in college as it takes five years' (4 years in USA) post-graduate to obtain the PE license. Some states have recently changed the PE license exam pre-requisite of 4 years work experience after graduation to become a licensed Professional Engineer where an EIT is eligible to take the PE Exam in as little as 6 months after taking the FE exam.\nEntry-level construction engineers position is typically project engineers or assistant project engineers. They are responsible for preparing purchasing requisitions, processing change orders, preparing monthly budgeting reports and handling meeting minutes. The construction management position does not necessarily require a PE license; however, possessing one does make the individual more marketable, as the PE license allows the individual to sign off on temporary structure designs.\nAbilities.\nConstruction engineers are problem solvers. They contribute to the creation of infrastructure that best meets the unique demands of its environment. They must be able to understand infrastructure life cycles. When compared and contrasted to design engineers, construction engineers bring to the table their own unique perspectives for solving technical challenges with clarity and imagination. While individuals considering this career path should certainly have a strong understanding of mathematics and science, many other skills are also highly desirable, including critical and analytical thinking, time management, people management and good communication skills.\nEducational requirements.\nIndividuals looking to obtain a construction engineering degree must first ensure that the program is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). ABET accreditation is assurance that a college or university program meets the quality standards established by the profession for which it prepares its students. In the US there are currently twenty-five programs that exist in the entire country so careful college consideration is advised.\nA typical construction engineering curriculum is a mixture of engineering mechanics, engineering design, construction management and general science and mathematics. This usually leads to a Bachelor of Science degree. The B.S. degree along with some design or construction experience is sufficient for most entry-level positions. Graduate schools may be an option for those who want to go further in depth of the construction and engineering subjects taught at the undergraduate level. In most cases construction engineering graduates look to either civil engineering, engineering management or business administration as a possible graduate degree.\nJob prospects.\nJob prospects for construction engineers generally have a strong cyclical variation. For example, starting in 2008 and continuing until at least 2011, job prospects have been poor due to the collapse of housing bubbles in many parts of the world. This sharply reduced demand for construction, forced construction professionals towards infrastructure construction and therefore increased the competition faced by established and new construction engineers. This increased competition and a core reduction in quantity demand is in parallel with a possible shift in the demand for construction engineers due to the automation of many engineering tasks, overall resulting in reduced prospects for construction engineers. In early 2010, the United States construction industry had a 27% unemployment rate, this is nearly three times higher than the 9.7% national average unemployment rate. The construction unemployment rate (including tradesmen) is comparable to the United States 1933 unemployment rate\u2014the lowest point of the Great Depression\u2014of 25%.\nRemuneration.\nThe average salary for a civil engineer in the UK depends on the sector and more specifically the level of experience of the individual. A 2010 survey of the remuneration and benefits of those occupying jobs in construction and the built environment industry showed that the average salary of a civil engineer in the UK is \u00a329,582. In the United States, as of May 2013, the average was $85,640. The average salary varies depending on experience, for example the average annual salary for a civil engineer with between 3 and 6 years' experience is \u00a323,813. For those with between 14 and 20 years' experience the average is \u00a338,214.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Created by Yoshiyuki Tomino for Sunrise (now a division of Bandai Namco Filmworks), the franchise features giant robots, or mecha, known as \"Gundam\". The franchise began with the premiere of the anime series \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" on April 7, 1979, which defined the \"real robot\" mecha anime genre by depicting giant robots (including the original titular mecha) within a militaristic setting.\nThe popularity of the series and its merchandise spawned a multimedia franchise that includes over 50 TV series, films, and original video animations (OVAs), as well as manga, novels, and video games, along with a multimillion industry of plastic model kits known as Gunpla, which accounts for 90 percent of the Japanese character plastic model market. Academics in Japan have also taken interest in the series; in 2008, the virtual Gundam Academy was planned as the first academic institution based on an animated TV series.\nAs of 2022, the Gundam franchise is fully owned by Bandai Namco Holdings through its production subsidiary Bandai Namco Filmworks and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sotsu. The \"Gundam\" franchise had grossed over $ in retail sales by 2000. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 (April\u2013June 2025), the Gundam franchise generated approximately \u00a565.4 billion (approximately US$443 million) in IP-related revenue, making it Bandai Namco's highest-earning intellectual property during that period, driven by successes across streaming, model kits, theatrical releases, and experiential tourism initiatives.\nOverview.\nConcept.\n\"Mobile Suit Gundam\" was developed by animator Yoshiyuki Tomino alongside rotating members of Sunrise using the collective pseudonym Hajime Yatate.\nThe series\u2019 early working title was \"Freedom Fighter Gunboy\", reflecting the robot-centric focus and adolescent target demographic. Conceptual elements like naming the White Base \"Freedom's Fortress\", the Core Fighter \"Freedom Wing\", and the Gunperry \"Freedom Cruiser\" underscored the theme of freedom. The name \"Gundam\" was eventually chosen\u2014combining \u201cgun\u201d and \u201cdam\u201d\u2014to evoke imagery of a powerful weapon acting like a dam to hold back enemies.\nGundams are portrayed as prototype or limited-production mobile suits with superior performance compared to mass-produced models. These suits typically feature humanoid designs, cockpit control in the torso, and head units functioning as visual sensors. Across the franchise's numerous series and media formats, each Gundam variant reflects unique aesthetics, capabilities, and pilots.\nInnovations to the genre.\n\"Mobile Suit Gundam\" is credited with pioneering the real robot subgenre of mecha anime, distancing itself from the fantastical \u201csuper robot\u201d scene by introducing realistic mechanics, energy limitations, and equipment failures. The franchise integrates plausible science\u2014such as Lagrange points, O'Neill cylinder colonies, and helium-3 energy\u2014with speculative constructs like Minovsky physics to support its mechanics. Its sweeping narratives and political dimensions also align it with the space opera genre. A recurring theme includes genetically advanced humans known as &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Newtypes, endowed with extrasensory perceptions that enhance piloting capabilities and interpersonal empathy.\nTimelines.\nMost of the franchise's entries are set in the Universal Century (UC)\u2014the original timeline\u2014spanning from UC 0079's One Year War and beyond. Alternate universes such as the Cosmic Era (e.g., \"Gundam SEED\") and the Anno Domini era (e.g., \"Gundam 00\") present standalone narratives inspired by, but not bound to, the UC timeline.\nSpinoffs.\n\"SD Gundam\" employs a comedic style with chibi characters, debuting in the mid-1980s. Later series such as \"Gundam Build Fighters\" and \"Gundam Build Divers\" explore modern-day settings where battles between Gunpla (model kits) serve as the central narrative device.\nHistory.\n1970s: Origins and slow ascent into a cultural phenomenon (1979-1982).\nThe original \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" anime series (1979) emerged from a planning process at Nippon Sunrise (then still called Soeisha/Sunrise Studio) that sought to break from super robot formulas and stage a war drama with mechanical plausibility. Early development carried the working titles \"Freedom Fighter\" and then \"Freedom Fighter Gunboy\", with planning led by Eiji Yamaura's office and scripting assistance from Hiroyuki Hoshiyama before director Yoshiyuki Tomino and character designer Yoshikazu Yasuhiko fully joined. The production was mounted with Nagoya TV and the licensing agency Sotsu as co-producers and the toy firm Clover as main sponsor, in a Saturday early-evening slot targeting younger children, conditions that shaped early merchandising-facing elements such as \u201cthree hero machines\u201d, combining power-ups and the Core Fighter.\nMechanical designer Kunio Okawara\u2019s hardware-first approach, Yasuhiko\u2019s grounded characters, and Tomino\u2019s insistence on limited ammunition, maintenance, and mass-production reoriented the show toward what critics and industry later labeled the real robot genre: robots as military materiel embedded in logistics and politics rather than functioning as invincible superheroes. In subsequent interviews and retrospectives, creators from the period describe \"Gundam\" as the pivot that opened the door to more militarized mecha narratives and to audiences beyond grade-school viewers.\nDespite those creative aims, the television run (Nagoya TV, Saturdays 17:30\u201318:00) struggled to reach its sponsor\u2019s toy-buying demographic, and the series was shortened to 43 episodes. Internal accounts attribute the cutback chiefly to weak toy sell-through in the sponsor\u2019s product line rather than to the absence of a core fanbase. Tomino later spoke candidly about frictions with \u201cthe toy-store sponsor,\u201d underscoring the misalignment between the show's war drama ambitions and sponsor expectations.\nAfter first-run disappointment, momentum shifted rapidly in 1980 through reruns and the decision, floated by Tomino as early as a March 1980 \"Animage\" interview, to compile the TV material into theatrical features. Anticipation culminated in the highly publicized \u201cAnime New Century Declaration\u201d rally at Shinjuku\u2019s east plaza on February 22, 1981, where an estimated 15,000 fans gathered; the event marked the visible generational handover to an older, self-organizing anime audience. The Shochiku-distributed compilation films followed in quick succession: \"'Mobile Suit Gundam\" (March 14, 1981), \"Soldiers of Sorrow\" (July 11, 1981), and\" Encounters in Space\" (March 13, 1982), each with substantial re-editing and new animation that reframed the narrative targeting an older teen/young adult audience.\" \"\nA decisive commercial turn arrived in parallel: Bandai\u2019s plastic model line (\u201cGunpla\u201d), launched in July 1980 with the 1/144 and 1/100 Gundam kits, created a new revenue pillar that matched \"Gundam\"\u2019s quasi-military aesthetic and scale-model appeal. As Gunpla boomed and a youth\u2013adult fandom consolidated around the films, the original sponsor structure that had supported super robot programming in the 1970s began to unravel: the long-time Nagoya-TV/Sunrise slot sponsor Clover exited the stage amid the industry upheavals of 1983, after which Bandai increasingly assumed lead sponsorship roles for Sunrise\u2019s mecha programming. By the close of the compilation trilogy in 1982, \"Gundam\" had thus established both a creative template (the \u201creal robot\u201d grammar balancing tactics, politics, and character psychology) and a new business template where model kits, rather than die-cast toys, underwrote long-tail popularity.\n1980s: Gunpla and SD Gundam fuel a boom (1982\u20131989).\nBandai's launch of Gunpla in July 1980 very quickly turned the franchise into a viable media mix business rather than a one-off TV show. Contemporary production notes and later corporate retrospectives record the first 1/144 RX-78-2 Gundam kit debut in mid-1980 and emphasize that the model boom helped catalyze Sunrise\u2019s decision with Shochiku to pivot into compilation features in 1981\u201382, which in turn expanded the adult fanbase that had discovered the series via reruns. By the 2010s\u20132020s, Bandai Namco would publicly credit Gunpla and SD Gundam product lines as core pillars of the Gundam business: the group\u2019s factbooks place cumulative Gunpla shipments in the billions of units.\nOn screen, the sequel cycle first deepened the Real Robot template for an older cohort with \"Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam\" (1985\u20131986), then consciously swung toward a lighter, youth-facing register in early \"Gundam ZZ\" (1986\u20131987), a tonal recalibration that later darkened as the Axis conflict came to the fore. Production staff have described \"ZZ\" as an \u201cextension\u201d born of scheduling alongside the next feature, underlining how sponsor and broadcast realities shaped story tone as much as auteur intent. The arc culminated theatrically with \"\" (1988), marketed and remembered as the definitive conclusion to the Amuro-Char rivalry for the filmgoing audience of the day.\nIn contrast, chibi parody spinoffs evolved into a full sub-brand. \"SD Gundam\" began as theatrical shorts paired with marquee releases, first in March 1988 alongside \"Char\u2019s Counterattack,\" before proliferating in OVA and video formats with toy-line tie-ins (\"SD Sengokuden\", \"Knight Gundam\") that broadened the demographic beyond \u201cmilitary sci-fi.\u201d Product-side, Bandai launched the \"BB Senshi\" model line in 1987 and sustained it for decades, evidencing how SD crystallized as a merchandising ecosystem in its own right. Outside models, Bandai's Carddass trading cards, where SD designs were prominent contributors, crossed 10 billion cards by 2012, a data point often cited as emblematic of the late-1980s SD boom's long tail.\nThe broader video market also mattered. Japan's late-1980s OVA surge, enabled by home video and premium unit pricing, created a space for higher-spec, fan-targeted projects outside weekly TV. Industry studies periodize a rapid rise in direct-to-video anime in the mid-1980s, with volume peaking around 1991, and frame OVAs as part of the media-mix economics that let anime recoup costs beyond broadcast. Sunrise and Bandai Visual moved quickly into that direction with ' (1989), the franchise's first OVA, explicitly aimed at the older audience that had coalesced around models and movies; further OVAs like ' (1991\u20131992) followed, consolidating the \u201cpremium\u201d side of the brand.\nAcross the decade, then, Gundam's expansion was a feedback loop: Gunpla revenues and a diversifying SD business underwrote more ambitious screen projects; compilation films and \"Z\" cultivated older fans; \"ZZ\" tested how far the tone could pivot back toward youth before \"Char\u2019s Counterattack\" restored a grand-finale solemnity; and the OVA boom gave Sunrise a high-spec, collector-oriented outlet that matched the maturing fan economy forged by the very model boom that began in 1980.\n1990s: Corporate consolidation, alternate universes, and growing pains (1991\u20131999).\nAt the start of the decade, the brand's center of gravity was still the SD Gundam phenomenon. Producer Masuo Ueda said at one point that SD sales were \u201cbriefly four times\u201d those of the real kits. Short films and OVAs eventually culminating in the theatrical omnibus \"Mobile Suit SD Gundam Festival\" (1993) kept chibi parodies in front of family audiences, backed by booming Carddass and BB Senshi merchandise lines. As the SD cycle wound down on screens by mid-1993, consumer tastes and TV economics were shifting. Bandai, which had launched the High Grade (1990) and then the Master Grade (1995) model lines, increasingly targeted older hobbyists to stabilize Gunpla demand through higher-spec kits, an approach that shaped the decade's production bets.\nAgainst that backdrop, \"Mobile Suit Gundam F91\" (1991) illustrates the uncertainty of the early 1990s. Planned as a new year-long Universal Century TV serial, it was compressed into a single feature with threads left for a hypothetical continuation; staff accounts and trade coverage have long read this pivot as a hedge on whether a full UC run could be sustained at that moment. Two years later, \"Victory Gundam\" (1993\u201394) returned UC to a Friday 5 p.m. slot (now on TV Asahi) under tight conditions. Contemporary and retrospective interviews describe a difficult production climate and unusually stark story tone for that hour, reflecting a franchise searching for a post-boom footing even as it served broadcast and sponsor needs.\nIn February 1994, Sunrise formally joined the Bandai Group, aligning animation with toys, models, and home video under one corporate roof. The integration catalyzed more regular output and experimentation. \"Mobile Fighter G Gundam\" (1994\u201395) was the first fully non-UC TV entry, reframing Gundam around over-the-top martial-arts duels and national pastiche. Controversial at the proposal stage, it proved a durable template for \u201calternate universe\u201d projects and broadened the franchise's tonal bandwidth.\n\"Gundam Wing\" (1995\u201396) cemented that strategic turn at home and, crucially, abroad. In the U.S., Cartoon Network\u2019s Toonami block premiered the series in March 2000 and expanded its schedule around incoming mecha anime hits; industry trades noted the programming push, while contemporaneous coverage documented uncut night-time broadcasts and a strong ratings performance that lifted Gundam\u2019s overseas profile and led to an \"\" TV event.\nThe period was not uniformly smooth. \"After War Gundam X\" (1996) launched into Friday early-evening and, amid mid-run schedule moves at key stations, was shortened to 39 episodes, an oft-cited case study in how time-slot and merchandising headwinds could whipsaw mid-90s TV anime. Later Japanese media retrospectives detail the shift to a Saturday 6:00 a.m. slot and the curtailed run.\nAlongside TV, high-spec OVAs deepened the \u201creal robot\u201d grammar that the franchise helped define. \"\" (1996\u201399) pushed ground-war tactility and small-unit drama. In parallel, model-kit strategy continued to climb the value chain: Bandai's HG (1990) and MG (1995) ranges targeted a maturing base and helped keep Gunpla culturally visible even when weekly ratings fluctuated.\nThe decade also saw video games become a second content pillar. Bandai's hardcore strategy sims \"Giren's Greed\" (Saturn, 1998) and the crossover-builder \"SD Gundam G Generation\" (PlayStation, 1998) inaugurated long-running lines, while Saturn's \"\" trilogy (1996\u201397) introduced original-timeline side stories that bled back into model and manga development.\nThe 1990s closed with \"Turn A Gundam\" (1999\u20132000), which brought Yoshiyuki Tomino back to TV with a reflective, pastoral tone and an international industrial-design sensibility (with Syd Mead among the credited mecha designers). Within Bandai/Sunrise's \u201calternate/UC\u201d cadence, \"Turn A\" functioned as a capstone statement at the century's end\u2014stylistically apart from mid-90s TV, yet seeded by the decade's experiments and by the corporate ability, post-1994, to greenlight distinct production bets within one brand. In parallel, Sunrise and Bandai mounted a 20th-anniversary live action experiment, \"G-Saviour\", broadcast on TV Asahi on 29 December 2000, which was then issued in a longer \u201cFull Version\u201d on DVD (25 May 2001). A broader multimedia push framed it as an anniversary tent-pole, complete with a PlayStation 2 tie-in released ahead of broadcast and Gunpla timed to year-end shelves, but reception was tepid and the project remained a one-off, underscoring the limits of live action Gundam at the time.\n2000s: \"SEED\"-era resurgence and HD globalization (2002\u20132010).\nThe 2000s opened with a generational pivot in animation workflows and broadcast technology, and with a deliberate push to broaden Gundam's audience. \"Mobile Suit Gundam SEED\" (2002\u20132003) aired in the prime MBS/TBS Saturday 6pm slot and became a breakout TV hit that re-energized the franchise with younger viewers and a conspicuously large female cohort; contemporary coverage and later retrospectives note that character-driven plotting and the alternate universe setup eased entry for first-time viewers. Commercially it was a disc-era phenomenon: by March 2004, Bandai Visual reported \"SEED\" DVD/VHS shipments of 1.3 million, and its follow-up \"SEED DESTINY\" (2004\u20132005) passed 1.0 million disc sales by November 2005, exceptional numbers for TV anime at the time.\nIndustry-wide, cel-to-digital paint/post in the animation process accelerated around 2000, with 3DCG integration expanding through the decade; policy and industry reports periodize this shift from finishing/compositing into background/asset pipelines by the mid-2000s. Within Gundam, \"SEED\" and \"DESTINY\" leaned into digital compositing and selective 3DCG (notably ships and effects), a direction staff later said they intended to push further in feature work; by the end of the decade, \"Mobile Suit Gundam 00\" (2007\u20132009) arrived as the franchise's first native HD/widescreen TV series, with Blu-ray releases announced during broadcast.\nRunning in parallel to the TV slate, Sunrise and Bandai Visual launched Gundam's first fully 3DCG screen project with \"Mobile Suit Gundam MS IGLOO,\" initially museum-only exhibition films (2004) before OVA releases (\"Apocalypse 0079\", 2006), and the follow-on series \"MS IGLOO 2: Gravity Front\" (2008\u20132009). Sunrise's work notes and official sites emphasize the \u201cfull 3DCG\u201d approach and the use of motion capture at Sunrise D.I.D., marking IGLOO as a pipeline-proving effort that fed into later CG deployment across the brand.\nGlobally, Sunrise and Bandai also tested child-friendly, comedy-adventure positioning via \"SD Gundam Force\"\u2014a tri-party initiative with TV Tokyo and Cartoon Network. Bandai's September 2003 U.S. press release announced a Cartoon Network premiere (with Japan to follow), marking a rare case of a Gundam TV entry debuting in North America before domestic broadcast; the series subsequently aired on TV Tokyo in 2004.\nMerchandising and manufacturing also evolved. The Gunpla business expanded on the back of \"SEED/DESTINY\" demand, while Bandai centralized model-kit production at the Shizuoka Bandai Hobby Center in March 2006\u2014an investment that underpinned higher-mix, faster-turn kit rollouts for the late 2000s and beyond. Bandai Namco\u2019s annual reporting at the end of the decade describes a strategy to cultivate both youth and adult hobbyists via diversified Gunpla brands and large-scale events, a trajectory that would culminate in new lines at the decade\u2019s turn.\nVideo game production scaled up in parallel as a mainstream touchpoint. The arcade/console \"Gundam vs.\" entries became gaming fixtures; ' earned a CESA Game Awards \u201cFuture\u201d selection in 2005. Bandai Namco also launched the networked dome-cabinet arcade title ' (2006), showcased at character hobby expos and later remembered for its long service life and cockpit-immersion concept, emblematic of the company's post-merger arcade ambition. On consoles, collaborations broadened reach into action-game demographics, e.g., \"\" (\"Gundam Musou\") for the PlayStation 3 in late 2006.\nInternationally, distribution patterns diversified. Whereas \"Gundam Wing\" built a North American audience via Toonami in 2000, the late-2000s \"00\" release used Sci-Fi Channel\u2019s \u201cAni-Monday,\u201d reflecting shifts in U.S. TV anime carriage and the franchise's ability to re-enter foreign linear windows at HD quality. As the decade closed, high-spec home-video OVAs found a premium niche audience that Sunrise would fully exploit immediately thereafter with \"Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn\" (2010\u20132014), which set early Blu-ray benchmarks for original video releases and signaled durable demand for top-end Universal Century stories in the HD era.\n2010s: Platform diversification\u2014build, stream, and expand (2011\u20132021).\nAcross the 2010s, Sunrise and Bandai Namco normalized experimentation in various formats and targeting. Early in the decade, the companies partnered with Level-5 on \"Mobile Suit Gundam AGE\" (2011\u20132012), a multi-generational TV series slotted in the nationwide Sunday 17:00 block and overtly pitched to younger viewers and families; Level-5's Akihiro Hino supplied the overall story and the project was flanked by RPG/game tie-ins and magazine outreach to children's demographics (e.g., \"CoroCoro Comic\"). In commercial and reception terms, \"AGE\" did not create a new long-running kid-first TV trend, but it did sharpen the strategy tension the decade would continually revisit: how to capture new cohorts without abandoning older hobbyists.\nIn that vein, Sunrise was able to incubate a new audience through the \"Gundam Build\" subfranchise. \"Gundam Build Fighters\" (2013\u20132014) returned the brand to TV Tokyo after-school hours, explicitly linking the narrative to contemporary Gunpla culture and kitbashing, and streaming episodes online immediately after broadcast; its sequel \"Gundam Build Fighters Try\" (2014\u20132015) continued the approach with weekly free streaming and BS/BS11 carriage. The \u201cBuild\u201d line then pivoted again with \"Gundam Build Divers\" (2018), re-imagining battles around a VR-MMO conceit on the TV Tokyo network, and closed the decade by trialing a streaming-first model: \"\" (2019\u20132020) premiered on Sunrise's official YouTube \u201cGundam Channel\u201d before later TV runs, illustrating a shift toward digital-first rollouts for youth-leaning entries.\nAt the same time, the franchise expanded late-night auteur and Universal Century prestige avenues. Yoshiyuki Tomino\u2019s \"Gundam Reconguista in G\" (2014\u20132015), a 35th-anniversary original, aired in MBS/TBS\u2019s late-night \u201cAnimeism\u201d block with limited theatrical \u201cevent\u201d screenings of early episodes and parallel day-and-date streaming on d Anime Store and Bandai Channel, reflecting a broadcast/streaming hybrid strategy for adult-skew originals. UC-side, ' (2015\u20132018) established a premium \u201cevent OVA + early Blu-ray + paid streaming\u201d pipeline that would become a key revenue pattern for high-spec releases. \"Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt\" (2015\u20132017) further pushed a digital-first ONA model with paid streaming windows and later compilation films, underscoring how Sunrise used online distribution to reach core UC fans between TV cycles. Other short-form experiments, such as the fan-club-led ONA ' (2017), were explicitly structured around digital platforms (Gundam Fan Club/Gundam.info) before later theatrical compilations.\nA major tonal and scheduling shift arrived with \"\" (2015\u20132017), which returned the brand to a domestic Sunday-evening network slot on MBS/TBS with a grittier, serialized human-drama focus; it simultaneously rolled out worldwide via licensed streaming (e.g., Daisuki, Hulu, Crunchyroll), establishing a modern pattern for near-global, near-simulcast exposure.\nBy the latter half of the decade, Sunrise formalized a slate of UC follow-ups under the banner \u201cUC NexT 0100,\u201d positioning post-' works as an ongoing multi-format initiative. \"Mobile Suit Gundam Narrative\" (2018) was announced as the project's first screen entry, followed by a ' film trilogy as the second.\nDuring the 2010s, Gunpla development emphasized both technical innovation and diversification of scales. Bandai's 2010 launch of the Real Grade (RG) line introduced 1/144 kits with Master Grade-level surface detail, extensive markings, and pre-assembled inner frames. Advances in multi-color injection molding and the development of the \u201cAdvanced MS Joint\u201d frame system allowed Bandai to engineer high part density and wide articulation even at small scales, reflecting a broader industry trend toward premium realism and accessibility. Alongside RG, the decade also saw continued refinements to the Master Grade and High Grade lines, with more intricate surface detail, expanded articulation, and increasingly efficient build engineering, positioning Gunpla as both an entry-level hobby and a high-precision collector's product.\nThe decade thus broadened tie-ins beyond TV and disc: Sunrise leaned into streaming windows (e.g., \"Thunderbolt\" paid online releases), YouTube premieres (\"Re:RISE\"), and recurring event screenings (\"THE ORIGIN\"), while Bandai Namco continued to cultivate hobbyists via Gunpla-driven exhibits and product cycles connected to on-air beats. Taken together, the decade's output reflected a calibrated portfolio: child-oriented \u201cBuild\u201d cycles, late-night originals, digitally led UC projects, and a high-visibility Sunday-evening drama in \"IBO,\" that extended Gundam's reach globally via streaming while repeatedly attempting to onboard younger generations without abandoning longtime fans.\n2020s: Cross-media maturity, capacity strains, and renewed TV impact (2021\u2013present).\nThe 2020s opened with Gundam operating at a full cross-media scale: films, television, streaming, live events, and VR; while the broader anime industry faced structural labor shortages that tightened schedules and shortened production horizons. Trade and mainstream reporting in Japan throughout 2024\u201325 described a chronic shortfall of skilled animators and CG staff, cost inflation, and knock-on delays, with surveys noting deteriorating margins at many mid-tier contractors despite topline demand growth. Even as the Association of Japanese Animations tallied record market size, commentators warned that capacity constraints were leading committees to favor contained or split-cour runs and diversify pipelines (digital paint/CG, overseas vendors) to keep pace.\nOn the corporate side, the 2010s and early 2020s also saw structural changes in the stewardship of the Gundam franchise. Sunrise, long the animation studio responsible for Gundam, was reorganized within Bandai Namco Holdings in 2021 as \"Bandai Namco Filmworks\", reflecting the group's push toward an \u201cIP axis\u201d strategy that more tightly integrated animation, live action, and event production. Separately, Gundam's licensing agent Sotsu\u2014which had co-owned the rights to the property since the late 1970s\u2014was merged into Bandai Namco Holdings in 2020, ending decades of dual-rights management and consolidating control of the franchise within the group. These reorganizations allowed Bandai Namco to centralize production and licensing under a unified corporate structure, aligning the Gundam IP more closely with the company's global multimedia and merchandising strategies.\nOn television, \"\" (2022\u201323) reactivated MBS/TBS's national \u201cNichigo\u201d slot after a five-year hiatus and broadened Gundam's reach among school-age and young-adult viewers with a contemporary school setting, social-media traction, and a two-cour format tailored to modern broadcast cadence.\nIn cinemas, momentum carried into \"Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Freedom\" (2024), which set the franchise's all-time box office record and confirmed the SEED sub-brand's long-tail appeal in the streaming era. Bandai Namco's IR feature in 2024 explicitly framed the film as a driver of IP value expansion, and one-year anniversary tallies reported more than \u00a55.3\u20136.2 billion in receipts (depending on cutoff), the highest for a Gundam theatrical release.\nGlobal streaming platforms, particularly Netflix, became central to Gundam's international reach in the 2020s. ' (2021) followed its Japanese theatrical release with a worldwide Netflix launch, offering same-week access across many territories and establishing a distribution model Sunrise would revisit for UC-branded projects. This was followed by ' (2024), an Unreal Engine 5 production co-created with SAFEHOUSE and released globally as a Netflix exclusive, serving both as a technical showcase and as an experiment in simultaneous worldwide distribution within the Universal Century.\nOutside traditional screens, Bandai Namco Filmworks and Atlas V launched the VR film \"\" for Meta Quest in October 2024; the project was later selected for Annecy\u2019s VR program, emblematic of Gundam\u2019s willingness to trial immersive formats tied to UC lore.\nBy 2025, Sunrise (Bandai Namco Filmworks) pivoted back to a major \u201cgateway\u201d television push with \"Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX\", a high-profile co-production with Studio Khara. A theatrical compilation of the opening episodes (\"GQuuuuuuX Beginning\") premiered in Japan on January 17, 2025, with a limited global run ahead of the TV broadcast. The rollout included IMAX, 4DX/MX4D, and re-release screenings, and by late July, box office receipts had surpassed \u00a535.8 billion\u2014second only to \"SEED Freedom\" among Gundam films\u2014underscoring the strategy's goal of re-energizing lapsed fans before the series\u2019 TV debut. The series itself was notable for presenting an alternate Universal Century timeline, reimagining the events of the original \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" with Char Aznable as its central protagonist\u2014positioning it as both a bold narrative experiment and a cross-generational entry point for the franchise.\nLooking ahead, after early development with Netflix, the long-gestating Hollywood live-action \"Gundam\" feature is now positioned as a Legendary Pictures theatrical project with Jim Mickle set to write and direct; corporate and trade reports through late 2024\u2013mid-2025 describe the shift to theaters and a production start target within 2025.\nOn the merchandising front, Gunpla remained the merchandising backbone, with cumulative shipments surpassing 700 million by early 2022 and Bandai Namco reporting record-high group sales in FY 2024\u201325 as it leaned into \u201cIP-axis\u201d rollouts.\nSmartphone gacha titles became a third pillar for the \"Gundam\" IP in the 2020s. \"Mobile Suit Gundam U.C. Engage\" (2021, JP; global Oct 17, 2023) paired monthly, anime-quality story drops with 6-on-6 play in the Universal Century, crossing 3 million Japanese downloads by October 2023 and posting ~US$0.54 million on ~433k downloads in its first two weeks after the global launch. Sunrise/BNE foregrounded the production values through the official \u201cEngage Documents\u201d making-of series and promotional copy emphasizing animated story presentation. The pipeline broadened further with \"SD Gundam G Generation ETERNAL\" (launched April 16, 2025), which surpassed US$100 million in its first two months, underscoring the genre's scale for the brand.\nGundam also evolved into a global tourism draw, building on the life-size statue projects first established in the late 2000s and 2010s. In Japan, installations such as the RX-93ff \u03bd Gundam at LaLaport Fukuoka (2022) and the moving RX-78F00 at Gundam Factory Yokohama (2020\u20132024)\u2014extended due to worldwide demand and concluded with a large-scale finale event\u2014functioned as anchor attractions, with a new RX-78F00/E announced for the \u201cGundam Next Future Pavilion\u201d at Expo 2025 Osaka. Overseas, Bandai Namco introduced the first full-scale statue outside Japan with the Freedom Gundam in Shanghai (2021), and expanded global engagement through \u201cGundam Docks\u201d exhibitions and touring retail-experience formats, including \u201cThe Gundam Base Mobile/Pop-Up World Tour\u201d and the U.S. Mobile Tour (2024\u20132025). Collectively, these deployments positioned Gundam as a \u201cpilgrimage\u201d brand for inbound visitors and overseas fans, complementing screen releases with destination-style attractions and large-scale experiential events.\nTaken together, the 2020s have been characterized by two countervailing forces: structural strain in Japan's anime production capacity and Gundam's simultaneous broad-spectrum growth via television hits (\"Witch from Mercury\"), record-setting films (\"SEED Freedom\"), global streaming originals (\"Requiem for Vengeance\"), new-format experiments (\"Silver Phantom\" VR), and large-scale pre-broadcast theatrical plays (\"GQuuuuuuX\"). Bandai Namco's disclosures frame the franchise around an \u201cIP-axis\u201d model designed to reach multiple audiences\u2014Universal Century projects sustaining legacy fans, alternate universe series recruiting new cohorts, and Gunpla and live events converting screen engagement into durable revenue. In this framework, large-scale attractions such as the RX-93ff \u03bd Gundam in Fukuoka, the moving RX-78F00 at Gundam Factory Yokohama, and overseas deployments like the Freedom Gundam in Shanghai or the U.S. Mobile Tour function as tourism pillars, reinforcing Gundam's status as both a screen property and a destination brand within Bandai Namco's global multimedia strategy.\nMedia.\nTV series, films, and video.\nExcept for \"Mobile Suit Gundam 00\", which follows the current calendar era albeit three centuries in the future, all \"Gundam\" series are set in a fictional era, with a new calendar adopted after a drastic event or chain of events and typically involving a major conflict involving Earth and space colonies (and in some cases the Moon and terraformed planets). An exception are the \"Gundam Build\" timelines, which are set in an alternate present time where all other \"Gundam\" installments are fictional.\nLive-action film.\nAt the 2018 Anime Expo, Legendary Pictures and Sunrise announced a collaboration to develop a live-action \"Gundam\" film. Brian K. Vaughan was brought in to write and serve as an executive producer for the film. In April 2021, it was reported that the project had landed at Netflix and that Jordan Vogt-Roberts had been hired to direct. In October 2024, it was announced that Jim Mickle would be the new director and writer, and that Netflix was no longer involved. In March 2025, \"Deadline\" reported that actress Sydney Sweeney is in talks for a role. In September 2025, there have been reports that Benson Boone and Drew Starkey are in talks to join the movie. On November 21, 2025, it was reported that Starkey has dropped out of the movie and Noah Centineo is in talks for the lead.\nManga and novels.\nManga adaptations of the \"Gundam\" series have been published in English in North America by a number of companies, such as Viz Media, Del Rey Manga and Tokyopop, and in Singapore by Chuang Yi. Notable entries include \"\", written and illustrated by original series character designer Yoshikazu Yasuhiko. It is a retelling of the first series with additional flashbacks surrounding one of the series' main characters, Char Aznable.\nVideo games.\n\"Gundam\" has spawned over 80 video games for arcade, computer and console platforms, some with characters not found in other \"Gundam\" media. Some of the games, in turn, inspired spinoff novels and manga.\nGunpla.\nPrimarily made of plastic, but sometimes paired with resin and metal detail parts, hundreds of \"Gundam\" scale plastic models, known as Gunpla, have been released since the early 1980s. They range in quality from toolless-build children's toy kits (Entry Grades) to hobbyist and museum-grade models, and most are in common scales such as 1:35, 1:48, 1:60, 1:100, or 1:144. Various Grades exist to target hobbyists, ranging from smaller-sized kits such as High Grade and Real Grade to larger Master Grade and Perfect Grade model kits. The Real Grade (RG) Gundam series combines the Master Grade's detailed inner structure with additional color separation, making the 1:144-scale series complex in design and compact in size, with the final goal of retooling a Gundam to what it might look like in real life, similar to the full-size Gundam statues.\nPromotional 1:6 or 1:12 scale models are supplied to retailers and are not commercially available. For \"Gundam\"'s 30th anniversary, a full-size RX-78-2 Gundam model was constructed and displayed at Gundam Front Tokyo in the Odaiba district; it was taken down on March 5, 2017. A new statue of the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam was erected at the same location, now renamed The Gundam Base Tokyo.\nOther merchandise.\nBandai, \"Gundam\"'s primary licensee, produces a variety of products. Other companies produce unofficial merchandise, such as toys, models and T-shirts. Products include Mobile Suit in Action (MSiA) action figures and Gundam model kits in several scales and design complexities. Each series generally has its own set of products, MSiA and model lines such as Master Grade and High Grade Universal Century, which h may extend across series. The most popular action figure line has been the Gundam Fix series, which includes the mecha in the animated series, manga, novels and accessories to create an updated version. In addition to Master Grade and High Grade Gundams, Bandai released a 30th-anniversary series of Gundam models in 2010. After the introduction of the RG Gunpla line, Bandai released the Metal Build series in March 2011, beginning with the 00 Gundam.\nOnline engagement.\nBandai Namco Filmworks maintains several official websites to promote \"Gundam\" projects. The main Japanese-language portal is \"Gundam Perfect Web\", which provides news, product information, and event updates.\nIn July 2025, Bandai Namco Filmworks announced that the longstanding portal \"Gundam.info\" is undergoing a major overhaul, to be rebranded as the \"Gundam Official Website\". This new site, to be hosted at https://, is slated to launch in 2025 and will serve as the international hub for series information, news, and product updates, replacing \"Gundam.info\".\nIn 2005, \"Gundam.info\"\u2019s English counterpart hosted the \"Gundam Official User Forum\", which was based on the fan-run \"Gundam Watch\" forum and used many of its moderators. After the forum\u2019s closure, \"Gundam Watch\" re-emerged independently as \"Gundam Evolution\".\nSeries-specific promotional websites have also been created to highlight character info, mecha designs, merchandise, and special content like wallpapers or mini-games. For example, the \"Superior Defender Gundam Force\" site featured an interactive game where the player takes control of Commander Sazabi in a comedic scenario.\nThe franchise also maintains an active presence on social media platforms, including Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok, where official accounts post trailers, Gunpla showcases, news updates, and livestream content aimed at fans worldwide.\nGlobal spread.\n\"Gundam\" began expanding beyond Japan in the early 1980s through television broadcasts and home-video distribution across East and Southeast Asia, followed by Europe and the Americas in the 1990s, aided by Bandai\u2019s international licensing and merchandise programs. In North America, mainstream recognition increased dramatically in 2000 when \"Mobile Suit Gundam Wing\" premiered on Cartoon Network\u2019s Toonami block; industry trade coverage at the time noted Toonami\u2019s rising kids\u2019 ratings and cited \"Gundam Wing\" as a key acquisition driving the block's expansion that year. Subsequent home-video partnerships widened catalog access in the mid-2010s, including Sunrise's 2014 distribution agreement with Right Stuf/Nozomi for legacy \"Gundam\" titles in North America. In Europe, the brand's visibility has been reinforced by major pop culture events, with media in France highlighting Bandai hobby exhibits and large-scale Gunpla activations at Japan Expo in Paris. More recently, global streaming has accelerated international reach; for example, Netflix announced a worldwide debut for the Unreal Engine-produced series \"Gundam: Requiem for Vengeance\", underscoring the franchise's contemporary, simultaneous release strategy outside Japan. Collectively, these developments\u2014broadcast exposure, hobby merchandising, event marketing, home-video partnerships, and day-and-date streaming\u2014have driven the franchise's sustained overseas growth and helped standardize access to both classic catalog and new installments.\nImpact.\n\"Gundam\" is a Japanese cultural icon and a multi-billion-yen annual business for Bandai Namco. Annual revenue for the franchise reached \u00a554.5 billion by 2006, \u00a5 by 2014, and \u00a5 by 2024. Examples of its cultural ubiquity in the country include the issuing of Gundam stamps, an Agriculture Ministry employee being reprimanded for contributing to Japanese Wikipedia \"Gundam\"-related pages, and the Japan Self-Defense Forces code-naming its developing advanced personal-combat system Gundam. Based on a December 16, 2023 survey conducted by \"Nikkei Entertainment\", the fanbase of \"Gundam\" within Japan has an average age of 42 years, and a male-to-female ratio that skews 90:10. The impact of \"Gundam\" in Japan has been compared to the impact of \"Star Wars\" in the United States.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50711", "revid": "13783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50711", "title": "Middle English", "text": "English language during the Middle Ages\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nMiddle English (abbreviated to ME) is the forms of the English language that were spoken in England after the Norman Conquest of 1066, until the late 15th century, roughly coinciding with the High and Late Middle Ages. The Middle English dialects displaced the Old English dialects under the influence of Anglo-Norman French and Old Norse, and were in turn replaced in England by Early Modern English.\nMiddle English had significant regional variety and churn in its vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and orthography. The main dialects were Northern, East Midland, West Midland, and Southern in England, as well as Early Scots and the Irish Fingallian and Yola.\nDuring the Middle English period, many Old English grammatical features either became simplified or disappeared altogether. Noun, adjective, and verb inflections were simplified by the reduction (and eventual elimination) of most grammatical case distinctions. Middle English also saw considerable adoption of Anglo-Norman vocabulary, especially in the areas of politics, law, the arts, and religion, as well as poetic and emotive diction. Conventional English vocabulary remained primarily Germanic in its sources, with Old Norse influences becoming more apparent. Significant changes in pronunciation took place, particularly involving long vowels and diphthongs, which in the later Middle English period began to undergo the Great Vowel Shift.\nLittle survives of early Middle English literature, due in part to Norman domination and the prestige that came with writing in French rather than English. During the 14th century, a new style of literature emerged with the works of writers including John Wycliffe and Geoffrey Chaucer, whose \"Canterbury Tales\" remains the most studied and read work of the period.\nBy the end of the period (about 1470), and aided by the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1439, a standard based on the London dialects (Chancery Standard) had become established. This largely formed the basis for Modern English spelling, although pronunciation has changed considerably since that time. In England, Middle English was succeeded by Early Modern English, which lasted until about 1650. In Scotland, Scots developed concurrently from a variant of the Northumbrian dialect (prevalent in Northern England and spoken in southeast Scotland).\nHistory.\nTransition from Old English.\nThe transition from Late Old English to Early Middle English had taken place by the 1150s to 1180s, the period when the Augustinian canon Orrm wrote the \"Ormulum\", one of the oldest surviving texts in Middle English.\nContact with Old Norse aided the development of English from a synthetic language with relatively free word order to a more analytic language with a stricter word order, as both Old English and Old Norse were synthetic languages with complicated inflections. Communication between Vikings in the Danelaw and their Anglo-Saxon neighbours resulted in the erosion of inflection in both languages; this effect was characterized as being of a \"substantive, pervasive, and of a democratic\" manner. Like close cousins, Old Norse and Old English resembled each other, and with a lot of vocabulary and grammatical structures in common, speakers of each language roughly understood each other, but according to the historian Simeon Potler, the main difference lay in their inflectional endings, which led to much confusion within the mixed population that existed in the Danelaw, thus endings tended gradually to become obscured and finally lost, \"simplifying English grammar\" in the process, leading to the emergence of the analytic pattern. The dramatic changes that happened in English contribute to the acceptance of the hypothesis that Old Norse had a more profound impact on the development of Middle and Modern English than any other language. \nViking influence on Old English is most apparent in pronouns, modals, comparatives, pronominal adverbs (like \"hence\" and \"together\"), conjunctions, and prepositions show the most marked Danish influence. The best evidence of Scandinavian influence appears in extensive word borrowings; however, texts from the period in Scandinavia and Northern England do not provide certain evidence of an influence on syntax.\nWhile the Old Norse influence was strongest in the dialects under Danish control, which approximately covered Yorkshire, the central and eastern Midlands, and the East of England, words in the spoken language emerged in the 10th and 11th centuries near the transition from Old to Middle English. Influence on the written languages only appeared from the beginning of the 13th century onwards; this delay in Scandinavian lexical influence in English has been attributed to the lack of written evidence from the areas of Danish control, as the majority of written sources from Old English were produced in the West Saxon dialect spoken in Wessex, the heart of Anglo-Saxon political power at the time.\nThe Norman Conquest of England in 1066 saw the replacement of the top levels of the English-speaking political and ecclesiastical hierarchies by Norman rulers who spoke a dialect of Old French, now known as Old Norman, which developed in England into Anglo-Norman. The use of Norman as the preferred language of literature and polite discourse fundamentally altered the role of Old English in education and administration, even though many Normans of this period were illiterate and depended on the clergy for written communication and record-keeping. A significant number of Norman words were borrowed into English and used alongside native Germanic words with similar meanings. Examples of Germanic/Norman pairs in Modern English include \"pig\" and \"pork\", \"calf\" and \"veal\", \"wood\" and \"forest\", and \"freedom\" and \"liberty\".\nThe role of Anglo-Norman as the language of government and law can be seen in the abundance of Modern English words for the mechanisms of government that are derived from Anglo-Norman, such as \"court\", \"judge\", \"jury\", \"appeal\", and \"parliament\". There are also many Norman-derived terms relating to the chivalric cultures that arose in the 12th century, an era of feudalism, seigneurialism, and crusading.\nWords were often taken from Latin, usually through French transmission. This gave rise to various synonyms, including \"kingly\" (inherited from Old English), \"royal\" (from French, inherited from Vulgar Latin), and \"regal\" (from French, which borrowed it from Classical Latin). Later French appropriations were derived from standard, rather than Norman, French. Examples of the resulting doublet pairs include \"warden\" (from Norman) and \"guardian\" (from later French; both share a common ancestor loaned from Germanic).\nThe end of Anglo-Saxon rule did not result in immediate changes to the language. The general population would have spoken the same dialects as they had before the Conquest. Once the writing of Old English came to an end, Middle English had no standard language, only dialects that evolved individually from Old English.\nRalph d'Escures\u2019\n\"Homily on the Virgin Mary\", a French work translated into Latin and then English in the first half of the 12th Century, was either one of \"the very latest compositions in Old English, or, as some scholars would\nhave it, the very earliest in Middle English,\" having an Old English vocabulary co-existing with simplified inflexion.\nEarly Middle English.\nEarly Middle English (1150\u20131350) has a largely Anglo-Saxon vocabulary (with many Norse borrowings in the northern parts of the country) but a greatly simplified inflectional system. The grammatical relations that were expressed in Old English by the dative and instrumental cases were replaced in Early Middle English with prepositional constructions. The Old English genitive - survives in the \"-'s\" of the modern English possessive, but most of the other case endings disappeared in the Early Middle English period, including most of the roughly one dozen forms of the definite article (\"the\"). The dual personal pronouns (denoting exactly two) also disappeared from English during this period.\nThe loss of case endings was part of a general trend from inflections to fixed word order that also occurred in other Germanic languages (though more slowly and to a lesser extent). Therefore, it cannot be attributed simply to the influence of French-speaking sections of the population; English did, after all, remain the vernacular. It is also argued that Norse immigrants to England had a great impact on the loss of inflectional endings in Middle English. One argument is that, although Norse and English speakers were somewhat comprehensible to each other due to similar morphology, the Norse speakers' inability to reproduce the ending sounds of English words influenced Middle English's loss of inflectional endings.\nImportant texts for the reconstruction of the evolution of Middle English out of Old English are the \"Peterborough Chronicle\", which continued to be compiled up to 1154; the \"Ormulum\", a biblical commentary probably composed in Lincolnshire in the second half of the 12th century, incorporating a unique phonetic spelling system; and the and the Katherine Group, religious texts written for anchoresses, apparently in the West Midlands in the early 13th century. The language found in the last two works is sometimes called the AB language, one of a range of regional dialects: East Midlands (London), South West (Kentish), Western (AB) and Northern.\nAdditional literary sources of the 12th and 13th centuries include \"Layamon's Brut\" and \"The Owl and the Nightingale\".\nSome scholars have defined \"Early Middle English\" as encompassing English texts up to 1350. This longer time frame would extend the corpus to include many Middle English Romances (especially those of the \"Auchinleck manuscript\" c.\u20091330).\nLate Middle English.\nGradually, the wealthy and the government Anglicised again, although Norman (and subsequently French) remained the dominant language of literature and law until the 14th century, even after the loss of the majority of the continental possessions of the English monarchy. \nIn the aftermath of the Black Death in the 14th century, there was significant migration into London, particularly from the counties of the East of England and the East Midlands and, to a lesser extent, from the West Midlands and the North of England, and a new prestige London dialect began to develop as a result of this clash of the different dialects, that was based chiefly on the speech of the East Midlands (roughly corresponding to the official regions of the East of England and the East Midlands) but also influenced by that of other regions. The writing of this period, however, continues to reflect a variety of regional forms of English. The , a translation of a French confessional prose work, completed in 1340, is written in a Kentish dialect. The best known writer of Middle English, Geoffrey Chaucer, wrote in the second half of the 14th century in the emerging London dialect, although he also portrays some of his characters as speaking in northern dialects, as in \"The Reeve's Tale\".\nIn the English-speaking areas of lowland Scotland, an independent standard was developing, based on the Northumbrian dialect. This would develop into what came to be known as the Scots language.\nA large number of terms for abstract concepts were adopted directly from scholastic philosophical Latin (rather than via French). Examples are \"absolute\", \"act\", \"demonstration\", and \"probable\".\nTransition to Early Modern English.\nThe Chancery Standard of written English emerged c.\u20091430 in official documents that, since the Norman Conquest, had normally been written in French. Like Chaucer's work, this new standard was based on the East Midlands-influenced speech of London. Clerks using this standard were usually familiar with French and Latin, influencing the forms they chose. The Chancery Standard, which was adopted slowly, was used in England by bureaucrats for most official purposes, excluding those of the Church and legalities, which used Latin and Law French respectively.\nThe Chancery Standard's influence on later forms of written English is disputed, but it did undoubtedly provide the core around which Early Modern English formed. Early Modern English emerged with the help of William Caxton's printing press, developed during the 1470s. The press stabilized English through a push towards standardization, led by Chancery Standard enthusiast and writer Richard Pynson. Early Modern English began in the 1540s after the printing and wide distribution of the English Bible and Prayer Book, which made the new standard of English publicly recognisable and lasted until about 1650.\nPhonology.\nThe main changes between the Old English sound system and that of Middle English include:\nThe combination of the last three processes listed above led to the spelling conventions associated with silent \u27e8e\u27e9 and doubled consonants (see under Orthography, below).\nMorphology.\nNouns.\nMiddle English retains only two distinct noun-ending patterns from the more complex system of inflection in Old English:\nNouns of the weak declension are primarily inherited from Old English \"n\"-stem nouns but also from \"\u014d\"-stem, \"w\u014d\"-stem, and \"u\"-stem nouns, which did not inflect in the same way as \"n\"-stem nouns in Old English, but joined the weak declension in Middle English. Nouns of the strong declension are inherited from the other Old English noun stem classes.\nSome nouns of the strong type have an \"-e\" in the nominative/accusative singular, like the weak declension, but otherwise strong endings. Often, these are the same nouns that had an \"-e\" in the nominative/accusative singular of Old English (they, in turn, were inherited from Proto-Germanic \"ja\"-stem and \"i\"-stem nouns).\nThe distinct dative case was lost in early Middle English, and although the genitive survived, by the end of the Middle English period only the strong \"-'s\" ending (variously spelled) was in use. Some formerly feminine nouns, as well as some weak nouns, continued to make their genitive forms with \"-e\" or no ending (e.g., , horses' hooves), and nouns of relationship ending in \"-er\" frequently have no genitive ending (e.g., , \"father's bane\").\nThe strong \"-(e)s\" plural form has survived into Modern English. The weak \"-(e)n\" form is now rare and used only in \"oxen\" and as part of a double plural, in \"children\" and \"brethren\". Some dialects still have forms such as \"eyen\" (for \"eyes\"), \"shoon\" (for \"shoes\"), \"hosen\" (for \"hose(s)\"), \"kine\" (for \"cows\"), and \"been\" (for \"bees\").\nGrammatical gender survived to a limited extent in early Middle English before being replaced by natural gender in the course of the Middle English period. Grammatical gender was indicated by agreement of articles and pronouns (e.g., \"the feminine owl\") or using the pronoun to refer to masculine nouns such as (\"helmet\"), or phrases such as (strong shaft), with the masculine accusative adjective ending \"-ne\".\nAdjectives.\nSingle-syllable adjectives added ' when modifying a noun in the plural and when used after the definite article (), after a demonstrative (, ), after a possessive pronoun (e.g., , ), or with a name or in a form of address. This derives from the Old English \"weak\" declension of adjectives. This inflexion continued to be used in writing even after final -e had ceased to be pronounced. In earlier texts, multisyllable adjectives also receive a final \"-e\" in these situations, but this occurs less regularly in later Middle English texts. Otherwise, adjectives have no ending and adjectives already ending in ' etymologically receive no ending as well.\nEarlier texts sometimes inflect adjectives for case as well. \"Layamon's Brut\" inflects adjectives for the masculine accusative, genitive, and dative, the feminine dative, and the plural genitive. \"The Owl and the Nightingale\" adds a final \"-e\" to all adjectives not in the nominative, here only inflecting adjectives in the weak declension (as described above).\nComparatives and superlatives were usually formed by adding ' and '. Adjectives with long vowels sometimes shortened these vowels in the comparative and superlative (e.g., , great; , greater). Adjectives ending in ' or ' formed comparatives either with ', ' or ', '. A few adjectives also displayed Germanic umlaut in their comparatives and superlatives, such as , . Other irregular forms were mostly the same as in modern English.\nPronouns.\nMiddle English personal pronouns were mostly developed from those of Old English, with the exception of the third person plural, a borrowing from Old Norse. (The original Old English form clashed with the third person singular and was eventually dropped.) Also, the nominative form of the feminine third person singular was replaced by a form of the demonstrative that developed into (modern \"she\"), but the alternative remained in some areas for a long time.\nAs with nouns, there was some inflectional simplification (the distinct Old English dual forms were lost), but pronouns, unlike nouns, retained distinct nominative and accusative forms. Third person pronouns also retained a distinction between accusative and dative forms, but that was gradually lost: The masculine was replaced by south of the River Thames by the early 14th century, and the neuter dative was ousted by \"it\" in most dialects by the 15th.\nThe following table shows some of the various Middle English pronouns. Many other variations are noted in Middle English sources because of differences in spellings and pronunciations at different times and in different dialects.\nVerbs.\nAs a general rule, the indicative first person singular of verbs in the present tense ended in \"-e\" (e.g., , \"I hear\"), the second person singular in \"-(e)st\" (e.g., , \"thou speakest\"), and the third person singular in \"-e\u00fe\" (e.g., , \"he cometh/he comes\"). (\"\u00fe\" (the letter \"thorn\") is pronounced like the unvoiced \"th\" in \"think\", but under certain circumstances, it may be like the voiced \"th\" in \"that\"). The following table illustrates a typical conjugation pattern:\nPlural forms vary strongly by dialect, with Southern dialects preserving the Old English \"-e\u00fe\", Midland dialects showing \"-en\" from about 1200, and Northern forms using \"-es\" in the third person singular as well as the plural.\nThe past tense of weak verbs was formed by adding an \"-ed(e)\", \"-d(e)\", or \"-t(e)\" ending. The past-tense forms, without their personal endings, also served as past participles with past-participle prefixes derived from Old English: \"i-\", \"y-\", and sometimes \"bi-\".\nStrong verbs, by contrast, formed their past tense by changing their stem vowel (e.g., became , a process called apophony), as in Modern English.\nOrthography.\nWith the discontinuation of the Late West Saxon standard used for the writing of Old English in the period prior to the Norman Conquest, Middle English came to be written in a wide variety of scribal forms, reflecting different regional dialects and orthographic conventions. Later in the Middle English period, however, and particularly with the development of the Chancery Standard in the 15th century, orthography became relatively standardised in a form based on the East Midlands-influenced speech of London. Spelling at the time was mostly quite regular. (There was a fairly consistent correspondence between letters and sounds.) The irregularity of present-day English orthography is largely due to pronunciation changes that have taken place over the Early Modern English and Modern English eras.\nMiddle English generally did not have silent letters. For example, \"knight\" was pronounced (with both the \u27e8k\u27e9 and the \u27e8gh\u27e9 pronounced, the latter sounding as the \u27e8ch\u27e9 in German ). The major exception was the silent \u27e8e\u27e9 \u2013 originally pronounced but lost in normal speech by Chaucer's time. This letter, however, came to indicate a lengthened \u2013 and later also modified \u2013 pronunciation of a preceding vowel. For example, in \"name\", originally pronounced as two syllables, the /a/ in the first syllable (originally an open syllable) lengthened, the final weak vowel was later dropped, and the remaining long vowel was modified in the Great Vowel Shift (for these sound changes, see Phonology, above). The final \u27e8e\u27e9, now silent, thus became the indicator of the longer and changed pronunciation of \u27e8a\u27e9. In fact, vowels could have this lengthened and modified pronunciation in various positions, particularly before a single consonant letter and another vowel or before certain pairs of consonants.\nA related convention involved the doubling of consonant letters to show that the preceding vowel was not to be lengthened. In some cases, the double consonant represented a sound that was (or had previously been) geminated (i.e., had genuinely been \"doubled\" and would thus have regularly blocked the lengthening of the preceding vowel). In other cases, by analogy, the consonant was written double merely to indicate the lack of lengthening.\nAlphabet.\nThe basic Old English Latin alphabet consisted of 20 standard letters plus four additional letters: ash \u27e8\u00e6\u27e9, eth \u27e8\u00f0\u27e9, thorn \u27e8\u00fe\u27e9, and wynn \u27e8\u01bf\u27e9. There was not yet a distinct \"j\", \"v\", or \"w\", and Old English scribes did not generally use \"k\", \"q\", or \"z\".\nAsh was no longer required in Middle English, as the Old English vowel that it represented had merged into /a/. The symbol nonetheless came to be used as a ligature for the digraph \u27e8ae\u27e9 in many words of Greek or Latin origin, as did \u27e8\u0153\u27e9 for \u27e8oe\u27e9.\nEth and thorn both represented or its allophone in Old English. Eth fell out of use during the 13th century and was replaced by thorn. Thorn mostly fell out of use during the 14th century and was replaced by \u27e8th\u27e9. Anachronistic usage of the scribal abbreviation (, \"the\") has led to the modern mispronunciation of \"thorn\" as \u27e8y\u27e9 in this context; see \"ye olde\".\nWynn, which represented the phoneme , was replaced by \u27e8w\u27e9 during the 13th century. Due to its similarity to the letter \u27e8p\u27e9, it is mostly represented by \u27e8w\u27e9 in modern editions of Old and Middle English texts even when the manuscript has wynn.\nUnder Norman influence, the continental Carolingian minuscule replaced the insular script that had been used for Old English. However, because of the significant difference in appearance between the old insular \"g\" and the Carolingian \"g\" (modern \"g\"), the former continued in use as a separate letter, known as yogh, written \u27e8\u021d\u27e9. This was adopted for use to represent a variety of sounds: , while the Carolingian \"g\" was normally used for [g]. Instances of yogh were eventually replaced by \u27e8j\u27e9 or \u27e8y\u27e9 and by \u27e8gh\u27e9 in words like \"night\" and \"laugh\". In Middle Scots, yogh became indistinguishable from cursive \"z\", and printers tended to use \u27e8z\u27e9 when \"yogh\" was not available in their fonts; this led to new spellings (often giving rise to new pronunciations), as in \"McKenzie\", where the \u27e8z\u27e9 replaced a yogh, which had the pronunciation .\nUnder continental influence, the letters \u27e8k\u27e9, \u27e8q\u27e9, and \u27e8z\u27e9, which had not normally been used by Old English scribes, came to be commonly used in the writing of Middle English. Also, the newer Latin letter \u27e8w\u27e9 was introduced (replacing wynn). The distinct letter forms \u27e8v\u27e9 and \u27e8u\u27e9 came into use but were still used interchangeably; the same applies to \u27e8j\u27e9 and \u27e8i\u27e9. (For example, spellings such as and for \"wife\" and \"paradise\" can be found in Middle English.)\nThe consonantal \u27e8j\u27e9/\u27e8i\u27e9 was sometimes used to transliterate the Hebrew letter yodh, representing the palatal approximant sound (and transliterated in Greek by iota and in Latin by \u27e8i\u27e9); words like \"Jerusalem\", \"Joseph\", etc. would have originally followed the Latin pronunciation beginning with , that is, the sound of \u27e8y\u27e9 in \"yes\". In some words, however, notably from Old French, \u27e8j\u27e9/\u27e8i\u27e9 was used for the affricate consonant , as in (modern \"joy\"), used in Wycliffe's Bible. This was similar to the geminate sound , which had been represented as \u27e8cg\u27e9 in Old English. By the time of Modern English, the sound came to be written as \u27e8j\u27e9/\u27e8i\u27e9 at the start of words (like \"joy\"), and usually as \u27e8dg\u27e9 elsewhere (as in \"bridge\"). It could also be written, mainly in French loanwords, as \u27e8g\u27e9, with the adoption of the soft G convention (\"age\", \"page\", etc.)\nOther symbols.\nMany scribal abbreviations were also used. It was common for the Lollards to abbreviate the name of Jesus (as in Latin manuscripts) to \"ihc\". The letters \u27e8n\u27e9 and \u27e8m\u27e9 were often omitted and indicated by a macron above an adjacent letter, so for example, \"in\" could be written as \"\u012b\". A thorn with a superscript \u27e8t\u27e9 or \u27e8e\u27e9 could be used for \"that\" and \"the\"; the thorn here resembled a \u27e8Y\u27e9, giving rise to the \"ye\" of \"Ye Olde\". Various forms of the ampersand replaced the word \"and\".\nNumbers were still always written using Roman numerals, except for some rare occurrences of Arabic numerals during the 15th century.\nLetter-to-sound correspondences.\nAlthough Middle English spelling was never fully standardised, the following table shows the pronunciations most usually represented by particular letters and digraphs towards the end of the Middle English period, using the notation given in the article on Middle English phonology. As explained above, single vowel letters had alternative pronunciations depending on whether they were in a position where their sounds had been subject to lengthening. Long vowel pronunciations were in flux due to the beginnings of the Great Vowel Shift.\nSample texts.\nMost of the following Modern English translations are poetic sense-for-sense translations, not word-for-word translations.\nOrmulum, 12th century.\nThis passage explains the background to the Nativity :\nEpitaph of John the smyth, died 1371.\nAn epitaph from a monumental brass in an Oxfordshire parish church:\nWycliffite Bibles.\nFrom the Wycliffe's Bible:\nChaucer, 1390s.\nThe following is the very beginning of the General Prologue from \"The Canterbury Tales\" by Geoffrey Chaucer. The text was written in a dialect associated with London and spellings associated with the then-emergent Chancery Standard.\nGower, 1390.\nThe following is the beginning of the Prologue from \"Confessio Amantis\" by John Gower.\nTranslation in Modern English: (by J.

{"id": "50712", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50712", "title": "Regional science", "text": "Field of the social sciences\nRegional science is a field of economics concerned with analytical approaches to problems that are related specifically to regional and international issues. Topics in regional science include, but are not limited to location theory or spatial economics, location modeling, transportation, trade and migration flows, economic geography, land use and urban development, inter-industry analysis such as input-output analysis, environmental and ecological analysis, resource management, urban and regional policy analysis, and spatial data analysis. In the broadest sense, any social science analysis that has a spatial dimension is embraced by regional scientists.\nOrigins.\nRegional science was founded in the late 1940s when some economists began to become dissatisfied with the low level of regional economic analysis and felt an urge to upgrade it. But even in this early era, the founders of regional science expected to catch the interest of people from a wide variety of disciplines. Regional science's formal roots date to the aggressive campaigns by Walter Isard and his supporters to promote the \"objective\" and \"scientific\" analysis of settlement, industrial location, and urban development. Isard targeted key universities and campaigned tirelessly. Accordingly, the Regional Science Association was founded in 1954, when the core group of scholars and practitioners held its first meetings independent from those initially held as sessions of the annual meetings of the American Economics Association. A reason for meeting independently undoubtedly was the group's desire to extend the new science beyond the rather restrictive world of economists and have natural scientists, psychologists, anthropologists, lawyers, sociologists, political scientists, planners, and geographers join the club. Now called the Regional Science Association International (RSAI), it maintains subnational and international associations, journals, and a conference circuit (notably in North America, continental Europe, Japan, and South Korea). Membership in the RSAI continues to grow.\nSeminal publications.\nTopically speaking, regional science took off in the wake of Walter Christaller's book \"Die Zentralen Orte in S\u0171ddeutschland\" (Verlag von Gustav Fischer, Jena, 1933; transl. \"Central Places in Southern Germany\", 1966), soon followed by Tord Palander's (1935) \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur Standortstheorie\"; August L\u00f6sch's \"Die r\u00e4umliche Ordnung der Wirtschaft\" (Verlag von Gustav Fischer, Jena, 1940; 2nd rev. edit., 1944; transl. \"The Economics of Location\", 1954); and Edgar M. Hoover's two books--\"Location Theory and the Shoe and Leather Industry\" (1938) and \"The Location of Economic Activity\" (1948). Other important early publications include: Edward H. Chamberlin's (1950) \"The Theory of Monopolistic Competition\"; Fran\u00e7ois Perroux's (1950) \"Economic Spaces: Theory and Application\"; Torsten H\u00e4gerstrand's (1953) \"Innovationsf\u00f6rloppet ur Korologisk Synpunkt\"; Edgar S. Dunn's (1954)\"The Location of Agricultural Production\"; Martin J. Beckmann, C.B McGuire, and Clifford B. Winston's (1956) \"Studies in the Economics of Transportation\"; Melvin L. Greenhut's (1956) \"Plant Location in Theory and Practice\"; Gunnar Myrdal's (1957) \"Economic Theory and Underdeveloped Regions\"; Albert O. Hirschman's (1958) \"The Strategy of Economic Development\"; and Claude Ponsard's (1958) \"Histoire des Th\u00e9ories \u00c9conomiques Spatiales\". Nonetheless, Walter Isard's first book in 1956, \"Location and Space Economy\", apparently captured the imagination of many, and his third, \"Methods of Regional Analysis\", published in 1960, only sealed his position as the father of the field.\nAs is typically the case, the above works were built on the shoulders of giants. Much of this predecessor work is documented well in Walter Isard's \"Location and Space Economy\" as well as Claude Ponsard's \"Histoire des Th\u00e9orie \u00c9conomique Spatiales\". Particularly important was the contribution by 19th century German economists to location theory. The early German hegemony more or less starts with Johann Heinrich von Th\u00fcnen and runs through both Wilhelm Launhardt and Alfred Weber to Walter Christaller and August L\u00f6sch.\nCore journals.\nIf an academic discipline is identified by its journals, then technically regional science began in 1955 with the publication of the first volume of the \"Papers and Proceedings, Regional Science Association\" (now \"Papers in Regional Science\" published by Springer). In 1958, the \"Journal of Regional Science\" followed. Since the 1970s, the number of journals serving the field has exploded. The http:// displays most of them.\nMost recently the journal \"Spatial Economic Analysis\" has been published by the RSAI British and Irish Section with the \"Regional Studies Association\". The latter is a separate and growing organisation involving economists, planners, geographers, political scientists, management academics, policymakers, and practitioners.\nAcademic programs.\nWalter Isard's efforts culminated in the creation of a few academic departments and several university-wide programs in regional science. At Walter Isard's suggestion, the University of Pennsylvania started the Regional Science Department in 1956. It featured as its first graduate William Alonso and was looked upon by many to be the international academic leader for the field. Another important graduate and faculty member of the department is Masahisa Fujita. The core curriculum of this department was microeconomics, input-output analysis, location theory, and statistics. Faculty also taught courses in mathematical programming, transportation economics, labor economics, energy and ecological policy modeling, spatial statistics, spatial interaction theory and models, benefit/cost analysis, urban and regional analysis, and economic development theory, among others. But the department's unusual multidisciplinary orientation undoubtedly encouraged its demise, and it lost its department status in 1993.\nWith a few exceptions, such as Cornell University which awards graduate degrees in Regional Science and where Walter Isard had spent the rest of his life after UPENN, most practitioners hold positions in departments such as economics, geography, civil engineering, agricultural economics, rural sociology, urban planning, public policy, or demography. The diversity of disciplines participating in regional science have helped make it one of the most interesting and fruitful fields of academic specialization, but it has also made it difficult to fit the many perspectives into a curriculum for an academic major. It is even difficult for authors to write regional science textbooks, since what is elementary knowledge for one discipline might be entirely novel for another.\nPublic policy impact.\nPart of the movement was, and continues to be, associated with the political and economic realities of the role of the local community. On any occasion where public policy is directed at the sub-national level, such as a city or group of counties, the methods of regional science can prove useful. Traditionally, regional science has provided policymakers with guidance on the following issues:\n*Determinants of industrial location (both within the nation and region)\n*Regional economic impact of the arrival or departure of a firm\n*Determinants and patterns of intra-national and inter-national trade(commodity) and migration(people) flows\n*Regional specialization and exchange\n*Environmental impacts of social and economic change\n*Geographic association of economic and social conditions\nBy targeting federal resources to specific geographic areas the Kennedy administration realized that political favors could be bought. This is also evident in Europe and other places where local economic areas do not coincide with political boundaries. In the more current era of devolution knowledge about \"local solutions to local problems\" has driven much of the interest in regional science. Thus, there has been much political impetus to the growth of the discipline.\nDevelopments after 1980.\nRegional science has enjoyed mixed fortunes since the 1980s. While it has gained a larger following among economists and public policy practitioners, the discipline has fallen out of favor among more radical and post-modernist geographers. In an apparent effort to secure a larger share of research funds, geographers had the National Science Foundation's Geography and Regional Science Program renamed \"Geography and Spatial Sciences\".\nNew economic geography.\nIn 1991, Paul Krugman, as a highly regarded international trade theorist, put out a call for economists to pay more attention to economic geography in a book entitled \"Geography and Trade\", focusing largely on the core regional science concept of agglomeration economies. Krugman's call renewed interest by economists in regional science and, perhaps more importantly, founded what some term the \"new economic geography\", which enjoys much common ground with regional science. Broadly trained \"new economic geographers\" combine quantitative work with other research techniques, for example at the London School of Economics. The unification of Europe and the increased internationalization of the world's economic, social, and political realms has further induced interest in the study of regional, as opposed to national, phenomena. The new economic geography appears to have garnered more interest in Europe than in America where amenities, notably climate, have been found to better predict human location and re-location patterns, as emphasized in recent work by Mark Partridge. In 2008 Krugman won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences and his Prize Lecture has references both to work in regional science's location theory as well as economic's trade theory.\nCriticisms.\nToday there are dwindling numbers of regional scientists from academic planning programs and mainstream geography departments. Attacks on regional science's practitioners by radical critics began as early as the 1970s, notably David Harvey who believed it lacked social and political commitment. Regional science's founder, Walter Isard, never envisioned regional scientists would be political or planning activists. In fact, he suggested that they will seek to be sitting in front of a computer and surrounded by research assistants. Trevor J. Barnes suggests the decline of regional science practice among planners and geographers in North America could have been avoided. He says \"It is unreflective, and consequently inured to change, because of a commitment to a God\u2019s eye view. It is so convinced of its own rightness, of its Archimedean position, that it remained aloof and invariant, rather than being sensitive to its changing local context.\"\nHowever, such critics have failed to provide empirical evidence for their claims and ended up criticizing for the sake of criticizing.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"new economic geography\" by Anthony J.

Most members of both families live in freshwater, and form an important component of the algal scum that grows on or near plants and rocks.\nSystematically they fall within the division Charophyta/Streptophyta, in which the land plants (Embryophyta) emerged.\nSexual reproduction in Zygnematales takes place through a process called \"conjugation\". Here filaments of opposite gender line up, and tubes form between corresponding cells. The male cells then become amoeboid and crawl across, or sometimes both cells crawl into the tube. The cells then meet and fuse to form a zygote, which later undergoes meiosis to produce new filaments. As in plants, only the female passes chloroplasts on to the offspring.\nOther conjugating algae are the Mesotaeniaceae, sister of the Zygnematales, and \"Spirotaenia\", a basal green algae. Additionally, the Desmidiales appear to have emerged deep within the Zygnematales, and are also conjugating.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1930, he became the first author from the United States (and the first from the Americas) to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, which was awarded \"for his vigorous and graphic art of description and his ability to create, with wit and humor, new types of characters.\" Lewis wrote six popular novels: \"Main Street\" (1920), \"Babbitt\" (1922), \"Arrowsmith\" (1925), \"Elmer Gantry\" (1927), \"Dodsworth\" (1929), and \"It Can't Happen Here\" (1935).\nSeveral of his notable works were critical of American capitalism and materialism during the interwar period. Lewis is respected for his strong characterizations of modern working women. H. L. Mencken wrote of him, \"[If] there was ever a novelist among us with an authentic call to the trade ... it is this red-haired tornado from the Minnesota wilds.\"\nEarly life.\nLewis was born February 7, 1885, in the village of Sauk Centre, Minnesota, to Edwin J. Lewis, a physician of Welsh descent, and Emma Kermott Lewis. He had two older siblings, Fred (born 1875) and Claude (born 1878). His father was a stern disciplinarian, who had difficulty relating to his sensitive, unathletic third son. Lewis's mother died in 1891. The next year Edwin married Isabel Warner, whom young Lewis apparently liked. Lewis began reading books while young, and kept a diary. Throughout his lonely boyhood, the ungainly child\u2014tall, extremely thin, stricken with acne and somewhat pop-eyed\u2014had trouble making friends and pined after local girls. At the age of 13, he ran away from home and unsuccessfully tried to become a drummer boy in the Spanish\u2013American War. In late 1902, Lewis left home for a year at Oberlin Academy (the then-preparatory department of Oberlin College) to qualify for acceptance at Yale University. While at Oberlin, he developed a religious enthusiasm that waxed and waned for much of his remaining teenage years. Lewis later became an atheist. He entered Yale in 1903, but did not receive his bachelor's degree until 1908, taking time off to work at Helicon Home Colony, Upton Sinclair's cooperative-living colony in Englewood, New Jersey, and to travel to Panama. Lewis's undistinguished looks, country manners and seeming self-importance made it difficult for him to win and keep friends at Oberlin and Yale. He did make a few friends among the students and professors, some of whom recognized his promise as a writer.\nCareer.\nLewis's earliest published creative work\u2014romantic poetry and short sketches\u2014appeared in the \"Yale Courant\" and the \"Yale Literary Magazine\", of which he became an editor. After graduation Lewis moved from job to job and from place to place in an effort to make ends meet, writing fiction for publication and to chase away boredom. In the summer of 1908, Lewis worked as an editorial writer at a newspaper in Waterloo, Iowa. In September of that year, he moved to the Carmel-by-the-Sea writers' colony near Monterey, California to work for the MacGowan sisters and to meet poet George Sterling in person. He left Carmel after six months, moving to San Francisco where Sterling helped him get a job at the \"San Francisco Evening Bulletin.\" Lewis returned to Carmel in spring 1910 and met Jack London.\nIn fall 1910, Lewis moved to New York to work for Frederick A. Stokes. The next year, he joined the New York chapter of the Socialist Party of America. Among his colleagues in the intellectual wing of the party were Walter Lippmann, William English Walling, Ernest Poole, and John Sloan.\nWhile working for newspapers and publishing houses he developed a facility for turning out shallow, popular stories that were purchased by a variety of magazines. He also earned money by selling plots to London, including one for the latter's unfinished novel \"The Assassination Bureau, Ltd\".\nLewis's first published book was \"Hike and the Aeroplane\", a Tom Swift-style potboiler that appeared in 1912 under the pseudonym Tom Graham.\nSinclair Lewis's first serious novel, \"Our Mr. Wrenn: The Romantic Adventures of a Gentle Man\", appeared in 1914, followed by \"The Trail of the Hawk: A Comedy of the Seriousness of Life\" (1915) and \"The Job\" (1917). That same year also saw the publication of another potboiler, \"\", an expanded version of a serial story that had originally appeared in \"Woman's Home Companion\". \"Free Air\", another refurbished serial story, was published in 1919.\nCommercial success.\nUpon moving to Washington, D.C., Lewis devoted himself to writing. As early as 1916, he began taking notes for a realistic novel about small-town life. Work on that novel continued through mid-1920, when he completed \"Main Street\", which was published on October 23, 1920. His biographer Mark Schorer wrote in 1961 that the phenomenal success of \"Main Street\" \"was the most sensational event in twentieth-century American publishing history\". Lewis's agent had the most optimistic projection of sales at 25,000 copies. In its first six months, \"Main Street\" sold 180,000 copies, and within a few years, sales were estimated at two million. Richard Lingeman wrote in 2002, \"\"Main Street\" made [Lewis] rich\u2014earning him about 3 million current dollars\" (almost $5 million, as of 2022).\nLewis followed up this first great success with \"Babbitt\" (1922), a novel that satirized the American commercial culture and boosterism. The story was set in the fictional Midwestern town of Zenith, Winnemac, a setting to which Lewis returned in future novels, including \"Arrowsmith, Elmer Gantry\", \"Gideon Planish\" and \"Dodsworth\".\nLewis continued his success in the 1920s with \"Arrowsmith\" (1925), a novel about the challenges faced by an idealistic doctor. It was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, which Lewis declined, still upset that \"Main Street\" had not won the prize. It was adapted as a 1931 Hollywood film directed by John Ford and starring Ronald Colman which was nominated for four Academy Awards.\nNext Lewis published \"Elmer Gantry\" (1927), which depicted an evangelical minister as deeply hypocritical. The novel was denounced by many religious leaders and banned in some U.S. cities. It was adapted for the screen more than a generation later as the basis of the 1960 movie starring Burt Lancaster, who earned a Best Actor Oscar for his performance in the title role. The film won two more awards as well.\nLewis next published \"Dodsworth\" (1929), a novel about the most affluent and successful members of American society. He portrayed them as leading essentially pointless lives in spite of great wealth and advantages. The book was adapted for the Broadway stage in 1934 by Sidney Howard, who also wrote the screenplay for the 1936 film version directed by William Wyler, which was a great success at the time. The film is still highly regarded; in 1990, it was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry, and in 2005 \"Time\" magazine named it one of the \"100 Best Movies\" of the past 80 years.\nDuring the late 1920s and 1930s, Lewis wrote many short stories for a variety of magazines and publications. \"Little Bear Bongo\" (1930) is a tale about a bear cub who wants to escape the circus in search of a better life in the real world, first published in \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine. The story was acquired by Walt Disney Pictures in 1940 for a possible feature film. World War II sidetracked those plans until 1947. Disney used the story (now titled \"Bongo\") as part of its feature \"Fun and Fancy Free\".\nNobel Prize.\nIn 1930 Lewis won the Nobel Prize in Literature, the first writer from the United States to receive the award, after he had been nominated by Henrik Sch\u00fcck, member of the Swedish Academy. In the academy's presentation speech, special attention was paid to \"Babbitt\". In his Nobel Lecture, Lewis praised Theodore Dreiser, Willa Cather, Ernest Hemingway, and other contemporaries, but also lamented that \"in America most of us\u2014not readers alone, but even writers\u2014are still afraid of any literature which is not a glorification of everything American, a glorification of our faults as well as our virtues,\" and that America is \"the most contradictory, the most depressing, the most stirring, of any land in the world today.\" He also offered a profound criticism of the American literary establishment: \"Our American professors like their literature clear and cold and pure and very dead.\"\nLater years.\n \nAfter winning the Nobel Prize, Lewis wrote eleven more novels, ten of which appeared in his lifetime. The best remembered is \"It Can't Happen Here\" (1935), a novel about the election of a fascist to the American presidency.\nAfter praising Dreiser as \"pioneering\", that he \"more than any other man, marching alone, usually unappreciated, often hated, has cleared the trail from Victorian and Howellsian timidity and gentility in American fiction to honesty and boldness and passion of life\" in his Nobel Lecture in December 1930, in March 1931 Lewis publicly accused Dreiser of plagiarizing a book by Dorothy Thompson, Lewis's wife, which led to a well-publicized fight, wherein Dreiser repeatedly slapped Lewis. Thompson initially made the accusation in 1928 regarding her work \"The New Russia\" and Dreiser's \"Dreiser Goes to Russia\", though \"The New York Times\" also linked the dispute to competition between Dreiser and Lewis over the Nobel Prize. Dreiser fired back that Sinclair's 1925 novel \"Arrowsmith\" (adapted later that year as a feature film) was unoriginal and that Dreiser himself was first approached to write it, which was disputed by the wife of \"Arrowsmith\"'s subject, microbiologist Dr. Paul de Kruif. The feud carried on for some months. In 1944, Lewis campaigned to have Dreiser recognized by the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\nAfter an alcoholic binge in 1937, Lewis checked in for treatment to the Austen Riggs Center, a psychiatric hospital in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. His doctors gave him a blunt assessment that he needed to decide \"whether he was going to live without alcohol or die by it, one or the other.\" Lewis checked out after ten days, lacking any \"fundamental understanding of his problem\", as one of his physicians wrote to a colleague.\nIn the autumn of 1940, Lewis visited his old acquaintance, William Ellery Leonard, in Madison, Wisconsin. Leonard arranged a meeting with the chancellor of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison and a tour of the campus. Lewis immediately became enthralled with the university and the city and offered to remain and teach a course in creative writing in the upcoming semester. For a month he was quite enamored of his professorial role. Suddenly, on November 7, after giving only five classes to his select group of 24 students, he announced that he had taught them all that he knew. He left Madison the next day.\nIn the 1940s, Lewis and rabbi-turned-popular-author Lewis Browne frequently appeared on the lecture platform together, touring the United States and debating before audiences of as many as 3,000 people, addressing such questions as \"Has the Modern Woman Made Good?\", \"The Country Versus the City\", \"Is the Machine Age Wrecking Civilization?\", and \"Can Fascism Happen Here?\". The pair were described as \"the Gallagher and Shean of the lecture circuit\" by Lewis biographer Richard Lingeman.\nIn the early 1940s, Lewis lived in Duluth, Minnesota. During this time, he wrote the novel \"Kingsblood Royal\" (1947), set in the fictional city of Grand Republic, Minnesota, an enlarged and updated version of Zenith. It is based on the Sweet Trials in Detroit in which an African-American doctor was denied the chance to purchase a house in a \"white\" section of the city. Lewis' creation of the novel was preceded by his introduction to the black community via Edward Francis Murphy, a Josephite priest with whom he had attended school as a child. \"Kingsblood\" was a powerful and very early contribution to the civil rights movement.\nIn 1943, Lewis went to Hollywood to work on a script with Dore Schary, who had just resigned as executive head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's low-budget film department to concentrate on writing and producing his own films. The resulting screenplay was \"Storm In the West\", \"a traditional American western\" \u2014 except for the fact that it was also an allegory of World War II, with primary villain Hygatt (Hitler) and his henchmen Gribbles (Goebbels) and Gerrett (Goering) plotting to take over the Franson Ranch, the Poling Ranch, and so on. The screenplay was deemed too political by MGM studio executives and was shelved, and the film was never made. \"Storm In the West\" was finally published in 1963, with a foreword by Schary detailing the work's origins, the authors' creative process, and the screenplay's ultimate fate.\nSinclair Lewis had been a frequent visitor to Williamstown, Massachusetts. In 1946, he rented Thorvale Farm on Oblong Road. While working on his novel \"Kingsblood Royal\", he purchased this summer estate and upgraded the Georgian mansion along with a farmhouse and many outbuildings. By 1948, Lewis had created a gentleman's farm consisting of of agricultural and forest land. His intended residence in Williamstown was short-lived because of his medical problems.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1914 Lewis married Grace Livingston Hegger (1887\u20131981), an editor at \"Vogue\" magazine. They had one son, Wells Lewis (1917\u20131944), named after British author H. G. Wells. Serving as a U.S. Army lieutenant during World War II, Wells Lewis was killed in action on October 29, 1944 amid Allied efforts to rescue the \"Lost Battalion\" in France. Dean Acheson, the future Secretary of State, was a neighbor and family friend in Washington, and observed that Sinclair's literary \"success was not good for that marriage, or for either of the parties to it, or for Lewis's work\" and the family moved out of town.\nLewis divorced Grace on April 16, 1928. On May 14, he married the noted international correspondant and newspaper columnist Dorothy Thompson. In 1928, he and Dorothy purchased a second home in rural Vermont. They had a son, Michael Lewis (1930\u20131975), who became a stage actor. Their marriage had virtually ended by 1937, and they divorced in 1942.\nLewis died in Rome from advanced alcoholism, on January 10, 1951, aged 65. His body was cremated and his remains were buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Sauk Centre, Minnesota. His final novel \"World So Wide\" (1951) was published posthumously.\nWilliam Shirer, a friend and admirer of Lewis, argued that Lewis did not die from alcoholism. He reported that Lewis had a heart attack and that his doctors advised him to stop drinking if he wanted to live. Lewis did not stop, and perhaps could not; he died when his heart stopped.\nIn summarizing Lewis's career, Shirer said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It has become rather commonplace for so-called literary critics to write off Sinclair Lewis as a novelist. Compared to\u00a0... Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Dos Passos, and Faulkner\u00a0... Lewis lacked style. Yet his impact on modern American life\u00a0... was greater than all of the other four writers together.\nLegacy.\nCompared to his contemporaries, Lewis's reputation suffered a precipitous decline among literary scholars throughout the 20th century. Despite his enormous popularity during the 1920s, by the 21st century most of his works had been eclipsed in prominence by other writers with less commercial success during the same time period, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.\nSince the 2010s there has been renewed interest in Lewis's work, in particular his 1935 dystopian satire \"It Can't Happen Here\". In the aftermath of the 2016 United States presidential election, \"It Can't Happen Here\" surged to the top of Amazon's list of best-selling books. Scholars have found parallels in his novels to the COVID-19 crisis, and to the rise of Donald Trump.\nHe has been honored by the U.S. Postal Service with a postage stamp in the Great Americans series. In 1960 Polish American sculptor Joseph Kiselewski was commissioned to create a bust of Lewis, now in the Great River Regional public library in Sauk Centre.\nWorks.\nNovels.\n\"Babbitt, Mantrap\" and \"Cass Timberlane\" were published as Armed Services Editions during WWII.\nShort stories.\n\"The Short Stories of Sinclair Lewis (1904\u20131949)\".\nSamuel J.

Those who conduct acts of piracy are called pirates, and vessels used for piracy are called pirate ships. The earliest documented instances of piracy were in the 14th century BC, when the Sea Peoples, a group of ocean raiders, attacked the ships of the Aegean and Mediterranean civilisations. Narrow channels which funnel shipping into predictable routes have long created opportunities for piracy, as well as for privateering and commerce raiding.\nHistoric examples of such areas include the waters of Gibraltar, the Strait of Malacca, Madagascar, the Gulf of Aden, and the English Channel, whose geographic structures facilitated pirate attacks. The term \"piracy\" generally refers to maritime piracy, although the term has been generalized to refer to acts committed on land, in the air, on computer networks, and (in science fiction) outer space. Piracy usually excludes crimes committed by the perpetrator on their own vessel (e.g. theft), as well as privateering, which implies authorization by a state government.\nPiracy or pirating is the name of a specific crime under customary international law and also the name of a number of crimes under the municipal law of a number of states. In the 21st century, seaborne piracy against transport vessels remains a significant issue, with estimated worldwide losses of US$25\u00a0billion in 2023, increased from US$16\u00a0billion in 2004.\nThe waters between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, off the Somali coast and in the Strait of Malacca and Singapore have frequently been targeted by modern pirates armed with automatic firearms and occasionally explosive weaponry. They often use small motorboats to attack and board ships, a tactic that takes advantage of the small number of crew members on modern cargo vessels and transport ships. The international community is facing many challenges in bringing modern pirates to justice, as these attacks often occur in international waters. Nations have used their naval forces to repel and pursue pirates, and some private vessels use armed security guards, high-pressure water cannons, or sound cannons to repel boarders, and use radar to avoid potential threats.\nRomanticised accounts of piracy during the Age of Sail have long been a part of Western pop culture. The two-volume \"A General History of the Pyrates\", published in London in 1724, is generally credited with bringing key piratical figures and a semi-accurate description of their milieu in the \"Golden Age of Piracy\" to the public's imagination. \"A General History\" inspired and informed many later fictional depictions of piracy, most notably the novels \"Treasure Island\" (1883) and \"Peter Pan\" (1911), both of which have been adapted and readapted for stage, film, television, and other media across over a century. More recently, pirates of the \"golden age\" were further stereotyped and popularized by the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" film franchise, which began in 2003.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nThe English word \"pirate\" is derived from the Latin \"pirata\" (\"pirate, corsair, sea robber\"), which comes from Greek \u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 (\"peirat\u0113s\"), \"brigand\", from \u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03ac\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 (peir\u00e1omai), \"I attempt\", from \u03c0\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1 (\"pe\u00eera\"), \"attempt, experience\". The meaning of the Greek word \"peirat\u0113s\" literally is \"anyone who attempts something\". Over time it came to be used of anyone who engaged in robbery or brigandry on land or sea. The term first appeared in English c. 1300. Spelling did not become standardised until the eighteenth century, and spellings such as \"pirrot\", \"pyrate\" and \"pyrat\" occurred until this period.\nHistory.\nEurope.\nAntiquity.\nThe earliest documented instances of piracy are the exploits of the Sea Peoples who threatened the ships sailing in the Aegean and Mediterranean waters in the 14th century BC. In classical antiquity, the Phoenicians, Illyrians and Tyrrhenians were known as pirates. In the pre-classical era, the ancient Greeks condoned piracy as a viable profession; it apparently was widespread and \"regarded as an entirely honourable way of making a living\". References are made to its perfectly normal occurrence in many texts including in Homer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\", and abduction of women and children to be sold into slavery was common. By the era of Classical Greece, piracy was looked upon as a \"disgrace\" to have as a profession.\nIn the 3rd century BC, pirate attacks on Olympus in Lycia brought impoverishment. Among some of the most famous ancient pirateering peoples were the Illyrians, a people populating the western Balkan peninsula. Constantly raiding the Adriatic Sea, the Illyrians caused many conflicts with the Roman Republic. It was not until 229 BC when the Romans decisively beat the Illyrian fleets that their threat was ended. During the 1st century BC, there were pirate states along the Anatolian coast, threatening the commerce of the Roman Empire in the eastern Mediterranean. On one voyage across the Aegean Sea in 75\u00a0BC, Julius Caesar was kidnapped and briefly held by Cilician pirates and held prisoner in the Dodecanese islet of Pharmacusa. The Senate invested the general Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus with powers to deal with piracy in 67\u00a0BC (the \"Lex Gabinia\"), and Pompey, after three months of naval warfare, managed to suppress the threat.\nAs early as 258\u00a0AD, the Gothic-Herulic fleet ravaged towns on the coasts of the Black Sea and Sea of Marmara. The Aegean coast suffered similar attacks a few years later. In 264, the Goths reached Galatia and Cappadocia, and Gothic pirates landed on Cyprus and Crete. In the process, the Goths seized enormous booty and took thousands into captivity. In 286\u00a0AD, Carausius, a Roman military commander of Gaulish origins, was appointed to command the \"Classis Britannica\", and given the responsibility of eliminating Frankish and Saxon pirates who had been raiding the coasts of Armorica and Belgic Gaul. In the Roman province of Britannia, Saint Patrick was captured and enslaved by Irish pirates.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe most widely recognized and far-reaching pirates in medieval Europe were the Vikings, seaborne warriors from Scandinavia who raided and looted mainly between the 8th and 12th centuries, during the Viking Age in the Early Middle Ages. They raided the coasts, rivers and inland cities of all Western Europe as far as Seville, which was attacked by the Norse in 844. Vikings also attacked the coasts of North Africa and Italy and plundered all the coasts of the Baltic Sea. Some Vikings ascended the rivers of Eastern Europe as far as the Black Sea and Persia.\nIn the Late Middle Ages, the Frisian pirates known as Arumer Zwarte Hoop led by Pier Gerlofs Donia and Wijerd Jelckama, fought against the troops of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V with some success.\nToward the end of the 9th century, Moorish pirate havens were established along the coast of southern France and northern Italy. In 846 Moor raiders sacked the \"extra muros\" Basilicas of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in Rome. In 911, the bishop of Narbonne was unable to return to France from Rome because the Moors from Fraxinet controlled all the passes in the Alps. Moor pirates operated out of the Balearic Islands in the 10th century. From 824 to 961 Arab pirates in the Emirate of Crete raided the entire Mediterranean. In the 14th century, raids by Moor pirates forced the Venetian Duke of Crete to ask Venice to keep its fleet on constant guard.\nAfter the Slavic invasions of the former Roman province of Dalmatia in the 5th and 6th centuries, a tribe called the Narentines revived the old Illyrian piratical habits and often raided the Adriatic Sea starting in the 7th century. Their raids in the Adriatic increased rapidly, until the whole Sea was no longer safe for travel.\nThe Narentines took more liberties in their raiding quests while the Venetian Navy was abroad, as when it was campaigning in Sicilian waters in 827\u2013882. As soon as the Venetian fleet would return to the Adriatic, the Narentines momentarily outcast their habits again, even signing a Treaty in Venice and baptising their Slavic pagan leader into Christianity. In 834 or 835 they broke the treaty and again they raided Venetian traders returning from Benevento. All of Venice's military attempts to punish them in 839 and 840 utterly failed.\nLater, they raided the Venetians more often, together with the Arabs. In 846, the Narentines broke through to Venice itself and raided its lagoon city of Caorle. This caused a Byzantine military action against them that brought Christianity to them. After the Arab raids on the Adriatic coast circa 872 and the retreat of the Imperial Navy, the Narentines continued their raids of Venetian waters, causing new conflicts with the Italians in 887\u2013888. The Venetians futilely continued to fight them throughout the 10th and 11th centuries.\nDomagoj was accused of attacking a ship which was bringing home the papal legates who had participated in the Eighth Catholic Ecumenical Council, after which Pope John VIII addresses to Domagoj with request that his pirates stop attacking Christians at sea.\nIn 937, Irish pirates sided with the Scots, Vikings, Picts, and Welsh in their invasion of England. Athelstan drove them back.\nThe Slavic piracy in the Baltic Sea ended with the Danish conquest of the Rani stronghold of Arkona in 1168. In the 12th century the coasts of western Scandinavia were plundered by Curonians and Oeselians from the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea. In the 13th and 14th century, pirates threatened the Hanseatic routes and nearly brought sea trade to the brink of extinction. The Victual Brothers of Gotland were a companionship of privateers who later turned to piracy as the Likedeelers. They were especially noted for their leaders Klaus St\u00f6rtebeker and G\u00f6deke Michels. Until about 1440, maritime trade in both the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Bothnia was seriously in danger of attack by the pirates.\nH. Thomas Milhorn mentions a certain Englishman named William Maurice, convicted of piracy in 1241, as the first person known to have been hanged, drawn and quartered, which would indicate that the then-ruling King Henry III took an especially severe view of this crime.\nThe ushkuiniks were Novgorodian pirates who looted the cities on the Volga and Kama Rivers in the 14th century.\nAs early as Byzantine times, the Maniots (one of Greece's toughest populations) were known as pirates. The Maniots considered piracy as a legitimate response to the fact that their land was poor and it became their main source of income. The main victims of Maniot pirates were the Ottomans but the Maniots also targeted ships of European countries.\nZaporizhian Sich was a pirate republic in Europe from the 16th through to the 18th century. Situated in Cossack territory in the remote steppe of Eastern Europe, it was populated with Ukrainian peasants that had run away from their feudal masters, outlaws, destitute gentry, run-away slaves from Turkish galleys, etc. The remoteness of the place and the rapids at the Dnieper river effectively guarded the place from invasions of vengeful powers.\nThe main target of the inhabitants of the Zaporizhian Sich who called themselves \"Cossacks\", were rich settlements at the Black Sea shores of Ottoman Empire and Crimean Khanate. By 1615 and 1625, Zaporozhian Cossacks had even managed to raze townships on the outskirts of Istanbul, forcing the Ottoman Sultan to flee his palace. Don Cossacks under Stenka Razin even ravaged the Persian coasts.\nMediterranean corsairs.\nThough less famous and romanticized than Atlantic or Caribbean pirates, corsairs in the Mediterranean equaled or outnumbered the former at any given point in history. Mediterranean piracy was conducted almost entirely with galleys until the mid-17th century, when they were gradually replaced with highly maneuverable sailing vessels such as xebecs and brigantines. They were of a smaller type than battle galleys, often referred to as galiots or fustas.\nPirate galleys were small, nimble, lightly armed, but often crewed in large numbers in order to overwhelm the often minimal crews of merchant ships. In general, pirate craft were extremely difficult for patrolling craft to actually hunt down and capture. Anne Hilarion de Tourville, a French admiral of the 17th century, believed that the only way to run down raiders from the infamous corsair Moroccan port of Sal\u00e9 was by using a captured pirate vessel of the same type.\nUsing oared vessels to combat pirates was common, and was even practiced by the major powers in the Caribbean. Purpose-built galleys, or hybrid sailing vessels, were built by the English in Jamaica in 1683 and by the Spanish in the late 16th century. Specially-built sailing frigates with oar-ports on the lower decks, like the \"James Galley\" and \"Charles Galley\", and oar-equipped sloops proved highly useful for pirate hunting, though they were not built in sufficient numbers to check piracy until the 1720s.\nThe expansion of Muslim power through the Ottoman conquest of large parts of the eastern Mediterranean in the 15th and 16th century resulted in extensive piracy on sea trading. The so-called Barbary pirates began to operate out of North African ports in Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, Morocco around 1500, preying primarily on the shipping of Christian powers, including massive slave raids at sea as well as on land. The Barbary pirates were nominally under Ottoman suzerainty, but had considerable independence to prey on the enemies of Islam. The Muslim corsairs were technically often privateers with support from legitimate, though highly belligerent, states. They considered themselves as holy Muslim warriors, or ghazis, carrying on the tradition of fighting the incursion of Western Christians that had begun with the First Crusade late in the 11th century.\nCoastal villages and towns of Italy, Spain and islands in the Mediterranean were frequently attacked by Muslim corsairs, and long stretches of the Italian and Spanish coasts were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants. After 1600, the Barbary corsairs occasionally entered the Atlantic and struck as far north as Iceland. According to Robert Davis between 1\u00a0million and 1.25\u00a0million Europeans were captured by Barbary corsairs and sold as slaves in North Africa and the Ottoman Empire between the 16th and 19th centuries. The most famous corsairs were the Ottoman Albanian Hayreddin and his older brother Oru\u00e7 Reis (Redbeard), Turgut Reis (known as Dragut in the West), Kurtoglu (known as Curtogoli in the West), Kemal Reis, Salih Reis and Koca Murat Reis. A few Barbary corsairs, such as the Dutch Jan Janszoon and the English John Ward (Muslim name Yusuf Reis), were renegade European privateers who had converted to Islam.\nThe Barbary pirates had a direct Christian counterpart in the military order of the Knights of Saint John that operated first out of Rhodes and after 1530 Malta, though they were less numerous and took fewer slaves. Both sides waged war against the respective enemies of their faith, and both used galleys as their primary weapons. Both sides also used captured or bought galley slaves to man the oars of their ships. The Muslims relied mostly on captured Christians, the Christians used a mix of Muslim slaves, Christian convicts and a small contingency of \"buonavoglie\", free men who out of desperation or poverty had taken to rowing.\nHistorian Peter Earle has described the two sides of the Christian-Muslim Mediterranean conflict as \"mirror image[s] of maritime predation, two businesslike fleets of plunderers set against each other\". This conflict of faith in the form of privateering, piracy and slave raiding generated a complex system that was upheld/financed/operated on the trade in plunder and slaves that was generated from a low-intensive conflict, as well as the need for protection from violence. The system has been described as a \"massive, multinational protection racket\", the Christian side of which was not ended until 1798 in the Napoleonic Wars. The Barbary corsairs were quelled as late as the 1830s, effectively ending the last vestiges of counter-crusading jihad.\nPiracy off the Barbary coast was often assisted by competition among European powers in the 17th century. France encouraged the corsairs against Spain, and later Britain and Holland supported them against France. By the second half of the 17th century the greater European naval powers began to initiate reprisals to intimidate the Barbary States into making peace with them. The most successful of the Christian states in dealing with the corsair threat was England. From the 1630s onwards England had signed peace treaties with the Barbary States on various occasions, but invariably breaches of these agreements led to renewed wars.\nAlbanian piracy, mainly centered in the town of Ulcinj (thus came to be known as \"Dulcignotti\"), flourished during the 15th to the 19th century.\nFrance, which had recently emerged as a leading naval power, achieved comparable success soon afterwards, with bombardments of Algiers in 1682, 1683 and 1688 securing a lasting peace, while Tripoli was similarly coerced in 1686. In 1783 and 1784 the Spaniards bombarded Algiers in an effort to stem the piracy. The second time, Admiral Barcel\u00f3 damaged the city so severely that the Algerian Dey asked Spain to negotiate a peace treaty. From then on, Spanish vessels and coasts were safe for several years.\nUntil the American Declaration of Independence in 1776, British treaties with the North African states protected American ships from the Barbary corsairs. Morocco, which in 1777 was the first independent nation to publicly recognize the United States, became in 1784 the first Barbary power to seize an American vessel after independence. While the United States managed to secure peace treaties, these obliged it to pay tribute for protection from attack. Payments in ransom and tribute to the Barbary states amounted to 20% of United States government annual expenditures in 1800, leading to the Barbary Wars that ended the payment of tribute. Algiers broke the 1805 peace treaty after only two years, and refused to implement the 1815 treaty until compelled to do so by Britain in 1816.\nIn 1815, the sacking of Palma on the island of Sardinia by a Tunisian squadron, which carried off 158 inhabitants, roused widespread indignation. Britain had by this time banned the slave trade and was seeking to induce other countries to do likewise. This led to complaints from states which were still vulnerable to the corsairs that Britain's enthusiasm for ending the trade in African slaves did not extend to stopping the enslavement of Europeans and Americans by the Barbary States.\nIn order to neutralise this objection and further the anti-slavery campaign, in 1816 Lord Exmouth was sent to secure new concessions from Tripoli, Tunis, and Algiers, including a pledge to treat Christian captives in any future conflict as prisoners of war rather than slaves and the imposition of peace between Algiers and the kingdoms of Sardinia and Sicily. On his first visit he negotiated satisfactory treaties and sailed for home. While he was negotiating, a number of Sardinian fishermen who had settled at Bona on the Tunisian coast were brutally treated without his knowledge. As Sardinians they were technically under British protection and the government sent Exmouth back to secure reparation. On August 17, in combination with a Dutch squadron under Admiral Van de Capellen, he bombarded Algiers. Both Algiers and Tunis made fresh concessions as a result.\nSecuring uniform compliance with a total prohibition of slave-raiding, which was traditionally of central importance to the North African economy, presented difficulties beyond those faced in ending attacks on ships of individual nations, which had left slavers able to continue their accustomed way of life by preying on less well-protected peoples. Algiers renewed its slave-raiding, though on a smaller scale. Measures to be taken against the city's government were discussed at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818. In 1820, another British fleet under Admiral Sir Harry Neal again bombarded Algiers. Corsair activity based in Algiers did not entirely cease until its conquest by France in 1830.\nSoutheast Asia.\nIn thalassocratic Austronesian cultures in Island Southeast Asia, maritime raids for slaves and resources against rival polities have ancient origins. It was associated with prestige and prowess and often recorded in tattoos. Reciprocal raiding traditions were recorded by early European cultures as being prevalent throughout Island Southeast Asia.\nWith the advent of Islam and the colonial era, slaves became a valuable resource for trading with European, Arab, and Chinese slavers, and the volume of piracy and slave raids increased significantly. Numerous native peoples engaged in sea raiding; they include the Iranun and Balanguingui slavers of Sulu, the Iban headhunters of Borneo, the Bugis sailors of South Sulawesi, and the Malays of western Southeast Asia. Piracy was also practiced by foreign seafarers on a smaller scale, including Chinese, Japanese, and European traders, renegades, and outlaws. The volume of piracy and raids were often dependent on the ebb and flow of trade and monsoons, with pirate season (known colloquially as the \"Pirate Wind\") starting from August to September.\nSlave raids were of high economic importance to the Muslim Sultanates in the Sulu Sea: the Sultanate of Sulu, the Sultanate of Maguindanao, and the Confederation of Sultanates in Lanao (the modern Moro people). It is estimated that from 1770 to 1870, around 200,000 to 300,000 people were enslaved by Iranun and Banguingui slavers. David P. Forsythe put the estimate much higher, at around 2 million slaves captured within the first two centuries of Spanish rule of the Philippines after 1565.\nThese slaves were taken from piracy on passing ships as well as coastal raids on settlements as far as the Malacca Strait, Java, the southern coast of China and the islands beyond the Makassar Strait. Most of the slaves were Tagalogs, Visayans, and \"Malays\" (including Bugis, Mandarese, Iban, and Makassar). There were also occasional European and Chinese captives who were usually ransomed off through Tausug intermediaries of the Sulu Sultanate. Slaves were the primary indicators of wealth and status, and they were the source of labor for the farms, fisheries, and workshops of the sultanates. While personal slaves were rarely sold, they trafficked extensively in slaves purchased from the Iranun and Banguingui slave markets. By the 1850s, slaves constituted 50% or more of the population of the Sulu archipelago.\nThe scale was so massive that the word for \"pirate\" in Malay became \"lanun\", an exonym of the Iranun people. The economy of the Sulu sultanates was largely run by slaves and the slave trade. Male captives of the Iranun and the Banguingui were treated brutally, even fellow Muslim captives were not spared. They were usually forced to serve as galley slaves on the \"lanong\" and \"garay\" warships of their captors. Female captives, however, were usually treated better. There were no recorded accounts of rapes, though some were starved for discipline. Within a year of capture, most of the captives of the Iranun and Banguingui would be bartered off in Jolo usually for rice, opium, bolts of cloth, iron bars, brassware, and weapons. The buyers were usually Tausug \"datu\" from the Sultanate of Sulu who had preferential treatment, but buyers also included European (Dutch and Portuguese) and Chinese traders as well as Visayan pirates (\"renegados\").\nSpanish authorities and native Christian Filipinos responded to the Moro slave raids by building watchtowers and forts across the Philippine archipelago, many of which are still standing today. In Northern Luzon particularly in the Pangasinan, Ilocos and Cagayan, the coastal villages and towns, were frequently raided by Moro and Chinese pirates, locally known as \"t\u00edrong or cumaw\" (raiders, attackers or pirates). These pirates looted and burned villages (\"barrios\") and captured women and children for enslavement. To counter these threats, Spanish authorities constructed circular adobe watchtowers, or \"baluartes\", measuring 6 to 7 meters high. These structures, built strategically along the coastline using coral blocks bonded with a mixture of lime and egg whites, served as both lookout points and defensive fortifications to protect villages from pirate attacks.\nSome provincial capitals were also moved further inland. Major command posts were built in Manila, Cavite, Cebu, Iloilo, Zamboanga, and Iligan. Defending ships were also built by local communities, especially in the Visayas Islands, including the construction of war \"barangayanes\" (\"balangay\") that were faster than the Moro raiders and could give chase. As resistance against raiders increased, \"Lanong\" warships of the Iranun were eventually replaced by the smaller and faster \"garay\" warships of the Banguingui in the early 19th century. The Moro raids were eventually subdued by several major naval expeditions by the Spanish and local forces from 1848 to 1891, including retaliatory bombardment and capture of Moro settlements. By this time, the Spanish had also acquired steam gunboats (\"vapor\"), which could easily overtake and destroy the native Moro warships.\nSeveral famous pirates, such as \"Intjeh Cohdja\" and \"Wassingrana\", were hunted by the VOC for hijacking their merchant ships in the Eastern salient of Java. \nAside from the Iranun and Banguingui pirates, other polities were also associated with maritime raiding. The Bugis sailors of South Sulawesi were infamous as pirates who used to range as far west as Singapore and as far north as the Philippines in search of targets for piracy. The Orang laut pirates controlled shipping in the Straits of Malacca and the waters around Singapore, and the Malay and Sea Dayak pirates preyed on maritime shipping in the waters between Singapore and Hong Kong from their haven in Borneo.\nEast Asia.\nIn East Asia by the ninth century, populations centered mostly around merchant activities in coastal Shandong and Jiangsu. Wealthy benefactors including Chang Pogo established Silla Buddhist temples in the region. Chang Pogo had become incensed at the treatment of his fellow countrymen, who in the unstable milieu of late Tang often fell victim to coastal pirates or inland bandits. After returning to Silla around 825, and in possession of a formidable private fleet headquartered at Cheonghae (Wando), Chang Pogo petitioned the Silla king Heungdeok (r.\u2009826\u00a0\u2013\u00a0836) to establish a permanent maritime garrison to protect Silla merchant activities in the Yellow Sea. Heungdeok agreed and in 828 formally established the Cheonghae (, \"clear sea\") Garrison () at what is today Wando island off Korea's South Jeolla province. Heungdeok gave Chang an army of 10,000 men to establish and man the defensive works. The remnants of Cheonghae Garrison can still be seen on Jang islet just off Wando's southern coast. Chang's force, though nominally bequeathed by the Silla king, was effectively under his own control. Chang became arbiter of Yellow Sea commerce and navigation.\nFrom the 13th century, Wokou based in Japan made their debut in East Asia, initiating invasions that would persist for 300 years. The wokou raids peaked in the 1550s, but by then the wokou were mostly Chinese smugglers who reacted strongly against the Ming dynasty's strict prohibition on private sea trade.\nDuring the Qing period, Chinese pirate fleets grew increasingly large. The effects large-scale piracy had on the Chinese economy were immense. They preyed voraciously on China's junk trade, which flourished in Fujian and Guangdong and was a vital artery of Chinese commerce. Pirate fleets exercised hegemony over villages on the coast, collecting revenue by exacting tribute and running extortion rackets. In 1802, the menacing Zheng Yi inherited the fleet of his cousin, captain Zheng Qi, whose death provided Zheng Yi with considerably more influence in the world of piracy. Zheng Yi and his wife, Zheng Yi Sao (who would eventually inherit the leadership of his pirate confederacy) then formed a pirate coalition that, by 1804, consisted of over ten thousand men. Their military might alone was sufficient to combat the Qing navy. However, a combination of famine, Qing naval opposition, and internal rifts crippled piracy in China around the 1820s, and it has never again reached the same status.\nIn the 1840s and 1850s, United States Navy and Royal Navy forces campaigned together against Chinese pirates. Major battles were fought such as those at Ty-ho Bay and the Tonkin River though pirate junks continued operating off China for years more. However, some British and American individual citizens also volunteered to serve with Chinese pirates to fight against European forces. The British offered rewards for the capture of westerners serving with Chinese pirates. During the Second Opium War and the Taiping Rebellion, piratical junks were again destroyed in large numbers by British naval forces but ultimately it was not until the 1860s and 1870s that fleets of pirate junks ceased to exist.\nChinese Pirates also plagued the Tonkin Gulf area.\nPiracy in the Ming dynasty.\nPirates in the Ming era tended to come from populations on the geographic periphery of the state. They were recruited largely from the lower classes of society, including poor fishermen, and many were fleeing from obligatory labor on state-building projects organized by the dynasty. These lower-class men, and sometimes women, may have fled taxation or conscription by the state in the search of better opportunities and wealth, and willingly joined local pirate bands. These local, lower class individuals seem to have felt unrepresented, and traded the small amount of security afforded them from their allegiance to the state for the promise of a relatively improved existence engaging in smuggling or other illegal trade.\nOriginally, pirates in the coastal areas near Fujian and Zhejiang may have been Japanese, suggested by the Ming government referring to them as \"\"wokou\" (\u502d\u5bc7)\", but it is probable that piracy was a multi-ethnic profession by the 16th century, although coastal brigands continued to be referred to as \"wokou\" in many government documents. Most pirates were probably Han Chinese, but Japanese and even Europeans engaged in pirate activities in the region.\nIllegal trade and authority.\nPirates engaged in a number of different schemes to make a living. Smuggling and illegal trade overseas were major sources of revenue for pirate bands, both large and small. As the Ming government mostly outlawed private trade overseas, at least until the overseas silver trade contributed to a lifting of the ban, pirates basically could almost by default control the market for any number of foreign goods. The geography of the coastline made chasing pirates quite difficult for the authorities, and private overseas trade began to transform coastal societies by the 15th century, as nearly all aspects of the local society benefitted from or associated with illegal trade. The desire to trade for silver eventually led to open conflict between the Ming and illegal smugglers and pirates. This conflict, along with local merchants in southern China, helped persuade the Ming court to end the haijin ban on private international trade in 1567.\nPirates also projected local political authority. Larger pirate bands could act as local governing bodies for coastal communities, collecting taxes and engaging in \"protection\" schemes. In addition to illegal goods, pirates ostensibly offered security to communities on land in exchange for a tax. These bands also wrote and codified laws that redistributed wealth, punished crimes, and provided protection for the taxed community. These laws were strictly followed by the pirates, as well. The political structures tended to look similar to the Ming structures.\nHierarchy and structure.\nPirates did not tend to stay pirates permanently. It seems to have been relatively easy both to join and leave a pirate band, and these raiding groups were more interested in maintaining a willing force. Members of these pirate groups did not tend to stay longer than a few months or years at a time.\nThere appears to have been a hierarchy in most pirate organizations. Pirate leaders could become very wealthy and powerful, especially when working with the Chinese dynasty, and, consequently, so could those who served under them. These pirate groups were organized similarly to other \"escape societies\" throughout history, and maintained a redistributive system to reward looting; the pirates directly responsible for looting or pillaging got their cut first, and the rest was allocated to the rest of the pirate community. There seems to be evidence that there was an egalitarian aspect to these communities, with capability to do the job being rewarded explicitly. The pirates themselves had some special privileges under the law when they interacted with communities on land, mostly in the form of extra allotments of redistributed wealth.\nClientele.\nPirates, of course, had to sell their loot. They had trading relationships with land communities and foreign traders in the southeastern regions of China. Zhu Wan, who held the office of Grand Coordinator for Coastal Defense, documented that pirates in the region to which he had been sent had the support of the local elite gentry class. These \"pirates in gowns and caps\" directly or indirectly sponsored pirate activity and certainly directly benefitted from the illegal private trade in the region. When Zhu Wan or other officials from the capital attempted to eliminate the pirate problem, these local elites fought back, having Zhu Wan demoted and eventually even sent back to Beijing to possibly be executed. The gentry who benefitted from illegal maritime trade were too powerful and influential, and they were clearly very invested in the smuggling activities of the pirate community.\nIn addition to their relationship with the local elite class on the coast, pirates also had complicated and often friendly relationships and partnerships with the dynasty itself, as well as with international traders. When pirate groups recognized the authority of the dynasty, they would often be allowed to operate freely and even profit from the relationship. There were also opportunities for these pirates to ally themselves with colonial projects from Europe or other overseas powers. Both the dynasty and foreign colonial projects would employ pirates as mercenaries to establish dominance in the coastal region. Because of how difficult it was for established state powers to control these regions, pirates seem to have had a lot of freedom to choose their allies and their preferred markets. Included in this list of possible allies, sea marauders and pirates even found opportunities to bribe military officials as they engaged in illegal trade. They seem to have been incentivized mostly by money and loot, and so could afford to play the field with regards to their political or military allies.\nBecause pirate organizations could be so powerful locally, the Ming government made concerted efforts to weaken them. The presence of colonial projects complicated this, however, as pirates could ally themselves with other maritime powers or local elites to stay in business. The Chinese government was clearly aware of the power of some of these pirate groups, as some documents even refer to them as \"sea rebels,\" a reference to the political nature of pirates. Pirates like Zheng Zhilong and Zheng Chenggong accrued tremendous local power, eventually even being hired as naval commanders by the Chinese dynasties and foreign maritime powers.\nSouth Asia.\nBawarij were Sindhi pirates named for their distinctive barja warships who were active between 251 and 865 AD. Their frequent piracy and the incident in which they looted two treasure ships coming from Ceylon became the casus belli for the Umayyad conquest of Sindh.\nPirates who accepted the Royal Pardon from the Chola Empire would get to serve in the Chola Navy as \"Kallarani\". They would be used as coast guards, or sent on recon missions to deal with Arab piracy in the Arabian Sea. Their function is similar to the 18th century privateers, used by the Royal Navy.\nStarting in the 14th century, the Deccan (Southern Peninsular region of India) was divided into two entities: on the one side stood the Muslim Bahmani Sultanate and on the other stood the Hindu kings rallied around the Vijayanagara Empire. Continuous wars demanded frequent resupplies of fresh horses, which were imported through sea routes from Persia and Africa. This trade was subjected to frequent raids by thriving bands of pirates based in the coastal cities of Western India. One of such was Timoji, who operated off Anjadip Island both as a privateer (by seizing horse traders, that he rendered to the raja of Honavar) and as a pirate who attacked the Kerala merchant fleets that traded pepper with Gujarat.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, there was frequent European piracy against Mughal Indian merchants, especially those en route to Mecca for Hajj. The situation came to a head when the Portuguese attacked and captured the vessel \"Rahimi\" which belonged to Mariam Zamani the Mughal queen, which led to the Mughal seizure of the Portuguese town Daman. In the 18th century, the famous Maratha privateer Kanhoji Angre ruled the seas between Mumbai and Goa. The Marathas attacked British shipping and insisted that East India Company ships pay taxes if sailing through their waters.\nPersian Gulf.\nThe southern coast of the Persian Gulf was known to the British from the late 18th century as the \"Pirate Coast, \"where control of the seaways of the Persian Gulf was asserted by the Qawasim (Al Qasimi) and other local maritime powers. Memories of the privations carried out on the coast by Portuguese raiders under Albuquerque were long and local powers antipathetic as a consequence to Christian powers asserting dominance of their coastal waters. Early British expeditions to protect the Imperial Indian Ocean trade from competitors, principally the Al Qasimi from Ras Al Khaimah and Lingeh, led to campaigns against those headquarters and other harbours along the coast in 1809 and then, after a relapse in raiding, again in 1819. This led to the signing of the first formal treaty of maritime peace between the British and the rulers of several coastal sheikhdoms in 1820. This was cemented by the Treaty of Maritime Peace in Perpetuity in 1853, resulting in the British label for the area, 'Pirate Coast' being softened to the 'Trucial Coast', with several emirates being recognised by the British as Trucial States.\nMadagascar.\nAt one point, there were nearly 1,000 pirates located in Madagascar. \u00cele Sainte-Marie was a popular base for pirates throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. The most famous pirate utopia is that of the probably fictional Captain Misson and his pirate crew, who allegedly founded the free colony of Libertatia in northern Madagascar in the late 17th century, until it was destroyed in a surprise attack by the island natives in 1694.\nCaribbean.\n \nThe classic era of piracy in the Caribbean lasted from circa 1650 until the mid-1720s. By 1650, France, England and the United Provinces began to develop their colonial empires. This involved considerable seaborne trade, and a general economic improvement: there was money to be made\u00a0\u2013 or stolen\u00a0\u2013 and much of it traveled by ship.\nFrench buccaneers were established on northwestern part of Hispaniola after the devastations of Osorio as early as 1625, but lived at first mostly as hunters rather than robbers; their transition to full-time piracy was gradual and motivated in part by Spanish efforts to wipe out both the buccaneers and the prey animals on which they depended. The buccaneers' migration from Hispaniola's mainland to the more defensible offshore island of Tortuga limited their resources and accelerated their piratical raids. According to Alexandre Exquemelin, a buccaneer and historian who remains a major source on this period, the Tortuga buccaneer Pierre Le Grand pioneered the settlers' attacks on galleons making the return voyage to Spain.\nThe growth of buccaneering on Tortuga was augmented by the English capture of Jamaica from Spain in 1655. The early English governors of Jamaica freely granted letters of marque to Tortuga buccaneers and to their own countrymen, while the growth of Port Royal provided these raiders with a far more profitable and enjoyable place to sell their booty. In the 1660s, the new French governor of Tortuga, Bertrand d'Ogeron, similarly provided privateering commissions both to his own colonists and to English cutthroats from Port Royal. These conditions brought Caribbean buccaneering to its zenith.\nA new phase of piracy began in the 1690s as English pirates began to look beyond the Caribbean for treasure. The fall of Britain's Stuart kings had restored the traditional enmity between Britain and France, thus ending the profitable collaboration between English Jamaica and French Tortuga. The devastation of Port Royal by an earthquake in 1692 further reduced the Caribbean's attractions by destroying the pirates' chief market for fenced plunder. Caribbean colonial governors began to discard the traditional policy of \"no peace beyond the Line,\" under which it was understood that war would continue (and thus letters of marque would be granted) in the Caribbean regardless of peace treaties signed in Europe; henceforth, commissions would be granted only in wartime, and their limitations would be strictly enforced. Furthermore, much of the Spanish Main had simply been exhausted; Maracaibo alone had been sacked three times between 1667 and 1678, while R\u00edo de la Hacha had been raided five times and Tol\u00fa eight.\nAt the same time, England's less favored colonies, including Bermuda, New York, and Rhode Island, had become cash-starved by the Navigation Acts, which restricted trade with foreign ships. Merchants and governors eager for coin were willing to overlook and even underwrite pirate voyages; one colonial official defended a pirate because he thought it \"very harsh to hang people that brings in gold to these provinces.\" Although some of these pirates operating out of New England and the Middle Colonies targeted Spain's remoter Pacific coast colonies well into the 1690s and beyond, the Indian Ocean was a richer and more tempting target. India's economic output was large during this time, especially in high-value luxury goods like silk and calico which made ideal pirate booty; at the same time, no powerful navies plied the Indian Ocean, leaving both local shipping and the various East India companies' vessels vulnerable to attack. This set the stage for the famous pirates, Thomas Tew, Henry Every, Robert Culliford and (although his guilt remains controversial) William Kidd.\nIn 1713 and 1714, a series of peace treaties ended the War of the Spanish Succession. As a result, thousands of seamen, including European privateers who had operated in the West Indies, were relieved of military duty, at a time when cross-Atlantic colonial shipping trade was beginning to boom. In addition, European sailors who had been pushed by unemployment to work onboard merchantmen (including slave ships) were often enthusiastic to abandon that profession and turn to pirating, giving pirate captains a steady pool of recruits from various coasts across the Atlantic.\nIn 1715, pirates launched a major raid on Spanish divers trying to recover gold from a sunken treasure galleon near Florida. The nucleus of the pirate force was a group of English ex-privateers, all of whom would soon be enshrined in infamy: Henry Jennings, Charles Vane, Samuel Bellamy, and Edward England. The attack was successful, but contrary to their expectations, the governor of Jamaica refused to allow Jennings and their cohorts to spend their loot on his island. With Kingston and the declining Port Royal closed to them, Jennings and his comrades founded a new pirate base at Nassau, on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas, which had been abandoned during the war. Until the arrival of governor Woodes Rogers three years later, Nassau would be home for these pirates and their many recruits.\nShipping traffic between Africa, the Caribbean, and Europe began to soar in the 18th century, a model that was known as triangular trade, and was a rich target for piracy. Trade ships sailed from Europe to the African coast, trading manufactured goods and weapons in exchange for slaves. The traders would then sail to the Caribbean to sell the slaves, and return to Europe with goods such as sugar, tobacco and cocoa. Another triangular trade saw ships carry raw materials, preserved cod, and rum to Europe, where a portion of the cargo would be sold for manufactured goods, which (along with the remainder of the original load) were transported to the Caribbean, where they were exchanged for sugar and molasses, which (with some manufactured articles) were borne to New England. Ships in the triangular trade made money at each stop.\nAs part of the peace settlement of the War of the Spanish succession, Britain obtained the \"asiento\", a Spanish government contract, to supply slaves to Spain's new world colonies, providing British traders and smugglers more access to the traditionally closed Spanish markets in America. This arrangement also contributed heavily to the spread of piracy across the western Atlantic at this time. Shipping to the colonies boomed simultaneously with the flood of skilled mariners after the war. Merchant shippers used the surplus of sailors' labor to drive wages down, cutting corners to maximize their profits, and creating unsavory conditions aboard their vessels. Merchant sailors suffered from mortality rates as high or higher than the slaves being transported (Rediker, 2004). Living conditions were so poor that many sailors began to prefer a freer existence as a pirate. The increased volume of shipping traffic also could sustain a large body of brigands preying upon it. Among the most infamous Caribbean pirates of the time were Edward Teach or \"Blackbeard\", John Rackham, and Bartholomew Roberts. Most of these pirates were eventually hunted down by the Royal Navy and killed or captured; several battles were fought between the brigands and the colonial powers on both land and sea.\nPiracy in the Caribbean declined for the next several decades after 1730, but by the 1810s many pirates roamed the waters though they were not as bold or successful as their predecessors. The most successful pirates of the era were Jean Lafitte and Roberto Cofresi. Lafitte is considered by many to be the last buccaneer due to his army of pirates and fleet of pirate ships which held bases in and around the Gulf of Mexico. Lafitte and his men participated in the War of 1812 battle of New Orleans. Cofresi's base was in Mona Island, Puerto Rico, from where he disrupted the commerce throughout the region. He became the last major target of the international anti-piracy operations.\nThe elimination of piracy from European waters expanded to the Caribbean in the 18th century, West Africa and North America by the 1710s and by the 1720s even the Indian Ocean was a difficult location for pirates to operate.\nEngland began to strongly turn against piracy at the turn of the 18th century, as it was increasingly damaging to the country's economic and commercial prospects in the region. The Piracy Act 1698 for the \"more effectual suppression of Piracy\" made it easier to capture, try and convict pirates by lawfully enabling acts of piracy to be \"examined, inquired of, tried, heard and determined, and adjudged in any place at sea, or upon the land, in any of his Majesty's islands, plantations, colonies, dominions, forts, or factories.\" This effectively enabled admirals to hold a court session to hear the trials of pirates in any place they deemed necessary, rather than requiring that the trial be held in England. Commissioners of these vice-admiralty courts were also vested with \"full power and authority\" to issue warrants, summon the necessary witnesses, and \"to do all thing necessary for the hearing and final determination of any case of piracy, robbery, or felony.\" These new and faster trials provided no legal representation for the pirates; and ultimately led in this era to the execution of 600 pirates, which represented approximately 10 percent of the pirates active at the time in the Caribbean region. Being an accessory to piracy was also criminalised under the statute.\nPiracy saw a brief resurgence between the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713 and around 1720, as many unemployed seafarers took to piracy as a way to make ends meet when a surplus of sailors after the war led to a decline in wages and working conditions. At the same time, one of the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht that ended the war gave to Great Britain's Royal African Company and other British slavers a thirty-year asiento, or contract, to furnish African slaves to the Spanish colonies, providing British merchants and smugglers potential inroads into the traditionally closed Spanish markets in America and leading to an economic revival for the whole region. This revived Caribbean trade provided rich new pickings for a wave of piracy. Also contributing to the increase of Caribbean piracy at this time was Spain's breakup of the English logwood settlement at Campeche and the attractions of a freshly sunken silver fleet off the southern Bahamas in 1715. Fears over the rising levels of crime and piracy, political discontent, concern over crowd behaviour at public punishments, and an increased determination by Parliament to suppress piracy, resulted in the Piracy Act 1717 and Piracy Act 1721. These established a seven-year penal transportation to North America as a possible punishment for those convicted of lesser felonies, or as a possible sentence that capital punishment might be commuted to by royal pardon. In 1717, a pardon was offered to pirates who surrendered to British authorities.\nAfter 1720, piracy in the classic sense became extremely rare as increasingly effective anti-piracy measures were taken by the Royal Navy, making it impossible for any pirate to pursue an effective career for long. By 1718, the British Royal Navy had approximately 124 vessels and 214 by 1815; a big increase from the two vessels England had possessed in 1670. British Royal Navy warships tirelessly hunted down pirate vessels, and almost always won these engagements.\nMany pirates did not surrender and were killed at the point of capture; notorious pirate Edward Teach, or \"Blackbeard\", was hunted down by Lieutenant Robert Maynard at Ocracoke Inlet off the coast of North Carolina on November 22, 1718, and killed. His flagship was a captured French slave ship known originally as \"La Concorde\", he renamed the frigate \"Queen Anne's Revenge\". Captain Chaloner Ogle of HMS \"Swallow\" cornered Bartholomew Roberts in 1722 at Cape Lopez, and a fatal broadside from the \"Swallow\" killed the pirate captain instantly. Roberts' death shocked the pirate world, as well as the Royal Navy. The local merchants and civilians had thought him invincible, and some considered him a hero. Roberts' death was seen by many historians as the end of the Golden Age of Piracy. Also crucial to the end of this era of piracy was the loss of the pirates' last Caribbean safe haven at Nassau.\nIn the early 19th century, piracy along the East and Gulf Coasts of North America as well as in the Caribbean increased again. Jean Lafitte was just one of hundreds of pirates operating in American and Caribbean waters between the years of 1820 and 1835. The United States Navy repeatedly engaged pirates in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and in the Mediterranean. Cofres\u00ed's \"El Mosquito\" was disabled in a collaboration between Spain and the United States. After fleeing for hours, he was ambushed and captured inland. The United States landed shore parties on several islands in the Caribbean in pursuit of pirates; Cuba was a major haven. By the 1830s piracy had died out again, and the navies of the region focused on the slave trade.\nAbout the time of the Mexican\u2013American War in 1846, the United States Navy had grown strong and numerous enough to eliminate the pirate threat in the West Indies. By the 1830s, ships had begun to convert to steam propulsion, so the Age of Sail and the classical idea of pirates in the Caribbean ended. Privateering, similar to piracy, continued as an asset in war for a few more decades and proved to be of some importance during the naval campaigns of the American Civil War.\nPrivateering would remain a tool of European states until the mid-19th century's Declaration of Paris. But letters of marque were given out much more sparingly by governments and were terminated as soon as conflicts ended. The idea of \"no peace beyond the Line\" was a relic that had no meaning by the more settled late 18th and early 19th centuries.\nCanary Islands.\nDue to the strategic situation of this Spanish archipelago as a crossroads of maritime routes and commercial bridge between Europe, Africa and America, this was one of the places on the planet with the greatest pirate presence.\nIn the Canary Islands, the following stand out: the attacks and continuous looting of Berber, English, French and Dutch corsairs sometimes successful and often a failure; and on the other hand, the presence of pirates and corsairs from this archipelago, who made their incursions into the Caribbean. Pirates and corsairs such as Fran\u00e7ois Le Clerc, Jacques de Sores, Francis Drake defeat in Gran Canaria, Pieter van der Does, Murat Reis and Horacio Nelson attacked the islands and was defeated in the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797). Among those born in the archipelago stands out above all Amaro Pargo, whom the monarch Felipe V of Spain frequently benefited in his commercial incursions and corsairs.\nSanta Cruz de Tenerife was, especially during the first half of the 18th century, the most important corsair center in the Macaronesian region. The recent discovery of abundant documentary evidence of significant corsair activity, carried out primarily by natives, residents, and those living on the island, confirms this fact. At the same time, the numerous pirate ships that frequented the Canary Islands waters used landing places along its coast. Such was the case of Valle de Salazar or San Andr\u00e9s, which had acquired a reputation as a \"pirate port\" until the construction of its castle or defensive tower.\nNorth America.\nPiracy on the east coast of North America first became common in the early seventeenth century, as English privateers discharged after the end of the Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604) turned to piracy. The most famous and successful of these early pirates was Peter Easton.\nRiver piracy in late 18th-mid-19th century America was primarily concentrated along the Ohio River and Mississippi River valleys. In 1803, at Tower Rock, the U.S. Army dragoons, possibly, from the frontier army post up river at Fort Kaskaskia, on the Illinois side opposite St. Louis, raided and drove out the river pirates.\nStack Island was also associated with river pirates and counterfeiters in the late 1790s. In 1809, the last major river pirate activity took place, on the Upper Mississippi River, and river piracy in this area came to an abrupt end, when a group of flatboatmen raided the island, wiping out the river pirates. From 1790 to 1834, Cave-In-Rock was the principal outlaw lair and headquarters of river pirate activity in the Ohio River region, from which Samuel Mason led a gang of river pirates on the Ohio River.\nRiver piracy continued on the lower Mississippi River, from the early 1800s to the mid-1830s, declining as a result of direct military action and local law enforcement and regulator-vigilante groups that uprooted and swept out pockets of outlaw resistance.\n\"Roaring\" Dan Seavey was a pirate active in the early 1900s in the Great Lakes region who joined the United States Marshals Service in later life, working to curb poaching, smuggling, and piracy on Lake Michigan.\nCulture and social structure.\nRewards.\nPirates had a system of hierarchy on board their ships determining how captured money was distributed. However, pirates were more egalitarian than any other area of employment at the time. In fact, pirate quartermasters were a counterbalance to the captain and had the power to veto his orders. The majority of plunder was in the form of cargo and ship's equipment, with medicines the most highly prized. A vessel's doctor's chest would be worth anywhere from \u00a3300 to \u00a3400, or around $470,000 in today's values. Jewels were common plunder but not popular, as they were hard to sell, and pirates, unlike the public of today, had little concept of their value. There is one case recorded where a pirate was given a large diamond worth a great deal more than the value of the handful of small diamonds given to his crewmates as a share. He felt cheated and had it broken up to match what they received.\nSpanish pieces of eight minted in Mexico or Seville were the standard trade currency in the American colonies. However, every colony still used the monetary units of pounds, shillings, and pence for bookkeeping while Spanish, German, French, and Portuguese money were all standard mediums of exchange as British law prohibited the export of British silver coinage. Until the exchange rates were standardised in the late 18th century each colony legislated its own different exchange rates. In England, 1 piece of eight was worth 4s 3d while it was worth 8s in New York, 7s 6d in Pennsylvania and 6s 8d in Virginia. One 18th-century English shilling was worth around $58 in modern currency, so a piece of eight could be worth anywhere from $246 to $465. As such, the value of pirate plunder could vary considerably, depending on who recorded it and where.\nOrdinary seamen received a part of the plunder at the captain's discretion but usually a single share. On average, a pirate could expect the equivalent of a year's wages as his share from each ship captured while the crew of the most successful pirates would often each receive a share valued at around \u00a31,000 ($1.17\u00a0million) at least once in their career. One of the larger amounts taken from a single ship was that by captain Thomas Tew from an Indian merchantman in 1692. Each ordinary seaman on his ship received a share worth \u00a33,000 ($3.5\u00a0million), with officers receiving proportionally larger amounts as per the agreed shares, with Tew himself receiving 2\u00bd shares. It is known there were actions with multiple ships captured where a single share was worth almost double this.\nBy contrast, an ordinary seamen in the Royal Navy received 19s per month to be paid in a lump sum at the end of a tour of duty, which was around half the rate paid in the Merchant Navy. However, corrupt officers would often \"tax\" their crews' wage to supplement their own, and the Royal Navy of the day was infamous for its reluctance to pay. From this wage, 6d per month was deducted for the maintenance of Greenwich Hospital, with similar amounts deducted for the Chatham Chest, the chaplain and surgeon. Six months' pay was withheld to discourage desertion. That this was insufficient incentive is revealed in a report on proposed changes to the RN Admiral Nelson wrote in 1803; he noted that since 1793 more than 42,000 sailors had deserted. Roughly half of all RN crews were pressganged and these not only received lower wages than volunteers but were shackled while the vessel was docked and were never permitted to go ashore until released from service.\nAlthough the Royal Navy suffered from many morale issues, it answered the question of prize money via the Cruizers and Convoys Act 1708 which handed over the share previously gained by the Crown to the captors of the ship. Technically it was still possible for the Crown to get the money or a portion of it but this rarely happened. The process of condemnation of a captured vessel and its cargo and men was given to the High Court of the Admiralty and this was the process which remained in force with minor changes throughout the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.\nEven the flag officer's share was not quite straightforward; he would only get the full one-eighth if he had no junior flag officer beneath him. If this was the case then he would get a third share. If he had more than one then he would take one-half while the rest was shared out equally.\nThere was a great deal of money to be made in this way. The record breaker was the capture of the Spanish frigate \"Hermione\", which was carrying treasure in 1762. The value of this was so great that each individual seaman netted \u00a3485 ($1.4\u00a0million in 2008 dollars). The two captains responsible, Evans and Pownall, received \u00a365,000 each ($188.4\u00a0million). In January 1807 the frigate \"Caroline\" took the Spanish \"San Rafael\", which brought in \u00a352,000 for her captain, Peter Rainier (who had been only a midshipman some thirteen months before). All through the wars there are examples of this kind of luck falling on captains. Another famous 'capture' was that of the Spanish frigates \"Thetis\" and \"Santa Brigada\", which were loaded with gold specie. They were taken by four British frigates who shared the money, each captain receiving \u00a340,730. Each lieutenant got \u00a35,091, the Warrant Officer group, \u00a32,468, the midshipmen \u00a3791 and the individual seamen \u00a3182.\nIt should also be noted that it was usually only the frigates which took prizes; the ships of the line were far too ponderous to be able to chase and capture the smaller ships which generally carried treasure. Nelson always bemoaned that he had done badly out of prize money and even as a flag officer received little. This was not that he had a bad command of captains but rather that British mastery of the seas was so complete that few enemy ships dared to sail.\nLoot.\nEven though pirates raided many ships, few, if any, buried their treasure. Often, the \"treasure\" that was stolen was food, water, alcohol, weapons, or clothing. Other things they stole were household items like bits of soap and gear like rope and anchors, or sometimes they would keep the ship they captured (either to sell off or keep because it was better than their ship). Such items were likely to be needed immediately, rather than saved for future trade. For this reason, there was no need for the pirates to bury these goods. Pirates tended to kill few people aboard the ships they captured; usually they would kill no one if the ship surrendered, because if it became known that pirates took no prisoners, their victims would fight to the last breath and make victory both very difficult and costly in lives. In contrast, ships would quickly surrender if they knew they would be spared. In one well-documented case 300 heavily armed soldiers on a ship attacked by Thomas Tew surrendered after a brief battle with none of Tew's 40-man crew being injured.\nPunishment.\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, once pirates were caught, justice was meted out in a summary fashion, and many ended their lives by \"dancing the hempen jig\", a euphemism for hanging. Public execution was a form of entertainment at the time, and people came out to watch them as they would to a sporting event today. Newspapers reported details such as condemned men's last words, the prayers said by the priests, and descriptions of their final moments in the gallows. In England most of these executions took place at Execution Dock on the River Thames in London.\nIn the cases of more famous prisoners, usually captains, their punishments extended beyond death. Their bodies were enclosed in iron cages (gibbet) (for which they were measured before their execution) and left to swing in the air until the flesh rotted off them- a process that could take as long as two years. The bodies of captains such as William \"Captain\" Kidd, Charles Vane, William Fly, and John Rackham, were all treated this manner.\nRole of women.\nWhile piracy was predominantly a male occupation throughout history, a minority of pirates were female. Pirates did not allow women onto their ships very often. Additionally, women were often regarded as bad luck among pirates. It was feared that the male members of the crew would argue and fight over the women. On many ships, women (as well as young boys) were prohibited by the ship's contract, which all crew members were required to sign. \nOnly four female pirates are known to have been active during the Golden Age of Piracy. They were Anne Bonny and Mary Read, women who served under John Rackham in 1720, Mary Critchett an escaped prisoner in 1729, and Martha Farley the wife of a minor pirate in 1727.\nDemocracy among Caribbean pirates.\nUnlike traditional Western societies of the time, many Caribbean pirate crews of European descent operated as limited democracies. Pirate communities were some of the first to instate a system of checks and balances similar to the one used by the present-day democracies. The first record of such a government aboard a pirate sloop dates to the 17th century.\nPirate Code.\nAs recorded by Captain Charles Johnson regarding the articles of Bartholomew Roberts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nKnown pirate shipwrecks.\nTo date, the following identifiable pirate shipwrecks have been discovered:\nPrivateers.\nA privateer or corsair used similar methods to a pirate, but acted under orders of the state while in possession of a commission or letter of marque and reprisal from a government or monarch authorizing the capture of merchant ships belonging to an enemy nation. For example, the United States Constitution of 1787 specifically authorized Congress to issue letters of marque and reprisal. The letter of marque and reprisal was recognized by international convention and meant that a privateer could not technically be charged with piracy while attacking the targets named in his commission. This nicety of law did not always save the individuals concerned, however, since whether one was considered a pirate or a legally operating privateer often depended on whose custody the individual found himself in\u2014that of the country that had issued the commission, or that of the object of attack. Spanish authorities were known to execute foreign privateers with their letters of marque hung around their necks to emphasize Spain's rejection of such defenses. Furthermore, many privateers exceeded the bounds of their letters of marque by attacking nations with which their sovereign was at peace (Thomas Tew and William Kidd are notable alleged examples), and thus made themselves liable to conviction for piracy. However, a letter of marque did provide some cover for such pirates, as plunder seized from neutral or friendly shipping could be passed off later as taken from enemy merchants.\nThe famous Barbary corsairs of the Mediterranean, authorized by the Ottoman Empire, were privateers, as were the Maltese corsairs, who were authorized by the Knights of St. John, and the Dunkirkers in the service of the Spanish Empire. In the years 1626\u20131634 alone, the Dunkirk privateers captured 1,499 ships, and sank another 336. From 1609 to 1616, England lost 466 merchant ships to Barbary pirates, and 160 British ships were captured by Algerians between 1677 and 1680. One famous privateer was Sir Francis Drake. His patron was Queen Elizabeth I, and their relationship ultimately proved to be quite profitable for England.\nPrivateers constituted a large proportion of the total military force at sea during the 17th and 18th centuries. During the Nine Years War, the French adopted a policy of strongly encouraging privateers (French corsairs), including the famous Jean Bart, to attack English and Dutch shipping. England lost roughly 4,000 merchant ships during the war. In the following War of Spanish Succession, privateer attacks continued, Britain losing 3,250 merchant ships. During the War of Austrian Succession, Britain lost 3,238 merchant ships and France lost 3,434 merchant ships to the British.\nDuring King George's War, approximately 36,000 Americans served aboard privateers at one time or another. During the American Revolution, about 55,000 American seamen served aboard the privateers. The American privateers had almost 1,700 ships, and they captured 2,283 enemy ships. Between the end of the Revolutionary War and 1812, less than 30 years, Britain, France, Naples, the Barbary states, Spain, and the Netherlands seized approximately 2,500 American ships. Payments in ransom and tribute to the Barbary states amounted to 20% of United States government annual revenues in 1800. Throughout the American Civil War, Confederate privateers successfully harassed Union merchant ships.\nPrivateering lost international sanction under the Declaration of Paris in 1856.\nCommerce raiders.\nA wartime activity similar to piracy involves disguised warships called commerce raiders or merchant raiders, which attack enemy shipping commerce, approaching by stealth and then opening fire. Commerce raiders operated successfully during the American Revolution. During the American Civil War, the Confederacy sent out several commerce raiders, the most famous of which was the CSS \"Alabama\". During World War I and World War II, Germany also made use of these tactics, both in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Since commissioned naval vessels were openly used, these commerce raiders should not be considered even privateers, much less pirates\u2014although the opposing combatants were vocal in denouncing them as such.\nContemporary piracy.\nSeaborne piracy against transport vessels is a significant issue, with estimated worldwide losses of US$16\u00a0billion per year in 2004, increased to US$25\u00a0billion over the next 20 years. Waters between the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, off the Somali coast, and also in the Strait of Malacca and Singapore, which are used by over 50,000 commercial ships a year. In the Gulf of Guinea, maritime piracy has also led to pressure on offshore oil and gas production, providing security for offshore installations and supply vessels is often paid for by oil companies rather than the respective governments. In the late 2000s, the emergence of piracy off the coast of Somalia spurred a multi-national effort led by the United States to patrol the waters near the Horn of Africa. In 2011, Brazil also created an anti-piracy unit on the Amazon River. Sir Peter Blake, a New Zealand world champion yachtsman, was killed by pirates on the Amazon river in 2001.\nIn the European Union, vessels suffer river piracy, with attacks on the Serbian and Romanian stretches of the Danube river, an international waterway.\nModern pirates favor small boats and taking advantage of the small number of crew members on modern cargo vessels. They also use large vessels to supply the smaller attack/boarding vessels. Modern pirates can be successful because a large amount of international commerce occurs via shipping. Major shipping routes take cargo ships through narrow bodies of water such as the Gulf of Aden and the Strait of Malacca making them vulnerable to be overtaken and boarded by small motorboats. Other active areas include the South China Sea and the Niger Delta. As usage increases, many of these ships have to lower cruising speeds to allow for navigation and traffic control, making them prime targets for piracy.\nAlso, pirates often operate in regions of poor developing or struggling countries with small or nonexistent navies and large trade routes. Pirates sometimes evade capture by sailing into waters controlled by their pursuer's enemies. With the end of the Cold War, navies have decreased in size and patrol less frequently, while trade has increased, making organized piracy far easier. Modern pirates are sometimes linked with organized-crime syndicates, but often are small individual groups.\nThe International Maritime Bureau (IMB) maintains statistics regarding pirate attacks dating back to 1995. Their records indicate hostage-taking overwhelmingly dominates the types of violence against seafarers. For example, in 2006, there were 239 attacks, 77 crew members were kidnapped and 188 taken hostage but only 15 of the pirate attacks resulted in murder. In 2007 the attacks rose by 10 percent to 263 attacks. There was a 35 percent increase on reported attacks involving guns. Crew members that were injured numbered 64 compared to just 17 in 2006. That number does not include instances of hostage taking and kidnapping where the victims were not injured.\nThe number of attacks from January to September 2009 had surpassed the previous year's total due to the increased pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden and off Somalia. Between January and September the number of attacks rose to 306 from 293. Pirates boarded the vessels in 114 cases and hijacked 34 of them. Gun use in pirate attacks increased to 176 cases from 76 in 2008.\nRather than cargo, modern pirates have targeted the personal belongings of the crew and the contents of the ship's safe, which potentially contains large amounts of cash needed for payroll and port fees. In other cases, the pirates force the crew off the ship and then sail it to a port to be repainted and given a new identity through false papers purchased from corrupt or complicit officials.\nModern piracy can take place in conditions of political unrest. For example, following the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam, Thai piracy was aimed at the many Vietnamese who took to boats to escape. Further, following the disintegration of the government of Somalia, warlords in the region have attacked ships delivering UN food aid.\nThe attack against the German-built cruise ship the \"Seabourn Spirit\" offshore of Somalia in November 2005 is an example of the sophisticated pirates mariners face. The pirates carried out their attack more than offshore with speedboats launched from a larger mother ship. The attackers were armed with automatic firearms and an RPG.\nSince 2008, Somali pirates centered in the Gulf of Aden made about $120 million annually, reportedly costing the shipping industry between $900 million and $3.3 billion per year. By September 2012, the heyday of piracy in the Indian Ocean was reportedly over. Backers were now reportedly reluctant to finance pirate expeditions due to the low rate of success, and pirates were no longer able to reimburse their creditors. According to the International Maritime Bureau, pirate attacks had by October 2012 dropped to a six-year low. Only five ships were captured by the end of the year, representing a decrease from 25 in 2011 and 27 in 2010, with only one ship attacked in the third quarter compared to 36 during the same period in 2011. However, pirate incidents off on the West African seaboard increased to 34 from 30 the previous year, and attacks off the coast of Indonesia rose from 2011's total of 46 to 51.\nMany nations forbid ships to enter their territorial waters or ports if the crew of the ships are armed, in an effort to restrict possible piracy. Shipping companies sometimes hire private armed security guards.\nModern definitions of piracy include the following acts:\nTogether with treason and counterfeiting; piracy, including acts against the law of nations, is one of three criminal offenses against which the United States Congress is delegated power to enact penal legislation by the Constitution of the United States.\nIn modern times, ships and airplanes are hijacked for political reasons as well. The perpetrators of these acts could be described as pirates (for instance, the French term for \"plane hijacker\" is \"pirate de l'air\", literally \"air pirate\"), but in English are usually termed \"hijackers\". An example is the hijacking of the Italian civilian passenger ship by the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1985, which is regarded as an act of piracy. A 2009 book entitled \"International Legal Dimension of Terrorism\" called the attackers \"terrorists\".\nModern pirates also use a great deal of technology. It has been reported that crimes of piracy have involved the use of mobile phones, satellite phones, GPS, machetes, AK74 rifles, sonar systems, modern speedboats, shotguns, pistols, mounted machine guns, and even RPGs and grenade launchers.\nIn 2020, the amount of piracy increased by 24% after being at its lowest 21st century level in 2019. The Americas and Africa have been identified by the International Chamber of Commerce as the most vulnerable to piracy as a result of less-wealthy governments in the regions being unable to adequately combat piracy.\nIMB Piracy Reporting Centre keeps a live piracy map to help keep track of all recent piracy and armed robbery incidents.\nAnti-piracy measures.\nUnder a principle of international law known as the \"universality principle\", a government may \"exercise jurisdiction over conduct outside its territory if that conduct is universally dangerous to states and their nationals.\" The rationale behind the universality principle is that states will punish certain acts \"wherever they may occur as a means of protecting the global community as a whole, even absent a link between the state and the parties or the acts in question.\" Under this principle, the concept of \"universal jurisdiction\" applies to the crime of piracy. For example, the United States has a statute (section 1651 of title 18 of the United States Code) imposing a sentence of life in prison for piracy \"as defined by the law of nations\" committed anywhere on the high seas, regardless of the nationality of the pirates or the victims.\nThe goal of maritime security operations is \"actively to deter, disrupt and suppress piracy in order to protect global maritime security and secure freedom of navigation for the benefit of all nations\", and pirates are often detained, interrogated, disarmed, and released. With millions of dollars at stake, pirates have little incentive to stop. In Finland, one case involved pirates who had been captured and whose boat was sunk. As the pirates attacked a vessel of Singapore, not Finland, and are not themselves EU or Finnish citizens, they were not prosecuted. A further complication in many cases, including this one, is that many countries do not allow extradition of people to jurisdictions where they may be sentenced to death or torture.\nThe Dutch are using a 17th-century law against \"sea robbery\" to prosecute. Warships that capture pirates have no jurisdiction to try them, and NATO does not have a detention policy in place. Prosecutors have a hard time assembling witnesses and finding translators, and countries are reluctant to imprison pirates because the countries would be saddled with the pirates upon their release.\nThe Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia formed in November 2006.\nSince the 2010s, the U.S. Navy and others have been developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems that generate piracy alerts based on surveillance data.\nSelf-defense.\nThe fourth volume of the handbook: \"Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy off the Coast of Somalia and in the Arabian Sea Area\" (known as BMP4) is the current authoritative guide for merchant ships on self-defense against pirates. The guide is issued and updated by \"Oil Companies International Marine Forum\" (OCIMF), a consortium of interested international shipping and trading organizations including the EU, NATO and the International Maritime Bureau. It is distributed primarily by the Maritime Security Centre \u2013 Horn of Africa (MSCHOA), the planning and coordination authority for EU naval forces (EUNAVFOR).\nThe BMP4 encourages vessels to register their voyages through the region with MSCHOA, as this registration is a key component of the operation of the International Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC, the navy-patrolled route through the Gulf of Aden). The BMP4 contains a chapter entitled \"Self-Protective Measures\" which lays out a list of steps a merchant vessel can take to make itself less of a target to pirates, and make it better able to repel an attack if one occurs. This list includes rigging the deck of the ship with razor wire, rigging fire-hoses to spray sea-water over the side of the ship to hinder boardings, having a distinctive pirate alarm, hardening the bridge against gunfire and creating a \"citadel\" where the crew can retreat if pirates get on board. Other unofficial self-defense measures that can be found on merchant vessels include the setting up of mannequins posing as armed guards or firing flares at the pirates.\nThough it varies by country, generally peacetime law in the 20th and 21st centuries has not allowed merchant vessels to carry weapons. As a response to the rise in modern piracy, however, the U.S. government changed its rules so that it is now possible for U.S.-flagged vessels to embark a team of armed private security guards. The US Coastguard leaves it to ship owners' discretion to determine if those guards will be armed. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) in 2011 changed its stance on private armed guards, accepting that operators must be able to defend their ships against pirate attacks.\nThis has given birth to a new breed of private security companies that provide training for crew members and operate floating armouries for protection of crew and cargo. This has proved effective in countering pirate attacks. The use of floating armouries in international waters allows ships to carry weapons in international waters, without being in possession of arms within coastal waters where they would be illegal. Seychelles has become a central location for international anti-piracy operations, hosting the Anti-Piracy Operation Center for the Indian Ocean. In 2008, VSOS became the first authorized armed maritime security company to operate in the Indian Ocean region.\nWith safety trials complete in the late 2000s, laser dazzlers have been developed for defensive purposes on super-yachts. They can be effective up to with the effects going from mild disorientation to flash blindness at closer range.\nIn February 2012, Italian Marines based on the tanker \"Enrica Lexie\" allegedly fired on an Indian fishing trawler off Kerala, killing two of her eleven crew. The Marines allegedly mistook the fishing vessel as a pirate vessel. The incident sparked a diplomatic row between India and Italy. \"Enrica Lexie\" was ordered into Kochi where her crew were questioned by officers of the Indian Police. The fact is still \"sub juris\" and its legal eventual outcome could influence future deployment of VPDs, since states will be either encouraged or discouraged to provide them depending on whether functional immunity is ultimately granted or denied to the Italians.\nAnother similar incident has been reported to have happened in the Red Sea between the coasts of Somalia and Yemen, involving the death of a Yemeni fisherman allegedly at the hands of a Russian Vessel Protection Detachment (VPD) on board a Norwegian-flagged vessel.\nDespite VPD deployment being controversial because of these incidents, according to the Associated Press, during a United Nations Security Council conference about piracy \"U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice told the council that no ship carrying armed guards has been successfully attacked by pirates\" and \"French Ambassador Gerard Araud stressed that private guards do not have the deterrent effect that government-posted marine and sailors and naval patrols have in warding off attacks\".\nSelf protection measures.\nThe best protection against pirates is to avoid encountering them. This can be accomplished by using tools such as radar, or by using specialised systems that use shorter wavelengths, as small boats are not always picked up by radar. An example of a specialised system is WatchStander.\nWhile the non-wartime 20th century tradition has been for merchant vessels not to be armed, the U.S. Government has recently changed the rules so that it is now \"best practice\" for vessels to embark a team of armed private security guards. The guards are usually supplied from ships intended specifically for training and supplying such armed personnel. The crew can be given weapons training, and warning shots can be fired legally in international waters.\nOther measures vessels can take to protect themselves against piracy are air-pressurised boat stopping systems which can fire a variety of vessel-disabling projectiles, implementing a high freewall and vessel boarding protection systems (e.g., hot water wall, electricity-charged water wall, automated fire monitor, slippery foam). Ships can also attempt to protect themselves using their Automatic Identification Systems (AIS). Every ship over 300 tons carries a transponder supplying both information about the ship itself and its movements. Any unexpected change in this information can attract attention.\nPreviously this data could only be picked up if there was a nearby ship, rendering single ships vulnerable. Special satellites have been launched recently that are now able to detect and retransmit this data. Large ships cannot therefore be hijacked without being detected. This can act as a deterrent to attempts to either hijack the entire ship, or steal large portions of cargo with another ship, since an escort can be sent more quickly.\nPatrol.\nIn an emergency warships can be called upon. In some areas such as near Somalia, patrolling naval vessels from different nations are available to intercept vessels attacking merchant vessels. For patrolling dangerous coastal waters, or keeping cost down, robotic or remote-controlled USVs are also sometimes used. Shore- and vessel-launched UAVs are used by the U.S. Navy. A British former British chief of defence staff (David Richards), questioned the value of expensive kit procured by successive governments, saying \"We have \u00a31bn destroyers trying to sort out pirates in a little dhow with RPGs [rocket-propelled grenade launchers] costing US$50, with an outboard motor [costing] $100\".\nLegal aspects.\nUnited Kingdom laws.\nSection 2 of the Piracy Act 1837 creates a statutory offence of aggravated piracy. See also the Piracy Act 1850.\nIn 2008 the British Foreign Office advised the Royal Navy not to detain pirates of certain nationalities as they might be able to claim asylum in Britain under British human rights legislation, if their national laws included execution, or mutilation as a judicial punishment for crimes committed as pirates.\nDefinition of piracy jure gentium.\nSee section 26 of, and Schedule 5 to, the Merchant Shipping and Maritime Security Act 1997. These provisions replace the Schedule to the Tokyo Convention Act 1967. In \"Cameron v HM Advocate\", 1971 SLT 333, the High Court of Justiciary said that that Schedule supplemented the existing law and did not seek to restrict the scope of the offence of piracy jure gentium.\nSee also:\nJurisdiction.\nSee section 46(2) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 and http:// of the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act 1878. See also \"R v Kohn\" (1864) 4 F &amp; F 68.\nPiracy committed by or against aircraft.\nSee section 5 of the Aviation Security Act 1982.\nSentence.\nThe book \"Archbold\" says that in a case that does not fall within section 2 of the Piracy Act 1837, the penalty appears to be determined by the Offences at Sea Act 1799, which provides that offences committed at sea are liable to the same penalty as if they had been committed upon the shore.\nHistory.\nWilliam Hawkins said that under common law, piracy by a subject was esteemed to be petty treason. The Treason Act 1351 provided that this was not petty treason.\nIn English admiralty law, piracy was classified as petty treason during the medieval period, and offenders were accordingly liable to be hanged, drawn and quartered on conviction. Piracy was redefined as a felony during the reign of Henry VIII. In either case, piracy cases were cognizable in the courts of the Lord High Admiral. English judges in admiralty courts and vice admiralty courts emphasized that \"neither Faith nor Oath is to be kept\" with pirates; i.e. contracts with pirates and oaths sworn to them were not legally binding. Pirates were legally subject to summary execution by their captors if captured in battle. In practice, instances of summary justice and annulment of oaths and contracts involving pirates do not appear to have been common.\nUnited States laws.\nIn the United States, criminal prosecution of piracy is authorized in the :\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of Nations;\nThe founding fathers were at loggerheads over piracy. and the Marshall Court (1801-1835) dealt with many cases of piracy. In 1820 the penalty for piracy was death. By 1909 the penalty was life imprisonment. Title \u00a0https:// now states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Whoever, on the high seas, commits the crime of piracy as defined by the law of nations, and is afterwards brought into or found in the United States, shall be imprisoned for life.\nCiting the United States Supreme Court decision in the 1820 case of \"United States v. Smith (1820)\", a U.S. District Court ruled in 2010 in the case of \"United States v. Said\" that the definition of piracy under section 1651 is confined to \"robbery at sea\". The piracy charges (but not other serious federal charges) against the defendants in the \"Said\" case were dismissed by the Court.\nThe U.S. District Court for the E.D.Va. has since been overturned: \"On May 23, 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued an opinion vacating the Court's dismissal of the piracy count. \"United States v. Said\", 680 F.3d 374 (4th Cir.2012). See also \"United States v. Dire\", 680 F.3d 446, 465 (4th Cir.2012) (upholding an instruction to the jury that the crime of piracy includes 'any of the three following actions: (A) any illegal acts of violence or detention or any act of depredation committed for private ends on the high seas or a place outside the jurisdiction of any state by the crew or the passengers of a private ship and directed against another ship or against persons or property on board such ship; or (B) any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship; or (C) any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in (A) or (B) above\").'\" The case was remanded to E.D. Va., see \"US v. Said\", 3 F. Supp. 3d 515 \u2013 Dist. Court, ED Virginia (2014).\nInternational law.\nEffects on international boundaries.\nDuring the 18th century, the British and the Dutch controlled opposite sides of the Straits of Malacca. The British and the Dutch drew a line separating the Straits into two halves. The agreement was that each party would be responsible for combating piracy in their respective half. Eventually this line became the border between Malaysia and Indonesia in the Straits.\nLaw of nations.\nPiracy is of note in international law as it is commonly held to represent the earliest invocation of the concept of universal jurisdiction. The crime of piracy is considered a breach of , a conventional peremptory international norm that states must uphold. Those committing thefts on the high seas, inhibiting trade, and endangering maritime communication are considered by sovereign states to hold the status of (an enemy of humankind).\nBecause of universal jurisdiction, action can be taken against pirates without objection from the flag state of the pirate vessel. This represents an exception to the principle (\"One who exercises jurisdiction out of his territory is disobeyed with impunity\").\nA Convention on Piracy was adopted by the League of Nations in 1932. To this day, the Harvard Draft adds to the debate of what constitutes piracy.\nInternational conventions.\nArticles 101 to 103 of UNCLOS.\nArticles 101 to 103 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) (1982) contain a definition of piracy \"iure gentium\" (i.e. according to international law). They read:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Article 101\n\"Definition of piracy\"\nPiracy consists of any of the following acts:\nArticle 102\n\"Piracy by a warship, government ship or government aircraft whose crew has mutinied\"\nThe acts of piracy, as defined in article 101, committed by a warship, government ship or government aircraft whose crew has mutinied and taken control of the ship or aircraft are assimilated to acts committed by a private ship or aircraft.\nArticle 103\n\"Definition of a pirate ship or aircraft\"\nA ship or aircraft is considered a pirate ship or aircraft if it is intended by the persons in dominant control to be used for the purpose of committing one of the acts referred to in article 101. The same applies if the ship or aircraft has been used to commit any such act, so long as it remains under the control of the persons guilty of that act.\nThis definition was formerly contained in articles 15 to 17 of the Convention on the High Seas signed at Geneva on April 29, 1958. It was drafted by the International Law Commission.\nA limitation of article 101 above is that it confines piracy to the High Seas. As the majority of piratical acts occur within territorial waters, some pirates are able to go free as certain jurisdictions lack the resources to monitor their borders adequately.\nIMB definition.\nThe International Maritime Bureau (IMB) defines piracy as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the act of boarding any vessel with an intent to commit theft or any other crime, and with an intent or capacity to use force in furtherance of that act.\nUniformity in maritime piracy law.\nGiven the diverging definitions of piracy in international and municipal legal systems, some authors argue that greater uniformity in the law is required in order to strengthen anti-piracy legal instruments.\nCultural perceptions.\nPirates are a frequent topic in fiction and, in their Caribbean incarnation, are associated with certain stereotypical manners of speaking and dress, some of them wholly fictional: \"nearly all our notions of their behavior come from the golden age of fictional piracy, which reached its zenith in 1881 with the appearance of Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Treasure Island\".\" Hugely influential in shaping the popular conception of pirates, Captain Charles Johnson's \"A General History of the Pyrates\", published in London in 1724, is the prime source for the biographies of many well known pirates of the Golden Age. The book gives an almost mythical status to pirates, with naval historian David Cordingly writing: \"it has been said, and there seems no reason to question this, that Captain Johnson created the modern conception of pirates.\"\nIn the 1830s, Letitia Elizabeth Landon received material relating to piracy for an annual for which she was responsible and she produced two Pirate Songs, the first in 1831, \" and the second, \" in 1837. This last was reproduced many times as \"The Pirate's Song\", often uncredited. Bona is now the city of Annaba in Algeria.\nSome inventions of pirate culture such as \"walking the plank\"\u2014in which a bound captive is forced to walk off a board extending over the sea\u2014were popularized by J. M. Barrie's 1911 novel, \"Peter Pan\", where the fictional pirate Captain Hook and his crew helped define the fictional pirate archetype. English actor Robert Newton's portrayal of Long John Silver in Disney's 1950 film adaptation also helped define the modern rendition of a pirate, including the stereotypical West Country \"pirate accent\". Other influences include \"Sinbad the Sailor\", and the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" films have helped rekindle modern interest in piracy and have performed well at the box office. The video game \"\" revolves around pirates during the Golden Age of Piracy.\nThe classic 1879 Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera \"The Pirates of Penzance\" focuses on The Pirate King and his hapless band of pirates.\nMany sports teams use \"pirate\" or a related term such as \"raider\" or \"buccaneer\" as their nickname, based on the popular stereotypes of pirates. The earliest such example was probably the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball that acquired their nickname in 1891 after allegedly \"pirating\" a player from another team. Many amateur and school-based sports programs along with several professional sports franchises have also adopted pirate-related names, including the Las Vegas Raiders and Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League. In turn, the Buccaneer's name was inspired by the Gasparilla Pirate Festival, a large community parade and related events in Tampa, Florida centered around the legend of Jos\u00e9 Gaspar, a mythical pirate who supposedly operated in the area.\nEconomics of piracy.\nSources on the economics of piracy include Cyrus Karraker's 1953 study \"Piracy was a Business\",\nin which the author discusses pirates in terms of contemporary racketeering. Patrick Crowhurst researched French piracy and David Starkey focused on British 18th-century piracy. Note also the 1998 book \"The Invisible Hook: The Hidden Economics of Pirates\" by Peter T. Leeson.\nPiracy and entrepreneurship.\nSome 2014 research examines the links between piracy and entrepreneurship. In this context, researchers take a nonmoral approach to piracy as a source of inspiration for 2010s-era entrepreneurship education and to research in entrepreneurship and in business-model generation.\nIn this respect, analysis of piracy operations may distinguish between planned (organised) and opportunistic piracy.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Because an arbitrary smooth potential can usually be approximated as a harmonic potential at the vicinity of a stable equilibrium point, it is one of the most important model systems in quantum mechanics. Furthermore, it is one of the few quantum-mechanical systems for which an exact, analytical solution is known..\nOne-dimensional harmonic oscillator.\nHamiltonian and energy eigenstates.\nThe Hamiltonian of the particle is:\nformula_1\nThe functions \"Hn\" are the physicists' Hermite polynomials,\nformula_2\nThe corresponding energy levels are\nformula_3The expectation values of position and momentum combined with variance of each variable can be derived from the wavefunction to understand the behavior of the energy eigenkets. They are shown to be formula_4 and formula_5 owing to the symmetry of the problem, whereas:\nformula_6\nformula_7\nThe variance in both position and momentum are observed to increase for higher energy levels. The lowest energy level has value of formula_8 which is its minimum value due to uncertainty relation and also corresponds to a gaussian wavefunction.\nThis energy spectrum is noteworthy for four reasons. First, the energies are quantized, meaning that only discrete energy values (integer-plus-half multiples of \"\u0127\u03c9\") are possible; this is a general feature of quantum-mechanical systems when a particle is confined. Second, these discrete energy levels are equally spaced, unlike in the Bohr model of the atom, or the particle in a box. Third, the lowest achievable energy (the energy of the \"n\" = 0 state, called the ground state) is not equal to the minimum of the potential well, but \"\u0127\u03c9\"/2 above it; this is called zero-point energy. Because of the zero-point energy, the position and momentum of the oscillator in the ground state are not fixed (as they would be in a classical oscillator), but have a small range of variance, in accordance with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Fourth, the energy levels are nondegenerate implying that every eigenvalue is associated with only one solution (state).\nThe ground state probability density is concentrated at the origin, which means the particle spends most of its time at the bottom of the potential well, as one would expect for a state with little energy. As the energy increases, the probability density peaks at the classical \"turning points\", where the state's energy coincides with the potential energy. (See the discussion below of the highly excited states.) This is consistent with the classical harmonic oscillator, in which the particle spends more of its time (and is therefore more likely to be found) near the turning points, where it is moving the slowest. The correspondence principle is thus satisfied. Moreover, special nondispersive wave packets, with minimum uncertainty, called coherent states oscillate very much like classical objects, as illustrated in the figure; they are \"not\" eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.\nLadder operator method.\nThe \"ladder operator\" method, developed by Paul Dirac, allows extraction of the energy eigenvalues without directly solving the differential equation. It is generalizable to more complicated problems, notably in quantum field theory. Following this approach, we define the operators formula_9 and its adjoint formula_10,\nformula_11Note these operators classically are exactly the generators of normalized rotation in the phase space of formula_12 and formula_13, \"i.e\" they describe the forwards and backwards evolution in time of a classical harmonic oscillator.\nThese operators lead to the following representation of formula_14 and formula_15,\nformula_16\nThe operator a is not Hermitian, since itself and its adjoint \"a\"\u2020 are not equal. The energy eigenstates , when operated on by these ladder operators, give\nformula_17\nFrom the relations above, we can also define a number operator N, which has the following property:\nformula_18\nThe following commutators can be easily obtained by substituting the canonical commutation relation,\nformula_19\nand the Hamilton operator can be expressed as\nformula_20\nso the eigenstates of formula_21 are also the eigenstates of energy.\nTo see that, we can apply formula_22 to a number state formula_23:\nformula_24\nUsing the property of the number operator formula_25:\nformula_26\nwe get:\nformula_27\nThus, since formula_23 solves the TISE for the Hamiltonian operator formula_22, is also one of its eigenstates with the corresponding eigenvalue:\nformula_30\nQED.\nThe commutation property yields\nformula_31\nand similarly,\nformula_32\nThis means that formula_9 acts on formula_23 to produce, up to a multiplicative constant, formula_35, and formula_10 acts on formula_23 to produce formula_38. For this reason, formula_9 is called an annihilation operator (\"lowering operator\"), and formula_10 a creation operator (\"raising operator\"). The two operators together are called ladder operators. \nGiven any energy eigenstate, we can act on it with the lowering operator, a, to produce another eigenstate with \"\u0127\u03c9\" less energy. By repeated application of the lowering operator, it seems that we can produce energy eigenstates down to \"E\" = \u2212\u221e. However, since\nformula_41\nthe smallest eigenvalue of the number operator is 0, and\nformula_42\nIn this case, subsequent applications of the lowering operator will just produce zero, instead of additional energy eigenstates. Furthermore, we have shown above that\nformula_43\nFinally, by acting on |0\u27e9 with the raising operator and multiplying by suitable normalization factors, we can produce an infinite set of energy eigenstates \nformula_44\nsuch that\nformula_45\nwhich matches the energy spectrum given in the preceding section.\nArbitrary eigenstates can be expressed in terms of |0\u27e9,\nformula_46\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_proof/styles.css\" /&gt;Proof\naa^\\dagger\n a^\\dagger \\left| n - 1 \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n(n - 1)}} \\left(a^\\dagger\\right)^2 \\left| n - 2 \\right\\rangle = \\cdots = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n!}} \\left(a^\\dagger\\right)^n \\left|0\\right\\rangle.\nAnalytical questions.\nThe preceding analysis is algebraic, using only the commutation relations between the raising and lowering operators. Once the algebraic analysis is complete, one should turn to analytical questions. First, one should find the ground state, that is, the solution of the equation formula_47. In the position representation, this is the first-order differential equation\nformula_48\nwhose solution is easily found to be the Gaussian\nformula_49\nConceptually, it is important that there is only one solution of this equation; if there were, say, two linearly independent ground states, we would get two independent chains of eigenvectors for the harmonic oscillator. Once the ground state is computed, one can show inductively that the excited states are Hermite polynomials times the Gaussian ground state, using the explicit form of the raising operator in the position representation. One can also prove that, as expected from the uniqueness of the ground state, the Hermite functions energy eigenstates formula_50 constructed by the ladder method form a \"complete\" orthonormal set of functions.\nExplicitly connecting with the previous section, the ground state |0\u27e9 in the position representation is determined by formula_51,\nformula_52\nformula_53\nhence\nformula_54\nso that formula_55, and so on.\nNatural length and energy scales.\nThe quantum harmonic oscillator possesses natural scales for length and energy, which can be used to simplify the problem. These can be found by nondimensionalization.\nThe result is that, if \"energy\" is measured in units of \"\u0127\u03c9\" and \"distance\" in units of , then the Hamiltonian simplifies to\nformula_56\nwhile the energy eigenfunctions and eigenvalues simplify to Hermite functions and integers offset by a half,\nformula_57\nformula_58\nwhere \"H\"\"n\"(\"x\") are the Hermite polynomials.\nTo avoid confusion, these \"natural units\" will mostly not be adopted in this article. However, they frequently come in handy when performing calculations, by bypassing clutter.\nFor example, the fundamental solution () of \"H\" \u2212 \"i\u2202t\", the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger operator for this oscillator, simply boils down to the Mehler kernel,\nformula_59\nwhere \"K\"(\"x\",\"y\";0) = \"\u03b4\"(\"x\" \u2212 \"y\"). The most general solution for a given initial configuration \"\u03c8\"(\"x\",0) then is simply\nformula_60\nCoherent states.\nThe coherent states (also known as Glauber states) of the harmonic oscillator are special nondispersive wave packets, with minimum uncertainty \"\u03c3x\" \"\u03c3p\" = &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;\"\u210f\"\u20442, whose observables' expectation values evolve like a classical system. They are eigenvectors of the annihilation operator, \"not\" the Hamiltonian, and form an overcomplete basis which consequentially lacks orthogonality.\nThe coherent states are indexed by formula_61 and expressed in the basis as\nformula_62\nSince coherent states are not energy eigenstates, their time evolution is not a simple shift in wavefunction phase. The time-evolved states are, however, also coherent states but with phase-shifting parameter \u03b1 instead: formula_63.formula_64\nBecause formula_65 and via the Kermack-McCrae identity, the last form is equivalent to a unitary displacement operator acting on the ground state: formula_66. Calculating the expectation values:\nformula_67\nformula_68\nwhere formula_69 is the phase contributed by complex \u03b1. These equations confirm the oscillating behavior of the particle. \nThe uncertainties calculated using the numeric method are:\nformula_70\nformula_71\nwhich gives formula_72. Since the only wavefunction that can have lowest position-momentum uncertainty, formula_73, is a gaussian wavefunction, and since the coherent state wavefunction has minimum position-momentum uncertainty, we note that the general gaussian wavefunction in quantum mechanics has the form:formula_74Substituting the expectation values as a function of time, gives the required time varying wavefunction.\nThe probability of each energy eigenstates can be calculated to find the energy distribution of the wavefunction:\nformula_75\nwhich corresponds to Poisson distribution.\nHighly excited states.\nWhen n is large, the eigenstates are localized into the classical allowed region, that is, the region in which a classical particle with energy \"E\"\"n\" can move. The eigenstates are peaked near the turning points: the points at the ends of the classically allowed region where the classical particle changes direction. This phenomenon can be verified through asymptotics of the Hermite polynomials, and also through the WKB approximation. \nThe frequency of oscillation at x is proportional to the momentum \"p\"(\"x\") of a classical particle of energy \"E\"\"n\" and position x. Furthermore, the square of the amplitude (determining the probability density) is \"inversely\" proportional to \"p\"(\"x\"), reflecting the length of time the classical particle spends near x. The system behavior in a small neighborhood of the turning point does not have a simple classical explanation, but can be modeled using an Airy function. Using properties of the Airy function, one may estimate the probability of finding the particle outside the classically allowed region, to be approximately \nformula_76\nThis is also given, asymptotically, by the integral \nformula_77\nPhase space solutions.\nIn the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics, eigenstates of the quantum harmonic oscillator in several different representations of the quasiprobability distribution can be written in closed form. The most widely used of these is for the Wigner quasiprobability distribution.\nThe Wigner quasiprobability distribution for the energy eigenstate |\"n\"\u27e9 is, in the natural units described above,\nformula_78\nwhere \"Ln\" are the Laguerre polynomials. This example illustrates how the Hermite and Laguerre polynomials are linked through the Wigner map.\nMeanwhile, the Husimi Q function of the harmonic oscillator eigenstates have an even simpler form. If we work in the natural units described above, we have\nformula_79\nThis claim can be verified using the Segal\u2013Bargmann transform. Specifically, since the raising operator in the Segal\u2013Bargmann representation is simply multiplication by formula_80 and the ground state is the constant function 1, the normalized harmonic oscillator states in this representation are simply formula_81 . At this point, we can appeal to the formula for the Husimi Q function in terms of the Segal\u2013Bargmann transform.\nTwo-dimensional harmonic oscillators.\nThe two-dimensional Cartesian harmonic oscillator and the two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator in cylindrical coordinates have been treated in detail in the book of M\u00fcller-Kirsten.\n\"N\"-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.\nThe one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is readily generalizable to \"N\" dimensions, where \"N\" = 1, 2, 3, ... In one dimension, the position of the particle was specified by a single coordinate, \"x\". In \"N\" dimensions, this is replaced by \"N\" position coordinates, which we label \"x\"1, ..., \"x\"\"N\". Corresponding to each position coordinate is a momentum; we label these \"p\"1, ..., \"p\"\"N\". The canonical commutation relations between these operators are\nformula_82\nThe Hamiltonian for this system is\nformula_83\nAs the form of this Hamiltonian makes clear, the \"N\"-dimensional harmonic oscillator is exactly analogous to \"N\" independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators with the same mass and spring constant. In this case, the quantities \"x\"1, ..., \"x\"\"N\" would refer to the positions of each of the \"N\" particles. This is a convenient property of the \"r\"2 potential, which allows the potential energy to be separated into terms depending on one coordinate each.\nThis observation makes the solution straightforward. For a particular set of quantum numbers formula_84 the energy eigenfunctions for the \"N\"-dimensional oscillator are expressed in terms of the 1-dimensional eigenfunctions as:\nformula_85\nIn the ladder operator method, we define \"N\" sets of ladder operators,\nformula_86\nBy an analogous procedure to the one-dimensional case, we can then show that each of the \"ai\" and \"a\"\u2020\"i\" operators lower and raise the energy by \"\u210f\u03c9\" respectively. The Hamiltonian is\nformula_87\nThis Hamiltonian is invariant under the dynamic symmetry group \"U\"(\"N\") (the unitary group in \"N\" dimensions), defined by\nformula_88\nwhere formula_89 is an element in the defining matrix representation of \"U\"(\"N\").\nThe energy levels of the system are\nformula_90\nformula_91\nAs in the one-dimensional case, the energy is quantized. The ground state energy is \"N\" times the one-dimensional ground energy, as we would expect using the analogy to \"N\" independent one-dimensional oscillators. There is one further difference: in the one-dimensional case, each energy level corresponds to a unique quantum state. In \"N\"-dimensions, except for the ground state, the energy levels are \"degenerate\", meaning there are several states with the same energy.\nThe degeneracy can be calculated relatively easily. As an example, consider the 3-dimensional case: Define \"n\" = \"n\"1 + \"n\"2 + \"n\"3. All states with the same \"n\" will have the same energy. For a given \"n\", we choose a particular \"n\"1. Then \"n\"2 + \"n\"3 = \"n\" \u2212 \"n\"1. There are \"n\" \u2212 \"n\"1 + 1 possible pairs {\"n\"2, \"n\"3}. \"n\"2 can take on the values 0 to \"n\" \u2212 \"n\"1, and for each \"n\"2 the value of \"n\"3 is fixed. The degree of degeneracy therefore is:\nformula_92\nFormula for general \"N\" and \"n\" [\"g\"\"n\" being the dimension of the symmetric irreducible \"n\"-th power representation of the unitary group \"U\"(\"N\")]:\nformula_93\nThe special case \"N\" = 3, given above, follows directly from this general equation. This is however, only true for distinguishable particles, i.e. in Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics (not in quantum statistics) or one particle in \"N\" dimensions (as dimensions are distinguishable). For the case of \"N\" bosons in a one-dimension harmonic trap, the degeneracy scales as the number of ways to partition an integer \"n\" using integers less than or equal to \"N\". It can be shown that the large-formula_94 asymptotic behavior of the degeneracy formula_95 is practically independent of the energy formula_94 - different from the classical case in which this diverges. This degeneracy is\nformula_97\nThis arises due to the constraint of putting \"N\" quanta into a state ket where formula_98 and formula_99, which are the same constraints as in integer partition.\nExample: 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a particle in a spherically-symmetric three-dimensional harmonic oscillator can be solved explicitly by separation of variables. This procedure is analogous to the separation performed in the hydrogen-like atom problem, but with a different spherically symmetric potential\nformula_100\nwhere \u03bc is the mass of the particle. Because m will be used below for the magnetic quantum number, mass is indicated by \u03bc, instead of m, as earlier in this article.\nThe solution to the equation is:\nformula_101\nwhere\nformula_102 is a normalization constant; formula_103;\nformula_104 \nare generalized Laguerre polynomials; The order k of the polynomial is a non-negative integer;\nThe energy eigenvalue is\nformula_107\nThe energy is usually described by the single quantum number\nformula_108\nBecause k is a non-negative integer, for every even n we have \"\u2113\" = 0, 2, ..., \"n\" \u2212 2, \"n\" and for every odd n we have \"\u2113\" = 1, 3, ..., \"n\" \u2212 2, \"n\" . The magnetic quantum number m is an integer satisfying \u2212\"\u2113\" \u2264 \"m\" \u2264 \"\u2113\", so for every n and \"\u2113\" there are 2\"\u2113\"\u00a0+\u00a01 different quantum states, labeled by m . Thus, the degeneracy at level n is\nformula_109\nwhere the sum starts from 0 or 1, according to whether n is even or odd.\nThis result is in accordance with the dimension formula above, and amounts to the dimensionality of a symmetric representation of SU(3), the relevant degeneracy group.\nApplications.\nHarmonic oscillators lattice: phonons.\nThe notation of a harmonic oscillator can be extended to a one-dimensional lattice of many particles. Consider a one-dimensional quantum mechanical \"harmonic chain\" of \"N\" identical atoms. This is the simplest quantum mechanical model of a lattice, and we will see how phonons arise from it. The formalism that we will develop for this model is readily generalizable to two and three dimensions.\nAs in the previous section, we denote the positions of the masses by \"x\"1, \"x\"2, ..., as measured from their equilibrium positions (i.e. \"xi\" = 0 if the particle i is at its equilibrium position). In two or more dimensions, the \"xi\" are vector quantities. The Hamiltonian for this system is\nformula_110\nwhere m is the (assumed uniform) mass of each atom, and \"xi\" and \"pi\" are the position and momentum operators for the \"i\" th atom and the sum is made over the nearest neighbors (nn). However, it is customary to rewrite the Hamiltonian in terms of the normal modes of the wavevector rather than in terms of the particle coordinates so that one can work in the more convenient Fourier space.\nWe introduce, then, a set of N \"normal coordinates\" \"Qk\", defined as the discrete Fourier transforms of the xs, and N \"conjugate momenta\" \u03a0 defined as the Fourier transforms of the ps,\nformula_111\nformula_112\nThe quantity \"kn\" will turn out to be the wave number of the phonon, i.e. 2\"\u03c0\" divided by the wavelength. It takes on quantized values, because the number of atoms is finite.\nThis preserves the desired commutation relations in either real space or wave vector space\nformula_113\nFrom the general result\nformula_114\nit is easy to show, through elementary trigonometry, that the potential energy term is\nformula_115\nwhere\nformula_116\nThe Hamiltonian may be written in wave vector space as\nformula_117\nNote that the couplings between the position variables have been transformed away; if the Qs and \u03a0s were hermitian (which they are not), the transformed Hamiltonian would describe N \"uncoupled\" harmonic oscillators.\nThe form of the quantization depends on the choice of boundary conditions; for simplicity, we impose \"periodic\" boundary conditions, defining the (\"N\" + 1)-th atom as equivalent to the first atom. Physically, this corresponds to joining the chain at its ends. The resulting quantization is\nformula_118\nThe upper bound to n comes from the minimum wavelength, which is twice the lattice spacing a, as discussed above.\nThe harmonic oscillator eigenvalues or energy levels for the mode \"\u03c9k\" are \nformula_119\nIf we ignore the zero-point energy then the levels are evenly spaced at \nformula_120\nSo an exact amount of energy \"\u0127\u03c9\", must be supplied to the harmonic oscillator lattice to push it to the next energy level. In analogy to the photon case when the electromagnetic field is quantised, the quantum of vibrational energy is called a phonon.\nAll quantum systems show wave-like and particle-like properties. The particle-like properties of the phonon are best understood using the methods of second quantization and operator techniques described elsewhere.\nIn the continuum limit, \"a\" \u2192 0, \"N\" \u2192 \u221e, while \"Na\" is held fixed. The canonical coordinates \"Qk\" devolve to the decoupled momentum modes of a scalar field, formula_121, whilst the location index i (\"not the displacement dynamical variable\") becomes the parameter x argument of the scalar field, formula_122.\nThe inverted harmonic oscillator.\nThe inverted harmonic oscillator has been investigated in detail by G. Barton. See also H.J.W. M\u00fcller-Kirsten and C. Yuce, A. Killen and A.

First established as early as 1625 on northwestern side of Hispaniola after the devastations of Osorio, their heyday was from the Restoration in 1660 until about 1688, during a time when governments in the Caribbean area were not strong enough to suppress them. Martinique was a home port for French buccaneers as well as pirates like Captain Crapeau.\nOriginally the name applied to the landless hunters of wild boars and cattle in the largely uninhabited areas of Tortuga and Hispaniola. The meat they caught was smoked over a slow fire in little huts the French called \"boucans\" to make \"viande boucan\u00e9e\" \u2013 \"jerked meat\" or \"jerky\" \u2013 which they sold to the corsairs who preyed on the (largely Spanish) shipping and settlements of the Caribbean. Eventually the term was applied to the corsairs and (later) privateers themselves, also known as the Brethren of the Coast. Although corsairs, also known as \"filibusters\" or \"freebooters\", were largely lawless, privateers were nominally licensed by the authorities \u2013 first the French, later the English and Dutch \u2013 to prey on the Spanish, until their depredations became so severe they were suppressed.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"buccaneer\" derives from the Caribbean Arawak word \"buccan\", which refers to a wooden frame on which Tainos and Caribs slowly roasted or smoked meat, commonly manatee. The word was adopted into French as \"boucan\", hence the name \"boucanier\" for French hunters who used such frames to smoke meat from feral cattle and pigs on the western part of Hispaniola after the devastations of Osorio. English colonists anglicised \"boucanier\" to \"buccaneer\".\nHistory.\nAbout 1630, French interlopers were driven away from the island of Hispaniola and fled to nearby Tortuga. French buccaneers were established on northern Hispaniola as early as 1625, but lived at first mostly as hunters rather than robbers; their transition to full-time piracy was gradual and motivated in part by Spanish efforts to wipe out both the buccaneers and the prey animals on which they depended. The buccaneers' migration from Hispaniola's mainland to the more defensible offshore island of Tortuga limited their resources and accelerated their piratical raids. According to Alexandre Exquemelin, the Tortuga buccaneer Pierre Le Grand pioneered the settlers' attacks on galleons making the return voyage to Spain. The Spaniards also tried to drive them out of Tortuga, but the buccaneers were joined by many more French, Dutch, and English adventurers who turned to piracy. They set their eyes on Spanish shipping, generally using small craft to attack galleons in the vicinity of the Windward Passage. With the support and encouragement of rival European powers, they became strong enough to sail for the mainland of Spanish America, known as the Spanish Main, and sacked cities.\nPerhaps what distinguished the buccaneers from earlier Caribbean sailors was their use of permanent bases in the West Indies. During the mid 17th century, the Bahama Islands attracted many lawless people who had taken over New Providence. Encouraged by its large harbour, they were joined by several pirates who made their living by raiding the Spanish on the coast of Cuba. They called this activity buccaneering. Their principal station was Tortuga, but from time to time they seized other strongholds, like Providence, and they were welcomed with their booty in ports like Port Royal in Jamaica. At first they were international. In 1663 it was estimated that there were fifteen of their ships with nearly a thousand men, English, French, and Dutch, belonging to Jamaica and Tortuga. As time went on and the European governments asserted their authority, the buccaneers first became separated by nationalities and then in time were suppressed altogether, leaving behind only dispersed bands of pirates.\nThe French buccaneers and settlers from Paris established a settlement which has now occupied Martinique, the French word for \"buccaneer\" was \"boucanier,\" which directly relates to the island as the term originates from the Caribbean Arawak word \"buccan,\" especially for the French pirates like \u00c9tienne de Montauban and Mathurin Desmarestz.\nEnglish settlers occupying Jamaica began to spread the name \"buccaneers\" with the meaning of pirates. The name became universally adopted later in 1684 when the first English translation of Alexandre Exquemelin's book \"The Buccaneers of America\" was published.\nViewed from London, buccaneering was a budget way to wage war on England's rival, Spain. The English crown licensed buccaneers with letters of marque, legalising their operations in return for a share of their profits. The buccaneers were invited by Jamaica's Governor Thomas Modyford to base ships at Port Royal. The buccaneers robbed Spanish shipping and colonies, and returned to Port Royal with their plunder, making the city the most prosperous in the Caribbean. There were even Royal Navy officers sent to lead the buccaneers, such as Christopher Myngs. Their activities went on irrespective of whether England happened to be at war with Spain or France.\nAmong the leaders of the buccaneers were two Frenchmen, Jean-David Nau, better known as Fran\u00e7ois l'Ollonais, and Daniel Montbars, who destroyed so many Spanish ships and killed so many Spaniards that he was called \"the Exterminator\".\nAnother noted leader was Welshman Henry Morgan, who sacked Maracaibo, Portobello, and Panama City, stealing a huge amount from the Spanish. Morgan became rich and went back to England, where he was knighted by Charles II.\nWhile the buccaneers were powerful it was not only hostility to Spain, but also lack of authority, that prevented the other states from ending the old state of affairs in which, even when they were at peace with Spain and Portugal in Europe, there was 'no peace beyond the Line'. The West Indies were beyond the range of the European international system. Sometimes this was for their advantage but on the whole, with the intermingled possessions, trade rivalries, and disputes about territorial rights, the local conditions led to conflicts. The West Indies continued to be one of the centres of international strife throughout the eighteenth century although by that time it was regulated in the same way as in Europe, and had become inseparable from the European wars.\nDuring the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1665, de Ruyter attacked Barbados with a strong squadron, and the English had no choice but to base their defence on the buccaneers whom the governor of Jamaica had previously been trying to suppress. They were unmanageable and destroyed where they conquered, but they mastered the Dutch colonies of St. Eustatius and Tobago. In 1666, however, when the French joined the Dutch in the war, the weakness of this policy was proved. The English hoped to capture the French plantations of St. Kitts, where there were new settlers of both nations, and so they declined to make a new agreement for neutrality. They made what was intended to be a surprise attack, but was an ignominious failure, and the English settlers in the island had to surrender unconditionally. More than 8,000 of them were shipped away, and their property was seized by the French. Lord Willoughby, the able governor of Barbados, got together an expedition for a counter-stroke, but his fleet was broken up by a hurricane in which he perished. The French captured one island after another. In 1667 naval ships from England regained the command of the sea and made various conquests, but the Peace of Breda re-established the status quo in March of that year.\nHenry Morgan was knighted in 1674 and became lieutenant-governor of Jamaica. In the late 1670s there was a succession of raids on Spanish ports. In 1680 a party made its way across the Isthmus of Panama and, sailing in captured Spanish ships, pillaged the coasts and commerce of the Pacific. They had not been long on their journey when the Anglo-Spanish treaty of 1680 was signed, which at last stipulated for a real peace beyond the Line and indirectly recognised the right of the English to trade in West Indian waters. When the buccaneers returned by way of Cape Horn in 1682, the survivors found themselves treated as pirates. The French, within a very few years, also controlled their buccaneers, and in the Nine Years' War (1688-1697) they were no longer an important factor. Until about 1688 the governments were not strong enough, and did not consistently attempt, to suppress the buccaneers.\nIn January 1684, Havana responded to the attacks by the buccaneers of the Bahamas in the event known as the Raid on Charles Town.\nIn the 1690s, the old buccaneering ways began to die out, as European governments began to discard the policy of \"no peace beyond the Line\". Buccaneers were hard to control; some even embroiled their colonies in unwanted wars. Notably, at the 1697 joint French-buccaneer siege of Cartagena, led by Bernard Desjean, Baron de Pointis, the buccaneers and the French regulars parted on extremely bitter terms. Less tolerated by local Caribbean officials, buccaneers increasingly turned to legal work or else joined regular pirate crews who sought plunder in the Indian Ocean, the east coast of North America, or West Africa as well as in the Caribbean.\nLegal status.\nSometimes the buccaneers held more or less regular commissions as privateers, and they always preyed upon the Spaniards; but often they became mere pirates and plundered any nation. As a rule, the buccaneers called themselves privateers, and many sailed under the protection of a letter of marque granted by British, French or Dutch authorities. For example, Henry Morgan had some form of legal cover for all of his attacks, and expressed great indignation at being called a \"corsair\" by the governor of Panama. Nevertheless, these rough men had little concern for legal niceties, and exploited every opportunity to pillage Spanish targets, whether or not a letter of marque was available. Many of the letters of marque used by buccaneers were legally invalid, and any form of legal paper in that illiterate age might be passed off as a letter of marque. Furthermore, even those buccaneers who had valid letters of marque often failed to observe their terms. The legal status of buccaneers was still further obscured by the practice of the Spanish authorities, who regarded them as heretics and interlopers, and thus hanged or garroted captured buccaneers entirely without regard to whether their attacks were licensed by French or English monarchs.\nSimultaneously, French and English governors tended to turn a blind eye to the buccaneers' depredations against the Spanish, even when unlicensed. But as Spanish power waned toward the end of the 17th century, the buccaneers' attacks began to disrupt France and England's merchant traffic with Spanish America, such that merchants who had previously regarded the buccaneers as a defence against Spain now saw them as a threat to commerce, and colonial authorities grew hostile. This change in political atmosphere, more than anything else, put an end to buccaneering.\nLifestyle.\nA hundred years before the French Revolution, the buccaneer companies were run on lines in which liberty, equality and fraternity were the rule. In a buccaneer camp, the captain was elected and could be deposed by the votes of the crew. The crew, and not the captain, decided whether to attack a particular ship, or a fleet of ships. Spoils were evenly divided into shares; the captain received an agreed amount for the ship, plus a portion of the share of the prize money, usually five or six shares.\nCrews generally had no regular wages, being paid only from their shares of the plunder, a system called \"no purchase, no pay\" by Modyford or \"no prey, no pay\" by Enqueueing. There was a strong \"esprit\" among buccaneers. This, combined with overwhelming numbers, allowed them to win battles and raids. There was also, for some time, a social insurance system guaranteeing compensation for battle wounds at a worked-out scale.\nWarfare.\nNaval.\nBuccaneers initially used small boats to attack Spanish galleons surreptitiously, often at night, and climb aboard before the alarm could be raised. Buccaneers were expert marksmen and would quickly kill the helmsman and any officers aboard. Buccaneers' reputation as cruel pirates grew to the point that, eventually, most victims would surrender, hoping they would not be killed.\nLand.\nWhen buccaneers raided towns, they did not sail into port and bombard the defences, as naval forces typically did. Instead, they secretly beached their ships out of sight of their target, marched overland, and attacked the towns from the landward side, which was usually less fortified. Their raids relied mainly on surprise and speed. The sack of Campeche was considered the first such raid and many others that followed replicated the same techniques including the attack on Veracruz in 1683 and the raid on Cartagena later that same year.\nDownturn.\nSpanish authorities always viewed buccaneers as trespassers and a threat to their hegemony in the Caribbean basin, and over the second half of the 17th century, other European powers learned to perceive them in the same way. These new powers had appropriated and secured territories in the area and needed to protect them. Buccaneers who did not settle down on agriculture or some other acceptable business after the so-called Golden Age of Piracy proved a nuisance to them, too. Spanish anti-pirate practices became thus a model for all recently arrived colonial governments. Some expanded them.\nPunishments.\nWhen caught by anti-pirate English authorities, 17th and 18th century buccaneers received justice in a summary fashion, and many ended their lives by \"dancing the hempen jig\", a euphemism for hanging. Public executions were a form of entertainment, and people came out to watch them as they would for a sporting event today. Newspapers reported details such as condemned men's last words, the prayers said by the priests, and descriptions of their final moments in the gallows. In England, most executions took place at Execution Dock on the River Thames in London.\nIn the cases of more famous prisoners, usually captains, their punishments extended beyond death. Their bodies were enclosed in iron cages (for which they were measured before their execution) and left to swing in the air until the flesh rotted off them\u2014a process that could take as long as two years. The bodies of captains such as William \"Captain\" Kidd, Charles Vane, William Fly, and John Rackham were all treated this way.\nIt is doubtful many buccaneers got off with just a time in the pillory. However, a pirate who was flogged could very well spend some time in the pillory after being beaten. \"The most common shaming punishment was confinement in the pillory often with symbols of their crimes.\"\nIn literature.\nAfter the threat began to abate, literature brought buccaneers to glory as example of virility and self-reliance. Daniel Defoe\u2019s works like \"Robinson Crusoe\" (1719), \"Captain Singleton\" (1720), and \"A General History of the Pyrates\" (1724) (purportedly written by Defoe) set the tone for the glamorous ways in which later generations would perceive them.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901.\nBorn in Paris, Prudhomme originally studied to be an engineer, but turned to philosophy and later to poetry; he declared it as his intention to create scientific poetry for modern times. In character sincere and melancholic, he was linked to the Parnassus school, although, at the same time, his work displays characteristics of its own.\nEarly life.\nPrudhomme's parents were M. Sully Prudhomme and Clotilde Caillat. They had been engaged for 10 years before they had felt financially able to marry. When Prudhomme was two, his father, a shopkeeper, died. His mother and he relocated to Prudhomme's uncle's house. Prudhomme joined his father's name \"Sully\" with his surname Prudhomme, becoming Sully-Prudhomme. He was interested in classic literature and mathematics in school. He also considered entering the Dominican order, but decided against it.\nPrudhomme attended the Lyc\u00e9e Bonaparte, but eye trouble interrupted his studies. He worked for a while in the Creusot region for the Schneider steel foundry, and then began studying law in a notary's office. The favourable reception of his early poems by the \"Conf\u00e9rence La Bruy\u00e8re\" (a student society) encouraged him to begin a literary career.\nWriting.\nHis first collection, \"Stances et Po\u00e8mes\" (\"Stanzas and Poems\", 1865), was praised by Sainte-Beuve. It included his most famous poem, \"Le vase bris\u00e9\". He published more poetry before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. This war, which he discussed in \"Impressions de la guerre\" (1872) and \"La France\" (1874), permanently damaged his health.\nDuring his career, Prudhomme gradually shifted from the sentimental style of his first books towards a more personal style which unified the formality of the Parnassus school with his interest in philosophical and scientific subjects. One of his inspirations was clearly Lucretius's \"De rerum natura\", whose first book he translated into verse. His philosophy was expressed in \"La Justice\" (1878) and \"Le Bonheur\" (1888). The extreme economy of means employed in these poems has, however, usually been judged as compromising their poetical quality without advancing their claims as works of philosophy. He was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1881. Another distinction, \"Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur\", was to follow in 1895.\nAfter \"Le Bonheur\", Prudhomme turned from poetry to write essays on aesthetics and philosophy. He published two important essays: \"L'Expression dans les beaux-arts\" (1884) and \"R\u00e9flexions sur l'art des vers\" (1892), a series of articles on Blaise Pascal in \"La Revue des Deux Mondes\" (1890), and an article on free will (\"La Psychologie du Libre-Arbitre\", 1906) in the \"Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale\".\nNobel Prize.\nThe first writer to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature (given \"in special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of lofty idealism, artistic perfection and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect\"), he devoted the bulk of the money he received to the creation of a poetry prize awarded by the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des gens de lettres\". He also founded, in 1902, the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des po\u00e8tes fran\u00e7ais\" with Jose-Maria de Heredia and Leon Dierx.\nDeath.\nAt the end of his life, his poor health (which had troubled him ever since 1870) forced him to live almost as a recluse at Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry, suffering attacks of paralysis while continuing to work on essays. He died suddenly on 6 September 1907, and was buried at P\u00e8re-Lachaise in Paris.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The different notions of convergence capture different properties about the sequence, with some notions of convergence being stronger than others. For example, convergence in distribution tells us about the limit distribution of a sequence of random variables. This is a weaker notion than convergence in probability, which tells us about the value a random variable will take, rather than just the distribution.\nThe concept is important in probability theory, and its applications to statistics and stochastic processes. The same concepts are known in more general mathematics as stochastic convergence and they formalize the idea that certain properties of a sequence of essentially random or unpredictable events can sometimes be expected to settle down into a behavior that is essentially unchanging when items far enough into the sequence are studied. The different possible notions of convergence relate to how such a behavior can be characterized: two readily understood behaviors are that the sequence eventually takes a constant value, and that values in the sequence continue to change but can be described by an unchanging probability distribution.\nBackground.\n\"Stochastic convergence\" formalizes the idea that a sequence of essentially random or unpredictable events can sometimes be expected to settle into a pattern. The pattern may for instance be\nSome less obvious, more theoretical patterns could be\nThese other types of patterns that may arise are reflected in the different types of stochastic convergence that have been studied.\nWhile the above discussion has related to the convergence of a single series to a limiting value, the notion of the convergence of two series towards each other is also important, but this is easily handled by studying the sequence defined as either the difference or the ratio of the two series.\nFor example, if the average of \"n\" independent random variables formula_1, all having the same finite mean and variance, is given by\nformula_2\nthen as formula_3 tends to infinity, formula_4 converges \"in probability\" (see below) to the common mean, formula_5, of the random variables formula_6. This result is known as the weak law of large numbers. Other forms of convergence are important in other useful theorems, including the central limit theorem.\nThroughout the following, we assume that formula_7 is a sequence of random variables, and formula_8 is a random variable, and all of them are defined on the same probability space formula_9.\nConvergence in distribution.\n | header5 = Graphic example\n | data6 = Suppose {\"Xi\"} is an iid sequence of uniform \"U\"(\u22121, 1) random variables. Let formula_10 be their (normalized) sums. Then according to the central limit theorem, the distribution of Zn approaches the normal \"N\"(0, ) distribution. This convergence is shown in the picture: as n grows larger, the shape of the probability density function gets closer and closer to the Gaussian curve.\nLoosely, with this mode of convergence, we increasingly expect to see the next outcome in a sequence of random experiments becoming better and better modeled by a given probability distribution. More precisely, the distribution of the associated random variable in the sequence becomes arbitrarily close to a specified fixed distribution.\nConvergence in distribution is the weakest form of convergence typically discussed, since it is implied by all other types of convergence mentioned in this article. However, convergence in distribution is very frequently used in practice; most often it arises from application of the central limit theorem.\nDefinition.\nA sequence formula_11 of real-valued random variables, with cumulative distribution functions formula_12, is said to converge in distribution, or converge weakly, or converge in law to a random variable X with cumulative distribution function F if\n formula_13\nfor every number formula_14 at which formula_15 is continuous.\nThe requirement that only the continuity points of formula_15 should be considered is essential. For example, if formula_4 are distributed uniformly on intervals formula_18, then this sequence converges in distribution to the degenerate random variable formula_19. Indeed, formula_20 for all formula_21 when formula_22, and formula_23 for all formula_24when formula_25. However, for this limiting random variable formula_26, even though formula_27 for all formula_3. Thus the convergence of cdfs fails at the point formula_29 where formula_30 is discontinuous.\nConvergence in distribution may be denoted as\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\\ X,\\ \\ \n X_n \\ \\xrightarrow{\\mathcal{L}}\\ X,\\ \\ \n X_n \\ \\xrightarrow{d}\\ \\mathcal{L}_X, \\\\\n &amp; X_n \\rightsquigarrow X,\\ \\ \n X_n \\Rightarrow X,\\ \\ \n \\mathcal{L}(X_n)\\to\\mathcal{L}(X),\\\\ \n \\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;\nwhere formula_31 is the law (probability distribution) of X. For example, if X is standard normal we can write formula_32.\nFor random vectors formula_33 the convergence in distribution is defined similarly. We say that this sequence converges in distribution to a random k-vector X if\n formula_34\nfor every formula_35 which is a continuity set of X.\nThe definition of convergence in distribution may be extended from random vectors to more general random elements in arbitrary metric spaces, and even to the \u201crandom variables\u201d which are not measurable \u2014 a situation which occurs for example in the study of empirical processes. This is the \u201cweak convergence of laws without laws being defined\u201d \u2014 except asymptotically.\nIn this case the term weak convergence is preferable (see weak convergence of measures), and we say that a sequence of random elements {\"Xn\"} converges weakly to X (denoted as \"Xn\" \u21d2 \"X\") if\n formula_36\nfor all continuous bounded functions h. Here E* denotes the \"outer expectation\", that is the expectation of a \u201csmallest measurable function g that dominates \"h\"(\"Xn\")\u201d.\nProperties.\n (1 + cos(2\"\u03c0nx\"))1(0,1). These random variables converge in distribution to a uniform \"U\"(0,\u20091), whereas their densities do not converge at all.\nConvergence in probability.\nThe basic idea behind this type of convergence is that the probability of an \u201cunusual\u201d outcome becomes smaller and smaller as the sequence progresses.\nThe concept of convergence in probability is used very often in statistics. For example, an estimator is called consistent if it converges in probability to the quantity being estimated. Convergence in probability is also the type of convergence established by the weak law of large numbers.\nDefinition.\nA sequence {\"X\"\"n\"} of random variables converges in probability towards the random variable \"X\" if for all \"\u03b5\" &gt; 0\n formula_58\nMore explicitly, let \"P\"\"n\"(\"\u03b5\") be the probability that \"X\"\"n\" is outside the ball of radius \"\u03b5\" centered at\u00a0\"X\". Then Xn is said to converge in probability to \"X\" if for any \"\u03b5\" &gt; 0 and any \"\u03b4\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a00 there exists a number \"N\" (which may depend on \"\u03b5\" and \"\u03b4\") such that for all \"n\"\u00a0\u2265\u00a0\"N\", \"P\"\"n\"(\"\u03b5\")\u00a0&lt;\u00a0\"\u03b4\" (the definition of limit).\nNotice that for the condition to be satisfied, it is not possible that for each \"n\" the random variables \"X\" and \"X\"\"n\" are independent (and thus convergence in probability is a condition on the joint cdf's, as opposed to convergence in distribution, which is a condition on the individual cdf's), unless \"X\" is deterministic like for the weak law of large numbers. At the same time, the case of a deterministic \"X\" cannot, whenever the deterministic value is a discontinuity point (not isolated), be handled by convergence in distribution, where discontinuity points have to be explicitly excluded.\nConvergence in probability is denoted by adding the letter \"p\" over an arrow indicating convergence, or using the \"plim\" probability limit operator:\nFor random elements {\"X\"\"n\"} on a separable metric space (\"S\", \"d\"), convergence in probability is defined similarly by\n formula_59\nCounterexamples.\nNot every sequence of random variables which converges to another random variable in distribution also converges in probability to that random variable. As an example, consider a sequence of standard normal random variables formula_64 and a second sequence formula_65. Notice that the distribution of formula_66 is equal to the distribution of formula_64 for all formula_68, but:\nformula_69\nwhich does not converge to formula_70. So we do not have convergence in probability.\nAlmost sure convergence.\nThis is the type of stochastic convergence that is most similar to pointwise convergence known from elementary real analysis.\nDefinition.\nTo say that the sequence Xn converges almost surely or almost everywhere or with probability 1 or strongly towards \"X\" means that\nformula_71\nThis means that the values of Xn approach the value of \"X\", in the sense that events for which Xn does not converge to \"X\" have probability 0 (see \"Almost surely\"). Using the probability space formula_9 and the concept of the random variable as a function from \u03a9 to R, this is equivalent to the statement\nformula_73\nUsing the notion of the , almost sure convergence can also be defined as follows:\nformula_74\nAlmost sure convergence is often denoted by adding the letters \"a.s.\" over an arrow indicating convergence:\nFor generic random elements {\"Xn\"} on a metric space formula_75, convergence almost surely is defined similarly:\nformula_76\nCounterexamples.\nConsider a sequence formula_77 of independent random variables such that formula_78 and formula_79. For formula_80 we have formula_81 which converges to formula_70 hence formula_83 in probability.\nSince formula_84 and the events formula_85 are independent, second Borel Cantelli Lemma ensures that formula_86 hence the sequence formula_77 does not converge to formula_70 almost everywhere (in fact the set on which this sequence does not converge to formula_70 has probability formula_90).\nSure convergence or pointwise convergence.\nTo say that the sequence of random variables (\"X\"\"n\") defined over the same probability space (i.e., a random process) converges surely or everywhere or pointwise towards \"X\" means\nformula_91\nwhere \u03a9 is the sample space of the underlying probability space over which the random variables are defined.\nThis is the notion of pointwise convergence of a sequence of functions extended to a sequence of random variables. (Note that random variables themselves are functions).\nformula_92\nSure convergence of a random variable implies all the other kinds of convergence stated above, but there is no payoff in probability theory by using sure convergence compared to using almost sure convergence. The difference between the two only exists on sets with probability zero. This is why the concept of sure convergence of random variables is very rarely used.\nConvergence in mean.\nGiven a real number \"r\" \u2265 1, we say that the sequence Xn converges in the \"r\"-th mean (or in the \"Lr\"-norm) towards the random variable \"X\", if the r-th absolute moments formula_42(|\"Xn\"|\"r \") and formula_42(|\"X\"|\"r \") of Xn and \"X\" exist, and\n formula_95\nwhere the operator E denotes the expected value. Convergence in r-th mean tells us that the expectation of the r-th power of the difference between formula_64 and formula_53 converges to zero.\nThis type of convergence is often denoted by adding the letter \"Lr\" over an arrow indicating convergence:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe most important cases of convergence in \"r\"-th mean are:\nConvergence in the \"r\"-th mean, for \"r\" \u2265 1, implies convergence in probability (by Markov's inequality). Furthermore, if \"r\" &gt; \"s\" \u2265 1, convergence in \"r\"-th mean implies convergence in \"s\"-th mean. Hence, convergence in mean square implies convergence in mean.\nAdditionally, \n formula_98\nThe converse is not necessarily true, however it is true if formula_99 (by a more general version of Scheff\u00e9's lemma).\nProperties.\nProvided the probability space is complete:\nThe chain of implications between the various notions of convergence are noted in their respective sections. They are, using the arrow notation:\n formula_120\nThese properties, together with a number of other special cases, are summarized in the following list:\n 1 for all \"n\" and some \"b\", then Xn converges in \"r\"th mean to \"X\" for all \"r\" \u2265 1. In other words, if Xn converges in probability to \"X\" and all random variables Xn are almost surely bounded above and below, then Xn converges to \"X\" also in any \"r\"th mean.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt; X \\\\\n |X_n| &lt; Y \\\\\n \\mathbb{E}[Y] &lt; \\infty \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"This article incorporates material from the Citizendium article \"\", which is licensed under the but not under the .\""}

For example, EVA might be used in the field of hydrology to estimate the probability of an unusually large flooding event, such as the 100-year flood. Similarly, for the design of a breakwater, a coastal engineer would seek to estimate the 50\u00a0year wave and design the structure accordingly.\nData analysis.\nTwo main approaches exist for practical extreme value analysis.\nThe first method relies on deriving block maxima (minima) series as a preliminary step. In many situations it is customary and convenient to extract the annual maxima (minima), generating an \"annual maxima series\" (AMS).\nThe second method relies on extracting, from a continuous record, the peak values reached for any period during which values exceed a certain threshold (falls below a certain threshold). This method is generally referred to as the \"peak over threshold\" method (POT).\nFor AMS data, the analysis may partly rely on the results of the Fisher\u2013Tippett\u2013Gnedenko theorem, leading to the generalized extreme value distribution being selected for fitting. However, in practice, various procedures are applied to select between a wider range of distributions. The theorem here relates to the limiting distributions for the minimum or the maximum of a very large collection of independent random variables from the same distribution. Given that the number of relevant random events within a year may be rather limited, it is unsurprising that analyses of observed AMS data often lead to distributions other than the \"generalized extreme value distribution\" (GEVD) being selected.\nFor POT data, the analysis may involve fitting two distributions: One for the number of events in a time period considered and a second for the size of the exceedances.\nA common assumption for the first is the Poisson distribution, with the generalized Pareto distribution being used for the exceedances. \nA tail-fitting can be based on the Pickands\u2013Balkema\u2013de Haan theorem.\nNovak (2011) reserves the term \"POT method\" to the case where the threshold is non-random, and distinguishes it from the case where one deals with exceedances of a random threshold.\nApplications.\nApplications of extreme value theory include predicting the probability distribution of:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHistory.\nThe field of extreme value theory was pioneered by L. Tippett (1902\u20131985). Tippett was employed by the British Cotton Industry Research Association, where he worked to make cotton thread stronger. In his studies, he realized that the strength of a thread was controlled by the strength of its weakest fibres. With the help of R.A. Fisher, Tippet obtained three asymptotic limits describing the distributions of extremes assuming independent variables. E.J. Gumbel (1958) codified this theory. These results can be extended to allow for slight correlations between variables, but the classical theory does not extend to strong correlations of the order of the variance. One universality class of particular interest is that of \"log-correlated\" fields, where the correlations decay logarithmically with the distance.\nUnivariate theory.\nThe theory for extreme values of a single variable is governed by the \"extreme value theorem\", also called the \"Fisher\u2013Tippett\u2013Gnedenko theorem\", which describes which of the three possible distributions for extreme values applies for a particular statistical variable formula_1.\nMultivariate theory.\nExtreme value theory in more than one variable introduces additional issues that have to be addressed. One problem that arises is that one must specify what constitutes an extreme event.\nAlthough this is straightforward in the univariate case, there is no unambiguous way to do this in the multivariate case. The fundamental problem is that although it is possible to order a set of real-valued numbers, there is no natural way to order a set of vectors.\nAs an example, in the univariate case, given a set of observations formula_2 it is straightforward to find the most extreme event simply by taking the maximum (or minimum) of the observations. However, in the bivariate case, given a set of observations formula_3, it is not immediately clear how to find the most extreme event. Suppose that one has measured the values formula_4 at a specific time and the values formula_5 at a later time. Which of these events would be considered more extreme? There is no universal answer to this question.\nAnother issue in the multivariate case is that the limiting model is not as fully prescribed as in the univariate case. In the univariate case, the model (GEV distribution) contains three parameters whose values are not predicted by the theory and must be obtained by fitting the distribution to the data. In the multivariate case, the model not only contains unknown parameters, but also a function whose exact form is not prescribed by the theory. However, this function must obey certain constraints.\nIt is not straightforward to devise estimators that obey such constraints though some have been recently constructed.\nAs an example of an application, bivariate extreme value theory has been applied to ocean research.\nNon-stationary extremes.\nStatistical modeling for nonstationary time series was developed in the 1990s. Methods for nonstationary multivariate extremes have been introduced more recently.\nThe latter can be used for tracking how the dependence between extreme values changes over time, or over another covariate.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the seat of Gmina Prabuty.\nGeographical location.\nPrabuty is located between the Liwieniec and Sowica lakes, approximately 18 kilometers east of Kwidzyn, 100 kilometers southeast of Gda\u0144sk, 100 kilometers west of Olsztyn, and 133 kilometers southwest of Kaliningrad.\nPrabuty is a rail junction on the Warsaw\u2013Gdynia railway.\nHistory.\nIn 1236, the Teutonic Knights under Henry III, Margrave of Meissen, destroyed an Old Prussian fortress between the lakes Dzierzgo\u0144 and Liwieniec. The settlement was first mentioned in 1250 as \"Riesenburg\". Albert, the Bishop of Pomesania, founded the castle and town in 1270 and moved his seat there. It would remain the primary seat of the Bishop of Pomesania until the diocese dissolved in 1587. The village grew around the castle and received Culm law city rights on 30 October 1330 from bishop Rudolf of Pomerania (1322\u20131332). The town suffered a fire in August 1375. The Lithuanian dukes \u0160vitrigaila and Vaidutis visited the town in 1379 and 1381 respectively. In 1410 and 1414 it was captured by the Poles.\nKnights and squires of the Prabuty district were co-founders of the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation in 1440. Since its establishment, part of the population wanted the town to join the organization. In 1451, the town council eventually joined the Prussian Confederation, but bishop Kaspar Linke expelled the councilors and confiscated their property. The town was accepted again by the organization in February 1454, and upon the request of the organization, in March 1454, Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon incorporated the region and town to the Kingdom of Poland, and the Thirteen Years' War broke out. The Bishop and canons of Pomesania also pledged allegiance to the Polish King. Around that time, the town was mentioned in documents as \"Prabuth\". After the Battle of Chojnice, in which Polish forces were defeated, the town was forced to side with the Order again. After the war and the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), the town became a part of Poland as a fief, and Pomesanian bishops retained their rule over the area. In 1523, the diocese of Pomesania became Lutheran. In 1525 the town became part of Ducal Prussia, a vassal state of Poland. In 1556, a synod was held in the town. In 1587, with the secularization of the diocese of Pomesania, the town lost its status as the episcopal seat.\nThe town suffered during the 17th century Polish-Swedish wars. In 1628, half of it was burnt down, and in 1688 the remainder was burned. In 1722, fire caused destruction once again.\nIn 1701, as part of Ducal Prussia, the town became a part of the Kingdom of Prussia and part of the newly created province of West Prussia in 1773. Despite this, as of 1789, Polish Protestant church services were still held in the town, and there was a Polish municipal school there. In October 1831, several Polish cavalry and infantry units and honor guards of the November Uprising stopped in the town on the way to their internment places. In 1871, the town became part of the German Empire in the framework of the Prussian-led unification of Germany. Until 1919, Riesenburg belonged to the administrative district of Regierungsbezirk Marienwerder in the Province of West Prussia.\nAfter World War I, a referendum was held concerning the future nationality of the town, which remained part of Weimar Germany. From 1920 to 1939, Riesenburg belonged to the administrative district of Regierungsbezirk Westpreu\u00dfen in the Province of East Prussia and from 1939 until 1945 to the district of Regierungsbezirk Marienwerder in the province of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia.\nDuring World War II Germany operated a prisoner-of-war camp in the town. The town was captured by the Soviet Red Army in 1945 in the final months of the war. It then became again part of Poland. Most of the German inhabitants were expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and the pre-war Polish population was joined by Poles displaced from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union.\nHeinz Heydrich (1905\u201344), brother of Reinhard Heydrich, is buried in the local military cemetery, according to the Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt).\nSports.\nThe local football club is Pogo\u0144 Prabuty.

{"id": "50739", "revid": "196446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50739", "title": "Iaido", "text": "Japanese martial art\n, abbreviated , is a Japanese martial art that emphasizes being aware and capable of quickly drawing the sword and responding to sudden attacks.\nIaido consists of four main components: the smooth, controlled movements of drawing the sword from its scabbard (or saya), striking or cutting an opponent, shaking blood from the blade, and replacing the sword in the scabbard. While beginning practitioners of iaido may start learning with a wooden sword (bokut\u014d \u6728\u5200) depending on the teaching style of a particular instructor, most of the practitioners use a blunt-edged sword called an iait\u014d or \"mogit\u014d\". Few, more experienced, iaido practitioners use a sharp-edged sword (\"shinken\").\nPractitioners of iaido are called \"iaidoka\".\nOrigins of the name.\nThe term \"iaido\" appears in 1932 and consists of the kanji (i), (ai), and (d\u014d). The origin of the first two characters, , is believed to come from saying , which can be roughly translated as \"being constantly (prepared), match/meet (the opposition) immediately\". Thus the primary emphasis in 'iai' is on the psychological state of being present (\u5c45). The secondary emphasis is on drawing the sword and responding by harmonising with a sudden attack as quickly as possible (\u5408).\nThe last character, , is generally translated into English as the way or path. The term \"iaido\" approximately translates into English as \"the way of mental presence and immediate reaction\", and was popularized by Nakayama Hakudo.\nThe term emerged from iaijutsu (lit. \"the art of mental presence and immediate reaction\") and the general trend to replace the suffix (\"the art of\") with in Japanese martial arts in order to emphasize the philosophical or spiritual aspects of the practice.\nPurpose.\nIaido encompasses hundreds of styles of swordsmanship, all of which subscribe to non-combative aims and purposes. Iaido is an intrinsic form of Japanese modern budo.\nIaido reflects the moral principles of the classical warrior and aims to cultivate a spiritually balanced individual characterized by intellect, sensitivity, and resolute will.\nThe practice is primarily performed solo in the form of kata, which involve executing a variety of techniques against one or more imaginary opponents. Each kata begins and ends with the sword sheathed. Regardless of the specific technique used, imagination and concentration are essential to preserve the sense of a real combat situation and to keep the kata engaging. Iaidoka are often encouraged to practice kendo in order to maintain a combative spirit. It is common for high-ranking kendoka (practitioners of kendo) to also hold high rank in iaido, and vice versa.\nTo perform the kata appropriately, iaidoka likewise learn carriage, development, grip and swing. At times iaidoka will practice complementary katas from kendo or kenjutsu. Unlike kendo, iaido practice never involves sparring.\nMoral and religious influences.\nThe metaphysical aspects of iaido have been influenced by several philosophical and religious currents. Iaido blends the ethics of Confucianism, methods of Zen, philosophical Taoism, the purifying rites of Shinto and aspects of bushido.\nT\u014dh\u014d-gata techniques.\nA set of five koryu iaido forms\nSeitei-gata techniques.\nThe 12 official kata currently recognised by the All Japan Kendo Federation are (in Romanised form):\nBecause iaido is practiced with a weapon, it is almost entirely practiced using solitary forms, or kata performed against one or more imaginary opponents. Multiple-person kata exist in some schools of iaido; for safety, iaidoka usually use bokken for such kata practice. Iaido does include competition in the form of kata, but does not use sparring of any kind. Because of this non-fighting practice, and iaido's emphasis on precise, controlled, fluid motion, it is sometimes referred to as \"moving Zen.\" Most of the styles and schools do not practice \"tameshigiri\", cutting techniques.\nA part of iaido is \"nukitsuke\". This is a quick draw of the sword, accomplished by simultaneously drawing the sword from the \"saya\" and also moving the \"saya\" back in \"saya-biki\".\nHistory.\nIaido started in the mid-1500s. Hayashizaki Jinsuke Shigenobu (1542 - 1621) is generally acknowledged as the organizer of Iaido. There were many different Koryu (customary schools), however just a few remain practiced today. Just about every one of them additionally concentrate on more seasoned school created amid 16-seventeenth century, in the same way as Muso-Shinden-ryu, Hoki-ryu, Muso-Jikiden-Eishin-ryu, Shinto-Munen-ryu, Tamiya-ryu, Yagyu-Shinkage-ryu, Mugai-ryu, Sekiguchi-ryu, et cetera.\nAfter the collapse of the Japanese feudal system in 1868, the founders of the modern disciplines borrowed from the theory and the practice of classical disciplines as they had studied or practiced. The founding in 1895 of the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (DNBK) \u5927\u65e5\u672c\u6b66\u5fb3\u4f1a (lit. \"Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society\") in Kyoto, Japan. was also an important contribution to the development of modern Japanese swordsmanship. In 1932 DNBK officially approved and recognized the Japanese discipline, \"iaido\"; this year was the first time the term \"iaido\" appeared in Japan. After this initiative the modern forms of swordsmanship is organised in several iaido organisations. During the post-war occupation of Japan, the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai and its affiliates were disbanded by the Allies of World War II in the period 1945\u20131950. However, in 1950, the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai was reestablished and the practice of the Japanese martial disciplines began again.\nThe (ZNIR) was founded in 1948.\nIn 1952, the (IMAF) was founded in Tokyo, Japan. IMAF is a Japanese organization promoting international Bud\u014d, and has seven divisions representing the various Japanese martial arts, including iaido.\nAlso in 1952, the All Japan Kendo Federation (ZNKR) was founded.\nUpon formation of various organizations overseeing martial arts, a problem of commonality appeared. Since members of the organization were drawn from various backgrounds, and had experience practicing different schools of iaido, there arose a need for a common set of kata, that would be known by all members of organization, and that could be used for fair grading of practitioner's skill. Two of the largest Japanese organizations, All Japan Kendo Federation (ZNKR) and All Japan Iaido Federation (ZNIR), each created their own representative set of kata for this purpose.\nKata under the respective iaido organizations.\nT\u014dh\u014d Iaido.\nThe All Japan Iaido Federation (ZNIR, \"Zen Nihon Iaido Renmei\", founded 1948) has a set of five koryu iaido forms, called T\u014dh\u014d, contributed from the five major schools whose teachers were involved in the creation of the organization.\nSeitei Iaido.\nSeitei or Zen Nippon Kendo Renmei Iaido (\u5236\u5b9a) are technical forms based on \"seitei-gata\", or standard forms of sword-drawing techniques, created by the Zen Nihon Kendo Renmei (All Japan Kendo Federation). This standard set of iaido kata was created in 1969 by a committee formed by the All Japan Kendo Federation (AJKF, \"Zen Nippon Kendo Renmei\" or ZNKR).\nThe twelve Seitei iaido forms (\"seitei-gata\") are standardised for the tuition, promotion and propagation of iaido at the iaido clubs, that are members of the regional Kendo federations. All dojos, that are members of the regional Kendo federations teach this set. Since member federations of International Kendo Federation (FIK) uses seitei gata as a standard for their iaido exams and \"shiai\", \"seitei iaido\" has become the most widely practised form of iaido in Japan and the rest of the world.\nOther organizations.\nSingle-style federations usually do not have a standardized \"grading\" set of kata, and use kata from their koryu curriculum for grading and demonstrations.\nSchools.\nMany iaido organisations promote sword technique from the seiza (sitting position) and refer to their art as \"iaido\". One of the popular versions of these is the Mus\u014d Shinden-ry\u016b \u5922\u60f3\u795e\u4f1d\u6d41, an iaido system created by Nakayama Hakud\u014d (1872\u20131958) in 1932. The Mus\u014d Shinden-ry\u016b is an interpretation of one of the Jinsuke-Eishin lines, called Shimomura-ha.\nThe other line of Jinsuke-Eishin, called Tanimura-ha, was created by Got\u014d Magobei Masasuke (died 1898) and \u014ce Masaji Shikei (1852\u20131927). It was \u014ce Masaji Shikei who began formally referring to his iaido branch as the Mus\u014d Jikiden Eishin-ry\u016b \u7121\u53cc\u76f4\u4f1d\u82f1\u4fe1\u6d41 during the Taish\u014d era (1912\u20131926).\nAnother popular iai school mostly found worldwide is Mugai ryu. Mugai-ry\u016b (\u7121\u5916\u6d41) or \"Outer Nothingness School\" is a Japanese kory\u016b martial art school founded by Tsuji Gettan Sukemochi (\u8fbb\u6708\u4e39\u8cc7\u8302) on 23 June 1680. Its formal name is Mugai Shinden Kenp\u014d (\u7121\u5916\u771f\u4f1d\u5263\u6cd5).\nActually in the beginning, Mugai Ryu started as kenjutsu only school, but sent and recommended its disciples to learn another koryu named \"Jikyo-ryu iaijutsu\", and after Jikyo ryu vanished without any successor. It is renamed Mugai ryu iaijutsu/iaido up until today.\nAnother popular Iaido school is Toyama-ry\u016b (\u6238\u5c71\u6d41), which was established in 1925 in Japan. It was created by the Japanese army during World War II to create a simplified form. This style emphasizes the most important aspects of drawing and cutting. After the war it became obsolete, but was revived after 1952.\nRanks.\nRanking in iaido depends on the school and/or the member federations to which a particular school belongs. Iaido as it is practiced by the International Kendo Federation (FIK) and All Japan Iaido Federation (ZNIR) uses the kyu-dan system, created in 1883.\nModern kendo is almost entirely governed by the FIK, including the ranking system.\nIaido is commonly associated with either the FIK or the ZNIR, although there are many extant kory\u016b which may potentially use the menkyo system of grading, or a different system entirely. Iaido as governed by the FIK establishes 10th dan as the maximum attainable rank, though there are no living 10th practitioners in Kendo, there still remains many in Iaido. While there are some living 9th dan practitioners of kendo, the All Japan Kendo Federation only currently awards up to 8th dan. Most other member federations of the FIK have followed suit.\nInternational Iaido Sport Competition.\nIaido, in its modern form, is practiced as a competitive sport, separately regulated by the All Japan Kendo Federation and All Japan Iaido Federations.\nAn iaido competition consists of two or more iaidoka performing their kata next to each other and simultaneously. The competitors will be judged by a panel of judges according to the standardized regulations.\nThe European Kendo Federation has arranged European iaido championships since 1993, and this competition continues to be held every year with a few exceptions.\nOrganisations.\nMany national and regional organisations manage and promote iaido activities. The following is a list of international organisations which include iaido:\nDai Nippon Butoku Kai (DNBK), established in 1895 in Kyoto, approved and recognized the discipline iaido.\nThe International Martial Arts Federation (IMAF) was established in Kyoto in 1952 and is dedicated to the promotion and development of the martial arts worldwide, including iaido.\nInternational Kendo Federation (FIK), established in 1970, an international organization for Kendo, Iaido and Jodo practitioners, which many national Kendo federations are a member of.\nAll Japan Iaido Federation (or Zen Nippon Iaido Renmei) (ZNIR) was established in 1954 \"in accordance with the Japanese bushido spirit to pass on the time-honoured system of Kobudo Iaido\".\nThe World Mus\u014d Jikiden Eishin-ry\u016b Iaido Federation, established in Tokyo in 2011, is dedicated to ensuring the orthodox transmission of MJER Iaido to future generations worldwide, as well as promoting and preserving the development of other schools.\nZen Nihon Toyama Ryu Iaido Renmei (ZNTIR) established in Machida Japan after WW II was created as \"Toyama-Ryu Shinko kai\" established by Tokutomi Tasaburo and Nakamura Taizaburo who were Gunto Soho instructors at the Toyama Ryu Military Academy for the Japanese Imperial Army. Over time the \"Toyama-Ryu Shinko-Kai\" was renamed as Zen Nihon Toyama Ryu Iaido Renmei, and practice eight kata from a derivative of Gunto Soho.\nMurayama City, the birthplace of iaido, operates a number of iaido experience and training programs. This includes training with some of the iaido masters and English-speaking teachers in Yamagata.\nIreland.\nIaido is part of Kendo na h\u00c9ireann, the Irish Kendo Federation, which supports Kendo, Iaido, and Jodo. Founded in 1998, the federation is affiliated with the Irish Martial Arts Commission (IMAC), the European Kendo Federation, and the International Kendo Federation, with dojos in counties such as Cavan, Cork, Dublin, and Galway.

A \"daish\u014d\" is typically depicted as a \"katana\" and \"wakizashi\" (or a \"tant\u014d\") mounted in matching \"koshirae\", but originally the \"daish\u014d\" was the wearing of any long and short \"katana\" together. The \"katana/wakizashi\" pairing is not the only \"daish\u014d\" combination as generally any longer sword paired with a \"tant\u014d\" is considered to be a \"daish\u014d\". \"Daish\u014d\" eventually came to mean two swords having a . A \"daish\u014d\" could also have matching blades made by the same swordsmith, but this was in fact uncommon and not necessary for two swords to be considered to be a \"daish\u014d\", as it would have been more expensive for a samurai.\nHistory.\nThe concept of the \"daisho\" originated with the pairing of a short sword with whatever long sword was being worn during a particular time period. The \"tachi\" would be paired with a \"tant\u014d\", and later the \"katana\" would be paired with another shorter katana called a \"chiisagatana\". With the advent of the \"katana\", the \"wakizashi\" eventually was chosen by samurai as the short sword over the \"tant\u014d\". Kanzan Sat\u014d, in his book titled \"The Japanese Sword\", notes that there did not seem to be any particular need for the \"wakizashi\" and suggests that the \"wakizashi\" may have become more popular than the \"tant\u014d\" as the \"wakizashi\" was more suited for indoor fighting. He mentions the custom of leaving the \"katana\" at the door of a castle or palace when entering while continuing to wear the \"wakizashi\" inside.\n\"Daish\u014d\" may have become popular around the end of the Muromachi period (1336 to 1573) as several early examples date from the late 16th century. An edict in 1629 defining the duties of a samurai required that \"daish\u014d\" be worn when on official duty. Wearing \"daish\u014d\" was limited to the \"samurai\" class in 1683, and became a symbol of their rank Samurai could wear decorative swords in daily life, but the Tokugawa shogunate regulated the appearance of swords for formal attire such as when samurai came to a castle. The daisho for formal attire was limited to the scabbard and winding thread in solid black, and the hilt wrapped with white ray skin.\nAccording to most traditional \"kenjutsu\" schools, only one sword of the \"daisho\" would have been used in combat. However, in the first half of the 17th century, the famous swordsman Miyamoto Musashi promoted the use of a one-handed grip, which allowed both swords to be used simultaneously. This technique, called \"nit\u014dken\", is a main element of the \"Niten Ichi-ry\u016b\" style of swordsmanship that Musashi founded.\nDuring the Meiji period an edict was passed in 1871 abolishing the requirement that \"daish\u014d\" be worn by samurai, and in 1876 wearing swords in public by most of Japan's population was banned; thus ended the use of the \"daish\u014d\" as the symbol of the samurai. The samurai class was abolished soon after the sword ban.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The sequel to \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), it is the third installment in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy and the sixth chronological film in the \"Skywalker Saga\". The film follows the ongoing struggle between the malevolent Galactic Empire and the freedom fighters of the Rebel Alliance. As the rebels attempt to destroy the Empire's second Death Star, Luke Skywalker tries to bring his father, Darth Vader, back from the dark side of the Force. The film stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, and Frank Oz.\nSteven Spielberg, David Lynch, and David Cronenberg were considered to direct the film before Marquand signed on as director. The production team relied on Lucas's storyboards during pre-production. While writing the shooting script, Lucas, Kasdan, Marquand, and producer Howard Kazanjian spent two weeks in conference discussing ideas to construct it. Kazanjian's schedule pushed shooting to begin a few weeks early to allow Industrial Light &amp; Magic more time to work on the film's effects in post-production. Filming took place in England, California, and Arizona from January to .\nThe film was released in theaters on May 25, 1983. It grossed $374 million worldwide during its initial theatrical run, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1983. The film was well received by critics, with strong praise going to the performances of the actors, John Williams' score, the special effects and the action sequences. Several re-releases and revisions to the film have followed over the decades, which have brought its total gross to $482 million. The United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2021. A prequel trilogy, released between 1999 and 2005, and a sequel trilogy, released between 2015 and 2019, followed.\nPlot.\nOne year after Han Solo's capture and imprisonment in carbonite, C-3PO and R2-D2 enter the palace of the crime lord Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine. They were sent as a goodwill gift by Luke Skywalker, who hopes to negotiate with Jabba for Han's release. Disguised as a bounty hunter, Princess Leia infiltrates the palace under the pretense of having captured Chewbacca. She releases Han from the carbonite but is caught by Jabba and enslaved. Luke arrives to bargain for the release of his friends, but Jabba drops him through a trapdoor to be eaten by a rancor, only for one of Jabba's guards to get eaten alive. After Luke kills the beast, Jabba decrees that he, Han, and Chewbacca will be fed to a Sarlacc, a deadly ground-dwelling creature. Luke retrieves his new green lightsaber from R2-D2, and the group of friends battle Jabba's thugs aboard his sail barge. During the chaos, Boba Fett falls into the Sarlacc's pit, and Leia strangles Jabba to death with her chains. The group escapes as Jabba's sail barge is destroyed.\nAs the others rendezvous with the Rebel Alliance, Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training with Yoda, who is dying when he arrives. Before Yoda dies, he confirms that Darth Vader is Luke's father, the former Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, and that there is another Skywalker. Obi-Wan Kenobi's Force spirit tells Luke that Leia is his twin sister, and that he must face Vader again to finish his training and defeat the Empire.\nThe Alliance learns that the Empire has been constructing a second Death Star under the supervision of the Emperor. The station is protected by an energy shield on the forest moon of Endor. Han leads a strike team, including Luke, Leia, and Chewbacca, to destroy its generator. Once on the moon, the team gains the trust of a tribe of Ewoks after an initial conflict. Later, Luke tells Leia she is his sister, and Vader is their father. Luke surrenders to Imperial troops and is brought before Vader, but fails to convince him to reject the dark side of the Force.\nLuke is brought to the Emperor, who intends to turn him to the dark side. He also reveals that Luke's friends on Endor and the rebel fleet are heading into a trap. On the forest moon, Han's team is captured by Imperial forces, but the Ewoks counterattack, allowing the rebels to infiltrate the shield generator. Meanwhile, with Lando Calrissian piloting the \"Millennium Falcon\", he and Admiral Ackbar lead the rebel assault on the Death Star, finding its shield still active and the Imperial fleet waiting for them.\nThe Emperor reveals to Luke that the Death Star is fully operational and orders the firing of its massive laser, which destroys a rebel starship. He tempts Luke to give in to his anger and embrace the dark side of the Force. Luke attacks him, but Vader intervenes, and the two engage in a lightsaber duel. During the battle, Vader discovers Leia is his daughter and threatens to turn her to the Dark Side, causing Luke to snap and sever Vader's prosthetic hand in a fit of rage. The Emperor orders Luke to kill his father, but Luke, realizing how close he is to suffering his father's fate, refuses. In response, the Emperor tortures Luke with Force lightning. Unwilling to let his son die, Vader throws the Emperor down a shaft to his demise, but is fatally electrocuted in the process. Before dying, Vader asks Luke to remove his mask in a moment of reconciliation.\nAfter the rebel strike team destroys the shield generator, Lando leads fighter ships into the Death Star's core. While the rebel fleet destroys the Imperial command ship, Lando and X-wing pilot Wedge Antilles destroy the Death Star's main reactor and escape before the station explodes. Luke cremates Vader's body on Endor before reuniting with his friends. As the rebels celebrate their victory, Luke sees the Force spirits of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and a redeemed Anakin standing nearby.\nCast.\nThe cast also includes Michael Pennington as Moff Jerjerrod, Kenneth Colley as Admiral Piett, Michael Carter as Bib Fortuna (voiced by Erik Bauersfeld, who was uncredited), Denis Lawson as Wedge, Tim Rose as Admiral Ackbar (also voiced by Bauersfeld, again uncredited), Dermot Crowley as General Madine, Caroline Blakiston as Mon Mothma, Warwick Davis as Wicket W. Warrick, Tony Cox as Widdle 'Willy' Warrick, Jeremy Bulloch as Boba Fett, Femi Taylor as Oola, Annie Arbogast as Sy Snootles, Claire Davenport as Fat Dancer, Jack Purvis as Teebo, Mike Edmonds as Logray, Jane Busby as Chief Chirpa, Malcom Dixon and Mike Cottrell as Ewok Warriors, and Nicki Reade as Nicki. Additional Imperial officers are portrayed by Adam Bareham (Stardestroyer Controller #1), Jonathan Oliver (Stardestroyer Controller #2), Pip Miller (Stardestroyer Captain #1), and Tom Mannion (Stardestroyer Captain #2).\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nFollowing discussions between \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas and producer Howard Kazanjian, a sequel to \"The Empire Strikes Back\" was swiftly put into production. As with the previous film, Lucas personally financed \"Return of the Jedi\". Lucas also chose not to direct the film himself, and started searching for a director. Irvin Kershner, who previously directed \"The Empire Strikes Back\", declined to direct after spending two years working on the previous film, choosing to direct \"Never Say Never Again\". Although Lucas's first choice was Steven Spielberg, their separate feuds with the Director's Guild led to him being banned from directing the film. Lucas approached David Lynch, who had recently been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for \"The Elephant Man\" in 1980, to helm \"Return of the Jedi.\" Lynch declined, saying that he had \"next door to zero interest\", believing Lucas should direct it since \"Star Wars\" was his creation.\nLucas also offered David Cronenberg the chance to direct, but he declined the offer as he did not want to work on material written by others. Lamont Johnson, director of \"The Last American Hero\" (1973), was also considered. Lucas eventually chose Richard Marquand. Lucas operated the second camera on set a few times. Lucas has admitted to being on the set frequently because of Marquand's relative inexperience with special effects. Lucas praised Marquand as a \"very nice person who worked well with actors\". Marquand did note that Lucas kept a conspicuous presence on set, joking, \"It is rather like trying to direct \"King Lear\" \u2013 with Shakespeare in the next room!\"\nThe screenplay was written by Lawrence Kasdan and Lucas (with uncredited contributions by David Peoples and Marquand), based on Lucas's story. Kasdan claims he told Lucas that \"Return of the Jedi\" was \"a\u00a0weak title\". Kazanjian said the same, and the title was changed to \"Revenge of the Jedi\" one or two days later. The screenplay itself was not finished until rather late in pre-production, well after a production schedule and budget had been created by Kazanjian and Marquand had been hired, which was unusual for a film. Instead, the production team relied on Lucas's story and rough draft in order to commence work with the art department. When it came time to formally write a shooting script, Lucas, Kasdan, Marquand and Kazanjian spent two weeks in conference discussing ideas; Kasdan used tape transcripts of these meetings to then construct the script.\nThe question of whether Ford would return for the final film arose during pre-production. Unlike Hamill and Fisher, Ford had not contracted to do two sequels, and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" had made him an even bigger star. Kazanjian said that Han was frozen in carbonite in \"Empire\" because the filmmakers were unsure whether the character would return. He also claimed that Lucas did not expect Ford to return, and that Han was initially not in the script. However, Kazanjian\u2014who also produced \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\u2014\"convinced Ford to return.\nFord felt that Han should die through self-sacrifice in the third film. Kasdan agreed, and said it should occur near the beginning of the third act, to make the audience wonder whether the other protagonists will survive. Gary Kurtz, who produced \"Star Wars\" and \"Empire\" but was replaced by Kazanjian for \"Jedi\", said that Han died in an early version of the script. Kurtz has suggested that one reason Lucas may have rejected the idea of Han dying was that it would not be good for merchandising. Kurtz also has claimed that an early script ended with the rebel forces in tatters, Leia grappling with her new duties as queen, and Luke walking off alone \"like Clint Eastwood in the spaghetti Westerns\".\nYoda was originally not meant to appear in the film, but Marquand strongly felt that returning to Dagobah was essential to resolve the dilemma raised by the previous film. The inclusion led Lucas to insert a scene in which Yoda confirms that Darth Vader is Luke's father because, after a discussion with a children's psychologist, he did not want younger moviegoers to dismiss Vader's claim as a lie. Many ideas from the original script were left out or changed. For instance, the Ewoks were going to be Wookiees and the \"Millennium Falcon\" was going to land on Endor. Following the defeat of the Emperor, the film was originally intended to end with Obi-Wan and Yoda returning to life from their spectral existence in the Force, along with Anakin Skywalker, thanks to Yoda being able to prevent him from becoming one with the Force. They would then join the rest of the characters in their celebration on Endor.\nCasting.\nAlan Webb was originally cast as the Emperor, but dropped out due to illness. Lindsay Anderson was offered the role, but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts. Ben Kingsley and David Suchet were also considered. Alan Rickman auditioned for the role of Moff Jerjerrod, but Michael Pennington was cast instead. Marquand initially wanted a famous actor such as Laurence Olivier or John Gielgud to play the unmasked Vader, but Lucas was concerned that such an actor would be distracting for audiences. Kenny Baker was originally cast as Wicket the Ewok, but he fell ill with food poisoning on the day of the shoot. He was replaced by Warwick Davis, who had no film acting experience.\nFilming.\nFilming began on January 11, 1982, and lasted through May 20, 1982, a schedule six weeks shorter than \"Empire\". Kazanjian's schedule pushed shooting as early as possible in order to give Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) as much time as possible to work on effects, and left some crew members dubious of their ability to be fully prepared for the shoot. Working on a budget of $32.5 million, Lucas was determined to avoid going over budget as had happened with \"Empire\". Kazanjian estimated that using ILM (owned wholly by Lucasfilm) for special effects saved the production approximately $18 million. However, the fact that Lucasfilm was a non-union company made acquiring shooting locations more difficult and more expensive, even though \"Star Wars\" and \"Empire\" had been big hits. The project was given the working title \"Blue Harvest\" with a tagline of \"Horror Beyond Imagination.\" This disguised what the production crew was really filming from fans and the press, and also prevented price gouging by service providers.\nThe first stage of production started with 78 days at Elstree Studios in England, where the film occupied all nine stages. The shoot commenced with a scene later deleted from the finished film where the heroes get caught in a sandstorm as they leave Tatooine. (This was the only major sequence cut from the film during editing.) For the rancor, Lucas wanted to use a stunt performer in a suit in the style of the Toho \"Godzilla\" films. The production team made several attempts, but were unable to create an adequate result. Lucas eventually relented and decided to film the rancor as a high-speed puppet.\nIn April, the crew moved to Arizona's Yuma Desert for two weeks of Tatooine exteriors. Production then moved to the redwood forests of northern California. Forested private land near Smith River and at the Chetham Grove section of Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park were used for the forests of Endor. The crew spent two weeks shooting the Endor forest exteriors, and then concluded at ILM in San Rafael, California, for about ten days of bluescreen shots. One of two \"skeletal\" post-production units shooting background matte plates spent a day in Death Valley. The other was a special Steadicam unit shooting forest backgrounds from June 15 to June 17, 1982, for the speeder chase near the middle of the film. Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown personally filmed these shots at less than one frame per second. By walking at about and projecting the footage at 24 frame/s, the motion seen in the film appeared as if it were moving at around . Vader's funeral was filmed at Skywalker Ranch.\nMarquand and Anthony Daniels clashed somewhat, leading to the latter recording his ADR (dialogue overdubs) with Lucas instead. Carrie Fisher disliked working with Marquand, too; he often yelled at her, which caused her to burst into tears on one occasion, which ruined her makeup and required an hour-long redo.\nPost-production.\nLucasfilm encountered problems when it tested the film in a commercial theater. Lucas and his employees could not hear many of the sound effects they had mixed. To make matters worse, the background noise in the theater muffled the majority of the film's sound, which played through the theater's normal commercial sound system. Many theaters at the time had poor room acoustics with mono sound. Lucas would solve the problem by creating a new cinema audio company, THX, and ensuring that all theaters playing his movies would use the new system.\nMeanwhile, special effects work at ILM quickly stretched the company to its operational limits. While the R&amp;D work and experience gained from the previous two films in the trilogy allowed for increased efficiency, this was offset by the desire to have the closing film raise the bar set by each of these films. A compounding factor was the intention of several departments of ILM to either take on other film work or decrease staff during slow cycles. Instead, as soon as production began, the entire company found it necessary to remain running 20\u00a0hours a day on six-day weeks in order to meet their goals by April 1, 1983. Of about 900 special effects shots, all VistaVision optical effects remained in-house, since ILM was the only company capable of using the format, while about 400 4-perf opticals were subcontracted to outside effects houses. Progress on the opticals was severely delayed for a time when ILM rejected about of film when the film perforations failed image registration and steadiness tests.\nMusic.\nJohn Williams composed the film's musical score and performed it with the London Symphony Orchestra. Orchestration credits also include Thomas Newman. The initial release of the film's soundtrack was on the RSO Records label in the United States. Sony Classical Records acquired the rights to the original trilogy scores in 2004 after gaining the rights to release the prequel trilogy soundtracks (\"The Phantom Menace\" and \"Attack of the Clones\"). In the same year, Sony Classical re-pressed the 1997 RCA Victor release of \"Return of the Jedi\" along with the other two films in the trilogy. The set was released with the new artwork mirroring the first DVD release of the film. Despite the Sony digital re-mastering, which minimally improved the sound heard only on high-end stereos, this 2004 release is essentially the same as the 1997 RCA Victor release.\nRelease.\n\"Return of the Jedi\" was released on May 25, 1983. It was originally slated to open on May 27, but was subsequently changed to coincide with the date of the 1977 release of the original \"Star Wars\" film. With a massive worldwide marketing campaign, illustrator Tim Reamer created the image for the movie poster and other advertising. At the time of its release, the film was advertised on posters and merchandise as simply \"Star Wars: Return of the Jedi\", despite its on-screen \"Episode VI\" distinction. The film was re-released in 1985.\nTitle change.\nThe original teaser trailer for the film carried the name \"Revenge of the Jedi\". In December 1982, Lucas decided that \"Revenge\" was not appropriate as a 'true Jedi should never seek revenge' and returned to his original title. By that time thousands of \"Revenge\" teaser posters (with artwork by Drew Struzan) had been printed and distributed. Lucasfilm stopped the shipping of the posters and sold the remaining stock of 6,800 posters to \"Star Wars\" fan club members for $9.50. In 2005, \"\", released as part of the prequel trilogy, alluded to the dismissed title \"Revenge of the Jedi\".\nBox office.\n\"Return of the Jedi\" grossed $314.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $166 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $480 million, against a production budget of about $32.5 million.\n\"Return of the Jedi\" collected a total of $6.2 million on its opening day, beating out ' to have the highest single day gross. It would hold the record for having the highest pre-Memorial Day Wednesday gross until 1996 when ' surpassed it. The film made $23 million from 1,002 theaters in its opening weekend and grossed a record $45.3 million in its opening week. It set a new domestic opening weekend record, surpassing the $14 million opening of \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\". Its $22,973 per theatre average would stand as a record for a nationwide release on an inflation-adjusted basis for 36 years until it was surpassed by \"\" in 2019. It finished first at the box office for six of its first seven weeks of release, only coming in second once behind \"Superman III\" in its fourth weekend. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 80 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run. When it was re-released in 1985, it made $11.2 million, which totaled its initial theatrical gross to $385.8 million worldwide. During its re-release in 1997, the film grossed $16.29 million in its opening weekend. When it was re-released in 2023, for its 40th anniversary, the film grossed $5.1 million to place #4 in the weekend box office.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nFilm critic Roger Ebert gave \"Return of the Jedi\" four out of four stars, calling it \"a complete entertainment, a feast for the eyes and a delight for the fancy. It's a little amazing how Lucas and his associates keep topping themselves.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" also gave the film four stars out of four and wrote, \"From the moment that the familiar \"Star Wars\" introductory words begin to crawl up the screen, \"Return of the Jedi\" is a childlike delight. It's the best video game around. And for the professional moviegoers, it is particularly enjoyable to watch every facet of filmmaking at its best.\"\nJames Harwood of \"Variety\" called the film \"a visual treat throughout,\" but thought that \"Hamill is not enough of a dramatic actor to carry the plot load here\" and Harrison Ford \"is present more in body than in spirit this time, given little to do but react to special effects. And it can't be said that either Carrie Fisher or Billy Dee Williams rise to previous efforts. But Lucas and director Richard Marquand have overwhelmed these performer flaws with a truly amazing array of creatures, old and new, plus the familiar space hardware.\" Sheila Benson of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that the film \"is fully satisfying, it gives honest value to all the hopes of its believers. With this last of the central \"Star Wars\" cycle, there is the sense of the closing of a circle, of leaving behind real friends. It is accomplished with a weight and a new maturity that seem entirely fitting, yet the movie has lost none of its sense of fun; it bursts with new inventiveness.\"\nGary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" said, \"\"Return of the Jedi,\" a feat of mass enchantment, puts the happy finishing touches on George Lucas' \"Star Wars\" saga. It was worth the wait, and the work is now an imposing landmark in contemporary popular culture\u2014a three-part, 6\u00bc-hour science-fiction epic of unabashed heroic proclivities.\" The film was also featured on the May 23, 1983, \"Time\" magazine cover issue (where it was labeled \"Star Wars III\"), where the reviewer Gerald Clarke said that while it was not as exciting as the first \"Star Wars\" film, it was \"better and more satisfying\" than \"The Empire Strikes Back\".\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called \"Return of the Jedi\" \"by far the dimmest adventure of the lot\" and stated, \"The joys of watching space battles as envisioned by wizards in studios and laboratories are not inexhaustible.\" Pauline Kael of \"The New Yorker\" stated, \"Some of the trick effects might seem miraculous if the imagery had any lustre, but \"Return of the Jedi\" is an impersonal and rather junky piece of moviemaking.\"\nChristopher John reviewed \"The Return of the Jedi\" in \"Ares\" magazine #15 and commented that \"\"Star Wars\" may not be dead, but \"Return of the Jedi\" is a failure, and is a cheap and tarnished crown for the series which shook the world of film when it started out ... a long time ago, in that galaxy far, far away.\"\nColin Greenland reviewed \"Return of the Jedi\" for \"Imagine\" magazine, and stated that \"You would think a series like \"Star Wars\", fuelled by public adoration, coasting along on the hyperdrive of its own hyperboles, would get inexorably worse. It is not. It is getting better.\"\nAccolades.\nIn 2021, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPost-release.\nRe-releases.\nIn 1997, for the 20th anniversary of the release of \"Star Wars\" (re-titled \"Episode IV: A New Hope\"), Lucas released the \"Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition\". Along with the two other films in the original trilogy, \"Return of the Jedi\" was rereleased on March 14, 1997 (moved up one week from its original announced release date of March 7 due to the box office success of \"The Empire Strikes Back\" the month prior), with a number of changes and additions, including the insertion of several alien band members and a different song in Jabba's throne room, the modification of the sarlacc to include a beak, the replacement of music at the closing scene, and a montage of different alien worlds celebrating the fall of the Empire. The runtime of the 1997 Special Edition of the film and all subsequent releases is approximately five minutes longer than the original theatrical version.\nThe film was re-released theatrically by 20th Century Studios on April 28, 2023, to commemorate the film's 40th anniversary.\nHome media.\nThe original theatrical version of \"Return of the Jedi\" was released on VHS and Laserdisc several times between 1986 and 1995, followed by releases of the Special Edition in the same formats between 1997 and 2000. Some of these releases contained featurettes; some were individual releases of just this film, while others were boxed sets of all three original films.\nOn September 21, 2004, the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy was released in a boxset on DVD with digital restoration and additional alterations made by Lucas.\nIn this version of \"Return of the Jedi\", Sebastian Shaw's portrayal of Anakin's spirit is replaced by Hayden Christensen, who portrayed Anakin in \"Attack of the Clones\" and \"Revenge of the Sith\". All three films of the trilogy were released individually on Limited Edition DVDs on September 12, 2006, with the original unaltered versions included as bonus features. These were collected in a box set on November 4, 2008.\nA Blu-ray Disc version of the six-film \"Star Wars\" saga was released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in September 2011, which incorporated more small changes to \"Return of the Jedi\", including making the Ewoks blink and having Vader yell \"No!\" as he throws the Emperor down the Death Star shaft; the latter change drew sharp negative criticism. Several deleted scenes from the film were included as special features, including a completed scene in which Vader communicates with Luke via the Force as Luke assembles his new lightsaber before infiltrating Jabba's palace, a sandstorm sequence following the sarlacc pit rescue, and a scene featuring Moff Jerjerrod and Death Star officers during the Battle of Endor.\nOn April 7, 2015, Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox, and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released \"Star Wars\" films. \"Return of the Jedi\" was released through the iTunes Store, Amazon Video, Vudu, Google Play, and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 10, 2015.\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment reissued \"Return of the Jedi\" on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download on September 22, 2019. Additionally, all six films were available for 4K HDR and Dolby Atmos streaming on Disney+ upon the service's launch on November 12, 2019. This version of the film was released by Disney on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray box set on March 31, 2020.\nLegacy.\nAccording to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 84% of critics have given the film a positive review with an average rating of 7.30/10, based on reviews from critics. The site's critics consensus reads: \"Though failing to reach the cinematic heights of its predecessors, \"Return of the Jedi\" remains an entertaining sci-fi adventure and a fitting end to the classic trilogy.\" At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 based on 24 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare average grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale.\nIn his review of the 1997 Special Edition re-release, the film critic James Kendrick called \"Return of the Jedi\" the weakest of the three original films, saying it depended \"too much on the slick commercialism\" of the franchise but that it was still \"a magnificent experience in its own right\". James Berardinelli described it as the least enjoyable and least innovative film of the trilogy. He opined that the Special Edition was not saved by the alterations, but that it was nevertheless a \"must-see\" for fans as the conclusion of the trilogy.\nFans are divided on the likelihood of Ewoks (being a primitive race of small creatures) defeating an armed ground force comprising the Empire's \"best troops\". Lucas has defended the scenario, saying that the Ewoks' purpose was to distract the Imperial troops and they did not really win. His inspiration for the Ewoks' victory came from the Vietnam War, where the Viet Cong prevailed against the technologically superior United States.\nMarketing.\nNovelization.\nThe novelization of \"Return of the Jedi\" was written by James Kahn and was released on May 12, 1983, thirteen days before the film's release.\nRadio drama.\nA three-hour radio drama adaptation of the film was written by Brian Daley with additional material contributed by John Whitman and was produced for and broadcast on National Public Radio in 1996 (over a decade after the radio adaptations of the first two \"Star Wars\" films). It was based on characters and situations created by George Lucas and on the screenplay by Kasdan and Lucas. Anthony Daniels reprised his role from the film as C-3PO, but Mark Hamill and Billy Dee Williams (who lent their voices to the previous radio adaptations) were replaced by newcomer Joshua Fardon and character actor Arye Gross, respectively. Bernard Behrens and Brock Peters reprised their roles as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader, respectively. John Lithgow voiced Yoda, and veteran character actor Ed Begley, Jr. played Boba Fett. Ed Asner voiced Jabba the Hutt, speaking only in grunts.\nComic book adaptation.\nMarvel Comics published a comic book adaptation of the film by writer Archie Goodwin and artists Al Williamson, Carlos Garzon, Tom Palmer, and Ron Frenz. The adaptation appeared in \"Marvel Super Special\" #27 and as a four-issue limited series. It was later reprinted in a mass market paperback, as well as collections of Marvel's self-titled \"Star Wars\" series. Marvel Super Special #27 was mistakenly released in April 1983, a month before the film itself, giving away spoilers to the film's plot. Hamill is a comic book fan and while he was in a comic book store, he discovered that the comic book was on sale there and alerted Lucasfilm. According to Carol Kalish who was Marvel's direct sales manager at the time, Marvel quickly recalled the book upon learning this mistake though it did not stop the premature revelation of the secrets of the film's plot. Kalish kept her job, as did everyone else in the Sales Department, as the incident was apparently considered a simple mistake.\nBook-and-record set.\nLucasfilm adapted the story for a children's book-and-record set. Released in 1983, the 24-page \"Star Wars: Return of the Jedi\" read-along book was accompanied by a 33\u2153 rpm gramophone record. Each page of the book contained a cropped frame from the film with an abridged and condensed version of the story. The record was produced by Buena Vista Records.\nPrequels and sequels.\n16 years after the release of \"Return of the Jedi\", Lucas wrote and directed the prequel trilogy, consisting of the films ', ', and \"\". The films chronicle the history between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, and the latter's fall to the darkside and transformation into Darth Vader. The prequel trilogy was financially successful, and polarized critics and fans on their release for the storylines and some new characters.\nAfter Lucas sold the\u00a0\"Star Wars\"\u00a0franchise to the Walt Disney Company in 2012, Disney developed a sequel trilogy, consisting of \"The Force Awakens\", \"The Last Jedi\", and \"The Rise of Skywalker\". Original trilogy cast members including Ford, Hamill, and Fisher reprised their roles, alongside new characters portrayed by Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, and Oscar Isaac. Standalone films and television series have also been released, exploring adventures set around the main trilogy arcs. Most relevantly, the Disney+ streaming shows \"The Book of Boba Fett\", \"\", \"The Mandalorian\" and the latter's upcoming spin-offs are set a few years after \"Return of the Jedi\", bridging the time period between that film and \"The Force Awakens\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50745", "revid": "46696839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50745", "title": "Paul Simon", "text": "American singer-songwriter (born 1941)\nPaul Frederic Simon (born October 13, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist, known for his solo work and his collaborations with Art Garfunkel. He and Garfunkel, whom he met in elementary school in 1953, came to prominence in the 1960s as Simon &amp; Garfunkel. Their blend of folk and rock, including hits such as \"The Sound of Silence\" (1965), \"Mrs. Robinson\" (1968), \"America\" (1968), and \"The Boxer\" (1969), served as a soundtrack to the 1960s counterculture. Their final album, \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" (1970), is among the best-selling of all time.\nAs a solo artist, Simon has explored genres including gospel, reggae, and soul. His albums \"Paul Simon\" (1972), \"There Goes Rhymin' Simon\" (1973), and \"Still Crazy After All These Years\" (1975) kept him in the public eye and drew acclaim, producing the hits \"Mother and Child Reunion\" (1972), \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\" (1972), and \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\" (1975). Simon reunited with Garfunkel for several tours and the 1981 Concert in Central Park. Simon hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" four times from 1975 to 1987 and has served as the musical guest various times on the show. He made his acting debut in Woody Allen's romantic comedy \"Annie Hall\" (1977).\nIn 1986, Simon released his most successful and acclaimed album, \"Graceland\", incorporating South African influences. \"You Can Call Me Al\" became one of Simon's most successful singles. \"Graceland\" was followed by \"The Rhythm of the Saints\" (1990) and a second Concert in the Park in 1991, without Garfunkel, which approximately 500,000 people attended. In 1998, Simon wrote a Broadway musical, \"The Capeman\", that was poorly received. He continued to record and tour in the 21st century. His later albums, such as \"You're the One\" (2000), \"So Beautiful or So What\" (2011), and \"Stranger to Stranger\" (2016), introduced him to new generations. His most recent album, \"Seven Psalms\", was released in 2023.\nSimon has twice been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and has won 16 Grammy Awards, including three for Album of the Year. Two of his works, \"Sounds of Silence\" (1966) (as part of Simon &amp; Garfunkel) and \"Graceland\", were inducted into the National Recording Registry for their cultural significance. He was honored with the Kennedy Center Honors in 2001 and the Library of Congress's Gershwin Prize in 2007. He is a co-founder of the Children's Health Fund, a nonprofit organization that provides medical care to children. Simon is a supporter of the effective altruism movement, which uses evidence to determine where charitable giving will do the most good.\nEarly life and education.\nSimon was born on October 13, 1941, in Newark, New Jersey, to Hungarian-Jewish parents. His father, Louis (1916\u20131995), a professor of education at the City College of New York, was a double bass player and dance bandleader who performed under the name Lee Sims. His mother, Belle (1910\u20132007), was an elementary-school teacher. In 1945, his family moved to the Kew Gardens Hills section of Flushing, Queens, in New York City.\nThe musician Donald Fagen described Simon's childhood as that of \"a certain kind of New York Jew, almost a stereotype really, to whom music and baseball are very important. I think it has to do with the parents. The parents are either immigrants or first-generation Americans who felt like outsiders, and assimilation was the key thought\u2014they gravitated to black music and baseball, looking for an alternative culture.\" Simon said Fagen's description was not far from the truth. He described his father as funny and smart, but said he worked late and did not see his children much. He recalls hearing \"Gee\" by The Crows on \"Make Believe Ballroom\": \"It was really the first thing I heard on there that I liked. And it was really the first time I heard rock and roll.\" He tried to explain to his father the feeling he got hearing \"Earth Angel\": \"My father was a very good musician. And he comes from an era of very sophisticated music. Big bands, and Sinatra ... He didn't buy it. But I love that record\".\nSimon met Art Garfunkel when they were 11 years old and performed together in a production of \"Alice in Wonderland\" for their sixth-grade graduation. The two began singing together at age 13, occasionally performing at school dances. At age 12 or 13, Simon wrote his first song, \"The Girl for Me\", for him and Garfunkel to perform. According to Simon, it became the \"neighborhood hit\". His father wrote the words and chords on paper for the boys to use, and that paper became the first officially copyrighted Simon and Garfunkel song. It is now in the Library of Congress. In 1957, in their mid-teens, they recorded the song \"Hey, Schoolgirl\" under the name \"Tom &amp; Jerry\", a name given to them by their label, Big Records. The single reached number 49 on the Billboard charts.\nAfter graduating from Forest Hills High School, Simon majored in English at Queens College and graduated in 1963. Garfunkel studied mathematics education at Columbia University in Manhattan. Simon was a brother in the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, and attended Brooklyn Law School for one semester in 1963.\nCareer.\nBetween 1957 and 1964, Simon wrote, recorded, and released more than 30 songs. He and Garfunkel occasionally reunited as Tom &amp; Jerry to record singles, including \"Our Song\" and \"That's My Story\". Most of the songs Simon recorded during that time he performed alone, or with musicians other than Garfunkel. They were released on minor record labels including Amy, Big, Hunt, King, Tribute and Madison. Simon used several pseudonyms for these recordings, including \"Jerry Landis\", \"Paul Kane\", and \"True Taylor\". By 1962, working as Jerry Landis, he was a frequent writer/producer for several Amy Records artists, overseeing material released by Dotty Daniels, the Vels and Ritchie Cordell.\nSimon enjoyed moderate success with singles as part of the group Tico and the Triumphs, including \"Motorcycle\", which reached number 99 on the \"Billboard\" charts in 1962. Tico and the Triumphs released four 45s. Marty Cooper, known as Tico, sang lead on several of these releases, but \"Motorcycle\" featured Simon's vocal. Also in 1962, Simon reached number 97 on the pop charts as Jerry Landis, with the novelty song \"The Lone Teen Ranger\".\n1960s: Simon &amp; Garfunkel.\nIn early 1964, Simon and Garfunkel auditioned for Columbia Records, whose executive Clive Davis signed them to produce an album. Columbia decided to call them Simon &amp; Garfunkel instead of Tom &amp; Jerry, and according to Simon, this was the first time artists' surnames had been used in pop music without their first names. Simon and Garfunkel's first LP, \"Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.\", was released on October 19, 1964. It consisted of 12 songs, five of which were written by Simon. The album initially flopped.\nIn 1965, after the album's release, Simon moved to London and performed in folk clubs. He enjoyed his time in England and said in 1970, \"I had a lot of friends there and a girlfriend. I could play music there. There was no place to play in New York City. They wouldn't have me.\" He was welcomed by England's bohemian folk scene. He recalled, \"I learnt how to finger-pick acoustic guitar from Martin Carthy, who was connected to the Watersons from Hull, which of course led to 'Scarborough Fair', and I had never heard anything like those old English songs. The closest I got was the Everly Brothers, who borrowed from Appalachian melodies, so that period was very powerful for me. I had never heard anything like those old English songs. I was 21, 22, and emotionally open to everything.\" He wrote \"Homeward Bound\" and \"I Am a Rock\", and learned Davey Graham's guitar instrumental \"Anji\". He says that \u201cNothing in my repertoire can\u2019t be traced back to something I\u2019ve heard at some point, and the two big influences were street corner doo-wop from New York and the folk music I heard in England.\"\nIn England, Simon recorded a solo album, \"The Paul Simon Songbook\", featuring just his voice and guitar accompaniment; it was released only in the UK at the time, but later released elsewhere. He produced Jackson C. Frank's only album and co-wrote several songs with Bruce Woodley of the Australian pop group the Seekers, including \"I Wish You Could Be Here\", \"Cloudy\" and \"Red Rubber Ball\". Simon penned \"Someday, One Day\" for the Seekers, which charted around the same time as \"Homeward Bound\".\nRadio stations on the American East Coast began receiving requests for the \"Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.\" track \"The Sound of Silence\". Simon &amp; Garfunkel's producer, Tom Wilson, overdubbed the track with electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums, and it was released as a single, eventually reaching number 1 on the U.S. pop charts. Wilson did not inform the duo of his plan, and Simon was \"horrified\" when he first heard it. The single's success drew Simon back to the U.S. to reunite with Garfunkel, and they recorded the albums \"Sounds of Silence\" (1966), \"Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme\" (1966) and \"Bookends\" (1968).\nSimon &amp; Garfunkel also contributed to the soundtrack of Mike Nichols's film \"The Graduate\" (1967). While writing \"Mrs. Robinson\", Simon toyed with the title \"Mrs. Roosevelt\". When Garfunkel reported this indecision over the song's name to the director, Nichols replied, \"Don't be ridiculous! We're making a movie here! It's Mrs. Robinson!\"\nSimon and Garfunkel's relationship became strained and they split in 1970. At the urging of his wife, Peggy Harper, Simon called Davis to confirm the duo's breakup. For the next several years, they spoke only two or three times a year. Their last album, \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" (1970), was the bestselling album to date. The title track reached number one, and \"Cecilia\" and \"The Boxer\" made the top ten.\n1970\u20131976: Solo and \"Still Crazy After All These Years\".\nIn 1970, Simon taught songwriting at New York University. He said he had wanted to teach for a while, and hoped to help people avoid some of the mistakes he had made: \"You can teach somebody about writing songs. You can't teach someone how to write a song ... I'd go to a course if the Beatles would talk about how they made records because I'm sure I could learn something.\" He contributed the lyrics of \"Half of the People\" to Leonard Bernstein\u2019s \"Mass\" (1971).\nSimon pursued solo work while occasionally reuniting with Garfunkel for various projects. In April 1972, he performed at the Cleveland Arena alongside Joni Mitchell and James Taylor in a benefit concert for George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign. He and Garfunkel reunited in mid-June that year at Madison Square Garden in another concert for McGovern.\nSimon's next album, \"Paul Simon\", was released in January 1972. It featured an early experiment with world music, the reggae-inspired \"Mother and Child Reunion\", recorded with Jimmy Cliff's band. It reached both the American and British Top 5. The album received universal acclaim and critics praised its variety of styles and confessional lyrics. \"Paul Simon\" reached number 4 in the U.S. and number 1 in the UK and Japan, and produced another Top 30 hit, \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\". Simon also provided guitar on Garfunkel's 1973 album \"Angel Clare\", and added backing vocals to the song \"Down in the Willow Garden\".\nSimon's next project, the pop-folk album \"There Goes Rhymin' Simon\", was released in May 1973. The lead single, \"Kodachrome\", was a number 2 hit in the U.S. The follow-up, the gospel-flavored \"Loves Me Like a Rock\", topped the \"Cashbox\" charts. Other songs like \"American Tune\" and \"Something So Right\" (a tribute to Simon's first wife, Peggy) became part of his repertoire. The album reached number 1 on the \"Cashbox\" album charts. In March 1974 he released a live album, \"Live Rhymin\"', containing elements of Latin and religious music.\nHis next album, produced by Simon and Phil Ramone, was \"Still Crazy After All These Years\", released in October 1975. The mood of the album, written after Simon's divorce, was darker. It contains \"Gone at Last\", a duet with Phoebe Snow, and the Simon &amp; Garfunkel reunion track \"My Little Town\" (a number 9 on \"Billboard\"). Simon wrote the song for Garfunkel, whose solo output Simon felt lacked \"bite\", and it was included on Garfunkel's album \"Breakaway\". Contrary to popular belief, the song was not based on Simon's early life in New York City. The album is his only number 1 on the \"Billboard\" charts to date. The 18th Grammy Awards named it the Album of the Year, and his performance on it the year's Best Male Pop Vocal. The third single from the album, \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\", reached the top spot on the \"Billboard\" charts. On May 3, 1976, Simon put together a benefit show at Madison Square Garden for the New York Public Library that raised over $30,000.\n1977\u20131985: \"One-Trick Pony\" and \"Hearts and Bones\".\nAfter releasing three successful studio albums, Simon worked on various projects. He wrote music for Hal Ashby's \"Shampoo\" (1975). \"Slip Slidin' Away\", the lead single of his 1977 compilation \"Greatest Hits, Etc.\", reached number 5 in the U.S. Simon has also had several acting roles in films and television shows. He played music producer Tony Lacey, a supporting character in Woody Allen's film \"Annie Hall\" (1977) and made a cameo appearance in the movie \"\" the following year. In 1981 he appeared in an episode of \"The Muppet Show\", the only episode of the series to use the songs of one songwriter. He appeared in several episodes of \"Sesame Street\" in the 1970s and 1980s, including in a memorable performance of \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\" in 1977, and a cameo appearance in the song \"Put Down the Duckie!\" in 1986.\nIn 1980, Simon released \"One-Trick Pony\", his first album with Warner Bros. Records and his first in almost five years. The album was paired with the motion picture of the same name, which Simon wrote and starred in. The single \"Late in the Evening\" reached number 6 on \"Billboard\", but the album did not sell well. In 1981, Simon &amp; Garfunkel included eight songs from Simon's solo career in the set list of their September 19 concert in Central Park. Five were rearranged as duets and Simon performed the other three solo. The resulting live album, TV special, and videocassette (later DVD) releases were all major hits. \nAfter the success of \"The Concert in Central Park\", Simon &amp; Garfunkel returned to the studio, planning to record an album of new material. This would have been their first new recordings as a duo since their \"My Little Town\" and their first album of new material since \"Bridge over Troubled Water\". Simon ultimately decided to wipe Garfunkel's vocals from the mix, and in 1983, he released \"Hearts and Bones\" as a solo album. It is a polished, confessional album that was eventually viewed as one of his best works, but it achieved the lowest sales of his career. \"Hearts and Bones\" included \"The Late Great Johnny Ace\", a song about the deaths of American R&amp;B singer Johnny Ace and John Lennon. It featured an orchestral coda by Philip Glass. In January 1985, Simon performed for USA for Africa and on the relief fundraising single \"We Are the World\".\n1986\u20131992: \"Graceland\" and \"The Rhythm of the Saints\".\nIn 1986, Simon was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Music degree from Berklee College of Music, where he had served on the board of trustees.\nSimon decided to record an album of South African music after hearing a bootlegged tape of \"mbaqanga\", South African street music, and in 1986 he traveled to Johannesburg and recorded with African musicians. Additional sessions were held in New York. The sessions featured many South African acts, notably Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and Simon also collaborated with several American artists, duetting with Linda Ronstadt on \"Under African Skies\" and playing with Los Lobos on \"All Around the World or The Myth of Fingerprints\".\nThe resulting album, \"Graceland\", became Simon's most successful studio album. Simon recalls that \"I improvised in two ways - by making up melodies in falsetto, and by singing any words that came to mind down in my lower and mid range. I tried not to censor the words and to keep an ear cocked to see if a phrase came out that was interesting enough to suggest that my subconscious had allowed something significant to bubble out. Though I had no intentions of writing about Elvis Presley, the word 'Graceland' came very early. While writing the lyrics, I always tried to stay true to the mood of the music, which was flowing, pleasant and easy.\" Stephen Holden wrote \"Listening to \"Graceland,\" one gets the sense of an artist submitting to, and being swept up by, musical forces he does not totally understand. Adding a crucial extra dimension to the album is Mr. Simon's very urbane literary sensibility, which pulls against the simplicity of the music and lends the songs a kind of double vision. The music extends and enriches the language while the lyrics meditate on the music.\" It is estimated to have sold more than 16 million copies worldwide. \"Graceland\" won the 1987 Grammy for Album of the Year. In 2006, the album was added to the United States' National Recording Registry as \"culturally, historically or aesthetically important\".\nSimon was accused of breaking the cultural boycott imposed by the rest of the world against South Africa's apartheid regime by organizations such as Artists United Against Apartheid, anti-apartheid musicians (including Billy Bragg, Paul Weller and Jerry Dammers), and James Victor Gbeho (Ghana's Ambassador to the United Nations). Simon denied that he had gone to South Africa to \"take money out of the country\" and said he paid the black artists and split royalties with them and was not paid to play to a white-only audience. The United Nations Anti-Apartheid Committee supported \"Graceland\", as it showcased black South African musicians and offered no support to the South African government, but the African National Congress protested that it was a violation of the boycott. The Congress voted to ban Simon from South Africa and he was added to the United Nations blacklist, from which he was removed in January 1987. In 1989, Simon appeared on Dion's song \"Written on the Subway Wall\"/\"Little Star\" from \"Yo Frankie\", which peaked at number 97 in October 1990. In 1992, Simon and his band were invited to play in South Africa by Nelson Mandela.\nAfter \"Graceland\", Simon extended his roots with the Brazilian-flavored \"The Rhythm of the Saints\". Sessions for the album began in December 1989 in Rio de Janeiro and New York and featured guitarist J.J. Cale and Brazilian and African musicians. The album's tone is more introspective and low-key than that of \"Graceland\". Released in October 1990, the album received excellent reviews and sold well, peaking at number 4 in the U.S. and number 1 in the UK. The lead single, \"The Obvious Child\", featuring the Grupo Cultural Olodum, became Simon's last Top 20 hit in the UK and appeared near the bottom of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Although not as successful as \"Graceland\", \"The Rhythm of the Saints\" received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. Simon's ex-wife Carrie Fisher wrote in her autobiography \"Wishful Drinking\" that the song \"She Moves On\" is about her: \"If you can get Paul Simon to write a song about you, do it. Because he is so brilliant at it.\"\nThe success of both albums allowed Simon to stage another concert in New York. On August 15, 1991, he gave a second concert in Central Park, with African and South American bands. The concert's success surpassed all expectations, and 48,500 people are estimated to have attended. He later remembered the concert as \"the most memorable moment in my career\". Its success led to a live album and an Emmy-winning TV special. Simon embarked on the \"Born at the Right Time\" tour and promoted the album with further singles, including \"Proof\", which was accompanied by a humorous video featuring Chevy Chase and Steve Martin. On March 4, 1992, Simon performed on an episode of \"MTV Unplugged.\" Simon &amp; Garfunkel were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.\n1993\u20131998: \"Paul Simon 1964/1993\" and \"The Capeman\".\nAnother Simon &amp; Garfunkel reunion took place in September 1993, and Columbia released \"Paul Simon 1964/1993\". Originally a three-disc compilation, it became a reduced version on the two-disc album \"The Paul Simon Anthology\" one month later. In 1995, Simon appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" and performed the song \"Ten Years\", which he had composed for the show's tenth anniversary. Also in 1995 he featured in the Annie Lennox version of his 1973 song \"Something So Right\", which appeared briefly on the UK Top 50 after it was released as a single.\nSimon collaborated with poet Derek Walcott on a musical, \"The Capeman\", that opened on January 29, 1998. He worked enthusiastically on the project for many years, and described it as \"a New York Puerto Rican story based on events that happened in 1959\u2014events that I remembered.\" The musical told the story of a real-life Puerto Rican youth, Salvador Agron, who wore a cape while committing two murders in New York in 1959. He became a writer while in prison. Featuring Marc Anthony as the young Agron and Rub\u00e9n Blades as the older Agron, the play was not a success, receiving mixed reviews and poor box-office receipts. Clive Barnes wrote \"Here is the most bewitching and bewitched Broadway score in years -- music that, in a quite different way, only Stephen Sondheim has equaled,\" but that \"it was \"West Side Story\" particularized, de-prettified and de-balleticized. A tough call for entertainment.\"\nSimon recorded an album of songs from the show which was released in November 1997. The album received mixed reviews. Some critics praised its combination of doo-wop, rockabilly, and Caribbean music, but \"Songs from The Capeman\" was a failure, and for the first time in Simon's career he did not reach the Top 40 of the \"Billboard\" charts. The cast album was never released on CD but eventually became available online.\n1999\u20132007: \"You're the One\" and \"Surprise\".\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, Simon played the character of Simple Simon in the Disney Channel TV movie \"Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme\", and provided cameos in \"Millennium\" and \"The Great Buck Howard\". In the late 1990s, Simon wrote and produced a Broadway musical called \"The Capeman\", which lost $11 million during its 1998 run. After \"The Capeman\", Simon's career was in an unexpected crisis, but he continued to record new material. In 1999, he embarked on a three-month North American tour with Bob Dylan, in which he and Dylan alternated as the headline act with a middle section where they performed together. The collaboration was generally well-received, with just one critic, Seth Rogovoy of the \"Berkshire Eagle\", questioning the collaboration.\nIn 2000, Simon wrote and recorded a new album, \"You're the One\", very quickly. The album was released in October and consisted mostly of folk-pop writing combined with foreign musical sounds, particularly grooves from North Africa. The album received favorable reviews, reached both the British and American Top 20, and received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. Simon toured extensively to promote it, and one performance in Paris was released to home video. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in America, Simon sang \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" on \"\", a multi-network broadcast to benefit the September 11 Telethon Fund, and performed \"The Boxer\" at the start of the first episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" after September 11. In 2002, he wrote and recorded \"Father and Daughter\", the theme song for the animated family film \"The Wild Thornberrys Movie\". The track was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song.\nIn 2003, Simon and Garfunkel performed together again when they received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. This reunion led to a U.S. tour, the acclaimed \"Old Friends\" concert series, followed by a 2004 international encore, culminating in a free concert at the Colosseum in Rome that attracted an audience of 600,000. In 2005, they sang \"Mrs. Robinson\" and \"Homeward Bound\" together, plus \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" with Aaron Neville, in the benefit concert \"From the Big Apple to The Big Easy \u2013 The Concert for New Orleans\" (eventually released as a DVD) for Hurricane Katrina victims. In 2004, Simon's studio albums were re-released both individually and as a collection in a limited-edition, nine-CD boxed set, \"Paul Simon: The Studio Recordings 1972\u20132000\". Simon was then working with Brian Eno on a new album, \"Surprise\", which was released in May 2006. Most of its songs were inspired by the September 11 attacks and the Iraq War. Simon also took inspiration from having turned 60 in 2001, which he humorously referred to in \"Old\" from \"You're the One\". \"Surprise\" was a commercial hit, reaching number 14 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and number 4 in the UK. Most critics praised the album. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote, \"Simon doesn't achieve his comeback by reconnecting with the sound and spirit of his classic work; he has achieved it by being as restless and ambitious as he was at his popular and creative peak.\" The album was supported by the Surprise Tour in 2006.\nIn March 2004, Walter Yetnikoff published \"Howling at the Moon\", a book in which he criticized Simon and his previous business partnership with Columbia Records. In 2007, Simon was the inaugural recipient of the Library of Congress's Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, and he later performed as part of a gala of his work.\n2008\u20132013: \"So Beautiful or So What\" and touring.\nAfter living in Montauk, New York, for many years, Simon relocated to New Canaan, Connecticut. He is one of a small number of performers who are named as the copyright owner on their recordings (most records have the recording company as the named owner). This development followed the Bee Gees' successful $200-million lawsuit against RSO Records, the largest successful suit against a record company by an artist or group. All of Simon's solo recordings, including those originally issued by Columbia Records, are distributed by Sony Records' Legacy Recordings unit. His albums were issued by Warner Music Group until mid-2010, when Simon moved his catalog of solo work from Warner Bros. Records to Sony/Columbia Records, which holds the Simon &amp; Garfunkel catalog.\nIn April 2008, \"Songs From the Capeman\" played at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with original cast members and the Spanish Harlem Orchestra. Simon appeared during the BAM shows, performing \"Trailways Bus\" and \"Late in the Evening\". In February 2009, Simon performed back-to-back shows in New York City at the recently renovated Beacon Theatre. He was joined by Garfunkel and the cast of \"The Capeman\" in the first show. The band included \"Graceland\" bassist Bakithi Kumalo. In May 2009, Simon toured with Garfunkel in Australia, New Zealand and Japan, and in October they appeared together at the 25th Anniversary Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Concerts. At that concert, Simon duetted with Dion on \"The Wanderer\" and with Graham Nash and David Crosby on \"Here Comes the Sun\". In April 2010, Simon &amp; Garfunkel performed together again at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival. In August 2010, \"The Capeman\" was staged for three nights in the Delacorte Theatre in New York's Central Park. The production was directed by Diane Paulus and produced in conjunction with the Public Theater.\nSimon released a new song, \"Getting Ready for Christmas Day\", on November 10, 2010. The song sampled a 1941 sermon by J. M. Gates and premiered on National Public Radio Simon performed the song on \"The Colbert Report\" on December 16, 2010. In the first show of the final season of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" on September 10, 2010, Simon performed a song that commemorated the show's 25 years, an update of a song he wrote for its 10th anniversary. Simon's next album, \"So Beautiful or So What\", was released on the Concord Music Group label on April 12, 2011, and Simon said it was the best work he had done in 20 years. It was reported that he had wanted to have Bob Dylan perform on the album. At the end of his 2011 World Tour, which included the U.S., the UK, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Germany, Simon appeared at Ramat Gan Stadium in Israel in July 2011, his first concert appearance in Israel since 1983. On the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, he performed \"The Sound of Silence\" at the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum in New York, on the site of the destroyed World Trade Center.\nOn February 26, 2012, Simon paid tribute to fellow musicians Chuck Berry and Leonard Cohen, who had received the first annual PEN Awards for songwriting excellence at the JFK Presidential Library. In 2012, Simon released a 25th-anniversary box set of \"Graceland\" that included a remastered edition of the original album; the 2012 documentary film \"Under African Skies;\" the original 1987 \"African Concert\" from Zimbabwe; an audio narrative, \"The Story of Graceland\", related by Simon; and other interviews and memorabilia. He played a few concerts in Europe with the original musicians to commemorate the anniversary. On December 19, 2012, Simon performed at the funeral of Victoria Leigh Soto, a teacher killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. In September 2013, he delivered the Richard Ellmann Lecture in Modern Literature at Emory University.\n2014\u20132022: \"Stranger to Stranger\" and \"In the Blue Light\".\nIn 2014, Simon embarked on a joint 21-date concert tour of North America, On Stage Together, with English musician Sting. The tour continued in 2015 with ten shows in Australia and New Zealand and 23 in Europe.\nSimon made a surprise appearance in \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" on September 11, 2015. He performed \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\" with Colbert, having been billed before the show as a Simon &amp; Garfunkel Tribute Band. He also performed \"American Tune\", which was posted on the show's YouTube channel. In 2015, Dion released the single \"New York Is My Home\" with Simon.\nSimon wrote and performed the theme song for comedian Louis C.K.'s show \"Horace and Pete\", which debuted on January 30, 2016. The song is heard during the show's opening, intermission, and closing credits and features Simon's voice and acoustic guitar. Simon made a cameo appearance onscreen in the series' final episode. On June 3, 2016, he released his 13th solo studio album, \"Stranger to Stranger\", on Concord Records\".\"\nIn 2011, Simon was introduced to Italian electronic dance music artist Clap! Clap! by his son, Adrian, who was a fan of his work. They met in 2011 when Simon was touring \"So Beautiful or So What\" in Italy. Simon collaborated with him on three songs, and also worked with longtime friend Roy Halee, who co-produced the album. After the release of the album, Simon said he was no longer interested in showbiz and talked about retirement. He said, \"I am going to see what happens if I let go\". In the 2010s he appeared briefly in shows such as \"Portlandia\", \"Welcome to Sweden\" and \"Horace &amp; Pete\". He appeared as an interviewee and as a musical guest on talk shows such as \"The Dick Cavett Show\", \"Late Night with David Letterman\", \"The Late Show with David Letterman\", \"The Colbert Report\", \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" and \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\". He was the subject of two films by Jeremy Marre on the making of \"Graceland\" and \"The Capeman\".\nSimon performed \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 25, 2016. He debuted a new version of \"Questions for the Angels\" with jazz guitarist Bill Frisell on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" on May 24, 2017. On February 5, 2018, Simon announced his intention to retire from touring, citing time away from his family and the death of longtime guitarist Vincent Nguini. He did not rule out performing live again. He began a farewell concert tour, Homeward Bound \u2013 The Farewell Tour, in May 2018 in Vancouver, Canada, and performed shows across North America and Europe. He played his final concert in Queens, New York, on September 22, 2018.\nIn 2018, Simon released his 14th solo studio album, \"In the Blue Light\", which consisted of re-recordings of lesser-known songs from his catalog, some with altered arrangements, harmonic structures and lyrics. On August 11, 2019, he returned to live performance when he closed San Francisco's \"Outside Lands\" festival in Golden Gate Park. He said he planned to donate his net proceeds to local environmental nonprofit organizations. \"American Songwriter\" honored Dion's \"Song for Sam Cooke (Here in America)\", featuring Simon, as the \"Greatest of the Great 2020 Songs\". Simon sold his music publishing catalog to Sony Music Publishing in March 2021. He was previously signed to Universal Music Publishing Group.\n2023\u2013present: \"Seven Psalms\" and return to touring.\nSimon released a new album, \"Seven Psalms\", in April 2023. A documentary of the project, \"\", was made by Alex Gibney. The album was described as 33 minutes of uninterrupted musical meditation, consisting of seven pieces performed on acoustic guitar, linked by a motif derived from \"Anji\", with elements of folk, blues, and jazz, and lyrics that reflect on life, death, and faith. The inspiration for the album came to Simon in 2020. He recalled, \"I had a dream so vivid it made me get up in the middle of the night and write it down ... a voice said 'You are meant to be working on a piece called 'Seven Psalms'.\" For the next few months, isolated by the COVID-19 pandemic on a Texas ranch, Simon worked on a series of guitar pieces and added sounds like distant church bells produced by amplified upside-down wine glasses. He said, \"I envisioned \"Seven Psalms\" as one long thought, combined with sounds powerful enough to make the thought come alive.\" In December 2023, Simon rehearsed \"Seven Psalms\" with two acoustic guitarists. He said he missed performing and hoped that it might be possible to play the album live.\nSimon had planned to retire from music, but after the success of \"Seven Psalms\", he completed another song, composed four more guitar pieces, and was planning an album of duets with his wife, singer Edie Brickell. He was also in the early stages of working on a musical. In a May 2023 interview with \"The Times\", he said he had lost most of the hearing in his left ear. In February 2025, Simon performed \"Homeward Bound\" with Sabrina Carpenter at a 50th-anniversary special for \"Saturday Night Live\". That month, he announced the Quiet Celebration Tour, comprising performances in smaller venues in 20 cities across the U.S. and Canada and multiple nights in a row in most cities. The tour began with two shows at the Saenger Theater on April 4 and 5 in New Orleans and ended with two filmed shows at McCaw Hall in Seattle on August 5 and 6, 2025.\nSongwriting.\nIn 2012, in an interview reprinted in \"American Songwriter\", Simon discussed the craft of songwriting with music journalist Tom Moon and talked about the basic themes in his songwriting\u2014love, family, social commentary, religion, spirituality, and God. He said: \"The music always precedes the words. The words often come from the sound of the music and eventually evolve into coherent thoughts. Or incoherent thoughts. Rhythm plays a crucial part in the lyric-making as well. It's like a puzzle to find the right words to express what the music is saying.\"\n\"Saturday Night Live\".\nSimon was the host of the second episode of \"SNL\", on October 18, 1975. Simon appeared alongside George Harrison on the Thanksgiving Day episode of \"SNL\" on November 20, 1976, and they performed \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Homeward Bound\" together. Simon opened the show in a comedy sketch in which he performed \"Still Crazy After All These Years,\" in a turkey outfit, Thanksgiving being the following week. Halfway through the song, he told the band to stop playing because he was embarrassed, gave a speech to the audience and left the stage. Lorne Michaels greeted him backstage, but Simon, still acting upset, yelled at him because of the humiliating turkey outfit. This was one of \"SNL\"'s most replayed sketches.\nIn one \"SNL\" skit from 1986, when he was promoting \"Graceland\", Simon played himself waiting in line with a friend to get into a movie. He amazed his friend by remembering intricate details about prior meetings with passers-by, but drew a complete blank when he was approached by Art Garfunkel. When Simon hosted an \"SNL\" episode during the 1988 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Simon walked out with Illinois Senator and presidential candidate Paul Simon, and argued about which Paul Simon was supposed to have hosting duties.\nOn September 29, 2001, Simon played \"The Boxer\" as the cold open for the first episode of \"SNL\" to air after the September 11 attacks, also the first episode of its 2001-2002 season.\nSimon closed the 40th anniversary \"SNL\" show on February 15, 2015, with a performance of \"Still Crazy After All These Years\". He played a snippet of \"I've Just Seen a Face\" with Sir Paul McCartney during the introductory sequence. Much of the Thanksgiving episode from 1976 was shown during this prime-time special. On October 13, 2018, he was the musical guest on his 77th birthday. His most recent \"SNL\" appearance was on February 16, 2025, Paul Simon performed \"Homeward Bound\" alongside Sabrina Carpenter for the opening of the \"Saturday Night Live 50th Anniversary Special\".\nAwards, legacy and honors.\nSimon has earned sixteen Grammy Awards for his solo and collaborative work, including three for Album of the Year (\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\", 1971; \"Still Crazy After All These Years\", 1976\";\" and \"Graceland\", 1988), and a Lifetime Achievement Award. He is one of only eight artists to have won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year more than once as the main credited artist. In 1998, Simon was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for the Simon &amp; Garfunkel album \"Bridge over Troubled Water\". In 2002, he received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song for his song \"Father and Daughter\".\nSimon has twice been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: in 1990 as a member of Simon &amp; Garfunkel; and in 2001 for his solo career. In 2011, \"Rolling Stone\" named him one of the 100 greatest guitarists, and in 2015 he was ranked 8th in their list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. In 2023, he was ranked the 246th greatest guitarist of all time by \"Rolling Stone\". In 2001, Simon was honored as MusiCares Person of the Year. In 2002 he was one of five recipients of the annual Kennedy Center Honors, the nation's highest tribute to performing and cultural artists. In 2005, Simon was honored at the BMI Pop Awards. His songwriting catalog had earned 39 BMI Awards, including numerous citations for \"Bridge over Troubled Water\", \"Mrs. Robinson\", \"Scarborough Fair\" and \"The Sound of Silence\". In 2006, he was selected by \"Time Magazine\" as one of the \"100 People Who Shaped the World\".\nIn 2007, Simon received the first annual Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. Named in honor of George and Ira Gershwin, this award recognized the profound and positive effect of popular music on the world's culture. Simon said, \"I am grateful to be the recipient of the Gershwin Prize and doubly honored to be the first. I look forward to spending an evening in the company of artists I admire at the award ceremony in May. I can think of a few [artists] who have expressed my words and music far better than I [have]. I'm excited at the prospect of that happening again. It's a songwriter's dream come true.\" Among the performers who paid tribute to Simon were Stevie Wonder, Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Lyle Lovett, James Taylor, Dianne Reeves, Marc Anthony, Yolanda Adams and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The event was professionally filmed and broadcast and was released as \"Paul Simon and Friends\". In 2012, Simon was awarded the Polar Music Prize.\nPersonal life.\nRelationships and marriages.\nWhen Simon moved to England in 1964, he met Kathleen Mary \"Kathy\" Chitty at the first English folk club he played, the Railway Inn Folk Club in Brentwood, Essex, where Chitty worked part-time selling tickets. She was 18 and he was 22 when they began a relationship. Later that year they visited the U.S. together, mainly touring by bus. Kathy returned to England and Simon followed some weeks later. When he returned to the U.S. with the growing success of \"The Sounds of Silence\", Kathy, who was quite shy, wanted no part in success and fame, and they ended their relationship. She is mentioned by name in at least two of Simon's songs, \"Kathy's Song\" and \"America\". She is also referred to in \"Homeward Bound\" and \"The Late Great Johnny Ace\". A photo of Simon and Kathy is on the cover of Simon's 1965 album \"The Paul Simon Songbook\".\nPeggy Harper.\nSimon has been married three times, first to Peggy Harper in 1969. They had a son, Harper Simon, in 1972, and divorced in 1975, inspiring the song \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\". Simon wrote about this relationship in the song \"Train in the Distance\" from his 1983 album \"Hearts and Bones\". In the late 1970s, Simon lived in New York City next door to \"Saturday Night Live\" creator Lorne Michaels, who has been described as Simon's \"best friend\" during the period.\nCarrie Fisher.\nSimon met actress Shelley Duvall while filming \"Annie Hall\" in 1976. They lived together as a couple for two years until Duvall introduced him to her friend actress Carrie Fisher. Simon and Fisher began dating in 1978, and were married from 1983 to 1984. He proposed to her after a New York Yankees game. The song \"Hearts and Bones\" is about their time together, and the song \"Graceland\" is believed to be about seeking solace from the end of the relationship by taking a road trip. A year after they divorced, Simon and Fisher resumed their relationship, which lasted several years.\nEdie Brickell.\nSimon married singer Edie Brickell on May 30, 1992. Brickell and Simon have three children, Adrian, Lulu, and Gabriel. On April 26, 2014, Simon and Brickell were involved in a domestic dispute in which police responded to their Connecticut residence. Each was issued a summons to appear in court on disorderly conduct charges.\nFamily and interests.\nAll four of his children are now adults and are musicians. Simon and his younger brother, Eddie Simon, founded the Guitar Study Center sometime before 1973. The Guitar Study Center became part of The New School in New York City, sometime before 2002.\nSimon is an avid fan of the New York Rangers ice hockey team, the New York Knicks basketball team and the New York Yankees baseball team.\nPhilanthropy.\nSimon is an advocate of music education for children. In 1970, after recording \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\", he held auditions for a young songwriters' workshop at the invitation of the NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. The auditions were advertised in \"The Village Voice\", and brought hundreds of hopefuls to perform. Among the six teenage songwriters selected for tutelage were Melissa Manchester, Tommy Mandel and rock/beat poet Joe Linus. Maggie and Terre Roche (the Roche Sisters), who later sang back-up for Simon, joined the workshop in progress in an impromptu appearance.\nSimon invited the six teenagers to experience the recording process at Columbia studios with engineer Roy Halee. During these sessions, Bob Dylan was downstairs recording his album \"Self-Portrait\", which included a version of Simon's \"The Boxer\". Violinist Isaac Stern visited the group with a CBS film crew and spoke to the young musicians about lyrics and music. Manchester later paid homage to Simon with her recorded song \"Ode to Paul\". Other musicians Simon mentored include Nick Laird-Clowes, who co-founded the band the Dream Academy. Laird-Clowes credited Simon with helping to shape the band's biggest hit, \"Life in a Northern Town\".\nIn 2003, Simon became a supporter of Little Kids Rock, a nonprofit organization that provided free musical instruments and free lessons to children in public schools in the U.S. He sits on the organization's board of directors as an honorary member. Simon is also a major benefactor and one of the co-founders, with Irwin Redlener, of the Children's Health Project and The Children's Health Fund which began by creating specially equipped buses to take medical care to children in medically under-served areas, both urban and rural. Their first bus was placed in the impoverished South Bronx of New York City, but the buses now operate in 12 states, including on the Gulf Coast. The project has expanded greatly and partners with major hospitals, local public schools and medical schools, and advocates policy for children's health and medical care.\nIn May 2012, Paul Simon performed at a benefit dinner for the Turkana Basin Institute in New York City, raising more than $2\u00a0million for Richard Leakey's research institute in Africa. For his 2019 performance at San Francisco's Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival, Simon donated his appearance fee to the San Francisco Parks Alliance and Friends of the Urban Forest. After reading Peter Singer's book \"The Life You Can Save\", Simon became a supporter of effective altruism, a movement that uses evidence to determine where charitable giving has the greatest impact. He reflects, \u201cYou really have to know what and to whom you\u2019re giving this money. All these years I had been doing these benefit concerts with all my friends and musicians. We\u2019d come. We\u2019d play. We pack up our guitars. We leave. And nobody ever says, \u2018Where\u2019d that money go?\u2019\u201d In 2015, he performed a benefit concert for the Fistula Foundation.\nDiscography.\nThis discography does not include compilation albums, concert albums or work with Simon &amp; Garfunkel.\nSimon's solo concert albums often have songs he originally recorded with Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and many Simon &amp; Garfunkel concert albums contain songs Simon first recorded on solo albums.\nSimon has a few songs that appear on compilation albums and nowhere else, such as \"Slip Slidin' Away\", which first appeared on the compilation album \"Greatest Hits, Etc.\" (1977) and has since been included in subsequent compilations such as \"Negotiations and Love Songs\" (1988).\nSolo studio albums\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "50748", "revid": "42664955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50748", "title": "Paris M\u00e9tro", "text": "Rapid transit system of Paris, France\nThe Paris M\u00e9tro, short for M\u00e9tropolitain, is a rapid transit system serving the Paris metropolitan area in France. A symbol of the city, it is known for its density within the capital's territorial limits, as well as its uniform architecture and historical entrances influenced by Art Nouveau. The system is long, mostly underground, as well as its 321 stations of which 61 allow the riders to transfer between the sixteen lines (with an additional four under construction and one in project), all numbered 1 to 14, with two extra branches, 3bis and 7bis, named such as they are former parts of Lines 3 and 7 respectively. Three of these lines (1, 4 and 14) are fully automated, and the additional four are also planned as such. Lines are identified on maps by an individual number and an associated specific colour, all part of an official palette, with the traveling direction indicated by the terminus, the last stop on each line. All trains travel from one end of the line to the other, serving every station along the way. The Paris M\u00e9tro is operated by the \"R\u00e9gie autonome des transports parisiens\" (RATP), which also operates part of the RER (commuter standard train) network, most of the Francilian light rail lines and many bus routes around and within Paris itself.\nIt is the second-busiest metro system in Europe, as well as the twelfth-busiest in the world. It carried 1.476 billion passengers in 2024, roughly 4.04 million passengers a day, which makes it the most used public transport system in Paris. It is one of the densest metro systems in the world, with 244 stations within the of the City of Paris. Ch\u00e2telet\u2013Les Halles, with five M\u00e9tro and three RER commuter rail lines, is one of the world's largest metro stations. The system generally has poor accessibility due to its old age (established 125 years ago) and because most of the current infrastructure was built before accessibility standards emerged, with few stations retrofitted since. On the flip side, all new infrastructure and rolling stock meets current accessiblity standards, including extensions of historic lines.\nThe first line opened without ceremony on 19 July 1900, during the World's Fair (). The system expanded quickly until World War I and the core was complete by the 1920s. Extensions into the suburbs were started in the 1930s. The network reached saturation after World War II and new trains were built in order to allow higher traffic, but further improvements were limited by the network's design and, in particular, the short distances between stations. In 1998, Line 14 was opened with the intention to relieve RER A. Eastbound extension of Line 11 towards Rosny\u2013Bois-Perrier in 2024, is the network's most recent extension. A large expansion program known as the Grand Paris Express (GPE) is currently under construction with four new orbital M\u00e9tro lines (named lines 15, 16, 17 and 18) around the \u00cele-de-France region, outside the limits of Paris, in order to alleviate the traffic on the near-exclusively radial historic network. Further plans exist for Line 1 east, Line 7 north, Line 10 east, Line 12 south and a merger of Lines 3bis and 7bis, as well as a new proposed Line 19 in the city's northernmost urbanized suburbs.\nBesides the M\u00e9tro, central Paris and its urban area are served by five RER lines (602\u00a0km or 374\u00a0mi with 257 stations), fourteen tramway lines (186.6\u00a0km or 115.9\u00a0mi with 278 stations), nine Transilien suburban trains (1,299\u00a0km or 807\u00a0mi with 392 stations), in addition to three VAL lines at Charles de Gaulle Airport and Orly Airport. This makes Paris one of the cities in the world best served by public transportation. Despite the network's uniform architecture, several of its stations stand out at the hand of their unique design. The M\u00e9tro itself has become an icon in popular culture, being frequently featured in cinema and mentioned in music. In 2021, the RATP started offering an umbrella lending service at several M\u00e9tro and RER stations, highlighting the M\u00e9tro's own rabbit mascot, which advises children on staying away from the closing doors.\nNaming.\nM\u00e9tro is the abbreviated name of the company that originally operated most of the network: the Empain group subsidiary \"Compagnie du chemin de fer m\u00e9tropolitain de Paris S.A.\" (\"Paris Metropolitan Railway Company Ltd\"), also known as CMP. The name was directly inspired by the 1863 London Metropolitan Railway (\"\"), which had been commonly abbreviated as \"m\u00e9tropolitain\" in French since the late Second Empire.\nCMP was known as \"Le M\u00e9tropolitain\", which quickly became abbreviated to \"M\u00e9tro,\" which became a common designation and brand name for rapid transit systems in France and elsewhere. 'Metro' has been adopted in many languages, making it the most used word for an urban rapid transit system.\nThe M\u00e9tro is operated by the \"R\u00e9gie autonome des transports parisiens\" (RATP), a public transport authority that also operates part of the RER network, light rail lines and many bus routes.\nHistory.\nBy 1845, Paris and the railway companies were already thinking about an urban railway system to link inner districts of the city. The railway companies and the French government wanted to extend mainline railways into a new underground network, whereas the Parisians favoured a new and independent network and feared national takeover of any system it built. The disagreement lasted from 1856 to 1890. Meanwhile, the population became denser and traffic congestion grew massively. The deadlock put pressure on the authorities and gave the city the green light.\nPrior to 1845, the urban transport network consisted primarily of a large number of omnibus lines, consolidated by the French government into a regulated system with fixed and unconflicting routes and schedules. The first concrete proposal for an urban rail system in Paris was put forward by civil engineer Florence de K\u00e9rizouet. This plan called for a surface cable car system. In 1855, civil engineers Edouard Brame and Eug\u00e8ne Flachat proposed an underground freight urban railway, due to the high rate of accidents on surface rail lines. On 19 November 1871 the General Council of the Seine commissioned a team of 40 engineers to plan an urban rail network. This team proposed a network with a pattern of routes \"resembling a cross enclosed in a circle\" with axial routes following large boulevards. On 11 May 1872 the Council endorsed the plan, but the French government turned down the plan. After this point, a serious debate occurred over whether the new system should consist of elevated lines or of mostly underground lines; this debate involved numerous parties in France, including Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant, and the Eiffel Society of Gustave Eiffel, and continued until 1892. Eventually the underground option emerged as the preferred solution because of the high cost of buying land for rights-of-way in central Paris required for elevated lines, estimated at 70,000 francs per metre of line for a -wide railway.\nThe last remaining hurdle was the city's concern about national interference in its urban rail system. The city commissioned renowned engineer Jean-Baptiste Berlier, who designed Paris's postal network of pneumatic tubes, to design and plan its rail system in the early 1890s. Berlier recommended a special track gauge of (versus the standard gauge of ) to protect the system from national takeover, which inflamed the issue substantially. The issue was finally settled when the Minister of Public Works begrudgingly recognised the city's right to build a local system on 22 November 1895, and by the city's secret designing of the trains and tunnels to be too narrow for mainline trains, while adopting standard gauge as a compromise with the state.\nFulgence Bienven\u00fce project.\nOn 20 April 1896, Paris adopted the Fulgence Bienven\u00fce project, which was to serve only the city proper of Paris. Many Parisians worried that extending lines to industrial suburbs would reduce the safety of the city. Paris forbade lines to the inner suburbs and, as a guarantee, M\u00e9tro trains were to run on the right, as opposed to existing suburban lines, which ran on the left.\nUnlike many other subway systems (such as that of London), this system was designed from the outset as a unified system, initially of nine lines. Such a large project required a private-public arrangement right from the outset \u2013 the city would build most of the permanent way, while a private concessionaire company would supply the trains and power stations, and lease the system (each line separately, for initially 39-year leases). In July 1897, six bidders competed, and The Compagnie Generale de Traction, owned by the Belgian Baron \u00c9douard Empain,\nwon the contract; this company was then immediately reorganised as the Compagnie du chemin de fer m\u00e9tropolitain.\nConstruction began in November 1898. The first line, Porte Maillot\u2013Porte de Vincennes, was inaugurated on 19 July 1900 during the Paris World's Fair. Entrances to stations were designed in Art Nouveau style by Hector Guimard. Eighty-six of his entrances are still in existence.\nBienven\u00fce's project consisted of 10 lines, which correspond to current Lines 1 to\u00a09. Construction was so intense that by 1920, despite a few changes from schedule, most lines had been completed. The shield method of construction was rejected in favor of the cut-and-cover method in order to speed up work. Bienven\u00fce, a highly regarded engineer, designed a special procedure of building the tunnels to allow the swift repaving of roads, and is credited with a largely swift and relatively uneventful construction through the difficult and heterogeneous soils and rocks.\nLine 1 and Line 4 were conceived as central east\u2013west and north\u2013south lines. Two lines, \"ligne 2 Nord\" (Line 2 North) and \"ligne 2 Sud\" (Line 2 South), were also planned but Line 2 South was merged with Line\u00a05 in 1906. Line\u00a03 was an additional east\u2013west line to the north of line 1 and line 5 an additional north to south line to the east of Line\u00a04. Line\u00a06 would run from Nation to Place d'Italie. Lines\u00a07, 8 and 9 would connect commercial and office districts around the Op\u00e9ra to residential areas in the north-east and the south-west. Bienven\u00fce also planned a circular line, the \"ligne circulaire int\u00e9rieure\", to connect the six mainline stations. A section opened in 1923 between Invalides and the Boulevard Saint-Germain before the plan was abandoned.\nNord-Sud competing network.\nOn 31 January 1904, a second concession was granted to the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du chemin de fer \u00e9lectrique souterrain Nord-Sud de Paris\" (Paris North-South underground electrical railway company), abbreviated to the \"Nord-Sud\" (North-South) company. It was responsible for building three proposed lines:\nLine A was inaugurated on 4 November 1910, after being postponed because of floods in January that year. Line B was inaugurated on 26 February 1911. Because of the high construction costs, the construction of line C was postponed. Nord-Sud and CMP used compatible trains that could be used on both networks, but CMP trains used 600 volts third rail, and NS \u2212600 volts overhead wire and +600 volts third rail. This was necessary because of steep gradients on NS lines. NS distinguished itself from its competitor with the high-quality decoration of its stations, the trains' extreme comfort and pretty lighting.\nNord-Sud did not become profitable and bankruptcy became unavoidable. By the end of 1930, the CMP bought Nord-Sud. Line A became Line 12 and Line B Line\u00a013. Line C was built and renamed Line\u00a014, then was reorganised in 1937 alongside Lines 8 and 10. This former line 14 is now the southern part of Line\u00a013.\nThe last Nord-Sud train set was decommissioned on 15 May 1972.\n1930\u20131950: first inner suburbs are reached.\nBienven\u00fce's project was nearly completed during the 1920s. Paris planned three new lines and extensions of most lines to the inner suburbs, despite the reluctance of Parisians. Bienven\u00fce's inner circular line having been abandoned, the already-built portion between Duroc and Od\u00e9on for the creation of a new east\u2013west line that became Line 10, extended west to Porte de Saint-Cloud and the inner suburbs of Boulogne.\nThe line C planned by Nord-Sud between Montparnasse station and Porte de Vanves was built as Line 14 (different from present Line\u00a014). It extended north in encompassing the already-built portion between Invalides and Duroc, initially planned as part of the inner circular. The saturated Belleville funicular tramway would be replaced by a new line, Line 11, extended to Ch\u00e2telet. Lines 10, 11 and 14 were thus the three new lines envisaged under this plan.\nMost lines would eventually en up extended to the inner suburbs. The first to leave the city proper was Line 9, extended in 1934 to Boulogne-Billancourt; followed by Lines 12 south and 1 east in 1934. World War II forced authorities to abandon projects such as the extension of Lines 4 and 12 to the northern suburbs. By 1949, eight lines had been extended: Line 1 to Neuilly-sur-Seine, Line 3 to Levallois-Perret, Line 5 to Pantin, Line 7 to Ivry-sur-Seine, Line 8 to Charenton, Line 9 to Boulogne-Billancourt, Line 11 to Les Lilas and Line 12 to Issy-les-Moulineaux.\nWorld War II had a massive impact on the M\u00e9tro. Services were limited and many stations closed. The risk of bombing meant the service between Place d'Italie and \u00c9toile was transferred from Line 5 to Line\u00a06, so that most of the elevated portions of the M\u00e9tro would be on Line 6. As a result, Lines 2 and 6 now form a circle. Most stations were too shallow to be used as bomb shelters. The French Resistance used the tunnels to conduct swift assaults throughout Paris.\nIt took a long time to recover after liberation in 1944. Many stations, such as Li\u00e8ge, had not reopened by the 1960s while some others, such as Champ de Mars and Saint-Martin, never reopened. On 23 March 1948, the CMP (the underground) and the STCRP (bus and tramways) merged to form the RATP, still running the M\u00e9tro and most of Paris's public transportation services today.\n1960\u20131990: development of the RER.\nThe network grew saturated during the 1950s. Outdated technology limited the number of trains, which led the RATP to stop extending lines and concentrate on modernisation. The MP\u00a051 prototype was built, testing both rubber-tyred metro and basic automatic driving on the \"voie navette\". The first replacements of the older Sprague trains began with experimental articulated trains and then with mainstream rubber-tyred M\u00e9tro MP\u00a055 and MP\u00a059, some of the latter having only retired in 2025. Thanks to newer trains and better signalling, trains ran more frequently.\nThe population boomed from 1950 to 1980. Car ownership became more common and suburbs grew further from the centre of Paris. The main railway stations, termini of the suburban rail lines, were overcrowded during rush hour. The short distance between M\u00e9tro stations slowed the network and made it unprofitable to build extensions. The solution in the 1960s was to revive a project abandoned at the end of the 19th century: joining suburban lines together through new express underground portions in the city centre : the R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional (regional express network; RER).\nThe RER plan initially included one east\u2013west line and two north\u2013south lines. RATP bought two unprofitable SNCF lines\u2014the Ligne de Saint-Germain (westbound) and the Ligne de Vincennes (eastbound) with the intention of joining them and to serve multiple districts of central Paris with new underground stations. The new line created by this merger became Line\u00a0A. The Ligne de Sceaux, which served the southern suburbs and was bought by the CMP in the 1930s, would be extended north to merge with a line of the SNCF and reach the new Charles de Gaulle Airport in Roissy. This became Line\u00a0B. These new lines were inaugurated in 1977 and their wild success outperformed the most optimistic forecasts, so much so that RER line A is the most used urban rail line in Europe with nearly 300\u00a0million journeys a year.\nBecause of the enormous cost of these two lines, the third planned line was abandoned and the authorities decided that later developments of the RER network would be more cheaply developed by the SNCF, alongside its continued management of other suburban lines. However, the RER developed by the SNCF would never match the success of the RATP's two RER lines. In 1979, the SNCF developed Line C by joining the suburban lines of the Gare d'Austerlitz and Gare d'Orsay, the latter being converted into a museum dedicated to impressionist paintings. During the 1980s, it developed Line\u00a0D, which was the second line planned by the initial RER schedule, but serving Ch\u00e2telet instead of R\u00e9publique to reduce costs. A huge M\u00e9tro-RER hub was created at Ch\u00e2telet\u2013Les Halles, becoming one of the world's largest underground stations.\nThe same project of the 1960s also decided to merge subway Lines 13 and 14 to create a quick connection between Saint-Lazare and Montparnasse as a new north\u2013south line. Distances between stations on the lengthened line 13 differ from that on other lines in order to make it more \"express\" and hence to extend it farther in the suburbs. The new Line\u00a013 was inaugurated on 9 November 1976.\n1990\u20132010: Eole and M\u00e9t\u00e9or.\nIn October 1998, the current day Line 14 was inaugurated on its central trunk (from Saint-Lazare to Biblioth\u00e8que Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand stations). It was the first fully new M\u00e9tro line in 63 years. Known during its conception as \"M\u00e9t\u00e9or\" (M\u00c9Tro Est-Ouest Rapide), it was the first of the now three fully automatic lines within the network, along with Lines 1 and 4. It was also the first line of the Parisian network to feature platform screen doors on every station on opening day to prevent suicides and accidents. It was conceived with suburban extension in mind, similar to the Line 13 extensions built during the 1970s. As a result, most of the stations are at least a kilometre apart. Like the RER lines designed by the RATP, nearly all stations offer connections with multiple M\u00e9tro lines.\nLines 13 and 7 are the only two on the network to be split in branches. Hoping to get rid of those saturated branches and thus improve the network's efficiency, RATP had initially planned to attribute to line 14 one branch of each line (most probably the Asni\u00e8res-Gennevilliers and Villejuif branches), then extend them both further into the suburbs. This project was abandoned due to the cost of modernizing the allotted branches. In 1999, the RER Line E was inaugurated. Known during its conception as Eole (Est-Ouest Liaison Express), it is the fifth RER line. Originally terminating at Haussmann\u2013Saint-Lazare station, it was extended west in early 2025 towards Nanterre, through the La D\u00e9fense business district, with an extension west through \"stealing\" the Mantes-la-Jolie branch of Transilien line J, in mind and on papers.\n2010 and beyond: automation.\nBetween 2007 and November 2011, Line 1 was converted to driverless operation. The line was operated with a combination of driver-operated trains and driverless trains until the last driverless MP 05 train joined in February 2013. The same conversion for Line 4 was completed on 13 January 2022, with the last non-automatic train removed from that line to Line 6 on 17 December 2023, with plans to automate Line 13. Line 14 was automated from Day 1, as will the upcoming lines 15 to 18 part of the Grand Paris Express.\nSeveral of the historic lines were extended through the suburbs since 2010 :\nNetwork.\nSince the M\u00e9tro was built to comprehensively serve the city inside its walls, the stations are very close: apart on average, from on historical Line 4 to on the modern line 14, meaning Paris is densely networked with stations. The surrounding suburbs are served by later line extensions, forcing all m\u00e9tro traffic from one suburb to another to pass through the city (the circular line 15, now under construction, will enable non-radial journeys through Paris). The slow average speed effectively prohibits service to the greater Paris area.\nThe M\u00e9tro is mostly underground ( of ). Above-ground sections consist of elevated railway viaducts within Paris (on Lines 1, 2, 5 and 6) and the at-level suburban ends of Lines 1, 5, 8, and 13. The tunnels are relatively close to the surface due to the variable nature of the terrain, which complicates deep digging; exceptions include parts of Line 12 under the hill of Montmartre and line 2 under M\u00e9nilmontant. The tunnels mostly follow the twists and turns of the streets above. During construction in 1900, a minimum curvature radius of was imposed, but even this low standard was not adhered to at Bastille and Notre-Dame-de-Lorette.\nLike the New York City Subway, and in contrast with the London Underground, the Paris M\u00e9tro mostly uses two-way tunnels. As in most French metro and tramway systems, trains drive on the right, while SNCF trains run on the left. The tracks are . Electric power is supplied by a third rail which carries 750 volts DC.\nThe width of the carriages, , is narrower than that of newer French systems (such as the carriages in Lyon). Trains on Lines 1, 4 and 14 have capacities of 600\u2013700 passengers, compared with the 2,600 riders capacity on the Alt\u00e9o MI 2N trains of RER A. The City of Paris deliberately chose to build narrow M\u00e9tro tunnels to prevent the running of mainline trains, as the city of Paris and the French state had historically poor relations. In contrast to many other historical metro systems (such as New York, Madrid, London, and Boston), all lines have tunnels and operate trains with the same dimensions. Five Paris M\u00e9tro Lines (1, 4, 6, 11 and 14) run on a rubber tire system developed by the RATP in the 1950s, and since exported to the Montreal, Santiago, Mexico City and Lausanne metro networks.\nThe number of cars of each train varies line by line. The shortest are lines 3bis and 7bis with three-car trains. Line 11 ran with four until the summer 2024 when four-car MP 59 trains, the oldest type in service at the time, were gradually replaced by new five-car MP 14 trains. Lines 1 and 4 run six-car trains. Line 14 runs 8-car trains. All other lines run with five. Two lines, 7 and 13, have branches at the end, and Line 10 has a one-way loop. Trains serve every station on each line except when these are closed for renovations.\nOpening hours.\nThe first train leaves each terminus at 5:30\u00a0a.m. On some lines additional trains start from an intermediate station. The last train, often called the \"balai\" (broom) because it sweeps up remaining passengers, arrives at the terminus at 1:15\u00a0a.m., except on Fridays (since 7 December 2007), Saturdays and on nights before a holiday, when the service ends at 2:15\u00a0a.m.\nOn New Year's Eve, \"F\u00eate de la Musique\", \"Nuit Blanche\" and other events, some stations on Lines 1, 4, 6, 9 and 14 remain open all night.\nTickets.\nTickets are sold online (e.g. via SNCF Connect), at staffed counters and at automated machines in the station foyer. Unlimited passes for a whole day, week or month are called Forfait Navigo. Online, the ticket can directly be added to the phone which can than be used at the automated gates by simply holding the phone onto them. These are located at all entries and exits. Exit from all stations is clearly marked as to the point beyond which possession of a ticket is no longer required.\nFacilities.\nOn 26 June 2012, it was announced that the M\u00e9tro would get Wi-Fi in most stations. Access provided would be free, with a premium paid alternative offer proposed for a faster internet connection. As of 2020, the entire RATP network was connected with 4G service, including within tunnels. The automated Line 1, Line 4 and Line 14 \u2013 as well as some congested stations on Line 13 \u2013 have platform edge doors (\"portes pali\u00e8res\") separating the tracks from the platform.\nAccessibility.\nLargely because most of its stations were built well before accessibility became a consideration, less than 10 per cent of Paris's metro system is wheelchair accessible ranking it as worst metro system in the world for accessibility. The 20 stations of Line 14 (which first opened in 1998) are fully accessible, and all line extensions since 1992 have included lifts at the new stations. From 2022 to 2025, 23 new stations on the M\u00e9tro will be accessible, following extensions to existing lines. The four new lines of the Grand Paris Express, which are expected to start opening in 2026, will also be fully accessible.\nThe Law on Equal Rights and Opportunities, Participation and Citizenship of Persons with Disabilities of 2005 does not require the M\u00e9tro to be made accessible. RATP estimates that retrofitting the network would cost between 4 and 6 billion euros, leaving aside a number of stations it considers impossible to retrofit. As of 2022[ [update]], there were no plans to retrofit existing stations with lifts. RATP notes that buses and trams in Paris are fully accessible, and many RER &amp; Transilien stations are accessible.\nTechnical specifications.\nThe M\u00e9tro has of track and 321 stations, 61 connecting between lines. These figures do not include the RER network. The average distance between stations is . Trains stop at all stations, except when they are closed. Lines do not share tracks, including at transfer stations, where different platforms are used for different lines.\nAs of 2018, trains had a maximum permitted speed of and their commercial speed averaged at peak times. The fastest lines were the automated ones: Line 14, which averaged , and Line 1, which averaged . Trains travel on the right. The track is standard gauge but the loading gauge is smaller than the mainline SNCF network. Power is from a lateral third rail, 750 V DC, except on the rubber-tyred lines where the current is from guide bars.\nThe loading gauge is small compared to those of newer metro systems (but comparable to that of early European metros), with capacities of between about 560 and 720 passengers per train on Lines 1\u201314. Many other metro systems (such as those of New York and London) adopted expanded tunnel dimensions for their newer lines (or used tunnels of multiple sizes almost from the outset, in the case of Boston), at the cost of operating incompatible fleets of rolling stock. Paris built all lines to the same dimensions as its original lines. Before the introduction of rubber-tire lines in the 1950s, this common shared size theoretically allowed any M\u00e9tro rolling stock to operate on any line, but in practice each line was assigned a regular roster of trains.\nA feature is the use of rubber-tired trains on five lines: this technique was developed by RATP and entered service in 1951. The technology was exported to many networks around the world (including Montreal, Mexico City and Santiago). Lines 1, 4, 6, 11 and 14 have special adaptations to accommodate rubber-tyred trains. Trains are composed of 3 to 8 cars depending on the line, the most common being 5 cars, but all trains on the same line have the same number of cars.\nThe M\u00e9tro is designed to provide local, point-to-point service in Paris proper and service into the city from some close suburbs. Stations within Paris are very close together to form a grid structure, ensuring that every point in the city is close to a M\u00e9tro station (less than ), at the cost of speed, except on Line 14 where the stations are farther apart and the trains travel faster. The system is complemented by the RER, which extends farther out into the suburbs and functions as an express network for the city and its surroundings.\nThe Paris M\u00e9tro runs mostly underground; surface sections include sections on viaducts in Paris (Lines 1, 2, 5, and 6) and at the surface in the suburbs (Lines 1, 5, 8, and 13). In most cases, both tracks are laid in a single tunnel. Almost all lines follow roads, having been built by the cut-and-cover method near the surface (the earliest by hand). Line 1 follows the straight course of the Champs-Elys\u00e9es and on other lines, some stations (Li\u00e8ge, Commerce) have platforms that do not align: the street above is too narrow to fit both platforms opposite each other. Many lines have very sharp curves. The specifications established in 1900 required a very low minimum curve radius by railway standards, but even this was often not fully respected, for example near Bastille and Notre Dame de Lorette. Parts of the network are built at depth, in particular a section of Line 12 under Montmartre, the sections under the Seine, and all of Line 14.\nLines 7 and 13 have two terminal branches, while line 7bis runs in a unidirectional loop at one end. One end of lines 2 and 5 each and both ends of line 6 have their terminus station on a balloon loop. One end of lines 3bis and 7bis each have their trains essentially operate this way, but instead reverse. One end of lines 2, 3bis, and 4 have trains run out of service on a balloon loop before reentering service. All other termini have trains continue a certain distance beyond the terminal, before proceeding back to the station on a different platform headed the other way.\nRolling stock.\nThe rolling stock has steel wheels (\"MF\" for \"mat\u00e9riel fer\") and rubber-tyred trains (\"MP\" for \"mat\u00e9riel pneu\"). The different versions of each kind are specified by year of design. Some trains have suffixes to differentiate between them \u2013 \"CC\" (\"Conduite\" \"Conducteur\") for trains driven by a driver and \"CA\" (\"Conduite Automatique)\" for trains that are automatically driven.\nStations.\nThe typical station comprises two central tracks flanked by two four-metre wide platforms. About 50 stations, generally current or former termini, are exceptions; most have three tracks and two platforms (Porte d'Orl\u00e9ans), or two tracks and a central platform (Porte Dauphine). Some stations are single-track, either due to difficult terrain (Saint-Georges), a narrow street above (Li\u00e8ge) or track loops (\u00c9glise d'Auteuil).\nStation length was originally , enough to accommodate the 5-car trains used on most lines. This was extended to on high-traffic lines (Line 1 and Line 4) which operate six-car trains, with some stations at for accommodating seven-car trains (the difference as yet unused).\nIn general, stations were built near the surface by the cut-and-cover method, and are vaulted. Stations of the former \"Nord-Sud\" network (Line 12 and Line 13) have higher ceilings, due to the former presence of a ceiling catenary. There are exceptions to the rule of near-surface vaulting:\nSeveral ghost stations are no longer served by trains. One of the three platforms at Porte des Lilas station is on a currently unused section of track, often used as a backdrop in films.\nIn 2018, the busiest stations were Saint-Lazare (46.7 million passengers), Gare du Nord (45.8), Gare de Lyon (36.9), Montparnasse \u2013 Bienven\u00fce (30.6), Gare de l'Est (21.4), Biblioth\u00e8que Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand (18.8), R\u00e9publique (18.3), Les Halles (17.5), La D\u00e9fense (16.0) and Bastille (13.2).\nInterior decoration.\nConcourses are decorated in Art Nouveau style defined at the M\u00e9tro's opening in 1900. The spirit of this aesthetic has generally been respected in renovations.\nStandard vaulted stations are lined by small white earthenware tiles, chosen because of the poor efficiency of early twentieth century electric lighting. From the outset walls have been used for advertising; posters in early stations are framed by coloured tiles with the name of the original operator (CMP or \"Nord Sud\"). Stations of the former \"Nord Sud\" (most of line 12 and parts of line 13) generally have more meticulous decoration. Station names are usually inscribed on metallic plaques in white letters on a blue background or in white tiles on a background of blue tiles.\nThe first renovations took place after the Second World War, when the installation of fluorescent lighting revealed the poor state of the original tiling. Three main styles of redecoration followed in succession.\nA number of stations have original decorations to reflect the cultural significance of their locations. The first to receive this treatment was Louvre\u00a0\u2013 Rivoli on line 1, which contains copies of the masterpieces on display at the museum. Other notable examples include Bastille (line 1), Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s (line 4), Cluny\u00a0\u2013 La Sorbonne (line 10) and Arts et M\u00e9tiers (line 11).\nExterior decoration.\nThe original Art Nouveau entrances are iconic symbols of Paris. There are 83 of them. Designed by Hector Guimard in a style that caused some surprise and controversy in 1900, there are two main variants:\nLater stations and redecorations have brought increasingly simple styles to entrances.\nA handful of entrances have original architecture (Saint-Lazare); a number are integrated into residential or standalone buildings (Pelleport).\nFuture.\nPlanned.\nThe original Grand Paris Express plans had a total span of and counted 68 stations, the completion of which forms the major part of the currently planned lines.\nProposed.\nIn addition to the projects already under construction or currently being actively studied, there have also been proposals for:\nCultural significance.\nThe M\u00e9tro has a cultural significance in the arts that goes well beyond Paris. The term \"metro\" has become a generic name for subways and urban underground railways.\nThe station entrance kiosks, designed by Hector Guimard, fostered Art Nouveau building style (once widely known as \"le style M\u00e9tro\"); however, some French commentators criticised the Guimard station kiosks, including their green colour and sign lettering, as difficult to read.\nThe success of rubber-tired lines led to their export to metro systems around the world, starting with the Montreal Metro. The success of Montreal \"did much to accelerate the international subway boom\" of the 1960s/1970s and \"assure the preeminence of the French in the process\". Rubber-tired systems were adopted in Mexico City, Santiago, Lausanne, Turin, Singapore and other cities. The Japanese adopted rubber-tired metros (with their own technology and manufacturing firms) to systems in Kobe, Sapporo, as well as parts of Tokyo.\nThe \"Rabbit of the Paris M\u00e9tro\" is an anthropomorphic rabbit visible on stickers on the doors of the trains since 1977 to advise passengers (especially children) of the risk of getting one's hands trapped when the doors are opening, as well as the risk of injury on escalators or becoming trapped in the closing doors. This rabbit is now a popular icon in Paris similar to the \"mind the gap\" phrase in London.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Nicknamed \"the Brazilian Bombshell\", she was known for her signature fruit hat outfits that she wore in her American films.\nAs a young woman, Miranda designed clothes and hats in a boutique before making her debut as a singer, recording with composer Josu\u00e9 de Barros in 1929. Miranda's 1930 recording of \"Ta\u00ed (Pra Voc\u00ea Gostar de Mim)\", written by Joubert de Carvalho, catapulted her to stardom in Brazil as the foremost interpreter of samba.\nDuring the 1930s, Miranda performed on Brazilian radio and appeared in five Brazilian \"chanchadas\", films celebrating Brazilian music, dance and the country's carnival culture. \"Hello, Hello Brazil!\" and \"Hello, Hello, Carnival!\" embodied the spirit of these early Miranda films. The 1939 musical \"Banana da Terra\" (directed by Ruy Costa) gave the world her \"Baiana\" image, inspired by Afro-Brazilians from the north-eastern state of Bahia.\nIn 1939, Broadway producer Lee Shubert, after seeing Miranda perform at Cassino da Urca in Rio de Janeiro, offered her an eight-week contract to perform in \"The Streets of Paris\". The following year she made her first Hollywood film, \"Down Argentine Way\", co-starring Don Ameche and Betty Grable, and her exotic clothing and Brazilian Portuguese accent became her trademark. That year, she was voted the third-most-popular personality in the United States; she and her group, Bando da Lua, were invited to sing and dance for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1941, she was the first Latin American star to be invited to leave her handprints and footprints in the courtyard of Grauman's Chinese Theatre and was the first South American honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1943, Miranda starred in Busby Berkeley's \"The Gang's All Here\", which featured musical numbers with the fruit hats that became her trademark. By 1945, she was the highest-paid woman in the United States.\nMiranda made 14 Hollywood films between 1940 and 1953. Although she was hailed as a talented performer, her popularity waned by the end of World War II. Miranda came to resent the stereotypical \"Brazilian Bombshell\" image she had cultivated and attempted to free herself of it with limited success. She focused on nightclub appearances and became a fixture on television variety shows. Despite being stereotyped, Miranda's performances popularized Brazilian music and increased public awareness of Latin culture. Miranda is considered the precursor of Brazil's 1960s Tropicalismo cultural movement. A museum was built in Rio de Janeiro in her honor and she was the subject of the documentary \"\" (1995).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life.\nMiranda was born Maria do Carmo Miranda da Cunha in 1909 in V\u00e1rzea da Ovelha e Aliviada, a village in the northern Portuguese municipality of Marco de Canaveses. She was the second daughter of Jos\u00e9 Maria Pinto da Cunha (17 February 1887\u00a0\u2013 21 June 1938) and Maria Em\u00edlia Miranda (10 March 1886, Rio de Janeiro \u2013 9 November 1971).\nThe family's emigration to Brazil was already scheduled; however, upon finding herself pregnant, Carmen Miranda's mother preferred to wait for her daughter's birth. In 1909, her father emigrated to Brazil and settled in Rio de Janeiro, where he opened a barber shop. Her mother followed in 1910 with their daughters, Olinda (1907\u20131931) and Carmen, who was less than a year old. Although Carmen never returned to Portugal, she retained her Portuguese nationality. In Brazil, her parents had four more children: Amaro (1912\u20131988), Cecilia (1913\u20132011), Aurora (1915\u20132005) and \u00d3scar (1916\u20131998).\nShe was christened Carmen by her father because of his love for Bizet's \"Carmen\". This passion for opera influenced his children, and Miranda's love for singing and dancing, at an early age. She was educated at the Convent of Saint Therese of Lisieux. Her father did not approve of Miranda's plans to enter show business; her mother supported her, despite being beaten when her father discovered that his daughter had auditioned for a radio show (she had sung at parties and festivals in Rio). Miranda's older sister, Olinda, developed tuberculosis and was sent to Portugal for treatment; the singer worked in a tie shop at age 14 to help pay her sister's medical bills. She then worked in a boutique (where she learned to make hats) and opened a successful hat business.\nCareer.\nIn Brazil.\nMiranda was introduced to Josu\u00e9 de Barros, a composer and musician from Bahia, while she was working at her family's inn. With help from de Barros and Brunswick Records, she recorded her first single (the samba \"N\u00e3o v\u00e1 Simbora\") in 1929. Miranda's second single, \"Pr\u00e1 Voc\u00ea Gostar de Mim\" (also known as \"Ta\u00ed\", and released in 1930), was a collaboration with Brazilian composer Joubert de Carvalho and sold a record 35,000 copies that year. She signed a two-year contract with RCA Victor in 1930, giving them exclusive rights to her image.\nIn 1933, Miranda signed a two-year contract with R\u00e1dio Mayrink Veiga, the most popular Brazilian station of the 1930s, and was the first contract singer in Brazilian radio history; for a year, in 1937, she moved to R\u00e1dio Tupi. She later signed a contract with Odeon Records, making her the highest-paid radio singer in Brazil at the time.\nMiranda's rise to stardom in Brazil was linked to the growth of a native style of music: the samba. The samba and Miranda's emerging career enhanced the revival of Brazilian nationalism during the government of President Get\u00falio Vargas. Her gracefulness and vitality in her recordings and live performances gave her the nickname \"Cantora do It\". The singer was later known as \"Ditadora Risonha do Samba\", and in 1933 radio announcer Cesar Ladeira christened her \"A Pequena Not\u00e1vel\".\nHer Brazilian film career was linked to a genre of musical films that drew on the nation's carnival traditions and the annual celebration and musical style of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's capital at the time. Miranda performed a musical number in \"O Carnaval Cantado no Rio\" (1932, the first sound documentary on the subject) and three songs in \"A Voz do Carnaval\" (1933), which combined footage of street celebrations in Rio with a fictitious plot providing a pretext for musical numbers.\nMiranda's next screen performance was in the musical \"Hello, Hello Brazil!\" (1935), in which she performed its closing number: the \"marcha\" \"Primavera no Rio\", which she had recorded for Victor in August 1934. Several months after the film's release, according to \"Cinearte\" magazine, \"Carmen Miranda is currently the most popular figure in Brazilian cinema, judging by the sizeable correspondence that she receives\". In her next film, \"Estudantes\" (1935), she had a speaking part for the first time. Miranda played Mimi, a young radio singer (who performs two numbers in the film) who falls in love with a university student (played by singer M\u00e1rio Reis).\nShe starred in the next co-production from the Waldow and Cin\u00e9dia studios, the musical \"Hello, Hello, Carnival!\" (1936), which contained a roll call of popular music and radio performers (including Miranda's sister, Aurora). A standard backstage plot permitted 23 musical numbers and, by contemporary Brazilian standards, the film was a major production. Its set reproduced the interior of Rio's plush Atl\u00e2ntico casino (where some scenes were filmed) and was a backdrop for some of its musical numbers. Miranda's stardom is evident in a film poster with a full-length photograph of her and her name topping the cast list.\nAlthough she became synonymous with colorful fruit hats during her later career, she began wearing them only in 1939, and contrary to popular belief, they were never made from real fruit. Miranda appeared in the film \"Banana da Terra\" that year in a glamorous version of the traditional dress of a poor black girl in Bahia: a flowing dress and a fruit-hat turban. She sang \"O Que \u00c9 Que A Baiana Tem?\"; which intended to empower a social class that was usually disparaged.\nProducer Lee Shubert offered Miranda an eight-week contract to perform in \"The Streets of Paris\" on Broadway after seeing her perform in 1939 at Rio's Cassino da Urca. Although she was interested in performing in New York, she refused to accept the deal unless Shubert agreed to also hire her band, the Bando da Lua. He refused, saying that there were many capable musicians in New York who could back her. Miranda remained steadfast, feeling that North American musicians would not be able to authenticate the sounds of Brazil. Shubert compromised, agreeing to hire the six band members but not paying for their transport to New York. President Get\u00falio Vargas, recognizing the value to Brazil of Miranda's tour, announced that the Brazilian government would pay for the band's transportation on the Moore-McCormack Lines between Rio and New York. Vargas believed that Miranda would foster ties between the northern and southern hemispheres and act as a goodwill ambassador in the United States, increasing Brazil's share of the American coffee market. Miranda took the official sanction of her trip and her duty to represent Brazil to the outside world seriously. She left for New York on the SS \"Uruguay\" on 4 May 1939, a few months before World War II.\nIn the U.S..\nMiranda arrived in New York on 18 May 1939. She and the band had their first Broadway performance on 19 June 1939 in \"The Streets of Paris\". Although Miranda's part was small (she spoke only four words), she received good reviews and became a media sensation. According to \"New York Times\" theater critic Brooks Atkinson, most of the musical numbers \"ap[e] the tawdry dullness\" of genuine Paris revues and \"the chorus girls, skin-deep in atmosphere, strike what Broadway thinks a Paris pose ought to be\". Atkinson added, however, that \"South American contributes the [revue's] most magnetic personality\" (Miranda). Singing \"rapid-rhythmed songs to the accompaniment of a Brazilian band, she radiates heat that will tax the Broadhurst [theater] air-conditioning plant this Summer\". Although Atkinson gave the revue a lukewarm review, he wrote that Miranda made the show.\nSyndicated columnist Walter Winchell wrote for the \"New York Daily Mirror\" that a star had been born who would save Broadway from the slump in ticket sales caused by the 1939 New York World's Fair. Winchell's praise of Carmen and her Bando da Lua was repeated on his Blue Network radio show, which reached 55 million listeners daily. The press called Miranda \"the girl who saved Broadway from the World's Fair\". \nAccording to a \"Life\" magazine reviewer:\nPartly because their unusual melody and heavy accented rhythms are unlike anything ever heard in a Manhattan revue before, partly because there is not a clue to their meaning except the gay rolling of Carmen Miranda's insinuating eyes, these songs, and Miranda herself, are the outstanding hit of the show.\nWhen news of Broadway's latest star (known as the Brazilian Bombshell) reached Hollywood, Twentieth Century-Fox began to develop a film featuring Miranda. Its working title was \"The South American Way\" (the title of a song she had performed in New York), and the film was later entitled \"Down Argentine Way\" (1940). Although its production and cast were based in Los Angeles, Miranda's scenes were filmed in New York because of her club obligations. Fox could combine the footage from both cities because the singer had no dialogue with the other cast members. \"Down Argentine Way\" was successful, grossing $2 million that year at the US box office.\nThe Shuberts brought Miranda back to Broadway, teaming her with Olsen and Johnson, Ella Logan, and the Blackburn Twins in the musical revue \"Sons o' Fun\" on 1 December 1941. The show was a hodgepodge of slapstick, songs, and skits; according to \"New York Herald Tribune\" theater critic Richard Watts Jr., \"In her eccentric and highly personalized fashion, Miss Miranda is by way of being an artist and her numbers give the show its one touch of distinction.\" On 1 June 1942, she left the production when her Shubert contract expired; meanwhile, she recorded for Decca Records.\nMiranda was encouraged by the US government as part of Roosevelt's Good Neighbor policy, designed to strengthen ties with Latin America. It was believed that performers like her would give the policy a favorable impression with the American public. Miranda's contract with 20th Century Fox lasted from 1941 to 1946, coinciding with the creation and activities of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. The goal of the OCIAA was to obtain support from Latin American society and its governments for the United States.\nThe Good Neighbor policy had been linked to American interference in Latin America; Roosevelt sought better diplomatic relations with Brazil and other South American nations and pledged to refrain from military intervention (which had occurred to protect American business interests in industries such as mining or agriculture). Hollywood was asked to help, and Walt Disney Studios and 20th Century Fox participated. Miranda was considered a goodwill ambassador and a promoter of intercontinental culture.\nBrazilian criticism.\nAlthough Miranda's American popularity continued to increase, she began to lose favor with some Brazilians. On 10 July 1940, she returned to Brazil and was welcomed by cheering fans. Soon after her arrival, however, the Brazilian press began criticizing Miranda for accommodating American commercialism and projecting a negative image of Brazil. Members of the upper class felt that her image was \"too black\", and she was criticized in a Brazilian newspaper for \"singing bad-taste black sambas\". Other Brazilians criticized Miranda for playing a stereotypical \"Latina bimbo\". In her first interview after her arrival in the US in the \"New York World-Telegram\", she played up her then-limited knowledge of the English language: \"I say money, money, money. I say twenty words in English. I say money, money, money and I say hot dog!\"\nOn 15 July, Miranda appeared in a charity concert organized by Brazilian First Lady Darci Vargas and attended by members of Brazil's high society. She greeted the audience in English and was met with silence. When Miranda began singing \"The South American Way\", a song from one of her club acts, the audience began to boo her. Although she tried to finish her act, she gave up and left the stage when the audience refused to let up. The incident deeply hurt Miranda, who wept in her dressing room. The following day, the Brazilian press criticized her as \"too Americanized\".\nWeeks later, Miranda responded to the criticism with the Portuguese song \"Disseram que Voltei Americanizada\" (\"They Say I've Come Back Americanized\"). Another song, \"Bananas Is My Business\", was based on a line from one of her films and directly addressed her image. Upset by the criticism, Miranda did not return to Brazil for 14 years.\nHer films were scrutinized by Latin American audiences for characterizing Central and South America in a culturally homogeneous way. When Miranda's films reached Central and South American theaters, they were perceived as depicting Latin American cultures through the lens of American preconceptions. Some Latin Americans felt that their cultures were misrepresented, and felt that someone from their own region was misrepresenting them. \"Down Argentine Way\" was criticized, with Argentines saying that it failed to depict Argentine culture. Its lyrics were allegedly replete with non-Argentine themes, and its sets were a fusion of Mexican, Cuban, and Brazilian culture. The film was later banned in Argentina for \"wrongfully portraying life in Buenos Aires\". Similar sentiments were voiced in Cuba after the debut of Miranda's \"Weekend in Havana\" (1941), with Cuban audiences offended by Miranda's portrayal of a Cuban woman. Her performances were arguably hybrids of Brazilian and other Latin cultures. Critics said that Miranda's other films misrepresented Latin locales, assuming that Brazilian culture was a representation of Latin America.\nPeak years.\nDuring the war years, Miranda starred in eight of her 14 films; although the studios called her the Brazilian Bombshell, the films blurred her Brazilian identity in favor of a Latin American image. According to a \"Variety\" review of director Irving Cummings' \"That Night in Rio\" (1941, Miranda's second Hollywood film), her character upstaged the leads: \"[Don] Ameche is very capable in a dual role, and Miss [Alice] Faye is eye-appealing but it's the tempestuous Miranda who really gets away to a flying start from the first sequence\". \"The New York Times\" article said, \"Whenever one or the other Ameche character gets out of the way and lets [Miranda] have the screen, the film sizzles and scorches wickedly.\" Years later, Clive Hirschhorn wrote: \"\"That Night in Rio\" was the quintessential Fox war-time musical \u2013 an over-blown, over-dressed, over-produced and thoroughly irresistible cornucopia of escapist ingredients.\" On 24 March 1941, Miranda was one of the first Latinas to imprint her handprints and footprints on the sidewalk of Grauman's Chinese Theatre.\nHer next film, \"Week-End in Havana\", was directed by Walter Lang and produced by William LeBaron. The cast included Alice Faye, John Payne, and Cesar Romero. After the studio's third effort to activate the \"Latin hot blood\", Fox was called \"Hollywood's best good neighbor\" by Bosley Crowther. During the week it was released, the film topped the box office (surpassing \"Citizen Kane\", released a week earlier).\nIn 1942, 20th Century-Fox paid $60,000 to Lee Shubert to terminate his contract with Miranda, who finished her \"Sons o' Fun\" tour and began filming \"Springtime in the Rockies\". The film, which grossed about $2 million, was one of the year's ten most-successful films at the box office. According to a \"Chicago Tribune\" review, it was \"senseless, but eye intriguing\u00a0... The basic plot is splashed over with songs and dances and the mouthings and eye and hand work of Carmen Miranda, who sure would be up a tree if she ever had to sing in the dark\".\nIn 1943, she appeared in Busby Berkeley's \"The Gang's All Here\". Berkeley's musicals were known for lavish production, and Miranda's role as Dorita featured \"The Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat\". A special effect made her fruit-bedecked hat appear larger than possible. By then she was typecast as an exotic singer, and under her studio contract she was obligated to make public appearances in her ever-more-outlandish film costumes. One of her records, \"I Make My Money With Bananas\" seemed to pay ironic tribute to her typecasting. \"The Gang's All Here\" was one of 1943's 10 highest-grossing films and Fox's most expensive production of the year. It received positive reviews, although \"The New York Times\" film critic wrote: \"Mr. Berkeley has some sly notions under his busby. One or two of his dance spectacles seem to stem straight from Freud.\"\nThe following year Miranda made a cameo appearance in \"Four Jills in a Jeep\", a film based on a true adventure of actresses Kay Francis, Carole Landis, Martha Raye, and Mitzi Mayfair; Alice Faye and Betty Grable also made brief appearances. In 1944 Miranda also starred with Don Ameche in \"Greenwich Village\", a Fox musical with William Bendix and Vivian Blaine in supporting roles. The film was poorly received; according to \"The New York Times\", \"Technicolor is the picture's chief asset, but still worth a look for the presence of Carmen Miranda\". In her \"Miami News\" review, Peggy Simmonds wrote: \"Fortunately for \"Greenwich Village\", the picture is made in Technicolor and has Carmen Miranda. Unfortunately for Carmen Miranda, the production doesn't do her justice, the overall effect is disappointing, but still she sparkles the picture whenever she appears.\" \"Greenwich Village\" was less successful at the box office than Fox and Miranda had expected.\nMiranda's third 1944 film was \"Something for the Boys\", a musical comedy based on the Broadway musical with songs by Cole Porter and starring Ethel Merman. It was Miranda's first film without William LeBaron or Darryl F. Zanuck as producer. The producer was Irving Starr, who oversaw the studio's second-string films. According to \"Time\" magazine, the film \"turns out to have nothing very notable for anyone\".\nBy 1945, Miranda was Hollywood's highest-paid entertainer and the top female taxpayer in the United States, earning more than $200,000 that year ($2.88 million in 2020, adjusted for inflation).\nDecline.\nAfter World War II, Miranda's films at Fox were produced in black-and-white, indicative of Hollywood's diminishing interest in her and Latin Americans in general. A monochrome Carmen Miranda reduced the box-office appeal of the backstage musical, \"Doll Face\" (1945), in which she was fourth on the bill. Miranda played Chita Chula, billed in the show-within-the-film as \"the little lady from Brazil\"\u2014a cheerful comic sidekick to leading lady Doll Face (Vivian Blaine) with one musical number and little dialogue. A \"New York Herald Tribune\" review read, \"Carmen Miranda does what she always does, only not well\"; according to \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", \"Carmen Miranda appears in a straight part with only one singing number. The innovation is not a success, but the fault is the director's not Carmen's.\"\nIn \"If I'm Lucky\" (1946), her follow-up film for Fox when she was no longer under contract, Miranda was again fourth on the bill with her stock screen persona firmly in evidence: heavily accented English, comic malapropisms, and bizarre hairstyles recreating her famous turbans. When Miranda's contract with Fox expired on 1 January 1946, she decided to pursue an acting career free of studio constraints. Miranda's ambition was to play a lead role showcasing her comic skills, which she set out to do in \"Copacabana\" (1947, an independent production released by United Artists starring Groucho Marx). Although her films were modest hits, critics and the American public did not accept her new image.\nAlthough Miranda's film career was faltering, her musical career remained solid and she was still a popular nightclub attraction. From 1948 to 1950, she joined the Andrews Sisters in producing and recording three Decca singles. Their first collaboration was on radio in 1945, when Miranda appeared on ABC's \"The Andrews Sisters Show\". Their first single, \"Cuanto La Gusta\", was the most popular and reached number twelve on the \"Billboard\" chart. \"The Wedding Samba\", which reached number 23, followed in 1950.\nAfter \"Copacabana\", Joe Pasternak invited Miranda to make two Technicolor musicals for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer: \"A Date with Judy\" (1948) and \"Nancy Goes to Rio\" (1950). In the first production MGM wanted to portray a different image, allowing her to remove her turban and reveal her own hair (styled by Sydney Guilaroff) and makeup (by Jack Dawn). Miranda's wardrobe for the film substituted elegant dresses and hats designed by Helen Rose for \"baiana\" outfits. She was again fourth on the bill as Rosita Cochellas, a rumba teacher who first appears about 40 minutes into the film and has little dialogue. Despite MGM's efforts to change Miranda's persona, her roles in both productions were peripheral, watered-down caricatures relying on fractured English and over-the-top musical and dance numbers.\nIn her final film, \"Scared Stiff\" (1953, a black-and-white Paramount production with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis), Miranda's appeal was again muted. Returning full-circle to her first Hollywood film, \"Down Argentine Way\", she had virtually no narrative function. Lewis parodies her, miming badly to \"Mam\u00e3e eu quero\" (which is playing on a scratched record) and eating a banana he plucks from his turban. Miranda played Carmelita Castilha, a Brazilian showgirl on a cruise ship, with her costumes and performances bordering on self-parody.\nIn April 1953, she began a four-month European tour. While performing in Cincinnati in October, Miranda collapsed from exhaustion; she was rushed to LeRoy Sanitarium by her husband, Dave Sebastian, and canceled four following performances.\nPersonal life.\nDesiring creative freedom, Miranda decided to produce her own film in 1947 and played opposite Groucho Marx in \"Copacabana\". The film's budget was divided into about ten investors' shares. A Texan investor who owned one of the shares sent his brother, David Sebastian (23 November 1907\u00a0\u2013 11 September 1990), to keep an eye on Miranda and his interests on the set. Sebastian befriended her, and they began dating.\nMiranda and Sebastian married on 17 March 1947 at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills, with Patrick J. Concannon officiating. In 1948, Miranda became pregnant, but miscarried after a show. Although the marriage was brief, Miranda (who was Catholic) did not want a divorce. Her sister, Aurora, said in the documentary \"\": \"He married her for selfish reasons; she got very sick after she married and lived with a lot of depression\". The couple announced their separation in September 1949, but reconciled several months later.\nMiranda was discreet, and little is known about her private life. Before she left for the US, she had relationships with Mario Cunha, Carlos da Rocha Faria (son of a traditional family in Rio de Janeiro) and Alo\u00edsio de Oliveira, a member of the Bando da Lua. In the US, Miranda maintained relationships with John Payne, Arturo de C\u00f3rdova, Dana Andrews, Harold Young, John Wayne, Donald Buka and Carlos Niemeyer. During her later years, in addition to heavy smoking and alcohol consumption, she began taking amphetamines and barbiturates, all of which took a toll on her health.\nDeath.\n Miranda performed at the New Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas in April 1955, and in Cuba three months later before returning to Los Angeles to recuperate from a recurrent bronchial ailment. On 4 August, she was filming a segment for the NBC variety series \"The Jimmy Durante Show\". According to Durante, Miranda had complained of feeling unwell before filming; he offered to find her a replacement, but she declined. After completing \"Jackson, Miranda, and Gomez\", a song-and-dance number with Durante, she fell to one knee. Durante later said, \"I thought she had slipped. She got up and said she was outta breath. I told her I'll take her lines. But she goes ahead with 'em. We finished work about 11 o'clock and she seemed happy.\"\nAfter the last take, Miranda and Durante gave an impromptu performance on the set for the cast and technicians. The singer took several cast members and some friends home with her for a small party. She went upstairs to bed at about 3 a.m. Miranda undressed, placed her platform shoes in a corner, lit a cigarette, placed it in an ashtray and went into her bathroom to remove her makeup. She apparently came from the bathroom with a small, round mirror in her hand; in the small hall that led to her bedroom, she collapsed from a fatal heart attack. Miranda was 46 years old. Her body was found at about 10:30\u00a0a.m. lying in the hallway. The \"Jimmy Durante Show\" episode in which Miranda appeared was aired two months after her death, on 15 October 1955. The episode began with Durante paying tribute to the singer, while also indicating that her family had given permission for the performance to be broadcast. A clip of the episode was included in the A&amp;E Network's \"Biography\" episode about the singer.\nIn accordance with her wishes, Miranda's body, dressed in a red suit, was flown back to Rio de Janeiro. The casket was draped with the flag of Brazil; the Brazilian government declared a period of national mourning.\nAbout 60,000 people attended her memorial service at the Rio de Janeiro town hall, and more than half a million Brazilians escorted her funeral cort\u00e8ge to the cemetery.\nMiranda is buried in S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Batista Cemetery in Rio de Janeiro. In 1956, her belongings were donated by her husband and family to the Carmen Miranda Museum, which opened in Rio on 5 August 1976. For her contributions to the entertainment industry, Miranda has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at the south side of the 6262 block of Hollywood Boulevard.\nImage.\nMiranda's Hollywood image was that of a generic Latina, blurring distinctions between Brazil, Portugal, Argentina, and Mexico and samba, tango and habanera music. It was stylized and flamboyant; she often wore platform sandals and towering headdresses made of fruit, becoming known as \"the lady in the tutti-frutti hat\". Her enormous, fruit-laden hats were iconic visuals recognized worldwide; Saks Fifth Avenue developed a line of Miranda-inspired turbans and jewelry in 1939, and Bonwit Teller created mannequins resembling the singer.\nHer tutti-frutti hat from \"The Gang's All Here\" (1943) inspired the United Fruit Company's Chiquita Banana logo the following year. During the 1960s, \"tropic\u00e1lia\" filmmakers in Brazil were influenced by Miranda's Hollywood films.\nIn 2009 she was the subject of S\u00e3o Paulo Fashion Week and a short film, \"Tutti Frutti\", by German photographer Ellen von Unwerth. Two years later, Macy's wanted to use Miranda to promote a clothing line. Other products influenced by her stardom are the Brazilian fashion brand Malwee's \"Chica Boom Chic\" collection for women, and the Chica Boom Brasil company's high-end Carmen Miranda line, which includes Miranda-themed bags, wall clocks, crockery and placemats.\nLegacy.\nAccording to Brazilian musician Caetano Veloso, \"Miranda was first a cause of both pride and shame, and later, a symbol that inspired the merciless gaze we began to cast upon ourselves ... Carmen conquered 'White' America as no other South American has done or ever would, in an era when it was enough to be 'recognizably Latin and Negroid' in style and aesthetics to attract attention.\" \nMiranda was the first Brazilian artist to gain worldwide fame in the 1950s, and she continued to define South American music in North America for decades. In 1991, Veloso wrote that \"today, anything associated with Brazilian music in America \u2013 or with any music from the Southern Hemisphere in the Northern \u2013 makes us think of Carmen Miranda. And to think of her is to think about the complexity of this relationship.\"\nAlthough she was more popular abroad than in Brazil at the time of her death, Miranda contributed significantly to Brazilian music and culture. She was accused of commercializing Brazilian music and dance, but she can be credited with bringing the country's national music (samba) to a global audience. She introduced the baiana\u2014a traditional style of dress from Bahia, with wide skirts and turbans\u2014as a Brazilian showgirl look, both at home and abroad. The \"baiana\" became a central feature of Carnival for both women and men.\nSince her death, Miranda has been remembered as an important Brazilian artist and one of the most influential figures in Hollywood. She was one of 500 stars nominated for the American Film Institute's 50 greatest screen legends.\nOn September 25, 1998, a square in Hollywood was named Carmen Miranda Square during a ceremony led by Hollywood\u2019s honorary mayor, Johnny Grant (a friend of Miranda\u2019s since World War II), and attended by Brazilian Consul General Jori\u00f3 Gama, along with members of Bando da Lua, who had accompanied Miranda in her performances. The square is located at the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Orange Drive, across from Grauman's Chinese Theatre\u2014near the spot where Miranda gave an impromptu performance on V-J Day.\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary of Miranda's death, a Carmen Miranda Forever exhibit was displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in Rio de Janeiro in November 2005 and at the Latin America Memorial in S\u00e3o Paulo the following year. In 2005, Ruy Castro published \"Carmen \u2013 Uma Biografia\", a 600-page biography of \"the most famous Brazilian woman of the 20th century.\" Brazilians \"tend to forget,\" Castro told Mac Margolis of \"Newsweek\", that \"no Brazilian woman has ever been as popular as Carmen Miranda \u2013 in Brazil or anywhere.\"\nDorival Caymmi's \"O Que \u00c9 Que a Baiana Tem?\" was his first work to be recorded, and it introduced both the samba rhythm and Miranda to the United States in 1939. It was inducted into the Latin category of the 2008 National Recording Registry list.\nMiranda, along with Selena, Celia Cruz, Carlos Gardel, and Tito Puente, appeared on a set of commemorative U.S. Postal Service Latin Music Legends stamps, painted by Rafael Lopez, in 2011. Marie Therese Dominguez, vice president of government relations and public policy for the postal service, said:\n\"From this day forward, these colorful, vibrant images of our Latin music legends will travel on letters and packages to every single household in America. In this small way, we have created a lasting tribute to five extraordinary performers, and we are proud and honored to share their legacy with Americans everywhere through these beautiful stamps.\"\n\"Down Argentine Way\" and \"The Gang's All Here\" were added to the National Film Registry in 2014. The closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics included a tribute to Miranda before the athletes' parade, with Roberta S\u00e1 portraying the singer. On February 9, 2017, Miranda was honored with a Google Doodle created by artist Sophie Diao to commemorate the 108th anniversary of her birth.\nIn popular culture.\nIn \"The House Across the Bay\" (1940, produced by Walter Wanger and released by United Artists), Joan Bennett performed the Mirandaesque \"Chula Chihuahua\". \"Babes on Broadway\"'s (1941) finale opens with \"Bombshell from Brazil\", where Mickey Rooney (dressed as Miranda) sings \"Mam\u00e3e Eu Quero\". The finale of \"Time Out for Rhythm\" (1941) begins with the Three Stooges performing a rumba number; Curly Howard is dressed as Carmen Miranda. In 1943's \"Yankee Doodle Daffy\", Daffy Duck performs \"Chica Chica Boom Chic\" while dressed as Carmen Miranda. The United Fruit Company created a banana-woman character in 1944, Chiquita, whose fruit hat resembled Miranda's. In \"Small Town Deb\" (1942), Jane Withers does an impression of Carmen Miranda and sings \"I, Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi (I Like You Very Much)\", which was one of Miranda's signature songs. In the British comedy, \"Fiddlers Three\", Tommy Trinder gives a bizarre performance as \"Senorita Alvarez\" from Brazil, a bold impersonation of Miranda.\nThe song \"Mam\u00e3e eu quero\" was featured in the 1943 \"Tom and Jerry\" short \"Baby Puss\", as performed by a trio of cartoon cats (Butch, Topsy and Meathead) with Topsy dressed up with a fruit hat, impersonating Carmen Miranda.\nIn \"Winged Victory\" (1944) Sascha Brastoff impersonates Carmen Miranda. In \"Mildred Pierce\", Jo Ann Marlowe sings a Mirandaesque \"South American Way\". In \"Be a Pal\", a season-one episode of \"I Love Lucy\", Lucille Ball imitates Miranda and lip-syncs to \"Mam\u00e3e Eu Quero\".\nIn \"Diplomatic Courier\" (1952), during a nightclub sequence, Arthur Blake performs impersonations of Carmen Miranda, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Bette Davis. Caetano Veloso appeared dressed as Miranda in January 1972, in his first show after his return to Brazil from London.\nJimmy Buffett's 1973 album \"A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean\" contains the song \"They Don't Dance Like Carmen No More\".\nMusician Leslie Fish wrote and recorded a song called \"Carmen Miranda's Ghost\" on her 1989 album of the same name. The song describes the chaos that ensues when the singer's ghost appears on a space station. It was later the basis for a multi-author short story anthology edited by Don Sakers. John Cale's 1989 \"Words for the Dying\" features a song co-written with Brian Eno titled \"The Soul of Carmen Miranda\".\nHelena Solberg filmed a documentary, ', in 1995. Eduardo Dusek recorded a cover version of the song \"T\u00e1-Hi (Pra Voc\u00ea Gostar de Mim)\", written by Joubert de Carvalho and recorded by Miranda in 1930, for the 2003 telenovela \"Chocolate com Pimenta\". In 2004, Caetano Veloso and David Byrne performed live at Carnegie Hall a song they had written together, \"Dreamworld: Marco de Canaveses\", that pays homage to Miranda. In 2007, BBC Four produced \"Carmen Miranda \u2013 Beneath the Tutti Frutti Hat\", a one-hour documentary which included interviews with biographer Ruy Castro, niece Carminha and Mickey Rooney. That year, singer Ivete Sangalo recorded a cover version of the song \"Chica Chica Boom Chic\" for the DVD '.

It rises in the Giant Mountains of the northern Czech Republic before traversing much of Bohemia (western half of the Czech Republic), then Germany and flowing into the North Sea at Cuxhaven, northwest of Hamburg. Its total length is .\nThe Elbe's major tributaries include the rivers Vltava, Oh\u0159e, Saale, Havel, Mulde, and Schwarze Elster.\nThe Elbe river basin, comprising the Elbe and its tributaries, has a catchment area of , the twelfth largest in Europe. The basin spans four countries; however, it lies almost entirely just in two of them, Germany (65.5%) and the Czech Republic (33.7%, covering about two thirds of the nation's territory). On its southeastern edges, the Elbe river basin also comprises small parts of Austria (0.6%) and Poland (0.2%). The Elbe catchment area is inhabited by 24.4 million people; its biggest cities are Berlin, Hamburg, Prague, Dresden and Leipzig.\nEtymology.\nFirst attested in Latin as ', the name ' means \"river\" or \"river-bed\" and is nothing more than the High German version of a word (\"*alb\u012b\") found elsewhere in Germanic; cf. Old Norse river name ', Swedish ' \"river\", Norwegian ' \"river\", Old English river name ', and Middle Low German \"\" \"river-bed\".\nCourse.\nIn the Czech Republic.\nThe Elbe (Labe) rises on the slopes of Mt. Viol\u00edk at an elevation of in the Giant Mountains on the northwest borders of the Czech Republic. Of the numerous small streams whose waters compose the infant river. After plunging down the of the Elbe Falls, the latter stream unites with the steeply torrential B\u00edl\u00e9 Labe, and thereafter the united stream of the Elbe pursues a southerly course, emerging from the mountain glens at Jarom\u011b\u0159, where it receives \u00dapa and Metuje.\nHere the Elbe enters the vast vale named Polab\u00ed (meaning \"land along the Elbe\"), and continues on southwards through Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 (where Orlice flows in) and then to Pardubice, where it turns sharply to the west. At Kol\u00edn some further on, it bends gradually towards the north-west. At the village of K\u00e1ran\u00fd, a little above Brand\u00fds nad Labem, the Jizera enters in.\nAt M\u011bln\u00edk its stream is more than doubled in volume by the Vltava, a major river which winds northwards through Bohemia. Upstream from the confluence the Vltava is in fact much longer ( against of the Elbe so far), and has a greater discharge and a larger drainage basin. Nonetheless, for historical reasons the river retains the name Elbe, also because at the confluence point it is the Elbe that flows through the main, wider valley while the Vltava flows into the valley to meet the Elbe at almost a right angle, and thus appears to be the tributary river.\nSome distance lower down, at Litom\u011b\u0159ice, the waters of the Elbe are tinted by the reddish Oh\u0159e. Thus augmented, and swollen into a stream wide, the Elbe carves a path through the basaltic mass of the \u010cesk\u00e9 St\u0159edoho\u0159\u00ed, churning its way through a picturesque, deep, narrow and curved rocky gorge.\nIn Germany.\nShortly after crossing the Czech-German frontier, and passing through the sandstone defiles of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains, the stream assumes a north-westerly direction, which on the whole it preserves right to the North Sea.\nThe river rolls through Dresden and finally, beyond Meissen, enters on its long journey across the North German Plain passing along the former western border of East Germany, touching Torgau, Wittenberg, Dessau, Magdeburg, Wittenberge, and Hamburg on the way, and taking on the waters of the Mulde and Saale from the west, and those of the Schwarze Elster, Havel and Elde from the east. In its northern section both banks of the Elbe are characterised by flat, very fertile marshlands (Elbe Marshes), former flood plains of the Elbe now diked.\nAt Magdeburg there is a viaduct, the Magdeburg Water Bridge, that carries a canal and its shipping traffic over the Elbe and its banks, allowing shipping traffic to pass under it unhindered.\nFrom the sluice of Geesthacht (at kilometre 586) on downstream the Elbe is subject to the tides, the tidal Elbe section is called the Unterelbe (Low Elbe). Soon the Elbe reaches Hamburg. Within the city-state the Unterelbe has a number of branch streams, such as Dove Elbe, Gose Elbe, K\u00f6hlbrand, Norderelbe (Northern Elbe), Reiherstieg, S\u00fcderelbe (Southern Elbe). Some of which have been disconnected for vessels from the main stream by dikes. In 1390 the Gose Elbe (literally in ) was separated from the main stream by a dike connecting the two then-islands of Kirchwerder and Neuengamme. The Dove Elbe (literally in ) was diked off in 1437/38 at Gammer Ort. These hydraulic engineering works were carried out to protect marshlands from inundation, and to improve the water supply of the Port of Hamburg. After the heavy inundation by the North Sea flood of 1962 the western section of the Southern Elbe was separated, becoming the Old Southern Elbe, while the waters of the eastern Southern Elbe now merge into the K\u00f6hlbrand, which is bridged by the K\u00f6hlbrandbr\u00fccke, the last bridge over the Elbe before the North Sea.\nThe Northern Elbe passes the Elbe Philharmonic Hall and is then crossed under by the old Elbe Tunnel (Alter Elbtunnel), both in Hamburg's city centre. A bit more downstream, the Low Elbe's two main anabranches Northern Elbe and the K\u00f6hlbrand reunite south of Altona-Altstadt, a locality of Hamburg. Right after both anabranches reunite, the Low Elbe is passed under by the New Elbe Tunnel (Neuer Elbtunnel), the last structural road link crossing the river before the North Sea. At the bay M\u00fchlenberger Loch in Hamburg at kilometre 634, the Northern Elbe and the Southern Elbe (here now the cut-off meander Old Southern Elbe) used to reunite, which is why the bay is seen as the starting point of the Niederelbe (Lower Elbe). Leaving the city-state the Lower Elbe then passes between Holstein and the Elbe-Weser Triangle with Stade until it flows into the North Sea at Cuxhaven. Near its mouth, it passes the entrance to the Kiel Canal at Brunsb\u00fcttel before it debouches into the North Sea.\nNavigation.\nThe Elbe has always been navigable by commercial vessels, and provides important trade links as far inland as Prague. The river is linked by canals (Elbe Lateral Canal, Elbe-Havel Canal, Mittellandkanal) to the industrial areas of Germany and to Berlin. The Elbe-L\u00fcbeck Canal links the Elbe to the Baltic Sea, as does the Kiel Canal, whose western entrance is near the mouth of the Elbe. The Elbe-Weser Shipping Channel connects the Elbe with the Weser.\nBy the Treaty of Versailles the navigation on the Elbe became subject to the International Commission of the Elbe, seated in Dresden. The statute of the commission was signed in Dresden on 22 February 1922. Following articles 363 and 364 of the Treaty of Versailles, Czechoslovakia was entitled to lease its own harbour basin, Moldauhafen in Hamburg. The contract of lease with Germany, and supervised by the United Kingdom, was signed on 14 February 1929, ending in 2028. Since 1993 the Czech Republic holds the former Czechoslovak legal position.\nBefore Germany was reunited, waterway transport in Western Germany was hindered by the fact that inland navigation to Hamburg had to pass through the German Democratic Republic. The Elbe-Seitenkanal (Elbe Lateral Canal) was built between the West German section of the Mittellandkanal and the Lower Elbe to restore this connection. When the two nations were reunited, works were begun to improve and restore the original links: the Magdeburg Water Bridge now allows large barges to cross the Elbe without having to enter the river. The often low water levels of the Elbe no longer hinder navigation to Berlin.\nFerries.\nThe Elbe is crossed by many ferries, both passenger and car carrying. In downstream order, these include:\nMany of these ferries are traditional reaction ferries, a type of cable ferry that uses the current flow of the river to provide propulsion.\nPrehistory.\nHumans first lived in the northern Elbe region before about 200,000 years ago, during the Middle Paleolithic.\nHistory.\nPtolemy recorded the Elbe as ' (Germanic for \"river\") in Germania Magna, with its source in the ' mountains (Giant Mountains), where the Germanic \" then lived.\nThe Elbe has long served as an important delineator of European geography. The Romans knew the river as the \"; however, they made only one serious attempt to move the border of their empire forward from the Rhine to the Elbe, and this attempt failed with the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9\u00a0AD, after which they never seriously tried again. In the Middle Ages the Elbe formed the eastern limit of the Empire of Charlemagne (King of the Franks from 769 to 814). The river's navigable sections were essential to the success of the Hanseatic League in the Late Middle Ages, and much trade was carried on its waters.\nFrom the early 6th century Slavic tribes (known as the Polabian Slavs) settled in the areas east of the rivers Elbe and Saale (which had been depopulated since the 4th century). In the 10th century the Ottonian Dynasty (dominant from 919 to 1024) began conquering these lands; a slow process of Germanization ensued, including the Wendish Crusade of 1147.\nThe Elbe delineated the western parts of Germany from the eastern so-called East Elbia, where soccage and serfdom were more strict and prevailed longer than westwards of the river, and where feudal lords held bigger estates than in the west. Thus incumbents of huge land-holdings became characterised as East Elbian Junkers. The Northern German area north of the Lower Elbe used to be called North Albingia in the Middle Ages. When the four Lutheran church bodies there united in 1977 they chose the name North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church. Other, administrative units were named after the river Elbe, such as the Westphalian \"Elbe d\u00e9partement\" (1807\u20131813) and \"Lower Elbe d\u00e9partement\" (1810), and the French d\u00e9partement Bouches-de-l'Elbe (1811\u20131814).\nOn 10 April 1945, General Wenck of the German Twelfth Army located to the west of Berlin to guard against the advancing American and British forces. But, as the Western Front moved eastwards and the Eastern Front moved westwards, the German armies making up both fronts backed towards each other. As a result, the area of control of Wenck's army to his rear and east of the Elbe River had become a vast refugee camp for Germans fleeing from the approaching Soviet Army. Wenck took great pains to provide food and lodging for these refugees. At one stage, the Twelfth Army was estimated to be feeding more than a quarter of a million people every day. During the night of 28 April, Wenck reported to the German Supreme Army Command in Fuerstenberg that his Twelfth Army had been forced back along the entire front. According to Wenck, no attack on Berlin was possible as support from Busse's Ninth Army could no longer be expected. Instead, starting April 24, Wenck moved his army towards the Forest of Halbe, broke into the Halbe pocket and linked up with the remnants of the Ninth Army, Hellmuth Reymann's \"Army Group Spree\", and the Potsdam garrison. Wenck brought his army, remnants of the Ninth Army, and many civilian refugees across the Elbe and into territory occupied by the U.S. Army.\nIn 1945, as World War II drew to a close, Germany came under attack from the armies of the western Allies advancing from the west and those of the Soviet Union advancing from the east. On 25 April 1945 these two forces linked up near Torgau, on the Elbe. The victorious countries marked the event unofficially as Elbe Day. From 1949 to 1990 the Elbe formed part of the Inner German border between East Germany and West Germany.\nDuring the 1970s the Soviet Union stated that Adolf Hitler's ashes had been scattered in the Elbe following disinterment from their original burial-site.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "50767", "revid": "40781349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50767", "title": "Privateer", "text": "Person or ship engaging in maritime warfare under commission\nA privateer is a private person or vessel which engages in commerce raiding under a commission of war. Since robbery under arms was a common aspect of seaborne trade, until the early 19th century all merchant ships carried arms. A sovereign or delegated authority issued commissions, also referred to as letters of marque, during wartime. The commission empowered the holder to carry on all forms of hostility permissible at sea by the usages of war. This included attacking foreign vessels and taking them as prizes and taking crews prisoner for exchange. Captured ships were subject to condemnation and sale under prize law, with the proceeds divided by percentage between the privateer's sponsors, shipowners, captains and crew. A percentage share usually went to the issuer of the commission (i.e. the sovereign). Most colonial powers, as well as other countries, engaged in privateering.\nPrivateering allowed sovereigns to augment their naval forces at relatively low cost by mobilizing privately owned armed ships and sailors to supplement state power. For participants, privateering provided the potential for a greater income and profit than obtainable as a merchant seafarer or fisher while avoiding the dangers associated with outright piracy. However, the line between privateers and pirates was not always clear.\nThe commission usually protected privateers from accusations of piracy, but in practice the historical legality and status of privateers could be vague. Depending on the specific sovereign and the time period, commissions might be issued hastily; privateers might take actions beyond what was authorized in the commission, including after its expiry. A privateer who continued raiding after the expiration of a commission or the signing of a peace treaty could face accusations of piracy. The risk of piracy and the emergence of the modern state system of centralised military control caused the decline of privateering by the end of the 19th century.\nLegal framework and relation to piracy.\nThe commission was the proof the privateer was not a pirate. It usually limited activity to one particular ship, and specified officers, for a specific period of time. Typically, the owners or captain would be required to post a performance bond. The commission also dictated the expected nationality of potential prize ships under the terms of the war. At sea, the privateer captain was obliged to produce the commission to a potential prize ship's captain as evidence of the legitimacy of their prize claim. If the nationality of a prize was not the enemy of the commissioning sovereign, the privateer could not claim the ship as a prize. Doing so would be an act of piracy.\nIn British law, under the Offences at Sea Act 1536, piracy, or raiding a ship without a valid commission, was an act of treason. By the late 17th century, the prosecution of privateers loyal to the usurped King James II for piracy began to shift the legal framework of piracy away from treason towards crime against property. As a result, privateering commissions became a matter of national discretion. By the passing of the Piracy Act 1717, a privateer's allegiance to Britain overrode any allegiance to a sovereign providing the commission. This helped bring privateers under the legal jurisdiction of their home country in the event the privateer turned pirate. Other European countries followed suit. The shift from treason to property also justified the criminalisation of traditional sea-raiding activities of people Europeans wished to colonise.\nThe legal framework around authorised sea-raiding was considerably murkier outside of Europe. Unfamiliarity with local forms of authority created difficulty determining who was legitimately sovereign on land and at sea, whether to accept their authority, or whether the opposing parties were, in fact, pirates. Mediterranean corsairs operated with a style of patriotic-religious authority that Europeans, and later Americans, found difficult to understand and accept. It did not help that many European privateers happily accepted commissions from the deys of Algiers, Tangiers and Tunis. The sultans of the Sulu archipelago (now present-day Philippines) held only a tenuous authority over the local Iranun communities of slave-raiders. The sultans created a carefully spun web of marital and political alliances in an attempt to control unauthorised raiding that would provoke war against them. In Malay political systems, the legitimacy and strength of their Sultan's management of trade determined the extent he exerted control over the sea-raiding of his coastal people.\nPrivateers were implicated in piracy for a number of complex reasons. For colonial authorities, successful privateers were skilled seafarers who brought in much-needed revenue, especially in newly settled colonial outposts. These skills and benefits often caused local authorities to overlook a privateer's shift into piracy when a war ended. The French Governor of Petit-Goave gave buccaneer Francois Grogniet blank privateering commissions, which Grogniet traded to Edward Davis for a spare ship so the two could continue raiding Spanish cities under a guise of legitimacy. New York Governors Jacob Leisler and Benjamin Fletcher were removed from office in part for their dealings with pirates such as Thomas Tew, to whom Fletcher had granted commissions to sail against the French, but who ignored his commission to raid Mughal shipping in the Red Sea instead.\nSome privateers faced prosecution for piracy. William Kidd accepted a commission from King William III of England to hunt pirates but was later hanged for piracy. He had been unable to produce the papers of the prizes he had captured to prove his innocence.\nPrivateering commissions were easy to obtain during wartime but when the war ended and sovereigns recalled the privateers, many refused to give up the lucrative business and turned to piracy. Boston minister Cotton Mather lamented after the execution of pirate John Quelch: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Yea, since the privateering stroke so easily degenerates into the piratical and the privateering trade is usually carried on with so un-Christian a temper and proves an inlet unto so much debauchery and iniquity and confusion, I believe I shall have good men concur with me in wishing that privateering may no more be practised except there may appear more hopeful circumstances to encourage it.\nNoted privateers.\nPrivateers who were considered legitimate by their governments include:\nShips.\nEntrepreneurs converted many different types of vessels into privateers, including obsolete warships and refitted merchant ships. The investors would arm the vessels and recruit large crews, much larger than a merchantman or a naval vessel would carry, in order to crew the prizes they captured. Privateers generally cruised independently, but it was not unknown for them to form squadrons, or to co-operate with the regular navy. A number of privateers were part of the English fleet that opposed the Spanish Armada in 1588. Privateers generally avoided encounters with warships, as such encounters would be at best unprofitable. Still, such encounters did occur. For instance, in 1815 \"Chasseur\" encountered HMS \"St Lawrence\", herself a former American privateer, mistaking her for a merchantman until too late; in this instance, however, the privateer prevailed.\nThe United States used mixed squadrons of frigates and privateers in the American Revolutionary War. Following the French Revolution, French privateers became a menace to British and American shipping in the western Atlantic and the Caribbean, resulting in the Quasi-War, a brief conflict between France and the United States, fought largely at sea, and to the Royal Navy's procuring Bermuda sloops to combat the French privateers.\nOverall history.\nIn Europe, the practice of authorising sea-raiding dated to at least the 13th century but the word 'privateer' was coined sometime in the mid-17th century. Seamen who served on naval vessels were paid wages and given victuals, whereas mariners on merchantmen and privateers received a share of the takings. Privateering thus offered otherwise working-class enterprises (merchant ships) with the chance at substantial wealth (prize money from captures). The opportunity mobilized local seamen as auxiliaries in an era when state capacity limited the ability of a nation to fund a professional navy via taxation. \nPrivateers were a large part of the total military force at sea during the 17th and 18th centuries. In the first Anglo-Dutch War, English privateers attacked the trade on which the United Provinces entirely depended, capturing over 1,000 Dutch merchant ships. During the subsequent war with Spain, Spanish and Flemish privateers in the service of the Spanish Crown, including the Dunkirkers, captured 1,500 English merchant ships, helping to restore Dutch international trade. British trade, whether coastal, Atlantic, or Mediterranean, was also attacked by Dutch privateers and others in the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch wars. Piet Pieterszoon Hein was a brilliantly successful Dutch privateer who captured a Spanish treasure fleet. Magnus Heinason was another privateer who served the Dutch against the Spanish. While their and others' attacks brought home a great deal of money, they hardly dented the flow of gold and silver from Mexico to Spain.\nAs the Industrial Revolution proceeded, privateering became increasingly incompatible with modern states' monopoly on violence. Modern warships could easily outrace merchantmen, and tight controls on naval armaments led to fewer private-purchase naval weapons. Privateering continued until the 1856 Declaration of Paris, in which all major European powers stated that \"Privateering is and remains abolished\". The United States did not sign the Declaration over stronger language that protects all private property from capture at sea, but has not issued letters of marque in any subsequent conflicts. In the 19th century, many nations passed laws forbidding their nationals from accepting commissions as privateers for other nations. The last major power to flirt with privateering was Prussia in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War, when Prussia announced the creation of a 'volunteer navy' of ships privately owned and -manned, but eligible for prize money. (Prussia argued that the Declaration did not forbid such a force, because the ships were subject to naval discipline.) \nEngland/Britain.\nIn England, and later the United Kingdom, the ubiquity of wars and the island nation's reliance on maritime trade enabled the use of privateers to great effect. England also suffered much from other nations' privateering. During the 15th century, the country \"lacked an institutional structure and coordinated finance\". When piracy became an increasing problem, merchant communities such as Bristol began to resort to self-help, arming and equipping ships at their own expense to protect commerce. The licensing of these privately owned merchant ships by the Crown enabled them to legitimately capture vessels that were deemed pirates. This constituted a \"revolution in naval strategy\" and helped fill the need for protection that the Crown was unable to provide.\nDuring the reign of Queen Elizabeth (1558\u20131603), she \"encouraged the development of this supplementary navy\". Over the course of her rule, the increase of Spanish prosperity through their explorations in the New World and the discovery of gold contributed to the deterioration of Anglo-Spanish relations. Elizabeth's authorisation of sea-raiders (known as Sea Dogs) such as Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh allowed her to officially distance herself from their raiding activities while enjoying the gold gained from these raids. English ships cruised in the Caribbean and off the coast of Spain, trying to intercept treasure fleets from the Spanish Main. During the Anglo-Spanish War (1585-1604) England continued to rely on private ships-of-war to attack Iberian shipping because the Queen had insufficient finance to fund this herself. After the war ended many unemployed English privateers turned to piracy.\nElizabeth was succeeded by the first Stuart monarchs, James I and Charles I, who did not permit privateering. Desperate to fund the expensive War of Spanish Succession, Queen Anne restarted privateering and even removed the need for a sovereign's percentage as an incentive. Sovereigns continued to license British privateers throughout the century, although there were a number of unilateral and bilateral declarations limiting privateering between 1785 and 1823. This helped establish the privateer's persona as heroic patriots. British privateers last appeared \"en masse\" in the Napoleonic Wars.\nEngland and Scotland practiced privateering both separately and together after they united to create the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. It was a way to gain for themselves some of the wealth the Spanish and Portuguese were taking from the New World before beginning their own trans-Atlantic settlement, and a way to assert naval power before a strong Royal Navy emerged.\nSir Andrew Barton, Lord High Admiral of Scotland, followed the example of his father, who had been issued with letters of marque by James III of Scotland to prey upon English and Portuguese shipping in 1485; the letters in due course were reissued to the son. Barton was killed following an encounter with the English in 1511.\nSir Francis Drake, who had close contact with the sovereign, was responsible for some damage to Spanish shipping, as well as attacks on Spanish settlements in the Americas in the 16th century. He participated in the successful English defence against the Spanish Armada in 1588, though he was also partly responsible for the failure of the English Armada against Spain in 1589.\nSir George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland, was a successful privateer against Spanish shipping in the Caribbean. He is also famous for his short-lived 1598 capture of \"Fort San Felipe del Morro\", the citadel protecting San Juan, Puerto Rico. He arrived in Puerto Rico on June 15, 1598, but by November of that year, Clifford and his men had fled the island due to fierce civilian resistance. He gained sufficient prestige from his naval exploits to be named the official Champion of Queen Elizabeth I. Clifford became extremely wealthy through his buccaneering but lost most of his money gambling on horse races.\nCaptain Christopher Newport led more attacks on Spanish shipping and settlements than any other English privateer. As a young man, Newport sailed with Sir Francis Drake in the attack on the Spanish fleet at Cadiz and participated in England's defeat of the Spanish Armada. During the war with Spain, Newport seized fortunes of Spanish and Portuguese treasure in fierce sea battles in the West Indies as a privateer for Queen Elizabeth I. He lost an arm whilst capturing a Spanish ship during an expedition in 1590, but despite this, he continued on privateering, successfully blockading Western Cuba the following year. In 1592, Newport captured the Portuguese carrack \"Madre de Deus\" (Mother of God), valued at \u00a3500,000.\nSir Henry Morgan was a successful privateer. Operating out of Jamaica, he carried on a war against Spanish interests in the region, often using cunning tactics. His operation was prone to cruelty against those he captured, including torture to gain information about booty, and in one case using priests as human shields. Despite reproaches for some of his excesses, he was generally protected by Sir Thomas Modyford, the governor of Jamaica. He took an enormous amount of booty, as well as landing his privateers ashore and attacking land fortifications, including the sack of the city of Panama with only 1,400 crew.\nOther British privateers of note include Fortunatus Wright, Edward Collier, Sir John Hawkins, his son Sir Richard Hawkins, Michael Geare, and Sir Christopher Myngs. Notable British colonial privateers in Nova Scotia include Alexander Godfrey of the brig and Joseph Barss of the schooner . The latter schooner captured over 50 American vessels during the War of 1812.\nBermudians.\nThe English colony of Bermuda (or the \"Somers Isles\"), settled accidentally in 1609, was used as a base for English privateers from the time it officially became part of the territory of the Virginia Company in 1612, especially by ships belonging to Robert Rich, the Earl of Warwick, for whom Bermuda's Warwick Parish is named (the Warwick name had long been associated with commerce raiding, as exampled by the Newport Ship, thought to have been taken from the Spanish by Warwick the Kingmaker in the 15th century). Many Bermudians were employed as crew aboard privateers throughout the century, although the colony was primarily devoted to farming cash crops until turning from its failed agricultural economy to the sea after the 1684 dissolution of the Somers Isles Company (a spin-off of the Virginia Company, which had overseen the colony since 1615). With a total area of and lacking any natural resources other than the Bermuda cedar, the colonists applied themselves fully to the maritime trades, developing the speedy Bermuda sloop, which was well suited both to commerce and to commerce raiding. Bermudian merchant vessels turned to privateering at every opportunity in the 18th century, preying on the shipping of Spain, France, and other nations during a series of wars, including the 1688 to 1697 Nine Years' War (King William's War); the 1702 to 1713 Queen Anne's War; the 1739 to 1748 War of Jenkins' Ear; the 1740 to 1748 War of the Austrian Succession (King George's War); the 1754 to 1763 Seven Years' War (known in the United States as the French and Indian War), this conflict was devastating for the colony's merchant fleet. Fifteen privateers operated from Bermuda during the war, but losses exceeded captures; the 1775 to 1783 American War of Independence; and the 1796 to 1808 Anglo-Spanish War. By the middle of the 18th century, Bermuda was sending twice as many privateers to sea as any of the continental colonies. They typically left Bermuda with very large crews. This advantage in manpower was vital in overpowering the crews of larger vessels, which themselves often lacked sufficient crewmembers to put up a strong defence. The extra crewmen were also useful as prize crews for returning captured vessels.\nThe Bahamas, which had been depopulated of its indigenous inhabitants by the Spanish, had been settled by England, beginning with the Eleutheran Adventurers, dissident Puritans driven out of Bermuda during the English Civil War. Spanish and French attacks destroyed New Providence in 1703, creating a stronghold for pirates, and it became a thorn in the side of British merchant trade through the area. In 1718, Britain appointed Woodes Rogers as Governor of the Bahamas, and sent him at the head of a force to reclaim the settlement. Before his arrival, however, the pirates had been forced to surrender by a force of Bermudian privateers who had been issued letters of marque by the Governor of Bermuda.\nBermuda was in de facto control of the Turks Islands, with their lucrative salt industry, from the late 17th century to the early 19th. The Bahamas made perpetual attempts to claim the Turks for itself. On several occasions, this involved seizing the vessels of Bermudian salt traders. A virtual state of war was said to exist between Bermudian and Bahamian vessels for much of the 18th century. When the Bermudian sloop \"Seaflower\" was seized by the Bahamians in 1701, the response of the Governor of Bermuda, Captain Benjamin Bennett, was to issue letters of marque to Bermudian vessels. In 1706, Spanish and French forces ousted the Bermudians but were driven out themselves three years later by the Bermudian privateer Captain Lewis Middleton. His ship, the \"Rose\", attacked a Spanish and a French privateer holding a captive English vessel. Defeating the two enemy vessels, the \"Rose\" then cleared out the thirty-man garrison left by the Spanish and French.\nDespite strong sentiments in support of the rebels, especially in the early stages, Bermudian privateers turned as aggressively on American shipping during the American War of Independence. The importance of privateering to the Bermudian economy had been increased not only by the loss of most of Bermuda's continental trade but also by the Palliser Act, which forbade Bermudian vessels from fishing the Grand Banks. Bermudian trade with the rebellious American colonies actually carried on throughout the war. Some historians credit the large number of Bermuda sloops (reckoned at over a thousand) built-in Bermuda as privateers and sold illegally to the Americans as enabling the rebellious colonies to win their independence. Also, the Americans were dependent on Turks salt, and one hundred barrels of gunpowder were stolen from a Bermudian magazine and supplied to the rebels as orchestrated by Colonel Henry Tucker and Benjamin Franklin, and as requested by George Washington, in exchange for which the Continental Congress authorised the sale of supplies to Bermuda, which was dependent on American produce. The realities of this interdependence did nothing to dampen the enthusiasm with which Bermudian privateers turned on their erstwhile countrymen.\nAn American naval captain, ordered to take his ship out of Boston Harbor to eliminate a pair of Bermudian privateering vessels that had been picking off vessels missed by the Royal Navy, returned frustrated, saying, \"the Bermudians sailed their ships two feet for every one of ours\". Around 10,000 Bermudians emigrated in the years prior to American independence, mostly to the American colonies. Many Bermudians occupied prominent positions in American seaports, from where they continued their maritime trades (Bermudian merchants controlled much of the trade through ports like Charleston, South Carolina, and Bermudian shipbuilders influenced the development of American vessels, like the Chesapeake Bay schooner), and in the Revolution they used their knowledge of Bermudians and of Bermuda, as well as their vessels, for the rebels' cause. In the 1777 Battle of Wreck Hill, brothers Charles and Francis Morgan, members of a large Bermudian enclave that had dominated Charleston, South Carolina and its environs since settlement, captaining two sloops (the \"Fair American\" and the \"Experiment\", respectively), carried out the only attack on Bermuda during the war. The target was a fort that guarded a little used passage through the encompassing reef line. After the soldiers manning the fort were forced to abandon it, they spiked its guns and fled themselves before reinforcements could arrive.\nWhen the Americans captured the Bermudian privateer \"Regulator\", they discovered that virtually all of her crew were black slaves. Authorities in Boston offered these men their freedom, but all 70 elected to be treated as prisoners of war. Sent as such to New York on the sloop \"Duxbury\", they seized the vessel and sailed it back to Bermuda. One-hundred and thirty prizes were brought to Bermuda in the year between 4th day of April 1782 and the 4th day of April 1783 alone, including three by Royal Naval vessels and the remainder by privateers.\nThe War of 1812 saw an encore of Bermudian privateering, which had died out after the 1790s. The decline of Bermudian privateering was due partly to the buildup of the naval base in Bermuda, which reduced the Admiralty's reliance on privateers in the western Atlantic, and partly to successful American legal suits and claims for damages pressed against British privateers, a large portion of which were aimed squarely at the Bermudians. During the course of the War of 1812, Bermudian privateers captured 298 ships, some 19% of the 1,593 vessels captured by British naval and privateering vessels between the Great Lakes and the West Indies.\nAmong the better known (native-born and immigrant) Bermudian privateers were Hezekiah Frith, Bridger Goodrich, Henry Jennings, Thomas Hewetson, and Thomas Tew.\nProvidence Island colony.\nBermudians were also involved in privateering from the short-lived English colony on Isla de Providencia, off the coast of Nicaragua. This colony was initially settled largely via Bermuda, with about eighty Bermudians moved to Providence in 1631. Although it was intended that the colony be used to grow cash crops, its location in the heart of the Spanish controlled territory ensured that it quickly became a base for privateering.\nBermuda-based privateer Daniel Elfrith, while on a privateering expedition with Captain Sussex Camock of the bark \"Somer Ilands\" (a rendering of \"Somers Isles\", the alternate name of the Islands of Bermuda commemorating Admiral Sir George Somers) in 1625, discovered two islands off the coast of Nicaragua, apart from each other. Camock stayed with 30 of his men to explore one of the islands, San Andr\u00e9s, while Elfrith took the Warwicke back to Bermuda bringing news of Providence Island. Bermuda Governor Bell wrote on behalf of Elfrith to Sir Nathaniel Rich, a businessman and cousin of the Earl of Warwick (the namesake of Warwick Parish), who presented a proposal for colonizing the island noting its strategic location \"lying in the heart of the Indies &amp; the mouth of the Spaniards\". Elfrith was appointed admiral of the colony's military forces in 1631, remaining the overall military commander for over seven years. During this time, Elfrith served as a guide to other privateers and sea captains arriving in the Caribbean. Elfrith invited the well-known privateer Diego el Mulato to the island. Samuel Axe, one of the military leaders, also accepted letters of marque from the Dutch authorizing privateering.\nThe Spanish did not hear of the Providence Island colony until 1635 when they captured some Englishmen in Portobelo, on the Isthmus of Panama. Francisco de Murga, Governor and Captain-General of Cartagena, dispatched Captain Gregorio de Castellar y Mantilla and engineer Juan de Somovilla Texada to destroy the colony. The Spanish were repelled and forced to retreat \"in haste and disorder\". After the attack, King Charles I of England issued letters of marque to the Providence Island Company on 21 December 1635 authorizing raids on the Spanish in retaliation for a raid that had destroyed the English colony on Tortuga earlier in 1635 (Tortuga had come under the protection of the Providence Island Company. In 1635 a Spanish fleet raided Tortuga. 195 colonists were hung and 39 prisoners and 30 slaves were captured). The company could in turn issue letters of marque to subcontracting privateers who used the island as a base, for a fee. This soon became an important source of profit. Thus the company made an agreement with the merchant Maurice Thompson under which Thompson could use the island as a base in return for 20% of the booty.\nIn March 1636 the Company dispatched Captain Robert Hunt on the \"Blessing\" to assume the governorship of what was now viewed as a base for privateering. Depredations continued, leading to growing tension between England and Spain, which were still technically at peace.\nOn 11 July 1640, the Spanish Ambassador in London complained again, saying he\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;understands that there is lately brought in at the Isle of Wight by one, Captain James Reskinner [James Reiskimmer], a ship very richly laden with silver, gold, diamonds, pearls, jewels, and many other precious commodities taken by him in virtue of a commission of the said Earl [of Warwick] from the subjects of his Catholic Majesty ... to the infinite wrong and dishonour of his Catholic Majesty, to find himself thus injured and violated, and his subjects thus spoiled, robbed, impoverished and murdered in the highest time of peace, league and amity with your Majesty.\nNathaniel Butler, formerly Governor of Bermuda, was the last full governor of Providence Island, replacing Robert Hunt in 1638. Butler returned to England in 1640, satisfied that the fortifications were adequate, deputizing the governorship to Captain Andrew Carter.\nIn 1640, don Melchor de Aguilera, Governor and Captain-General of Cartagena, resolved to remove the intolerable infestation of pirates on the island. Taking advantage of having infantry from Castile and Portugal wintering in his port, he dispatched six hundred armed Spaniards from the fleet and the presidio, and two hundred black and mulatto militiamen under the leadership of don Antonio Maldonado y Tejada, his Sergeant Major, in six small frigates and a galleon. The troops were landed on the island, and a fierce fight ensued. The Spanish were forced to withdraw when a gale blew up and threatened their ships. Carter had the Spanish prisoners executed. When the Puritan leaders protested against this brutality, Carter sent four of them home in chains.\nThe Spanish acted decisively to avenge their defeat. General Francisco D\u00edaz Pimienta was given orders by King Philip IV of Spain, and sailed from Cartagena to Providence with seven large ships, four pinnaces, 1,400 soldiers and 600 seamen, arriving on 19 May 1641. At first, Pimienta planned to attack the poorly defended east side, and the English rushed there to improvise defenses. With the winds against him, Pimienta changed plans and made for the main New Westminster harbor and launched his attack on 24 May. He held back his large ships to avoid damage, and used the pinnaces to attack the forts. The Spanish troops quickly gained control, and once the forts saw the Spanish flag flying over the governor's house, they began negotiations for surrender.\nOn 25 May 1641, Pimienta formally took possession and celebrated mass in the church. The Spanish took sixty guns, and captured the 350 settlers who remained on the island \u2013 others had escaped to the Mosquito Coast. They took the prisoners to Cartagena. The women and children were given a passage back to England. The Spanish found gold, indigo, cochineal and six hundred black slaves on the island, worth a total of 500,000 ducats, some of the accumulated booty from the raids on Spanish ships. Rather than destroy the defenses, as instructed, Pimienta left a small garrison of 150 men to hold the island and prevent occupation by the Dutch. Later that year, Captain John Humphrey, who had been chosen to succeed Captain Butler as governor, arrived with a large group of dissatisfied settlers from New England. He found the Spanish occupying the islands, and sailed away. Pimienta's decision to occupy the island was approved in 1643 and he was made a knight of the Order of Santiago.\nSpain and its colonies.\nWhen Spain issued a decree blocking foreign countries from trading, selling or buying merchandise in its Caribbean colonies, the entire region became engulfed in a power struggle among the naval superpowers. The newly independent United States later became involved in this scenario, complicating the conflict. As a consequence, Spain increased the issuing of privateering contracts. These contracts allowed an income option to the inhabitants of these colonies that were not related to the Spanish conquistadores. The most well-known privateer corsairs of the eighteenth century in the Spanish colonies were Miguel Enr\u00edquez of Puerto Rico and Jos\u00e9 Campuzano-Polanco of Santo Domingo. Miguel Enr\u00edquez was a Puerto Rican mulatto who abandoned his work as a shoemaker to work as a privateer. Such was the success of Enr\u00edquez, that he became one of the wealthiest men in the New World. His fleet was composed of approx. 300 different ships during a career that spanned 35 years, becoming a military asset and reportedly outperforming the efficiency of the Armada de Barlovento. Enr\u00edquez was knighted and received the title of Don from Philip V, something unheard of due to his ethnic and social background. One of the most famous privateers from Spain was Amaro Pargo.\nFrance.\n\"Corsairs\" (French: corsaire) were privateers, authorized to conduct raids on shipping of a nation at war with France, on behalf of the French Crown. Seized vessels and cargo were sold at auction, with the corsair captain entitled to a portion of the proceeds. Although not French Navy personnel, corsairs were considered legitimate combatants in France (and allied nations), provided the commanding officer of the vessel was in possession of a valid Letter of Marque (fr. \"Lettre de Marque\" or \"Lettre de Course\"), and the officers and crew conducted themselves according to contemporary admiralty law. By acting on behalf of the French Crown, if captured by the enemy, they could claim treatment as prisoners of war, instead of being considered pirates. Because corsairs gained a swashbuckling reputation, the word \"corsair\" is also used generically as a more romantic or flamboyant way of referring to privateers, or even to pirates. The Barbary pirates of North Africa as well as Ottomans were sometimes called \"Turkish corsairs\".\nMalta.\nCorsairing () was an important aspect of Malta's economy when the island was ruled by the Order of St. John, although the practice had begun earlier. Corsairs sailed on privately owned ships on behalf of the Grand Master of the Order, and were authorized to attack Muslim ships, usually merchant ships from the Ottoman Empire. The corsairs included knights of the Order, native Maltese people, as well as foreigners. When they captured a ship, the goods were sold and the crew and passengers were ransomed or enslaved, and the Order took a percentage of the value of the booty. Corsairing remained common until the end of the 18th century.\nUnited States.\nBritish Colonial period.\nDuring King George's War, approximately 36,000 Americans served aboard privateers at one time or another. During the Nine Years War, the French adopted a policy of strongly encouraging privateers, including the famous Jean Bart, to attack English and Dutch shipping. England lost roughly 4,000 merchant ships during the war. In the following War of Spanish Succession, privateer attacks continued, Britain losing 3,250 merchant ships.\nIn the subsequent conflict, the War of Austrian Succession, the Royal Navy was able to concentrate more on defending British ships. Britain lost 3,238 merchantmen, a smaller fraction of her merchant marine than the enemy losses of 3,434. While French losses were proportionally severe, the smaller but better protected Spanish trade suffered the least and it was Spanish privateers who enjoyed much of the best-allied plunder of British trade, particularly in the West Indies.\nAmerican Revolutionary War.\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress, and some state governments (on their own initiative), issued privateering licenses, authorizing \"legal piracy\", to merchant captains in an effort to target British merchant shipping and to a lesser extent warships, supply ships and privateers. This was done due to the relatively small number of commissioned American naval vessels and the pressing need for prisoner exchange.\nAbout 55,000 American seamen served aboard the privateers. They quickly sold their prizes, dividing their profits with the financier (persons or company) and the state (colony). Long Island Sound became a hornets' nest of privateering activity during the American Revolution (1775\u20131783), as most transports to and from New York went through the Sound. New London, Connecticut was a chief privateering port for the American colonies, leading to the Royal Navy to blockade between 1778 and 1779. Chief financiers of privateering included Thomas &amp; Nathaniel Shaw of New London and John McCurdy of Lyme. In the months before the British raids on New London and Groton, a New London privateer took \"Hannah\" in what is regarded as the largest prize taken by any American privateer during the war. Retribution was likely part of Gov. Clinton's (NY) motivation for Arnold's Raid, as the \"Hannah\" had carried many of his most cherished possessions.\nAmerican privateers are thought to have captured up to 300 British ships during the war. The British ship \"Jack\" was captured and turned into an American privateer, only to be captured again by the British in the naval battle off Halifax, Nova Scotia. American privateers not only fought naval battles but also raided numerous communities in British colonies, such as the Raid on Lunenburg, Nova Scotia (1782).\nThe United States Constitution authorized the U.S. Congress to grant letters of marque and reprisal. Between the end of the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, less than 30 years, Britain, France, Naples, the Barbary States, Spain, and the Netherlands seized approximately 2,500 American ships. Payments in ransom and tribute to the Barbary states amounted to 20% of United States government annual revenues in 1800 and would lead the United States to fight the Barbary states in the First Barbary War and Second Barbary Wars.\nWar of 1812.\nDuring the War of 1812, both the British and the American governments used privateers, and the established system was very similar. U.S. Congress declared that war be and the same is hereby declared to exist between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the dependencies thereof, and the United States of America and their Territories; and that the President of the United States is herby authorized to use the whole land and naval force of the United States to carry the same into effect, and to issue to private armed vessels of the United States commissions of marque and general reprisal, in such forms as he shall think proper, and under the seal of the United States, against the vessels, goods, and effects of the Government of the said United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and the subjects thereof.President Madison issued 500 letters of marque authorizing privateers. Overall some 200 of the ships took prizes. The cost of buying and fitting of a large privateer was about $40,000 and prizes could net $100,000.\nCaptain Thomas Boyle was one of the famous and successful American privateers. He commanded the Baltimore schooner \"Comet\" and then later in the war the Baltimore clipper \"Chasseur\". He captured over 50 British merchant ships during the war. One source estimated a total damage to the British merchant navy from \"Chasseur\"'s 1813-1815 activities at one and a half million dollars. In total, the Baltimore privateer fleet of 122 ships sunk or seized 500 British ships with an estimated value of $16\u00a0million, which accounts about one-third of all the value of all prizes taken over the course of the whole war. \nOn April 8, 1814, the British attacked Essex, Connecticut, and burned the ships in the harbor, due to the construction there of a number of privateers. This was the greatest financial loss of the entire War of 1812 suffered by the Americans. However, the private fleet of James De Wolf, which sailed under the flag of the American government in 1812, was most likely a key factor in the naval campaign of the war. De Wolf's ship, the \"Yankee\", was possibly the most financially successful ship of the war. Privateers proved to be far more successful than their US Navy counterparts, claiming three-quarters of the 1600 British merchant ships taken during the war (although a third of these were recaptured prior to making landfall). One of the more successful of these ships was the \"Prince de Neufchatel\", which once captured nine British prizes in swift succession in the English Channel.\nJean Lafitte and his privateers aided US General Andrew Jackson in the defeat of the British in the Battle of New Orleans in order to receive full pardons for their previous crimes. Jackson formally requested clemency for Lafitte and the men who had served under him, and the US government granted them all a full pardon on February 6, 1815.\nHowever, many of the ships captured by the Americans were recaptured by the Royal Navy. British convoy systems honed during the Napoleonic Wars limited losses to singleton ships, and the effective blockade of American and continental ports prevented captured ships being taken in for sale. This ultimately led to orders forbidding US privateers from attempting to bring their prizes in to port, with captured ships instead having to be burnt. Over 200 American privateer ships were captured by the Royal Navy, many of which were turned on their former owners and used by the British blockading forces. Nonetheless, during the War of 1812 the privateers \"swept out from America's coasts, capturing and sinking as many as 2,500 British ships and doing approximately $40 million worth of damage to the British economy.\"\n1856 Declaration of Paris.\nThe US was not one of the initial signatories of the 1856 Declaration of Paris which outlawed privateering, and the Confederate Constitution authorized use of privateers. However, the US did offer to adopt the terms of the Declaration during the American Civil War, when the Confederates sent several privateers to sea before putting their main effort in the more effective commissioned raiders.\nAmerican Civil War.\nDuring the American Civil War, privateering took on several forms including blockade running, while privateering generally occurred in the interests of both the North and the South. Letters of marque would often be issued to private shipping companies and other private owners of ships, authorizing them to engage vessels deemed to be unfriendly to the issuing government. Crews of ships were awarded the cargo and other prizes aboard any captured vessel as an incentive to search far and wide for ships attempting to supply the Confederacy, or aid the Union, as the case may be.\nDuring the Civil War Confederate President Jefferson Davis issued letters of marque to anyone who would employ their ship to either attack Union shipping or bring badly needed supplies through the Union blockade into southern ports.\nMost of the supplies brought into the Confederacy were carried aboard privately owned vessels. When word came about that the Confederacy was willing to pay almost any price for military supplies, various interested parties designed and built specially designed lightweight seagoing steamers, blockade runners specifically designed and built to outrun Union ships on blockade patrol.\nNeither the United States nor Spain authorized privateers in their war in 1898.\nLatin America.\nWarships were recruited by the insurgent governments during Spanish American wars of independence to destroy Spanish trade, and capture Spanish Merchant vessels. The private armed vessels came largely from the United States. Seamen from Britain, the United States, and France often manned these ships.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50768", "revid": "50873355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50768", "title": "People mover", "text": "Automated small-scale transit systems\nA people mover or automated people mover (APM) is a type of small-scale automated guideway transit system. The term is generally used only to describe systems serving relatively small areas such as airports, downtown districts or theme parks.\nThe term was originally applied to three different systems, developed roughly at the same time. One was Skybus, an automated mass transit system prototyped by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation beginning in 1964. The second, alternately called the People Mover and Minirail, opened in Montreal at Expo 67. Finally the last, called PeopleMover or WEDway PeopleMover, was an attraction that was originally presented by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and that opened at Disneyland in 1967.\nThe term \"people mover\" currently describes technologies such as monorail, rail tracks and maglev. Propulsion may involve conventional on-board electric motors, linear motors or cable traction.\nGenerally speaking, larger APMs are referred to by other names. The most generic is \"automated guideway transit\", which encompasses any automated system regardless of size. Some complex APMs deploy fleets of small vehicles over a track network with off-line stations, and supply near non-stop service to passengers. These taxi-like systems are more usually referred to as personal rapid transit (PRT). Larger systems, with vehicles with 20 to 40 passengers, are sometimes referred to as \"group rapid transit\" (GRT), although this term is not particularly common. Other complex APMs have similar characteristics to rapid transit systems, and there is no clear-cut distinction between a complex APM of this type and an automated mass transit system. Another term \"light metro\" is also applied to describe the system worldwide.\nHistory.\nNever-Stop Railway.\nOne of the first automated systems for human transportation was the screw-driven 'Never-Stop-Railway', constructed for the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, London in 1924. This railway consisted of 88 unmanned carriages, on a continuous double track along the northern and eastern sides of the exhibition, with reversing loops at either end.\nThe carriages ran on two parallel concrete beams and were guided by pulleys running on the inner side of these concrete beams, and were propelled by gripping a revolving screw thread running between the tracks in a pit; by adjusting the pitch of this thread at different points, the carriages could be sped up, or slowed down to a walking pace at stations, to allow passengers to join and leave. The railway ran reliably for the two years of the exhibition, and was then dismantled.\nGoodyear and Stephens-Adamson.\nIn late 1949, Mike Kendall, chief engineer and Chairman of the Board of Stephens-Adamson Manufacturing Company, an Illinois-based manufacturer of conveyor belts and systems, asked Al Neilson, an engineer in the Industrial Products Division of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., if Goodyear had ever considered working on People Movers. He felt that with Goodyear's ability to move materials in large quantities on conveyor belts they should consider moving batches of people.\nFour years of engineering design, development and testing led to a joint patent being issued for three types of people movers, named Speedwalk, Speedramp, and Carveyor.\nGoodyear would sell the concept and Stephens-Adamson would manufacture and install the components.\nA Speedwalk consisted of a flat conveyor belt riding on a series of rollers, or a flat slippery surface, moving at (approximately half the speed of walking). The passengers would walk onto the belt and could stand or walk to the exit point. They were supported by a moving handrail. Customers were expected to include airport terminals, ballparks, train stations, etc. Today, several manufacturers produce similar units called moving walkways.\nA Speedramp was very similar to a Speedwalk but it was used to change elevations; up or down a floor level. This could have been accomplished by an escalator, but the Speedramp would allow wheeled luggage, small handcarts etc. to ride the belt at an operating cost predicted to be much lower than escalators or elevators. The first successful installation of a Speedramp was in the spring of 1954 at the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Station in Jersey City, New Jersey, to connect the Erie Railroad to the Hudson and Manhattan Tubes. This unit was long with a rise of on a 15 degree grade, and only cost $75,000.\nA Carveyor consisted of many small cubicles or cars carrying ten people riding on a flat conveyor belt from point A to point B. The belt rode on a series of motorized rollers. The purpose of the motorized rollers was to facilitate the gradual acceleration and deceleration speeds on the conveyor belt and overcome the tendency of all belts to stretch at start up and during shutdown. At point \"A\" passengers would enter a Speedwalk running parallel to the belts and cars of the Carveyor. The cars would be moving at the same speed as the Speedwalk; the passengers would enter the cars and be seated, while the motorized rollers would increase the speed of the cars up to the traveling speed (which would be preset depending on the distance to be covered). At point B Passengers could disembark and by means of a series of flat slower belts (Speedwalks) go to other Carveyors to other destinations or out to the street. The cars at point B would continue on rollers around a semicircle and then reverse the process carrying passengers back to point A. The initial installation was to be the 42nd Street Shuttle in New York City between Times Square and Grand Central station.\nThe first mention of the Carveyor in a hardback book was in \"There's Adventure in Civil Engineering\" by Neil P. Ruzic (1958), one of a series of books published by \"Popular Mechanics\" in the 1950s in their \"Career\" series. In the book the Carveyor was already installed and operational in downtown Los Angeles.\nColonel Sydney H. Bingham, Chairman of the New York City Board of Transportation, had several meetings with a group of architects who were trying to revamp the whole New York City Subway system in the heart of town to connect Pennsylvania Station, Madison Square Garden, Times Square, Grand Central and several new office complexes together. Several of these architects were involved in other programs, and in later years many variations of the Carveyor people movers were developed.\nIn November 1954 the New York City Transit Authority issued an order to Goodyear and Stephens-Adamson to build a complete Carveyor system between Times Square and Grand Central. A brief summary and confirmation can be found in \"Time\" magazine on November 15, 1954. under the heading \"Subway of the Future\". The cost was to be under $4 million, but the order was never fulfilled due to political difficulties.\nChocolate World in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Disneyland in California, and Walt Disney World in Florida are among many locations that have used variations of the Carveyor concept.\nOther developments.\nThe term 'people mover' was used by Walt Disney, when he and his Imagineers were working on the new 1967 Tomorrowland at Disneyland. The name was used as a working title for a new attraction, the PeopleMover. According to Imagineer Bob Gurr, \"the name got stuck,\" and it was no longer a working title.\nStarting in the late 1960s and into the 1970s, people movers were the topic of intense development around the world. Worried about the growing congestion and pollution in downtown areas due to the spread of cars, many countries started studying mass transit systems that would lower capital costs to the point where any city could afford to deploy them. Most of these systems used elevated guideways, which were much less expensive to deploy than tunnels. However, elevating the track causes problems with noise, so traditional steel-wheel-on-rail solutions were rare as they squealed when rounding bends in the rails. Rubber tired solutions were common, but some systems used hovercraft techniques or various magnetic levitation systems.\nTwo major government funded APM projects are notable. In Germany, Mannesmann Demag and Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm developed a system known as Cabinentaxi during the 1970s. Cabinentaxi featured small cars with from four to eight seats that were called to pick up passengers on-demand and drove directly to their destination. The stations were \"offline\", allowing the cabs to stop by moving off the main lines while other cars continued to their destinations. The system was designed so the cars could be adapted to run on top or bottom of the track (but not easily converted from one to the other), allowing dual-track movements from a single elevated guideway only slightly wider than the cars. A test track was completed in 1975 and ran until development was completed in 1979, but no deployments followed and the companies abandoned the system shortly thereafter.\nIn the U.S., a 1966 federal bill provided funding that led to the development of APM systems under the Downtown People Mover Program. Four systems were developed, Rohr's ROMAG, LTV's AirTrans, Ford's APT and Otis Elevator's hovercraft design. A major presentation of the systems was organized as TRANSPO'72 at Dulles International Airport, where the various systems were presented to delegations from numerous cities in the US. Prototype systems and test tracks were built during the 1970s.\nOne notable example was Pittsburgh's Skybus, which was proposed by the Port Authority of Allegheny County to replace its streetcar system, which, having large stretches of private right of way, was not suited for bus conversion. A short demonstration line was set up in South Park and large tracts of land were secured for its facilities. However, opposition arose to the notion that it would replace the streetcar system. This, combined with the immaturity of the technology and other factors, led the Port Authority to abandon the project and pursue alternatives. By the start of the 1980s most politicians had lost interest in the concept and the project was repeatedly de-funded in the early 1980s. Only two APMs were developed as a part of the People Mover Program in the U.S., the Metromover in Miami, and the Detroit People Mover. The Jacksonville Skyway was built in the late 1980s.\nFrom development to implementation.\nAlthough many systems were generally considered failures, several APM systems developed by other groups have been much more successful. Lighter systems with shorter tracks are widely deployed at airports; the world's first airport people movers, the Tampa International Airport People Movers, were installed in 1971 at Tampa International Airport in the United States. APMs have now become common at large airports and hospitals in the United States.\nDriverless metros have become common in Europe and parts of Asia. The economics of automated trains tend to reduce the scale so tied to \"mass\" transit (the largest operating expense is the driver's salary, which is only affordable if very large numbers of passengers are paying fares), so that small-scale installations are feasible. Thus cities normally thought of as too small to build a metro (e.g. Rennes, Lausanne, Brescia, etc.) are now doing so.\nOn September 30, 2006, the Peachliner in Komaki, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, became that nation's first people mover to cease operations.\nExamples.\nAirports.\nMany large international airports around the world feature people mover systems to transport passengers between terminals or within a terminal itself. Some people mover systems at airports connect with other public transportation systems to allow passengers to travel into the airport's city.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
