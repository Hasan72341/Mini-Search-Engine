His 1667 epic poem \"Paradise Lost\" was written in blank verse and included 12 books, written in a time of immense religious flux and political upheaval. It addressed the fall of man, including the temptation of Adam and Eve by the fallen angel Satan, and God's expulsion of them from the Garden of Eden. \"Paradise Lost\" elevated Milton's reputation as one of history's greatest poets. He also served as a civil servant for the Commonwealth of England under its Council of State and later under Oliver Cromwell.\nMilton achieved fame and recognition during his lifetime. His celebrated \"Areopagitica\" (1644) condemning pre-publication censorship is among history's most influential and impassioned defences of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. His desire for freedom extended beyond his philosophy and was reflected in his style, which included his introduction of new words to the English language, coined from Latin and Ancient Greek. He was the first modern writer to employ unrhymed verse outside of the theatre or translations.\nMilton is described as the \"greatest English author\" by his biographer William Hayley, and he remains generally regarded \"as one of the preeminent writers in the English language\", though critical reception has oscillated in the centuries since his death, often on account of his republicanism. Samuel Johnson praised \"Paradise Lost\" as \"a poem which\u00a0... with respect to design may claim the first place, and with respect to performance, the second, among the productions of the human mind\", though he (a Tory) described Milton's politics as those of an \"acrimonious and surly republican\". Milton was revered by poets such as William Blake, William Wordsworth, and Thomas Hardy.\nPhases of Milton's life parallel the major historical and political divisions in Stuart England at the time. In his early years, Milton studied at Christ's College at the University of Cambridge, and then travelled, wrote poetry mostly for private circulation, and launched a career as pamphleteer and publicist under Charles I's increasingly autocratic rule and Britain's breakdown into constitutional confusion and ultimately civil war. He was once considered dangerously radical and heretical, but he contributed to a seismic shift in accepted public opinions during his life that ultimately elevated him to public office in England. The Restoration of 1660 and his loss of vision later deprived Milton of much of his public platform, but he used the period to develop many of his major works.\nMilton's views developed from extensive reading, travel, and experience that began with his days as a student at the University of Cambridge in the 1620s and continued through the English Civil War, which started in 1642 and continued until 1651. By the time of his death in 1674, Milton was impoverished and on the margins of English intellectual life but famous throughout Europe and unrepentant for political choices that placed him at odds with governing authorities.\nJohn Milton is widely regarded as one of the greatest poets in English literature, though his oeuvre has drawn criticism from notable figures, including T. S. Eliot and Joseph Addison. According to some scholars, Milton was second in influence to none but William Shakespeare. In one of his books, Samuel Johnson praised him for having the power of \"displaying the vast, illuminating the splendid, enforcing the awful, darkening the gloomy and aggravating the dreadful\".\nEarly life and education.\nJohn Milton was born in Bread Street, London, on 9 December 1608, the son of composer John Milton and his wife Sarah Jeffrey. The senior John Milton (1562\u20131647) moved to London around 1583 after being disinherited by his devout Catholic father Richard Milton for embracing Protestantism. In London, the senior John Milton married Sarah Jeffrey (1572\u20131637) and found lasting financial success as a scrivener. He lived in and worked from a house in Cheapside at Bread Street, where the Mermaid Tavern was located. The elder Milton was noted for his skill as a composer of music, and this talent left his son with a lifelong appreciation for music and friendships with musicians such as Henry Lawes.\nThe prosperity of Milton's father allowed his eldest son to obtain a private tutor, Thomas Young, a Scottish Presbyterian with an MA from the University of St Andrews. Young's influence also served as the poet's introduction to religious radicalism. After Young's tutorship, Milton attended St Paul's School in London, where he began the study of Latin and Greek; the classical languages left an imprint on both his poetry and prose in English (he also wrote in Latin and Italian).\nMilton's first datable compositions are two psalms written at age 15 at Long Bennington. One contemporary source is \"Brief Lives\" of John Aubrey, an uneven compilation including first-hand reports. In the work, Aubrey quotes Christopher, Milton's younger brother: \"When he was young, he studied very hard and sat up very late, commonly till twelve or one o'clock at night\". Aubrey adds, \"His complexion exceeding faire\u2014he was so faire that they called him the Lady of Christ's College.\"\nIn 1625, Milton gained entry to Christ's College at the University of Cambridge, where he graduated with a BA in 1629, ranking fourth of 24 honours graduates that year in the University of Cambridge. Preparing, at that time, to become an Anglican priest, he stayed on at Cambridge where he received his MA on 3 July 1632.\nMilton may have been rusticated (suspended) in his first year at Cambridge for quarrelling with his tutor, Bishop William Chappell. He was certainly at home in London in the Lent Term 1626; there he wrote \"Elegia Prima\", his first Latin elegy, to Charles Diodati, a friend from St Paul's. Based on remarks of John Aubrey, Chappell \"whipt\" Milton. This story is now disputed, though certainly Milton disliked Chappell. Historian Christopher Hill notes that Milton was apparently rusticated and that the differences between Chappell and Milton may have been either religious or personal. It is also possible that, like Isaac Newton four decades later, Milton was sent home from Cambridge because of the plague, which afflicted Cambridge in 1625.\nAt Cambridge, Milton was on good terms with Edward King; he later dedicated \"Lycidas\" to him. Milton also befriended theologian Roger Williams, tutoring Williams in Hebrew in exchange for lessons in Dutch. Despite developing a reputation for poetic skill and general erudition, Milton suffered from alienation among his peers during his time at Cambridge. Having once watched his fellow students attempting comedy on the college stage, he later observed, \"they thought themselves gallant men, and I thought them fools\".\nMilton also was disdainful of the university curriculum, which consisted of stilted formal debates conducted in Latin on abstruse topics. His own corpus is not devoid of humour, notably his sixth prolusion and his epitaphs on the death of Thomas Hobson. While at Cambridge, he wrote some of his well-known shorter English poems, including \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity\", \"Epitaph on the admirable Dramaticke Poet, W. Shakespeare\" (his first poem to appear in print), \"L'Allegro\", and \"Il Penseroso\".\nStudy, poetry, and travel.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt appears in all his writings that he had the usual concomitant of great abilities, a lofty and steady confidence in himself, perhaps not without some contempt of others; for scarcely any man ever wrote so much, and praised so few. Of his praise he was very frugal; as he set its value high, and considered his mention of a name as a security against the waste of time, and a certain preservative from oblivion.\n\u2014 Samuel Johnson, \"Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets\"\nAfter receiving his MA, Milton moved to Hammersmith, his father's new home since the previous year. He also lived at Horton, Berkshire, from 1635 and undertook six years of self-directed private study. Hill argues that this was not retreating into a rural idyll; Hammersmith was then a \"suburban village\" falling into the orbit of London, and even Horton was becoming deforested and suffered from the plague. He read both ancient and modern works of theology, philosophy, history, politics, literature, and science in preparation for a prospective poetical career. Milton's intellectual development can be charted via entries in his commonplace book (like a scrapbook), now in the British Library. As a result of such intensive study, Milton is considered to be among the most learned of all English poets. In addition to his years of private study, Milton had command of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, Spanish, and Italian from his school and undergraduate days; he also added Old English to his linguistic repertoire in the 1650s while researching his \"History of Britain\", and probably acquired proficiency in Dutch soon after.\nMilton continued to write poetry during this period of study; his \"Arcades\" and \"Comus\" were both commissioned for masques composed for noble patrons, connections of the Egerton family, and performed in 1632 and 1634 respectively. \"Comus\" argues for the virtuousness of temperance and chastity. He contributed his pastoral elegy \"Lycidas\" to a memorial collection for one of his fellow students at Cambridge. Drafts of these poems are preserved in Milton's poetry notebook, known as the Trinity Manuscript, because it is now kept at Trinity College, Cambridge. It was Charles Mason who made the extraordinary discovery, in the library of Trinity College, of \"a packet of thirty loose and tattered folio leaves, almost covered with the handwriting of Milton\". It is thought that Mason recognised the nature of this material around 1735 and the loose-leaf sheets were bound for the first time in 1736; the Trinity Manuscript has been described as \"the chief treasure of Trinity Library\".\nIn May 1638, accompanied by a manservant, Milton embarked upon a tour of France and Italy for 15 months that lasted until July or August 1639. His travels supplemented his study with new and direct experiences of artistic and religious traditions, especially Roman Catholicism. He met famous theorists and intellectuals of the time and was able to display his poetic skills. For specific details of what happened within Milton's \"grand tour\", there appears to be just one primary source: Milton's own \"Defensio Secunda\". There are other records, including some letters and some references in his other prose tracts, but the bulk of the information about the tour comes from a work that, according to Barbara Lewalski, \"was not intended as autobiography but as rhetoric, designed to emphasise his sterling reputation with the learned of Europe.\"\nHe first went to Calais and then on to Paris, riding horseback, with a letter from diplomat Henry Wotton to ambassador John Scudamore. Through Scudamore, Milton met Hugo Grotius, a Dutch law philosopher, playwright, and poet. Milton left France soon after this meeting. He travelled south from Nice to Genoa, and then to Livorno and Pisa. He reached Florence in July 1638. While there, Milton enjoyed many of the sites and structures of the city. His candour of manner and erudite neo-Latin poetry earned him friends in Florentine intellectual circles, and he met the astronomer Galileo who was under house arrest at Arcetri, as well as others. Milton probably visited the Florentine Academy and the Accademia della Crusca along with smaller academies in the area, including the Apatisti and the Svogliati.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn [Florence], which I have always admired above all others because of the elegance, not just of its tongue, but also of its wit, I lingered for about two months. There I at once became the friend of many gentlemen eminent in rank and learning, whose private academies I frequented\u2014a Florentine institution which deserves great praise not only for promoting humane studies but also for encouraging friendly intercourse.\n\u2014 Milton's account of Florence in \"Defensio Secunda\"\nHe left Florence in September to continue to Rome. With the connections from Florence, Milton was able to have easy access to Rome's intellectual society. His poetic abilities impressed those like Giovanni Salzilli, who praised Milton within an epigram. In late October, Milton attended a dinner given by the English College, Rome, despite his dislike for the Society of Jesus, meeting English Catholics who were also guests\u2014theologian Henry Holden and the poet Patrick Cary. He also attended musical events, including oratorios, operas, and melodramas. Milton left for Naples toward the end of November, where he stayed only for a month because of the Spanish control. During that time, he was introduced to Giovanni Battista Manso, patron to both Torquato Tasso and to Giambattista Marino.\nOriginally, Milton wanted to leave Naples in order to travel to Sicily and then on to Greece, but he returned to England during the summer of 1639 because of what he claimed in \"Defensio Secunda\" were \"sad tidings of civil war in England.\" Matters became more complicated when Milton received word that his childhood friend Diodati had died. Milton in fact stayed another seven months on the continent and spent time at Geneva with Diodati's uncle after he returned to Rome. In \"Defensio Secunda\", Milton proclaimed that he was warned against a return to Rome because of his frankness about religion, but he stayed in the city for two months and was able to experience Carnival and meet Lukas Holste, a Vatican librarian who guided Milton through its collection. He was introduced to Cardinal Francesco Barberini who invited Milton to an opera hosted by the Cardinal. Around March, Milton travelled once again to Florence, staying there for two months, attending further meetings of the academies, and spending time with friends. After leaving Florence, he travelled through Lucca, Bologna, and Ferrara before coming to Venice. In Venice, Milton was exposed to a model of Republicanism, later important in his political writings, but he soon found another model when he travelled to Geneva. From Switzerland, Milton travelled to Paris and then to Calais before finally arriving back in England in either July or August 1639.\nCivil war, prose tracts, and marriage.\nOn returning to England where the Bishops' Wars presaged further armed conflict, Milton began to write prose tracts against episcopacy, in the service of the Puritan and Parliamentary cause. Milton's first foray into polemics was \"Of Reformation touching Church Discipline in England\" (1641), followed by \"Of Prelatical Episcopacy\", the two defences of Smectymnuus (a group of Presbyterian divines named from their initials; the \"TY\" belonged to Milton's old tutor Thomas Young), and \"The Reason of Church-Government Urged against Prelaty\". He vigorously attacked the High-church party of the Church of England and their leader William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, with frequent passages of real eloquence lighting up the rough controversial style of the period, and deploying a wide knowledge of church history.\nHe was supported by his father's investments, but Milton became a private schoolmaster at this time, educating his nephews and other children of the well-to-do. This experience and discussions with educational reformer Samuel Hartlib led him to write his short tract \"Of Education\" in 1644, urging a reform of the national universities.\nIn June 1642, Milton paid a visit to the manor house at Forest Hill, Oxfordshire, and, aged 34, married the 17-year-old Mary Powell. The marriage got off to a poor start as Mary did not adapt to Milton's austere lifestyle or get along with his nephews. Milton found her intellectually unsatisfying and disliked the royalist views she had absorbed from her family. It is also speculated that she refused to consummate the marriage. Mary soon returned home to her parents and did not come back until 1645, partly because of the outbreak of the Civil War.\nIn the meantime, her desertion prompted Milton to publish a series of pamphlets over the next three years arguing for the legality and morality of divorce beyond grounds of adultery. (Anna Beer, author of a 2008 biography of Milton, points to a lack of evidence and the dangers of cynicism in urging that it was not necessarily the case that the private life so animated the public polemicising.) In 1643, Milton had a brush with the authorities over these writings, in parallel with Hezekiah Woodward, who had more trouble. It was the hostile response accorded the divorce tracts that spurred Milton to write \"Areopagitica; A speech of Mr. John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicenc'd Printing, to the Parlament of England\", his celebrated attack on pre-printing censorship. In \"Areopagitica\", Milton aligns himself with the parliamentary cause, and he also begins to synthesize the ideal of neo-Roman liberty with that of Christian liberty. Milton also courted another woman during this time; we know nothing of her except that her name was Davis and she turned him down. However, it was enough to induce Mary Powell into returning to him which she did unexpectedly by begging him to take her back. They had two daughters in quick succession following their reconciliation.\nSecretary for Foreign Tongues.\nWith the Parliamentary victory in the Civil War, Milton used his pen in defence of the republican principles represented by the Commonwealth. \"The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates\" (1649) defended the right of the people to hold their rulers to account, and implicitly sanctioned the regicide; Milton's political reputation got him appointed Secretary for Foreign Tongues by the Council of State in March 1649. His main job description was to compose the English Republic's foreign correspondence in Latin and other languages, but he also was called upon to produce propaganda for the regime and to serve as a censor.\nIn October 1649, he published \"Eikonoklastes\", an explicit defence of the regicide, in response to the \"Eikon Basilike\", a phenomenal best-seller popularly attributed to Charles I that portrayed the King as an innocent Christian martyr. A month later the exiled Charles II and his party published the defence of monarchy \"Defensio Regia pro Carolo Primo\", written by leading humanist Claudius Salmasius. By January of the following year, Milton was ordered to write a defence of the English people by the Council of State. Milton worked more slowly than usual, given the European audience and the English Republic's desire to establish diplomatic and cultural legitimacy, as he drew on the learning marshalled by his years of study to compose a riposte.\nOn 24 February 1652, Milton published his Latin defence of the English people \"Defensio pro Populo Anglicano\", also known as the \"First Defence\". Milton's pure Latin prose and evident learning exemplified in the \"First Defence\" quickly made him a European reputation, and the work ran to numerous editions. He addressed his \"Sonnet 16\" to 'The Lord Generall Cromwell in May 1652' beginning \"Cromwell, our chief of men\u00a0...\", although it was not published until 1654.\nIn 1654, Milton completed the second defence of the English nation \"Defensio secunda\" in response to an anonymous Royalist tract \"Regii Sanguinis Clamor ad Coelum Adversus Parricidas Anglicanos\" [The Cry of the Royal Blood to Heaven Against the English Parricides], a work that made many personal attacks on Milton. The second defence praised Oliver Cromwell, now Lord Protector, while exhorting him to remain true to the principles of the Revolution. Alexander Morus, to whom Milton wrongly attributed the \"Clamor\" (in fact by Peter du Moulin), published an attack on Milton, in response to which Milton published the autobiographical \"Defensio pro se\" in 1655. Milton held the appointment of Secretary for Foreign Tongues to the Commonwealth Council of State until 1660, although after he had become totally blind, most of the work was done by his deputies, Georg Rudolph Wecklein, then Philip Meadows, and from 1657 by the poet Andrew Marvell.\nBy 1652, Milton had become totally blind; the cause of his blindness is debated but bilateral retinal detachment or glaucoma are most likely. His blindness forced him to dictate his verse and prose to amanuenses who copied them out for him; one of these was Andrew Marvell. One of his best-known sonnets, \"When I Consider How My Light is Spent,\" titled by a later editor, John Newton, \"On His Blindness,\" is presumed to date from this period.\nThe Restoration.\nCromwell's death in 1658 caused the English Republic to collapse into feuding military and political factions. Milton, however, stubbornly clung to the beliefs that had originally inspired him to write for the Commonwealth. In 1659, he published \"A Treatise of Civil Power\", attacking the concept of a state-dominated church (the position known as Erastianism), as well as \"Considerations touching the likeliest means to remove hirelings\", denouncing corrupt practises in church governance. As the Republic disintegrated, Milton wrote several proposals to retain a non-monarchical government against the wishes of parliament, soldiers, and the people.\nUpon the Restoration in May 1660, Milton, fearing for his life, went into hiding, while a warrant was issued for his arrest and his writings were burnt. He re-emerged after a general pardon was issued, but was nevertheless arrested and briefly imprisoned before influential friends intervened, such as Marvell, now an MP. Milton married for a third and final time on 24 February 1663, marrying Elizabeth (Betty) Minshull, aged 24, a native of Wistaston, Cheshire. He spent the remaining decade of his life living quietly in London, only retiring to a cottage during the Great Plague of London\u2014Milton's Cottage in Chalfont St. Giles, his only extant home.\nDuring this period, Milton published several minor prose works, such as the grammar textbook \"Art of Logic\" and a \"History of Britain\". His only explicitly political tracts were the 1672 \"Of True Religion\", arguing for toleration (except for Catholics), and a translation of a Polish tract advocating an elective monarchy. Both these works were referred to in the Exclusion debate, the attempt to exclude the heir presumptive from the throne of England\u2014James, Duke of York\u2014because he was Roman Catholic. That debate preoccupied politics in the 1670s and 1680s and precipitated the formation of the Whig party and the Glorious Revolution.\nDeath.\nMilton died on 8 November 1674, just a month before his 66th birthday. He was buried in the church of St Giles-without-Cripplegate, Fore Street, London. However, sources differ as to whether the cause of death was consumption or gout. According to an early biographer, his funeral was attended by \"his learned and great Friends in London, not without a friendly concourse of the Vulgar.\" A monument was added in 1737 on Westminster Abbey in London, UK.\nFamily.\nMilton and his first wife Mary Powell (1625\u20131652) had four children:\nMary Powell died on 5 May 1652 from complications following Deborah's birth. Milton's daughters survived to adulthood, but he always had a strained relationship with them.\nOn 12 November 1656, Milton was married to Katherine Woodcock at St Margaret's, Westminster. She died on 3 February 1658, less than four months after giving birth to her daughter Katherine, who also died.\nMilton married for a third time on 24 February 1663 to Elizabeth Mynshull or Minshull (1638\u20131728), the niece of Thomas Mynshull, a wealthy apothecary and philanthropist in Manchester. The marriage took place at St Mary Aldermary in the City of London. Despite a 30-year age gap, the marriage seemed happy, according to John Aubrey, and lasted more than 12 years until Milton's death. (A plaque on the wall of Mynshull's House in Manchester describes Elizabeth as Milton's \"3rd and Best wife\".) Samuel Johnson, however, claims that Mynshull was \"a domestic companion and attendant\" and Milton's nephew Edward Phillips relates that Mynshull \"oppressed his children in his lifetime, and cheated them at his death\".\nHis nephews, Edward and John Phillips (sons of Milton's sister Anne), were educated by Milton and became writers themselves. John acted as a secretary, and Edward was Milton's first biographer.\nPoetry.\nMilton's poetry was slow to see the light of day, at least under his name. His first published poem was \"On Shakespeare\" (1630), anonymously included in the Second Folio edition of William Shakespeare's plays in 1632. An annotated copy of the First Folio has been suggested to contain marginal notes by Milton. Milton collected his work in \"1645 Poems\" in the midst of the excitement attending the possibility of establishing a new English government. The anonymous edition of \"Comus\" was published in 1637, and the publication of \"Lycidas\" in 1638 in \"Justa Edouardo King Naufrago\" was signed J. M. Otherwise. The 1645 collection was the only poetry of his to see print until \"Paradise Lost\" appeared in 1667.\n\"Paradise Lost\".\nMilton's \"magnum opus\", the blank-verse epic poem \"Paradise Lost\", was composed by the blind and impoverished Milton from 1658 to 1664 (first edition), with small but significant revisions published in 1674 (second edition). As a blind poet, Milton dictated his verse to a series of aides in his employ. It has been argued that the poem reflects his personal despair at the failure of the Revolution yet affirms an ultimate optimism in human potential. Some literary critics have argued that Milton encoded many references to his unyielding support for the \"Good Old Cause\".\nOn 27 April 1667, Milton sold the publication rights for \"Paradise Lost\" to publisher Samuel Simmons for \u00a35 (equivalent to approximately \u00a3770 in 2015 purchasing power), with a further \u00a35 to be paid if and when each print run sold out of between 1,300 and 1,500 copies. The first run was a quarto edition priced at three shillings per copy (about \u00a323 in 2015 purchasing power equivalent), published in August 1667, and it sold out in eighteen months.\nMilton followed up the publication \"Paradise Lost\" with its sequel \"Paradise Regained\", which was published alongside the tragedy \"Samson Agonistes\" in 1671. Both of these works also reflect Milton's post-Restoration political situation. Just before his death in 1674, Milton supervised a second edition of \"Paradise Lost\", accompanied by an explanation of \"why the poem rhymes not\", and prefatory verses by Andrew Marvell. In 1673, Milton republished his \"1645 Poems\", as well as a collection of his letters and the Latin prolusions from his Cambridge days.\nViews.\nAn unfinished religious manifesto, , probably written by Milton, lays out many of his heterodox theological views, and was not discovered and published until 1823. Milton's key beliefs were idiosyncratic, not those of an identifiable group or faction, and often they go well beyond the orthodoxy of the time. Their tone, however, stemmed from the Puritan emphasis on the centrality and inviolability of conscience. He was his own man, but he was anticipated by Henry Robinson in \"Areopagitica\".\nPhilosophy.\nWhile Milton's beliefs are generally considered to be consistent with Protestant Christianity, Stephen M. Fallon argues that by the late 1650s, Milton may have at least toyed with the idea of monism or animist materialism, the notion that a single material substance which is \"animate, self-active, and free\" composes everything in the universe: from stones and trees and bodies to minds, souls, angels, and God. Fallon claims that Milton devised this position to avoid the mind-body dualism of Plato and Descartes as well as the mechanistic determinism of Hobbes. According to Fallon, Milton's monism is most notably reflected in \"Paradise Lost\" when he has angels eat (5.433\u2013439) and apparently engage in sexual intercourse (8.622\u2013629) and the \"De Doctrina\", where he denies the dual natures of man and argues for a theory of Creation \"ex Deo\".\nPolitical thought.\nMilton was a \"passionately individual Christian Humanist poet.\" He appears on the pages of seventeenth-century English Puritanism, an age characterized as \"the world turned upside down.\" He was a Puritan and yet was unwilling to surrender conscience to party positions on public policy. Thus, Milton's political thought, driven by competing convictions, a Reformed faith and a Humanist spirit, led to enigmatic outcomes.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Milton's apparently contradictory stance on the vital problems of his age, arose from religious contestations to the questions of the divine rights of kings. In both cases, he seems in control, taking stock of the situation arising from the polarization of the English society on religious and political lines. He fought with the Puritans against the Cavaliers i.e. the King's party, and helped win the day. But the very same constitutional and republican polity, when tried to curtail freedom of speech, Milton, given his humanistic zeal, wrote \"Areopagitica\" . . . [\"sic\"] \"Areopagitica\" was written in response to the Licensing Order, in November 1644.\nMilton's political thought may be best categorized according to respective periods in his life and times. The years 1641\u201342 were dedicated to church politics and the struggle against episcopacy. After his divorce writings, \"Areopagitica\", and a gap, he wrote in 1649\u201354 in the aftermath of the execution of Charles I, and in polemic justification of the regicide and the existing Parliamentarian regime. Then in 1659\u201360 he foresaw the Restoration and wrote to head it off.\nMilton's own beliefs were in some cases unpopular, particularly his commitment to republicanism. In the coming centuries, Milton would be claimed as an early apostle of liberalism. According to James Tully:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... with Locke as with Milton, republican and contraction conceptions of political freedom join hands in common opposition to the disengaged and passive subjection offered by absolutists such as Hobbes and Robert Filmer.\nA friend and ally in the pamphlet wars was Marchamont Nedham. Austin Woolrych considers that although they were quite close, there is \"little real affinity, beyond a broad republicanism\", between their approaches. Blair Worden remarks that both Milton and Nedham, with others such as Andrew Marvell and James Harrington, would have taken their problem with the Rump Parliament to be not the republic itself, but the fact that it was not a proper republic. Woolrych speaks of \"the gulf between Milton's vision of the Commonwealth's future and the reality\". In the early version of his \"History of Britain\", begun in 1649, Milton was already writing off the members of the Long Parliament as incorrigible.\nHe praised Oliver Cromwell as the Protectorate was set up; though subsequently he had major reservations. When Cromwell seemed to be backsliding as a revolutionary, after a couple of years in power, Milton moved closer to the position of Sir Henry Vane, to whom he wrote a sonnet in 1652. The group of disaffected republicans included, besides Vane, John Bradshaw, John Hutchinson, Edmund Ludlow, Henry Marten, Robert Overton, Edward Sexby and John Streater; but not Marvell, who remained with Cromwell's party. Milton had already commended Overton, along with Edmund Whalley and Bulstrode Whitelocke, in \"Defensio Secunda\". Nigel Smith writes that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... John Streater, and the form of republicanism he stood for, was a fulfilment of Milton's most optimistic ideas of free speech and of public heroism [...]\nAs Richard Cromwell fell from power, he envisaged a step towards a freer republic or \"free commonwealth\", writing in the hope of this outcome in early 1660. Milton had argued for an awkward position, in the \"Ready and Easy Way\", because he wanted to invoke the Good Old Cause and gain the support of the republicans, but without offering a democratic solution of any kind. His proposal, backed by reference (amongst other reasons) to the oligarchical Dutch and Venetian constitutions, was for a council with perpetual membership. This attitude cut right across the grain of popular opinion of the time, which swung decisively behind the restoration of the Stuart monarchy that took place later in the year. Milton, an associate of and advocate on behalf of the regicides, was silenced on political matters as Charles II returned.\nTheology.\nJohn Milton was neither a clergyman nor a theologian; however, theology, and particularly English Calvinism, formed the palette on which he created his greatest thoughts. Milton wrestled with the great doctrines of the Church amidst the theological crosswinds of his age. The great poet was undoubtedly Reformed (though his grandfather, Richard \"the Ranger\" Milton had been Roman Catholic). However, Milton's Calvinism had to find expression in a broad-spirited Humanism. Like many Renaissance artists before him, Milton attempted to integrate Christian theology with classical modes. In his early poems, the poet narrator expresses a tension between vice and virtue, the latter invariably related to Protestantism. In \"Comus\", Milton may make ironic use of the Caroline court masque by elevating notions of purity and virtue over the conventions of court revelry and superstition. In his later poems, Milton's theological concerns become more explicit.\nHis use of biblical citation was wide-ranging; Harris Fletcher, standing at the beginning of the intensification of the study of the use of scripture in Milton's work (poetry and prose, in all languages Milton mastered), notes that typically Milton clipped and adapted biblical quotations to suit the purpose, giving precise chapter and verse only in texts for a more specialized readership. As for the plenitude of Milton's quotations from scripture, Fletcher comments, \"For this work, I have in all actually collated about twenty-five hundred of the five to ten thousand direct Biblical quotations which appear therein\". Milton's customary English Bible was the Authorized King James. When citing and writing in other languages, he usually employed the Latin translation by Immanuel Tremellius, though \"he was equipped to read the Bible in Latin, in Greek, and in Hebrew, including the Targumim or Aramaic paraphrases of the Old Testament, and the Syriac version of the New, together with the available commentaries of those several versions\".\nMilton embraced many heterodox Christian theological views. He has been accused of rejecting the Trinity, believing instead that the Son was subordinate to the Father, a position known as Arianism; and his sympathy or curiosity was probably engaged by Socinianism: in August 1650 he licensed for publication by William Dugard the \"Racovian Catechism\", based on a non-trinitarian creed. Milton's alleged Arianism, like much of his theology, is still the subject of debate and controversy. Rufus Wilmot Griswold argued that \"In none of his great works is there a passage from which it can be inferred that he was an Arian; and in the very last of his writings he declares that \"the doctrine of the Trinity is a plain doctrine in Scripture.\" In \"Areopagitica,\" Milton classified Arians and Socinians as \"errorists\" and \"schismatics\" alongside Arminians and Anabaptists. A source has interpreted him as broadly Protestant, if not always easy to locate in a more precise religious category. In 2019, John Rogers stated, \"Heretics both, John Milton and Isaac Newton were, as most scholars now agree, Arians.\"\nIn his 1641 treatise, \"Of Reformation\", Milton expressed his dislike for Catholicism and episcopacy, presenting Rome as a modern Babylon, and bishops as Egyptian taskmasters. These analogies conform to Milton's puritanical preference for Old Testament imagery. He knew at least four commentaries on \"Genesis\": those of John Calvin, Paulus Fagius, David Pareus and Andreus Rivetus.\nThrough the Interregnum, Milton often presents England, rescued from the trappings of a worldly monarchy, as an elect nation akin to the Old Testament Israel, and shows its leader, Oliver Cromwell, as a latter-day Moses. These views were bound up in Protestant views of the Millennium, which some sects, such as the Fifth Monarchists predicted would arrive in England. Milton, however, would later criticise the \"worldly\" millenarian views of these and others, and expressed orthodox ideas on the prophecy of the Four Empires.\nThe Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 began a new phase in Milton's work. In \"Paradise Lost\", \"Paradise Regained\" and \"Samson Agonistes\", Milton mourns the end of the godly Commonwealth. The Garden of Eden may allegorically reflect Milton's view of England's recent Fall from Grace, while Samson's blindness and captivity\u2014mirroring Milton's own lost sight\u2014may be a metaphor for England's blind acceptance of Charles II as king. Illustrated by \"Paradise Lost\" is mortalism, the belief that the soul lies dormant after the body dies.\nDespite the Restoration of the monarchy, Milton did not lose his personal faith; \"Samson\" shows how the loss of national salvation did not necessarily preclude the salvation of the individual, while \"Paradise Regained\" expresses Milton's continuing belief in the promise of Christian salvation through Jesus Christ.\nThough he maintained his personal faith in spite of the defeats suffered by his cause, the \"Dictionary of National Biography\" recounted how he had been alienated from the Church of England by Archbishop William Laud, and then moved similarly from the Dissenters by their denunciation of religious tolerance in England.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Milton had come to stand apart from all sects, though apparently finding the Quakers most congenial. He never went to any religious services in his later years. When a servant brought back accounts of sermons from nonconformist meetings, Milton became so sarcastic that the man at last gave up his place.Writing of the enigmatic and often conflicting views of Milton in the Puritan age, David Daiches wrote,&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A fair theological summary may be that John Milton was a Puritan, though his tendency to press further for liberty of conscience, sometimes out of conviction and often out of mere intellectual curiosity, made the great man, at least, a vital if not uncomfortable ally in the broader Puritan movement.\nReligious toleration.\nMilton called in the \"Areopagitica\" for \"the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties\" to the conflicting Protestant denominations. According to American historian William Hunter, \"Milton argued for disestablishment as the only effective way of achieving broad toleration. Rather than force a man's conscience, government should recognise the persuasive force of the gospel.\"\nDivorce.\nMilton wrote \"The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce\" in 1643, at the beginning of the English Civil War. In August of that year, he presented his thoughts to the Westminster Assembly of Divines, which had been created by the Long Parliament to bring greater reform to the Church of England. The Assembly convened on 1 July against the will of King Charles I.\nMilton's thinking on divorce caused him considerable trouble with the authorities. An orthodox Presbyterian view of the time was that Milton's views on divorce constituted a one-man heresy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The fervently Presbyterian Edwards had included Milton's divorce tracts in his list in \"Gangraena\" of heretical publications that threatened the religious and moral fabric of the nation; Milton responded by mocking him as \"shallow Edwards\" in the satirical sonnet \"On the New Forcers of Conscience under the Long Parliament\", usually dated to the latter half of 1646.\nEven here, though, his originality is qualified: Thomas Gataker had already identified \"mutual solace\" as a principal goal in marriage. Milton abandoned his campaign to legitimise divorce after 1645, but he expressed support for polygamy in the , the theological treatise that provides the clearest evidence for his views.\nMilton wrote during a period when thoughts about divorce were anything but simplistic; rather, there was active debate among thinkers and intellectuals at the time. However, Milton's basic approval of divorce within strict parameters set by the biblical witness was typical of many influential Christian intellectuals, particularly the Westminster divines. Milton addressed the Assembly on the matter of divorce in August 1643, at a moment when the Assembly was beginning to form its opinion on the matter. In the \"Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce\", Milton argued that divorce was a private matter, not a legal or ecclesiastical one. Neither the Assembly nor Parliament condemned Milton or his ideas. In fact, when the Westminster Assembly wrote the Westminster Confession of Faith they allowed for divorce ('Of Marriage and Divorce,' Chapter 24, Section 5) in cases of infidelity or abandonment. Thus, the Christian community, at least a majority within the 'Puritan' sub-set, approved of Milton's views.\nNevertheless, the reaction among Puritans to Milton's views on divorce was mixed. Herbert Palmer, a member of the Westminster Assembly, condemned Milton in the strongest possible language:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If any plead Conscience ... for divorce for other causes than Christ and His Apostles mention; Of which a wicked booke is abroad and uncensured, though deserving to be burnt, whose Author, hath been so impudent as to set his Name to it, and dedicate it to your selves ... will you grant a Toleration for all this?\u2014\u200a\nPalmer expressed his disapproval in a sermon addressed to the Westminster Assembly. The Scottish commissioner Robert Baillie described Palmer's sermon as one \"of the most Scottish and free sermons that ever I heard anywhere\".\nHistory.\nHistory was particularly important for the political class of the period, and Lewalski considers that Milton \"more than most illustrates\" a remark of Thomas Hobbes on the weight placed at the time on the classical Latin historical writers Tacitus, Livy, Sallust and Cicero, and their republican attitudes. Milton himself wrote that \"Worthy deeds are not often destitute of worthy relaters\", in Book II of his \"History of Britain\". A sense of history mattered greatly to him:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The course of human history, the immediate impact of the civil disorders, and his own traumatic personal life, are all regarded by Milton as typical of the predicament he describes as \"the misery that has bin since Adam\".\nLegacy and influence.\nOnce \"Paradise Lost\" was published, Milton's stature as an epic poet was immediately recognised. He cast a formidable shadow over English poetry in the 18th and 19th centuries; he was often judged equal or superior to all other English poets, including Shakespeare. Very early on, though, he was championed by Whigs, and decried by Tories: with the regicide Edmund Ludlow he was claimed as an early Whig, while the High Tory Anglican minister Luke Milbourne lumped Milton in with other \"Agents of Darkness\" such as John Knox, George Buchanan, Richard Baxter, Algernon Sidney and John Locke. The political ideas of Milton, Locke, Sidney, and James Harrington strongly influenced the Radical Whigs, whose ideology in turn was central to the American Revolution. Modern scholars of Milton's life, politics, and work are known as Miltonists: \"his work is the subject of a very large amount of academic scholarship\".\nIn 2008, John Milton Passage, a short passage by Bread Street into St Mary-le-Bow Churchyard in London, was unveiled.\nEarly reception of the poetry.\nJohn Dryden, an early enthusiast, in 1677 began the trend of describing Milton as the poet of the sublime. Dryden's \"The State of Innocence and the Fall of Man: an Opera\" (1677) is evidence of an immediate cultural influence. In 1695, Patrick Hume became the first editor of \"Paradise Lost\", providing an extensive apparatus of annotation and commentary, particularly chasing down allusions.\nIn 1732, the classical scholar Richard Bentley offered a corrected version of \"Paradise Lost\". Bentley was considered presumptuous and was attacked in the following year by Zachary Pearce. Christopher Ricks judges that, as a critic, Bentley was both acute and wrong-headed, and \"incorrigibly eccentric\"; William Empson also finds Pearce to be more sympathetic to Bentley's underlying line of thought than is warranted.\nThere was an early, partial translation of \"Paradise Lost\" into German by Theodore Haak and based on that a standard verse translation by Ernest Gottlieb von Berge. A subsequent prose translation by Johann Jakob Bodmer was very popular; it influenced Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. The German-language Milton tradition returned to England in the person of the artist Henry Fuseli.\nMany Enlightenment thinkers of the 18th century revered and commented on Milton's poetry and non-poetical works. In addition to John Dryden, among them were Alexander Pope, Joseph Addison, Thomas Newton, and Samuel Johnson. For example, in \"The Spectator\", Joseph Addison wrote extensive notes, annotations, and interpretations of certain passages of \"Paradise Lost\". Jonathan Richardson, senior, and Jonathan Richardson, the younger, co-wrote a book of criticism. In 1749, Thomas Newton published an extensive edition of Milton's poetical works with annotations provided by himself, Dryden, Pope, Addison, the Richardsons (father and son) and others. Newton's edition of Milton was a culmination of the honour bestowed upon Milton by early Enlightenment thinkers; it may also have been prompted by Richard Bentley's infamous edition, described above. Samuel Johnson wrote numerous essays on \"Paradise Lost\", and Milton was included in his \"Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets\" (1779\u20131781). In \"The Age of Louis XIV\", Voltaire said \"Milton remains the glory and the wonder (\"l'admiration\") of England.\"\nWilliam Blake.\nWilliam Blake considered Milton the major English poet. Blake placed Edmund Spenser as Milton's precursor, and saw himself as Milton's poetical son. In his \"\", Blake uses Milton as a spiritual guide and a symbol of poetic inspiration.\nRomantic theory.\nEdmund Burke was a theorist of the sublime, and he regarded Milton's description of Hell as exemplary of sublimity as an aesthetic concept. For Burke, it was to set alongside mountaintops, a storm at sea, and infinity. In \"The Beautiful and the Sublime\", he wrote: \"No person seems better to have understood the secret of heightening, or of setting terrible things, if I may use the expression, in their strongest light, by the force of a judicious obscurity than Milton.\"\nThe Romantic poets valued his exploration of blank verse, but for the most part rejected his religiosity. William Wordsworth began his sonnet \"London, 1802\" with \"Milton! thou should'st be living at this hour\" and modelled \"The Prelude\", his own blank verse epic, on \"Paradise Lost\". John Keats found the yoke of Milton's style uncongenial; he exclaimed that \"Miltonic verse cannot be written but in an artful or rather artist's humour.\" Keats felt that \"Paradise Lost\" was a \"beautiful and grand curiosity\", but his own unfinished attempt at epic poetry, \"Hyperion\", was unsatisfactory to the author because, amongst other things, it had too many \"Miltonic inversions\". In \"The Madwoman in the Attic\", Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar note that Mary Shelley's novel \"Frankenstein\" is, in the view of many critics, \"one of the key 'Romantic' readings of \"Paradise Lost\".\"\nLater legacy.\nThe Victorian age witnessed a continuation of Milton's influence. Thomas Carlyle declared him the \"moral king of English literature,\" while George Eliot and Thomas Hardy were particularly inspired by Milton's poetry and biography. Hostile 20th-century criticism by T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound did not reduce Milton's stature. F. R. Leavis, in \"The Common Pursuit\", responded to the points made by Eliot, in particular the claim that \"the study of Milton could be of no help: it was only a hindrance\", by arguing, \"As if it were a matter of deciding \"not\" to study Milton! The problem, rather, was to escape from an influence that was so difficult to escape from because it was unrecognized, belonging, as it did, to the climate of the habitual and 'natural'.\" Harold Bloom, in \"The Anxiety of Influence\", wrote that \"Milton is the central problem in any theory and history of poetic influence in English [...]\".\nMilton's \"Areopagitica\" is still cited as relevant to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. A quotation from \"Areopagitica\"\u2014\"A good book is the precious lifeblood of a master spirit, embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life\"\u2014is displayed in many public libraries, including the New York Public Library.\nThe title of Philip Pullman's \"His Dark Materials\" trilogy is derived from a quotation, \"His dark materials to create more worlds\", line 915 of Book II in \"Paradise Lost\". Pullman was concerned to produce a version of Milton's poem accessible to teenagers, and has spoken of Milton as \"our greatest public poet\".\nTitles of a number of other well-known literary works are also derived from Milton's writings. Examples include Thomas Wolfe's \"Look Homeward, Angel\", Aldous Huxley's \"Eyeless in Gaza\", Arthur Koestler's \"Darkness at Noon\", and William Golding's \"Darkness Visible\".\nT. S. Eliot believed that \"of no other poet is it so difficult to consider the poetry simply as poetry, without our theological and political dispositions\u00a0... making unlawful entry\".\nLiterary legacy.\nMilton's use of blank verse, in addition to his stylistic innovations (such as grandiloquence of voice and vision, peculiar diction and phraseology) influenced later poets. At the time, poetic blank verse was considered distinct from its use in verse drama, and \"Paradise Lost\" was taken as a unique exemplar. Said Isaac Watts in 1734, \"Mr. Milton is esteemed the parent and author of blank verse among us\". \"Miltonic verse\" might be synonymous for a century with blank verse as poetry, a new poetic terrain independent from both the drama and the heroic couplet.\nLack of rhyme was sometimes taken as Milton's defining innovation. He himself considered the rhymeless quality of \"Paradise Lost\" to be an extension of his own personal liberty:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This neglect then of Rhime\u00a0... is to be esteem'd an example set, the first in English, of ancient liberty recover'd to heroic Poem from the troublesom and modern bondage of Rimeing.\nThis pursuit of freedom was largely a reaction against conservative values entrenched within the rigid heroic couplet. Within a dominant culture that stressed elegance and finish, he granted primacy to freedom, breadth and imaginative suggestiveness, eventually developed into the romantic vision of sublime terror. Reaction to Milton's poetic worldview included, grudgingly, acknowledgement of the poet's resemblance to classical writers (Greek and Roman poetry being unrhymed). Blank verse came to be a recognised medium for religious works and for translations of the classics. Unrhymed lyrics like Collins' \"Ode to Evening\" (in the meter of Milton's translation of Horace's \"Ode to Pyrrha\") were not uncommon after 1740.\nA second aspect of Milton's blank verse was the use of unconventional rhythm:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;His blank-verse paragraph, and his audacious and victorious attempt to combine blank and rhymed verse with paragraphic effect in Lycidas, lay down indestructible models and patterns of English verse-rhythm, as distinguished from the narrower and more strait-laced forms of English metre.\nBefore Milton, \"the sense of regular rhythm\u00a0... had been knocked into the English head so securely that it was part of their nature\". The \"Heroick measure\", according to Samuel Johnson, \"is pure\u00a0... when the accent rests upon every second syllable through the whole line\u00a0... The repetition of this sound or percussion at equal times, is the most complete harmony of which a single verse is capable\". Caesural pauses, most agreed, were best placed at the middle and the end of the line. In order to support this symmetry, lines were most often octo- or deca-syllabic, with no enjambed endings. To this schema Milton introduced modifications, which included hypermetrical syllables (trisyllabic feet), inversion or slighting of stresses, and the shifting of pauses to all parts of the line. Milton deemed these features to be reflective of \"the transcendental union of order and freedom\". Admirers remained hesitant to adopt such departures from traditional metrical schemes: \"The English\u00a0... had been writing separate lines for so long that they could not rid themselves of the habit\". Isaac Watts preferred his lines distinct from each other, as did Oliver Goldsmith, Henry Pemberton, and Scott of Amwell, whose general opinion it was that Milton's frequent omission of the initial unaccented foot was \"displeasing to a nice ear\". It was not until the late 18th century that poets (beginning with Gray) began to appreciate \"the composition of Milton's harmony\u00a0... how he loved to vary his pauses, his measures, and his feet, which gives that enchanting air of freedom and wilderness to his versification\". By the 20th century, American poet and critic John Hollander would go so far as to say that Milton \"was able, by plying that most remarkable instrument of English meter ... to invent a new mode of image-making in English poetry.\"\nMilton's pursuit of liberty extended into his vocabulary as well. It included many Latinate neologisms, as well as obsolete words already dropped from popular usage so completely that their meanings were no longer understood. In 1740, Francis Peck identified some examples of Milton's \"old\" words (now popular). The \"Miltonian dialect\", as it was called, was emulated by later poets; Pope used the diction of \"Paradise Lost\" in his Homer translation, while the lyric poetry of Gray and Collins was frequently criticised for their use of \"obsolete words out of Spenser and Milton\". The language of Thomson's finest poems (e.g. \"The Seasons\", \"The Castle of Indolence\") was self-consciously modelled after the Miltonian dialect, with the same tone and sensibilities as \"Paradise Lost\". Following to Milton, English poetry from Pope to John Keats exhibited a steadily increasing attention to the connotative, the imaginative and poetic, value of words.\nMusical settings.\nMilton's ode \"At a solemn Musick\" was set for choir and orchestra as \"Blest Pair of Sirens\" by Hubert Parry (1848\u20131918), and Milton's poem \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity\" was set as a large-scale choral work by Cyril Rootham (1875\u20131938). Milton also wrote the hymn Let us with a gladsome mind, a versification of Psalm 136. His 'L'Allegro' and 'Il Penseroso', with additional material, were magnificently set by Handel (1740).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Among the notable films he directed or co-directed are \"A Tale of the Wind\", \"The Spanish Earth\", \"Rain\", \"...A Valparaiso\", \"Mis\u00e8re au Borinage\" (\"Borinage\"), \"\", \"The Seine Meets Paris\", \"Far from Vietnam\", \"Pour le Mistral\" and \"How Yukong Moved the Mountains\".\nEarly life and education.\nBorn Georg Henri Anton Ivens on 18 November 1898 at Nijmegen, Netherlands, into a wealthy family, Ivens went to work in one of his father's photo supply shops and from there developed an interest in film. Under the direction of his father, he completed his first film at the age of 13: a silent short titled \"Wigwam (Shining Ray)\".\nHe studied first at the Rotterdam School of Economics (1916\u201317, 1920\u201321), before serving as a field artillery lieutenant in World War I. In 1922 and 1923 he studied photochemistry in Germany.\nReturning to Amsterdam in 1926, he joined the family business, but left around 1929 after his first two films were met with acclaim.\nCareer.\nEarly work.\nOriginally his work was constructivist in character, especially his short city symphonies \"Rain\" (\"Regen\", 1929), which he directed together with Mannus Franken, filmed over two years, and \"The Bridge\" (\"De Brug\", 1928). The latter was about a newly built elevator railway bridge in Rotterdam, shot in 1927, and shown in 1928 by the (Netherlands Film League) (1927\u20131933). This avant-garde cineclub, with its eponymous magazine, had just been established by Ivens, Menno ter Braak, and others, with branches in different Dutch cities. \"The Bridge\" was part of its first season of film screenings, and received critical acclaim. The \"Filmliga\" drew various foreign filmmakers to the Netherlands, such as Alberto Cavalcanti, Ren\u00e9 Clair, Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and Dziga Vertov, who also became Ivens' friends. Through these connections, \"The Bridge\" was widely shown abroad, including the Soviet Union.\nIn 1929, Ivens went to the Soviet Union after being invited to present a lecture there, and due to the success of \"The Bridge\", he was invited to direct a film on a topic of his own choosing, which was the new industrial city of Magnitogorsk. Before commencing work, he returned to the Netherlands to make \"Industrial Symphony\" for Philips Electric, which is considered to be a film of great technical beauty. \nHe returned to the Soviet Union to make the film about Magnitogorsk, \"Song of Heroes \" in 1931 with music composed by Hanns Eisler. This was the first film on which Ivens and Eisler worked together. It was a propaganda film about this new industrial city where masses of laborers and Communist youth worked for Stalin's Five Year Plan.\nWith Henri Storck, Ivens made \"Mis\u00e8re au Borinage\" (\"Borinage\", 1933), a documentary on life in a coal mining region. In 1943, he also directed two Allied propaganda films for the National Film Board of Canada, including \"Action Stations\", about the Royal Canadian Navy's escorting of convoys in the Battle of the Atlantic.\nIvens met Ernest Hemingway and Ludwig Renn during the Spanish Civil War.\nU.S. and World War II.\nFrom 1936 to 1945, Ivens was based in the United States. For Pare Lorentz's U.S. Film Service, in the year 1940, he made the documentary film \"Power and the Land\", on rural electrification and Franklin Roosevelt's electrification program. It focuses on a family, the Parkinsons, who run a business providing milk for their community. The film highlights the differences in their lifestyle before and after the advent of electricity.\nIvens was, however, better known for his anti-fascist and other propaganda films, including the feature-length documentary \"The Spanish Earth\" (1937). This film was made for the Spanish Republican cause, co-written with Hemingway, with music by Marc Blitzstein and Virgil Thomson. Jean Renoir did the French narration for the film and Hemingway did the English version (after Orson Welles' version had sounded too theatrical). This film was financed by Archibald MacLeish, Fredric March, Florence Eldridge, Lillian Hellman, Luise Rainer, Dudley Nichols, Franchot Tone, and other Hollywood movie stars, moguls, and writers who composed a group known as the Contemporary Historians. \" The Spanish Earth \" was shown at the White House on 8 July 1937 after Ivens, Hemingway, and Martha Gellhorn had had dinner with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Harry Hopkins. According to Hemingway, the Roosevelts were \"very moved\" by the film, but said that \"we should put more propaganda in it\". The film showed how the Republicans tried to hold on to freedoms which were threatened by the Falangists, and their attempts to reclaim farmland which had been neglected for decades by absentee landlords. Ivens produced the film for less than $10,000. This documentary was considered his masterpiece.\nIn 1938 he traveled to China. \"The 400 Million\" (1939) depicted the history of modern China and the Chinese resistance during the Second Sino-Japanese War, including dramatic shots of the Battle of Taierzhuang. Robert Capa did camerawork, Sidney Lumet worked on the film as a reader, Hanns Eisler wrote the musical score, and Fredric March provided the narration. It had been financed by the same people who had supported \"Spanish Earth\". Its chief fundraiser was Luise Rainer, recipient of the best actress Oscar two years in a row; and the entire group called themselves this time, \"History Today, Inc \". The Kuomintang government censored the film, fearing that it would give too much credit to left-wing forces. Ivens was also suspected of being a friend of Mao Zedong and especially Zhou Enlai.\nIn early 1943, Frank Capra hired Ivens to supervise the production of \"Know Your Enemy: Japan \" for his U.S. War Department film series \"Why We Fight\". The film's commentary was written largely by Carl Foreman. Capra fired Ivens from the project because he felt that his approach was too sympathetic toward the Japanese. The film's release was held up because there were concerns that emperor Hirohito was being depicted as a war criminal, and there was a policy shift to portray the emperor more favorably after the war as a means of maintaining order in post-war Japan.\nWith the emerging \"Red Scare\" of the late 1940s, Ivens was forced to leave the country in the early months of the Truman administration. Ivens's leftist politics also put a stop to his first feature film project, which was to have starred Greta Garbo. Walter Wanger, the film's producer, was adamant about \"running [Ivens] out of town.\"\nReturn to Europe.\nIn 1946, commissioned to make a Dutch film about Indonesian independence, Ivens resigned in protest over what he considered ongoing imperialism; the Dutch were in his view resisting decolonization. Instead, Ivens filmed \"Indonesia Calling\" in secret, for which he received funding from the International Workers Order. \nFor around a decade Ivens lived in Eastern Europe, working for several studios in Czechoslovakia, Poland and East Germany.\nHaving been criticized in the Netherlands, the tides were turning in the 1960s. In 1965, the city of Rotterdam commissioned him to make a film about the port, which was meant to be a promotional film, but Ivens got \"carte blanche\". The result, the essay-film \"Rotterdam Europoort\" (1966), is not only critical of modern city planning and consumerism, but also an autobiographical tale inspired by the legend of the Flying Dutchman. Ivens was very happy with the result and even believed that it was his best film. \nIvens worked on two documentary films about North Vietnam during the war; he made \"\" \"(17th Parallel: Vietnam in War)\" in 1968. Xu\u00e2n Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng was assigned as the interpreter and host to him and his wife while they directed the film about the effect of bombing on Vietnam. Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng said that she remembered a comment by Ivens where he hoped that she would make a good life. This led her to turn away from her career path which was heading to be a deputy minister. She decided instead to become a war correspondent and in time a TV director. \nHe later participated in the collective work \"Loin du Vietnam\" (\"Far from Vietnam\").\nFrom 1971 to 1977, he shot \"How Yukong Moved the Mountains\", a 763-minute documentary about the Cultural Revolution in China.\nShortly before his death in 1989, Ivens released the last of more than 40 films: \"Une histoire de vent\" (\"A Tale of the Wind\").\nRecognition and awards.\nIvens was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize for the year 1967.\nIn 1988 he received the Golden Lion Honorary Award at the Venice Film Festival.\nHe received a knighthood in the Order of the Netherlands Lion in January 1989.\nPersonal life.\nIvens met photographer Germaine Krull in Berlin in 1923, and entered into a marriage of convenience with her between 1927 and 1943 so that Krull could hold a Dutch passport and could have a \"veneer of married respectability without sacrificing her autonomy.\"\nIvens later married French filmmaker and writer Marceline Loridan. They had no children.\nDeath and legacy.\nOn 7 June 1989 Ivens spoke to Radio Netherlands about his life and work in a wide-ranging interview.\nHe died on 28 June 1989. He was buried at the Cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse in Paris.\nThe Joris Ivens Award was awarded at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam from 1988, before being renamed the IDFA Award for Best Feature-Length Documentary between 2006 and 2009. It was presented annually until 2020, when the category was split.\nAs of 2025[ [update]] the Prix du premier film Loridan-Ivens (First Film Loridan-Ivens Award) is awarded each year at the Cin\u00e9ma du R\u00e9el film festival. The Loridan-Ivens Award was initiated by Loridan-Ivens to support emerging committed filmmakers \"casting a sharp eye on the state of the world\". It is given in honour of her husband Joris Ivens, who was an early supporter Cin\u00e9ma du R\u00e9el. The prize was formerly known as the Joris Ivens Prize for a Young Filmmaker, or just Joris Ivens Award.\nA statue of Ivens by sculptor Bryan McCormack was erected in Parc de Saint-Cloud in Paris in 2010.\nThe Joris Ivens European Foundation (Europese Stichting Joris Ivens) includes an archive of Ivens' work, as well as other features relating to him.\nFilmography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a body length of up to and a weight of up to , it is the biggest cat species in the Americas and the third largest in the world. Its distinctively marked coat features pale yellow to tan colored fur covered by spots that transition to rosettes on the sides, although a melanistic black coat appears in some individuals. The jaguar's powerful bite allows it to pierce the carapaces of turtles and tortoises, and to employ an unusual killing method: it bites directly through the skull of mammalian prey between the ears to deliver a fatal blow to the brain.\nThe modern jaguar's ancestors probably entered the Americas from Eurasia during the Early Pleistocene via the land bridge that once spanned the Bering Strait. Today, the jaguar's range extends from the Southwestern United States across Mexico and much of Central America, the Amazon rainforest and south to Paraguay and northern Argentina. It inhabits a variety of forested and open terrains, but its preferred habitat is tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest, wetlands and wooded regions. It is adept at swimming and is largely a solitary, opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush apex predator. As a keystone species, it plays an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and in regulating prey populations.\nThe jaguar is threatened by habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, poaching for trade with its body parts and killings in human\u2013wildlife conflict situations, particularly with ranchers in Central and South America. It has been listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List since 2002. The wild population is thought to have declined since the late 1990s. Priority areas for jaguar conservation comprise 51 Jaguar Conservation Units (JCUs), defined as large areas inhabited by at least 50 breeding jaguars. The JCUs are located in 36 geographic regions ranging from Mexico to Argentina.\nThe jaguar has featured prominently in the mythology of indigenous peoples of the Americas, including those of the Aztec and Maya civilizations.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"jaguar\" is possibly derived from the Tupi-Guarani word meaning 'wild beast that overcomes its prey at a bound'. Because \"jaguar\" also applies to other animals, indigenous peoples in Guyana call it , with the added sufix \"et\u00e9\", meaning \"true beast\".\n\"Onca\" is derived from the Portuguese name for a spotted cat that is larger than a lynx; cf. \"ounce\". The word \"panther\" is derived from classical Latin , itself from the ancient Greek ().\nIn North America, the word is pronounced with two syllables, as , while in British English, it is pronounced with three, as .\nTaxonomy and evolution.\nTaxonomy.\nIn 1758, Carl Linnaeus described the jaguar in his work \"Systema Naturae\" and gave it the scientific name \"Felis onca\".\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, several jaguar type specimens formed the basis for descriptions of subspecies. In 1939, Reginald Innes Pocock recognized eight subspecies based on the geographic origins and skull morphology of these specimens.\nPocock did not have access to sufficient zoological specimens to critically evaluate their subspecific status but expressed doubt about the status of several. Later consideration of his work suggested only three subspecies should be recognized. The description of \"P. o. palustris\" was based on a fossil skull.\nBy 2005, nine subspecies were considered to be valid taxa:\nReginald Innes Pocock placed the jaguar in the genus \"Panthera\" and observed that it shares several morphological features with the leopard (\"P. pardus\"). He, therefore, concluded that they are most closely related to each other. Results of morphological and genetic research indicate a clinal north\u2013south variation between populations, but no evidence for subspecific differentiation. DNA analysis of 84 jaguar samples from South America revealed that the gene flow between jaguar populations in Colombia was high in the past. Since 2017, the jaguar is considered to be a monotypic taxon, though the modern \"Panthera onca onca\" is still distinguished from two fossil subspecies, \"Panthera onca augusta\" and \"Panthera onca mesembrina\". However, the 2024 study suggested that the validity of subspecific assignments on both \"P. o. augusta\" and \"P. o. mesembrina\" remains unresolved, since both fossil and living jaguars show a considerable variation in morphometry.\nEvolution.\nThe \"Panthera\" lineage is estimated to have genetically diverged from the common ancestor of the Felidae around https:// 4.47 to https:// 0.97. Some genetic analyzes place the jaguar as a sister species to the lion with which it diverged https:// 1.22, but other studies place the lion closer to the leopard.\nThe lineage of the jaguar appears to have originated in Africa and spread to Eurasia 1.95\u20131.77 mya. The living jaguar species is often suggested to have descended from the Eurasian \"Panthera gombaszogensis.\" The ancestor of the jaguar entered the American continent via Beringia, the land bridge that once spanned the Bering Strait, Some authors have disputed the close relationship between \"P. gombaszogensis\" (which is primarily known from Eurasia) and the modern jaguar. The oldest fossils of modern jaguars (\"P. onca\") have been found in North America dating between 850,000-820,000 years ago. Results of mitochondrial DNA analysis of 37 jaguars indicate that current populations evolved between 510,000 and 280,000 years ago in northern South America and subsequently recolonized North and Central America after the extinction of jaguars there during the Late Pleistocene.\nTwo extinct subspecies of jaguar are recognized in the fossil record: the North American \"P. o. augusta\" and South American \"P. o. mesembrina\".\nDescription.\nThe jaguar is a compact and muscular animal. It is the largest cat native to the Americas and the third largest in the world, exceeded in size only by the tiger and the lion. It stands tall at the shoulders.\nIts size and weight vary considerably depending on sex and region: weights in most regions are normally in the range of . Exceptionally big males have been recorded to weigh as much as .\nThe smallest females from Middle America weigh about . It is sexually dimorphic, with females typically being 10\u201320% smaller than males. The length from the nose to the base of the tail varies from . The tail is long and the shortest of any big cat.\nIts muscular legs are shorter than the legs of other \"Panthera\" species with similar body weight.\nSize tends to increase from north to south. Jaguars in the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve on the Pacific coast of central Mexico weighed around .\nJaguars in Venezuela and Brazil are much larger, with average weights of about in males and of about in females.\nThe jaguar's coat ranges from pale yellow to tan or reddish-yellow, with a whitish underside and covered in black spots. The spots and their shapes vary: on the sides, they become rosettes which may include one or several dots. The spots on the head and neck are generally solid, as are those on the tail where they may merge to form bands near the end and create a black tip. They are elongated on the middle of the back, often connecting to create a median stripe, and blotchy on the belly. These patterns serve as camouflage in areas with dense vegetation and patchy shadows.\nJaguars living in forests are often darker and considerably smaller than those living in open areas, possibly due to the smaller numbers of large, herbivorous prey in forest areas.\nThe jaguar closely resembles the leopard but is generally more robust, with stockier limbs and a more square head. The rosettes on a jaguar's coat are larger, darker, fewer in number and have thicker lines, with a small spot in the middle.\nIt has powerful jaws with the third-highest bite force of all felids, after the tiger and the lion.\nIt has an average bite force at the canine tip of 887.0 Newton and a bite force quotient at the canine tip of 118.6.\nA jaguar can bite with a force of with the canine teeth and at the carnassial notch.\nColor variation.\nMelanistic jaguars are also known as black panthers. The black morph is less common than the spotted one.\nBlack jaguars have been documented in Central and South America. Melanism in the jaguar is caused by deletions in the melanocortin 1 receptor gene and inherited through a dominant allele. Black jaguars occur at higher densities in tropical rainforest and are more active during the daytime. This suggests that melanism provides camouflage in dense vegetation with high illumination.\nIn 2004, a camera trap in the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains photographed the first documented black jaguar in Northern Mexico. Black jaguars were also photographed in Costa Rica's Alberto Manuel Brenes Biological Reserve, in the mountains of the Cordillera de Talamanca, in Barbilla National Park and in eastern Panama.\nDistribution and habitat.\nIn 1999, the jaguar's historic range at the turn of the 20th century was estimated at , stretching from the southern United States through Central America to southern Argentina. By the turn of the 21st century, its global range had decreased to about , with most declines occurring in the southern United States, northern Mexico, northern Brazil, and southern Argentina.\nIts present range extends from the United States, Mexico, through Central America to South America comprising Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, particularly on the Osa Peninsula, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. It is considered to be locally extinct in El Salvador and Uruguay.\nJaguars have been occasionally sighted in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, with 62 accounts reported in the 20th century.\nBetween 2012 and 2015, a male vagrant jaguar was recorded in 23 locations in the Santa Rita Mountains. Eight jaguars were photographed in the southwestern US between 1996 and 2024. \nThe jaguar prefers dense forest and typically inhabits dry deciduous forests, tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, rainforests and cloud forests in Central and South America; open, seasonally flooded wetlands, dry grassland and historically also oak forests in the United States. It has been recorded at elevations up to but avoids montane forests. It favors riverine habitat and swamps with dense vegetation cover. In the Mayan forests of Mexico and Guatemala, 11 GPS-collared jaguars preferred undisturbed dense habitat away from roads; females avoided even areas with low levels of human activity, whereas males appeared less disturbed by human population density. A young male jaguar was also recorded in the semi-arid Sierra de San Carlos at a waterhole.\nFormer range.\nIn the 19th century, the jaguar was still sighted at the North Platte River north of Longs Peak in Colorado, in coastal Louisiana, northern Arizona and New Mexico.\nMultiple verified zoological reports of the jaguar are known in California, two as far north as Monterey in 1814 and 1826. The only record of an active jaguar den with breeding adults and kittens in the United States was in the Tehachapi Mountains of California prior to 1860. The jaguar persisted in California until about 1860.\nThe last confirmed jaguar in Texas was shot in 1948, southeast of Kingsville, Texas.\nIn Arizona, a female was shot in the White Mountains in 1963. By the late 1960s, the jaguar was thought to have been extirpated in the United States. Arizona outlawed jaguar hunting in 1969, but by then no females remained, and over the next 25 years only two males were sighted and killed in the state. In 1996, a rancher and hunting guide from Douglas, Arizona came across a jaguar in the Peloncillo Mountains and became a researcher on jaguars, placing trail cameras, which recorded four more jaguars.\nBehavior and ecology.\nThe jaguar is mostly active at night and during twilight.\nHowever, jaguars living in densely forested regions of the Amazon rainforest and the Pantanal are largely active by day, whereas jaguars in the Atlantic Forest are primarily active by night.\nThe activity pattern of the jaguar coincides with the activity of its main prey species. Jaguars are good swimmers and play and hunt in the water, possibly more than tigers. They have been recorded moving between islands and the shore, swimming distances of at least 1.3km. Jaguars are also good at climbing trees but do so less often than cougars.\nEcological role.\nThe adult jaguar is an apex predator, meaning it is at the top of the food chain and is not preyed upon in the wild. The jaguar has also been termed a keystone species, as it is assumed that it controls the population levels of prey such as herbivorous and seed-eating mammals and thus maintains the structural integrity of forest systems.\nHowever, field work has shown this may be natural variability, and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the keystone predator hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.\nThe jaguar is sympatric with the cougar. In central Mexico, both prey on white-tailed deer, which makes up 54% and 66% of jaguar and cougar's prey, respectively. In northern Mexico, the jaguar and the cougar share the same habitat, and their diet overlaps dependent on prey availability. Jaguars seemed to prefer deer and calves. In Mexico and Central America, neither of the two cats are considered to be the dominant predator.\nIn South America, the jaguar is larger than the cougar and tends to take larger prey, usually over . The cougar's prey usually weighs between , which is thought to be the reason for its smaller size.\nThis situation may be advantageous to the cougar. Its broader prey niche, including its ability to take smaller prey, may give it an advantage over the jaguar in human-altered landscapes.\nHunting and diet.\nThe jaguar is an obligate carnivore and depends solely on flesh for its nutrient requirements. An analysis of 53 studies documenting the diet of the jaguar revealed that its prey ranges in weight from ; it prefers prey weighing , with the capybara and the giant anteater being the most selected. When available, it also preys on marsh deer, southern tamandua, collared peccary and black agouti. In floodplains, jaguars opportunistically take reptiles such as green anacondas, turtles and caimans. Consumption of reptiles appears to be more frequent in jaguars than in other big cats. One remote population in the Brazilian Pantanal is recorded to primarily feed on aquatic reptiles and fish.\nThe jaguar also preys on livestock in cattle ranching areas where wild prey is scarce.\nThe daily food requirement of a captive jaguar weighing was estimated at of meat.\nThe jaguar's bite force allows it to pierce the carapaces of the yellow-spotted Amazon river turtle and the yellow-footed tortoise. It employs an unusual killing method: it bites mammalian prey directly through the skull between the ears to deliver a fatal bite to the brain. It kills capybara by piercing its canine teeth through the temporal bones of its skull, breaking its zygomatic arch and mandible and penetrating its brain, often through the ears.\nIt has been hypothesized to be an adaptation to cracking open turtle shells; armored reptiles may have formed an abundant prey base for the jaguar following the late Pleistocene extinctions. However, this is disputed, as even in areas where jaguars prey on reptiles, they are still taken relatively infrequently compared to mammals in spite of their greater abundance.\nBetween October 2001 and April 2004, 10 jaguars were monitored in the southern Pantanal. In the dry season from April to September, they killed prey at intervals ranging from one to seven days; and ranging from one to 16 days in the wet season from October to March.\nThe jaguar uses a stalk-and-ambush strategy when hunting rather than chasing prey. The cat will slowly walk down forest paths, listening for and stalking prey before rushing or ambushing. The jaguar attacks from cover and usually from a target's blind spot with a quick pounce; the species' ambushing abilities are considered nearly peerless in the animal kingdom by both indigenous people and field researchers and are probably a product of its role as an apex predator in several different environments. The ambush may include leaping into water after prey, as a jaguar is quite capable of carrying a large kill while swimming; its strength is such that carcasses as large as a heifer can be hauled up a tree to avoid flood levels. After killing prey, the jaguar will drag the carcass to a thicket or other secluded spot. It begins eating at the neck and chest. The heart and lungs are consumed, followed by the shoulders.\nSocial activity.\nThe jaguar is generally solitary except for females with cubs. In 1977, groups consisting of a male, female and cubs, and two females with two males were sighted several times in a study area in the Paraguay River valley; a radio-collared female moved in a home range of , which partly overlapped with another female. The home range of the male in this study area overlapped with several females. In the Venezuelan Llanos and Brazilian Pantanal, male coalitions were detected, which marked, defended and invaded territories together, hunted together and mated with several females.\nThe jaguar uses scrape marks, urine, and feces to mark its territory.\nThe size of home ranges depends on the level of deforestation and human population density. The home ranges of females vary from in the Pantanal to in the Amazon to in the Atlantic Forest. Male jaguar home ranges vary from in the Pantanal to in the Amazon to in the Atlantic Forest and in the Cerrado.\nStudies employing GPS telemetry in 2003 and 2004 found densities of only six to seven jaguars per in the Pantanal region, compared with 10 to 11 using traditional methods; this suggests the widely used sampling methods may inflate the actual numbers of individuals in a sampling area. Fights between males occur but are rare, and avoidance behavior has been observed in the wild. In one wetland population with degraded territorial boundaries and more social proximity, adults of the same sex are more tolerant of each other and engage in more friendly and co-operative interactions.\nThe jaguar roars/grunts for long-distance communication; intensive bouts of counter-calling between individuals have been observed in the wild. This vocalization is described as \"hoarse\" with five or six guttural notes. Chuffing is produced by individuals when greeting, during courting, or by a mother comforting her cubs. This sound is described as low intensity snorts, possibly intended to signal tranquility and passivity. Cubs have been recorded bleating, gurgling and mewing.\nReproduction and life cycle.\nIn captivity, the female jaguar is recorded to reach sexual maturity at the age of about 2.5 years. Estrus lasts 7\u201315 days with an estrus cycle of 41.8 to 52.6 days. During estrus, she exhibits increased restlessness with rolling and prolonged vocalizations.\nShe is an induced ovulator but can also ovulate spontaneously.\nGestation lasts 91 to 111 days.\nThe male is sexually mature at the age of three to four years.\nHis mean ejaculate volume is 8.6\u00b11.3\u00a0ml.\nGeneration length of the jaguar is 9.8 years.\nIn the Pantanal, breeding pairs were observed to stay together for up to five days. Females had one to two cubs.\nThe young are born with closed eyes but open them after two weeks. Cubs are weaned at the age of three months but remain in the birth den for six months before leaving to accompany their mother on hunts.\nJaguars remain with their mothers for up to two years. They appear to rarely live beyond 11 years, but captive individuals may live 22 years.\nIn 2001, a male jaguar killed and partially consumed two cubs in Emas National Park. DNA paternity testing of blood samples revealed that the male was the father of the cubs. Two more cases of infanticide were documented in the northern Pantanal in 2013. To defend against infanticide, the female hides her cubs and distracts the male with courtship behavior.\nAttacks on humans.\nThe Spanish conquistadors feared the jaguar. According to Charles Darwin, the indigenous peoples of South America stated that people did not need to fear the jaguar as long as capybaras were abundant.\nThe first official record of a jaguar killing a human in Brazil dates to June 2008.\nTwo children were attacked by jaguars in Guyana.\nThe majority of known attacks on people happened when it had been cornered or wounded.\nThreats.\nThe jaguar is threatened by loss and fragmentation of habitat, illegal killing in retaliation for livestock depredation and for illegal trade in jaguar body parts. It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List since 2002, as the jaguar population has probably declined by 20\u201325% since the mid-1990s. Deforestation is a major threat to the jaguar across its range. Habitat loss was most rapid in drier regions such as the Argentine pampas, the arid grasslands of Mexico and the southwestern United States.\nIn 2002, it was estimated that the range of the jaguar had declined to about 46% of its range in the early 20th century. In 2018, it was estimated that its range had declined by 55% in the last century. The only remaining stronghold is the Amazon rainforest, a region that is rapidly being fragmented by deforestation.\nBetween 2000 and 2012, forest loss in the jaguar range amounted to , with fragmentation increasing in particular in corridors between Jaguar Conservation Units (JCUs).\nBy 2014, direct linkages between two JCUs in Bolivia were lost, and two JCUs in northern Argentina became completely isolated due to deforestation.\nIn Mexico, the jaguar is primarily threatened by poaching. Its habitat is fragmented in northern Mexico, in the Gulf of Mexico and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, caused by changes in land use, construction of roads and tourism infrastructure.\nIn Panama, 220 of 230 jaguars were killed in retaliation for predation on livestock between 1998 and 2014.\nIn Venezuela, the jaguar was extirpated in about 26% of its range in the country since 1940, mostly in dry savannas and unproductive scrubland in the northeastern region of Anzo\u00e1tegui.\nIn Ecuador, the jaguar is threatened by reduced prey availability in areas where the expansion of the road network facilitated access of human hunters to forests.\nIn the Alto Paran\u00e1 Atlantic forests, at least 117 jaguars were killed in Igua\u00e7u National Park and the adjacent Misiones Province between 1995 and 2008.\nSome Afro-Colombians in the Colombian Choc\u00f3 Department hunt jaguars for consumption and sale of meat.\nBetween 2008 and 2012, at least 15 jaguars were killed by livestock farmers in central Belize.\nThe international trade of jaguar skins boomed between the end of the Second World War and the early 1970s.\nSignificant declines occurred in the 1960s, as more than 15,000 jaguars were yearly killed for their skins in the Brazilian Amazon alone; the trade in jaguar skins decreased since 1973 when the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species was enacted.\nInterview surveys with 533 people in the northwestern Bolivian Amazon revealed that local people killed jaguars out of fear, in retaliation, and for trade.\nBetween August 2016 and August 2019, jaguar skins and body parts were seen for sale in tourist markets in the Peruvian cities of Lima, Iquitos and Pucallpa.\nHuman-wildlife conflict, opportunistic hunting and hunting for trade in domestic markets are key drivers for killing jaguars in Belize and Guatemala.\nSeizure reports indicate that at least 857 jaguars were involved in trade between 2012 and 2018, including 482 individuals in Bolivia alone; 31 jaguars were seized in China.\nBetween 2014 and early 2019, 760 jaguar fangs were seized that originated in Bolivia and were destined for China. Undercover investigations revealed that the smuggling of jaguar body parts is run by Chinese residents in Bolivia.\nConservation.\nThe jaguar is listed on CITES Appendix I, which means that all international commercial trade in jaguars or their body parts is prohibited. Hunting jaguars is prohibited in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, the United States, and Venezuela. Hunting jaguars is restricted in Guatemala and Peru. In Ecuador, hunting jaguars is prohibited, and it is classified as threatened with extinction.\nIn Guyana, it is protected as an endangered species, and hunting it is illegal.\nIn 1986, the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary was established in Belize as the world's first protected area for jaguar conservation.\nJaguar Conservation Units.\nIn 1999, field scientists from 18 jaguar range countries determined the most important areas for long-term jaguar conservation based on the status of jaguar population units, stability of prey base and quality of habitat. These areas, called \"Jaguar Conservation Units\" (JCUs), are large enough for at least 50 breeding individuals and range in size from ; 51 JCUs were designated in 36 geographic regions including:\nOptimal routes of travel between core jaguar population units were identified across its range in 2010 to implement wildlife corridors that connect JCUs. These corridors represent areas with the shortest distance between jaguar breeding populations, require the least possible energy input of dispersing individuals and pose a low mortality risk. They cover an area of and range in length from in Mexico and Central America and from in South America.\nCooperation with local landowners and municipal, state, or federal agencies is essential to maintain connected populations and prevent fragmentation in both JCUs and corridors.\nSeven of 13 corridors in Mexico are functioning with a width of at least and a length of no more than . The other corridors may hamper passage, as they are narrower and longer.\nIn August 2012, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service set aside in Arizona and New Mexico for the protection of the jaguar. The Jaguar Recovery Plan was published in April 2019, in which Interstate 10 is considered to form the northern boundary of the Jaguar Recovery Unit in Arizona and New Mexico.\nIn Mexico, a national conservation strategy was developed from 2005 on and published in 2016. The Mexican jaguar population increased from an estimated 4,000 individuals in 2010 to about 4,800 individuals in 2018. This increase is seen as a positive effect of conservation measures that were implemented in cooperation with governmental and non-governmental institutions and landowners.\nAn evaluation of JCUs from Mexico to Argentina revealed that they overlap with high-quality habitats of about 1,500 mammals to varying degrees. Since co-occurring mammals benefit from the JCU approach, the jaguar has been called an umbrella species.\nCentral American JCUs overlap with the habitat of 187 of 304 regional endemic amphibian and reptile species, of which 19 amphibians occur only in the jaguar range.\nApproaches.\nIn setting up protected reserves, efforts generally also have to be focused on the surrounding areas, as jaguars are unlikely to confine themselves to the bounds of a reservation, especially if the population is increasing in size. Human attitudes in the areas surrounding reserves and laws and regulations to prevent poaching are essential to make conservation areas effective.\nTo estimate population sizes within specific areas and to keep track of individual jaguars, camera trapping and wildlife tracking telemetry are widely used, and feces are sought out with the help of detection dogs to study jaguar health and diet.\nCurrent conservation efforts often focus on educating ranch owners and promoting ecotourism.\nConservationists and professionals in Mexico and the United States have established the Northern Jaguar Reserve in northern Mexico. Advocacy for reintroduction of the jaguar to its former range in Arizona and New Mexico have been supported by documentation of natural migrations by individual jaguars into the southern reaches of both states, the recency of extirpation from those regions by human action, and supportive arguments pertaining to biodiversity, ecological, human, and practical considerations.\nIn culture and mythology.\nIn the pre-Columbian Americas, the jaguar was a symbol of power and strength. In the Andes, a jaguar cult disseminated by the early Chav\u00edn culture became accepted over most of today's Peru by 900 BC. The later Moche culture in northern Peru used the jaguar as a symbol of power in many of their ceramics. In the Muisca religion in Altiplano Cundiboyacense, the jaguar was considered a sacred animal, and people dressed in jaguar skins during religious rituals.\nThe skins were traded with peoples in the nearby Orinoqu\u00eda Region.\nThe name of the Muisca ruler Nemequene was derived from the Chibcha words \"nymy\" and \"quyne\", meaning \"force of the jaguar\".\nSculptures with \"Olmec were-jaguar\" motifs were found on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Veracruz and Tabasco; they show stylized jaguars with half-human faces. In the later Maya civilization, the jaguar was known as \"balam\" or \"bolom\" in many of the Mayan languages, and was used to symbolize warriors and the elite class for being brave, fierce and strong. It was associated with the underworld and its image was used to decorate tombs and grave-good vessels.\nThe Aztec civilization called the jaguar \"ocelotl\" and considered it to be the king of the animals. It was believed to be fierce and courageous, but also wise, dignified and careful. The military had two classes of warriors, the \"ocelotl\" or jaguar warriors and the \"cuauhtli\" or eagle warriors and each dressed like their representative animal. In addition, members of the royal class would decorate in jaguar skins. The jaguar was considered to be the totem animal of the powerful deities Tezcatlipoca and Tepeyollotl.\nA conch shell gorget depicting a jaguar was found in a burial mound in Benton County, Missouri. The gorget shows evenly-engraved lines and measures .\nRock drawings made by the Hopi, Anasazi and Pueblo all over the desert and chaparral regions of the American Southwest show an explicitly spotted cat, presumably a jaguar, as it is drawn much larger than an ocelot.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many of his later murders involved necrophilia, cannibalism and the permanent preservation of body parts\u2014typically all or part of the skeleton.\nAlthough he was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, and a psychotic disorder, Dahmer was found to be legally sane at his trial. He was convicted of fifteen of the sixteen homicides he had committed in Wisconsin and was sentenced to fifteen terms of life imprisonment on February 17, 1992. Dahmer was later sentenced to a sixteenth term of life imprisonment for an additional homicide committed in Ohio in 1978.\nOn November 28, 1994, Dahmer was beaten to death by Christopher Scarver, a fellow inmate at the Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, Wisconsin.\nEarly life.\nChildhood.\nJeffrey Lionel Dahmer was born on May 21, 1960, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the first of two sons to Lionel Herbert Dahmer, a Marquette University chemistry student and later a research chemist, and Joyce Annette Dahmer (n\u00e9e\u00a0Flint), a teletype machine instructor. Lionel was of German and Welsh ancestry, and Joyce was of Norwegian and Irish ancestry.\nSome sources report Dahmer was deprived of attention as an infant. Other sources, however, suggest that Dahmer was generally doted upon as an infant and toddler by both parents, although his mother was known to be tense, greedy for both attention and pity, and argumentative with her husband and their neighbors.\nAs Dahmer entered first grade, Lionel's studies kept him away from home much of the time. When he was home, his wife\u2014a hypochondriac who suffered from depression\u2014demanded constant attention and spent an increasing amount of time in bed. On one occasion, she attempted suicide using Equanil. Neither parent devoted much time to their son, who later recollected that, from an early age, he felt \"unsure of the solidity of the family\", recalling extreme tension and numerous arguments between his parents during his early years.\nDahmer had been an \"energetic and happy child\" but became notably subdued after undergoing double hernia surgery shortly before his fourth birthday. At elementary school, Dahmer was regarded as quiet and timid. One teacher recollected she detected early signs of abandonment due to his father's absence and mother's illnesses, the symptoms of which increased when she became pregnant with her second child. In elementary school, Dahmer had a small number of friends.\nIn October 1966, the family moved to Doylestown, Ohio. When Joyce gave birth in December, Dahmer was allowed to choose the name of his new baby brother; he chose the name David. The same year, Lionel earned his degree and started work as an analytical chemist in nearby Akron.\nFrom an early age, Dahmer manifested an interest in dead animals. His fascination with dead animals may have begun when, at the age of four, he saw his father removing animal bones from beneath the family home. According to Lionel, Dahmer was \"oddly thrilled\" by the sound the bones made, and became preoccupied with animal bones, which he initially called his \"fiddlesticks\". He occasionally searched beneath and around the family home for additional bones, and explored the bodies of live animals to discover where their bones were located.\nIn May 1968, the family moved to Bath Township, Summit County, Ohio. This address was their third in two years, and the Dahmers' sixth address since marriage. The home stood in one and a half acres of woodland, with a small hut a short walk from the house where Dahmer began collecting large insects and the skeletons of small animals, such as chipmunks and squirrels. Some of these remains were preserved in jars of formaldehyde and stored within the hut.\nTwo years later, during a chicken dinner, Dahmer asked Lionel what would happen if the chicken bones were placed in bleach. Lionel, pleased by what he believed to be his son's scientific curiosity, demonstrated how to safely bleach and preserve animal bones. Dahmer incorporated these preserving techniques into his bone collecting. He also began collecting dead animals\u2014including roadkill\u2014which he would dissect and bury beside the hut, with the skulls occasionally placed atop makeshift crosses.\nAccording to one friend, Dahmer explained that he was curious as to how animals \"fit together\". In one instance in 1975, Dahmer decapitated the carcass of a dog before nailing the body to a tree and impaling the skull upon a stick in the woodland behind his house. As a \"prank\", he later invited a friend to view the display, claiming he had discovered the remains by chance. The same year Lionel taught his son how to preserve animal bones, Joyce began increasing her daily consumption of Equanil, laxatives and sleeping pills, further increasing her emotional distance from her husband and children.\nAdolescence and high school.\nFrom his freshman year at Revere High School, Dahmer was seen as an outcast. By age 14, he had begun drinking beer and hard alcohol in the daylight hours, frequently concealing his liquor inside the jacket he wore to school. When a classmate asked why he was drinking whisky in a morning history class, Dahmer shrugged and said the alcohol was \"my medicine\". Although largely uncommunicative, in his freshman year Dahmer was seen by staff as polite and highly intelligent, but earned only average grades. He was a competitive tennis player and played briefly in the high school band.\nWhen he reached puberty, Dahmer discovered he was gay; he did not tell his parents. In his early teens, he had a brief relationship with another teenage boy, although they never had intercourse. By Dahmer's admission, he began fantasizing about dominating and controlling a completely submissive male partner in his early to mid-teens, and his masturbatory fantasies gradually evolved to his focusing on chests and torsos. These fantasies gradually became intertwined with dissection.\nWhen he was about 16, Dahmer conceived a fantasy of rendering unconscious a particular male jogger he found attractive, and then making sexual use of his body. On one occasion, Dahmer concealed himself in bushes with a baseball bat to lie in wait for this man. However, the jogger did not pass by on that particular day. Dahmer later admitted this was his first attempt to attack and render an individual submissive to him.\nDahmer was known to his high school peers as a class clown who often staged pranks, which became known as \"Doing a Dahmer\"; these included bleating and simulating epileptic seizures or cerebral palsy at school and local stores. Occasionally, Dahmer would perform these antics for money to purchase alcohol.\nBy 1977, Dahmer's grades had declined. His parents hired a private tutor, with limited success. The same year, in an attempt to save their marriage, his parents attended counseling sessions. They continued to quarrel frequently. When Lionel discovered Joyce had engaged in a brief affair in September 1977, they decided to divorce, telling their sons they wished to do so amicably. The process of their divorce soon became increasingly bitter and acrimonious, and Lionel moved out of the house in early 1978, temporarily residing in a motel on North Cleveland Massillon Road.\nIn May 1978, Dahmer graduated from high school. A few weeks before his graduation, one of his teachers observed Dahmer sitting close to the school parking lot, drinking several cans of beer. When the teacher threatened to report the matter, Dahmer informed him he was experiencing \"a lot of problems\" at home and that the school's guidance counselor was aware of them. That spring, Joyce\u2014contrary to a court order and without informing Lionel\u2014moved out of the family home with David to live with relatives in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. Dahmer had just turned 18 and remained in the family home. Dahmer's parents' divorce was finalized on July 24, 1978. Joyce was awarded custody of their younger son and alimony payments.\nLate teens and early 20s: first murder.\nMurder of Steven Hicks.\nDahmer committed his first murder in 1978, three weeks after his graduation. On June 18, Dahmer picked up a hitchhiker named Steven Mark Hicks, who was 18 years old. Hicks, who had been hitchhiking to a rock concert at Chippewa Lake Park, agreed to accompany Dahmer to his house upon the promise of \"a few beers\" with Dahmer, who had the house to himself.\nAccording to Dahmer, the sight of the bare-chested Hicks standing at the roadside stirred his sexual feelings, although when Hicks began talking about girls, he knew any sexual passes he made would be rebuffed. After several hours of talking, drinking and listening to music, Hicks \"wanted to leave and I didn't want him to leave\". Dahmer bludgeoned Hicks with a dumbbell. He later stated he struck Hicks twice from behind with the dumbbell as Hicks sat upon a chair. When Hicks fell unconscious, Dahmer strangled him to death with the bar of the dumbbell, then stripped the clothes from Hicks's body before exploring his chest with his hands, then masturbating as he stood above the corpse. Hours later, Dahmer dragged the body to the basement.\nThe following day, Dahmer dissected Hicks's body in the basement. He later buried the remains in a shallow grave in his back yard. Several weeks later, he unearthed the remains and pared the flesh from the bones. He dissolved the flesh in acid before flushing the solution down the toilet; he crushed the bones with a sledgehammer and scattered them in the woodland behind the family home. He threw Hicks's necklace and the knife used to dismember him from the West Bath Road Bridge into the Cuyahoga River.\nCollege and Army service.\nSix weeks after the murder of Hicks, Dahmer's father and his fianc\u00e9e returned to his home, where they discovered Dahmer living alone. That August, Dahmer enrolled at Ohio State University (OSU), hoping to major in business. Dahmer's sole term at OSU was completely unproductive, largely because of his persistent alcohol abuse. He received failing grades in Introduction to Anthropology, Classical Civilizations, and Administrative Science. The only course Dahmer was successful at was Riflery, where he received a B\u2212 grade. His overall GPA was 0.45/4.0. On one occasion, Lionel paid a surprise visit to his son, only to find his dormitory room strewn with empty liquor bottles. Despite his father having paid in advance for the second term, Dahmer dropped out of OSU after just three months.\nIn January 1979, on his father's urging, Dahmer enlisted in the United States Army. He underwent basic training at Fort McClellan in Anniston, Alabama, before training as a medical specialist at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. He was occasionally reprimanded for intoxication while stationed at Fort Sam Houston. On one occasion, an instance of insubordination resulted in his entire platoon being punished, earning Dahmer a severe beating from his fellow recruits.\nOn July 13, 1979, Dahmer was deployed to Baumholder, West Germany, where he served as a combat medic in the 2nd Battalion, 68th Armored Regiment, 8th Infantry Division. According to published reports, in Dahmer's first year of service, he was an \"average or slightly above average\" soldier.\nOwing to Dahmer's alcohol abuse, his performance deteriorated, and, in March 1981, he was deemed unsuitable for military service and was later discharged from the Army. He received an honorable discharge, as his superiors did not believe that any problems Dahmer had in the Army would be applicable to civilian life.\nOn March 24, 1981, Dahmer was sent to Fort Jackson in South Carolina for debriefing and provided with a plane ticket to travel anywhere in the country. Dahmer later told police he felt he could not return home to face his father, so he opted to travel to Miami Beach, Florida, both because he was \"tired of the cold\" and in an attempt to live by his own means. In Florida, Dahmer found a job at a delicatessen and rented a room in a nearby motel. He spent most of his salary on alcohol and was soon evicted from the motel for non-payment. Dahmer initially spent his evenings on the beach as he continued to work at the sandwich shop until phoning his father and asking to return to Ohio in September of the same year.\nReturn to Ohio and relocation to West Allis, Wisconsin.\nAfter his return to Ohio, Dahmer initially lived with his father and stepmother and insisted on being delegated numerous chores to occupy his time while he looked for work. He continued to drink heavily, and two weeks after his return, was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct. He was fined $60 and given a suspended 10-day jail sentence. Dahmer's father tried unsuccessfully to wean his son off alcohol. In December 1981, he and his second wife sent him to live with his paternal grandmother, Catherine Dahmer, in West Allis, Wisconsin. As she was the only family member to whom Dahmer displayed any positivity or affection, they hoped that both her influence and the change of location might persuade him to quit drinking, find a job, and live responsibly.\nInitially, Dahmer's living arrangements with his grandmother were harmonious: he accompanied her to church, willingly undertook chores, actively sought work, and abided by most of her house rules (although he continued to drink and smoke). In early 1982, he found employment as a phlebotomist at the Milwaukee Blood Plasma Center. He held this job for a total of ten months before being laid off. Dahmer remained unemployed for over two years, during which he lived upon whatever money his grandmother gave him.\nShortly before losing his job, Dahmer was arrested for indecent exposure. On August 8, 1982, at Wisconsin State Fair Park, he was observed exposing himself \"on the south side of the Coliseum in which 25 people were present including women and children\". For this incident, he was convicted and fined $50 plus court costs.\nIn January 1985, Dahmer was hired as a mixer at the Milwaukee Ambrosia Chocolate Factory, where he worked from 11\u00a0p.m to 7\u00a0a.m. six nights per week, with Saturday evenings off. Shortly after he started this job, an incident occurred in which Dahmer was propositioned by another man while reading in the West Allis Public Library. The stranger threw Dahmer a note offering to perform fellatio upon him. Although Dahmer did not respond to this proposition, the incident stirred the fantasies of control and dominance he had developed as a teenager, and he began to familiarize himself with Milwaukee's gay bars, gay bathhouses, and bookstores. He also stole a male mannequin from a store, which he briefly used for sexual stimulation, until his grandmother discovered the item stowed in a closet and demanded that he discard it.\nBy late 1985, Dahmer had begun to regularly frequent the bathhouses, which he later described as being \"relaxing places\", but during his sexual encounters, he became frustrated at his partners' moving during the act. Following his arrest, he stated: \"I trained myself to view people as objects of pleasure instead of [as] people\". For this reason, beginning in June 1986, he administered sleeping pills to his partners, giving them liquor laced with sedatives. He then waited for his partner to fall asleep before performing various sexual acts. To maintain an adequate supply of this medication, Dahmer informed doctors he worked nights and required the tablets to adjust to that schedule. After approximately 12 such instances, the bathhouses' administration revoked Dahmer's membership, and he began to use hotel rooms to continue this practice.\nShortly after his bathhouse memberships were revoked, Dahmer read a report in a newspaper regarding the upcoming funeral of an 18-year-old male. He conceived the idea of stealing the freshly interred corpse and taking it home. According to Dahmer, he attempted to dig up the coffin from the ground but found the soil too hard and abandoned the plan.\nOn September 8, 1986, Dahmer was arrested upon a charge of lewd and lascivious behavior for masturbating in the presence of two 12-year-old boys as he stood close to the Kinnickinnic River. He initially claimed he had merely been urinating, unaware that there were witnesses, but soon admitted the offense. The charge was changed to disorderly conduct and, on March 10, 1987, Dahmer was sentenced to one year of probation, with additional instructions to undergo counseling.\nLate 20s and early 30s: subsequent murders.\nAmbassador Hotel.\nOn November 20, 1987, Dahmer, at the time still residing with his grandmother, encountered a 25-year-old man from Ontonagon, Michigan, named Steven Tuomi at a bar and persuaded him to return to the Ambassador Hotel in Milwaukee, where Dahmer had rented a room for the evening. According to Dahmer, he had no intention of killing Tuomi, but intended to simply drug him and lie beside him as he explored his body. The following morning, Dahmer awoke to find Tuomi lying beneath him on the bed, his chest \"crushed in\" and \"black and blue\" with bruises. Blood was seeping from the corner of his mouth, and Dahmer's fists and one forearm were extensively bruised. Dahmer later said he had no memory of having killed Tuomi, and that he \"could not believe this had happened\".\nDahmer purchased a large suitcase, in which he transported Tuomi's body to his grandmother's residence. One week later, he severed the head, arms, and legs, then filleted the bones from the body before cutting the flesh into pieces small enough to handle. Dahmer placed the flesh inside plastic garbage bags. He wrapped the bones inside a sheet and pounded them into splinters with a sledgehammer. The dismemberment process took Dahmer approximately two hours. He disposed of all of Tuomi's remains, excluding the head, in the trash.\nFor two weeks following Tuomi's killing, Dahmer retained Tuomi's head wrapped in a blanket. After two weeks, Dahmer boiled the head in a mixture of Soilax (an alkali-based industrial detergent) and bleach in an effort to retain the skull, which he then used as stimulus for masturbation. Eventually, the skull became too brittle by this bleaching process, so Dahmer pulverized and disposed of it.\nIntermediate murders.\nAccording to Dahmer, Tuomi's murder was a pivotal incident after which he did not try to control his compulsions. He began to actively seek victims, most of whom he encountered in or around gay bars and would typically lure them to his grandmother's home. He would drug his victim with triazolam or temazepam before or shortly after engaging in sexual activity with them. Once his victim was unconscious, he strangled them to death.\nTwo months after the Tuomi killing, Dahmer encountered a 14-year-old Native American prostitute, James Doxtator. Dahmer lured him to his grandmother's residence with an offer of $50 to pose for nude pictures. They engaged in sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Doxtator and strangled him on the floor of the cellar. Dahmer left the body in the cellar for one week before dismembering it in much the same manner as he had with Tuomi. He placed all of Doxtator's remains (excluding the skull) in the trash. The skull was boiled and cleansed in bleach before Dahmer found that it, too, had been rendered brittle by the process. He pulverized the skull two weeks later.\nOn March 24, 1988, Dahmer met a 22-year-old bisexual man, Richard Guerrero, outside a gay bar called the Phoenix. Dahmer lured Guerrero to his grandmother's residence, offering him $50 to spend the night with him. He drugged Guerrero with sleeping pills, strangled him with a leather strap, and performed oral sex on the corpse. Dahmer dismembered Guerrero's body within 24 hours, again disposing of the remains in the trash and retaining the skull before pulverizing it several months later.\nOn April 2, Dahmer lured Ronald Flowers Jr. to his house; however, after giving Flowers a drugged coffee, both he and Flowers heard Dahmer's grandmother call, \"Is that you, Jeff?\" Although Dahmer replied in a manner that led his grandmother to believe he was alone, she observed that he was not alone. Because of this, Dahmer was unable to kill Flowers. After Flowers became unconscious, Dahmer took him to the County General Hospital.\nIn September 1988, Dahmer's grandmother asked him to move out, largely because of his drinking, his habit of bringing young men to her house late at night, and the foul smells emanating from the basement and the garage. Dahmer found a one-bedroom apartment at 808 North 24th Street and moved into the residence on September 25. Two days later, he was arrested for drugging and sexually fondling a 13-year-old boy whom he had lured to his home on the pretext of posing nude for photographs.\nDahmer's father hired attorney Gerald Boyle to defend his son. At Boyle's request, Dahmer underwent a series of psychological evaluations prior to his court hearings. The evaluations found that Dahmer harbored deep feelings of alienation. A second evaluation two months later revealed Dahmer to be an impulsive individual, suspicious of others, and dismayed by his lack of accomplishments in life. His probation officer also referenced a 1987 diagnosis of Dahmer suffering from a schizoid personality disorder for presentation to the court.\nOn January 30, 1989, Dahmer pleaded guilty to the charges of second-degree sexual assault and of enticing a child for immoral purposes. Sentencing was suspended until May. On March 20, Dahmer commenced a ten-day Easter absence from work, during which he moved back into his grandmother's home.\nTwo months after his conviction and two months prior to his sentencing, Dahmer murdered his fifth victim, a 24-year-old mixed-race aspiring model, Anthony Sears, whom he met at a gay bar on March 25, 1989. According to Dahmer, on this particular occasion he was not looking to commit a crime; however, shortly before closing time that evening, Sears \"just started talking to me\". Dahmer lured Sears to his grandmother's home, where the pair engaged in oral sex before Dahmer drugged and strangled Sears.\nThe following morning, Dahmer placed the corpse in his grandmother's bathtub, where he decapitated the body before attempting to flay the corpse. He stripped the flesh from the body and pulverized the bones, which he disposed of in the trash. According to Dahmer, he found Sears \"exceptionally attractive\", and Sears was the first victim from whom he permanently retained any body parts: he preserved Sears' head and genitalia in acetone and stored them in a wooden box, which he later placed in his work locker. When he moved to a new address the following year, he took the remains there.\nOn May 23, 1989, Dahmer was sentenced to five years' probation and one year in the House of Correction, with work release permitted so he could keep his job. He was also required to register as a sex offender. Two months before his scheduled release, Dahmer was paroled from this regimen. His five years' probation imposed in 1989 began at this point. Dahmer temporarily moved back to his grandmother's home in West Allis.\nOxford Apartments.\n1990 murders.\nOn May 14, 1990, Dahmer moved out of his grandmother's house and into 924 North 25th Street, Apartment 213, taking Sears' mummified head and genitals with him. Although located in a high-crime area, Dahmer's new apartment was close to his workplace, was furnished, and at $300 per month inclusive of all bills excluding electricity, was economical. Within one week of his moving to this address, Dahmer killed his sixth victim, Raymond Smith. Smith was a 32-year-old prostitute whom Dahmer lured to his apartment with the promise of $50 for sex. Inside the apartment, he gave Smith a drink laced with seven sleeping pills, then manually strangled him.\nThe following day, Dahmer purchased a Polaroid camera, with which he took several pictures of Smith's body in suggestive positions before dismembering him in the bathroom. He boiled the legs, arms, and pelvis in a steel kettle with Soilax, which allowed him to rinse the bones in his sink. Dahmer dissolved the remainder of Smith's skeleton\u2014excluding the skull\u2014in a container filled with acid. He later spray-painted Smith's skull, which he placed alongside the skull of Sears upon a black towel inside a filing cabinet.\nApproximately one week after the murder of Smith, on or about May 27, Dahmer lured another young man to his apartment. On this occasion, Dahmer accidentally consumed the drink laden with sedatives intended for his guest. When he awoke the following day, he discovered the man had stolen several items of clothing, $300 and a watch. Dahmer never reported this incident to the police, although on May 29, he divulged to his probation officer that he had been robbed.\nIn June 1990, Dahmer lured a 27-year-old acquaintance, Edward Smith, to his apartment, where he drugged and strangled him. On this occasion, rather than immediately acidifying the skeleton or repeating previous processes of bleaching, which had rendered previous victims' skulls brittle, Dahmer placed Smith's skeleton in his freezer for several months in the hope it would not retain moisture. Freezing the skeleton did not remove moisture, and the skeleton of this victim was acidified several months later. Dahmer accidentally destroyed the skull when he placed it in the oven to dry\u2014a process that caused the skull to explode. Dahmer later informed police he had felt \"rotten\" about Smith's murder, as he had been unable to retain any parts of his body.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt was my way of remembering their appearance, their physical beauty. I also wanted to keep... if I couldn't keep them there with me whole, I at least could keep their skeletons.\nJeffrey Dahmer, recollecting his motivations for both photographing his victims, and retaining sections of their skeletal structure. February 1993.\nLess than three months after the murder of Edward Smith, Dahmer encountered a 22-year-old Chicago native named Ernest Miller outside a bookstore on the corner of North 27th Street. Miller agreed to accompany Dahmer to his apartment for $50 and further agreed to allow him to listen to his heart and stomach. When Dahmer attempted to perform oral sex upon Miller, he was informed, \"That'll cost you extra\", whereupon Dahmer gave Miller a drink laced with two sleeping pills.\nOn this occasion, Dahmer had only two sleeping pills to give his victim. Therefore, he killed Miller by slashing his carotid artery with the same knife he used to dissect his victims' bodies. Miller bled to death within minutes. Dahmer then posed the nude body for various suggestive Polaroid photographs before placing it in his bathtub for dismemberment. Dahmer repeatedly kissed and talked to the severed head while he dismembered the remainder of the body.\nDahmer wrapped Miller's heart, liver, biceps, and portions of flesh from the legs in plastic bags and placed them in the freezer for later consumption. He boiled the remaining flesh and organs into a \"jelly-like substance\" using Soilax, which enabled him to rinse the flesh off the skeleton, which he intended to retain. To preserve the skeleton, Dahmer placed the bones in a light bleach solution for 24 hours before allowing them to dry upon a cloth for one week. The severed head was initially placed in the refrigerator before being stripped of flesh, then painted and coated with enamel.\nThree weeks after the murder of Miller, on September 24, Dahmer encountered a 22-year-old father of two named David Thomas at the Grand Avenue Mall. He persuaded him to return to his apartment for a few drinks, with additional money on offer if he would pose for photographs. In his statement to police after his arrest, Dahmer said that, after giving Thomas a drink laden with sedatives, he did not feel attracted to him, but was afraid to allow him to awaken, fearing that he would be angry over having been drugged. Therefore, he strangled him and dismembered the body\u2014intentionally retaining no body parts whatsoever. He photographed the dismemberment process and retained these photographs, which later aided in Thomas's identification.\nFollowing the murder of Thomas, Dahmer did not kill anyone for almost five months, although on a minimum of five occasions between October 1990 and February 1991, he unsuccessfully attempted to lure men to his apartment. He regularly complained of feelings of both anxiety and depression to his probation officer throughout 1990, with frequent references to his sexuality, his solitary lifestyle, financial difficulties, and\u2014shortly before Thanksgiving\u2014his apprehension regarding meeting and facing his father and younger brother. On several occasions, Dahmer also referred to harboring suicidal thoughts.\n1991 murders.\nIn February 1991, Dahmer observed a 17-year-old named Curtis Straughter standing at a bus stop near Marquette University. According to Dahmer, he lured Straughter into his apartment with an offer of money for posing for nude photos, with the added incentive of sexual intercourse. Dahmer drugged Straughter, cuffed his hands behind his back, then strangled him to death with a leather strap. He then dismembered Straughter, retaining his skull, hands, and genitals and photographing each stage of the dismemberment process.\nLess than two months later, on April 7, Dahmer encountered a 19-year-old named Errol Lindsey walking to get a key cut. Dahmer lured Lindsey to his apartment where he drugged him, then drilled a hole in his skull through which he injected hydrochloric acid with a baster. According to Dahmer, Lindsey awoke after this experiment (which Dahmer had conceived in the hope of inducing a permanent, unresistant, submissive state), saying: \"I have a headache. What time is it?\" In response to this, Dahmer again drugged Lindsey, then strangled him. He decapitated Lindsey and retained his skull. He then flayed Lindsey's body, placing the skin in a solution of cold water and salt for several weeks in the hope of permanently retaining it. Reluctantly, he disposed of Lindsey's skin when he noted it had become too frayed and brittle.\nBy 1991, fellow residents of the Oxford Apartments had repeatedly complained to the building's manager, Sopa Princewill, of the foul smells emanating from Apartment 213, in addition to the sounds of falling objects and the occasional sound of a chainsaw. Princewill contacted Dahmer in response to these complaints on several occasions, although he initially excused the odors emanating from his apartment as being caused by his freezer breaking, causing the contents to become \"spoiled\". On later occasions, he informed Princewill that the reason for the resurgence of the odor was that several of his tropical fish had recently died, and that he would take care of the matter.\nOn May 24, 1991, Dahmer encountered 31-year-old aspiring model Tony Hughes at a nightclub. He was lured to Dahmer's apartment with an offer of money to pose for photographs. Hughes was drugged into unconsciousness before Dahmer injected hydrochloric acid into his skull in an effort to disable his will and render him submissive, although on this occasion, the drilling and injection proved fatal.\nOn the afternoon of May 26, 1991, Dahmer encountered a 14-year-old Lao teenager, Konerak Sinthasomphone, on Wisconsin Avenue. Unknown to Dahmer, Sinthasomphone was the younger brother of the boy he had molested in 1988. Dahmer offered Sinthasomphone money to accompany him to his apartment to pose for Polaroid pictures. According to Dahmer, Sinthasomphone was initially reluctant to the proposal, before changing his mind and accompanying him to his apartment, where he posed for two pictures in his underwear before Dahmer drugged him into unconsciousness and performed oral sex on him. Before Sinthasomphone fell unconscious, Dahmer led the boy into his bedroom, where the body of Tony Hughes, whom Dahmer had killed three days earlier, lay naked on the floor. According to Dahmer, he \"believed [that Sinthasomphone] saw this body\" yet did not react to seeing the bloated corpse\u2014likely because of the effects of the sleeping pills he had ingested.\nOn this occasion, Dahmer drilled a single narrow hole into the crown of Sinthasomphone's skull, through which he injected hydrochloric acid into the frontal lobe. Dahmer then drank several beers while lying alongside Sinthasomphone before briefly falling asleep, then leaving his apartment to drink at a bar and purchase more alcohol.\nIn the early morning hours of May 27, Dahmer returned toward his apartment to discover Sinthasomphone sitting naked on the corner of 25th and State, talking in Lao, with three distressed young women standing near him. Dahmer approached the women and told them that Sinthasomphone (whom he referred to by the alias John Hmong) was his friend, and attempted to lead him to his apartment by the arm. The three women dissuaded Dahmer, explaining they had phoned 9-1-1.\nUpon the arrival of two Milwaukee police officers, John Balcerzak and Joseph Gabrish, Dahmer's demeanor relaxed: he told the officers that Sinthasomphone was his 19-year-old boyfriend, that he had drunk too much following a quarrel, and that he frequently behaved in this manner when intoxicated. Dahmer added his lover had consumed Jack Daniel's whiskey that evening.\nThe three women were exasperated, and when one of the trio attempted to indicate to one of the officers\u2014both of whom had observed no injuries beyond a scrape to Sinthasomphone's knee and believed him to be intoxicated\u2014that Sinthasomphone had blood upon his testicles, was bleeding from his rectum and that he had seemingly struggled against Dahmer's attempts to walk him to his apartment prior to their arrival, the officer harshly informed her to \"butt out\", \"shut the hell up\" and to not interfere.\nShortly after the arrival of the Milwaukee police officers, three members of the Milwaukee Fire Department arrived at the scene. These individuals also examined Sinthasomphone for injuries and provided a yellow blanket for the police officers to cover Sinthasomphone. One of the three believed Sinthasomphone needed treatment, but the police officers directed the fire department personnel to leave. Shortly thereafter, officer Richard Porubcan arrived at the scene. He and Gabrish\u2014followed by Balcerzak\u2014escorted Dahmer and Sinthasomphone to Dahmer's apartment as Dahmer repeatedly commented on the general crime in the neighborhood and of his appreciation of the police.\nInside his apartment and in an effort to verify his claim that he and Sinthasomphone were lovers, Dahmer showed the officers the two semi-nude Polaroid pictures he had taken of Sinthasomphone the previous evening. Though Balcerzak said he smelled nothing unusual, Gabrish later stated he noted a strange scent reminiscent of excrement inside the apartment. This odor emanated from the decomposing body of Hughes. Dahmer stated that to investigate this odor, one officer simply \"peeked his head around the bedroom, but really didn't take a good look\". The officers then left, with a departing remark that Dahmer \"take good care\" of Sinthasomphone. This incident was listed by the officers as a \"domestic dispute\".\nUpon the departure of the three officers from his apartment, Dahmer again injected hydrochloric acid into Sinthasomphone's brain. This second injection proved fatal. The following day, May 28, Dahmer took a day's leave from work to devote himself to the dismemberment of the bodies of Sinthasomphone and Hughes. He retained both victims' skulls.\nOn June 30, Dahmer traveled to Chicago, where he encountered a 20-year-old named Matt Turner at a bus station. Turner accepted Dahmer's offer to travel to Milwaukee for a professional photo shoot. At the apartment, Dahmer drugged, strangled and dismembered Turner and placed his head and internal organs in separate plastic bags in the freezer. Turner was not reported missing. Five days later, on July 5, Dahmer lured 23-year-old Jeremiah Weinberger from a Chicago bar to his apartment on the promise of spending the weekend with him. He drugged Weinberger and twice injected boiling water through his skull, sending him into a coma from which he died two days later.\nOn July 15, Dahmer encountered 24-year-old Oliver Lacy at the corner of 27th and Kilbourn. Lacy agreed to Dahmer's ruse of posing nude for photographs and accompanied him to his apartment, where the pair engaged in tentative sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Lacy. On this occasion, Dahmer intended to prolong the time he spent with Lacy while alive. After unsuccessfully attempting to render Lacy unconscious with chloroform, he phoned his workplace to request a day's absence; this was granted, although the next day, he was suspended.\nAfter strangling Lacy, Dahmer had sex with the corpse before dismembering him. He placed Lacy's head and heart in the refrigerator and his skeleton in the freezer. Four days later, on July 19, Dahmer received word that he was dismissed. Upon receipt of this news, Dahmer lured 25-year-old Joseph Bradehoft to his apartment. Bradehoft was strangled and left lying on Dahmer's bed covered with a sheet for two days. On July 21, Dahmer removed the sheet to find the head covered in maggots. He decapitated the body, cleaned the head and placed it in the refrigerator. He later acidified Bradehoft's torso, along with those of two other victims killed within the previous month.\nArrest.\nCapture.\nOn July 22, 1991, Dahmer approached three men with an offer of $100 to accompany him to his apartment to pose for nude photographs, drink beer and simply keep him company. One of the trio, 32-year-old Tracy Edwards, agreed to accompany him to his apartment. Upon entering Dahmer's apartment, Edwards noted a foul odor and several boxes of hydrochloric acid on the floor, which Dahmer claimed to use for cleaning bricks. After some minor conversation, Edwards responded to Dahmer's request to turn his head and view his tropical fish, whereupon Dahmer placed a handcuff upon his wrist. When Edwards asked, \"What's happening?\" Dahmer unsuccessfully attempted to cuff his wrists together, then told Edwards to accompany him to the bedroom to pose for nude pictures. While inside the bedroom, Edwards noted nude male posters on the wall and that a videotape of \"The Exorcist\u00a0III\" was playing. He also noted a blue 57-gallon drum in the corner, from which a strong odor emanated.\nDahmer then brandished a knife and informed Edwards he intended to take nude pictures of him. In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he would allow him to do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV. Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and chanting before turning his attention back to him. He placed his head on Edwards's chest, listened to his heartbeat and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart.\nIn an effort to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and that he was not going to run away. Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity. When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he asked if they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning. Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again. When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.\nAt 11:30\u00a0p.m. on July 22, Edwards flagged down two Milwaukee police officers, Robert Rauth and Rolf Mueller, at the corner of North 25th Street. The officers noted Edwards had a handcuff attached to his wrist, whereupon he explained to the officers that a \"freak\" had placed the handcuffs upon him and asked if the police could remove them. When the officers' handcuff keys failed to fit the brand of handcuffs, Edwards agreed to accompany the officers to the apartment where, Edwards stated, he had spent the previous five hours before escaping.\nWhen the officers and Edwards arrived at Apartment 213, Dahmer invited the trio inside and acknowledged he had placed the handcuffs upon Edwards, although he offered no explanation as to why he had done so. At this point, Edwards divulged to the officers that Dahmer had also brandished a large knife upon him and that this had happened in the bedroom. Dahmer made no comment to this revelation, indicating to one of the officers, Mueller, that the key to the handcuffs was in his bedside dresser. As Mueller entered the bedroom, Dahmer attempted to pass Mueller to retrieve the key himself, whereupon the second officer present, Rauth, informed him to \"back off\".\nIn the bedroom, Mueller noted there was a large knife beneath the bed. He saw an open drawer that, upon closer inspection, contained scores of Polaroid pictures\u2014many of which were of human bodies in various stages of dismemberment. Mueller noted the decor indicated they had been taken in the same apartment in which they were standing. Mueller walked into the living room to show them to his partner, uttering the words, \"These are for real.\"\nWhen Dahmer saw that Mueller was holding several of his Polaroids, he fought with the officers in an effort to resist arrest. The officers quickly overpowered him, cuffed his hands behind his back, and called a second squad car for backup. At this point, Mueller opened the refrigerator to reveal the freshly severed head of a black male on the bottom shelf. As Dahmer lay pinned on the floor beneath Rauth, he turned his head towards the officers and muttered the words: \"For what I did I should be dead.\"\nA more detailed search of the apartment, conducted by the Milwaukee police's Criminal Investigation Bureau, revealed a total of four severed heads in Dahmer's kitchen. A total of seven skulls\u2014some painted, some bleached\u2014were found in Dahmer's bedroom and inside a closet. Investigators discovered collected blood drippings upon a tray at the bottom of Dahmer's refrigerator, plus two human hearts and a portion of arm muscle, each wrapped inside plastic bags upon the shelves. In Dahmer's freezer, investigators discovered an entire torso, plus a bag of human organs and flesh stuck to the ice at the bottom.\nElsewhere in Apartment 213, investigators discovered two entire skeletons, a pair of severed hands, two severed and preserved penises, a mummified scalp and, in the 57-gallon drum, three further dismembered torsos dissolving in the acid solution. A total of 74 Polaroid pictures detailing the dismemberment of Dahmer's victims were found. In reference to the recovery of body parts and artifacts at 924 North 25th Street, the chief medical examiner later stated: \"It was more like dismantling someone's museum than an actual crime scene.\"\nConfession.\nBeginning in the early hours of July 23, 1991, Dahmer was questioned by Detective Patrick Kennedy as to the murders he had committed and the evidence found at his apartment. Over the following two weeks, Kennedy and, later, Detective Dennis Murphy conducted numerous interviews with Dahmer which, when combined, totaled over 60 hours, with the detectives ultimately compiling a 178-page confession. Dahmer waived his right to have a lawyer present throughout his interrogations, adding he wished to confess all as he had \"created this horror and it only makes sense I do everything to put an end to it\". He readily admitted to having murdered sixteen young men in Wisconsin since 1987, with one further victim\u2014Steven Hicks\u2014killed in Ohio in 1978.\nMost of Dahmer's victims had been rendered unconscious prior to their murder, although some had died as a result of having acid or boiling water injected into their brain. As he had no memory of the killing of his second victim, Steven Tuomi, he was unsure whether he was unconscious when beaten to death, although he did concede it was possible that his viewing the exposed chest of Tuomi while in a drunken stupor may have led him to unsuccessfully attempt to tear Tuomi's heart from his chest. Almost all the murders Dahmer committed after moving into the Oxford Apartments had involved a ritual of posing the victims' bodies in suggestive positions\u2014typically with the chest thrust outwards\u2014prior to dismemberment.\nDahmer readily admitted to engaging in necrophilia with several of his victims' bodies, including performing sexual acts with their viscera as he dismembered their bodies in his bathtub. Having noted that much of the blood pooled inside his victims' chest after death, Dahmer first removed their internal organs, then suspended the torso so the blood drained into his bathtub, before dicing any organs he did not wish to retain and paring the flesh from the body. The bones he wished to dispose of were pulverized or acidified, with Soilax and bleach solutions used to aid in the preservation of the skeletons and skulls he wished to keep. Dahmer confessed to having consumed the hearts, liver, biceps, and portions of thigh of three victims he had killed at the Oxford Apartments (Raymond Smith, Ernest Miller and Oliver Lacy), and to have retained the flesh and organs of other victims for intended consumption. Typically, Dahmer would tenderize the body parts he intended to consume prior to preparing meals flavored with various condiments.\nReferencing his reasons for consuming his victims, Dahmer stated he had initially consumed portions of his victims due to \"curiosity\" before adding: \"I suppose, in an odd way, it made me feel they were even more a permanent part of me.\"\nDescribing the increase in his rate of killing in the two months prior to his arrest, Dahmer stated he had been \"completely swept along\" with his compulsion to kill, adding: \"It was an incessant and never-ending desire to be with someone at whatever cost. Someone good looking, really nice looking. It just filled my thoughts all day long.\" When asked as to why he had preserved a total of seven skulls and the entire skeletons of two victims, Dahmer stated he had been in the process of constructing a private altar of victims' skulls which he had intended to display on the black table located in his living room and upon which he had photographed the bodies of many of his victims.\nThis display of skulls was to be adorned at each side with the complete skeletons of Miller and Lacy. The four severed heads found in his kitchen were to have all flesh removed and used in this altar, as was the skull of at least one future victim. Incense sticks were to be placed at each end of the black table, above which Dahmer intended to place a large blue lamp with extending blue globe lights. The entire construction was to be placed before a window covered with a black, opaque shower curtain, in front of which Dahmer intended to sit in a black leather chair.\nWhen asked in a November 18, 1991, interview to whom the altar was dedicated, Dahmer replied: \"Myself ... It was a place where I could feel at home.\" He further described his intended altar as a \"place for meditation\", from where he believed he could draw a sense of power, adding: \"If this [his arrest] had happened six months later, that's what they would have found.\"\nIndictment.\nOn July 25, 1991, Dahmer was charged with four counts of first-degree murder. By August 22, he had been charged with a further eleven murders committed in Wisconsin. On September 14, investigators in Ohio, having uncovered hundreds of bone fragments in woodland behind the address in which Dahmer had confessed to killing his first victim, formally identified two molars and a vertebra with X-ray records of Hicks. Three days later, Dahmer was charged by authorities in Ohio with Hicks's murder.\nDahmer was not charged with the attempted murder of Edwards, nor with the murder of Tuomi. He was not charged with Tuomi's murder because the district attorney only brought charges where murder could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt and Dahmer had no memory of actually committing this particular murder, for which no physical evidence of the crime existed. At a scheduled preliminary hearing on January 13, 1992, Dahmer pleaded guilty but insane to 15 counts of murder.\nTrial.\nDahmer's trial began on January 30, 1992. He was tried in Milwaukee for the 15 counts of first-degree murder before Judge Laurence Gram. By pleading guilty on January 13 to the charges brought against him, Dahmer had waived his rights to a trial to establish guilt, as defined in Wisconsin law. Attorneys at Dahmer's trial debated whether he suffered from either a mental or a personality disorder. The prosecution claimed that any disorders did not deprive Dahmer of the ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to deprive him of the ability to resist his impulses. The defense argued that Dahmer suffered from a mental disease and was driven by obsessions and impulses he was unable to control.\nDefense experts argued that Dahmer was insane due to his necrophilic drive\u2014his compulsion to have sexual encounters with corpses. Defense expert Fred Berlin testified that Dahmer was unable to conform his conduct at the time that he committed the crimes due to his paraphilia or, more specifically, necrophilia. Judith Becker, a professor of psychiatry and psychology, was the second expert witness for the defense. Becker diagnosed Dahmer as a necrophiliac, although she added Dahmer had informed her, he preferred comatose sexual partners to deceased ones \"75 percent\" of the time. The final defense expert to testify, forensic psychiatrist Carl Wahlstrom, diagnosed Dahmer with necrophilia, borderline personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, alcohol dependence, and a psychotic disorder.\nOn February 8, a psychiatrist, Dr. Fred Fosdal, testified on behalf of the prosecution. Fosdal testified to his belief that Dahmer was without mental disease or defect at the time he committed the murders. He described Dahmer as a calculating and cunning individual, able to differentiate between right and wrong, with the ability to control his actions, and whose lust overpowered his morals. Although Fosdal did state his belief that Dahmer was a paraphiliac, his conclusion was that Dahmer was not a sadist.\nThe second and final witness to appear for the prosecution, forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz, began his testimony on February 12. Dietz testified that he did not believe Dahmer had any form of mental disease or defect at the time that he committed the crimes, stating that \"Dahmer went to great lengths to be alone with his victim and to have no witnesses.\" He explained that there was ample evidence that Dahmer prepared in advance for each murder, and therefore, his crimes were not impulsive. Although Dietz did concede any acquisition of a paraphilia was not a matter of personal choice, he stated his belief that Dahmer's habit of becoming intoxicated prior to committing each of the murders was significant; \"If he had an impulse to kill or a compulsion to kill\", Dietz testified, \"he wouldn't have to drink alcohol to overcome it. He only has to drink alcohol to overcome it because he is inhibited against killing.\"\nDietz noted that Dahmer strongly identified with the villains of \"The Exorcist III\" and \"Return of the Jedi\", particularly the level of power held by these characters. Expounding on the significance of these movies on Dahmer's psyche and many of the murders committed at the Oxford Apartments, Dietz explained that Dahmer occasionally viewed scenes from these films before searching for a victim. Dietz diagnosed Dahmer with substance use disorder, paraphilia, and schizotypal personality disorder.\nForensic psychiatrist George Palermo and clinical psychologist Samuel Friedman testified about Dahmer's pathology independently of either prosecution or defense. Palermo stated that Dahmer was motivated to commit murder by a \"pent-up aggression within himself. He killed those men because he wanted to kill the source of his homosexual attraction to them. In killing them, he killed what he hated in himself.\" Palermo concluded that Dahmer had a severe mixed personality disorder, with antisocial, obsessive-compulsive, sadistic, fetishistic, borderline and necrophilic features, but otherwise legally sane.\nFriedman testified that it was a longing for companionship that caused Dahmer to kill and testified that Dahmer was not psychotic. He described Dahmer as \"amiable, pleasant to be with, courteous, with a sense of humor, conventionally handsome, and charming in manner. He was, and still is, a bright young man.\" He diagnosed Dahmer with a personality disorder not otherwise specified featuring borderline, obsessive-compulsive, and sadistic traits.\nClosing arguments.\nThe trial lasted two weeks. On February 14, both attorneys delivered their closing arguments to the jury. Each attorney was allowed to speak for two hours. Defense attorney Gerald Boyle argued first. Repeatedly referring to the testimony of the mental health professionals\u2014almost all of whom had agreed Dahmer was afflicted with a mental disease\u2014Boyle argued that Dahmer's compulsive killings had been a result of \"a sickness he discovered, not chose\". Boyle portrayed Dahmer as a desperately lonely and profoundly sick individual \"so out of control he could not conform his conduct anymore\".\nFollowing the defense counsel's 75-minute closing argument, Michael McCann delivered his closing argument for the prosecution, describing Dahmer as a sane man, in full control of his actions, who simply strove to avoid detection. McCann described Dahmer as a calculating individual who killed to control his victims and retained their bodies \"merely to afford\" himself a prolonged period of sexual pleasure. McCann argued that by pleading guilty but insane to the charges, Dahmer was seeking to escape responsibility for his crimes.\nConviction.\nOn February 15, the court reconvened to hear the verdict: Dahmer was ruled to be sane and not suffering from a mental disorder at the time of each of the 15 murders for which he was tried, although in each count, two of the twelve jurors signified their dissent. Formal sentencing was postponed until February 17. On this date, Dahmer's attorney announced his client wished to address the court. Dahmer then approached a lectern and read from a statement prepared by himself and his defense as he faced the judge.\nIn this statement, Dahmer emphasized that he had never desired freedom following his arrest, and that he \"frankly\" wished for his own death. He further stressed that none of his murders had been motivated by hatred, that he understood that nothing he either said or did could \"undo the terrible harm\" he had caused to the families of his victims and the city of Milwaukee, and that he and his doctors believed his criminal behavior had been motivated by mental disorders. Dahmer added that this medical knowledge had given him \"some peace\", and that although he understood that society would never forgive him, he hoped God would. Dahmer closed his statement with: \"I know my time in prison will be terrible, but I deserve whatever I get because of what I have done. Thank you, your honor, and I am prepared for your sentence, which I know will be the maximum. I ask for no consideration.\" He then returned to his seat to await formal sentencing.\nDahmer was then sentenced to life imprisonment plus ten years upon the first two counts. The remaining thirteen counts carried a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment plus seventy years. The death penalty was not an option for Judge Gram to consider at the penalty phase, as Wisconsin had abolished capital punishment in 1853.\nUpon hearing of Dahmer's sentencing, his father Lionel and stepmother Shari requested to be allowed a ten-minute private meeting with their son before he was transferred to the Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, to begin his sentence. This request was granted, and the trio exchanged hugs and well-wishes before Dahmer was escorted away.\nThree months after his conviction in Milwaukee, Dahmer was extradited to Ohio to be tried for the murder of his first victim, Steven Hicks. In a court hearing lasting just 45 minutes, Dahmer again pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to a 16th term of life imprisonment on May 1, 1992.\nImprisonment.\nUpon sentencing, Dahmer was transferred to the Columbia Correctional Institution. For the first year of his incarceration, Dahmer was placed in solitary confinement due to concerns for his physical safety should he come into contact with fellow inmates. He received ample correspondence from individuals across the world, with several individuals donating money which he spent on items such as cassette recordings, stationery, cigarettes, and magazines. Upon Dahmer's request, after one year in solitary confinement, he was transferred to a less secure unit, where he was assigned a two-hour daily work detail cleaning the toilet block. This work detail later expanded to include cleaning the prison gymnasium.\nShortly after completing his lengthy confessions in 1991, Dahmer had requested to Detective Murphy that he be given a copy of the Bible. This request was granted and Dahmer gradually devoted himself to Christianity and became a born-again Christian. On his father's urging, he also read creationist books from the Institute for Creation Research. In May 1994, Dahmer was baptized by Roy Ratcliff, a minister in the Church of Christ and a graduate of Oklahoma Christian University whom he had met on April 20. This service was conducted in the prison whirlpool.\nFollowing Dahmer's baptism, Ratcliff visited him every week. The two regularly discussed the prospect of death, and Ratcliff later divulged that, in the months prior to his murder, Dahmer had questioned whether he was sinning against God by continuing to live. Referring to his crimes in a 1994 interview with Stone Phillips on \"Dateline NBC\", Dahmer had stated: \"If a person doesn't think that there is a God to be accountable to, then what's the point of trying to modify your behavior to keep it within acceptable ranges? That's how I thought anyway.\"\nOn July 3, 1994, a fellow inmate, Osvaldo Durruthy, attempted to slash Dahmer's throat with a razor embedded in a toothbrush as Dahmer sat in the prison chapel after the weekly church service was concluded. Dahmer received superficial wounds and was not seriously hurt in this incident. According to Dahmer's family, he had long been ready to die, and accepted any punishment which he might endure in prison. In addition to his father and stepmother maintaining regular contact, Dahmer's mother, Joyce, also maintained regular contact with her son. Prior to his arrest, the two had not seen each other since Christmas 1983. Joyce related that in her weekly phone calls, whenever she expressed concerns for her son's physical well-being, Dahmer responded with comments to the effect of: \"It doesn't matter, Mom. I don't care if something happens to me.\"\nDeath.\nOn the morning of November 28, 1994, Dahmer left his cell to conduct his assigned work detail. Accompanying him were two fellow inmates, Jesse Anderson and Christopher Scarver. The trio were left unsupervised in the showers of the prison gym for approximately 20 minutes. At approximately 8:10\u00a0a.m. Dahmer was discovered on the floor of the bathrooms of the gym with extreme head wounds; he had been severely bludgeoned about the head and face with a metal bar. His head had also been repeatedly struck against the wall in the assault. Although Dahmer was still alive and was rushed to a nearby hospital, he was pronounced dead one hour later. Anderson had been beaten with the same instrument; he died from his wounds two days later.\nScarver, who was serving a life sentence for a murder committed in 1990, informed authorities he had first attacked Dahmer with the metal bar as Dahmer was cleaning a staff locker room, before attacking Anderson as Anderson cleaned an inmate locker room. According to Scarver, Dahmer did not yell or make any noise as he was attacked. Immediately after attacking both men, Scarver, who was thought to be schizophrenic, returned to his cell and informed a prison guard: \"God told me to do it. Jesse Anderson and Jeffrey Dahmer are dead.\" Scarver was adamant he had not planned the attacks in advance, although he later divulged to investigators he had concealed the 20-inch iron bar used to kill both men in his clothing shortly before the killings. According to Scarver, Dahmer's final words were: \"I don't care if I live or die. Go ahead and kill me.\"\nUpon learning of his death, Dahmer's mother Joyce responded angrily to the media: \"Now is everybody happy? Now that he's bludgeoned to death, is that good enough for everyone?\" The response of the families of Dahmer's victims was mixed: some celebrated the news, while others were saddened. Catherine Lacy, the mother of victim Oliver Lacy, remarked: \"The hurt is worse now, because he's not suffering like we are.\" The district attorney who prosecuted Dahmer cautioned against turning Scarver into a folk hero, saying that Dahmer's death was still murder. On May 15, 1995, Scarver was sentenced to two additional terms of life imprisonment for the murders of Dahmer and Anderson.\nDahmer had stated in his will that he wished for no services to be conducted and that he wished to be cremated. In September 1995, Dahmer's body was cremated, and his ashes divided between his parents. Owing to a disagreement between his parents as to whether Dahmer's brain should be retained for medical research, this organ was initially retained, but later cremated in December 1995.\nAftermath.\nOn August 5, 1991, as the nature and scale of Dahmer's crimes initially came to light, a candlelight vigil to celebrate and heal the Milwaukee community was attended by more than 400 people. Present at the vigil were community leaders, gay rights activists, and family members of several of Dahmer's victims. Organizers stated the purpose of the vigil was to enable Milwaukeeans to \"share their feelings of pain and anger over what happened\".\nDahmer's murders were committed at a time of heightened racial tension in Milwaukee. A professor of community studies at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee, Walter Farrell, later stated race relations in the city had been \"in a state of disrepair for nearly a decade\" at the time of Dahmer's arrest. In an August 1991 interview given to the \"Christian Science Monitor\", Farrell stated that news of the murders, as well as the conduct of Milwaukee police officers John Balcerzak and Joseph Gabrish with regards to victim Konerak Sinthasomphone, exacerbated and highlighted racial tensions within the city.\nMilwaukee's gay scene was generally underground and transient in nature at the time of Dahmer's murders, with many sexually active gay men using aliases. Many in the city's gay community were nervous of the intentions of others after the extent of Dahmer's murders became known, although the fear and distrust generated by Dahmer's crimes was short-lived. As the 1990s progressed, the usage of aliases became less common among members of Milwaukee's gay community.\nThe Oxford Apartments at 924 North 25th Street, where Dahmer had killed twelve of his victims, were demolished in November 1992. The site is now a vacant lot. Alternate plans to convert the site into either a memorial garden, a playground, or to reconstruct new housing have failed to materialize.\nDahmer's estate was awarded to the families of eleven of his victims who had sued for damages. In 1996, Thomas Jacobson, a lawyer representing eight of the families, announced a planned auction of Dahmer's estate. Although victims' relatives stated the motivation was not greed, the announcement sparked controversy. A civic group, Milwaukee Civic Pride, was quickly established in an effort to raise the funds to purchase and destroy many of Dahmer's possessions. The group pledged $407,225, including a $100,000 gift by Milwaukee real estate developer Joseph Zilber, for purchase of Dahmer's estate; five of the eight families represented by Jacobson agreed to the terms, and Dahmer's possessions were subsequently destroyed and buried in an undisclosed Illinois landfill.\nIn 1995, the father of victim Jeremiah Weinberger filed a lawsuit against Dahmer's parole officer Donna Chester, alleging that Chester had failed to visit Dahmer's apartment as required while Dahmer was on probation, that she had failed to note Dahmer's deteriorating mental state and thus the likelihood of his re-engaging in criminal behavior, and had made no attempts to seek counseling for him. As such, Weinberger contended his son's death was due to the negligence of Chester and the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services. This lawsuit was dismissed in September 1995.\nIn 1994, Lionel published a book, \"A Father's Story\", and donated a portion of the proceeds from his book to the victims' families. Most of the families showed support for Lionel and Shari, although three families subsequently sued Lionel: two for using their names in the book without obtaining prior consent, and a third family\u2014that of Steven Hicks\u2014filing a wrongful death suit against Lionel, Shari, and former wife Joyce, citing parental negligence as the cause for the claim.\nLionel Dahmer lived with his second wife, Shari, until her death in January 2023. He died of natural causes on December 5, 2023. Both refused to change their surname and professed their love of Dahmer in spite of his crimes.\nJoyce Flint died of cancer on November 27, 2000. Prior to her death, she had attempted suicide on at least one occasion. Dahmer's younger brother, David, changed his surname and lives in anonymity.\nVictims.\nJeffrey Dahmer killed seventeen young men between 1978 and 1991. Twelve were killed in his North 25th Street apartment. Three victims were murdered and dismembered at his grandmother's West Allis residence. His first and second victims were murdered at his parents' home in Ohio and at the Ambassador Hotel in Milwaukee, respectively. A total of fourteen of Dahmer's victims were from various ethnic minority backgrounds, with nine victims being black. Dahmer was adamant that the race of his victims was incidental to him and that it was the body form of a potential victim that attracted his attention. These contentions have been supported via an independent forensic specialists' study of Dahmer's victim selection, the anthropological analysis of which revealed his victims shared a \"morphological similarity\" and suggesting Dahmer was \"psychologically attracted to a certain anthropometric body type\".\nMost of Dahmer's victims were killed by strangulation after being drugged with sedatives. His first victim was killed by a combination of bludgeoning and strangulation and his second victim was battered to death, with one further victim killed in 1990, Ernest Miller, dying of a combination of shock and blood loss due to his carotid artery being cut. Four of Dahmer's victims killed in 1991 had holes bored into their skulls through which Dahmer injected hydrochloric acid or, later, boiling water, into their frontal lobes in an attempt to induce a permanent, submissive, unresistant state. This proved fatal, although on each occasion this was not Dahmer's intention.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Cotten achieved prominence on Broadway, starring in the original stage productions of \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1939) and \"Sabrina Fair\" (1953). He gained worldwide fame for his collaborations with Orson Welles on films \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942), and \"Journey into Fear\" (1943). Cotten starred in the latter and was also credited with the screenplay.\nCotten became one of the leading Hollywood actors of the 1940s, appearing in films such as \"Shadow of a Doubt\" (1943); \"Gaslight\" (1944); \"Love Letters\" (1945); \"Duel in the Sun\" (1946); \"The Farmer's Daughter\" (1947); \"Portrait of Jennie\" (1948), for which he won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor; \"The Third Man\" (1949), alongside Welles; and \"Niagara\" (1953). One of his final films was Michael Cimino's \"Heaven's Gate\" (1980).\nFilm critics and media outlets have cited him as one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.\nEarly life.\nJoseph Cheshire Cotten Jr. was born on May 15, 1905, in Petersburg, Virginia, United States, the first of three sons born to Joseph Cheshire Cotten Sr., an assistant postmaster, and Sally Willson Cotten. He had two brothers, Whitworth W. \"Whit\" and Samuel W. Cotten. Both were engineers. Cotten grew up in the Tidewater region and showed an aptitude for drama and a gift for storytelling.\nIn 1923, when Cotten was 18, his family arranged for him to receive private lessons at the Hickman School of Expression in Washington, D.C., and underwrote his expenses. Cotten served in the First Motion Picture Unit of the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II.\nCotten earned spending money playing professional football on Sundays, for $25 a quarter. After graduation, he earned enough money as a lifeguard at Wilcox Lake to pay back his family's loan, with interest. He moved to Miami in 1925 and worked as an advertising salesman for \"The Miami Herald\" at $35 a week. He started performing at the Miami Civic Theatre, and worked there for five years, also reviewing the shows for the \"Herald\".\nCareer.\n1932\u20131939: Broadway and film debuts.\nCotten moved to New York and went to work for David Belasco as an assistant stage manager. He understudied Melvyn Douglas in \"Tonight or Never\" then took over Douglas' role for the Copley Theatre in Boston, where he worked on over 30 plays. Cotten struggled to find work in the depression so turned to modeling under the Walter Thornton Model Agency and acting in industrial films. He also performed on radio. Cotten made his Broadway debut in 1932 in \"Absent Friends\" which ran for 88 performances. He followed it with \"Jezebel\" (1933), staged by Katherine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic, which only had a short run. He was in \"Loose Moments\" which ran for 8 performances.\nIn 1934, Cotten met and became friends with Orson Welles, a fellow cast member on CBS Radio's \"The American School of the Air\". Welles regarded Cotten as a brilliant comic actor, and gave him the starring role in his Federal Theatre Project farce, \" Horse Eats Hat\" (September 26 \u2013 December 5, 1936). Cotten was sure that \"Horse Eats Hat\" won him the notice of his future Broadway co-star, Katharine Hepburn. Cotten said Welles later told him \"You're very lucky to be tall and thin and have curly hair. You can also move about the stage without running into the furniture. But these are fringe assets, and I'm afraid you'll never make it as an actor. But as a star, I think you well might hit the jackpot.\"\nIn 1937, Cotten became an inaugural member of Welles's Mercury Theatre company, starring in its Broadway productions \"Caesar\" as Publius; it ran for 157 performances. He followed it with \"The Shoemaker's Holiday\" (1938) and \"Danton's Death\" (1938) for Welles. Cotten also performed in radio dramas presented on \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" and \"The Campbell Playhouse\". That same year Cotten made his film debut in the Welles-directed short, \"Too Much Johnson\" (1938), a comedy that was intended to complement the aborted 1938 Mercury stage production of William Gillette's 1894 play. The film was never screened in public and was lost until 2008 (and then screened in 2013 at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival).\nCotten returned to Broadway in 1939, creating the role of C. K. Dexter Haven opposite Katharine Hepburn's Tracy Lord in the original production of Philip Barry's \"The Philadelphia Story\". The play ran for 417 performances at the Shubert Theatre, and in the months before its extensive national tour a film version was to be made by MGM. Cotten went to Hollywood, but discovered there that his stage success in \"The Philadelphia Story\" translated to, in the words of his agent Leland Hayward, \"spending a solid year creating the Cary Grant role.\" Hayward suggested that they call Cotten's good pal, Orson Welles. \"He's been making big waves out here\", Hayward said. \"Maybe nobody in Hollywood ever heard of the Shubert Theatre in New York, but everybody certainly knows about the Mercury Theatre in New York.\"\n1940\u20131949: Leading film roles.\n\"Citizen Kane\" (1941).\nAfter the success of Welles's \"War of the Worlds\" 1938 Halloween radio broadcast, Welles gained a unique contract with RKO Pictures. The two-picture deal promised full creative control for the young director below an agreed budget limit, and Welles's intention was to feature the Mercury Players in his productions. Shooting had still not begun on a Welles film after a year, but after a meeting with writer Herman J. Mankiewicz Welles had a suitable project.\nIn mid-1940, filming began on \"Citizen Kane\", portraying the life of a press magnate (played by Welles) who starts out as an idealist but eventually turns into a corrupt, lonely old man. The film featured Cotten prominently in the role of Kane's best friend Jedediah Leland, eventually a drama critic for one of Kane's papers.\nWhen released on May 1, 1941, \"Citizen Kane\" \u2013 based in part on the life of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst\u2013 did not do much business at theaters; Hearst owned numerous major newspapers, and forbade them to carry advertisements for the film. Nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1942, the film won only for Best Screenplay, for Mankiewicz and Welles. \"Citizen Kane\" launched the film careers of the Mercury Players, including Agnes Moorehead (who played Kane's mother), Ruth Warrick (Kane's first wife), and Ray Collins (Kane's political opponent). However, Cotten was the only one of the four to find major success as a lead in Hollywood outside of \"Citizen Kane\"; Moorehead and Collins became successful character film actors. Moorehead starred in Bewitched and Warrick spent decades in a career in daytime television, specifically All My Children.\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\", in an otherwise mixed review of the film, said that \"Cotten's work is vital and distinctive ... He is an important 'find.'\" Alexander Korda hired him to play Merle Oberon's leading man in \"Lydia\" (1941). \"I didn't care about the movies, really\", Cotten said later. \"I was tall. I had curly hair. I could talk. It was easy to do.\"\n\"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942).\nCotten starred in Welles's adaptation and production of \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942). After the commercial disappointment of \"Citizen Kane\", RKO was apprehensive about the new film, and after poor preview responses, cut it by nearly an hour before its release. Though at points the film appeared disjointed, it was well received by critics. Despite the critical accolades Cotten received for his performance, he was again snubbed by the academy.\n\"Journey into Fear\" (1943).\nCotten was cast in the World War II spy thriller \"Journey into Fear\" (1943) based on the novel by Eric Ambler. It was originally scripted by Ben Hecht but Welles, who was supervising, disliked it, and rewrote it with Cotten. Released by RKO, the Mercury production was directed by Norman Foster. It was a collaborative effort due to the difficulties shooting the film and the pressures related to Welles' imminent departure to South America to begin work on \"It's All True\".\nAlfred Hitchcock cast Cotten as a charming serial killer in \"Shadow of a Doubt\" (1943). It was made for Universal Pictures, for whom Cotten then appeared in \"Hers to Hold\" (1943), as Deanna Durbin's leading man.\nAfter Welles's return, he and Cotten co-produced \"The Mercury Wonder Show\" for members of the U.S. armed services. Opening August 3, 1943, the all-star magic and variety show was presented in a tent at 9000 Cahuenga Boulevard in Hollywood. Featured were Welles (Orson the Magnificent), Cotten (Jo-Jo the Great), Rita Hayworth (forced to quit by Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn and replaced by Marlene Dietrich), Agnes Moorehead (Calliope Aggie) and others. Tickets were free to servicemen, and more than 48,000 of them had seen show by September 1943.\nIn late 1943, Cotten visited Welles's office and said that producer David O. Selznick wanted to make two or three films with him, but that he wanted him under his own contract. Welles then tore up Cotten's contract with Mercury Productions, saying, \"He can do more for you than I can. Good luck!\" Cotten signed a long-term deal with Selznick. Selznick loaned out Cotten and Ingrid Bergman to MGM for the thriller \"Gaslight\" (1944), which was a major hit. Selznick then put Cotten in the wartime drama \"Since You Went Away\" (1944) alongside Claudette Colbert, Jennifer Jones and Shirley Temple, which was another major success.\nSelznick followed this up by teaming Cotten with Ginger Rogers and Temple in \"I'll Be Seeing You\" (1945), another melodrama. Hal Wallis borrowed Cotten and Jones to make \"Love Letters\" (1945). Exhibitors voted him the 17th most popular star in the United States in 1945. Selznick used Cotten, Jennifer Jones and Gregory Peck in \"Duel in the Sun\" (1946), an epic Western that was hugely popular at the box office.\nDore Schary, who had worked for Selznick, went to run RKO and hired Cotten for \"The Farmer's Daughter\" (1947), where he was Loretta Young's leading man. Cotten then made \"Portrait of Jennie\" (1948) for Selznick, co starring with Jones; Cotten played a melancholy artist who becomes obsessed with a girl who might have died many years before. His performance won Cotten the International Prize for Best Actor at the 1949 Venice International Film Festival.\n\"The Third Man\" (1949).\nCotten was reunited with Welles in Carol Reed's \"The Third Man\" (1949), produced by Korda and Selznick. Cotten portrays a writer of pulp fiction who travels to postwar Vienna to meet his friend Harry Lime (Welles). When he arrives, he is told that Lime has died. Determined to prove to the police that his friend was murdered, he uncovers an even darker secret. Years later, Cotten would recall that \"Orson Welles lists \"Citizen Kane\" as his best film, Alfred Hitchcock opts for \"Shadow of a Doubt\", and Sir Carol Reed chose \"The Third Man\" \u2013 and I'm in all of them.\"\nCotten then reunited with Hitchcock and Ingrid Bergman in \"Under Capricorn\" (1949) as an Australian landowner with a shady past; it was a box office disappointment. So too was \"Beyond the Forest\" (1949) with Bette Davis at Warner Bros.\n1950\u20131969: Established actor.\nCotten co-starred with Joan Fontaine in \"September Affair\" (1950) for Hal Wallis. Selznick loaned him to 20th Century Fox for the dark Civil War Western \"Two Flags West\" (1950), then to RKO for \"Walk Softly, Stranger\" (1950, shot in 1948) which reunited him with Alida Valli from \"The Third Man\". It was a flop. At Fox he did \"Half Angel\" (1951) with Young, then did another with Wallis at Paramount, \"Peking Express\" (1951) and went to MGM for \"The Man with a Cloak\" (1951) with Barbara Stanwyck. He had a cameo in Welles' \"Othello\" (1951).\nCotten did a Western at Universal, \"Untamed Frontier\" (1953), during the filming of which he was injured. He did a thriller for Andrew L. Stone, \"The Steel Trap\" (1952), which reunited him with Teresa Wright from \"Shadow of a Doubt\". At Fox he was in the Marilyn Monroe vehicle \"Niagara\" (1953), after James Mason turned down the role. He narrated \"Egypt by Three\" (1953) and was reunited with Stone in \"A Blueprint for Murder\" (1953).\nOn the stage in 1953, Cotten created the role of Linus Larrabee Jr. in the original Broadway production of \"Sabrina Fair\", opposite Margaret Sullavan. The production ran from November 11, 1953, until August 21, 1954, and was the basis of the Billy Wilder film \"Sabrina\", which starred Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn. He and Sullavan appeared in a TV production of \"State of the Union\" for \"Producers' Showcase,\" directed by Arthur Penn.\nCotten made \"Special Delivery\" (1955) in West Germany and appeared in a TV adaptation of \"Broadway\" for \"The Best of Broadway\" (1955), directed by Franklin J. Schaffner. He appeared in episodes of several TV anthology series, a popular format of the era, including \"Celebrity Playhouse\", \"The Ford Television Theatre\", \"Star Stage\", \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" (three episodes) and \"General Electric Theater\".\nIn 1955, Cotten hosted \"The 20th Century Fox Hour\" on television. In 1956, he introduced and occasionally starred in his own anthology NBC series, \"On Trial\". Because it was popularly known as \"The Joseph Cotten Show\", it was retitled mid-run to \"The Joseph Cotten Show: On Trial\". It ran for 41 episodes through 1959, with Cotten appearing in at least 20.\nHe returned to features with \"The Bottom of the Bottle\" (1956), \"The Killer Is Loose\" (1957) and \"The Halliday Brand\" (1957). He guest-starred on \"Jane Wyman Presents The Fireside Theatre\", \"Telephone Time\", \"Playhouse 90\", \"Schlitz Playhouse\", \"Zane Grey Theater\", \"Suspicion\" and \"Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse\". He made a cameo appearance in Welles's \"Touch of Evil\" (1958) and a starring role in the film adaptation of Jules Verne's \"From the Earth to the Moon\" (1958). Cotten had another success on Broadway when he appeared in \"Once More, With Feeling\" (1958\u201360), which ran for 263 performances. For the third time, Cotten was in a Broadway hit but did not reprise his role in the film version; Yul Brynner played the part on screen.\nCotten had a supporting role in the films \"The Angel Wore Red\" (1960) and \"The Last Sunset\" (1961), and guest-starred on \"The DuPont Show with June Allyson\", \"Checkmate\", \"The Barbara Stanwyck Show\", \"Bus Stop\", \"Theatre '62\" (an adaptation of Hitchcock's \"Notorious\"), \"Dr. Kildare\", \"Wagon Train\" and \"Saints and Sinners\".\nCotten returned to Broadway to appear in \"Calculated Risk\" (1962\u201363), which ran for 221 performances and meant he had to turn down a role in a film \"Harrigan's Halo\". He guest starred on \"The Great Adventure\" and \"77 Sunset Strip\" and appeared in the pilot for \"Alexander the Great\" (1963).\nAfter some time away from film, Cotten returned in the horror classic \"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte\" (1964) for Aldrich, with Bette Davis, Olivia de Havilland and Agnes Moorehead. Cotten was top billed in \"The Great Sioux Massacre\" (1965) and \"The Tramplers\" (1965), \"Brighty of the Grand Canyon\" (1966), \"The Cruel Ones\" (1967), \"Some May Live\" (1967) and \"Gangsters '70\" (1968). He took supporting roles in \"The Money Trap\" (1965) and \"The Oscar\" (1966).\nHe guest starred on \"Cimarron Strip\", \"Ironside\" and \"Journey to the Unknown\" and had a support role in \"Jack of Diamonds\" (1967). He had the lead in \"White Comanche\" (1968) and \"Latitude Zero\" (1969) (shot in Japan with his wife) and supported in the TV movies \"The Lonely Profession\" (1969) and \"Cutter's Trail\" (1970). He also appeared as himself on the \"Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In\" (1968) variety show.\n1970\u20131981: Later and final roles.\nCotten appeared in \"The Name of the Game\", \"It Takes a Thief\", \"NET Playhouse\", \"The Grasshopper\" (1970), \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\", \"The Virginian\", \"Assault on the Wayne\" (1971), \"Do You Take This Stranger?\" (1971), \"City Beneath the Sea\" (1971), \"The Abominable Dr. Phibes\" (1971), \"Lady Frankenstein\" (1971) and \"The Screaming Woman\" (1972) with de Havilland.\nHe had lead roles in \"Doomsday Voyage\" (1972), \"Baron Blood\" (1972), and \"The Scopone Game\" (1973) and was in \"The Devil's Daughter\" (1973), \"The Streets of San Francisco\", \"Soylent Green\" (1973), \"A Delicate Balance\" (1973), \"The Rockford Files\", \"Syndicate Sadists\" (1975), \"The Timber Tramps\" (1975), \"The Lindbergh Kidnapping Case\" (1976), \"A Whisper in the Dark\" (1976), \"Origins of the Mafia\" (1976), \"Twilight's Last Gleaming\" (1977) for Aldrich, \"Airport '77\", \"Aspen\" (1977), \"The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries\", \"Last In, First Out\" (1978), \"Caravans\" (1978), \"The Perfect Crime\" (1978), \"Island of the Fishmen\" (1979), \"Concorde Affaire '79\" (1979), \"\" (1979), \"Churchill and the Generals\" (1979), \"Tales of the Unexpected\" and \"Fantasy Island\".\nCotten later admitted, \"I was in a lot of junk. I get nervous when I don't work.\"\nCotten's final performances include in George Bower's supernatural horror film \"The Hearse\" (1980), the ABC television movie \"Casino\" (1980), Michael Cimino's \"Heaven's Gate\" (1980), multiple episodes of \"The Love Boat\" (1981), \"The Survivor\" (1981), shot in Australia and \"Delusion\" (1981).\nPersonal life.\nCotten's first wife Lenore Kipp died of leukemia in early 1960. He adopted Kipp's daughter, Judith Lenore LaMonte, from Kipp's previous marriage. He married British actress Patricia Medina on October 20, 1960, in Beverly Hills at the home of David O. Selznick and Jennifer Jones. He bought a historic 1935 home in the Mesa neighborhood of Palm Springs, California, where he and his wife lived from 1985 to 1992.\nIn 1961, Cotten was admitted to the Society of the Cincinnati in North Carolina based on his descent from Captain Hudson Whitaker, Seventh Regiment, North Carolina Continental Line. He held Captain Whitaker's hereditary seat until his death in 1994.\nIllness and death.\nOn June 8, 1981, Cotten experienced a heart attack followed by a stroke that affected his brain's speech center. He began years of therapy that restored his ability to speak. As he began to recover, he and Welles talked on the phone each week for hours.\nIn 1990, Cotten's larynx was removed because of cancer. He died on February 6, 1994, of pneumonia at the age of 88. He was buried at Blandford Cemetery in Petersburg, Virginia.\nAccolades and legacy.\nAt the 10th Venice International Film Festival, Cotten was awarded the Volpi Cup for Best Actor for his performance in the film \"Portrait of Jennie\" (1948). He was also given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.\nCotten was portrayed by Tim Robbins in the 1985 TV film \"Malice in Wonderland\", by James Tupper in the film \"Me and Orson Welles\" (2008) and by Matthew Glave in the television series \"Feud\" (2017), which depicts the filming of \"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16224", "revid": "40414428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16224", "title": "Jonah", "text": "Biblical and Quranic prophet\nJonah the son of Amittai or Jonas ( , lit.\u2009'dove') is a Jewish prophet from Gath-hepher in the Northern Kingdom of Israel around the 8th century BCE according to the Hebrew Bible. He is the central figure of the Book of Jonah, one of the minor prophets, which details his reluctance in delivering the judgment of God to the city of Nineveh (near present-day Mosul) in the Neo-Assyrian Empire. After he is swallowed by a large sea creature () and then released, he returns to the divine mission.\nIn Judaism, the story of Jonah represents the teaching of repentance in Judaism, the ability to repent to God for forgiveness. In the New Testament of Christianity, Jesus calls himself \"greater than Jonah\" and promises the Pharisees \"the sign of Jonah\" when referring to his resurrection. Early Christian interpreters viewed Jonah as a \"type\" of Jesus. Jonah in Islam is regarded as a prophet and the narrative of Jonah appears in a surah of the Quran named after him, Y\u016bnus.\nMany modern Bible scholars suggest the Book of Jonah is fictional, and at least partially satirical. Most scholars consider the Book of Jonah to have been composed long after the events it describes due to its use of words and motifs exclusive to postexilic Aramaic sources. The character of Jonah son of Amittai may have been based on the historical prophet of the same name who prophesied during the reign of King Amaziah of Judah, as mentioned in 2 Kings.\nAlthough the creature that swallowed Jonah is often depicted in art and culture as a whale, the Hebrew text uses the phrase \"large fish\". In the 17th century and early 18th century, the species of the fish that swallowed Jonah was the subject of speculation by naturalists, who interpreted the story as an account of a historical incident. Some modern scholars of folklore, on the other hand, note similarities between Jonah and other legendary religious figures, like the Indian yogi Matsyendranatha \"Lord of the Fishes\", the Sumerian king Gilgamesh, and the Greek hero Jason.\nBook of Jonah.\nJonah is the central character in the Book of Jonah, in which God commands him to go to the city of Nineveh to prophesy against it \"for their great wickedness is come up before me\", but Jonah instead attempts to flee from \"the presence of the Lord\" by going to Jaffa (sometimes transliterated as \"Joppa\" or \"Joppe\"). He sets sail for Tarshish. A huge storm arises and the sailors, realizing that it is no ordinary storm, cast lots and discover that Jonah is to blame. Jonah admits this and says that if he is thrown overboard, the storm will cease. The sailors refuse to do this and continue rowing, but all their efforts fail, and they eventually throw Jonah overboard. As a result, the storm calms and the sailors offer sacrifices to God.\nAfter being cast from the ship, Jonah is swallowed by a large fish, within the belly of which he remains for three days and three nights. While in the great fish, Jonah prays to God in his affliction and commits to giving thanks and to paying what he has vowed. God commands the fish to vomit Jonah out.\nGod again commands Jonah to travel to Nineveh and prophesy to its inhabitants. This time he travels there and enters the city, crying, \"In forty days Nineveh shall be overthrown.\" After Jonah has walked across Nineveh, the people begin to believe his word and proclaim a fast. The king of Nineveh puts on sackcloth and sits in ashes, making a proclamation which decrees fasting, the wearing of sackcloth, prayer and repentance. God sees their repentant hearts and spares the city at that time. The entire city is humbled and broken, with the people (and even the livestock) wearing sackcloth and ashes.\nDispleased by this, Jonah refers to his earlier flight to Tarshish while asserting that, since God is merciful, it was inevitable that God would turn from the threatened calamities. He leaves the city and makes a shelter, waiting to see whether or not the city will be destroyed. God causes a plant (in Hebrew a \"kikayon\") to grow over Jonah's shelter to give him some shade from the sun. Later, God causes a worm to bite the plant's root and it withers. Jonah, exposed to the full force of the sun, becomes faint and pleads for God to kill him.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But God said to Jonah: \"Do you have a right to be angry about the vine?\" And he said: \"I do. I am angry enough to die.\"But the LORD said: \"You have been concerned about this vine, though you did not tend it or make it grow. It sprang up overnight, and died overnight.But Nineveh has more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left, and many cattle as well. Should I not be concerned about that great city?\"\u2014\u200a\nReligious views.\nIn Judaism.\nThe Book of Jonah (Yonah \u05d9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4) is one of the twelve minor prophets included in the Hebrew Bible. According to one tradition, Jonah was the boy brought back to life by Elijah the prophet in 1 Kings. Another tradition holds that he was the son of the woman of Shunem brought back to life by Elisha in 2 Kings and that he is called the \"son of Amittai\" (\"Truth\") due to his mother's recognition of Elijah's identity as a prophet in 1 Kings. The Book of Jonah is read every year, in its original Hebrew and in its entirety, on Yom Kippur \u2013 the Day of Atonement \u2013 as the Haftarah at the afternoon mincha prayer. According to Rabbi Eliezer, the fish that swallowed Jonah was created in the primordial era and the inside of its mouth was like a synagogue; the fish's eyes were like windows and a pearl inside its mouth provided further illumination.\nAccording to the Midrash, while Jonah was inside the fish, the fish told him that its life was nearly over because soon the Leviathan would eat them both. Jonah promised the fish that he would save them. Following Jonah's directions, the fish swam up alongside the Leviathan and Jonah threatened to leash the Leviathan by its tongue and let the other fish eat it. The Leviathan heard Jonah's threats, saw that he was circumcised, and realized that he was protected by the Lord, so it fled in terror, leaving Jonah and the fish alive. \nThe medieval Jewish scholar and rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra (1092\u20131167) argued against any literal interpretation of the Book of Jonah, stating that the \"experiences of all the prophets except Moses were visions, not actualities.\" The later scholar Isaac Abarbanel (1437\u20131509), however, argued that Jonah could have easily survived in the belly of the fish for three days, because \"after all, fetuses live nine months without access to fresh air.\"\nTeshuva \u2013 the ability to repent and be forgiven by God \u2013 is a prominent idea in Jewish thought. This concept is developed in the Book of Jonah: Jonah, the son of truth (the name of his father \"Amitai\" in Hebrew means \"truth\"), refuses to ask the people of Nineveh to repent. He seeks the truth only, and not forgiveness. When forced to go, his call is heard loud and clear, and the people of Nineveh repent ecstatically, \"fasting, including the sheep\", and the Jewish text is critical of this. The Book of Jonah also highlights the sometimes unstable relationship between two religious needs: comfort and truth.\nTwelfth-century Jewish rabbi and explorer Petachiah of Regensburg visited Jonah's tomb during his visit to the Holy Land, and wrote: \"There is a beautiful palace built over it. Near it is a pleasure garden wherein all kinds of fruit are found. The keeper of the pleasure garden is a Gentile. Nevertheless, when Gentiles come there he gives them no fruit, but when Jews come he gives them a friendly reception, saying, Jonah, son of Amittai, was a Jew, therefore it is due to you to partake of what is his, and then gives to the Jews to eat thereof.\" Petachiah did not provide details about the exact location of the tomb.\nIn Christianity.\nIn the Book of Tobit.\nJonah is mentioned twice in the fourteenth chapter of the Vaticanus version of deuterocanonical Book of Tobit, the conclusion of which finds Tobit's son, Tobias, rejoicing at the news of Nineveh's destruction by Nebuchadnezzar and Ahasuerus in apparent fulfillment of Jonah's prophecy against the Assyrian capital. The Codex Sinaiticus version of the book, which is longer and aligns more closely with the Dead Sea Scrolls, refers to Nahum instead of Jonah, as well as Cyaxares instead of Nebuchadnezzar and Ahasuerus. This more reliable version of the story is the basis for most modern translations.\nIn the New Testament.\nIn the New Testament, Jonah is mentioned in the gospels of Matthew and Luke. In Matthew, Jesus makes a reference to Jonah when he is asked for a sign by some of the scribes and the Pharisees. Jesus says that the sign will be the sign of Jonah: Jonah's restoration after three days and three night inside the great fish prefigures his own resurrection.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;39He answered, \"A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. 40For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. 41The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here.\"\u2014\u200a\nIn Luke, Jesus makes a reference to Jonah in an eschatological prophecy, after a woman in the crowd suddenly exclaims, \"Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked\" (Luke 11:27 - King James Version):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;29And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, \"This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet. 30For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation. 31The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here. 32The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here. 33No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light. 34The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness. 35Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness. 36If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.\"\u2014\u200a\nJonah is regarded as a saint by a number of Christian denominations. His feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is on 21 September, according to the \"Martyrologium Romanum\". On the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar, Jonah's feast day is on 22 September (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian calendar; 22 September currently falls in October on the modern Gregorian calendar). In the Armenian Apostolic Church, moveable feasts are held in commemoration of Jonah as a single prophet and as one of the Twelve Minor Prophets. Jonah's mission to the Ninevites is commemorated by the Fast of Nineveh in Syriac and Oriental Orthodox Churches. Jonah is commemorated as a prophet in the Calendar of Saints of the Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church on 22 September.\nChristian theologians have traditionally interpreted Jonah as a type for Jesus Christ. Jonah being in swallowed by the giant fish was regarded as a foreshadowing of Jesus's crucifixion and Jonah emerging from the fish after three days was seen as a parallel for Jesus emerging from the tomb after three days. Saint Jerome equates Jonah with Jesus's more nationalistic side, and justifies Jonah's actions by arguing that \"Jonah acts thus as a patriot, not so much that he hates the Ninevites, as that he does not want to destroy his own people.\"\nPost-Biblical views.\nOther Christian interpreters, including Saint Augustine and Martin Luther, have taken a directly opposite approach, regarding Jonah as the epitome of envy and jealousness, which they regarded as inherent characteristics of the Jewish people. Luther likewise concludes that the \"kikayon\" (plant) represents Judaism, and that the worm which devours it represents Christ. Luther also questioned the idea that the Book of Jonah was ever intended as literal history, commenting that he found it hard to believe that anyone would have interpreted it as such if it were not in the Bible. Luther's antisemitic interpretation of Jonah remained the prevailing interpretation among German Protestants throughout early modern history. J. D. Michaelis comments that \"the meaning of the fable hits you right between the eyes\", and concludes that the Book of Jonah is a polemic against \"the Israelite people's hate and envy towards all the other nations of the earth.\" Albert Eichhorn was a strong supporter of Michaelis's interpretation.\nJohn Calvin and John Hooper regarded the Book of Jonah as a warning to all those who might attempt to flee from the wrath of God. While Luther had been careful to maintain that the Book of Jonah was not written by Jonah, Calvin declared that the Book of Jonah was Jonah's personal confession of guilt. Calvin sees Jonah's time inside the fish's belly as equivalent to the fires of Hell, intended to correct Jonah and set him on the path of righteousness. Also, unlike Luther, Calvin finds fault with all the characters in the story, describing the sailors on the boat as \"hard and iron-hearted, like Cyclops'\", the penitence of the Ninevites as \"untrained\", and the king of Nineveh as a \"novice\". Hooper, on the other hand, sees Jonah as the archetypal dissident and the ship he is cast out from as a symbol of the state. Hooper deplores such dissidents, decrying: \"Can you live quietly with so many Jonasses? Nay then, throw them into the sea!\" In the eighteenth century, German professors were forbidden from teaching that the Book of Jonah was anything other than a literal, historical account.\nIn Islam.\nQuran.\nJonah () is the title of the tenth chapter of the Quran. Y\u016bnus is traditionally viewed as highly important in Islam as a prophet who was faithful to God and delivered His messages. Jonah is the only one of Judaism's Twelve Minor Prophets to be named in the Quran. In and , Jonah is called Dhul-N\u016bn (; meaning \"The One of the Fish\"). In 4:163 and 6:86, he is referred to as \"an apostle of Allah\". Surah 37:139\u2013148 retells the full story of Jonah:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And verily, Jonah was among the messengers.&lt;br&gt;[Mention] when he ran away to the laden ship.&lt;br&gt;Then (to save it from sinking) he drew straws (with other passengers). He lost and was thrown overboard.&lt;br&gt;Then the whale engulfed him while he was blameworthy.&lt;br&gt;Had it not been that he (repented and) glorified Allah,&lt;br&gt;He would certainly have remained inside the Fish till the Day of Resurrection.&lt;br&gt;But We cast him onto the open (shore), (totally) worn out,&lt;br&gt;and caused a squash plant to grow over him.&lt;br&gt;We (later) sent him (back) to (his city of) at least one hundred thousand people,&lt;br&gt;And they believed, so We allowed them enjoyment for a while.\nThe Quran never mentions Jonah's father, but Muslim tradition teaches that Jonah was from the tribe of Benjamin and that his father was Amittai.\nHadiths.\nJonah is also mentioned in a few incidents during the lifetime of Muhammad. Quraysh sent their servant, Addas, to serve him grapes for sustenance. Muhammad asked Addas where he was from and the servant replied Nineveh. \"The town of Jonah the just, son of Amittai!\" Muhammad exclaimed. Addas was shocked because he knew that the pagan Arabs had no knowledge of the prophet Jonah. He then asked how Muhammad knew of this man. \"We are brothers\", Muhammad replied. \"Jonah was a Prophet of God and I, too, am a Prophet of God.\" Addas immediately accepted Islam and kissed the hands and feet of Muhammad.\nOne of the sayings attributed to Muhammad, in the collection of Imam Bukhari, says that Muhammad said \"One should not say that I am better than Jonah\". Umayya ibn Abi al-Salt, an older contemporary of Muhammad, taught that, had Jonah not prayed to Allah, he would have remained trapped inside the fish until Judgement Day, but, because of his prayer, Jonah \"stayed only a few days within the belly of the fish\".\nThe ninth-century Persian historian Al-Tabari records that, while Jonah was inside the fish, \"none of his bones or members were injured\". Al-Tabari also writes that Allah made the body of the fish transparent, allowing Jonah to see the \"wonders of the deep\" and that Jonah heard all the fish singing praises to Allah. Kisai Marvazi, a tenth-century poet, records that Jonah's father was seventy years old when Jonah was born and that he died soon afterwards, leaving Jonah's mother with nothing but a wooden spoon, which turned out to be a cornucopia.\nClaimed tombs.\nNineveh's current location is marked by excavations of five gates, parts of walls on four sides, and two large mounds: the hill of Kuyunjik and hill of Nabi Yunus. A mosque atop Nabi Yunus was dedicated to the prophet Jonah and contained a shrine, which was revered by both Muslims and Christians as the site of Jonah's tomb. The tomb was a popular pilgrimage site and a symbol of unity to Jews, Christians, and Muslims across the Middle East. On July 24, 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) destroyed the mosque containing the tomb as part of a campaign to destroy religious sanctuaries it deemed to be idolatrous. After Mosul was taken back from ISIL in January 2017, an ancient Assyrian palace built by Esarhaddon dating to around the first half of the 7th century BCE was discovered beneath the ruined mosque. ISIL had plundered the palace of items to sell on the black market, but some of the artifacts that were more difficult to transport still remained in place.\nOther reputed locations of Jonah's tomb include:\nScholarly interpretations.\nThe story of a man surviving after being swallowed by a whale or giant fish is classified in the catalogue of folktale types as ATU 1889G.\nHistoricity.\nMany Biblical scholars hold that the contents of the Book of Jonah are ahistorical. Although the prophet Jonah allegedly lived in the eighth century BCE, the Book of Jonah was written centuries later during the time of the Achaemenid Empire. The Hebrew used in the Book of Jonah shows strong influences from Aramaic and the cultural practices described in it match those of the Achaemenid Persians. Some scholars regard the Book of Jonah as an intentional work of parody or satire. If this is the case, then it was probably admitted into the canon of the Hebrew Bible by sages who misunderstood its satirical nature and mistakenly interpreted it as a serious prophetic work.\nJonah himself may have been a historical prophet; he is briefly mentioned in the Second Book of Kings:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath unto the sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD, the God of Israel, which He spoke by the hand of His servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath-hepher.\u2014\u200a\nIn a lecture delivered in 1978 and published in 1979, Assyriologist Donald Wiseman defended the plausibility of many aspects of the story, supporting \"the tradition that many features in the narrative exhibit an intimate and accurate knowledge of Assyria which could stem from an historical event as early as the eighth century B.C.\", concluding that \"the story of Jonah need not be considered as a late story or parable\".\nParodic elements.\nThe views expressed by Jonah in the Book of Jonah are a parody of views held by members of Jewish society at the time when it was written. The primary target of the satire may have been a faction whom Morton Smith calls \"Separationists\", who believed that God would destroy those who disobeyed him, that sinful cities would be obliterated, and that God's mercy did not extend to those outside the Abrahamic covenant. McKenzie and Graham remark that \"Jonah is in some ways the most 'orthodox' of Israelite theologians \u2013 to make a theological point.\" Jonah's statements throughout the book are characterized by their militancy, but his name ironically means \"dove\", a bird which the ancient Israelites associated with peace.\nJonah's rejection of God's commands is a parody of the obedience of the prophets described in other Old Testament writings. The king of Nineveh's instant repentance parodies the rulers throughout the other writings of the Old Testament who disregard prophetic warnings, such as Ahab and Zedekiah. The readiness to worship God displayed by the sailors on the ship and the people of Nineveh contrasts ironically with Jonah's own reluctance, as does Jonah's greater love for \"kikayon\" providing him shade than for all the people in Nineveh.\nThe Book of Jonah also employs elements of literary absurdism; it exaggerates the size of the city of Nineveh to an implausible degree and incorrectly refers to the administrator of the city as a \"king\". According to scholars, no human could realistically survive for three days inside a fish, and the description of the livestock in Nineveh fasting alongside their owners is \"silly\".\nSome of these points are countered in the aforementioned lecture of Donald Wiseman.\nThe motif of a protagonist being swallowed by a giant fish or whale became a stock trope of later satirical writings. Similar incidents are recounted in Lucian of Samosata's \"A True Story\", which was written in the second century CE, and in the novel \"Baron Munchausen's Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia\", published by Rudolf Erich Raspe in 1785.\nThe fish.\nTranslation.\nThough art and culture often depicts Jonah's fish as a whale, the Hebrew text, as throughout scripture, refers to no marine species in particular, simply saying \"great fish\" or \"big fish\". While some biblical scholars suggest the size and habits of the great white shark correspond better to the representations of Jonah's experiences, normally an adult human is too large to be swallowed whole. The development of whaling from the 18th century onwards made it clear that most, if not all, species of whale are incapable of swallowing a human, leading to much controversy about the veracity of the biblical story of Jonah.\nIn Jonah 2:1 (1:17 in English translations), the Hebrew text reads \"dag gadol\" () or, in the Hebrew Masoretic Text, (), which means \"great fish\". The Septuagint translates this phrase into Greek as (), meaning \"huge fish\". In Greek mythology, the same word meaning \"fish\" (\"k\u00eatos\") is used to describe the sea monster slain by the hero Perseus that nearly devoured the Princess Andromeda. Jerome later translated this phrase as in his Latin Vulgate. He translated \"koilia k\u00e9tous\", however, as \"ventre ceti\" in Matthew 12:40: this second case occurs only in this verse of the New Testament.\nAt some point \"cetus\" became synonymous with \"whale\" (the study of whales is now called \"cetology\"). In his 1534 translation, William Tyndale translated the phrase in Jonah 2:1 as \"greate fyshe\" and the word \"k\u00e9tos\" (Greek) or (Latin) in Matthew 12:40 as \"whale\". Tyndale's translation was later incorporated into the Authorized Version of 1611. Since then, the \"great fish\" in Jonah 2 has been most often interpreted as a whale. In English some translations use the word \"whale\" for Matthew 12:40, while others use \"sea creature\" or \"big fish\".\nScientific speculation.\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, naturalists, interpreting the Jonah story as a historical account, became obsessed with trying to identify the exact species of the fish that swallowed Jonah. In the mid-nineteenth century, Edward Bouverie Pusey, professor of Hebrew at Oxford University, claimed that the Book of Jonah must have been authored by Jonah himself and argued that the fish story must be historically true, or else it would not have been included in the Bible. Pusey attempted to scientifically catalogue the fish, hoping to \"shame those who speak of the miracle of Jonah's preservation in the fish as a thing less credible than any of God's other miraculous doings\".\nThe debate over the fish in the Book of Jonah played a major role during Clarence Darrow's cross-examination of William Jennings Bryan at the Scopes trial in 1925. Darrow asked Bryan, \"When you read that ... the whale swallowed Jonah ... how do you literally interpret that?\". Bryan replied that he believed in \"a God who can make a whale and can make a man and make both of them do what He pleases.\" Bryan ultimately admitted that it was necessary to interpret the Bible, and is generally regarded as having come off looking like a \"buffoon\".\nThe largest of all whales \u2013 blue whales \u2013 are baleen whales which eat plankton; and \"it is commonly said that this species would be choked if it attempted to swallow a herring.\" The largest of all fishes \u2013 the whale shark \u2013 has a large mouth, but its throat is only four inches wide, with a sharp elbow or bend behind the opening, such that not even a human arm would be able to pass through it. Therefore, Jonah could not have been swallowed by a whale shark.\nSperm whales, however, appear to be a different matter: They regularly eat giant squid, so presumably one could swallow a human. Similar to a cow, sperm whales have four-chambered stomachs. The first chamber has no gastric juices but has muscular walls to crush its food. On the other hand, it is not possible to breathe inside the sperm whale's stomach because there is no air (but probably methane instead). A 2023 novel by Daniel Kraus explores the idea of a man surviving being swallowed by a sperm whale, but with an oxygen tank.\nCultural influence.\nIn Turkish, \"Jonah's fish\" (\"yunus bal\u0131\u011f\u0131\") is the term used for dolphins. A long-established expression among sailors uses the term \"a Jonah\" to mean a sailor/passenger whose presence on board brings bad luck and endangers the ship. Later, this meaning was extended to \"a person who carries a jinx, one who will bring bad luck to any enterprise.\"\nDespite its brevity, the Book of Jonah has been adapted numerous times in literature and in popular culture. In Herman Melville's \"Moby-Dick\" (1851), Father Mapple delivers a sermon on the Book of Jonah. Mapple asks why Jonah does not show remorse for disobeying God while he is inside of the fish. He concludes that Jonah admirably understands that \"his dreadful punishment is just.\" Carlo Collodi's \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" (1883) features the title character and his father Geppetto being swallowed by \"the Terrible Dogfish\", an allusion to the story of Jonah. Walt Disney's 1940 film adaptation of the novel retains this allusion. The story of Jonah was adapted into Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki's animated film \"\" (2002). In the film, Jonah (portrayed by Archibald Asparagus) is swallowed by a gargantuan whale.\nSuggested connections to legends.\n\"Epic of Gilgamesh\".\nJoseph Campbell suggests that the story of Jonah parallels a scene from the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", in which Gilgamesh obtains a plant from the bottom of the sea. In the Book of Jonah, a worm (in Hebrew , \"maggot\") bites the shade-giving plant's root causing it to wither; whereas in the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", Gilgamesh ties stones to his feet and plucks his plant from the floor of the sea. Once he returns to the shore, the rejuvenating plant is eaten by a serpent.\nJason (Greek mythology).\nCampbell also noted several similarities between the story of Jonah and that of Jason in Greek mythology. The Greek rendering of the name Jonah is \"Jonas\" (\u1f38\u03c9\u03bd\u1fb6\u03c2), which differs from \"Jason\" (\u1f38\u03ac\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd) only in the order of sounds \u2013 both \"o\"s are omegas suggesting that Jason may have been confused with Jonah. Gildas Hamel, drawing on the Book of Jonah and Greco-Roman sources \u2013 including Greek vases and the accounts of Apollonius of Rhodes, Gaius Valerius Flaccus and Orphic Argonautica \u2013 identifies a number of shared motifs, including the names of the heroes, the presence of a dove, the idea of \"fleeing\" like the wind and causing a storm, the attitude of the sailors, the presence of a sea-monster or dragon threatening the hero or swallowing him, and the form and the word used for the \"gourd\" (\"kikayon\"). Hamel takes the view that it was the Hebrew author who reacted to and adapted this mythological material to communicate his own quite different message.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The resulting ensemble of the loom and Jacquard machine is then called a Jacquard loom. The machine was patented by Joseph Marie Jacquard in 1804, based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen Basile Bouchon (1725), Jean Baptiste Falcon (1728), and Jacques Vaucanson (1740). The machine was controlled by a \"chain of cards\"; a number of punched cards laced together into a continuous sequence. Multiple rows of holes were punched on each card, with one complete card corresponding to one row of the design. \nBoth the Jacquard process and the necessary loom attachment are named after their inventor. This mechanism is probably one of the most important weaving innovations, as Jacquard shedding made possible the automatic production of unlimited varieties of complex pattern weaving. The term \"Jacquard\" is not specific or limited to any particular loom, but rather refers to the added control mechanism that automates the patterning. The process can also be used for patterned knitwear and machine-knitted textiles such as jerseys.\nThis use of replaceable punched cards to control a sequence of operations is considered an important step in the history of computing hardware, having inspired Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.\nHistory.\nTraditionally, figured designs were made on a drawloom. The heddles with warp ends to be pulled up were manually selected by a second operator, the draw boy, not the weaver. The work was slow and labour-intensive, and the complexity of the pattern was limited by practical factors.\nThe first prototype of a Jacquard-type loom was made in the second half of the 15th century by an Italian weaver from Calabria, Jean le Calabrais, who was invited to Lyon by Louis XI. He introduced a new kind of machine which was able to work the yarns faster and more precisely. Over the years, improvements to the loom were ongoing.\nAn improvement of the draw loom took place in 1725, when Basile Bouchon introduced the principle of applying a perforated band of paper. A continuous roll of paper was punched by hand, in sections, each of which represented one lash or tread, and the length of the roll was determined by the number of shots in each repeat of pattern. The Jacquard machine then evolved from this approach.\nJoseph Marie Jacquard saw that a mechanism could be developed for the production of sophisticated patterns. He possibly combined mechanical elements of other inventors, but certainly innovated. His machine was generally similar to Vaucanson's arrangement, but he made use of Jean-Baptiste Falcon's individual pasteboard cards and his square prism (or card \"cylinder\"): he is credited with having fully perforated each of its four sides, replacing Vaucanson's perforated \"barrel\". Jacquard's machine contained eight rows of needles and uprights, where Vaucanson had a double row. This modification enabled him to increase the figuring capacity of the machine. In his first machine, he supported the harness by knotted cords, which he elevated by a single trap board.\nOne of the chief advantages claimed for the Jacquard machine was that unlike previous damask-weaving machines, in which the figuring shed was usually drawn once for every four shots, with the new apparatus, it could be drawn on every shot, thus producing a fabric with greater definition of outline.\nJacquard's invention had a deep influence on Charles Babbage. In that respect, he is viewed by some authors as a precursor of modern computing technology.\nPrinciples of operation.\nAs shown in the diagram, the cards are fastened into a continuous chain (1) which passes over a square box. At each quarter rotation, a new card is presented to the Jacquard head which represents one row (one \"pick\" of the shuttle carrying the weft). The box swings from the right to the position shown and presses against the control rods (2). For each hole in the card, a rod passes through and is unmoved; where there is no hole, a rod is pushed to the left. Each rod acts upon a hook (3). When the rod is pushed in, the hook moves out of position to the left; a rod that is not pushed in leaves its hook in place. A beam (4) then rises under the hooks, and the hooks in the rest position are raised. The hooks that have been displaced are not moved by the beam. Each hook can have multiple cords (5). Each cord passes through a guide (6) and is attached to a corresponding heddle (7) and return weight (8). The heddles raise the warp to create the shed through which the shuttle carrying the weft will pass. A loom with a 400-hook head might have four threads connected to each hook, resulting in a fabric that is 1600 warp ends wide with four repeats of the weave going across.\nThe term \"Jacquard loom\" is somewhat inaccurate. It is the \"Jacquard head\" that adapts to a great many dobby looms that allow the weaving machine to then create the intricate patterns often seen in Jacquard weaving.\nJacquard-driven looms, although relatively common in the textile industry, are not as ubiquitous as dobby looms which are usually faster and much cheaper to operate. However, dobby looms are not capable of producing many different weaves from one warp. Modern jacquard machines are controlled by computers in place of the original punched cards and can have thousands of hooks.\nThe threading of a Jacquard machine is so labor-intensive that many looms are threaded only once. Subsequent warps are then tied into the existing warp with the help of a knotting robot which ties on each new thread individually. Even for a small loom with only a few thousand warp ends, the process of re-threading can take days.\nMechanical Jacquard devices.\nOriginally, Jacquard machines were mechanical, and the fabric design was stored on a series of punched cards which were joined to form a continuous chain. The Jacquards were often small and controlled relatively few warp ends. This required a number of repeats across the loom width. Larger capacity machines, or the use of multiple machines, allowed greater control with fewer repeats; hence, larger designs could be woven across the loom width.\nA factory must choose looms and shedding mechanisms to suit its commercial requirements. As a rule, greater warp control means greater expense. So it is not economical to purchase Jacquard machines if one can make do with a dobby mechanism. Beyond the capital expense, Jacquard machines cost more to maintain as they are complex, require highly-skilled operators, and use expensive systems to prepare designs for the loom. Thus, they are more likely to produce faults than dobby or cam shedding. Also, the looms will not run as quickly and down-time will increase because it takes time to change the continuous chain of cards when a design changes. It is best to weave larger batches with mechanical Jacquards.\nElectronic Jacquard machines.\nIn 1855, a Frenchman adapted the Jacquard mechanism to a system by which it could be worked by electro-magnets. There was significant interest, but trials were not successful, and the development was soon forgotten.\nBonas Textile Machinery NV launched the first successful electronic Jacquard at ITMA Milan in 1983. Although the machines were initially small, modern technology has allowed Jacquard machine capacity to increase significantly, and single end warp control can extend to more than 10,000 warp ends. This eliminates the need for repeats and symmetrical designs and invites almost infinite versatility. The computer-controlled machines significantly reduce the down time associated with changing punchcards, thereby allowing smaller batch sizes. However, electronic Jacquards are costly and may not be necessary in a factory weaving large batch sizes and smaller designs. Larger machines accommodating single-end warp control are very expensive and can only be justified when great versatility or very specialized designs are required. For example, they are an ideal tool to increase the ability and versatility of niche linen Jacquard weavers who remain active in Europe and the West, while most large batch commodity weaving has moved to low-cost production.\nLinen products associated with Jacquard weaving are linen damask napery, Jacquard apparel fabrics and damask bed linen. Jacquard weaving uses all sorts of fibers and blends of fibers, and it is used in the production of fabrics for many end uses. Jacquard weaving can also be used to create fabrics that have a Matelass\u00e9 or a brocade pattern.\nThe woven silk prayer book.\nA pinnacle of production using a Jacquard machine is a prayer book, woven in silk, entitled . All 58 pages of the prayer book were woven silk, made with a Jacquard machine using black and gray thread, at 160 threads per cm (400 threads per inch). The pages have elaborate borders with text and pictures of saints. According to book historian Michael Laird, an estimated 106,000 to 500,000 punchcards were necessary to encode the pages.\nThe book was issued in 1886 and 1887 in Lyon, France, and was publicly displayed at the 1889 \"Exposition Universelle\" (World's Fair). It was designed by R.\u00a0P.\u00a0J. Hervier, woven by J.\u00a0A. Henry, and published by A.\u00a0Roux. It took two years and almost 50 trials to get correct. An estimated 50 or 60 copies were produced.\nThe manufacture of the volume employed the Jacquard method of using punch cards which J.A. Henry first used in (by Alphonse de Lamartine) in 1878. That earlier title is the true \"first book 'printed' by computer\".\nImportance in computing.\nThe Jacquard head used replaceable punched cards to control a sequence of operations. It is considered an important step in the history of computing hardware. The ability to change the pattern of the loom's weave by simply changing cards was an important conceptual precursor to the development of computer programming and data entry. Charles Babbage knew of Jacquard machines and planned to use cards to store programs in his Analytical Engine. In the late 19th century, Herman Hollerith took the idea of using punched cards to store information a step further when he created a punched card tabulating machine which he used to input data for the 1890 U.S. Census. A large data processing industry using punched-card technology was developed in the first half of the twentieth century\u2014dominated initially by the International Business Machine corporation (IBM) with its line of unit record equipment. The cards were used for data, however, with programming done by plugboards.\nSome early computers, such as the 1944 IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator (Harvard Mark I) received program instructions from a paper tape punched with holes, similar to Jacquard's string of cards. Later computers executed programs from higher-speed memory, though cards were commonly used to load the programs into memory. Punched cards remained in use in computing up until the mid-1980s.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

JUnit is often used for unit testing, and is one of the xUnit frameworks.\nJUnit is linked as a JAR at compile-time. The latest version of the framework, JUnit 5, resides under package . Previous versions JUnit 4 and JUnit 3 were under packages and , respectively.\nA research survey performed in 2013 across 10,000 Java projects hosted on GitHub found that JUnit (in a tie with slf4j-api) was the most commonly included external library. Each library was used by 30.7% of projects.\nJUnit Lifecycle.\nEvery JUnit test class usually has several test cases. These test cases are subject to the test life cycle. The full JUnit Lifecycle has three major phases:\nIntegration with other tools.\nJUnit 5 integrates a number of tools, such as build tools, integrated development environments (IDE), continuous integration (CI) tools and many more.\nBuild Tools.\nJUnit supports Apache Ant, Apache Maven and Gradle build tools, which are the most widely used project build tools. Build tools are vital for automating the process of building the project. \nAnt Extension.\nApache Ant, also known as Ant, is one of the build tools with the highest degree of versatility, and has the longest history out of the three build tools listed above. Ant centers around the codice_1 file, used for configuring the tasks necessary to run a project. Ant also has an extension called Apache Ivy, which helps deal with dependency resolution. The project dependencies can be declared in the codice_2 file. Ant can integrate with JUnit 5 by configuring the Java code coverage tools (JaCoCo), for the codice_2 file. The codice_2 can then be configured with the codice_5 and codice_6 dependencies to integrate with JUnit 5. \nMaven Extension.\nIn contrast to Ant, Apache Maven, also known as Maven, uses a standardized and unified approach to the build process. Maven follows the paradigm of \"convention over configuration\" for managing its dependencies. The Java source code (or \"src\") can be found under the codice_7 directory, and the test files can be found under the codice_8 directory. Maven can be used for any Java Project. It uses the Project Object Model (POM), which is an XML-based approach to configuring the build steps for the project. The minimal Maven with the codice_9 build file must contain a list of dependencies and a unique project identifier. Maven must be available on the build path to work. Maven can integrate with JUnit 5 using the codice_10 plugin which supports out-of-box functionality for JUnit 5 tests. Different Maven goals can be specified to achieve these tasks.\nGradle Extension.\nGradle is a build tool that borrows many concepts from its predecessors, Ant and Maven. It uses the file to declare the steps required for the project build. Unlike Ant and Maven, which are XML-based, Gradle requires the use of Apache Groovy, which is a Java-based programming language. Unlike Ant and Maven, Gradle does not require the use of XML. Gradle still adheres to Maven's \"convention over configuration\" approach, and follows the same structure for and directories. Gradle can integrate with JUnit 5 by configuring a plugin alongside the junit-platform plug-in given by the JUnit 5 team in the build file.\nJUnit Extension Model.\nJUnit follows the paradigm of preferring extension points over features. The JUnit team decided not to put all features within the JUnit core, and instead decided to give an extensible way for developers to address their concerns. \nIn JUnit 4, there are two extension mechanisms: the Runner API and Rule API. There were some disadvantages to both the Runner API and the Rule API. \nA major limitation of the Runner API is that developers must implement the entire test lifecycle, even if only a specific phase is required. This is too complicated and heavyweight for most use cases. Another major limitation is that only one runner class can be used per test case, which makes runners non-composable. For example, Mockito and Parameterized runners cannot be used together within the same test class. \nA major limitation of the Rule API is that it cannot control the entire test lifecycle and is therefore unsuitable for certain use cases. Rules are only suitable for operations that need to run before or after test execution. Another limitation is that class-level and method-level rules must be defined separately. \nIn JUnit 5, the extension API is found within the JUnit Jupiter Engine. The JUnit Team wants to allow the developer to hook to separate stages of a test life cycle by providing a single unified extension API. Upon reaching a certain life cycle phase, the Jupiter Engine will invoke all registered extensions for that phase. The developer can hook into five major extension points:\nExample of a JUnit test fixture.\nA JUnit test fixture is a Java object. Test methods must be annotated by the annotation. If the situation requires it, it is also possible to define a method to execute before (or after) each (or all) of the test methods with the (or ) and (or ) annotations.\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.*;\nclass FoobarTests {\n @BeforeAll\n static void setUpClass() throws Exception {\n // Code executed before the first test method\n @BeforeEach\n void setUp() throws Exception {\n // Code executed before each test\n \n @Test\n void oneThing() {\n // Code that tests one thing\n @Test\n void anotherThing() {\n // Code that tests another thing\n @Test\n void somethingElse() {\n // Code that tests something else\n @AfterEach\n void tearDown() throws Exception {\n // Code executed after each test \n \n @AfterAll\n static void tearDownClass() throws Exception {\n // Code executed after the last test method \nPrevious versions of JUnit.\nAccording to Martin Fowler, one of the early adopters of JUnit:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;JUnit was born on a flight from Zurich to the 1997 OOPSLA in Atlanta. Kent was flying with Erich Gamma, and what else were two geeks to do on a long flight but program? The first version of JUnit was built there, pair programmed, and done test first (a pleasing form of meta-circular geekery).\nAs a side effect of its wide use, previous versions of JUnit remain popular, with JUnit 4 having over 100,000 usages by other software components on the Maven Central repository.\nIn JUnit 4, the annotations for test execution callbacks were , , , and , as opposed to JUnit 5's , , , and .\nIn JUnit 3, test fixtures had to inherit from .

One of the most important American theatre composers of the early 20th century, he wrote more than 700 songs, used in over 100 stage works, including such classics as \"Ol' Man River\", \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\", \"A Fine Romance\", \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\", \"The Song Is You\", \"All the Things You Are\", \"The Way You Look Tonight\" and \"Long Ago (and Far Away)\". He collaborated with many of the leading librettists and lyricists of his era, including George Grossmith Jr., Guy Bolton, P. G. Wodehouse, Otto Harbach, Oscar Hammerstein II, Dorothy Fields, Johnny Mercer, Ira Gershwin and Yip Harburg.\nA native New Yorker, Kern created dozens of Broadway musicals and Hollywood films in a career that lasted for more than four decades. His musical innovations, such as 4/4 dance rhythms and the employment of syncopation and jazz progressions, built on, rather than rejected, earlier musical theatre tradition. He and his collaborators also employed his melodies to further the action or develop characterization to a greater extent than in the other musicals of his day, creating the model for later musicals. Although dozens of Kern's musicals and musical films were hits, only \"Show Boat\" is now regularly revived. Songs from his other shows, however, are still frequently performed and adapted. Many of Kern's songs have been adapted by jazz musicians to become standard tunes.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nKern was born in New York City, on Sutton Place, in what was then the city's brewery district. His parents were Henry Kern (1842\u20131908), a Jewish German immigrant, and Fannie Kern \"n\u00e9e\" Kakeles (1852\u20131907), who was a Jewish American woman of Bohemian parentage. At the time of Kern's birth, his father ran a livery stable; later, he became a successful merchant. Kern grew up on East 56th Street in Manhattan, where he attended public schools. He showed an early aptitude for music and was taught to play the piano and organ by his mother, a professional player and teacher.\nIn 1897, the family moved to Newark, New Jersey, where Kern attended Newark High School (which became Barringer High School in 1907). He wrote songs for the school's first musical, a minstrel show, in 1901, and for an amateur musical adaptation of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" put on at the Newark Yacht Club in January 1902. Kern left high school before graduation in the spring of his senior year in 1902. In response, Kern's father insisted that his son work with him in business, instead of composing. Kern, however, failed miserably in one of his earliest tasks: he was supposed to purchase two pianos for the store, but instead he ordered 200. His father relented, and later in 1902, Kern became a student at the New York College of Music, studying the piano under Alexander Lambert and Paolo Gallico, and harmony under Dr. Austin Pierce. His first published composition, a piano piece, \"At the Casino\", appeared in the same year. Between 1903 and 1905, he continued his musical training under private tutors in Heidelberg, Germany, returning to New York via London.\nFirst compositions.\nFor a time, Kern worked as a rehearsal pianist in Broadway theatres and as a song-plugger for Tin Pan Alley music publishers. While in London, he secured a contract from the American impresario Charles Frohman to provide songs for interpolation in Broadway versions of London shows. He began to provide these additions in 1904 to British scores for \"An English Daisy\", by Seymour Hicks and Walter Slaughter, and \"Mr. Wix of Wickham\", for which he wrote most of the songs.\nIn 1905, Kern contributed the song \"How'd you like to spoon with me?\" to Ivan Caryll's hit musical \"The Earl and the Girl\" when the show transferred to Chicago and New York in 1905. He also contributed to the New York production of \"The Catch of the Season\" (1905), \"The Little Cherub\" (1906) and \"The Orchid\" (1907), among other shows. From 1905 on, he spent long periods of time in London, contributing songs to West End shows like \"The Beauty of Bath\" (1906; with lyricist P. G. Wodehouse) and making valuable contacts, including George Grossmith Jr. and Seymour Hicks, who were the first to introduce Kern's songs to the London stage. In 1909 during one of his stays in England, Kern took a boat trip on the River Thames with some friends, and when the boat stopped at Walton-on-Thames, they went to an inn called the Swan for a drink. Kern was much taken with the proprietor's daughter, Eva Leale (1891\u20131959), who was working behind the bar. He wooed her, and they were married at the Anglican church of St. Mary's in Walton on October 25, 1910. The couple then lived at the Swan when Kern was in England.\nKern is believed to have composed music for silent films as early as 1912, but the earliest documented film music which he is known to have written was for a twenty-part serial, \"Gloria's Romance\" in 1916. This was one of the first starring vehicles for Billie Burke, for whom Kern had earlier written the song \"Mind the Paint\", with lyrics by A. W. Pinero. The film is now considered lost, but Kern's music survives. Another score for the silent movies, \"Jubilo\", followed in 1919. Kern was one of the founding members of ASCAP.\nKern's first complete score was Broadway's \"The Red Petticoat\" (1912), one of the first musical-comedy Westerns. The libretto was by Rida Johnson Young. By World War I, more than a hundred of Kern's songs had been used in about thirty productions, mostly Broadway adaptations of West End and European shows. Kern contributed two songs to \"To-Night's the Night\" (1914), another Rubens musical. It opened in New York and went on to become a hit in London. The best known of Kern's songs from this period is probably \"They Didn't Believe Me\", which was a hit in the New York version of the Paul Rubens and Sidney Jones musical, \"The Girl from Utah\" (1914), for which Kern wrote five songs. Kern's song, with four beats to a bar, departed from the customary waltz-rhythms of European influence and fitted the new American passion for modern dances such as the fox-trot. He was also able to use elements of American styles, such as ragtime, as well as syncopation, in his lively dance tunes. Theatre historian John Kenrick writes that the song put Kern in great demand on Broadway and established a pattern for musical comedy love songs that lasted through the 1960s.\nIn May 1915, Kern was due to sail with Charles Frohman from New York to London on board the RMS \"Lusitania\", but Kern missed the boat, having overslept after staying up late playing poker. Frohman died in the sinking of the ship.\nPrincess Theatre musicals.\nKern composed 16 Broadway scores between 1915 and 1920 and also contributed songs to the London hit \"Theodore &amp; Co\" (1916; most of the songs are by the young Ivor Novello) and to revues like the Ziegfeld Follies. The most notable of his scores were those for a series of shows written for the Princess Theatre, a small (299-seat) house built by Ray Comstock. Theatrical agent Elisabeth Marbury asked Kern and librettist Guy Bolton to create a series of intimate and low-budget, yet smart, musicals.\nThe \"Princess Theatre shows\" were unique on Broadway not only for their small size, but their clever, coherent plots, integrated scores and naturalistic acting, which presented \"a sharp contrast to the large-scale Ruritanian operettas then in vogue\" or the star-studded revues and extravaganzas of producers like Florenz Ziegfeld. Earlier musical comedy had often been thinly plotted, gaudy pieces, marked by the insertion of songs into their scores with little regard to the plot. But Kern and Bolton followed the examples of Gilbert and Sullivan and French \"op\u00e9ra bouffe\" in integrating song and story. \"These shows built and polished the mold from which almost all later major musical comedies evolved. ... The characters and situations were, within the limitations of musical comedy license, believable and the humor came from the situations or the nature of the characters. Kern's exquisitely flowing melodies were employed to further the action or develop characterization.\" The shows featured modern American settings and simple scene changes to suit the small theatre.\nThe team's first Princess Theatre show was an adaptation of Paul Rubens' 1905 London show, \"Mr. Popple (of Ippleton)\", called \"Nobody Home\" (1915). The piece ran for 135 performances and was a modest financial success. However, it did little to fulfill the new team's mission to innovate, except that Kern's song, \"The Magic Melody\", was the first Broadway showtune with a basic jazz progression. Kern and Bolton next created an original piece, \"Very Good Eddie\", which was a surprise hit, running for 341 performances, with additional touring productions that went on into the 1918-19 season. The British humorist, lyricist and librettist P. G. Wodehouse joined the Princess team in 1917, adding his skill as a lyricist to the succeeding shows. \"Oh, Boy!\" (1917) ran for an extraordinary 463 performances. Other shows written for the theatre were \"Have a Heart\" (1917), \"Leave It to Jane\" (1917) and \"Oh, Lady! Lady!!\" (1918). The first opened at another theatre before \"Very Good Eddie\" closed. The second played elsewhere during the long run of \"Oh Boy!\" An anonymous admirer wrote a verse in their praise that begins:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn February 1918, Dorothy Parker wrote in \"Vanity Fair\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Well, Bolton and Wodehouse and Kern have done it again. Every time these three gather together, the Princess Theatre is sold out for months in advance. You can get a seat for \"Oh, Lady! Lady!!\" somewhere around the middle of August for just about the price of one on the stock exchange. If you ask me, I will look you fearlessly in the eye and tell you in low, throbbing tones that it has it over any other musical comedy in town. But then Bolton and Wodehouse and Kern are my favorite indoor sport. I like the way they go about a musical comedy. ... I like the way the action slides casually into the songs. ... I like the deft rhyming of the song that is always sung in the last act by two comedians and a comedienne. And oh, how I do like Jerome Kern's music. And all these things are even more so in \"Oh, Lady! Lady!!\" than they were in \"Oh, Boy!\" \n\"Oh, Lady! Lady!!\" was the last successful \"Princess Theatre show\". Kern and Wodehouse disagreed over money, and the composer decided to move on to other projects. Kern's importance to the partnership was illustrated by the fate of the last musical of the series, \"Oh, My Dear!\" (1918), to which he contributed only one song: \"Go, Little Boat\". The rest of the show was composed by Louis Hirsch and ran for 189 performances: \"Despite a respectable run, everyone realized there was little point in continuing the series without Kern.\"\nEarly 1920s.\nThe 1920s were an extremely productive period in American musical theatre, and Kern created at least one show every year for the entire decade. His first show of 1920 was \"The Night Boat\", with book and lyrics by Anne Caldwell, which ran for more than 300 performances in New York and for three seasons on tour. Later in the same year, Kern wrote the score for \"Sally\", with a book by Bolton and lyrics by Otto Harbach. This show, staged by Florenz Ziegfeld, ran for 570 performances, one of the longest runs of any Broadway show in the decade, and popularized the song \"Look for the Silver Lining\" (which had been written for an earlier show), performed by the rising star Marilyn Miller. It also had a long run in London in 1921, produced by George Grossmith Jr. Kern's next shows were \"Good Morning, Dearie\" (1921, with Caldwell) which ran for 347 performances; followed in 1922 by a West End success, \"The Cabaret Girl\" in collaboration with Grossmith and Wodehouse; another modest success by the same team, \"The Beauty Prize\" (1923); and a Broadway flop, \"The Bunch and Judy\", remembered, if at all, as the first time Kern and Fred Astaire worked together.\n\"Stepping Stones\" (1923, with Caldwell) was a success, and in 1924 the Princess Theatre team of Bolton, Wodehouse and Kern reunited to write \"Sitting Pretty\", but it did not recapture the popularity of the earlier collaborations. Its relative failure may have been partly due to Kern's growing aversion to having individual songs from his shows performed out of context on radio, in cabaret, or on record, although his chief objection was to jazz interpretations of his songs. He called himself a \"musical clothier \u2013 nothing more or less,\" and said, \"I write music to both the situations and the lyrics in plays.\" When \"Sitting Pretty\" was produced, he forbade any broadcasting or recording of individual numbers from the show, which limited their chance to gain popularity.\n1925 was a major turning point in Kern's career when he met Oscar Hammerstein II, with whom he would entertain a lifelong friendship and collaboration. As a young man, Kern had been an easy companion with great charm and humor, but he became less outgoing in his middle years, sometimes difficult to work with: he once introduced himself to a producer by saying, \"I hear you're a son of a bitch. So am I.\" He rarely collaborated with any one lyricist for long. With Hammerstein, however, he remained on close terms for the rest of his life. Their first show, written together with Harbach, was \"Sunny\", which featured the song \"Who (Stole My Heart Away)?\" Marilyn Miller played the title role, as she had in \"Sally\". The show ran for 517 performances on Broadway, and the following year ran for 363 performances in the West End, starring Binnie Hale and Jack Buchanan.\n\"Show Boat\".\nBecause of the strong success of \"Sally\" and \"Sunny\" and consistent good results with his other shows, Ziegfeld was willing to gamble on Kern's next project in 1927. Kern had been impressed by Edna Ferber's novel \"Show Boat\" and wished to present a musical stage version. He persuaded Hammerstein to adapt it and Ziegfeld to produce it. The story, dealing with racism, marital strife and alcoholism, was unheard of in the escapist world of musical comedy. Despite his doubts, Ziegfeld spared no expense in staging the piece to give it its full epic grandeur. According to the theatre historian John Kenrick: \"After the opening night audience filed out of the Ziegfeld Theatre in near silence, Ziegfeld thought his worst fears had been confirmed. He was pleasantly surprised when the next morning brought ecstatic reviews and long lines at the box office. In fact, \"Show Boat\" proved to be the most lasting accomplishment of Ziegfeld's career \u2013 the only one of his shows that is regularly performed today.\" The score is, arguably, Kern's greatest and includes the well-known songs \"Ol' Man River\" and \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\" as well as \"Make Believe\", \"You Are Love\", \"Life Upon the Wicked Stage\", \"Why Do I Love You\", all with lyrics by Hammerstein, and \"Bill\", originally written for \"Oh, Lady! Lady!\", with lyrics by P. G. Wodehouse. The show ran for 572 performances on Broadway and was also a success in London. Although Ferber's novel was filmed unsuccessfully as a part-talkie in 1929 (using some songs from the Kern score), the musical itself was filmed twice, in 1936, and, with Technicolor, in 1951. In 1989, a stage version of the musical was presented on television for the first time, in a production from the Paper Mill Playhouse telecast by PBS on \"Great Performances\".\nWhile most Kern musicals have largely been forgotten, except for their songs, \"Show Boat\" remains well-remembered and frequently seen. It is a staple of stock productions and has been revived numerous times on Broadway and in London. A 1946 revival integrated choreography into the show, in the manner of a Rodgers and Hammerstein production, as did the 1994 Harold Prince\u2013Susan Stroman revival, which was nominated for ten Tony Awards, winning five, including best revival. It was the first musical to enter a major opera company's repertory (New York City Opera, 1954), and the rediscovery of the 1927 score with Robert Russell Bennett's original orchestrations led to a large-scale EMI recording in 1987 and several opera-house productions. In 1941, the conductor Artur Rodzi\u0144ski wished to commission a symphonic suite from the score, but Kern considered himself a songwriter and not a symphonist. He never orchestrated his own scores, leaving that to musical assistants, principally Frank Saddler (until 1921) and Robert Russell Bennett (from 1923). In response to the commission, Kern oversaw an arrangement by Charles Miller and Emil Gerstenberger of numbers from the show into the orchestral work \"Scenario for Orchestra: Themes from Show Boat\", premiered in 1941 by the Cleveland Orchestra conducted by Rodzi\u0144ski.\nKern's last Broadway show in the 1920s was \"Sweet Adeline\" (1929), with a libretto by Hammerstein. It was a period piece, set in the Gay 90s, about a girl from Hoboken, New Jersey (near Kern's childhood home), who becomes a Broadway star. Opening just before the stock market crash, it received rave reviews, but the elaborate, old-fashioned piece was a step back from the innovations in \"Show Boat\", or even the Princess Theatre shows. In January 1929, at the height of the Jazz Age, and with \"Show Boat\" still playing on Broadway, Kern made news on both sides of the Atlantic for reasons wholly unconnected with music. He sold at auction, at New York's Anderson Galleries, the collection of English and American literature that he had been building up for more than a decade. The collection, rich in inscribed first editions and manuscript material of eighteenth and nineteenth century authors, sold for a total of $1,729,462.50 () \u2013 a record for a single-owner sale that stood for over fifty years. Among the books he sold were first or early editions of poems by Robert Burns and Percy Bysshe Shelley, and works by Jonathan Swift, Henry Fielding and Charles Dickens, as well as manuscripts by Alexander Pope, John Keats, Shelley, Lord Byron, Thomas Hardy and others.\nFirst films and later shows.\nIn 1929, Kern made his first trip to Hollywood to supervise the 1929 film version of \"Sally\", one of the first \"all-talking\" Technicolor films. The following year, he was there a second time to work on \"Men of the Sky\", released in 1931 without his songs, and a 1930 film version of \"Sunny\". There was a public reaction against the early glut of film musicals after the advent of film sound; Hollywood released more than 100 musical films in 1930, but only 14 in 1931. Warner Bros. bought out Kern's contract, and he returned to the stage. He collaborated with Harbach on the Broadway musical \"The Cat and the Fiddle\" (1931), about a composer and an opera singer, featuring the songs \"She Didn't Say Yes\" and \"The Night Was Made for Love\". It ran for 395 performances, a remarkable success for the Depression years, and transferred to London the following year. It was filmed in 1934 with Jeanette MacDonald.\n\"Music in the Air\" (1932) was another Kern-Hammerstein collaboration and another show-biz plot, best remembered today for \"The Song Is You\" and \"I've Told Ev'ry Little Star\". It was \"undoubtedly an operetta\", set in the German countryside, but without the Ruritanian trimmings of the operettas of Kern's youth. \"Roberta\" (1933) by Kern and Harbach included the songs \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\", \"Let's Begin\" and \"Yesterdays\" and featured, among others, Bob Hope, Fred MacMurray, George Murphy and Sydney Greenstreet all in the early stages of their careers. Kern's \"Three Sisters\" (1934) was his last West End show, with a libretto by Hammerstein. The musical, depicting horse-racing, the circus, and class distinctions, was a failure, running for only two months. Its song \"I Won't Dance\" was used in the film \"Roberta\". Some British critics objected to American writers essaying a British story; James Agate, doyen of London theatre critics of the day, dismissed it as \"American inanity,\" though both Kern and Hammerstein were strong and knowledgeable Anglophiles. Kern's last Broadway show (other than revivals) was \"Very Warm for May\" (1939), another show-biz story and another disappointment, although the score included the Kern and Hammerstein classic \"All The Things You Are\".\nKern in Hollywood.\nIn 1935, when musical films had become popular once again, thanks to Busby Berkeley, Kern returned to Hollywood, where he composed the scores to a dozen more films, although he also continued working on Broadway productions. He settled permanently in Hollywood in 1937. After suffering a heart attack in 1939, he was told by his doctors to concentrate on film scores, a less stressful task, as Hollywood songwriters were not as deeply involved with the production of their works as Broadway songwriters. This second phase of Kern's Hollywood career had considerably greater artistic and commercial success than the first. With Hammerstein, he wrote songs for the film versions of his recent Broadway shows \"Music in the Air\" (1934), which starred Gloria Swanson in a rare singing role, and \"Sweet Adeline\" (1935). With Dorothy Fields, he composed the new music for \"I Dream Too Much\" (1935), a musical melodrama about the opera world, starring the Metropolitan Opera diva Lily Pons. Kern and Fields interspersed the opera numbers with their songs, including \"the swinging 'I Got Love,' the lullaby 'The Jockey on the Carousel,' and the entrancing title song.\" Also with Fields, he wrote two new songs, \"I Won't Dance\" and \"Lovely to Look At\", for the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film version of \"Roberta\" (1935), which was a hit. The show also included the song \"I'll Be Hard to Handle\". This was given a 1952 remake called \"Lovely to Look At\".\nTheir next film, \"Swing Time\" (1936) included the song \"The Way You Look Tonight\", which won the Academy Award in 1936 for the best song. Other songs in \"Swing Time\" include \"A Fine Romance\", \"Pick Yourself Up\" and \"Never Gonna Dance\". \"The Oxford Companion to the American Musical\" calls \"Swing Time\" \"a strong candidate for the best of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals\" and says that, although the screenplay is contrived, it \"left plenty of room for dance and all of it was superb. ... Although the movie is remembered as one of the great dance musicals, it also boasts one of the best film scores of the 1930s.\" For the 1936 film version of \"Show Boat\", Kern and Hammerstein wrote three new songs, including \"I Have The Room Above Her\" and \"Ah Still Suits Me\". \"High, Wide, and Handsome\" (1937) was intentionally similar in plot and style to \"Show Boat\", but it was a box-office failure. Kern songs were also used in the Cary Grant film, \"When You're in Love\" (1937), and the first Abbott and Costello feature, \"One Night in the Tropics\" (1940). In 1940, Hammerstein wrote the lyric \"The Last Time I Saw Paris\", in homage to the French capital, recently occupied by the Germans. Kern set it, the only time he set a pre-written lyric, and his only hit song not written as part of a musical. Originally a hit for Tony Martin and later for No\u00ebl Coward, the song was used in the film \"Lady Be Good\" (1941) and won Kern another Oscar for best song. Kern's second and last symphonic work was his \"Mark Twain Suite\" (1942).\nIn his last Hollywood musicals, Kern worked with several new and distinguished partners. With Johnny Mercer for \"You Were Never Lovelier\" (1942), he contributed \"a set of memorable songs to entertain audiences until the plot came to its inevitable conclusion\". The film starred Astaire and Rita Hayworth and included the song \"I'm Old Fashioned\". Kern's next collaboration was with Ira Gershwin on \"Cover Girl\" starring Hayworth and Gene Kelly (1944) for which Kern composed \"Sure Thing\",\"Put Me to the Test,\" \"Make Way for Tomorrow\" (lyric by E. Y. Harburg), and the hit ballad \"Long Ago (and Far Away)\". For the Deanna Durbin Western musical, \"Can't Help Singing\" (1944), with lyrics by Harburg, Kern \"provided the best original score of Durbin's career, mixing operetta and Broadway sounds in such songs as 'Any Moment Now,' 'Swing Your Partner,' 'More and More,' and the lilting title number.\" \"More and More\" was nominated for an Oscar.\nKern composed his last film score, \"Centennial Summer\" (1946) in which \"the songs were as resplendent as the story and characters were mediocre. ... Oscar Hammerstein, Leo Robin, and E. Y. Harburg contributed lyrics for Kern's lovely music, resulting in the soulful ballad 'All Through the Day,' the rustic 'Cinderella Sue,' the cheerful 'Up With the Lark,' and the torchy 'In Love in Vain.'\" \"All Through the Day\" was another Oscar nominee. The music of Kern's last two films is notable in the way it developed from his earlier work. Some of it was too advanced for the film companies; Kern's biographer, Stephen Banfield, refers to \"tonal experimentation ... outlandish enharmonics\" that the studios insisted on cutting. At the same time, in some ways his music came full circle: having in his youth helped to end the reigns of the waltz and operetta, he now composed three of his finest waltzes (\"Can't Help Singing\", \"Californ-i-ay\" and \"Up With the Lark\"), the last having a distinctly operetta-like character.\nPersonal life and death.\nKern and his wife, Eva, often vacationed on their yacht \"Show Boat\". He collected rare books and enjoyed betting on horses. At the time of Kern's death, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was filming a fictionalized version of his life, \"Till the Clouds Roll By\", which was released in 1946 starring Robert Walker as Kern. In the film, Kern's songs are sung by Judy Garland, Kathryn Grayson, June Allyson, Lena Horne, Dinah Shore, Frank Sinatra and Angela Lansbury, among others, and Gower Champion and Cyd Charisse appear as dancers. Many of the biographical elements are fictionalized.\nIn the fall of 1945, Kern returned to New York City to oversee auditions for a new revival of \"Show Boat\", and began to work on the score for what would become the musical \"Annie Get Your Gun\", to be produced by Rodgers and Hammerstein. On November 5, 1945, at 60 years of age, he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while walking at the corner of Park Avenue and 57th Street. Identifiable only by his ASCAP card, Kern was initially taken to the indigent ward at City Hospital, later being transferred to Doctors Hospital in Manhattan. Hammerstein was at his side when Kern's breathing stopped. Hammerstein hummed or sang the song \"I've Told Ev'ry Little Star\" from \"Music in the Air\" (a personal favorite of the composer's) into Kern's ear. Receiving no response, Hammerstein realized Kern had died. Rodgers and Hammerstein then assigned the task of writing the score for \"Annie Get Your Gun\" to the veteran Broadway composer Irving Berlin.\nKern is interred at Ferncliff Cemetery in Westchester County, New York. His daughter, Elizabeth \"Betty\" Jane Kern (1918\u20131996) married Artie Shaw in 1942 and later Jack Cummings. Kern's wife eventually remarried, to a singer named George Byron.\nAccolades.\nJerome Kern was nominated eight times for an Academy Award and won twice. Seven nominations were for Best Original Song; these included a posthumous nomination in each of 1945 and 1946. One nomination was in 1945 for Best Original Music Score. Kern was not eligible for any Tony Awards, which were not created until 1947. In 1976, \"Very Good Eddie\" was nominated for a Drama Desk Award as Outstanding Revival, and the director and actors received various Tony, Drama Desk and other awards and nominations. Elisabeth Welsh was nominated for a Tony Award for her performance in \"Jerome Kern Goes to Hollywood\" in 1986, and \"Show Boat\" received Tony nominations in both 1983 and 1995, winning for best revival in 1995 (among numerous other awards and nominations), and won the Laurence Olivier Award for best revival in 2008. In 1986, \"Big Deal\" was nominated for the Tony for best musical, among other awards, and Bob Fosse won as best choreographer. In 2000, \"Swing!\", featuring Kern's \"I Won't Dance\" was nominated for the Tony for Best Musical, among others. In 2002, \"Elaine Stritch at Liberty\", featuring Kern's \"All in Fun\", won the Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event. In 2004, \"Never Gonna Dance\" received two Tony nominations.\nKern was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame posthumously in 1970. In 1985, the U.S. Post Office issued a postage stamp (Scott #2110, 22\u00a2), with an illustration of Kern holding sheet music. The Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia was named after Kern by his Dixieland bandleader father.\nSelected works.\nNote: All shows listed are musical comedies for which Kern was the sole composer unless otherwise specified.\nDuring his first phase of work (1904\u20131911), Kern wrote songs for 22 Broadway productions, including songs interpolated into British musicals or featured in revues (sometimes writing lyrics as well as music), and he occasionally co-wrote musicals with one or two other composers. During visits to London beginning in 1905, he also composed songs that were first performed in several London shows. The following are some of the most notable such shows from this period:\nFrom 1912 to 1924, the more-experienced Kern began to work on dramatically concerned shows, including incidental music for plays, and, for the first time since his college show \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", he wrote musicals as the sole composer. His regular lyricist collaborators for his more than 30 shows during this period were Bolton, Wodehouse, Caldwell, Harry B. Smith and Howard Dietz. Some of his most notable shows during this very productive period were as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDuring the last phase of his theatrical composing career, Kern continued to work with his previous collaborators but also met Oscar Hammerstein II and Otto Harbach, with whom Kern wrote his most lasting, memorable, and well-known works. The most successful of these are as follows:\nIn addition to revivals of his most popular shows, Kern's music has been posthumously featured in a variety of revues, musicals and concerts on and off Broadway.\nKern's songs.\nAmong the more than 700 songs by Kern are such classics as \"They Didn't Believe Me\" (1914), \"Look for the Silver Lining\" (1920), \"Ol' Man River\", \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\", \"Make Believe\", \"You Are Love\" and \"Bill\" (all from \"Show Boat\", 1927), \"The Song Is You\" (1932), \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\", \"Yesterdays\" and \"Let's Begin\" (all from \"Roberta\", 1933), \"I Won't Dance\" (1935), \"A Fine Romance\" and the Academy Award-winning \"The Way You Look Tonight\" (both from \"Swing Time\", 1936), \"All the Things You Are\" (1939) and \"I'm Old Fashioned\" (1942). Another Oscar winner was \"The Last Time I Saw Paris\". One of Kern's last hits was \"Long Ago (and Far Away)\" (1944).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Henson was also well known for creating \"Fraggle Rock\" (1983\u20131987) and as the director of \"The Dark Crystal\" (1982) and \"Labyrinth\" (1986).\nBorn in Greenville, Mississippi, and raised in both Leland, Mississippi, and University Park, Maryland, Henson began developing puppets in high school. He created \"Sam and Friends\" (1955\u20131961), a short-form comedy television program on WRC-TV, while he was a freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park, in collaboration with fellow student Jane Nebel. Henson and Nebel co-founded Muppets, Inc. \u2013 now The Jim Henson Company \u2013 in 1958, and married less than a year later in 1959. Henson graduated from the University of Maryland with a degree in home economics.\nIn 1969, Henson joined the children's television program \"Sesame Street\" (1969\u2013present) where he helped to develop Muppet characters for the series. He and his creative team also appeared on the first season of the sketch comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\" (1975\u2013present). He produced the sketch comedy television series \"The Muppet Show\" (1976\u20131981) during this period. Henson revolutionized the way puppetry is captured and presented in video media, and he won fame for his characters \u2013 particularly Kermit the Frog, Rowlf the Dog, and the characters on \"Sesame Street\". During the later years of his life, he founded the Jim Henson Foundation and Jim Henson's Creature Shop. He won the Emmy Award twice for his involvement in \"The Storyteller\" (1987\u20131988) and \"The Jim Henson Hour\" (1989).\nHenson died in New York City from toxic shock syndrome caused by \"Streptococcus pyogenes\". At the time of his death, he was in negotiations to sell his company to The Walt Disney Company, but talks fell through after his death. He was posthumously awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1991, and was named a Disney Legend in 2011.\nEarly life.\nJames Maury Henson was born on September 24, 1936, in Greenville, Mississippi, the younger of two children of Betty Marcella (n\u00e9e Brown, 1904\u20131972) and Paul Ransom Henson (1904\u20131994), an agronomist for the United States Department of Agriculture. Henson's older brother, Paul Ransom Henson Jr. (1932\u20131956), died in a car crash on April 15, 1956. He was raised as a Christian Scientist and spent his early childhood in nearby Leland, Mississippi, before moving with his family to University Park, Maryland, near Washington, D.C., in the late 1940s and later to Bethesda, Maryland. He remembered the arrival of the family's first television as \"the biggest event of his adolescence\", being heavily influenced by radio ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and the early television puppets of Burr Tillstrom on \"Kukla, Fran and Ollie\" and Bil and Cora Baird. He remained a Christian Scientist at least into his twenties, when he taught Sunday school, but he wrote to a Christian Science church in the early 1970s to inform them that he was no longer a practicing member.\nCareer.\nEducation.\nHenson attended a variety of grade schools in his youth, including Hyattsville High School until it was closed in 1951. He completed his high school career at the newly opened Northwestern High School, where he joined the puppetry club.\nHe enrolled at the University of Maryland, College Park, the following fall as a studio arts major, thinking that he might become a commercial artist. As a freshman at the university, Jim took a newly offered puppetry class mostly populated with seniors, including his future wife Jane Nebel. He was graduated in 1960 with a Bachelor of Science degree in home economics.\nEarly career: 1954\u20131961.\nHenson began working at WTOP-TV (now WUSA-TV) in the late spring of 1954, at age , hired to \"manipulate marionettes\" on a Saturday morning children's show called \"The Junior Morning Show\", until the show was cancelled only three weeks later. This first break into the television industry was short-lived, but his talent landed him and his puppets an opportunity to continue working at WTOP-TV, lip syncing on Roy Meachum's \"Saturday\" show.\nHenson's employment at WTOP-TV lasted only until August, when \"Saturday\" was also cancelled. Meachum then referred Jim to the local NBC-affiliate station WRC-TV, where Henson continued performing his puppets with Jane's help. The two were eventually offered a nightly segment for which they created \"Sam and Friends\", a three-to-five-minute puppet show that afforded Henson much more freedom to develop his own creative work. The characters on \"Sam and Friends\" were forerunners of the Muppets, and the show included a prototype of Henson's most famous character, Kermit the Frog. He remained at WRC until \"Sam and Friends\" aired its last episode on December 15, 1961.\nIn the show, Henson began experimenting with techniques that changed the way in which puppetry was used on television, foregoing the convention of pointing the camera at a stationary puppet theatre proscenium and instead using the image created by the TV camera and lens to dynamically engage with his characters. He believed that television puppets needed to have \"life and sensitivity\". Rather than carving wooden puppets Henson built characters from softer, flexible materials like foam rubber; his first iteration of Kermit was made from a halved table tennis ball and fabric from an old coat belonging to his mother, with denim from a pair of jeans forming the sleeve for the puppeteer's arm.\nThough Henson told people that \"Muppet\" was a portmanteau of \"marionette\" and \"Puppet\", many early Muppets were actually hand puppets, rod puppets, or some combination of the two. Direct control over the puppet's mouth, in combination with the softer construction materials, allowed the puppeteer to express a wider range of emotions and to more accurately move the puppet's mouth along with the character's dialogue or while lip syncing to music. Commenting on his puppet design philosophy, Henson said,\"A lot of people build very stiff puppets\u2014you can barely move the things\u2014and you can get very little expression out of a character that you can barely move. Your hand has a lot of flexibility to it, and what you want to do is to build a puppet that can reflect all that flexibility.\"\"Sam and Friends\" was a financial success, but Henson began to have doubts about going into a career performing with puppets once he graduated. He spent six weeks in Europe during the summer of 1958, originally with the intent to study painting, but was surprised to learn that puppets were considered just as serious of an art form as painting or sculpture. After returning to the United States he and Jane made their partnership official, creating Muppets, Inc. in November of that same year, then marrying each other in 1959.\nTelevision and Muppets: 1961\u20131969.\nHenson spent much of the next two decades working in commercials, talk shows, and children's projects before realizing his dream of the Muppets as \"entertainment for everybody\". The popularity of his work on \"Sam and Friends\" in the late 1950s led to a series of guest appearances on network talk and variety shows. He appeared as a guest on many shows, including \"The Steve Allen Show\", \"The Jack Paar Program\", and \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". (Sullivan introduced him as \"Jim Newsom and his Puppets\" on September 11, 1966.) These television broadcasts greatly increased his exposure, leading to hundreds of commercial appearances by Henson characters throughout the 1960s.\nAmong the most popular of Henson's commercials was a series for the local Wilkins Coffee company in Washington, D.C., created for a campaign managed by advertising manager Helen Ver Standig. Most of the Wilkins advertisements followed a similar formula: two Muppets, in this case named Wilkins and Wontkins (usually both voiced by Henson), would appear. Wilkins would extol the product while Wontkins would express his hatred for it, prompting physical retaliation from Wilkins; Wontkins might be shot with a cannon, struck in the head with a hammer or baseball bat, or have a pie thrown in his face. The Jim Henson Company has posted a short selection of them. Henson later explained, \"Till then, advertising agencies believed that the hard sell was the only way to get their message over on television. We took a very different approach. We tried to sell things by making people laugh.\"\nThe first seven-second commercials for Wilkins were an immediate hit and were later remade for other local coffee companies throughout the United States, such as Community Coffee, Red Diamond Coffee, La Touraine Coffee, Nash's Coffee, and Jomar Instant coffee. The characters were so successful in selling coffee that soon other companies began seeking them to promote their products, such as bakeries like Merita Breads, service station chains such as Standard Oil of Ohio and the downstream assets of Marathon Oil, and beverage bottlers such as Faygo. Over 300 \"Wilkins and Wontkins\" commercials were made. The ads were primarily produced in black and white, but some color examples also exist.\nHenson sold the rights to Wilkins and Wontkins to the Wilkins Company, who allowed marketing executive John T. Brady to sell the rights to some toymakers and film studios. However, in July 1992 Brady was sued by Jim Henson Productions for unfair competition in addition to copyright and trademark infringement. The Henson company claimed that Brady was incorrectly using Henson's name and likeness in their attempts to license the characters.\nIn 1963, Henson and his wife moved to New York City where the newly formed Muppets, Inc. resided for some time. Jane quit performing to raise their children, and Henson hired writer Jerry Juhl in 1961 and puppet performer Frank Oz in 1963 to replace her. Henson credited them both with developing much of the humor and character of his Muppets. Henson and Oz developed a close friendship and a performing partnership that lasted until Henson's death; their teamwork is particularly evident in their portrayals of Bert and Ernie, Kermit and Miss Piggy, and Kermit and Fozzie Bear. In New York City, Henson formed a partnership with Bernie Brillstein, who managed Henson's career until the puppeteer's death. In the years that followed, more performers joined Henson's team, including Jerry Nelson, Richard Hunt, Dave Goelz, Steve Whitmire, Fran Brill, and Kevin Clash. In 1964, he and his family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, where they lived until 1971, when they moved to Bedford, New York.\nHenson's talk show appearances culminated when he devised Rowlf, a piano-playing anthropomorphic dog that became the first Muppet to make regular appearances on \"The Jimmy Dean Show\". Henson was so grateful for this break that he offered Jimmy Dean a 40-percent interest in his production company, but Dean declined, stating that Henson deserved all the rewards for his own work, a decision of conscience that Dean never regretted. From 1963 to 1966, Henson began exploring filmmaking and produced a series of experimental films. His nine-minute experimental film \"Time Piece\" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 1965. He produced \"The Cube\" in 1969. Around this time, he wrote the first drafts of a live-action movie script with Jerry Juhl which became \"Tale of Sand\". The script remained in the Henson Company archives until it was adapted in the 2012 graphic novel \"Jim Henson's Tale of Sand\".\nDuring this time, Henson continued to work with various companies who sought out his Muppets for advertising purposes. Among his clients were Wilson Meats, Royal Crown Cola, Claussen's Bread, La Choy, and Frito-Lay, which featured an early version of his character Cookie Monster to promote their Munchos line of potato snacks. Like the Wilkins Coffee ads of the late 1950s and early 1960s, the formula stayed fairly similar. For instance, one of the Claussen's commercials featured Kermit the Frog dangling from a window while a character named Mack asks him if he brought a loaf of the company's bread; when Kermit says he did not, Mack closes the window on Kermit's fingers and causes him to fall, suggesting he \"drop down\" to the grocery store to buy a loaf.\n\"Sesame Street\": 1969.\nIn 1969, television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and her staff at the Children's Television Workshop were impressed by the quality and creativity of the Henson-led team, so they asked Henson and staff to work full-time on \"Sesame Street\", a children's program for public television that premiered on National Educational Television on November 10, 1969. Part of the show was set aside for a series of funny, colorful puppet characters living on Sesame Street, including Grover, Cookie Monster, Bert and Ernie, Oscar the Grouch, and Big Bird. Henson performed the characters of Ernie, game-show host Guy Smiley, and Kermit, who often appeared as a roving television news reporter.\nHenson's Muppets initially appeared separately from the realistic segments on the Street, but the show was revamped to integrate the two segments, placing much greater emphasis on Henson's work. Cooney frequently praised Henson's work, and PBS called him \"the spark that ignited our fledgling broadcast service.\" The success of \"Sesame Street\" also allowed him to stop producing commercials, and he said that \"it was a pleasure to get out of that world\".\nHenson was also involved in producing various shows and animation inserts during the first two seasons. He produced a series of counting films for the numbers 1 through 10 which always ended with a baker (voiced by Henson) falling down the stairs while carrying the featured number of desserts. He also worked on a variety of inserts for the numbers 2 through 12, including the films \"Dollhouse\"; \"Number Three Ball Film\"; the stop-motions \"King of Eight\" and \"Queen of Six\"; the cut-out animation \"Eleven Cheer\"; and the film \"Nobody Counts To 10.\" He also directed the original \"C Is for Cookie\" and \"Tales from Muppetland\", a short series of TV movie specials that were comic retellings of classic fairy tales aimed at a young audience and hosted by Kermit the Frog. The series included \"Hey, Cinderella!\", \"The Frog Prince\", and \"The Muppet Musicians of Bremen\".\nExpansion of audience: 1970\u20131978.\nHenson, Oz, and his team were concerned that the company was becoming typecast solely as purveyors of children's entertainment, so they targeted an adult audience with a series of sketches on the first season of the late-night live television variety show \"Saturday Night Live\". Eleven \"Land of Gorch\" sketches were aired between October 1975 and January 1976 on NBC, with four additional appearances in March, April, May, and September 1976. Henson liked Lorne Michaels' work and wanted to be a part of it, but he ultimately concluded that \"what we were trying to do and what his writers could write for it never gelled\". The \"SNL\" writers were not comfortable writing for the characters, and they frequently disparaged Henson's creations. Michael O'Donoghue quipped, \"I won't write for felt.\"\nHenson began developing a Broadway show and a weekly television series both featuring the Muppets. The American networks rejected the series in 1976, believing that Muppets would appeal only to a child audience. Then, Henson pitched the show to British impresario Lew Grade to finance the show. The show would be shot in the United Kingdom and syndicated worldwide. That same year, he scrapped plans for his Broadway show and moved his creative team to England, where \"The Muppet Show\" began taping at ATV Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire. The show featured Kermit as host, with a variety of prominent characters, notably Miss Piggy, Gonzo the Great, and Fozzie Bear, in addition to its large cast of supporting characters such as the Muppet musicians Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem with their chaotic drummer Animal. Henson's teammates sometimes compared his role to that of Kermit: a shy, gentle boss with \"a whim of steel\" who ran things like \"an explosion in a mattress factory.\" Caroll Spinney, who performed as Big Bird, remembered that Henson would never say he did not like something. \"He would just go 'Hmm.'\u00a0... And if he liked it, he would say, 'Lovely!'\" Henson recognized Kermit as an alter ego, though he thought that Kermit was bolder than he; Henson once said of the character: \"He can say things I hold back.\"\nTransition to the big screen: 1979\u20131986.\nThe Muppets appeared in their first theatrical feature film \"The Muppet Movie\" in 1979. It was both a critical and financial success; it made $65.2\u00a0million domestically and was the 61st highest-grossing film at the time. Henson's idol Edgar Bergen died at age 75 during production of the film, and Henson dedicated it to his memory. Henson as Kermit sang \"Rainbow Connection\", and it hit number 25 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. The Henson-directed \"The Great Muppet Caper\" (1981) followed, and Henson decided to end \"The Muppet Show\" to concentrate on making films, though the Muppet characters continued to appear in television movies and specials.\nHenson also aided others in their work. During development on \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), George Lucas asked him to aid make-up artist Stuart Freeborn in the creation and articulation of Yoda. Lucas had also wanted Henson to puppeteer the character, but Henson instead suggested Frank Oz for the role; Oz performed the role and continued in the subsequent \"Star Wars\" films. Lucas lobbied unsuccessfully to have Oz nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\nIn 1982, Henson founded the Jim Henson Foundation to promote and develop the art of puppetry in the United States. Around that time, he began creating darker and more realistic fantasy films that did not feature the Muppets and displayed \"a growing, brooding interest in mortality.\" He co-directed \"The Dark Crystal\" (1982) with Oz, \"trying to go toward a sense of realism\u2014toward a reality of creatures that are actually alive\". To provide a visual style distinct from the Muppets, the puppets in \"The Dark Crystal\" were based on conceptual artwork by Brian Froud, and it was a critical success, winning several industry awards including the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film and the Grand Prize Winner at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival. The film was less financially successful in theaters, but later claimed an enormous following and revenue when it was introduced on VHS for home entertainment. Also in 1982, Henson co-founded Henson International Television with Peter Orton and Sophie Turner Laing as his partners. The company was a distribution company for children's, teens' and family television.\nHenson worked with Oz again on \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\" (1984), this time with Oz as sole director. The film grossed $25.5 million domestically of a budget of only around $8 million, and ranked as one of the top 40 films of 1984.\n\"Labyrinth\" (1986) was a fantasy that Henson directed by himself, but\u2014despite some positive reviews; \"The New York Times\" called it \"a fabulous film\"\u2014it was a commercial disappointment. This demoralized Henson; his son Brian Henson described it as \"the closest I've seen him to turning in on himself and getting quite depressed.\" The film later became a cult classic.\nIn 1984 Henson traveled to Moscow, where he made a film about Sergei Obraztsov. Henson also donated four dolls to the puppeteer to replenish the Moscow Museum of Obraztsov Puppets: Fraggle, Skeksi, Bugard, and Robin the Frog. Of the show's guests, the Henson Archivist points out that Jim Henson placed a special importance on meeting Obraztsov: \"As a teenager learning to make puppets, Jim checked out some books from the public library for instruction \u2013 one was Obraztsov\u2019s 1950 book, \"My Profession\"\"\nLast years: 1987\u20131990.\nHenson continued creating children's television, such as \"Fraggle Rock\" and the animated \"Muppet Babies\". He also continued to address darker, more mature themes with the folklore and mythology-oriented show \"The Storyteller\" (1988), which won an Emmy for Outstanding Children's Program. The next year, he returned to television with \"The Jim Henson Hour\", which mixed lighthearted Muppet fare with more risqu\u00e9 material. It was critically well-received and won him another Emmy for Outstanding Directing in a Variety or Music Program, but it was canceled after 12 episodes due to poor ratings. Henson blamed its failure on NBC's constant rescheduling.\nIn late 1989, Henson entered into negotiations to sell his company and characters (excluding those from \"Sesame Street\") to The Walt Disney Company for almost $150\u00a0million, hoping that he would \"be able to spend a lot more of my time on the creative side of things\" with Disney handling business matters. By 1990, he had completed production on the television special \"The Muppets at Walt Disney World\" and the Disney-MGM Studios attraction \"Muppet*Vision 3D\" and he was developing film ideas and a television series entitled \"Muppet High\".\nPersonal life.\nHenson and fellow puppeteer Jane Nebel were married on May 28, 1959, in a small ceremony at Jane's family home. They had five children: Lisa (born 1960), Cheryl (born 1961), Brian (born 1963), John (1965\u20132014), and Heather Henson (born 1970). Henson and his wife legally separated in 1986, but never divorced. While he had a few short relationships with other women, he remained close to Jane for the rest of his life. Jane said that Henson was so involved with his work that he had very little time to spend with her or their children. His children began working with Muppets at an early age, partly because \"one of the best ways of being around [Jim] was to work with him\", according to Cheryl. \nHenson was a strong supporter of the civil rights movement. \nHenson took an interest in the \"Seth Material\" by Jane Roberts, a series of mystical-philosophical documents which Roberts claimed to have received via supernatural means. Brian Jay Jones reports in \"Jim Henson, the Biography\", 2016, page 209: \"...on July 30 [1974], [Henson] drove to Elmira, New York, to pay his respects to Roberts and her husband. 'I find this inspired material very beautiful,' Jim\nsaid of the Seth Material. 'It puts everything into a harmonious totality that I just love.'\"\nIllness and death.\nHenson appeared with Kermit on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" in Los Angeles on May 4, 1990. This was his final television appearance. Shortly afterwards, he privately disclosed to his publicist that he was tired and had a sore throat, but he believed it was a minor illness. On May 12, Henson traveled to Ahoskie, North Carolina, with his daughter Cheryl to visit his father and stepmother. They returned to their home in New York City the following day, and Henson cancelled a Muppet recording session that had been scheduled for May 14, 1990, due to his ill health. His wife came to visit that night.\nHenson was having trouble breathing when he woke up at around 2:00\u00a0a.m. EDT on May 15, and he began coughing up blood. He suggested to his wife that he might be dying, but he did not want to take time off from his schedule to visit a hospital for his illness, feeling that it would resolve on its own. Two hours later, Henson agreed to be taken by taxi to the emergency room at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. Shortly after admission, he stopped breathing and was rushed into the intensive care unit. X-ray images of his chest revealed multiple abscesses in both of his lungs as a result of a previous streptococcal pharyngitis he had apparently had for the past few days. Henson was placed on a ventilator but quickly deteriorated over the next several hours despite increasingly aggressive treatment with multiple antibiotics. Although the medicine killed off most of the infection, it had already weakened many of Henson's organs, and he died at 1:21\u00a0a.m. the following day. He was 53 years old.\nDavid Gelmont, the hospital's intensive care unit director, announced that Henson had died from \"Streptococcus pneumoniae\", a bacterium that causes bacterial pneumonia. However, on May 29, Gelmont reclassified it as organ dysfunction resulting from streptococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by \"Streptococcus pyogenes\". Gelmont noted Henson might have been saved had he gone to the hospital just a few hours sooner. \nMedicine reporter Lawrence D. Altman of \"The New York Times\" also stated that Henson's death \"may have shocked many Americans who believed that bacterial infections no longer could kill with such swiftness.\" A lack of common familiarity with fast-developing bacterial infections, combined with the recent AIDS-related deaths of several prominent men (including Rock Hudson, Liberace, and Roy Cohn), led to a false but widespread rumor that Henson had died of AIDS. This rumor was swiftly and directly refuted by Gelmont. Frank Oz believed the stress of negotiating with Disney contributed to Henson's death, stating in a 2021 interview: \"The Disney deal is probably what killed Jim. It made him sick.\" His remains were cremated, and in 1992, his ashes were scattered near Taos, New Mexico.\nMemorials.\nNews of Henson's death spread quickly and admirers of his work responded from around the world with tributes and condolences. Many of Henson's co-stars and directors from \"Sesame Street\", the Muppets, and other works also shared their thoughts on his death. Numerous outlets covered his death alongside that of Sammy Davis Jr, who died the same day. On May 21, 1990, Henson's public memorial service was conducted in Manhattan at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. Another was conducted on July 2, at St Paul's Cathedral in London. At the former, Harry Belafonte sang \"Turn the World Around\", a song that he had debuted on \"The Muppet Show\", as each member of the congregation waved a brightly colored foam butterfly attached to a puppet performer's rod. Later, Big Bird (performed by Caroll Spinney) walked onto the stage and sang Kermit's signature song \"Bein' Green\" while fighting back tears. Dave Goelz, Frank Oz, Kevin Clash, Steve Whitmire, Jerry Nelson, and Richard Hunt sang a medley of Henson's favorite songs in their characters' voices, ending with a performance of \"Just One Person\" while performing their Muppets.\nIn accordance with Henson's wishes, no one in attendance wore black, and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band finished the service by performing \"When the Saints Go Marching In\". The funeral was described by \"Life\" as \"an epic and almost unbearably moving event\".\nLegacy.\nThe Jim Henson Company and the Jim Henson Foundation continued after his death, producing new series and specials. Jim Henson's Creature Shop also continues to create characters and special effects for both Henson-related and outside projects. Steve Whitmire, who had joined the Muppets cast in 1978, began performing Kermit the Frog six months after Henson's death. He was dismissed from the cast in October 2016, and Matt Vogel succeeded him in the role of Kermit.\nThe Children's Television Workshop was renamed Sesame Workshop, which retained the \"Sesame Street\" characters in 2000. On February 17, 2004, the Muppets and the \"Bear in the Big Blue House\" properties were sold to Disney.\nOne of Henson's last projects was the attraction \"Muppet*Vision 3D\", which opened at Disney's Hollywood Studios on May 16, 1991, exactly one year after his death. Muppet*Vision 3D at Disney's Hollywood Studios closed to guests on June 8, 2025. However, Disney cast members were given the opportunity to view the show a final time on June 10. \nThe Jim Henson Company retains the Creature Shop as well as the rest of its film and television library, including \"Fraggle Rock\", \"Farscape\", \"The Dark Crystal\", and \"Labyrinth\". Brian Jay Jones wrote the book \"Jim Henson: The Biography.\" It was released on what would have been Henson's 77th birthday, September 24, 2013.\nThe moving-image collection of Jim Henson, which contains the film work of Jim Henson and The Jim Henson Company, is held at the Academy Film Archive.\nIn 2019, the YouTube channel Defunctland released a six-part miniseries on the life and legacy of Jim Henson.\nA biopic film based on Henson's life, known as \"Muppet Man\", has been in development at Walt Disney Pictures and The Jim Henson Company since 2010. In April 2021, it was reported that Michael Mitnick was hired to rewrite the screenplay, previously written by Aaron and Jordan Kandell. Lisa Henson will serve as producer.\nIn March 2022, it was announced that Ron Howard planned to direct a documentary on Henson's life, with Brian Grazer's Imagine Entertainment collaborating with Disney Original Documentary to produce it. The project was reported to have \"the full participation and cooperation of the Henson family\". In April 2024, it was announced the documentary was titled \"Jim Henson Idea Man\". It began streaming on Disney+ on May 31, 2024.\nIn 2024, Henson was portrayed by Nicholas Braun in the biographical dramedy \"Saturday Night\", which chronicles the production of the first episode of \"Saturday Night Live\".\nHenson's characters are currently performed by the following puppeteers: Matt Vogel (Kermit the Frog), Peter Linz (Ernie, Link Hogthrob), Eric Jacobson (Guy Smiley, The Newsman), Dave Goelz (Waldorf) and Bill Barretta (Rowlf the Dog, The Swedish Chef, Dr. Teeth). \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Also known as the control column, it is the principal control device in the cockpit of many civilian and military aircraft, either as a centre stick or side-stick. It has various switches to control functions of the aircraft controlled by the Pilot and First Officer of the flight.\nJoysticks are often used to control video games, and usually have push-buttons whose state can be read by the computer. A popular variation of the joystick used on modern video game consoles is the analog stick. Joysticks are also used for controlling machines such as cranes, trucks, underwater unmanned vehicles, wheelchairs, surveillance cameras, and zero turning radius lawn mowers. Miniature finger-operated joysticks have been adopted as input devices for smaller electronic equipment such as mobile phones.\nAviation.\nJoysticks originated as controls for aircraft ailerons and elevators, and are first known to have been used as such on Louis Bleriot's Bleriot VIII aircraft of 1908, in combination with a foot-operated rudder bar for the yaw control surface on the tail.\nOrigins.\nThe name \"joystick\" is thought to originate with early 20th century French pilot Robert Esnault-Pelterie. There are also competing claims on behalf of fellow pilots Robert Loraine, James Henry Joyce, and A. E. George. Loraine is cited by the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" for using the term \"joystick\" in his diary in 1909 when he went to Pau to learn to fly at Bl\u00e9riot's school. George was a pioneer aviator who with his colleague Jobling built and flew a biplane at Newcastle in England in 1910. The George and Jobling aircraft control column is in the collection of the Discovery Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne, England.\nJoysticks were present in early planes, though their mechanical origins are uncertain. The coining of the term \"joystick\" may actually be credited to Loraine, as his is the earliest known usage of the term, although he most certainly did not invent the device.\nElectronic joysticks.\nHistory.\nThe electrical two-axis joystick was invented by C. B. Mirick at the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and patented in 1926 (U.S. Patent no. 1,597,416)\". NRL was actively developing remote controlled aircraft at the time and the joystick was possibly used to support this effort. In the awarded patent, Mirick writes: \"My control system is particularly applicable in maneuvering aircraft without a pilot.\"\nThe Germans developed an electrical two-axis joystick around 1944. The device was used as part of the Germans' \"Funkger\u00e4t\" FuG 203 \"Kehl\" radio control transmitter system used in certain German bomber aircraft, used to guide both the rocket-boosted anti-ship missile \"Henschel Hs 293\", and the unpowered pioneering precision-guided munition \"Fritz-X\", against maritime and other targets. Here, the joystick of the \"Kehl\" transmitter was used by an operator to steer the missile towards its target. This joystick had on-off switches rather than analogue sensors. Both the Hs 293 and Fritz-X used FuG 230 \"Stra\u00dfburg\" radio receivers in them to send the \"Kehl's\" control signals to the ordnance's control surfaces. A comparable joystick unit was used for the contemporary American Azon steerable munition, strictly to laterally steer the munition in the yaw axis only.\nThis German invention was picked up by someone in the team of scientists assembled at the \"Heeresversuchsanstalt\" in Peenem\u00fcnde. Here a part of the team on the German rocket program was developing the Wasserfall missile, a variant of the V-2 rocket, the first ground-to-air missile. The Wasserfall steering equipment converted the electrical signal to radio signals and transmitted these to the missile.\nIn the 1960s the use of joysticks became widespread in radio-controlled model aircraft systems such as the Kwik Fly produced by Phill Kraft (1964). The now-defunct Kraft Systems firm eventually became an important OEM supplier of joysticks to the computer industry and other users. The first use of joysticks outside the radio-controlled aircraft industry may have been in the control of powered wheelchairs, such as the Permobil (1963). During this time period NASA used joysticks as control devices as part of the Apollo missions. For example, the lunar lander test models were controlled with a joystick.\nIn many modern airliners, for example all Airbus aircraft developed from the 1980s, the joystick has received a new lease on life for flight control in the form of the \"side-stick\", a controller similar to a gaming joystick but which is used to control flight, replacing the traditional yoke. The sidestick saves weight, improves movement and visibility in the cockpit, and may be safer in an accident than the yoke.\nElectronic games.\nIn early 1968, Sega released \"MotoPolo\", an arcade electro-mechanical game with joystick controllers, used to move miniature motorbikes in any direction on the table. The same year in 1968, Ralph H. Baer developed the first prototype joystick controller for a video game, with a golf ball mounted on the joystick handle as it was intended for a golf game he was working on at the time.\nThe earliest known electronic game joystick with a fire button was released by Sega as part of their 1969 arcade game \"Missile\", a shooter simulation game that used it as part of an early dual-control scheme, where two directional buttons are used to move a motorized tank and a two-way joystick is used to shoot and steer the missile onto oncoming planes displayed on the screen; when a plane is hit, an explosion is animated on screen along with an explosion sound. In 1970, the game was released in North America as \"S.A.M.I.\" by Midway Games.\nTaito released a four-way joystick as part of their arcade racing video game \"Astro Race\" in 1973, while their 1975 multidirectional shooter \"Western Gun\" introduced dual-stick controls with one eight-way joystick for movement and the other for changing the shooting direction. In North America, it was released by Midway under the title \"Gun Fight\". In 1976, Taito released \"Interceptor\", an early first-person combat flight simulator that involved piloting a jet fighter, using an eight-way joystick to aim with a crosshair and shoot at enemy aircraft.\nThe Atari CX40 joystick, developed for the 1977 Atari Video Computer System, is a digital controller with a single fire button. The Atari joystick port was for many years the \"de facto\" standard digital joystick specification. Joysticks were commonly used as controllers in first and second generation game consoles, but they gave way to the familiar game pad with the Nintendo Entertainment System and Master System during the mid-1980s, though joysticks\u2014especially arcade-style ones\u2014were and are popular after-market add-ons for any console.\nThe Armatron, a toy robot arm introduced by Tomy in 1982, was moved by dual analog control joysticks.\nIn 1985, Sega's third-person arcade rail shooter game \"Space Harrier\" featured a true analog flight stick, used for movement. The joystick could register movement in any direction as well as measure the degree of push, which could move the player character at different speeds depending on how far the joystick was pushed in a certain direction.\nA variation of the joystick is the rotary joystick. It is a type of joystick-knob hybrid, where the joystick can be moved in various direction while at the same time being able to rotate the joystick. It is mainly used in arcade shoot 'em up games, to control both the player's eight-directional movement and the gun's 360-degree direction. It was introduced by SNK, initially with the tank shooter \"TNK III\" (1985) before it was popularized by the run and gun video game \"Ikari Warriors\" (1986). SNK later used rotary joystick controls in arcade games such as \"Guerrilla War\" (1987).\nA distinct variation of an analog joystick is a positional gun, which works differently from a light gun. Instead of using light sensors, a positional gun is essentially an analog joystick mounted in a fixed location that records the position of the gun to determine where the player is aiming on the screen. It is often used for arcade gun games, with early examples including Sega's \"Sea Devil\" in 1972; Taito's \"Attack\" in 1976; \"Cross Fire\" in 1977; and Nintendo's \"Battle Shark\" in 1978.\nDuring the 1990s, joysticks such as the CH Products Flightstick, Gravis Phoenix, Microsoft SideWinder, Logitech WingMan, and Thrustmaster FCS were in demand with PC gamers. They were considered a prerequisite for flight simulators such as \"F-16 Fighting Falcon\" and \"LHX Attack Chopper\". Joysticks became especially popular with the mainstream success of space flight simulator games like \"\" and \"Wing Commander\", as well as the \"Six degrees of freedom\" 3D shooter \"Descent\". VirPil Controls' MongoosT-50 joystick was designed to mimic the style of Russian aircraft (including the Sukhoi Su-35 and Sukhoi Su-57), unlike most flight joysticks.\nHowever, since the beginning of the 21st century, these types of games have waned in popularity and are now considered a \"dead\" genre, and with that, gaming joysticks have been reduced to niche products. In NowGamer's interview with Jim Boone, a producer at Volition Inc., he stated that \"FreeSpace 2\"'s poor sales could have been due to joysticks' being sold poorly because they were \"going out of fashion\" because more modern first-person shooters, such as \"Quake\", were \"very much about the mouse and [the] keyboard\". He went further on to state \"Before that, when we did \"Descent\" for example, it was perfectly common for people to have joysticks \u2013 we sold a lot of copies of Descent. It was around that time [when] the more modern FPS with mouse and keyboard came out, as opposed to just keyboard like \"Wolfenstein [3D]\" or something.\".\nSince the late 1990s, \"analog sticks\" (or \"thumbsticks\", due to their being controlled by one's thumbs) have become standard on controllers for video game consoles, popularized by Nintendo's Nintendo 64 controller, and have the ability to indicate the stick's displacement from its neutral position. This means that the software does not have to keep track of the position or estimate the speed at which the controls are moved. These devices usually use potentiometers to determine the position of the stick, though some newer models instead use a Hall effect sensor for greater reliability and reduced size.\nIn 1997, ThrustMaster, Inc. introduced a 3D programmable controller, which was integrated into computer games to experience flight simulations. This line adapted several aspects of NASA's RHC (Rotational Hand Controller), which is used for landing and navigation methods.\nIn 1997 the first gaming joystick with force feedback (haptics) was manufactured by CH Products under license from technology creator, Immersion Corporation. The product, called the Force FX joystick was followed by force feedback joysticks from Logitech, Thrustmaster, and others, also under license from Immersion.\nArcade sticks.\nAn arcade stick is a large-format controller for use with home consoles or computers. They use the stick-and-button configuration of some arcade cabinets, such as those with particular multi-button arrangements. For example, the six button layout of the arcade games \"Street Fighter II\" or \"Mortal Kombat\" cannot be comfortably emulated on a console joypad, so licensed home arcade sticks for these games have been manufactured for home consoles and PCs.\nHat switch.\nA hat switch is a control on some joysticks. It is also known as a POV (point of view) switch in electronic games, where it allows one to look around in one's virtual world, browse menus, etc. For example, many flight simulators use it to switch the player's views, while other games sometimes use it as a substitute for the D-pad. Computer gamepads with both an analogue stick and a D-pad usually assign POV switch scancodes to the latter.\nThe term hat switch is a shortening of the term \"coolie hat switch\", named for the similar looking headgear.\nIn a real aircraft, the hat switch may control things like aileron or elevator trim.\nCameras.\nApart from buttons, wheels and dials as well as touchscreens also miniature joysticks have been established for the efficient manual operation of cameras.\nIndustrial applications.\nIn recent times, the employment of joysticks has become commonplace in many industrial and manufacturing applications, such as cranes, assembly lines, forestry equipment, mining trucks, and excavators. In fact, the use of such joysticks is in such high demand, that it has virtually replaced the traditional mechanical control lever in nearly all modern hydraulic control systems. Additionally, most unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and submersible remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) require at least one joystick to control either the vehicle, the on-board cameras, sensors and/or manipulators.\nDue to the highly hands-on, rough nature of such applications, the industrial joystick tends to be more robust than the typical video-game controller, and able to function over a high cycle life. This led to the development and employment of Hall effect sensing to such applications in the 1980s as a means of contactless sensing. Several companies produce joysticks for industrial applications using Hall effect technology. Another technology used in joystick design is the use of strain gauges to build force transducers from which the output is proportional to the force applied rather than physical deflection. Miniature force transducers are used as additional controls on joysticks for menu selection functions.\nSome larger manufacturers of joysticks are able to customize joystick handles and grips specific to the OEM needs while small regional manufacturers often concentrate on selling standard products at higher prices to smaller OEMs.\nAssistive technology.\nSpecialist joysticks, classed as an assistive technology pointing device, are used to replace the computer mouse for people with fairly severe physical disabilities. Rather than controlling games, these joysticks control the pointer. They are often useful to people with athetoid conditions, such as cerebral palsy, who find them easier to grasp than a standard mouse. Miniature joysticks are available for people with conditions involving muscular weakness such as muscular dystrophy or motor neuron disease as well. They are also used on electric powered wheelchairs for control since they are simple and effective to use as a control method.\nNon-human use.\nIn 1996, a scientific study established that both chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys could be taught to move a pointer on a screen by using a joystick. Both have consistently managed to demonstrate \"conceptual knowledge\" of the task required of them during trials, although rhesus monkeys were notably slower to do so.\nIn 2021, another pair of researchers investigated the level of intelligence in domestic pigs by designing a joystick which could be controlled with their snout. Unlike the chimpanzees or the rhesus monkeys, none of the four pigs was able to fully meet the 1996's test criteria for \"motoric or conceptual acquisition\" of the task, but they still performed \"significantly above chance\". Notably, the pigs experienced additional difficulties in comparison to the primates, as they were all far-sighted and so may have struggled with the details on screen, and they could not move the target with a joystick without taking their eyes off the screen first.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Situated off the coast of Chile, they are composed of three main volcanic islands: Robinson Crusoe, Alejandro Selkirk, and Santa Clara. The group is part of Insular Chile.\nThe islands are primarily known for having been the home to the marooned sailor Alexander Selkirk for more than four years from 1704, which may have inspired English writer Daniel Defoe's \"Robinson Crusoe\". Most of the archipelago's present-day inhabitants reside on Robinson Crusoe Island, and mainly in the capital, San Juan Bautista, located at Cumberland Bay on the island's north coast.\nThe group of islands is part of Chile's Valpara\u00edso Region (which also includes Easter Island) and, along with the Desventuradas Islands, forms one of the nine communes of Valpara\u00edso Province. The islands are named after Juan Fern\u00e1ndez, the explorer who discovered them in the 1570s.\nGeography.\nAlejandro Selkirk is the largest of the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands at , and its highest peak, Cerro de Los Inocentes, is also the highest point of the archipelago at . The island's population was 57 in 2012. Robinson Crusoe is the second-largest island in the archipelago at ; its highest peak, El Yunque, is . The population of Robinson Crusoe was 843 in 2012. Santa Clara is in area and reaches a height of . Santa Clara is uninhabited. The maximum elevations of Juan Fern\u00e1ndez, for Robinson Crusoe and for Alejandro Selkirk, respectively, are high enough to cause the phenomenon known as K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street, which can be seen from space.\nThe islands are volcanic in origin, produced by the movement of the Nazca Plate over the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez hotspot. As the plate moved eastward over the hot spot, volcanic eruptions formed the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Ridge before being subducted under the South American continent at the Peru\u2013Chile Trench. The islands occur where the peaks of the submarine ridge have protruded above sea level. Radiometric dating indicates that Santa Clara is the oldest of the islands, at 5.8 million years old, followed by Robinson Crusoe, 3.8\u00a0\u2013 4.2 million years old, and Alexander Selkirk, 1.0\u00a0\u2013 2.4 million years old.\nThe seafloor around Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands is rich in Manganese\u2013Iron nodules, which might be of potential economic interest.\nSome consider the islands to be one of the easternmost points of Oceania, rather than an outlying region of South America. In their book \"Shore Fishes of Easter Island\", authors John E. Randall and Alfredo Cea Egana claim that the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands have \"great similarity in ichthyofauna with Oceania more so than with the nearing South America.\"\nClimate.\nThe archipelago is very diverse in climate taking into account its size, this is due to factors such as its topography which causes the temperature and precipitation regime to change depending on the area of an island. In the Archipelago according to Trewartha's climate classification the windward slopes have a subtropical climate, while areas such as the eastern tip of Robinson Crusoe Island have a Semi-arid climate and the western and leeward areas have a Mediterranean climate. The weather is moderated by the cold Humboldt Current, which flows northward to the east of the islands, and the southeast trade winds. Temperatures range from to , with an annual mean of . Higher elevations are generally cooler, with occasional frosts on Robinson Crusoe.\nAverage annual precipitation is , varying from to year to year. Much of the variability in rainfall depends on the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation. Rainfall is higher in the winter months, and varies with elevation and exposure; elevations above experience almost daily rainfall, while the western, leeward side of Robinson Crusoe and Santa Clara are quite dry.\nBiota and ecology.\nThe Juan Fern\u00e1ndez islands are home to a high percentage of rare and endemic plants and animals, and are recognized as a distinct ecoregion. The volcanic origin and remote location of the islands meant that the islands' flora and fauna had to reach the archipelago from far across the sea; as a result, the island is home to relatively few plant species and very few animal species. The closest relatives of the archipelago's plants and animals are found in the Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests ecoregions of southern South America, including the Valdivian temperate rain forests, Magellanic subpolar forests, and Desventuradas Islands.\nFlora.\nThe Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands are renowned for their unique and diverse flora, characterized by a high degree of endemism. The archipelago comprises approximately 361 species of vascular plants, including 53 ferns, 65 monocots, and 243 dicots, spanning 73 families and 219 genera. Notably, there is one endemic family (Lactoridaceae), 12 endemic genera, and 126 endemic species, resulting in an endemism rate of 11% at the generic level and 60% at the species level.\nVegetation zones on the islands generally correspond to elevation. Grassy slopes with native and introduced species cover much of the lower altitudes of Robinson Crusoe Island (Isla M\u00e1s a Tierra) and Alejandro Selkirk Island (Isla M\u00e1s Afuera), as well as nearly all of Santa Clara Island. Tall lowland forests are dominated by the largest trees in the archipelago, including Drimys confertifolia, Myrceugenia fernandeziana (on Robinson Crusoe Island), and Myrceugenia schulzei (on Alejandro Selkirk Island). All three of these species are endemic to the ecoregion and considered vulnerable.\nIn the montane forests of Robinson Crusoe Island, the understory is notably composed of tree ferns such as Thyrsopteris elegans, which form dense forests at elevations around 700 to 750 meters. These forests also include species like Dicksonia berteroana and various Blechnum species. The dominant tree species in these montane forests include endemic genera such as Cuminia, Fagara, and Rhaphithamnus.\nThe flora of the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands has been significantly impacted by invasive plant species. On Robinson Crusoe Island, invasive species such as wild blackberry (\"Rubus ulmifolius\") and maqui (\"Aristotelia chilensis\") have colonized 80\u201390% of the native forest, exerting tremendous pressure on the remaining tracts of forest and the animals that depend on it.\nFauna.\nThe Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands have a very limited fauna, with no native land mammals, reptiles, or amphibians. Seventeen land and sea-bird species breed on the islands. The island has three endemic bird species, and three endemic subspecies. Introduced fauna by humans include rats and goats. Robinson Crusoe Island is home to an endemic and endangered hummingbird, the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez firecrown (\"Sephanoides fernandensis\"). This large hummingbird, about long, is thought to number only about 500 individuals. The other endemic bird species are the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez tit-tyrant (\"Anairetes fernandezianus\") of Robinson Crusoe Island, and the Masafuera rayadito (\"Aphrastura masafuerae\") of Alejandro Selkirk Island. The islands support the entire known breeding populations of two petrel species, http:// \"Pterodroma longirostris\" (http:// status VU) and the http:// \"Pterodroma externa\" (http:// status VU). In addition, the Juan Fernandez Islands may still support a third breeding petrel species, http:// \"Pterodroma defilippiana\" (http:// status VU), whose only other known breeding grounds are on the Desventuradas Islands. The Magellanic penguin breeds on Robinson Crusoe Island within the archipelago. All three islands of the Juan Fernandez archipelago have been recognised as Important Bird Areas (IBAs) by BirdLife International.\nThe endemic Juan-Fernandez spiny lobster (without claws) lives in the marine waters (\"Jasus frontalis\"). The Juan Fern\u00e1ndez fur seal (\"Arctophoca philippii\") also lives on the islands. This species was nearly exterminated in the sixteenth to nineteenth century, but it was rediscovered in 1965. A census in 1970 found about 750 fur seals living there. Only two were sighted on the Desventuradas Islands, located some to the north. The actual population of the Desventuradas may be higher, because the species tends to hide in sea caves. There seems to be a yearly population increase of 16\u201317 percent.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nA 2008 report by archaeologists from the Australian National University states that, \"a combination of palaeoecology and archaeology in the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands showed it was unlikely there had been human activity in the islands before Europeans arrived.\" Ichthyologists Ingo Hahn and Uwe R\u00f6mer wrote in 2002, \"the geographically isolated Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands were probably untouched by man until their discovery by European sailors in 1574. It is unknown if Polynesians, or if native Americans from South America, reached or settled it at any point.\"\nDiscovery.\nThe archipelago was discovered on 22 November 1574, by the Spanish sailor Juan Fern\u00e1ndez, who was sailing south between Callao and Valpara\u00edso along a route which he also discovered, hundreds of miles west of the coast of Chile, which avoided the northerly Humboldt current. He called the islands M\u00e1s Afuera, M\u00e1s a Tierra, and Santa Clara.\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, the islands were used as a hideout for pirates and became the location of a penal colony. It was during this period that Alexander Selkirk became marooned on the islands. In the 1740s, they were visited by Commodore Anson's flotilla during his ill-fated venture to the South Seas. The location of the archipelago was fixed by Alessandro Malaspina in 1790; previous charts had differed on the location. British and American whaling vessels were regular visitors to the islands, starting with the \"London\" (Captain Joshua Coffin) in 1795.\nDuring the maritime fur trade era of the early 19th century the islands were a source of fur seal skins, and the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez fur seal was nearly driven to extinction. In his book \"Two Years Before the Mast\" (Chapter VII), Richard Henry Dana Jr. described the islands as he found them circa 1834. At this time the main island was being used as a penal colony. However, when Dr John Coulter visited it in the early 1840s, he reported the island deserted after the approximately 1000 convicts had risen up, killing the soldiers and Governor who had held them captive. The prisoners fled to mainland Chile, where \"great numbers\" were later hunted down and shot. The story appears in Coulter's book \"Adventures in the Pacific\" (1845). On 6 May 1846, a ship carrying Mormon missionaries visited the archipelago, re-stocking before travelling onward. During their stop, they buried the body of a pregnant woman, Laura Graham, who had died during a storm.\nIn 1908, the islands were visited by the Swedish Magellanic Expedition and Carl Skottsberg is believed to have been the last to have seen the \"Santalum fernandezianum\" tree alive.\nLate in 1914 the islands were the rendezvous for Admiral Maximilian von Spee's East Asia Squadron as he gathered his ships together before defeating the British under Admiral Christopher Cradock at the Battle of Coronel. Following the Royal Navy's win at the Battle of the Falkland Islands a month later, the only surviving German cruiser, , was hunted down and cornered illegally at M\u00e1s a Tierra early in 1915, although she was in Chilean territorial waters, where it was scuttled after a brief battle with British cruisers.\nIn 1966 the Chilean government renamed M\u00e1s Afuera as Alejandro Selkirk Island and M\u00e1s a Tierra as Robinson Crusoe Island, in order to promote tourism. Incidentally, Selkirk never set foot on M\u00e1s Afuera, only on M\u00e1s a Tierra. On 30 July 2007, a constitutional reform gave the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands and Easter Island the status of \"special territories\" of Chile. Pending the enactment of a charter the archipelago will continue to be governed as a commune of the Valpara\u00edso Region.\nOn 27 February 2010, a tsunami following the 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Maule, Chile struck the islands causing at least 8 deaths. Eleven people were reported as missing. Some early reports described the tsunami as being high, but later reports measured it at . Most of the town of San Juan Bautista on Robinson Crusoe Island was destroyed.\nGovernment.\nAs a commune, the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands are a third-level administrative division of Chile governed by a municipal council, headed by a mayor () who is directly elected every four years. The mayor for the term 2021\u20132024 was Pablo Andr\u00e9s Manr\u00edquez Angulo.\nWomen's rights.\nAdvocacy for women in the islands is led by the Juan Fernandez Women's Group.\nReligion.\nA Mormon church was established in the islands in the 1980s.\nTravel.\nThe islands are served by Robinson Crusoe Airfield, located on Robinson Crusoe Island.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Originally an aeronautical engineer during the Second World War, he took a second degree in genetics under the biologist J. B. S. Haldane. Maynard Smith was instrumental in the application of game theory to evolution with George R. Price, and theorised on other problems such as the evolution of sex and signalling theory.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nJohn Maynard Smith was born in London, the son of the surgeon Sidney Maynard Smith, but following his father's death in 1928, the family moved to Exmoor, where he became interested in natural history. Quite unhappy with the lack of formal science education at Eton College, Maynard Smith took it upon himself to develop an interest in Darwinian evolutionary theory and mathematics, after having read the work of old Etonian J. B. S. Haldane, whose books were in the school's library despite the bad reputation Haldane had at Eton for his communism. He became an atheist at age 14.\nOn leaving school, Maynard Smith joined the Communist Party of Great Britain and started studying engineering at Trinity College, Cambridge. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, he defied his party's line and volunteered for service. He was rejected, however, because of poor eyesight and was told to finish his engineering degree, which he did in 1941. He later quipped that \"under the circumstances, my poor eyesight was a selective advantage\u2014it stopped me getting shot\". The year of his graduation, he married Sheila Matthew, and they later had two sons and one daughter (Tony, Carol, and Julian). Between 1942 and 1947, he applied his degree to military aircraft and he worked as an aircraft stressman at factories in Coventry and \nReading.\nSecond degree.\nMaynard Smith, having decided that aircraft were \"noisy and old-fashioned\", then took a change of career, entering University College London to study fruit fly genetics under Haldane. After graduating he became a lecturer in zoology at his alma mater between 1952 and 1965, where he directed the \"Drosophila\" lab and conducted research on population genetics. He published a popular Penguin book, \"The Theory of Evolution\", in 1958 (with subsequent editions in 1966, 1975, 1993).\nHe became gradually less attracted to communism and became a less active member, finally leaving the party in 1956 like many other intellectuals, after the Soviet Union brutally suppressed the Hungarian Revolution (Haldane had left the party in 1950 after becoming similarly disillusioned). He also admitted that a research program in evolutionary biology explicitly informed by Marxism seemed to bear little fruit.\nUniversity of Sussex.\nIn 1962 he was one of the founding members of the University of Sussex and was a dean between 1965 and 1985. He subsequently became a professor emeritus. Prior to his death the building housing much of life sciences at Sussex was renamed the John Maynard Smith Building in his honour.\n\"Evolution and the Theory of Games\".\nIn 1973 Maynard Smith formalised a central concept in evolutionary game theory called the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), based on a verbal argument by George R. Price. This area of research culminated in his 1982 book \"Evolution and the Theory of Games\". The Hawk-Dove game is arguably his single most influential game theoretical model.\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1977. In 1986 he was awarded the Darwin Medal.\nEvolution of sex and other major transitions in evolution.\nMaynard Smith published a book titled \"The Evolution of Sex\" which explored in mathematical terms, the notion of the \"two-fold cost of sex\". During the late 1980s he also became interested in evolutionary transitions in individuality (ETIs) and worked with the evolutionary biologist E\u00f6rs Szathm\u00e1ry. Together they wrote an influential 1995 book \"The Major Transitions in Evolution\", a seminal work which continues to contribute to ongoing issues in evolutionary biology. A popular science version of the book, \"The Origins of Life: From the birth of life to the origin of language\", was published in 1999.\nIn 1991 he was awarded the Balzan Prize for genetics and evolution \"for his powerful analysis of evolutionary theory and of the role of sexual reproduction as a critical factor in evolution and in the survival of species; for his mathematical models applying the theory of games to evolutionary problems\" (motivation of the Balzan General Prize Committee). In 1995 he was awarded the Linnean Medal by the Linnean Society and in 1999 he was awarded the Crafoord Prize jointly with Ernst Mayr and George C. Williams. In 2001 he was awarded the Kyoto Prize.\nIn his honour the European Society for Evolutionary Biology has an award for extraordinary young evolutionary biology researchers named The John Maynard Smith Prize.\n\"Animal Signals\".\nHis final book, \"Animal Signals\", co-authored with David Harper, on signalling theory was published in 2003.\nDeath.\nHe died on 19 April 2004 sitting in a chair at home, surrounded by books. He was survived by his wife Sheila and their children.\nControversy.\nAnother evolutionary biologist, William Donald Hamilton, harboured a grievance against Maynard Smith for his handling of an article that Hamilton submitted to \"The Journal of Theoretical Biology\" in 1963, which was eventually published as two papers in July 1964. Maynard Smith acted as a reviewer of the paper after two other reviewers had been unable to understand it, and requested that Hamilton revise it into two parts due to concerns about its accessibility, later describing it as \"deeply obscure\". In March 1964, Maynard Smith published the article \"Group Selection and Kin selection\" in \"Nature\", which covered concepts from Hamilton's article. Although Maynard Smith cited an earlier paper by Hamilton published in \"The American Naturalist\", Hamilton felt Maynard Smith had not given him sufficient credit. Hamilton also objected to an anecdote included by Maynard Smith in a review published in the \"New Scientist\" in 1976 which implied Maynard Smith's mentor Haldane had understood the concept of Hamilton's inclusive fitness in the 1950s. Hamilton replied to the review suggesting that the anecdote was false, but later apologised to Maynard Smith for having doubted it\".\"\nLegacy.\nThe John Maynard Smith Archive is housed at the British Library (Add MS 86569-86840).

A member of the Republican Party, he later served as Special Counsel for the U.S. Department of Justice from 1999 to 2000 and as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations from 2004 to 2005.\nBorn in St. Louis, Missouri, Danforth graduated from Princeton University and Yale University. George H.W. Bush considered selecting him as a vice-presidential running mate in 1988, and Bush's son, George W. Bush, considered doing the same in 2000.\nEarly life and education.\nDanforth was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Dorothy (Claggett) and Donald Danforth. He is the grandson of William H. Danforth, founder of Ralston Purina. Danforth's brother, William Henry Danforth, was former chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis.\nDanforth attended St. Louis Country Day School. He graduated from Princeton University in 1958 with an A.B. in religion after completing his senior thesis, \"Christ and Meaning: An Interpretation of Reinhold Niebuhr's Christology.\" He received degrees from Yale Law School and Yale Divinity School in 1963.\nCareer.\nDanforth practiced law at the New York law firm Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell from 1964 to 1966. He was a partner at the law firm of Bryan, Cave, McPheeters and McRoberts in St. Louis from 1966 to 1968.\nBefore Danforth entered Republican politics, Missouri was a reliably Democratic state with its U.S. senators and governors usually being Democrats. Danforth's seat in the Senate was previously held by a succession of Democrats, including Thomas Hart Benton, Stuart Symington, and Harry S. Truman. \nMissouri Attorney General.\nIn 1968, Danforth was elected Missouri Attorney General, the first Republican elected to the office in 40 years, and the first from his party elected to statewide office in 22 years. Among his staff of assistant attorneys general were future Missouri Governor and U.S. Senator Kit Bond, future Missouri Governor, U.S. Senator and U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, future Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, and future federal judge D. Brook Bartlett. Danforth was reelected in 1972.\nUnited States Senate.\nElections.\nIn 1970, Danforth ran for the United States Senate for the first time, against Democratic incumbent Stuart Symington. He lost in a close race.\nIn 1976, Danforth ran to succeed Symington, who was retiring. He had little opposition in the Republican primary. The Democrats had a three-way battle among Symington's son James W. Symington, former Missouri Governor Warren Hearnes, and rising political star Congressman Jerry Litton. Litton won the primary, but he and his family were killed when the plane taking them to their victory party in Kansas City crashed on takeoff in Chillicothe, Missouri. Hearnes, who had finished second in the primary, was chosen to replace Litton as the Democratic nominee. In the general election, Danforth defeated Hearnes with nearly 57% of the vote.\nIn 1982, the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate was Harriett Woods, a relatively unknown state senator from the St. Louis suburb of University City. She was active in women's rights organizations and collected union support and was a cousin of Democratic Senator Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio. Her speeches denounced Ronald Reagan's policies so vigorously that she ran on the nickname \"Give 'em Hell, Harriett\" (a play on the famous Truman phrase). Danforth defeated Woods 51% to 49%, with Woods's pro-choice stance said to be the reason for her loss.\nIn 1988, Danforth defeated Democrat Jay Nixon, 68%\u201332%. He chose not to run for a fourth term and retired from the Senate in 1995. He was succeeded by former Missouri governor John Ashcroft. Nixon was later elected Missouri Attorney General, and, in 2008, governor of Missouri.\nIn January 2001, when Missouri Democrats opposed Ashcroft's nomination for U.S. Attorney General, Danforth's name was invoked. Former U.S. Senator Tom Eagleton reacted to the nomination by saying: \"John Danforth would have been my first choice. John Ashcroft would have been my last choice.\"\nTenure.\nDuring the 1991 Senate confirmation hearings for U.S. Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, Danforth used his clout to support Thomas, who had served Danforth during his state attorney general years and later as an aide in the Senate.\nDanforth portrayed himself as a political moderate, but voted like his right-wing Republican colleagues, including sustaining filibusters. He was once quoted as saying he joined the Republican Party for \"the same reason you sometimes choose which movie to see\u2014[it's] the one with the shortest line.\"\nDanforth is a longtime opponent of capital punishment, as he made clear on the Senate floor in 1994.\nIn 1988, George H. W. Bush's presidential campaign vetted Danforth as a potential running mate. Bush selected Indiana Senator Dan Quayle instead.\nUN Ambassador.\nOn July 1, 2004, Danforth was sworn in as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, succeeding John Negroponte, who left the post after becoming the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq in June. He is best remembered for attempts to bring peace to the Sudan but stayed at the UN for just six months. Danforth was mentioned as a successor to Secretary of State Colin Powell. Six days after the announcement that Condoleezza Rice was going to take the position, Danforth submitted his resignation on November 22, 2004, effective January 20, 2005. His resignation letter said, \"Forty-seven years ago, I married the girl of my dreams, and, at this point in my life, what is most important to me is to spend more time with her.\"\nPost-Senate career.\nPolitical activity.\nIn 1999, Democratic U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Danforth to lead an investigation into the FBI's role in the 1993 Waco Siege. Danforth appointed Democratic U.S. Attorney Edward L. Dowd Jr. for the Eastern District of Missouri as his deputy special counsel. He also hired Bryan Cave partner Thomas A. Schweich as his chief of staff. Assistant U.S. Attorney James G. Martin served as Danforth's director of investigative operations for what became known as the \"Waco Investigation\" and its resulting \"Danforth Report\".\nIn July 2000, Danforth's name was leaked as being on the short list of potential vice presidential nominees for Republican nominee George W. Bush, along with Michigan Governor John Engler, New York Governor George Pataki, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, and former U.S. Secretary of Transportation, U.S. Secretary of Labor and former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole. One week before the 2000 Republican National Convention was held in Philadelphia, campaign sources said that Dick Cheney, the man charged with leading the selection process for the nominee, had recommended Danforth. But Danforth wanted to continue living mainly in Missouri, where his family was still based, and formally declined to run for vice president on July 11, 2000. Bush ultimately selected Cheney himself. Bush wrote in his book \"Decision Points\" that Danforth would have been his choice if Cheney had not accepted; on July 28, 2000, \"The New York Times\" reported that the choice of Cheney as Bush's running mate was secretly made \"weeks\" before it was formally announced on July 25. On September 6, 2001, Bush appointed Danforth a special envoy to Sudan. He brokered a peace deal that officially ended the civil war in the South between Sudan's Islamic government and the U.S.-backed Christian rebels, but elements of that conflict still remained unresolved (as had the separate Darfur conflict). Known as the Second Sudanese Civil War, the conflict ended in January 2005 with the signing of a peace agreement.\nOn June 11, 2004, Danforth presided over the funeral of Ronald Reagan, held at Washington National Cathedral. Danforth also officiated at the funerals of \"Washington Post\" executive Katharine Graham, former United States Senator Harry Flood Byrd Jr. of Virginia, and Missouri State Auditor Tom Schweich.\nOn March 30, 2005, Danforth wrote an op-ed in \"The New York Times\" critical of the Republican party. The article began: \"By a series of recent initiatives, Republicans have transformed our party into the political arm of conservative Christians\". He also penned a June 17, 2005, piece headlined \"Onward, Moderate Christian Soldiers\". At a Log Cabin Republicans meeting on April 30, 2006, Danford publicly expressed opposition to the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have banned same sex marriages, calling it \"silly\" and comparing it to Prohibition. In 2015, Danforth and 299 other Republicans signed an amicus brief calling on the Supreme Court to legalize same-sex marriage.\nContributing to the anthology \"Our American Story\" (2019), Danforth addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative and focused on the \"great American purpose\" of \"hold[ing] together in one nation a diverse and often contentious people.\" He encouraged continued work \"to demand a functioning government where compromise is the norm, to integrate all our people into one indivisible nation, and to incorporate separated individuals into the wholeness of the community.\" Danforth is a member of the Reformers Caucus of Issue One.\nDanforth was a mentor and political supporter of Josh Hawley, who became Attorney General of Missouri in 2017 and U.S. Senator in 2019 with Danforth's encouragement; Danforth also supported Hawley's presidential ambitions. In the wake of the January 6 United States Capitol attack and Hawley's efforts to challenge the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count, Danforth said that supporting Hawley in the 2018 election \"was the worst mistake I ever made in my life\". During the 2022 United States Senate election in Missouri, Danforth headed a PAC supporting independent candidate John Wood, considered a long shot to win. Wood collected enough signatures to get on the ballot but dropped out after 50 days when Eric Schmitt won the Republican primary. Danforth spent $6 million on the effort.\nPrivate sector.\nIn 1995, following his departure from the Senate, Danforth again became a partner at the Bryan Cave law firm. As of 2021 Danforth is a partner at Dowd Bennett, a Clayton law firm just outside Saint Louis.\nIn May 2012, a group led by Danforth's son-in-law, Summitt Distributing CEO Tom Stillman, in which Danforth is a minority investor, took controlling ownership of the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League. The group acquired full ownership of the team in June 2019. Danforth has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. He is an honorary board member of the humanitarian organization Wings of Hope.\nPersonal life.\nDanforth married the former Sally Dobson in 1957. They have five children and 15 grandchildren.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

The latter, along with Isidore of Seville's \"Historia Gothorum\", is one of only two extant ancient works dealing with the early history of the Goths. Other writers, such as Procopius, wrote works on the later history of the Goths. \"Getica\" has been the object of much critical review. Jordanes wrote in Late Latin rather than the classical Ciceronian Latin. According to his own introduction, he had only three days to review what Cassiodorus had written and so he must also have relied on his own knowledge.\nLife.\nJordanes writes about himself:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Sciri, moreover, and the Sadagarii and certain of the Alani with their leader, Candac by name, received Scythia Minor and Lower Moesia. Paria, the father of my father Alanoviiamuth (that is to say, my grandfather), was secretary to this Candac as long as he lived. To his sister's son Gunthigis, also called Baza, the Master of the Soldiery, who was the son of Andag the son of Andela, who was descended from the stock of the Amali, I also, Jordanes, although an unlearned man before my conversion, was secretary. \nParia was Jordanes's paternal grandfather. Jordanes writes that he was secretary to Candac, , an otherwise unknown leader of the Alans.\nJordanes was asked by a friend to write \"Getica\" as a summary of a multi-volume history of the Goths by the statesman Cassiodorus that existed then but has since been lost. Jordanes was selected for his known interest in history and because of his own Gothic background. He had been a high-level , or secretary, of a small client state on the Roman frontier in Scythia Minor, modern southeastern Romania and northeastern Bulgaria.\nJordanes was , or secretary to Gunthigis Baza, a nephew of Candac and a magister militum of the leading Ostrogoth clan of the Amali.\nThat was (\"before my conversion\"). The nature and the details of the conversion remain obscure. The Goths had been converted with the assistance of Ulfilas (a Goth), made bishop on that account. However, the Goths had adopted Arianism. Jordanes's conversion may have been a conversion to the trinitarian Nicene Creed, which may be expressed in anti-Arianism in certain passages in \"Getica\". In the letter to Vigilius he mentions that he was awakened \u2013 \"by your questioning\".\nAlternatively, Jordanes's may mean that he had become a monk, a or a member of the clergy. Some manuscripts say that he was a bishop, and some even say bishop of Ravenna, but the name Jordanes is not known in the lists of bishops of Ravenna.\nWorks.\nJordanes wrote \"Romana\", about the history of Rome, but his best-known work is his \"Getica\", which was written in Constantinople about 551\u00a0AD.\nJordanes wrote his \"Romana\" at the behest of a certain Vigilius. Although some scholars have identified this person with Pope Vigilius, there is nothing else to support the identification besides the name. The form of address that Jordanes uses and his admonition that Vigilius \"turn to God\" would seem to rule out this identification.\nIn the preface to his \"Getica\", Jordanes writes that he is interrupting his work on the \"Romana\" at the behest of a brother Castalius, who apparently knew that Jordanes possessed the twelve volumes of the History of the Goths by Cassiodorus. Castalius wanted a short book about the subject, and Jordanes obliged with an excerpt based on memory, possibly supplemented with other material to which he had access. The \"Getica\" sets off with a geography/ethnography of the North, especially of Scandza (16\u201324).\nHe lets the history of the Goths commence with the emigration of Berig with three ships from Scandza to Gothiscandza (25, 94), in a distant past. In the pen of Jordanes, Herodotus's Getian demigod Zalmoxis becomes a king of the Goths (39). Jordanes tells how the Goths sacked \"Troy and Ilium\" just after they had recovered somewhat from the war with Agamemnon (108). They are also said to have encountered the Egyptian pharaoh Vesosis (47). The less fictional part of Jordanes's work begins when the Goths encounter Roman military forces in the third century AD. The work concludes with the defeat of the Goths by the Byzantine general Belisarius. Jordanes concludes the work by stating that he writes to honour those who were victorious over the Goths after a history spanning 2,030 years.\nControversy.\nJordanes wrongly equated the Getae with the Goths. Many historical records which originally related to Dacians and Getae were thus wrongly attributed to Goths.\nArne S\u00f8by Christensen and Michael Kulikowski argue that in his \"Getica\" Jordanes also supplemented his Gothic history with many fictional events such as a Gothic war against Egypt.\nCaracalla in 213 received the titles \"Geticus Maximus\" and \"Quasi Gothicus\" after battles with Getae and Goths.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Between 1974 and 1987, Bakker hosted the television program \"The PTL Club\" and its cable television platform, the PTL Satellite Network, with his then wife, Tammy Faye. He also developed Heritage USA, a now-defunct Christian theme park in Fort Mill, South Carolina.\nBakker was born in Muskegon, Michigan, and attended North Central University in Minneapolis, where he met Tammy Faye LaValley. The two married in 1961, left college, and became itinerant evangelists, eventually having two children. In the late 1980s, Bakker resigned from the PTL ministry over a cover-up of hush money to church secretary Jessica Hahn for an alleged rape. Subsequent revelations of accounting fraud brought about felony charges, conviction, imprisonment, and divorce. Convicted of fraud and conspiracy in 1989, he served nearly five years in prison before being paroled in 1994. Bakker later remarried and returned to televangelism, founding Morningside Church in Blue Eye, Missouri, and reestablishing the PTL ministry.\nAfter divorcing Tammy Faye in 1992, Bakker married Lori Beth Graham in 1998, and together they adopted five children. Early in his career, Bakker worked at Pat Robertson\u2019s Christian Broadcasting Network, helping to grow the network and hosting shows including The 700 Club and a children\u2019s program. He later co-founded the Trinity Broadcasting Network with Paul and Jan Crouch, but left after a short partnership due to disagreements, eventually establishing his own ministry, PTL (Praise The Lord), and the PTL Satellite Network.\nReturning to televangelism in 2003, Bakker now hosts \"The Jim Bakker Show\" with a focus on apocalyptic themes and survivalist products, while distancing himself from his earlier prosperity gospel teachings. His later years have included controversial claims, such as predicting major events and promoting unproven supplements, which drew legal action and criticism during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bakker has written several books, including \"I Was Wrong\" and \"Time Has Come: How to Prepare Now for Epic Events Ahead\".\nEarly life and education.\nJames Orsen Bakker was born in Muskegon, Michigan, the son of Raleigh Bakker and Furnia Lynette \"Furn\" Irwin. Bakker attended North Central University, a Minneapolis Bible college affiliated with the Assemblies of God, where he met fellow student Tammy Faye LaValley in 1960. Bakker worked at a restaurant in the Young-Quinlan department store in Minneapolis; Tammy Faye worked at the Three Sisters, a nearby boutique. Despite already having a fianc\u00e9e in Muskegon, Jim began courting Tammy Faye.\nThe Bakkers married on April 1, 1961, and left college to become itinerant evangelists. They had two children, Tammy Sue \"Sissy\" Bakker Chapman (born March 2, 1970) and Jamie Charles \"Jay\" Bakker (born December 18, 1975). The couple divorced on March 13, 1992. On September 4, 1998, Bakker married Lori Beth Graham, a former televangelist, fifty days after they met. In 2002, they adopted five children, siblings whom Lori had befriended in Phoenix.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nIn 1966, Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker began working at Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) in Portsmouth, Virginia, which had an audience in the low thousands at the time. The Bakkers contributed to the network's growth, hosting a children's variety show called \"Come On Over\" that employed comic routines with puppets. Due to the success of \"Come On Over\", Robertson made Bakker the host of a new prime-time talk show, \"The 700 Club\", which gradually became CBN's flagship program. The Bakkers left CBN in 1973 and, soon after, joined with Paul and Jan Crouch to help co-found the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) in California. However, this partnership lasted only eight months until a falling-out between Jim Bakker and Paul Crouch caused the Bakkers to eventually leave the new network.\nPTL.\nWhile under TBN, the Bakkers moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, where in May 1973 they launched an east coast version of \"Praise The Lord\" under TBN's umbrella. Less than a year later the Bakkers formed their own non profit organization, registered the PTL trademark, left the umbrella of TBN and the Crouches, and continued their show on 36 WRET Charlotte, 16 WGGS Greenville, South Carolina, and a few other stations. In 1975, they nationally debuted their own late night-style talk show, known as \"The PTL Club\". Bakker founded the PTL Satellite Network in 1974, which aired \"The PTL Club\" and other religious television programs through local affiliates across the U.S.\nThroughout the 1970s, Bakker built a headquarters for PTL in the Carolinas called Heritage Village. Over time, the Bakkers expanded the ministry to include the Heritage USA theme park in Fort Mill, South Carolina, which became the third most successful theme park in the U.S. at the time. Viewer contributions were estimated to exceed $1\u00a0million a week, with proceeds to expand the theme park and \"The PTL Club\"'s mission. Bakker responded to inquiries about his use of mass media by saying: \"I believe that if Jesus were alive today, he would be on TV\".\nTwo scandals brought down PTL in 1987: Bakker was accused of sexual misconduct by church secretary Jessica Hahn, which led to his resignation, and his illegal misuse of ministry funds eventually led to his imprisonment. Bakker was dismissed as an Assemblies of God minister on May 6, 1987. In 1990, the biographic television movie \"Fall from Grace\", starring Kevin Spacey as Bakker, depicted his rise and fall. On January 18, 2019, ABC's \"20/20\" aired a two-hour special, entitled \"Unfaithfully Yours\", about the PTL scandal.\nEarly investigations.\nIn 1979, Bakker and PTL came under investigation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for allegedly misusing funds raised on the air. The FCC report was finalized in 1982 and found that Bakker had raised $350,000 that he told viewers would go towards funding overseas missions but that was actually used to pay for part of Heritage USA. The report also found that the Bakkers used PTL funds for personal expenses. FCC commissioners voted four to three to drop the investigation, after which they allowed Bakker to sell the only TV station that he owned, therefore bypassing future FCC oversight. The FCC forwarded its report to the U.S. Department of Justice, which declined to press charges, citing insufficient evidence. Bakker used the controversy to raise more funds from his audience, branding the investigation a \"witch-hunt\" and asking viewers to \"give the Devil a black eye\".\nA confidential 1985 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) report found that $1.3 million in ministry funds was used for the Bakkers' personal benefit from 1980 to 1983. The report recommended that PTL be stripped of its tax-exempt status, but no action was taken until after the Jessica Hahn scandal broke in 1987. Art Harris and Michael Isikoff wrote in \"The Washington Post\" that politics may have played a role in the three government agencies taking no action against PTL despite the evidence against them, as members of the Reagan administration were not eager to go after television ministers whose evangelical followers made up their base.\nSexual misconduct and resignation.\nA $279,000 payoff for the silence of Jessica Hahn, who alleged that Bakker and former \"PTL Club\" co-host John Wesley Fletcher drugged and raped her, was paid with PTL funds through Bakker's associate Roe Messner. Bakker, who made PTL's financial decisions, allegedly kept two sets of books to conceal accounting irregularities. Reporters for \"The Charlotte Observer\", led by Charles Shepard, investigated PTL's finances and published a series of articles.\nOn March 19, 1987, after the disclosure of a payoff to Hahn, Bakker resigned from PTL. Although he acknowledged that he had a sexual encounter with Hahn at a hotel room in Clearwater, Florida, he denied raping her. Bakker was also the subject of homosexual and bisexual allegations made by Fletcher and PTL director Jay Babcock, which Bakker denied under oath. Rival televangelist John Ankerberg appeared on \"Larry King Live\" and made several allegations of moral impropriety against Bakker, which both Bakkers denied.\nBakker was succeeded as PTL head by the Rev. Jerry Falwell of Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Virginia. Bakker chose Falwell as his successor because he feared that fellow televangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who had initiated an Assemblies of God investigation into Bakker's sexual misconduct, was attempting to take over his ministry.\nBakker believed that Falwell would temporarily lead the ministry until the scandal died down, but on April 28, 1987, Falwell barred Bakker from returning to PTL upon hearing of allegations of illicit behavior which went beyond the Hahn allegations. Later that summer, as donations declined sharply in the wake of Bakker's resignation and the end of \"The PTL Club\", Falwell raised $20 million to keep Heritage USA solvent and took a promised water slide ride at the park. Falwell and the remaining members of the PTL board resigned in October 1987, stating that a ruling from a bankruptcy court judge made rebuilding the ministry impossible.\nIn response to the scandal, Falwell called Bakker a liar, an embezzler, a sexual deviant, and \"the greatest scab and cancer on the face of Christianity in 2,000 years of church history\". On CNN, Swaggart stated that Bakker was a \"cancer in the body of Christ\". In February 1988, Swaggart became involved in a sex scandal of his own after being caught visiting prostitutes in New Orleans. The Bakker and Swaggart scandals had a profound effect on the world of televangelism, causing greater media scrutiny of TV ministers and their finances. Falwell said that the scandals had \"strengthened broadcast evangelism and made Christianity stronger, more mature and more committed.\"\nFraud conviction and imprisonment.\n\"The PTL Club\"'s fundraising activities between 1984 and 1987 were reported by \"The Charlotte Observer\", eventually leading to criminal charges against Bakker. Bakker and his PTL associates sold $1,000 \"lifetime memberships\", entitling buyers to an annual three-night stay at a luxury hotel at Heritage USA during that period. According to the prosecution at Bakker's fraud trial, tens of thousands of memberships were sold but only one 500-room hotel was ever finished. Bakker sold \"exclusive partnerships\" which exceeded capacity, raising more than twice the money needed to build the hotel. Much of the money paid Heritage USA's operating expenses, and Bakker kept $3.4 million.\nAfter a 16-month federal grand jury probe, Bakker was indicted in 1988 on eight counts of mail fraud, 15\u00a0counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy. In 1989, after a five-week trial which began on August 28 in Charlotte, North Carolina, a jury found him guilty on all 24 counts. Judge Robert Daniel Potter sentenced Bakker to 45 years in federal prison and imposed a $500,000 fine. At the Federal Medical Center, Rochester in Rochester, Minnesota, he shared a cell with activist Lyndon LaRouche and skydiver Roger Nelson.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld Bakker's conviction on the fraud and conspiracy charges, voided Bakker's 45-year sentence and $500,000 fine and ordered a new sentencing hearing in February 1991. The court ruled that Potter's sentencing statement about Bakker, that \"those of us who do have a religion are sick of being saps for money-grubbing preachers and priests\", was evidence that the judge had injected his religious beliefs into Bakker's sentence.\nA sentence-reduction hearing was held on November 16, 1992, and Bakker's sentence was reduced to eight years. In August\u00a01993, he was transferred to a minimum-security federal prison in Jesup, Georgia. Bakker was paroled in July 1994, after serving almost five years of his sentence. His son, Jay, spearheaded a letter-writing campaign to the parole board advocating leniency. Celebrity lawyer Alan Dershowitz acted as Bakker's parole attorney, having said that he \"would guarantee that Mr.\u00a0Bakker would never again engage in the blend of religion and commerce that led to his conviction.\" Bakker was released from Federal Bureau of Prisons custody on December 1, 1994, owing $6 million to the IRS.\nReturn to televangelism.\nIn 2003, Bakker began broadcasting \"The Jim Bakker Show\" daily at Studio City Caf\u00e9 in Branson, Missouri, with his second wife Lori; it has been carried on CTN, Daystar, Folk TV, Grace Network (Canada), Daystar Television Canada, GEB America, Hope TV (Canada), Impact Network, WGN, WHT, TCT Network, The Word Network, UpliftTV, and ZLiving networks. Most of Bakker's audience receives his program on DirecTV and Dish Network.\nBakker condemned the prosperity theology in which he took part earlier in his career, and has embraced apocalypticism. His show has a millennial, survivalist focus and sells buckets of freeze-dried food, such as beans on toast, to his audience in preparation for the end of days. Elspeth Reeve wrote in \"The Atlantic\" that Bakker's \"doomsday survival gear\" is overpriced. A man named Jerry Crawford, who credits Bakker with saving his marriage, invested $25 million in a new ministry for Bakker in Blue Eye, Missouri, named Morningside USA. Production for \"The Jim Bakker Show\" moved to Morningside in 2008.\nProphecies and statements.\nIn 2013, Bakker wrote \"Time Has Come: How to Prepare Now for Epic Events Ahead\" about end-time events. Bakker has changed his views on prosperity theology. In his 1980 book \"Eight Keys to Success\", he stated, \"God wants you to be happy, God wants you to be rich, God wants you to prosper.\" In his 1996 book, \"I Was Wrong\", he admitted that the first time he actually read the Bible all the way through was in prison. Bakker also wrote that he realized that he had taken passages out of context and used them as prooftexts to support his prosperity theology.\nBakker's revived show features a number of ministers who bill themselves as \"prophets\". He now says that \"PTL\" stands for \"Prophets Talking Loud\".\nIn an October 2017 video, Bakker said that \"God will punish those\" who ridicule him; he has said that Hurricane Harvey was a judgment of God, and he blamed Hurricane Matthew on then-President Barack Obama. Bakker predicted that if then-President Donald Trump was impeached, Christians would begin a Second American Civil War. He compared the 2017 Washington train derailment to the sinking of the RMS \"Titanic\" and stated the Amtrak train derailment was a warning from God. He also claimed that he predicted the September 11 attacks of 2001, stating that he \"saw 9/11 in 1999 before New Year's Eve\" and that there would \"be terrorism\" and bombings in New York City and Washington, D.C. A few days after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, he stated that \"God came to [him] in a dream... and he was wearing camouflage, a hunting vest and had an AR-15 strapped to his back\" and that God supported Trump's plan to arm teachers. Following the death of Billy Graham on February 21, 2018, Bakker attended Graham's funeral and paid his respects, stating that Graham was the greatest preacher since Jesus, and also remarking that Graham had visited him in prison.\nOn the \"Stand in the Gap Today\" radio program, Pennsylvania Pastors Network president Sam Rohrer criticized Bakker's civil-war prediction. \"Christian Today\" criticized Bakker's show for preying on \"the most vulnerable kinds of people\" and claimed that it had \"no place on our TV screens.\"\nCOVID-19 misinformation.\nBakker sold colloidal silver supplements that he advertised as a panacea. In March\u00a02020, the office of the Attorney General of New York ordered Bakker to cease making false medicinal claims about his supplements' alleged ability to cure the 2019\u20132020 strains of coronavirus, and the Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration also sent a warning letter to Bakker about his claims regarding the supplements and coronavirus.\nMissouri attorney general Eric Schmitt and Arkansas attorney general Leslie Rutledge filed lawsuits against Bakker for allegedly pushing the supplements as a treatment for the virus. In the State lawsuit against him, Bakker is represented by former Missouri governor Jay Nixon, who has argued for the suit to be dismissed. Nixon says that the allegations made in the lawsuit are false, stating: \"Bakker is being unfairly targeted by those who want to crush his ministry and force his Christian television program off the air.\"\nIn April 2020, prohibited from receiving credit card transactions, Bakker disclosed to his viewers that his ministry was on the brink of filing for bankruptcy and urgently petitioned them for donations.\nThe following month, GEB America and World Harvest Television dropped Bakker's program from their networks after DirecTV owner AT&amp;T asked channels to reconsider airing the show. AT&amp;T made the request of its channels in response to a deplatforming campaign from the liberal Christian group Faithful America.\nOn May 8, 2020, Lori Bakker announced that Jim Bakker had suffered a stroke that his son Jay described as \"minor\". Lori stated that he would be taking a sabbatical from the program until he recovers. She blamed the stroke on Bakker's hard work on his show and wrote that he had described the criticism against him as \"the most vicious attack that he has ever experienced\". Bakker returned to his program for the first time following his stroke on July 8, 2020.\nOn June 23, 2021, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt announced the settlement of the state's lawsuit against Bakker. Bakker and Morningside Church would be prohibited from saying silver solution could \"diagnose, prevent, mitigate, treat, or cure any disease or illness\". Restitution of about $157,000 would also be paid to those who bought silver solution between February 12, 2020, and March 10, 2020.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the early 1960s, they were pioneers of the California Sound and vocal surf music styles later popularized by the Beach Boys.\nAmong their most successful songs was 1963's \"Surf City\", the first surf song to reach the number one spot on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the US. Their other charting top 10 singles were \"Baby Talk\" (1959), \"Drag City\" (1963), \"Dead Man's Curve\" (1964; inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008,) and \"The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena)\" (1964). \nIn 1972, Torrence won the Grammy Award for Best Album Cover for the psychedelic rock band Pollution's first eponymous 1971 album, and was nominated three other times in the same category for albums of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. In 2013, Torrence's design contribution of the Surf City Allstars' \"In Concert\" CD was named a Silver Award of Distinction at the Communicator Awards competition.\nEarly lives.\nWilliam Jan Berry (April 3, 1941 \u2013 March 26, 2004), was born in Los Angeles to Clara Lorentze Mustad (born September 2, 1919, Bergen, Norway \u2013 died July 9, 2009) and aeronautical engineer William L. Berry (born December 7, 1909, New York City \u2013 died December 19, 2004, Camarillo, California), He was raised in Bel Air, Los Angeles. Jan's father worked for Howard Hughes as a project manager of the \"Spruce Goose\" and flew on its only flight with Hughes.\nDean Ormsby Torrence (born ) was born in Los Angeles, the son of Natalie Ormsby (April 10, 1911 \u2013 August 10, 2008) and Maurice Dean Torrence (December 5, 1907 \u2013 November 16, 1997). His father, Maurice, was a graduate of Stanford University, and was a sales manager at the Wilshire Oil Company.\nHistory.\n1957\u201359: formation.\nBerry and Torrence met while both were students at Emerson Junior High School in Westwood, Los Angeles, and both were on the school's football team. By 1957, they were students in the class of 1958 at the nearby University High School, where again they were both on the school's football team, the Warriors. Berry and Torrence had adjoining lockers, and after football practice, they began harmonizing together in the showers with several other football players, including future actor James Brolin.\nThe Barons.\nIn order to enter a talent competition at University High School, Berry and Torrence helped form a doo-wop group known as \"The Barons\" (named after their high school's Hi-Y club, of which they were members), which was composed of fellow University High students William \"Chuck\" Steele (lead singer), Arnold P. \"Arnie\" Ginsburg (born November 19, 1939; 1st tenor), Wallace S. \"Wally\" Yagi (born July 20, 1940; 2nd tenor), John 'Sagi\" Seligman (2nd tenor), with Berry singing bass and Torrence providing falsetto.\nDuring its short duration, Sandy Nelson, Torrence's neighbor, played drums, and future Beach Boy Bruce Johnston occasionally sang and played piano. The Barons rehearsed for hours in Berry's parents' garage, where Berry's father provided an upright piano and two two-track Ampex reel-to-reel tape recorders.\nIn 1958, the Barons performed to popular acclaim at the talent competition at University High School, covering contemporary hits like \"Get a Job\", \"Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay\", and \"Short Shorts\". Following the contest, various members of the Barons drifted away, leaving only Berry and Torrence, who tried to write their own songs.\nJan &amp; Arnie.\nAfter being inspired by a poster featuring a local Hollywood burlesque performer, Virginia Lee Hicks, who was then performing as Jennie Lee, the \"Bazoom Girl\", at the New Follies Burlesk at 548 S. Main St, Los Angeles, Ginsburg wrote a tribute song, \"Jennie Lee\", that he brought to Berry and Torrence. Berry adapted the Civil War tune \"Aura Lea\" and arranged the harmonies. After weeks of practice, Berry, Ginsburg, and Torrence planned to make a demo recording in Berry's garage, but Torrence was drafted into the United States Army Reserve, forcing Berry and Ginsburg to record \"Jennie Lee\" without Torrence, with Berry's friend and fellow University High student Donald J. Altfeld (born March 18, 1940, in Los Angeles ) \"beating out the rhythm on a children's metal high chair\". The next day Berry took their recording to Radio Recorders, a small recording studio, to have it transferred to an acetate disc. Joe Lubin, Vice President and Head of A &amp; R of Arwin Records, was impressed and offered to add instruments and to release it through Arwin.\nIn March 1958, the fathers of Berry and Ginsburg signed contracts authorizing Lubin to produce, arrange, and manage their sons.\nProduced by Lubin, \"Jennie Lee\" (Arwin 108), backed with \"Gotta Get a Date\" (credited to Ginsburg, Berry &amp; Lubin), became a surprise commercial success. According to Berry biographer Mark A. Moore, \"The song (with backing vocals, plus additional instruments added by the Ernie Freeman combo) had a raucous R&amp;B flavor, with a bouncing bomp-bomp vocal hook that would become a signature from Jan on future recordings.\" Distributed by Dot Records, \"Jennie Lee\" was released in mid-April, entered the charts on May 10, 1958, the same day they appeared on ABC's \"Dick Clark Show\". \"Jennie Lee\" peaked at No.\u00a03 on the \"Cash Box\" charts on June 21, 1958, No.\u00a04 on the R&amp;B charts, and No.\u00a08 on the Billboard charts on June 30, 1958. Billy Ward and his Dominoes's R&amp;B cover of \"Jennie Lee\" reached No.\u00a055 in the Pop charts in June 1958, while other cover versions including that of Moon Mullican (Coral 9-61994) and Bobby Phillips &amp; the Toppers (Tops 45-R422-49), released in 1958 failed to chart.\nIn July 1958, Jan &amp; Arnie released their second single, \"Gas Money\" backed with \"Bonnie Lou\" (Arwin 111), both written by Berry, Ginsburg, and Altfeld. Like \"Jennie Lee\", \"Gas Money\" contained a few elements of what would later become surf music. It entered the \"Billboard\" charts on August 24, 1958, and peaked at No.\u00a081 a week later. Jan &amp; Arnie were a featured act on the Summer Dance Party that toured the US East Coast, including Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Connecticut in July 1958. By the end of the month, they traveled to Manhattan to appear on \"The Dick Clark Show\".\nOn August 24, 1958, Jan &amp; Arnie played in a live show hosted by Dick Clark that featured Bobby Darin, the Champs, Sheb Wooley, the Blossoms, the Six Teens, Jerry Wallace, Jack Jones, Rod McKuen and the Ernie Freeman Orchestra in front of nearly 12,000 fans at the first rock-n-roll show ever held at the Hollywood Bowl.\nBy September 6, 1958, Jan &amp; Arnie's third and final single, \"The Beat That Can't Be Beat\" backed with \"I Love Linda\" (Arwin 113), again composed by the Berry, Ginsburg, and Altfeld team, was released. However this single failed to chart, due in part to a lack of distribution. On October 19, 1958, Jan &amp; Arnie performed \"The Beat That Can't Be Beat\" on CBS's \"Jack Benny Show\".\nArnie Ginsburg recorded a one-off single with a band named the Rituals on the Arwin label. The single, \"Girl in Zanzibar\" b/w \"Guitarro\", was released on vinyl in January 1959, preceding Jan and Dean's first single \"Baby Talk\", released in May 1959. Other than Arnie, the single featured Richard Podolor on guitar, Sandy Nelson on drums, Bruce Johnston on piano, Dave Shostac on sax, Harper Cosby on bass, and Mike Deasy on guitar. It is unclear if the actual single was released for the general public but there are several promotional copies pressed to vinyl in existence.\nBy the end of the year, when Torrence had completed his six-month stint at Fort Ord, Ginsburg had become disenchanted with the music business. Ginsburg enrolled in the School of Architecture and Design at the University of Southern California and graduated in the field of product design in 1966. After graduation Ginsburg worked for several noted Los Angeles architects, among them Charles Eames, and in December 1973 he was granted a U.S. patent for a table he designed.\nGinsburg moved in 1975 to Santa Barbara, California, where he worked as an architectural designer. designing the innovative Ginsburg House. In September 1976, Ginsburg and Michael W. O'Neill were granted a patent for a portable batting cage.\n1959\u201362: early records.\nAfter Torrence returned from a six-month compulsory stint in the US Army Reserve, Berry and Torrence began to make music as \"Jan and Dean\". With the help of record producers Herb Alpert and Lou Adler, Jan and Dean scored a No.\u00a010 hit on the Dore label with \"Baby Talk\" (1959) (which was incorrectly labeled as Jan &amp; Arnie when it initially was released), then scored a series of hits over the next couple of years. Playing local venues, they met and performed with the Beach Boys, and discovered the appeal of the latter's \"surf sound\". By this time Berry was co-writing, arranging, and producing all of Jan and Dean's original material.\nDuring this time Berry co-wrote or arranged and produced songs for other artists outside of Jan and Dean, including the Angels (\"I Adore Him\", Top 30), the Gents, the Matadors (Sinners), Pixie (unreleased), Jill Gibson, Shelley Fabares, Deane Hawley, the Rip Chords (\"Three Window Coupe\", Top 30), and Johnny Crawford, among others.\nUnlike most other rock 'n roll acts of the period, Jan and Dean did not give music their full-time attention. They were college students, maintaining their studies while writing and recording music and making public appearances on the side. Torrence majored in advertising design in the school of architecture at USC, where he also was a member of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. Berry took science and music classes at UCLA, became a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, and entered the California College of Medicine (now the UC Irvine School of Medicine) in 1963.\n1963\u201366: peak years.\nJan and Dean reached their commercial peak in 1963 and 1964, after they met Brian Wilson. The duo scored sixteen Top 40 hits on the \"Billboard\" and \"Cash Box\" magazine charts, with a total of twenty-six chart hits over an eight-year period (1959-1966). Berry and Wilson collaborated on roughly a dozen hits and album cuts for Jan and Dean, including \"Surf City\", co-written by Jan Berry and Brian Wilson (number one, 1963). Subsequent top 10 hits included \"Drag City\" (number 10, 1964), the eerily portentous \"Dead Man's Curve\" (number 8, 1964), and \"The Little Old Lady from Pasadena\" number 3, 1964).\nIn 1964, at the height of their fame, Jan and Dean hosted and performed at \"The T.A.M.I. Show,\" a historic concert film directed by Steve Binder. The film also featured such acts as the Rolling Stones, Chuck Berry, Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers, James Brown, Billy J. Kramer &amp; the Dakotas, Marvin Gaye, the Supremes, Lesley Gore, Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles and the Beach Boys. Also in 1964, the duo performed the title track for the Columbia Pictures film \"Ride the Wild Surf\", starring Fabian Forte, Tab Hunter, Peter Brown, Shelley Fabares, and Barbara Eden. The song, penned by Jan Berry, Brian Wilson and Roger Christian, was a Top 20 national hit. The pair were also to have appeared in the film, but their roles were cut due to their association with Barry Keenan, who had engineered the Frank Sinatra Jr. kidnapping.\nJan and Dean also filmed two unreleased television pilots: \"Surf Scene\" in 1963 and \"On the Run\" in 1966. Their feature film for Paramount Pictures \"Easy Come, Easy Go\" was canceled when Berry, as well as the film's director and other crew members, were seriously injured in a railroad accident while shooting the film in Chatsworth, California, in August 1965.\nAfter the surfing craze, Jan and Dean scored two Top-30 hits in 1965: \"You Really Know How to Hurt a Guy\" got up to 27 and \"I Found a Girl\" got to 30\u2014the latter from the album \"Folk 'n Roll\". During this period, they also began to experiment with cutting-edge comedy concepts such as the original (unreleased) \"Filet of Soul\" and \"Jan &amp; Dean Meet Batman\". The former's album cover shows Berry with his leg in a cast as a result of the accident while filming \"Easy Come, Easy Go\".\nIn 1966, Jan Berry recorded \"The Universal Coward\", an angry response to Donovan\u2019s anti-war single \"Universal Soldier\"(originally written by Buffy Sainte-Marie) even though Berry never served in the military.\n1966\u201368: Berry's car wreck.\nOn April 12, 1966, Berry received severe head injuries in an automobile accident on Whittier Drive, just a short distance from Dead Man's Curve in Beverly Hills, California, two years after the song had become a hit. He was en route to a business meeting when he crashed his Corvette into a parked truck on Whittier Drive, near the intersection of Sunset Boulevard, in Beverly Hills. Berry also had separated from his girlfriend of seven years, singer-artist Jill Gibson, later a member of the Mamas &amp; the Papas for a short time, who also had co-written several songs with him. He was in a coma for more than two months before finally awakening on the morning of June 16.\nBerry recovered from brain damage and partial paralysis. He had limited use of his right arm, and had to learn to write with his left hand as well as learning to walk again.\nIn Berry's absence, Torrence released several singles on the J&amp;D Record Co. label and recorded \"Save for a Rainy Day\" in 1966, a concept album featuring all rain-themed songs. Torrence posed with Berry's brother Ken for the album cover photos. Columbia Records released one single from the project (\"Yellow Balloon\") as did the song's writer, Gary Zekley, with the group the Yellow Balloon.\n Besides his studio work, Torrence became a graphic artist, starting his own company, Kittyhawk Graphics, and designing and creating album covers and logos for other musicians and recording artists, including Harry Nilsson, Steve Martin, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Michael Nesmith, Dennis Wilson, Bruce Johnston, the Beach Boys, Diana Ross and the Supremes, Linda Ronstadt, Canned Heat, the Ventures and many others. Torrence (with Gene Brownell) won a Grammy Award for \"Album Cover of the Year\" in 1971, for the album \"Pollution\" by Pollution on Prophesy Records.\nBerry returned to the studio in April 1967, almost one year to the day after his accident. Working with Alan Wolfson, he began writing and producing music again. In December 1967, Jan and Dean signed an agreement with Warner Bros. Records. Warner issued three singles under the name \"Jan and Dean\", but a 1968 Berry-produced album for Warner Bros., the psychedelic \"Carnival of Sound\", remained unreleased until February 2010, when Rhino Records' \"Handmade\" label put out CD and vinyl compilations of all tracks recorded for \"Carnival\", along with various outtakes and remixes from the project.\nLater years.\nIn 1971, Jan and Dean released the album \"Jan &amp; Dean Anthology Album\" under the label United Artists Records. The album included many of their top hits, starting with 1958's \"Jennie Lee\" and ending with 1968's \"Vegetables\".\nBerry began to sing again in the early 1970s, touring with his Aloha band, while Dean began performing with a band called Papa Doo Run Run.\nOn August 26, 1973, Torrence was scheduled to appear at the Hollywood Palladium as part of Jim Pewter's \"Surfer's Stomp\" reunion. Torrence had recently released some Jan &amp; Dean songs with new vocal parts by Bruce Johnston (of the Beach Boys) and producer Terry Melcher under the moniker the Legendary Masked Surfers. Torrence arranged with Berry to join him lip-syncing on stage to a pre-recorded track. The two anticipated that the audience would know it was a tape recording, and they decided to make light of it during the performance. That night, they joked around and stopped lip-syncing on stage while the music continued, but the audience became angry and started booing. The duo's first live performance after Berry's accident occurred at the Palomino Nightclub in North Hollywood on June 5, 1976, ten years after the accident, as guests of Disneyland regulars Papa Doo Run Run. Their first actual multi-song concert billed as Jan and Dean took place in 1978 in New York City at the Palladium as part of the Murray the K Brooklyn Fox Reunion Show. This was followed by a handful of East Coast shows as guests of their longtime friends the Beach Boys. Four nationwide J &amp; D headlining tours followed through 1980. Berry was still suffering the effects of his 1966 accident, with partial paralysis and aphasia.\nThe duo experienced a resurgence after Paul Morantz's \"Road back from Deadman's Curve\" article appeared in \"Rolling Stone\" in 1974, writing the piece after spending extensive time with the two singers, their families, doctors and associates. Morantz first submitted the story to \"Playboy\", who recommended it to \"Rolling Stone\". He then wrote a film treatment from his story which was purchased by CBS.\nOn February 3, 1978, CBS aired a made-for-TV film about the duo titled \"Deadman's Curve\". The biopic starred Richard Hatch as Jan Berry and Bruce Davison as Dean Torrence, with cameo appearances by Dick Clark, Wolfman Jack, Mike Love of the Beach Boys, and Bruce Johnston (who at that time was temporarily out of the Beach Boys), as well as Berry himself. Near the end of the film he can be seen sitting in the audience, watching \"himself\" (Richard Hatch) perform onstage. The part of Jan and Dean's band was played by Papa Doo Run Run, which included Mark Ward and Jim Armstrong, who went on to form Jan and Dean and the Bel-Air Bandits. Johnston and Berry had known each other since high school, and had played music together in Berry's garage in Bel Air \u2014 long before Jan and Dean or the Beach Boys were formed. Following the release of the film, the duo made steps toward an official comeback that year, including touring with the Beach Boys, and performing with Papa Doo Run Run at Cupertino High School. In the Netherlands the showing on television of the movie by Veronica in August 1979 earned them a huge hit record of the re-recorded \"Surf City\" and \"Deadman's Curve\" songs as a double A-sided single record release, and a golden oldies record having \"The Little Old Lady From Pasadena\" as its flip side reached a lower position in the charts.\nIn the early 1980s, Papa Doo Run Run left to explore other performance and recording ventures. Berry struggled to overcome drug addiction. In 1979, Berry had performed over 100 concerts of Jan and Dean songs with another front man from Hawaii, Randy Ruff. Torrence also toured briefly as \"Mike &amp; Dean\", with Mike Love of the Beach Boys. Later, the duo reunited for good. In \"Phase II\" of their career, Torrence led the touring operation.\nJan and Dean continued to tour on their own throughout the 1980s, the 1990s, and into the new millennium \u2013 with 1960s nostalgia providing them with a ready audience, headlining oldies shows throughout North America. Sundazed Music reissued Torrence's \"Save for a Rainy Day\" in 1996 in CD and vinyl formats, as well as the collector's vinyl 45 rpm companion EP, \"Sounds For A Rainy Day\", featuring four instrumental versions of the album's tracks.\nBetween the 1970s and the early 2000s, Torrence issued a number of re-recordings of classic Jan and Dean and Beach Boys hits. A double album titled \"One Summer Night / Live\" was issued by Rhino Records in 1982. Torrence released the album \"Silver Summer\" with the help of Mike Love in 1985 for Jan &amp; Dean's 25th anniversary. \"Silver Summer\" was officially released as a Jan &amp; Dean album, but falsely gives credit to Berry as co-producer and singer; Berry did not contribute to the album. Torrence participated with Berry on \"Port to Paradise\", released as a cassette on the J&amp;D Records label in 1986. In 1997, after many years of hard work, Berry released a solo album called \"Second Wave\" on One Way Records. June 11, 2002, Torrence released a solo album titled \"Anthology: Legendary Masked Surfer Unmasked\".\nOn August 31, 1991, Berry married Gertie Filip at the Stardust Convention Centre in Las Vegas, Nevada. Torrence was Berry's best man at the wedding.\nBerry's death.\nBerry died on March 26, 2004, as the result of a seizure at age 62. He was an organ donor and his body was cremated. On April 18, a \"Celebration of Life\" was held in Berry's memory at the Roxy Theatre on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, California. Attendees included Torrence, Lou Adler, Jill Gibson, and Nancy Sinatra, along with many family members, friends, and musicians associated with Jan and Dean and the Beach Boys, including the original members of Papa Doo Run Run.\nIn February 2010, the Jan and Dean album \"Carnival of Sound\" was released on the Rhino Handmade label. The album cover was designed by Torrence. Along with the CD, there was a limited edition (1500 copies), which included a 10-track LP. The album was released in Europe in April 2010 in its original US form.\nIn 2012, Torrence reunited with Bruce Davison, who portrayed him in the 1978 film \"Deadman's Curve\", to perform with the Bamboo Trading Company on their \"From Kitty Hawk To Surf City\" album. The songs were \"Shrewd Awakening\" and \"Tonga Hut\", which was featured on the film \"Return of the Killer Shrews\", a sequel to the 1959 film \"The Killer Shrews\" and also \"Tweet (Don't Talk Anymore)\", \"Drinkin' In the Sunshine\", and \"Star Of The Beach\". The album also features Dean's two daughters, Jillian and Katie Torrence; the three of them were featured in the music video of \"Shrewd Awakening\".\nAfter Berry's death, Torrence began touring occasionally with the Surf City All-Stars. He serves as a spokesman for the City of Huntington Beach, California, which, thanks in part to his efforts, is nationally recognized as \"Surf City USA\". Torrence's website features\u2014among other things\u2014rare images, a complete Jan and Dean discography, a biography, and a timeline of his career with cohort Jan Berry. He currently resides in Huntington Beach, California, with his wife and two daughters.\nLegacy.\nIn 1964, Jan and Dean were signed to host what became the first multi-act rock and roll show that was edited into a motion picture designed for wide distribution. \"The T.A.M.I. Show\" became a seminal and original production \u2013 in essence one of the first rock videos \u2013 on its release in 1964. Using a high-resolution videotape process called Electronovision (transferred from television directly onto 35mm motion picture stock as a kinescope), new sound recording techniques and having a remarkable cast, \"The T.A.M.I. Show\" set the standard for all succeeding music film and video work, including many of the early videos shown by MTV 17 years later. The revolutionary technical achievements of \"The T.A.M.I. Show\" and the list of performers (including a performance by James Brown that many critics have called the best of his career) marked a high point for Jan and Dean, as they were the hosts and one of the main featured acts as well. They became one of the main faces of mid-1960s music, until Berry's auto accident two years later, through their \"T.A.M.I. Show \"appearance.\nAccording to rock critic Dave Marsh, the attitude and public persona of punk rock can be traced to Jan and Dean.\nBrian Wilson has cited Berry as having a direct impact on his own growth as a record producer.\nIn an interview conducted by Jan and Dean fan and historian David Beard for the Collectors' Choice release, \"Jan &amp; Dean, the Complete Liberty Singles\", Dean Torrence stated that he felt the duo should be in the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame: \"We have the scoreboard if you just want to compare number of hits and musical projects done. We beat 75 percent of the people in there. So what else is it? I've got to think that we were pretty irreverent when it came to the music industry. They kind of always held that against us. That's okay with me.\"\nJan and Dean were inducted into the Hollywood Rock Walk of Fame on April 12, 1996, exactly 30 years after Jan Berry had his near fatal car accident.\nOn January 28, 2023, Jan and Dean were inducted into the California Music Hall Of Fame.\nThe Who covered Jan and Dean's \"Bucket T\" on their UK EP \"Ready Steady Who\" from 1966, one of only a few songs the group performed where surf-fan Keith Moon provided the lead vocals.\nAlternative rock group the Red Hot Chili Peppers referenced the duo in their song \"Did I Let You Know\", on the album \"I'm with You\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Nehru was a principal leader of the Indian nationalist movement in the 1930s and 1940s. Upon India's independence in 1947, he served as the country's first prime minister for 16 years. Nehru promoted parliamentary democracy, secularism, and science and technology during the 1950s, powerfully influencing India's arc as a modern nation. In international affairs, he steered India clear of the two blocs of the Cold War. A well-regarded author, he wrote books such as \"Letters from a Father to His Daughter\" (1929), \"An Autobiography\" (1936) and \"The Discovery of India\" (1946), that have been read around the world.\nThe son of Motilal Nehru, a prominent lawyer and Indian nationalist, Jawaharlal Nehru was educated in England\u2014at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, and trained in the law at the Inner Temple. He became a barrister, returned to India, enrolled at the Allahabad High Court and gradually became interested in national politics, which eventually became a full-time occupation. He joined the Indian National Congress, rose to become the leader of a progressive faction during the 1920s, and eventually of the Congress, receiving the support of Mahatma Gandhi, who was to designate Nehru as his political heir. As Congress president in 1929, Nehru called for complete independence from the British Raj.\nNehru and the Congress dominated Indian politics during the 1930s. Nehru promoted the idea of the secular nation-state in the 1937 provincial elections, allowing the Congress to sweep the elections and form governments in several provinces. In September 1939, the Congress ministries resigned to protest Viceroy Lord Linlithgow's decision to join the war without consulting them. After the All India Congress Committee's Quit India Resolution of 8 August 1942, senior Congress leaders were imprisoned, and for a time, the organisation was suppressed. Nehru, who had reluctantly heeded Gandhi's call for immediate independence, and had desired instead to support the Allied war effort during World War\u00a0II, came out of a lengthy prison term to a much altered political landscape. Under Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the Muslim League had come to dominate Muslim politics in the interim. In the 1946 provincial elections, Congress won the elections, but the League won all the seats reserved for Muslims, which the British interpreted as a clear mandate for Pakistan in some form. Nehru became the interim prime minister of India in September 1946 and the League joined his government with some hesitancy in October 1946.\nUpon India's independence on 15 August 1947, Nehru gave a critically acclaimed speech, \"Tryst with Destiny\"; he was sworn in as the Dominion of India's prime minister and raised the Indian flag at the Red Fort in Delhi. On 26 January 1950, when India became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, Nehru became the Republic of India's first prime minister. He embarked on an ambitious economic, social, and political reform programme. Nehru promoted a pluralistic multi-party democracy. In foreign affairs, he led the establishment the Non-Aligned Movement, a group of nations that did not seek membership in the two main ideological blocs of the Cold War. Under Nehru's leadership, the Congress dominated national and state-level politics and won elections in 1951, 1957 and 1962. He died in office from a heart attack in 1964. His birthday is celebrated as Children's Day in India.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life and career (1889\u20131912).\nBirth and family background.\nJawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad in British India to mother Swarup Rani n\u00e9e Thussu (1868\u20131938) and father Motilal Nehru (1861\u20131931). Both parents belonged to the community of Kashmiri Pandits, or Brahmins originally from the Kashmir valley. Motilal, a self-made barrister of wealth, served as president of the Indian National Congress in 1919 and 1928. Swarup Rani, raised in a family settled in Lahore, was Motilal's second wife, the first having died in childbirth. Jawaharlal was the firstborn. Two sisters followed, the elder of which, Vijaya Lakshmi, became the first female president of the United Nations General Assembly. The younger, Krishna Hutheesing, became a noted writer, authoring several books on her brother.\nChildhood.\nNehru described his childhood as \"sheltered and uneventful\". He grew up in an atmosphere of privilege, which included life in the mansion Anand Bhavan in Allahabad. He was educated at home by private governesses and tutors. One of these was an Irishman, Ferdinand T. Brooks, who was interested in theosophy. The Irish Home Rule and Indian Home Rule leaguer Annie Besant initiated Jawaharlal into the Theosophical Society when he was thirteen. However, his interest in theosophy was not enduring, and he left the society shortly after Brooks departed as his tutor. Nehru was to write: \"For nearly three years [Brooks] was with me and in many ways, he influenced me greatly\".\nNehru's theosophical interests led him to study the Buddhist and Hindu scriptures. According to B. R. Nanda, these scriptures were Nehru's \"first introduction to the religious and cultural heritage of [India]...[They] provided Nehru the initial impulse for [his] long intellectual quest which culminated...in \"The Discovery of India\".\"\nYouth.\nNehru became an ardent nationalist during his youth. The Second Boer War and the Russo-Japanese War intensified his feelings. Of the latter he wrote, \"[The] Japanese victories [had] stirred up my enthusiasm.\u00a0...Nationalistic ideas filled my mind.\u00a0... I mused of Indian freedom and Asiatic freedom from the thraldom of Europe.\" Later, in 1905, when he had begun his institutional schooling at Harrow, a leading school in England where he was nicknamed \"Joe\", G. M. Trevelyan's Garibaldi books, which he had received as prizes for academic merit, influenced him greatly. He viewed Garibaldi as a revolutionary hero. He wrote: \"Visions of similar deeds in India came before, of [my] gallant fight for [Indian] freedom and in my mind, India and Italy got strangely mixed together.\"\nGraduation.\nNehru went to Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1907 and graduated with an honours degree in natural science in 1910. During this period, he studied politics, economics, history and literature with interest. The writings of Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, John Maynard Keynes, Bertrand Russell, Lowes Dickinson and Meredith Townsend moulded much of his political and economic thinking.\nAfter completing his degree in 1910, Nehru moved to London and studied law at the Inner Temple (one of the four Inns of Court to which English barristers must belong). During this time, he continued to study Fabian Society scholars including Beatrice Webb. He was called to the Bar in 1912.\nLegal practice.\nAfter returning to India in August 1912, Nehru enrolled at the Allahabad High Court and tried to settle down as a barrister. His father was one of the wealthiest barristers in British India, with a monthly income exceeding Rs. 10,000 (\u00a3850). Although Nehru was expected to inherit the family's lucrative practice, he had little interest in his profession, and relished neither the practice of law nor the company of lawyers. His involvement in nationalist politics was to gradually replace his legal practice. In 1945-46, he was a member of the INA Defence Committee during the INA Trials, putting on a barrister's gown and appearing in court after over twenty-five years.\nNationalist movement (1912\u20131939).\nCivil rights and home rule: 1912\u20131919.\nNehru's father, Motilal, was an important moderate leader of the Indian National Congress. The moderates believed British rule was modernising, and sought reform and more participation in government in cooperation with British authorities. However, Nehru sympathised with the Congress radicals, who promoted Swaraj, Swadesh, and boycott. The two factions had split in 1907. After returning to India in 1912, Nehru attended the annual session of the Congress at Patna. The Congress was then considered a party of moderates and elites dominated by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and Nehru was disconcerted by what he saw as \"very much an English-knowing upper-class affair\". However, Nehru agreed to raise funds for the ongoing Indian civil rights movement led by Mahatma Gandhi in South Africa. In 1916, Nehru married Kamala Kaul, who came from a Kashmiri Pandit family settled in Delhi. Their only daughter, Indira, was born in 1917. Kamala gave birth to a son in 1924, but the baby lived for only a few days.\nThe influence of moderates declined after Gokhale died in 1915. Several nationalist leaders banded together in 1916 under the leadership of Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak to voice a demand for Swaraj or self-governance. Besant and Tilak formed separate Home Rule Leagues. Nehru joined both groups, but he worked primarily with Besant, with whom he had a close relationship since childhood. He became the secretary of Besant's Home Rule League. In June 1917, the British government arrested Besant. The Congress and other organisations threatened to launch protests if she was not freed. The government was forced to release Besant in September, but the protestors successfully negotiated further concessions.\nNon-cooperation and afterwards: 1919\u20131929.\nNehru met Gandhi for the first time in 1916 at the Lucknow session of the Congress, but he had been then dissuaded by his father from being drawn into Gandhi's satyagraha politics. 1919 marked the beginning of a strong wave of nationalist activity and subsequent government repression that included the Jallianwala Bagh killings. Motilal Nehru lost his belief in constitutional reform, and joined his son in accepting Gandhi's methods and paramount leadership of the Congress. In December 1919, Nehru's father was elected president of the Indian National Congress in what is regarded as \"the first Gandhi Congress\". During the non-cooperation movement launched by Gandhi in 1920, Nehru played an influential role in directing political activities in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) as provincial Congress secretary. He was imprisoned on 6 December 1921 on charges of anti-governmental activities, marking the first of eight periods of detention between 1921 and 1945, lasting over nine years in all. In 1923, Nehru was imprisoned in Nabha, a princely state, when he went there to see the struggle that was being waged by the Sikhs against the corrupt Mahants. He was released after his sentence was unconditionally suspended by the British administration under the criminal procedure code. By 1923, Nehru had emerged as a national figure of some stature. He was elected general secretary of the Congress, president of the United Provinces Congress, and mayor of Allahabad all in the same year.\nThe non-cooperation movement was halted in 1922 as a result of the Chauri Chaura incident. Nehru's two-year term as general secretary ended after 1925, and earlier that year he resigned as mayor of Allahabad due to his disillusionment with municipal politics. In 1926, Nehru left for Europe with his wife and daughter to seek treatment for his wife's tuberculosis diagnosis. While in Europe, he was invited to attend the Congress of oppressed nationalities in Brussels, Belgium. The meeting was called to coordinate and plan a common struggle against imperialism. Nehru represented India and was elected to the Executive Council of the League against Imperialism which was born at this meeting. He made a statement in favour of complete independence for India. Nehru's stay in Europe included a visit to the Soviet Union, which sparked his interest in Marxism and socialism. Appealed by its ideas but repelled by some of its tactics, he never completely agreed with Karl Marx's ideas. However, from that time on, the benchmark of his economic view remained Marxist, adapted, where necessary, to Indian circumstances. After returning to India in December 1927, Nehru was elected to another two-year term as Congress general secretary.\nDeclaration of independence.\nNehru was one of the first leaders to demand that the Congress Party should resolve to make a complete and explicit break from all ties with the British Empire. The Madras session of Congress in 1927, approved his resolution for independence despite Gandhi's criticism. At that time, he formed the Independence for India League, a pressure group within the Congress. In 1928, Gandhi agreed to Nehru's demands and proposed a resolution that called for the British to grant Dominion status to India within two years. If the British failed to meet the deadline, the Congress would call upon all Indians to fight for complete independence. Nehru was one of the leaders who objected to the time given to the British\u2014he pressed Gandhi to demand immediate actions from the British. Gandhi brokered a further compromise by reducing the time given from two years to one. The British rejected demands for Dominion status in 1929. Nehru assumed the presidency of the Congress party during the Lahore session on 29 December 1929 and introduced a successful resolution calling for complete independence. Nehru drafted the Indian Declaration of Independence, which stated:\nWe believe that it is the inalienable right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full opportunities for growth. We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the people have a further right to alter it or abolish it. The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally, and spiritually. We believe, therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraj or complete independence.\nAt midnight on New Year's Eve 1929, Nehru hoisted the tricolour flag of India upon the banks of the Ravi in Lahore. A pledge of independence was read out, which included a readiness to withhold taxes. The massive gathering of the public attending the ceremony was asked if they agreed with it, and the majority of people were witnessed raising their hands in approval. 172 Indian members of central and provincial legislatures resigned in support of the resolution and in accordance with Indian public sentiment. The Congress asked the people of India to observe 26\u00a0January as Independence Day. Congress volunteers, nationalists, and the public hoisted the flag of India publicly across India. Plans for mass civil disobedience were also underway.\nAfter the Lahore session of the Congress in 1929, Nehru gradually emerged as the paramount leader of the Indian independence movement. Gandhi stepped back into a more spiritual role. Although Gandhi did not explicitly designate Nehru as his political heir until 1942, as early as the mid-1930s, the country saw Nehru as the natural successor to Gandhi. In 1929, Nehru had already drafted the \"Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy\" resolution that set the government agenda for an independent India. The resolution was ratified in 1931 at the Karachi session chaired by Vallabhbhai Patel.\nSalt March: 1930.\nNehru and most of the Congress leaders were ambivalent initially to Gandhi's plan to begin civil disobedience with a \"satyagraha\" aimed at the British salt tax. After the protest had gathered steam, they realised the power of salt as a symbol. Nehru remarked about the unprecedented popular response, \"It seemed as though a spring had been suddenly released\". He was arrested on 14\u00a0April 1930 while on a train from Allahabad to Raipur. Earlier, after addressing a huge meeting and leading a vast procession, he had ceremoniously manufactured some contraband salt. He was charged with breach of the salt law and sentenced to six months of imprisonment at Central Jail.\nHe nominated Gandhi to succeed him as the Congress president during his absence in jail, but Gandhi declined, and Nehru nominated his father as his successor. With Nehru's arrest, the civil disobedience acquired a new tempo, and arrests, firing on crowds and lathi charges grew to be ordinary occurrences.\nSalt satyagraha success.\nThe salt satyagraha (\"pressure for reform through passive resistance\") succeeded in attracting world attention. Indian, British, and world opinion increasingly recognised the legitimacy of the claims by the Congress party for independence. Nehru considered the salt satyagraha the high-water mark of his association with Gandhi, and felt its lasting importance was in changing the attitudes of Indians:\nOf course these movements exercised tremendous pressure on the British Government and shook the government machinery. But the real importance, to my mind, lay in the effect they had on our own people, and especially the village masses.\u00a0... Non-cooperation dragged them out of the mire and gave them self-respect and self-reliance.\u00a0... They acted courageously and did not submit so easily to unjust oppression; their outlook widened and they began to think a little in terms of India as a whole.\u00a0... It was a remarkable transformation and the Congress, under Gandhi's leadership, must have the credit for it.\nIn prison 1930\u20131935.\nOn 11 October 1930, Nehru's detention ended, but he was back in jail in less than ten days for resuming the presidency of the banned Congress. On 26 January 1931, Nehru and other prisoners were released early by Lord Irwin, who was negotiating with Gandhi. His father died on 6 February 1931. Nehru was back in jail on 26 December 1931 after violating court orders not to leave Allahabad while leading a \"no-rent\" campaign to alleviate peasant distress. On 30 August 1933, Nehru was released from prison, but the government soon moved to detain him again. On 22 December 1933, the Home Secretary sent a memo to all local governments in India:\nThe Government of India regard him [Nehru] as by far the most dangerous element at large in India, and their view is that the time has come, in accordance with their general policy of taking steps at an early stage to prevent attempts to work up mass agitation, to take action against him.\nHe was arrested in Allahabad on 12 January 1934. In August 1934, he was briefly released for eleven days to attend to his wife's ailing health. In October, he was allowed to see her again, but he turned down an early release conditional on withdrawing from politics for the duration of his sentence.\nCongress president, provincial elections: 1935\u20131939.\nIn September 1935, Nehru's wife, Kamala, became terminally ill while receiving medical treatment in Badenweiler, Germany. Nehru was released from prison early on compassionate grounds, and moved his wife to a sanatorium in Lausanne, Switzerland, where she died on 28 February 1936. While in Europe, Nehru learned that he was elected as Congress president for the coming year. He returned to India in March 1936 and led the Congress response to the Government of India Act 1935. He condemned the Act as a \"new charter of bondage\" and a \"machine with strong brakes but no engine\". He initially wanted to boycott the 1937 provincial elections, but agreed to lead the election campaign after receiving vague assurances about abstentionism from the party leaders who wished to contest. Nehru hoped to treat the election campaign as a mass outreach programme.\nDuring the campaign, Nehru was elected to another term as Congress president. The election manifesto, drafted largely by Nehru, attacked both the Act and the Communal Award that went with it. He campaigned against the Muslim League, and argued that Muslims could not be regarded as a separate nation. The Congress won most general seats, and the Muslim League fared poorly with Muslim electorates. After the elections, Nehru drafted a resolution against taking office, but there were many Congress leaders who wanted to assume power under the 1935 Act. The Congress Working Committee (CWC) under Gandhi passed a compromise resolution that authorised office acceptance, but reiterated that the fundamental objective of the Congress was the destruction of the 1935 Act.\nNehru was more popular than before with the public, but he found himself isolated at the CWC meetings due to the anti-socialist orientation of its membership. Gandhi had to personally intervene when a group of CWC members and Nehru threatened to resign and counter-resign their posts over disagreements. He became discontented with his role, especially after the death of his mother in January 1938. In February 1938, he did not stand for re-election as president, and was succeeded by Subash Chandra Bose. He left for Europe in June, stopping on the way at Alexandria, Egypt. While in Europe, Nehru became concerned with the possibility of another world war. At that time, he emphasised that, in the event of war, India's place was alongside the democracies, though he insisted India could only fight in support of Great Britain and France as a free country. After returning to India in December 1938, Nehru accepted Bose's offer to head the Planning Commission. In February 1939, he became president of the All India States Peoples Conference (AISPC), which was leading popular agitations in princely states. Nehru was not directly involved in the events that split the Congress during the Bose presidency, and unsuccessfully attempted to mediate.\nNationalist movement (1939\u20131947).\nWhen World War\u00a0II began, Viceroy Linlithgow unilaterally declared India a belligerent on the side of Britain, without consulting the elected Indian representatives. Nehru hurried back from a visit to China, announcing that, in a conflict between democracy and fascism, \"our sympathies must inevitably be on the side of democracy,\u00a0... I should like India to play its full part and throw all her resources into the struggle for a new order\".\nAfter much deliberation, the Congress under Nehru informed the government that it would co-operate with the British but on certain conditions. First, Britain must give an assurance of full independence for India after the war and allow the election of a constituent assembly to frame a new constitution; second, although the Indian armed forces would remain under the British Commander-in-chief, Indians must be included immediately in the central government and given a chance to share power and responsibility. When Nehru presented Lord Linlithgow with these demands, he chose to reject them. A deadlock was reached: \"The same old game is played again,\" Nehru wrote bitterly to Gandhi, \"the background is the same, the various epithets are the same and the actors are the same and the results must be the same\".\nOn 23 October 1939, the Congress condemned the Viceroy's attitude and called upon the Congress ministries in the various provinces to resign in protest. Before this crucial announcement, Nehru urged Jinnah and the Muslim League to join the protest, but Jinnah declined.\nCivil disobedience, Lahore Resolution, August Offer: 1940.\nIn March 1940, Muhammad Ali Jinnah passed what came to be known as the Pakistan Resolution, declaring that, \"Muslims are a nation according to any definition of a nation, and they must have their homelands, their territory and their State.\" This state was to be known as Pakistan, meaning 'Land of the Pure'. Nehru angrily declared that \"all the old problems\u00a0... pale into insignificance before the latest stand taken by the Muslim League leader in Lahore\". Linlithgow made Nehru an offer on 8\u00a0October 1940, which stated that Dominion status for India was the objective of the British government. However, it referred neither to a date nor a method to accomplish this. Only Jinnah received something more precise: \"The British would not contemplate transferring power to a Congress-dominated national government, the authority of which was denied by various elements in India's national life\".\nIn October 1940, Gandhi and Nehru, abandoning their original stand of supporting Britain, decided to launch a limited civil disobedience campaign in which leading advocates of Indian independence were selected to participate one by one. Nehru was arrested and sentenced to four years imprisonment. On 15\u00a0January 1941, Gandhi stated:\nSome say Jawaharlal and I were estranged. It will require much more than a difference of opinion to estrange us. We had differences from the time we became co-workers and yet I have said for some years and say so now that not Rajaji but Jawaharlal will be my successor. After spending a little more than a year in jail, Nehru was released, along with other Congress prisoners, three days before the bombing of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.\nJapan attacks India, Cripps' mission, Quit India: 1942.\nWhen the Japanese carried their attack through Burma (now Myanmar) to the borders of India in the spring of 1942, the British government, faced with this new military threat, decided to make some overtures to India, as Nehru had originally desired. Prime Minister Winston Churchill dispatched Sir Stafford Cripps, a member of the War Cabinet who was known to be politically close to Nehru and knew Jinnah, with proposals for a settlement of the constitutional problem. As soon as he arrived, he discovered that India was more deeply divided than he had imagined. Nehru, eager for a compromise, was hopeful; Gandhi was not. Jinnah had continued opposing the Congress: \"Pakistan is our only demand, and by God, we will have it,\" he declared in the Muslim League newspaper \"Dawn\". Cripps' mission failed as Gandhi would accept nothing less than independence. Relations between Nehru and Gandhi cooled over the latter's refusal to co-operate with Cripps, but the two later reconciled.\nIn 1942, Gandhi called on the British to leave India; Nehru, though reluctant to embarrass the allied war effort, had no alternative but to join Gandhi. Following the Quit India resolution passed by the Congress party in Bombay on 8\u00a0August 1942, the entire Congress working committee, including Gandhi and Nehru, was arrested and imprisoned. Most of the Congress working committee including Nehru, Abdul Kalam Azad, and Sardar Patel were incarcerated at the Ahmednagar Fort until 15 June 1945.\nIn prison 1943\u20131945.\nDuring the period when all the Congress leaders were in jail, the Muslim League under Jinnah grew in power. In April 1943, the League captured the governments of Bengal and, a month later, that of the North-West Frontier Province. In none of these provinces had the League previously had a majority\u2014only the arrest of Congress members made it possible. With all the Muslim-dominated provinces except Punjab under Jinnah's control, the concept of a separate Muslim State was turning into a reality. However, by 1944, Jinnah's power and prestige were waning.\nA general sympathy towards the jailed Congress leaders was developing among Muslims, and much of the blame for the disastrous Bengal famine of 1943\u201344 during which two million died had been laid on the shoulders of the province's Muslim League government. The numbers at Jinnah's meetings, once counted in thousands, soon numbered only a few hundred. In despair, Jinnah left the political scene for a stay in Kashmir. His prestige was restored unwittingly by Gandhi, who had been released from prison on medical grounds in May 1944 and had met Jinnah in Bombay in September. There, he offered the Muslim leader a plebiscite in the Muslim areas after the war to see whether they wanted to separate from the rest of India. Essentially, it was an acceptance of the principle of Pakistan\u2014but not in so many words. Jinnah demanded that the exact words be used. Gandhi refused and the talks broke down. Jinnah, however, had greatly strengthened his own position and that of the League. The most influential member of the Congress had been seen to negotiate with him on equal terms.\nCabinet mission, Interim government 1946\u20131947.\nNehru and his colleagues were released prior to the arrival of the British 1946 Cabinet Mission to India to propose plans for the transfer of power. The agreed plan in 1946 led to elections to the provincial assemblies. In turn, the members of the assemblies elected members of the Constituent Assembly. Congress won the majority of seats in the assembly and headed the interim government, with Nehru as the prime minister. The Muslim League joined the government later with Liaquat Ali Khan as the Finance member.\nPrime Minister of India (1947\u20131964).\nNehru served as prime minister for 16 years, initially as the interim prime minister, then from 1947 as the prime minister of the Dominion of India and then from 1950 as the prime minister of the Republic of India.\nRepublicanism.\nNehru showed his concern for the princely states of South Asia since 1920s. During his Presidential Address at the Lahore session in 1929, Nehru had declared that, \"The Indian States cannot live apart from the rest of India and their rulers must, unless they accept their inevitable limitations, go the way of others like them.\"\nIn July 1946, Nehru pointedly observed that no princely state could prevail militarily against the army of independent India. In January 1947, he said that independent India would not accept the divine right of kings. In May 1947, he declared that any princely state which refused to join the Constituent Assembly would be treated as an enemy state. Vallabhbhai Patel and V. P. Menon were more conciliatory towards the princes, and as the men charged with integrating the states, were successful in the task. During the drafting of the Indian constitution, many Indian leaders (except Nehru) were in favour of allowing each princely state or covenanting state to be independent as a federal state along the lines suggested originally by the Government of India Act 1935. But as the drafting of the constitution progressed, and the idea of forming a republic took concrete shape, it was decided that all the princely states/covenanting states would merge with the Indian republic.\nIn 1963, Nehru brought in legislation making it illegal to demand secession and introduced the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution which makes it necessary for those running for office to take an oath that says \"I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India\".\nIndependence, Dominion of India: 1947\u20131950.\nThe period before independence in early 1947 was impaired by outbreaks of communal violence and political disorder, and the opposition of the Muslim League led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who were demanding a separate Muslim state of Pakistan.\nIndependence.\nHe took office as the prime minister of India on 15\u00a0August and delivered his inaugural address titled \"Tryst with Destiny\".\nLong years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history when we step out from the old to the new when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn moment we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India and her people and to the still larger cause of humanity.\nAssassination of Mahatma Gandhi: 1948.\nOn 30 January 1948, Gandhi was shot while he was walking in the garden of Birla House on his way to address a prayer meeting. The assassin, Nathuram Godse, was a Hindu nationalist with links to the extremist Hindu Mahasabha party, who held Gandhi responsible for weakening India by insisting upon a payment to Pakistan. Nehru addressed the nation by radio:\nFriends and comrades, the light has gone out of our lives, and there is darkness everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me but for millions and millions in this country.\nYasmin Khan argued that Gandhi's death and funeral helped consolidate the authority of the new Indian state under Nehru and Patel. The Congress tightly controlled the epic public displays of grief over a two-week period\u2014the funeral, mortuary rituals and distribution of the martyr's ashes with millions participating in different events. The goal was to assert the power of the government, legitimise the Congress party's control and suppress all religious paramilitary groups. Nehru and Patel suppressed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Muslim National Guards, and the Khaksars, with some 200,000 arrests. Gandhi's death and funeral linked the distant state with the Indian people and helped them to understand the need to suppress religious parties during the transition to independence for the Indian people. In later years, there emerged a revisionist school of history which sought to blame Nehru for the partition of India, mostly referring to his highly centralised policies for an independent India in 1947, which Jinnah opposed in favour of a more decentralised India.\nIntegration of states and Adoption of New Constitution: 1947\u20131950.\nThe British Indian Empire, which included present-day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, was divided into two types of territories: the provinces of British India, which were governed directly by British officials responsible to the Viceroy of India; and princely states, under the rule of local hereditary rulers who recognised British suzerainty in return for local autonomy, in most cases as established by a treaty. Between 1947 and about 1950, the territories of the princely states were politically integrated into the Indian Union under Nehru and Sardar Patel. Most were merged into existing provinces; others were organised into new provinces, such as Rajputana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Bharat, and Vindhya Pradesh, made up of multiple princely states; a few, including Mysore, Hyderabad, Bhopal and Bilaspur, became separate provinces. The Government of India Act 1935 remained the constitutional law of India the pending adoption of a new Constitution.\nIn December 1946, Nehru moved the Objectives Resolution. This resolution, upon Nehru's suggestion, ultimately turned into the Preamble to the Constitution of India. The preamble is considered to be the spirit of the Constitution. The new Constitution of India, which came into force on 26\u00a0January 1950 (Republic Day), made India a sovereign democratic republic. The new republic was declared to be a \"Union of States\".\nElection of 1952.\nAfter the adoption of the constitution on 26\u00a0November 1949, the Constituent Assembly continued to act as the interim parliament until new elections. Nehru's interim cabinet consisted of 15 members from diverse communities and parties. The first elections to Indian legislative bodies (National parliament and State assemblies) under the new constitution of India were held in 1952. The Congress party under Nehru's leadership won a large majority at both state and national levels.\nTenure: 1952\u20131957.\nIn December 1953, Nehru appointed the States Reorganisation Commission to prepare for the creation of states on linguistic lines. Headed by Justice Fazal Ali, the commission itself was also known as the Fazal Ali Commission. Govind Ballabh Pant, who served as Nehru's home minister from December 1954, oversaw the commission's efforts. The commission created a report in 1955 recommending the reorganisation of India's states.\nUnder the Seventh Amendment, the existing distinction between Part A, Part B, Part C, and Part D states was abolished. The distinction between Part A and Part B states was removed, becoming known simply as \"states\". A new type of entity, the \"union territory\", replaced the classification as a Part C or Part D state. Nehru stressed commonality among Indians and promoted pan-Indianism, refusing to reorganise states on either religious or ethnic lines.\nSubsequent elections: 1957, 1962.\nIn the 1957 elections, under Nehru's leadership, the Indian National Congress easily won a second term in power, taking 371 of the 494 seats. They gained an extra seven seats (the size of the Lok Sabha had been increased by five) and their vote share increased from 45.0% to 47.8%. The INC won nearly five times more votes than the Communist Party, the second-largest party.\nIn 1962, Nehru led the Congress to victory with a diminished majority. The numbers who voted for the Communist and socialist parties grew, although some right-wing groups like Bharatiya Jana Sangh also did well.\n1961 annexation of Goa.\nAfter years of failed negotiations, Krishna Menon ordered the Indian Army to invade Portuguese-controlled Portuguese India (Goa) in 1961, after which Nehru formally annexed it to India. It increased the popularity of both in India, but he was criticised by the communist opposition in India for the use of military force.\nSino-Indian War of 1962.\nFrom 1959, in a process that accelerated in 1961, Nehru adopted the \"Forward Policy\" of setting up military outposts in disputed areas of the Sino-Indian border, including 43 outposts in territory not previously controlled by India. China attacked some of these outposts, and the Sino-Indian War began, which India lost. The war ended with China announcing a unilateral ceasefire and with its forces withdrawing to 20 kilometres behind the line of actual control of 1959.\nThe war exposed the unpreparedness of India's military, which could send only 14,000 troops to the war zone in opposition to the much larger Chinese Army, and Nehru was widely criticised for his government's insufficient attention to defence. In response, defence minister V. K. Krishna Menon resigned and Nehru sought US military aid. Nehru's improved relations with the US under John F. Kennedy proved useful during the war, as in 1962, the president of Pakistan (then closely aligned with the Americans) Ayub Khan was made to guarantee his neutrality regarding India, threatened by \"communist aggression from Red China\". India's relationship with the Soviet Union, criticised by right-wing groups supporting free-market policies, was also seemingly validated. Nehru would continue to maintain his commitment to the non-aligned movement, despite calls from some to permanently align with one ally.\nThe unpreparedness of the army was blamed on Defence Minister Menon, who \"resigned\" from his government post to allow for someone who might modernise India's military further. India's policy of weaponisation using indigenous sources and self-sufficiency began in earnest under Nehru, completed by his daughter Indira Gandhi, who later led India to a crushing military victory over rival Pakistan in 1971. Toward the end of the war, India had increased her support for Tibetan refugees and revolutionaries, some of them having settled in India, as they were fighting the same common enemy in the region. Nehru ordered the raising of an elite Indian-trained \"Tibetan Armed Force\" composed of Tibetan refugees, which served with distinction in future wars against Pakistan in 1965 and 1971.\nPopularity.\nTo date, Nehru is considered the most popular prime minister, winning three consecutive elections with around 45% of the vote. A Path\u00e9 News archive video reporting Nehru's death remarks \"Neither on the political stage nor in moral stature was his leadership ever challenged\". In his book \"Verdicts on Nehru\", Ramachandra Guha cited a contemporary account that described what Nehru's 1951\u201352 Indian general election campaign looked like:\nAlmost at every place, city, town, village or wayside halt, people had waited overnight to welcome the nation's leader. Schools and shops closed; milkmaids and cowherds had taken a holiday; the kisan and his helpmate took a temporary respite from their dawn-to-dusk programme of hard work in field and home. In Nehru's name, stocks of soda and lemonade sold out; even water became scarce ... Special trains were run from out-of-the-way places to carry people to Nehru's meetings, enthusiasts travelling not only on footboards but also on top of carriages. Scores of people fainted in milling crowds.\nIn the 1950s, Nehru was admired by world leaders such as British prime minister Winston Churchill, and US President Dwight D. Eisenhower. A letter from Eisenhower to Nehru, dated 27 November 1958, read:\nUniversally you are recognised as one of the most powerful influences for peace and conciliation in the world. I believe that because you are a world leader for peace in your individual capacity, as well as a representative of the largest neutral nation...\nIn 1955, Churchill called Nehru, \"the light of Asia\", and a greater light than Gautama Buddha. Nehru has repeatedly been described as a charismatic leader with a rare charm.\nVision and governing policies.\nAccording to Bhikhu Parekh, Nehru can be regarded as the founder of the modern Indian state. Parekh attributes this to the national philosophy Nehru formulated for India. For him, modernisation was the national philosophy, with seven goals: national unity, parliamentary democracy, industrialisation, socialism, development of the scientific temper, and non-alignment. In Parekh's opinion, the philosophy and the policies that resulted from this benefited a large section of society such as public sector workers, industrial houses, and middle and upper peasantry. However, it failed to benefit the urban and rural poor, the unemployed and the Hindu fundamentalists.\nNehru is credited with having prevented civil wars in India. Nehru convincingly succeeded in secularism and religious harmony, increasing the representation of minorities in government.\nEconomic policies.\nNehru implemented policies based on import substitution industrialisation and advocated a mixed economy where the government-controlled public sector would co-exist with the private sector. He believed the establishment of basic and heavy industry was fundamental to the development and modernisation of the Indian economy. The government, therefore, directed investment primarily into key public sector industries\u2014steel, iron, coal, and power\u2014promoting their development with subsidies and protectionist policies. Nehru's vision of an egalitarian society was \"a co-operative ideal, a one world ideal, based on social justice and economic equality\". In 1928, Nehru had affirmed that \"Our economic programme must aim at the removal of all economic inequalities\". Later in 1955, he declared that \"I also want a classless society in India and the world.\" He identified his concept of economic freedom with the country's economic development and material advancement.\nThe policy of non-alignment during the Cold War meant that Nehru received financial and technical support from both power blocs in building India's industrial base from scratch. Steel mill complexes were built at Bokaro and Rourkela with assistance from the Soviet Union and West Germany. There was substantial industrial development. The industry grew 7.0% annually between 1950 and 1965\u2014almost trebling industrial output and making India the world's seventh-largest industrial country. Nehru's critics, however, contended that India's import substitution industrialisation, which continued long after the Nehru era, weakened the international competitiveness of its manufacturing industries. India's share of world trade fell from 1.4% in 1951\u20131960 to 0.5% between 1981 and 1990. However, India's export performance is argued to have shown actual sustained improvement over the period. The volume of exports grew at an annual rate of 2.9% in 1951\u20131960 to 7.6% in 1971\u20131980.\nGDP and GNP grew 3.9 and 4.0% annually between 1950 and 1951 and 1964\u20131965. It was a radical break from the British colonial period, but the growth rates were considered anaemic at best compared to other industrial powers in Europe and East Asia. India lagged behind the miracle economies (Japan, West Germany, France, and Italy). However, this mixed development strategy allowed native industrialisation to gain ground. While India's economy grew faster than both the United Kingdom and the United States, low initial income and rapid population increase meant that growth was inadequate for any sort of catch-up with rich income nations. India saw significant improvements in health, literacy and life expectancy since its independence.\nAgriculture policies.\nUnder Nehru's leadership, the government attempted to develop India quickly by embarking on agrarian reform and rapid industrialisation. A successful land reform was introduced that abolished giant landholdings, but efforts to redistribute land by placing limits on landownership failed. Attempts to introduce large-scale cooperative farming were frustrated by landowning rural elites, who formed the core of the powerful right-wing of the Congress and had considerable political support in opposing Nehru's efforts. Agricultural production expanded until the early 1960s, as additional land was brought under cultivation and some irrigation projects began to have an effect. The establishment of agricultural universities, modelled after land-grant colleges in the United States, contributed to the development of the economy. These universities worked with high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice, initially developed in Mexico and the Philippines, that in the 1960s began the Green Revolution, an effort to diversify and increase crop production. At the same time, a series of failed monsoons would cause serious food shortages, despite the steady progress and an increase in agricultural production.\nSocial policies.\nEducation.\nNehru was a passionate advocate of education for India's children and youth, believing it essential for India's future progress. His government oversaw the establishment of many institutions of higher learning, including the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the Indian Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institutes of Management and the National Institutes of Technology. Nehru also outlined a commitment in his five-year plans to guarantee free and compulsory primary education to all of India's children. For this purpose, Nehru oversaw the creation of mass village enrolment programs and the construction of thousands of schools. Nehru also launched initiatives such as the provision of free milk and meals to children to fight malnutrition. Adult education centres and vocational and technical schools were also organised for adults, especially in the rural areas.\nHindu code bills and marriage laws.\nUnder Nehru, the Indian Parliament enacted many changes to Hindu law through the Hindu code bills to criminalise caste discrimination and increase the legal rights and social freedoms of women. The Nehru administration saw such codification as necessary to unify the Hindu community, which ideally would be a first step towards unifying the nation. They succeeded in passing four Hindu code bills in 1955\u201356: the Hindu Marriage Act, Hindu Succession Act, Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, and Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. Those who practise Sikhism, Jainism, and Buddhism are categorised as Hindus under the jurisdiction of the Code Bill.\nNehru specifically wrote Article 44 of the Indian constitution under the Directive Principles of State Policy which states: \"The State shall endeavor to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.\" The article has formed the basis of secularism in India. However, Nehru has been criticised for the inconsistent application of the law. Most notably, he allowed Muslims to keep their personal law in matters relating to marriage and inheritance. In the small state of Goa, a civil code based on the old Portuguese Family Laws was allowed to continue, and Nehru prohibited Muslim personal law. This resulted from the annexation of Goa in 1961 by India, when Nehru promised the people that their laws would be left intact. This has led to accusations of selective secularism.\nWhile Nehru exempted Muslim law from legislation and they remained unreformed, he passed the Special Marriage Act in 1954. The idea behind this act was to give everyone in India the ability to marry outside the personal law under a civil marriage. In many respects, the act was almost identical to the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, demonstrating how secularised the law regarding Hindus had become. The Special Marriage Act allowed Muslims to marry under it and keep the protections, generally beneficial to Muslim women, that could not be found in the personal law. Under the act, polygamy was illegal, and inheritance and succession would be governed by the Indian Succession Act, rather than the respective Muslim personal law. Divorce would be governed by secular law, and maintenance of a divorced wife would be along the lines set down in civil law.\nLanguage policy.\nThe Constituent assembly debated the question of national language between 1946 and 1949. Within the assembly there were two blocs, pro-Hindi and anti-Hindi. The pro-Hindi bloc was further divided between supporters of Hindustani led by Nehru, and supporters of Modern Standard Hindi based on Sanskrit. The anti-Hindi bloc was generally in favour of promoting English to an official status. Nehru stated that \"We must have our own language...but English must continue to be a most important language in India which large numbers of people learn and learn perhaps compulsorily\". After an exhaustive and divisive debate, Hindi was adopted as the official rather than national language of India in 1950, with English continuing as an associate official language for 15 years, after which Hindi would become the sole official language. The Hindi-Hindustani debate was resolved through a compromise that the official language would be called Hindi, with a directive clause that while Sanskrit would be the primary source of vocabulary, the traditional Hindustani vocabulary would also be supported. Claims of other Indian languages were upheld through the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India.\nEfforts by the Indian government to make Hindi the sole official language after 1965 were unacceptable to many non-Hindi Indian states, which wanted the continued use of English. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a descendant of Dravidar Kazhagam, led the opposition to Hindi. To allay their fears, Nehru enacted the Official Languages Act in 1963 to ensure the continuing use of English beyond 1965. The text of the Act did not satisfy the DMK and increased their scepticism that future administrations might not honour his assurances. The Congress government headed by Indira Gandhi eventually amended the Official Languages Act in 1967 to guarantee the indefinite use of Hindi and English as official languages. This effectively ensured the current \"virtual indefinite policy of bilingualism\" of the Indian Republic.\nForeign policy.\nThroughout his long tenure as the prime minister, Nehru also held the portfolio of External Affairs. His idealistic approach focused on giving India a leadership position in nonalignment. He sought to build support among the newly independent nations of Asia and Africa in opposition to the two hostile superpowers contesting the Cold War.\nThe Commonwealth.\nAfter independence, Nehru wanted to maintain good relations with Britain and other British Commonwealth countries. As prime minister of the Dominion of India, he acquiesced only after Krishna Menon's redrafting of the 1949 London Declaration, under which India agreed to remain within the Commonwealth of Nations after becoming a republic in January 1950, and to recognise the British monarch as a \"symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth\". The other nations of the Commonwealth recognised India's continuing membership of the association.\nNon-aligned movement.\nOn the international scene, Nehru was an opponent of military action and military alliances. He was a strong supporter of the United Nations, except when it tried to resolve the Kashmir question. He pioneered the policy of non-alignment and co-founded the Non-Aligned Movement of nations professing neutrality between the rival blocs of nations led by the US and the USSR. The term \"non-alignment\" was coined earlier by V. K. Krishna Menon at the United Nations in 1953 and 1954. India recognised the People's Republic of China soon after its founding (while most of the Western bloc continued relations with Taiwan). Nehru argued for its inclusion in the United Nations and refused to brand the Chinese as the aggressors in the West's conflict with Korea. He sought to establish warm and friendly relations with China in 1950 and hoped to act as an intermediary to bridge the gulf and tensions between the communist states and the Western bloc.\nNehru was a key organiser of the Bandung Conference of April 1955, which brought 29 newly independent nations together from Asia and Africa, and was designed to galvanise the nonalignment movement under Nehru's leadership. He envisioned it as his key leadership opportunity on the world stage, where he would bring together emerging nations. He was one of the key participants of the 1st Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961 in Belgrade, FPR Yugoslavia.\nDefence and nuclear policy.\nWhile averse to war, Nehru led the campaigns against Pakistan in Kashmir. He used military force to annex Hyderabad in 1948 and Goa in 1961. While laying the foundation stone of the National Defence Academy in 1949, he stated:We, who for generations had talked about and attempted in everything a peaceful way and practised non-violence, should now be, in a sense, glorifying our army, navy and air force. It means a lot. Though it is odd, yet it simply reflects the oddness of life. Though life is logical, we have to face all contingencies, and unless we are prepared to face them, we will go under. There was no greater prince of peace and apostle of non-violence than Mahatma Gandhi...but yet, he said it was better to take the sword than to surrender, fail or run away. We cannot live carefree assuming that we are safe. Human nature is such. We cannot take the risks and risk our hard-won freedom. We have to be prepared with all modern defence methods and a well-equipped army, navy, and air force.\"\nMany hailed Nehru for working to defuse global tensions and the threat of nuclear weapons after the Korean War (1950\u20131953). He commissioned the first study of the effects of nuclear explosions on human health and campaigned ceaselessly for the abolition of what he called \"these frightful engines of destruction\". He also had pragmatic reasons for promoting de-nuclearisation, fearing a nuclear arms race would lead to over-militarisation that would be unaffordable for developing countries such as his own.\nDefending Kashmir.\nAt Lord Mountbatten's urging, in 1948, Nehru had promised to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir under the auspices of the UN. Kashmir was a disputed territory between India and Pakistan, the two have gone to war over it in 1947. However, as Pakistan failed to pull back troops in accordance with the UN resolution, and as Nehru grew increasingly wary of the UN, he declined to hold a plebiscite in 1953. His policies on Kashmir and the integration of the state into India were frequently defended before the United Nations by his aide, V. K. Krishna Menon, who earned a reputation in India for his passionate speeches.\nIn 1953, Nehru orchestrated the ouster and arrest of Sheikh Abdullah, the prime minister of Kashmir, whom he had previously supported but was now suspected of harbouring separatist ambitions; Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad replaced him.\nMenon was instructed to deliver an unprecedented eight-hour speech defending India's stand on Kashmir in 1957; to date, the speech is the longest ever delivered in the United Nations Security Council, covering five hours of the 762nd meeting on 23 January, and two hours and forty-eight minutes on the 24th, reportedly concluding with Menon's collapse on the Security Council floor. During the filibuster, Nehru moved swiftly and successfully to consolidate Indian power in Kashmir (then under great unrest). Menon's passionate defence of Indian sovereignty in Kashmir enlarged his base of support in India and led to the Indian press temporarily dubbing him the \"Hero of Kashmir\". Nehru was then at the peak of his popularity in India; the only (minor) criticism came from the far right.\nChina.\nIn 1954, Nehru signed with China the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, known in India as the Panchsheel (from the Sanskrit words, \"panch\": five,\" sheel\": virtues), a set of principles to govern relations between the two states. Their first formal codification in treaty form was in an agreement between China and India in 1954, which recognised Chinese sovereignty over Tibet. They were enunciated in the preamble to the \"Agreement (with the exchange of notes) on Trade and Intercourse between Tibet Region of China and India\", which was signed at Peking on 29 April 1954. Negotiations took place in Delhi from December 1953 to April 1954 between the Delegation of the People's Republic of China (PRC) Government and the Delegation of the Indian Government on the relations between the two countries regarding the disputed territories of Aksai Chin and South Tibet. By 1957, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai had also persuaded Nehru to accept the Chinese position on Tibet, thus depriving Tibet of a possible ally, and of the possibility of receiving military aid from India. The treaty was disregarded in the 1960s, but in the 1970s, the Five Principles again came to be seen as important in China\u2013India relations, and more generally as norms of relations between states. They became widely recognised and accepted throughout the region during the premiership of Indira Gandhi and the three-year rule of the Janata Party (1977\u20131980). Although the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence were the basis of the 1954 Sino-Indian border treaty, in later years, Nehru's foreign policy suffered from increasing Chinese assertiveness over border disputes and his decision to grant asylum to the 14th Dalai Lama.\nUnited States.\nIn 1956, Nehru criticised the joint invasion of the Suez Canal by the British, French, and Israelis. His role, both as Indian prime minister and a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, was significant; he tried to be even-handed between the two sides while vigorously denouncing Anthony Eden and co-sponsors of the invasion. Nehru had a powerful ally in the US President Dwight Eisenhower who, if relatively silent publicly, went to the extent of using America's clout at the International Monetary Fund to make Britain and France back down. During the Suez crisis, Nehru's right-hand man, Menon attempted to persuade a recalcitrant Gamal Nasser to compromise with the West and was instrumental in moving Western powers towards an awareness that Nasser might prove willing to compromise.\nAssassination attempts and security.\nThere were various assassination attempts on Nehru. The first attempt was made during partition in 1947 while he was visiting the North-West Frontier Province (now in Pakistan) in a car. The second attempt came from Baburao Laxman Kochale, a knife-wielding rickshaw-puller, near Nagpur in 1955. The third attempt was a plot by Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1955. The fourth attempt took place in Bombay in 1956, and the fifth was a failed bombing attempt on train tracks in Maharashtra in 1961. Despite threats to his life, Nehru despised having too much security around him and did not like to disrupt traffic because of his movements.\nDeath.\nNehru's health began declining steadily in 1962. In the spring of 1962, he was affected with a viral infection over which he spent most of April in bed. In the next year, through 1963, he spent months recuperating in Kashmir. Some writers attribute this dramatic decline to his surprise and chagrin over the Sino-Indian War, which he perceived as a betrayal of trust. Upon his return from Dehradun on 26 May 1964, he was feeling quite comfortable and went to bed at about 23:30 as usual. He had a restful night until about 06:30. Soon after he returned from the bathroom, Nehru complained of pain in the back. He spoke to the doctors who attended to him for a brief while, and almost immediately he collapsed. He remained unconscious until he died at 13:44. His death was announced in the Lok Sabha at 14:00 local time on 27 May 1964; the cause of death was believed to be a heart attack. Draped in the Indian national Tri-colour flag, the body of Jawaharlal Nehru was placed for public viewing. \"Raghupati Raghava Rajaram\" was chanted as the body was placed on the platform. On 28 May, Nehru was cremated in accordance with Hindu rites at the Shantivan on the banks of the Yamuna, witnessed by 1.5 million mourners who had flocked into the streets of Delhi and the cremation grounds.\nUS President Lyndon B. Johnson remarked on his death:-\nHistory has already recorded his monumental contribution to the molding of a strong and independent India. And yet, it is not just as a leader of India that he has served humanity. Perhaps more than any other world leader he has given expression to man's yearning for peace. This is the issue of our age. In his fearless pursuit of a world free from war he has served all humanity.\nSoviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and the future Soviet Leader Leonid Brezhnev remarked:-\nThe name of Jawaharal Nehru enjoyed the tremendous respect and love of the Soviet people, who knew him as a tested and wise leader of the Indian people's struggle for national independence and the rebirth of their country, and as an active fighter against colonialism. Jawaharal Nehru is known as an outstanding statesman of modern times who devoted his entire life to the struggle for strengthening friendship and cooperation among peoples and for the progress of humanity. He was a passionate fighter for peace in the world and an ardent champion of principles of peaceful coexistence of states. He was the inspirer of the nonalignment policy promoted by the Indian Government. This reasonable policy won India respect and, due to it, India is now occupying a worthy place in the international arena.\nCountries such as Egypt, Cambodia, Nepal, Kuwait, Bhutan, Kingdom of Sikkim, Nepal, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq, Uganda, Malaysia, Yugoslavia, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), India and others declared national mourning over the death of Nehru.\nNehru's death left India with no clear political heir to his leadership. Lal Bahadur Shastri later succeeded Nehru as the prime minister.\nThe death was announced to the Indian parliament in words similar to Nehru's own at the time of Gandhi's assassination: \"The light is out.\" India's future prime minister and then a Rajya Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh Atal Bihari Vajpayee famously delivered Nehru an acclaimed eulogy. After Nehru's death, Vajpayee made a speech in the Rajya Sabha, hailing Nehru as Bharat Mata's \"favourite prince\" and likened him to the Hindu god Rama.\nKey cabinet members and associates.\nNehru served as the prime minister for nearly eighteen years, first as interim prime minister during 1946\u20131947 during the last year of the British Raj and then as prime minister of independent India from 15 August 1947 to 27 May 1964.\nV. K. Krishna Menon (1896\u20131974) was a close associate of Nehru, and was described as the second most powerful man in India during Nehru's tenure as prime minister. From the inception of Nehru's prime ministry, Menon carefully selected Lord Mountbatten as the only suitable candidate and presented him as such to Labour through Sir Stafford Cripps and Clement Attlee, who promptly appointed him the last Viceroy. The early governance and partition ultimately reduced to Mountbatten, Nehru, Menon, V.P. Menon, Sardar Patel, and an adamant Jinnah. Under Nehru, he served as India's high commissioner to the UK, ambassador to Ireland, ambassador-at-large and plenipotentiary, UN ambassador, minister without portfolio, \"de facto\" Foreign minister, and Union minister of defence. He was significantly involved in the annexation of Goa. He resigned after the debacle of the 1962 China War but remain a close friend of Nehru.\nB. R. Ambedkar, the law minister in the interim cabinet, also chaired the Constitution Drafting Committee.\nVallabhbhai Patel served as home minister in the interim government. He was instrumental in getting the Congress party working committee to vote for partition. He is also credited with integrating many princely states of India. Patel was a long-time comrade to Nehru but died in 1950, leaving Nehru as the unchallenged leader of India until his own death in 1964.\nSyama Prasad Mukherjee served as the first Minister for Industry and Supply in the first ministry of Nehru. After resigning from the cabinet, he founded the Bharatiya Jana Sangh in 1951, the forerunner of the Bharatiya Janata Party.\nMaulana Azad was the First Minister of Education in the Indian government Minister of Human Resource Development (until 25\u00a0September 1958, Ministry of Education). His contribution to establishing the education foundation in India is recognised by celebrating his birthday as National Education Day across India.\nJagjivan Ram became the youngest minister in Nehru's Interim Government of India, a labour minister and also a member of the Constituent Assembly of India, where, as a member of the Dalit caste, he ensured that social justice was enshrined in the Constitution. He went on to serve as a minister with various portfolios during Nehru's tenure and in Shastri and Indira Gandhi governments.\nMorarji Desai was a nationalist with anti-corruption leanings but was socially conservative, pro-business, and in favour of free enterprise reforms, as opposed to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's socialistic policies. After serving as chief minister of Bombay State, he joined Nehru's cabinet in 1956 as the finance minister of India. He held that position until 1963 when he along with other senior ministers in the Nehru cabinet resigned under the Kamaraj plan.The plan, as proposed by Madras Chief Minister K. Kamaraj, was to revert government ministers to party positions after a certain tenure and vice versa. With Nehru's age and health failing in the early 1960s, Desai was considered a possible contender for the position of Prime Minister. Later Desai alleged that Nehru used the Kamaraj Plan to remove all possible contenders from the path of his daughter, Indira Gandhi. Desai succeeded Indira Gandhi as the prime minister in 1977 when he was selected by the victorious Janata alliance as their parliamentary leader.\nGovind Ballabh Pant (1887\u20131961) was a key figure in the Indian independence movement and later a pivotal figure in the politics of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and in the Indian Government. Pant served in Nehru's cabinet as Union home minister from 1955 until his death in 1961. As home minister, his chief achievement was the re-organisation of states along linguistic lines. He was also responsible for the establishment of Hindi as the official language of the central government and a few states. During his tenure as the home minister, Pant was awarded the Bharat Ratna.\nC. D. Deshmukh was one of five members of the Planning Commission when it was constituted in 1950 by a cabinet resolution. Deshmukh succeeded John Mathai as the Union Finance Minister in 1950 after Mathai resigned in protest over the transfer of certain powers to the Planning Commission. As finance minister, Deshmukh remained a member of the Planning Commission. Deshmukh's tenure\u2014during which he delivered six budgets and an interim budget\u2014is noted for the effective management of the Indian economy and its steady growth which saw it recover from the impacts of the events of the 1940s. During Deshmukh's tenure, the State Bank of India was formed in 1955 through the nationalisation and amalgamation of the Imperial Bank with several smaller banks. He accomplished the nationalisation of insurance companies and the formation of the Life Insurance Corporation of India through the Life Insurance Corporation of India Act, 1956. Deshmukh resigned over the Government's proposal to move a bill in Parliament bifurcating Bombay State into Gujarat and Maharashtra while designating the city of Bombay a Union territory.\nIn the years following independence, Nehru frequently turned to his daughter Indira Gandhi for managing his personal affairs. Indira moved into Nehru's official residence to attend to him and became his constant companion in his travels across India and the world. She would virtually become Nehru's chief of staff. Towards the end of the 1950s, Indira Gandhi served as the president of the Congress. In that capacity, she was instrumental in getting the Communist-led Kerala State Government dismissed in 1959. Indira was elected as Congress party president in 1959, which aroused criticism for alleged nepotism, although Nehru had actually disapproved of her election, partly because he considered that it smacked of \"dynasticism\"; he said, indeed it was \"wholly undemocratic and an undesirable thing\", and refused her a position in his cabinet. Indira herself was at loggerheads with her father over policy; most notably, she used his oft-stated personal deference to the Congress Working Committee to push through the dismissal of the Communist Party of India government in the state of Kerala, over his own objections. Nehru began to be embarrassed by her ruthlessness and disregard for parliamentary tradition and was \"hurt\" by what he saw as an assertiveness with no purpose other than to stake out an identity independent of her father.\nReligious and personal beliefs.\nDescribed as a Hindu agnostic, and styling himself as a \"scientific humanist\", Nehru thought that religious taboos were preventing India from moving forward and adapting to modern conditions: \"No country or people who are slaves to dogma and dogmatic mentality can progress, and unhappily our country and people have become extraordinarily dogmatic and little-minded.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The spectacle of what is called religion, or at any rate organised religion, in India and elsewhere, has filled me with horror and I have frequently condemned it and wished to make a clean sweep of it. Almost always it seemed to stand for blind belief and reaction, dogma and bigotry, superstition, exploitation and the preservation of vested interests.\u2014\u200a\nAs a humanist, Nehru considered that his afterlife was not in some mystical heaven or reincarnation but in the practical achievements of a life lived fully with and for his fellow human beings: \"...Nor am I greatly interested in life after death. I find the problems of this life sufficiently absorbing to fill my mind,\" he wrote. In his Last Will and Testament, he wrote: \"I wish to declare with all earnestness that I do not want any religious ceremonies performed for me after my death. I do not believe in such ceremonies, and to submit to them, even as a matter of form, would be hypocrisy and an attempt to delude ourselves and others.\"\nIn his autobiography, he analysed Abrahamic and Indian religions and their impact on India. He wanted to model India as a secular country; his secularist policies remain a subject of debate mainly by the Hindutva proponents.\nNehru also believed that a world government needs to be formed for the sake of world peace.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Committee is of the opinion that future peace, security and ordered progress of the world demand a world federation of free nations, and on no other basis can the problems of the world be solved. Such a world federation would ensure the freedom of its constituent nations, the prevention of aggression and exploitation of one nation over another, the protection of national minorities, the advancement of all backward areas and peoples, and the pooling of the world\u2019s resources for the common good of all. On the establishment of such a world federation, disarmament would be practicable in all countries, national armies, navies and air forces would no longer be necessary, and a world federal defence force would keep the peace and prevent aggression. \u2026The Committee regretfully realizes, however, despite the tragic and overwhelming lessons of the war and the perils that overhang the world, the Governments of few countries are yet prepared to take this inevitable step towards world federation.\u2014\u200a\nAwards and honours.\nIn 1948, Nehru was conferred an honorary doctorate by the University of Mysore. He later received honorary doctorates from the University of Madras, Columbia University, and Keio University. The Hamburg University had awarded Nehru two honorary degrees of the Faculties of Law and Agriculture.\nIn 1955, Nehru was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour. President Rajendra Prasad awarded him the honour without taking advice from the Prime Minister and added that \"I am taking this step on my own initiative\".\nIn 1970, he was posthumously awarded with the World Peace Council Prize.\nLegacy.\nJawaharlal Nehru, next to Mahatma Gandhi, is regarded as the most significant figure of the Indian independence movement that successfully ended British rule over the Indian subcontinent. He is also noted for contributing in the independence of Libya, Indonesia and other countries.\nAs India's first Prime minister and external affairs minister, Nehru played a major role in shaping modern India's government and political culture along with the sound foreign policy. He is praised for creating a system providing universal primary education, reaching children in the farthest corners of rural India. Nehru's education policy is also credited for the development of world-class educational institutions like the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Indian Institutes of Technology, and the Indian Institutes of Management.\nFollowing the independence, Nehru popularised the credo of \"unity in diversity\" and implemented it as state policy. This proved particularly important as post-Independence differences surfaced since British withdrawal from the subcontinent prompted regional leaders to no longer relate to one another as allies against a common adversary. While differences in culture and, especially, language threatened the unity of the new nation, Nehru established programs such as the National Book Trust and the National Literary Academy which promoted the translation of regional works of literatures between languages and organised the transfer of materials between regions. In pursuit of a single, unified India, Nehru warned, \"Integrate or perish.\"\nCalled an \"architect of India\", he is widely recognised as the greatest figure of modern India after Mahatma Gandhi. On the occasion of his first death anniversary in 1965, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Lal Bahadur Shastri and others described Nehru as the greatest figure of India after Gandhi.\nWriting in 2005, Ramachandra Guha wrote that while no other Indian prime minister was ever close to the challenges that Nehru dealt with and if Nehru had died in 1958 then he would be remembered as the greatest statesman of the 20th century. However, in recent years, Nehru's reputation has seen re-emergence and he is credited for keeping India together contrary to predictions of many that the country was bound to fall apart.\nCommemoration.\nIn his lifetime, Jawaharlal Nehru enjoyed an iconic status in India and was generally admired across the world for his idealism and statesmanship. The honorific \"Pandit\", meaning \"Wise One\", has been applied before his name since his lifetime. Nehru's ideals and policies continue shaping the Congress Party's manifesto and core political philosophy. His birthday, 14 November is celebrated in India as \"Bal Divas\" (\"Children's Day\") in recognition of his lifelong passion and work for the welfare, education and development of children and young people. Children across India remember him as \"Chacha Nehru\" (\"Uncle Nehru\"). Nehru remains a popular symbol of the Congress Party which frequently celebrates his memory. People often emulate his style of clothing, especially the Gandhi cap and the Nehru jacket. Nehru's preference for the sherwani ensured it continues to be considered formal wear in North India today.\nMany public institutions and memorials across India are dedicated to Nehru's memory. The Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi is among the most prestigious universities in India. The Jawaharlal Nehru Port near the city of Mumbai is a modern port and dock designed to handle a huge cargo and traffic load. Nehru's residence in Delhi is preserved as the Teen Murti House now has the Nehru Memorial Museum &amp; Library, and one of five Nehru Planetariums that were set in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Allahabad and Pune. The complex also houses the offices of the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund, established in 1964 under the chairmanship of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, then president of India. The foundation also gives away the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fellowship, established in 1968. The Nehru family homes at Anand Bhavan and Swaraj Bhavan are also preserved to commemorate Nehru and his family's legacy. In 1997, Nehru was voted as the greatest Indian since independence in \"India Today\"' poll. In 2012, he ranked number four in \"Outlook\"'s poll of The Greatest Indian. In 2010, he ranked among Britannica's \"The 100 Most Influential World Leaders of All Time\".\nIn popular culture.\nThere have been many documentaries about Nehru's life, and he has been portrayed in fictionalised films. The canonical performance is probably that of Roshan Seth, who played him three times: in Richard Attenborough's 1982 film \"Gandhi\", Shyam Benegal's 1988 television series \"Bharat Ek Khoj\", based on Nehru's \"The Discovery of India\", and in a 2007 TV film entitled \"The Last Days of the Raj\". Benegal directed the 1984 documentary film, \"Nehru\", covering his political career. Indian film director Kiran Kumar made a film about Nehru titled \"Nehru: The Jewel of India\" in 1990 starring Partap Sharma in the titular role. In Ketan Mehta's film \"Sardar\", Benjamin Gilani portrayed Nehru. \"Naunihal\" (lit.\u2009'Young man'), a 1967 Indian Hindi-language drama film by Raj Marbros, follows Raju, an orphan, who believes that Jawaharlal Nehru is his relative and sets out to meet him.\nSimilarly, in the 1957 film \"Ab Dilli Dur Nahin\" (lit.\u2009'Now Delhi is not far away') by Amar Kumar, Rattan, a young boy, travels to Delhi and seeks to avert the death sentence of his wrongly convicted father by asking Prime Minister Nehru for help. Another 1957 English language short documentary \"Our Prime Minister\" was produced, compiled and directed by Ezra Mir, who also directed \"Three Weeks in the Life of Prime Minister Nehru\" in 1962. Girish Karnad's historical play, \"Tughlaq\" (1962) is an allegory about the Nehruvian era. It was staged by Ebrahim Alkazi with the National School of Drama Repertory at Purana Qila, Delhi in the 1970s and later at the Festival of India, London in 1982.\nWritings.\nNehru was a prolific writer in English who wrote \"The Discovery of India\", \"Glimpses of World History\", \"An Autobiography\" (released in the United States as \"Toward Freedom\",) and \"Letters from a Father to His Daughter\", all written in jail. \"Letters\" comprised thirty letters written to his daughter Indira Priyadarshani Nehru (later Gandhi) who was then ten years old and studying at a boarding school in Mussoorie. It attempted to instruct her about natural history and world civilisations. Nehru, as PM, wrote biweekly letters to Chief Ministers of the states from 1947 to 1964.\nNehru's books have been widely read. \"An Autobiography\", in particular, has been critically acclaimed. John Gunther, writing in \"Inside Asia\", contrasted it with Gandhi's autobiography: The Mahatma's placid story compares to Nehru's as a cornflower to an orchid, a rhyming couplet to a sonnet by MacLeish or Auden, a water pistol to a machine gun. Nehru's autobiography is subtle, complex, discriminating, infinitely cultivated, steeped in doubt, suffused with intellectual passion. Lord Halifax once said that no one could understand India without reading it; it is a kind of 'Education of Henry Adams,' written in superlative prose\u2014hardly a dozen men alive write English as well as Nehru ...\nMichael Brecher, who considered Nehru to be an intellectual for whom ideas were important aspects of Indian nationalism, wrote in \"Political Leadership and Charisma: Nehru, Ben-Gurion, and Other 20th-Century Political Leaders\": Nehru's books were not scholarly, nor were they intended to be. He was not a trained historian, but his feel for the flow of events and his capacity to weave together a wide range of knowledge in a meaningful pattern give to his books qualities of a high order. In these works, he also revealed a sensitive literary style. ... \"Glimpses of World History\" is the most illuminating on Nehru as an intellectual. The first of the trilogy, \"Glimpses\", was a series of thinly connected sketches of the story of mankind in the form of letters to his teenage daughter, Indira, later prime minister of India. ... Despite its polemical character in many sections and its shortcomings as an impartial history, \"Glimpses\" is a work of great artistic value, a worthy precursor of his noble and magnanimous \"Autobiography\".\nMichael Crocker thought \"An Autobiography\" would have given Nehru literary fame had the political fame eluded him:It is to his years in prison that we owe his three main books, ... Nehru's writings illustrate a cerebral life, and a power of self-discipline, altogether out of the ordinary. Words by the million bubbled up out of his fullness of mind and spirit. Had he never been prime minister of India he would have been famous as the author of the \"Autobiography\" and the autobiographical parts of \"The Discovery of India\". \"An Autobiography\", at least with some excisions here and there, is likely to be read for generations. ... There are, for instance, the characteristic touches of truism and anticlimax, strange in a man who could both think and, at his best, write so well ...\nNehru's speech \"Tryst with Destiny\" was rated by the British newspaper \"The Guardian\" to be among the great speeches of the 20th century. Ian Jack wrote in his introduction to the speech: Dressed in a golden silk jacket with a red rose in the buttonhole, Nehru rose to speak. His sentences were finely made and memorable\u2014Nehru was a good writer; his Discovery of India stands well above the level reached by most politician-writers. ... The nobility of Nehru's words\u2014their sheer sweep\u2014provided the new India with a lodestone that was ambitious and humane. Post-colonialism began here as well as Indian democracy, which has since outlived many expectations of its death.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}

One of the most iconic and successful rock performers of her era, she was noted for her powerful mezzo-soprano vocals and her \"electric\" stage presence.\nIn 1967, Joplin rose to prominence following an appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival, where she was the lead singer of the then little-known San Francisco psychedelic rock band Big Brother and the Holding Company. After releasing two albums with the band, she left Big Brother to continue as a solo artist with her own backing groups, first the Kozmic Blues Band and then the Full Tilt Boogie Band. She performed at the 1969 Woodstock Festival and on the \"Festival Express\" train tour. Five singles by Joplin reached the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, including a cover of the Kris Kristofferson song \"Me and Bobby McGee\", which posthumously reached number one in March 1971. Her most popular songs include her cover versions of \"Piece of My Heart\", \"Cry Baby\", \"Down on Me\", \"Ball and Chain\", and \"Summertime\", as well as her original song \"Mercedes Benz\", which was her final recording.\nJoplin died of a heroin overdose in 1970, at the age of 27, after releasing three albums (two with Big Brother and the Holding Company and one solo album). A second solo album, \"Pearl\", was released in January 1971, three months after her death. It reached number one on the \"Billboard\" 200. She was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Joplin number 28 on its 2008 list of the \"200 Greatest Singers of All Time\", dropping to number 78 in the 2023 list. As of 2013, she remains one of the top-selling vocalists in the United States, with Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certifications of 18.5\u00a0million albums sold.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life.\nJanis Lyn Joplin was born in Port Arthur, Texas, on (1943--) 19, 1943, to Dorothy Bonita East (1913\u20131998), a registrar at a business college, and her husband, Seth Ward Joplin (1910\u20131987), an engineer at Texaco. She had two younger siblings, Laura and Michael. The family attended First Christian Church of Port Arthur, a church belonging to the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) denomination.\nHer parents felt that Janis needed more attention than their other children. As a teenager, Joplin befriended a group of outcasts, one of whom had albums by blues artists Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, and Lead Belly, which Joplin later credited with influencing her decision to become a singer. She began singing blues and folk music with friends at Thomas Jefferson High School. In high school, she was a classmate of Pro Football Hall of Fame coach Jimmy Johnson. Joplin stated that she was ostracized and bullied in high school. As a teen, she became overweight and suffered from acne, leaving her with deep scars that required dermabrasion. Other kids at high school would routinely taunt her and call her names like \"pig\", \"freak\", \"n-word lover\", or \"creep\". She said, \"I was a misfit. I read, I painted, I thought. I didn't hate black people.\"\nJoplin graduated from high school in 1960 and attended Lamar State College of Technology in Beaumont, Texas, during the summer and later the University of Texas at Austin (UT), although she did not complete her college studies. The campus newspaper, \"The Daily Texan\", ran a profile of her in the issue dated July 27, 1962, headlined \"She Dares to Be Different.\" The article began, \"She goes barefooted when she feels like it, wears Levi's to class because they're more comfortable, and carries her Autoharp with her everywhere she goes so that in case she gets the urge to break into song, it will be handy. Her name is Janis Joplin.\" While at UT she performed with a folk trio called the Waller Creek Boys (Powell St. John and Lanny Wiggins), showcasing her strong mezzo-soprano vocals, and frequently socialized with the staff of the campus humor magazine \"The Texas Ranger\". According to Freak Brothers cartoonist Gilbert Shelton, who befriended her, she used to sell \"The Texas Ranger\", which contained some of Shelton's early comic books, on the campus.\nCareer.\n1962\u20131965: Early recordings.\nJoplin cultivated a rebellious manner and styled herself partly after her female blues heroines and partly after the Beat poets. Her first song, \"What Good Can Drinkin' Do\", was recorded on tape in December 1962 at the home of a fellow University of Texas student. She left Texas in January 1963, \"Just to get away,\" she said, \"because my head was in a much different place\", hitchhiking with her friend Chet Helms to North Beach, San Francisco. Still in San Francisco in 1964, Joplin and future Jefferson Airplane guitarist Jorma Kaukonen recorded a number of blues standards, which incidentally featured Kaukonen's wife Margareta using a typewriter in the background. This session included seven tracks: \"Typewriter Talk\", \"Trouble in Mind\", \"Kansas City Blues\", \"Hesitation Blues\", \"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\", \"Daddy, Daddy, Daddy\", and \"Long Black Train Blues\", and was released long after Joplin's death as the bootleg album \"The Typewriter Tape\".\nIn 1963, Joplin was arrested in San Francisco for shoplifting. During the two years that followed, her drug use increased and she acquired a reputation as a \"speed freak\" and occasional heroin user. She also used other psychoactive drugs and was a heavy drinker throughout her career; her favorite alcoholic beverage was Southern Comfort. In May 1965, Joplin's friends in San Francisco, noticing the detrimental effects on her from regularly injecting methamphetamine\u2014she was described as \"skeletal\" and \"emaciated\"\u2014 persuaded her to return to Port Arthur. During that month, her friends threw her a bus-fare party so she could return to her parents in Texas. Five years later, Joplin told \"Rolling Stone\" magazine writer David Dalton the following about her first stint in San Francisco: \"I didn't have many friends and I didn't like the ones I had.\"\nBack in Port Arthur in the spring of 1965, after Joplin's parents noticed her weight of , she changed her lifestyle. She avoided drugs and alcohol, adopted a beehive hairdo, and enrolled as an anthropology major at Lamar University in nearby Beaumont, Texas. Her sister Laura said in a 2016 interview that social work was her major during her year at Lamar. During her time at Lamar University, she commuted to Austin to sing solo, accompanying herself on acoustic guitar. One of her performances was at a benefit by local musicians for Texas bluesman Mance Lipscomb, who was suffering with ill health. Joplin became engaged to Peter de Blanc in the fall of 1965. She had begun a relationship with him toward the end of her first stint in San Francisco. Now living in New York where he worked with IBM computers, he visited her to ask her father for her hand in marriage. Joplin and her mother began planning the wedding. De Blanc, who traveled frequently, ended the engagement soon afterward.\nIn 1965 and 1966, Joplin commuted from her family's Port Arthur home to Beaumont, Texas, where she had regular sessions with a psychiatric social worker named Bernard Giarritano at a counseling agency that was funded by the United Fund (now the United Way). Interviewed by biographer Myra Friedman after his client's death, Giarritano said Joplin had been baffled by how she could pursue a professional career as a singer without relapsing into drugs, and her drug-related memories from immediately prior to returning to Port Arthur continued to frighten her. Joplin sometimes brought an acoustic guitar with her to her sessions with Giarritano, and people in other offices within the building could hear her singing. Giarritano tried to reassure her that she did not have to use narcotics to succeed in the music business. She also said that if she were to avoid singing professionally, she would have to become a keypunch operator, as she had done a few years earlier, or a secretary, and then a wife and mother, and she would have to become similar to all the other women in Port Arthur. Approximately a year before Joplin joined Big Brother and the Holding Company, she recorded seven studio tracks with her acoustic guitar. Among the songs she recorded were her original composition of \"Turtle Blues\" and an alternate version of \"Cod'ine\" by Buffy Sainte-Marie. These tracks were later released as an album in 1995, titled \"This is Janis Joplin 1965\".\n1966\u20131969: Big Brother and the Holding Company.\nIn 1966, Joplin's bluesy vocal style attracted the attention of the San Francisco-based psychedelic rock band Big Brother and the Holding Company, which had gained some renown among the nascent hippie community in Haight-Ashbury. She was recruited to join the group by Chet Helms, a promoter who was managing Big Brother and with whom she had hitchhiked from Texas to San Francisco a few years earlier. Helms sent his friend Travis Rivers to find her in Austin, Texas, where she had been performing with her acoustic guitar, and to accompany her to San Francisco. At that time, she gave her parents the impression Austin was her final destination and it was the location of the rock band she was joining. Joplin joined Big Brother on June 4, 1966. Her first public performance with them was at the Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco. Soon after that, her parents received a letter from her, and that was how they learned she was in San Francisco, not Austin.\nIn June 1966, Joplin was still strict about drug use and when she shared an apartment with Travis Rivers upon their arrival in San Francisco, she made him promise that using needles would not be allowed there. When bandmate Dave Getz accompanied her from a rehearsal to her home, Rivers was not there, but \"two or three\", according to Getz' recollection 25 years later, guests whom Rivers had invited were in the process of injecting drugs. \"One of them was about to tie off,\" recalled Getz. \"\"Janis went nuts!\" I had never seen anybody explode like that. She was screaming and crying and Travis walked in. She screamed at him: 'We had a pact! You promised me! There wouldn't be any of that in front of me!' I was over my head and I tried to calm her down. I said, 'They're just doing mescaline,' because that's what I thought it was. She said, 'You don't understand! I can't see that! I just can't stand to see that!'\"\nA San Francisco concert from that summer (1966) was recorded and released on the 1984 album \"Cheaper Thrills\". Joplin had a short relationship and longer friendship with Grateful Dead founding member Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan. The band went to Chicago for a four-week engagement in August 1966, then found itself stranded after the promoter ran out of money when its concerts did not attract the expected audience levels, and he was unable to pay them. In the unfortunate circumstances the band signed with Bob Shad's record label Mainstream Records; recordings for the label took place in Chicago in September, but these were not satisfactory, and the band returned to San Francisco, continuing to perform live, including at the Love Pageant Rally. The band recorded two tracks, \"Blindman\" and \"All Is Loneliness\", in Los Angeles, and these were released by Mainstream as a single that did not sell well. After playing at a happening in Stanford in early December 1966, the band traveled back to Los Angeles to record ten tracks between December 12 and 14, 1966, produced by Bob Shad, which appeared on the band's debut album in August 1967. In late 1966, Big Brother switched managers from Chet Helms to Julius Karpen. Janis Joplin and Big Brother performed there along with the Hare Krishna founder Bhaktivedanta Swami, Allen Ginsberg, Moby Grape, and the Grateful Dead, donating proceeds to the Krishna temple. In early 1967, Joplin met Country Joe McDonald of the group Country Joe and the Fish. The pair lived together as a couple for a few months in her Lyon Street apartment. A driver's license, issued to Joplin in 1967, shows her residence as 122 Lyon Street No. 3, in San Francisco. Joplin and Big Brother played at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, as well as in Seattle, Washington; Vancouver, British Columbia; the Psychedelic Supermarket in Boston, Massachusetts; and the Golden Bear Club in Huntington Beach, California.\nThe band's debut studio album, \"Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company\", was released by Mainstream Records in August 1967, shortly after the group's breakthrough appearance in June at the Monterey Pop Festival. Two tracks, \"Coo Coo\" and \"The Last Time\", were released separately as singles, while the tracks from the previous single, \"Blindman\" and \"All Is Loneliness\", were added to the remaining eight tracks. When Columbia Records took over the band's contract and re-released the album, they included \"Coo Coo\" and \"The Last Time\", and put \"featuring Janis Joplin\" on the cover. The debut album spawned four minor hits sung by Joplin including \"Down on Me\", a traditional song arranged by Joplin, \"Bye Bye Baby\", \"Call On Me\" and \"Coo Coo\". All but one of the tracks of their next album \"Cheap Thrills\" were recorded in the studio with only \"Ball and Chain\" actually recorded in front of a paying audience. The album had a raw quality, including the sound of a drinking glass breaking and the broken shards being swept away during the song \"Turtle Blues\". \"Cheap Thrills\" produced popular hits with \"Piece of My Heart\" and \"Summertime\". Together with the premiere of the documentary film \"Monterey Pop\" at New York's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts on December 26, 1968, the album launched Joplin as a star. \"Cheap Thrills\" reached number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart eight weeks after its release, and was number one for eight (nonconsecutive) weeks.\n\"Kosmic Blues\" and Woodstock (1969\u20131970).\nAfter splitting from Big Brother and the Holding Company, Joplin formed a new backup group, the Kozmic Blues Band, composed of session musicians like keyboardist Stephen Ryder and saxophonist Cornelius \"Snooky\" Flowers, as well as former Big Brother and the Holding Company guitarist Sam Andrew and future Full Tilt Boogie Band bassist Brad Campbell. The band was influenced by the Stax-Volt rhythm and blues (R&amp;B) and soul bands of the 1960s, as exemplified by Otis Redding and the Bar-Kays. By early 1969, Joplin was allegedly shooting at least $200 worth of heroin per day () although efforts were made to keep her clean during the recording of \"I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!\" Gabriel Mekler, who produced the album, kept her away from drugs and her drug-using friends during the record's production. Joplin's appearances with the Kozmic Blues Band in Europe were released in theaters, in multiple documentaries. \"Janis\", which was reviewed by \"The Washington Post\" on March 21, 1975, shows Joplin arriving in Frankfurt by plane. The film \"Janis\" includes interviews with Joplin in Stockholm and from her visit to London, for her gig at Royal Albert Hall. John Byrne Cooke, road manager for Joplin and the Kozmic Blues Band, wrote a book about her ongoing use of narcotics, particularly when she was outside the United States. On the episode of \"The Dick Cavett Show\" that was telecast in the United States on the night of July 18, 1969, Joplin and her band performed \"Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)\" as well as \"To Love Somebody\".\nJoplin performed at Woodstock starting at approximately 2:00\u00a0a.m., on Sunday, August 17, 1969. Joplin had informed her band that they would be performing at the concert as if it were just another gig. Joplin was flown by helicopter with the pregnant Joan Baez and Baez's mother to the festival site. During the helicopter ride, she saw the enormous crowd and instantly became extremely nervous and giddy, as Baez recalled. Initially, Joplin was eager to get on the stage and perform, but was repeatedly delayed as bands were contractually obliged to perform ahead of Joplin. Faced with a ten-hour wait after arriving at the backstage area, Joplin spent some of that time shooting heroin and drinking alcohol with her friend and sometimes lover Peggy Caserta in a tent. Joplin pulled through, and engaged frequently with the crowd, asking them if they had everything they needed and if they were staying stoned. The audience cheered for an encore, to which Joplin replied and sang \"Ball and Chain\". Pete Townshend, who performed with the Who later in the same morning after Joplin finished, witnessed her performance and said in his 2012 memoir, \"She had been amazing at Monterey, but tonight she wasn't at her best, due, probably, to the long delay, and probably, too, to the amount of booze and heroin she'd consumed while she waited. But even Janis on an off-night was incredible.\" Janis remained at Woodstock for the remainder of the festival. Starting at approximately 3:00\u00a0a.m. on Monday, August 18, Joplin was among many Woodstock performers who stood in a circle behind Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash during their performance. This information was published by David Crosby in 1988. Later in the morning of August 18, Joplin and Joan Baez sat in Joe Cocker's van and witnessed Hendrix's close-of-show performance, according to Baez's memoir \"And a Voice to Sing With\" (1989).\nJoplin was unhappy with her performance, however, and her singing was not included, by her own insistence, in the 1970 documentary film or the soundtrack for \"\" (although the 25th anniversary director's cut of \"Woodstock\" includes her performance of \"Work Me, Lord\"). Joplin was arrested for using \"vulgar and indecent language\" on November 16, 1969, at the Curtis Hixon Hall in Tampa, Florida after yelling \"Don't fuck with those people!\" toward police officers doing crowd control, for which she was found guilty and fined $200 plus court costs. In addition to Woodstock and her Tampa concert, in 1969 Joplin had problems at Madison Square Garden. Her publicist-turned-biographer Myra Friedman said, after Joplin's death, she had witnessed a duet Joplin sang with Tina Turner during the opening act (Ike and Tina Turner) for a Rolling Stones concert at the Garden on Thanksgiving Day. Friedman said Joplin was \"so drunk, so stoned, so out of control, that she could have been an institutionalized psychotic rent by mania.\" An audio recording of the duet exists online. During another Garden concert where she had solo billing on December 19, some observers believed Joplin tried to incite the audience to riot. For part of this concert she was joined onstage by Johnny Winter and Paul Butterfield. Joplin told rock journalist David Dalton that Garden audiences watched and listened to \"every note [she sang] with 'Is she gonna make it?' in their eyes.\"\nReleased in September 1969, the \"Kozmic Blues\" album was certified gold later that year but did not match the success of \"Cheap Thrills\". Reviews of the new group were mixed. Some music critics, including Ralph J. Gleason of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", were negative. Gleason wrote that the new band was a \"drag\" and Joplin should \"scrap\" her new band and \"go right back to being a member of Big Brother ... (if they'll have her).\" Other reviewers, such as reporter Carl Bernstein of \"The Washington Post\", devoted entire articles to celebrating the singer's magic. Bernstein's review said that Joplin \"has finally assembled a group of first-rate musicians with whom she is totally at ease and whose abilities complement the incredible range of her voice.\" Columbia Records released \"Kozmic Blues\" as a single, which peaked at number 41 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and a live rendition of \"Raise Your Hand\" was released in Germany and became a top ten hit there. Containing other hits like \"Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)\", \"To Love Somebody\", and \"Little Girl Blue\", \"I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!\" reached number five on the \"Billboard\" 200 soon after its release.\nJanuary\u2013July 1970.\nAt the time of the June 1970 interview with Dalton, she had already performed in the Bay Area for what turned out to be the last time. Sam Andrew, the lead guitarist who had left Big Brother with Joplin in December 1968 to form her back-up band, quit in late summer 1969 and returned to Big Brother. At the end of the year, the Kozmic Blues Band broke up. Their final gig with Joplin was the one at Madison Square Garden with Winter and Butterfield. In February 1970, Joplin traveled to Brazil, where she stopped her drug and alcohol use. She was accompanied on vacation there by her friend Linda Gravenites (wife of songwriter Nick Gravenites), who had designed Janis's stage costumes from 1967 to 1969. In Brazil, Joplin was romanced by a fellow American tourist named David (George) Niehaus, who was traveling around the world. Niehaus and Joplin were photographed by the press at Rio Carnival in Rio de Janeiro. Gravenites also took color photographs of the two during their Brazilian vacation. According to Joplin biographer Ellis Amburn, in Gravenites' snapshots they \"look like a carefree, happy, healthy young couple having a tremendously good time.\"\n\"Rolling Stone\" magazine interviewed Joplin during an international phone call, quoting her: \"I'm going into the jungle with a big bear of a beatnik named David Niehaus. I finally remembered I don't have to be on stage twelve months a year. I've decided to go and dig some other jungles for a couple of weeks.\" Amburn added in 1992, \"Janis was trying to kick heroin in Brazil, and one of the nicest things about David was that he wasn't into drugs.\" When Joplin returned to the U.S., she began using heroin again. Her relationship with Niehaus soon ended because he witnessed her shooting drugs at her new home in Larkspur, California. The relationship was also complicated by her ongoing romantic relationship with Peggy Caserta, who also was an intravenous addict, and Joplin's refusal to take some time off and travel the world with him. Prior to beginning a summer tour with a newly formed band, she performed in final appearances with Big Brother in a reunion at the Fillmore West, in San Francisco, on April 4, 1970. Recordings from this concert were included on \"Joplin in Concert\" released posthumously in 1972. She again appeared with Big Brother on April 12 at Winterland, where she and Big Brother were reported to be in excellent form.\nAround this time, she formed her new band, known for a short time as Main Squeeze, then renamed the Full Tilt Boogie Band. The band comprised mostly young Canadian musicians previously associated with Ronnie Hawkins and featured an organ, but no horn section. Joplin took a more active role in putting together the Full Tilt Boogie band than she had with her prior group. She was quoted as saying, \"It's \"my\" band. Finally it's \"my\" band!\" In May 1970, after performing under the name Main Squeeze at a Hells Angels event, the renamed Full Tilt Boogie Band began a nationwide tour. Joplin became very happy with her new group, which eventually received mostly positive feedback from both her fans and the critics. She performed with the band, billed as Main Squeeze, at a party for the Hells Angels at a venue in San Rafael, California on May 21, 1970, according to a web site maintained by Big Brother guitarist Sam Andrew. Andrew's web site quotes him as saying, \"This will be the first time that Janis' old band and her new band will be at the same venue, so everyone is a little on edge.\"\nAccording to Joplin's biographer Ellis Amburn, Big Brother with its lead singer Nick Gravenites was the opening act at the party that was attended by 2,300 people. The Hells Angels, who had known Joplin since 1966, paid her a fee of $240 to perform. Gravenites and Sam Andrew (who had resumed playing guitar with Big Brother) differed in their opinions of her performance and how substance abuse affected it. Gravenites described her singing as \"stupendous\", according to Amburn. Amburn quoted Andrew twenty years later: \"She was visibly deteriorating and she looked bloated. She was like a parody of what she was at her best. I put it down to her drinking too much and I felt a tinge of fear for her well-being. Her singing was real flabby, no edge at all.\" Shortly thereafter, Joplin began wearing multi-colored feather boas in her hair. (She had not worn them at the May 21 Hells Angels party/&lt;wbr&gt;concert in San Rafael). By the time she began touring with Full Tilt Boogie, Joplin told people she was drug-free, but her drinking increased.\n\"Pearl\" (July\u2013October 1970).\nFrom June 28 to July 4, 1970, during the Festival Express tour, Joplin and Full Tilt Boogie performed alongside Buddy Guy, The Band, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Ten Years After, the Grateful Dead, Delaney &amp; Bonnie, Eric Andersen, and Ian &amp; Sylvia. They played concerts in Toronto, Winnipeg, and Calgary. Footage of her performance of \"Tell Mama\" in Calgary became an MTV video in the early 1980s. Among Joplin's last public appearances were two broadcasts of \"The Dick Cavett Show\". In her June 25, 1970, appearance, she announced that she would attend her ten-year high school class reunion. When asked if she had been popular in school, she admitted that when in high school, her schoolmates \"laughed me out of class, out of town and out of the state\". On July 11, 1970, Full Tilt Boogie and Big Brother and the Holding Company both performed at the same concert in the San Diego Sports Arena, which was decades later renamed the Valley View Casino Center. Joplin sang with Full Tilt Boogie and appeared briefly onstage with Big Brother without singing, according to a July 13 review of the concert in the \"San Diego Union\". On August 7, 1970, a tombstone\u2014jointly paid for by Joplin and Juanita Green, a registered nurse who as a child had done housework for Bessie Smith\u2014was erected at Smith's previously unmarked grave. Joplin had frequently cited Bessie Smith as a musical influence. The lead paragraph of an Associated Press story said Joplin and Green had \"shared the cost of a stone for the 'Empress of the Blues,'\" but, according to publicist/biographer Myra Friedman, Joplin and Green never met. During this time, she first performed \"Mercedes Benz\", a song partially inspired by a Michael McClure poem, that she had composed with fellow musician and friend Bob Neuwirth a very short time earlier which would be released on \"Pearl\". According to Myra Friedman's account, Joplin performed two shows at the Capitol Theatre, the first of which was attended by actors Geraldine Page and her husband Rip Torn. Between the shows, at a \"gin mill\" [Friedman's words] close to this concert venue, Joplin and Neuwirth penned the lyrics to the song and she performed it at the second show, according to Friedman.\nNeuwirth was quoted by \"The Wall Street Journal\" in 2015: \"Around 7 p.m., after the Capitol sound check, we had a couple of hours to kill before [acts that opened for Joplin] Seatrain and Runt finished their sets. So the four of us [Joplin, Neuwirth, Geraldine Page, Rip Torn] walked to a bar about three minutes away called Vahsen's [at 30 Broad Street in Port Chester].\" While in Vahsen's, \"Janis came up with words for the first verse. I was in charge of writing them down on bar napkins with a ballpoint pen. She came up with the second verse [for \"Mercedes Benz\"], too, about a color TV. I suggested words here and there, and came up with the third verse\u2014about asking the Lord to buy us a night on the town and another round.\" Joplin's last public performance with the Full Tilt Boogie Band took place on August 12, 1970, at the Harvard Stadium in Boston. \"The Harvard Crimson\" gave the performance a positive, front-page review, despite the fact that Full Tilt Boogie had performed with makeshift amplifiers after their regular sound equipment was stolen in Boston. Joplin attended her high school reunion on August 14, accompanied by Neuwirth, road manager John Byrne Cooke, and sister Laura, but it was reportedly an unhappy experience for her. Joplin denigrated Port Arthur and the classmates who had humiliated her a decade earlier.\nJoplin checked into the Landmark Motor Hotel in Hollywood on August 24, 1970, near Sunset Sound Recorders, where she began rehearsing and recording her album. During the sessions, Joplin continued a relationship with Seth Morgan, a 21-year-old UC Berkeley student, cocaine dealer, and future novelist who had visited her new home in Larkspur in July and August. She and Morgan were engaged to be married in early September, although he visited Sunset Sound Recorders for just eight of Joplin's many rehearsals and sessions. During late August, September, and early October 1970, Joplin and her band rehearsed and recorded a new album in Los Angeles with producer Paul A. Rothchild, best known for his lengthy relationship with The Doors. Although Joplin died before all the tracks were fully completed, there was enough usable material to compile an LP. The posthumous \"Pearl\" (1971) became the biggest-selling album of her career and featured her biggest hit single, a cover of Kris Kristofferson and Fred Foster's \"Me and Bobby McGee\" (Kristofferson had previously been one of Joplin's lovers, though the song was taught to her by Neuwirth). The opening track, \"Move Over\", was written by Joplin, reflecting the way that she felt men treated women in relationships.\nPeggy Caserta claimed in her book, \"Going Down With Janis\" (1973), that she and Joplin had decided mutually in April 1970 to stay away from each other to avoid enabling each other's drug use. Caserta, a former Delta Air Lines flight attendant and owner of \"Mnasidika\",&lt;ref name=\"levistrauss/haight-st\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; one of the first clothing boutiques in the Haight Ashbury, said in the book that by September 1970, she was smuggling cannabis throughout California and had checked into the Landmark Motor Hotel because it attracted drug users. During Joplin's stay at the Landmark, she learned of Caserta's presence at the Landmark from a heroin dealer who made deliveries there. Joplin begged Caserta for heroin, and when Caserta refused to provide it, Joplin reportedly admonished her by saying, \"Don't think if you can get it, I can't get it.\" Joplin's publicist Myra Friedman was unaware during Joplin's lifetime that this had happened. Later, while Friedman was working on her book \"Buried Alive\", she determined that the time frame of the Joplin\u2013Caserta encounter was one week before Jimi Hendrix's death. Within a few days, Joplin became a regular customer of the same heroin dealer who had been supplying Caserta.\nSeptember\u2013October 1970.\nJoplin's manager Albert Grossman and his assistant/publicist Friedman had staged an intervention with Joplin the previous winter while Joplin was in New York. Grossman and Friedman knew during Joplin's lifetime that her friend Caserta, whom Friedman had met during the New York sessions for \"Cheap Thrills\" and on later occasions, used heroin. In September 1970, Friedman assumed Caserta had been out of Joplin's life for a while. Neither Friedman nor Grossman visited California. When Joplin was not at Sunset Sound Recorders, she liked to drive her Porsche over the speed limit \"on the winding part of Sunset Blvd.\", according to a statement made by her attorney Robert Gordon in 1995 at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony. Friedman wrote that the only Full Tilt Boogie member who rode as her passenger, Ken Pearson, often hesitated to join her, though he did on the night she died. He was not interested in using hard drugs. On September 26, 1970, Joplin recorded vocals for \"Half Moon\" and \"Cry Baby\". The session ended with Joplin, organist Ken Pearson, and drummer Clark Pierson making a special one-minute recording as a birthday gift to John Lennon with the Dale Evans composition \"Happy Trails\" as part of the greeting.\nOn October 1, 1970, Joplin completed her last recording, \"Mercedes Benz\", which was recorded in a single take. On Saturday, October 3, Joplin visited Sunset Sound Recorders to listen to the instrumental track for Nick Gravenites's song \"Buried Alive in the Blues\", which the band had recorded earlier that day. She and Paul Rothchild agreed she would record the vocal the following day. Sometime on Saturday, she learned that her boyfriend Seth Morgan had met other women at a Marin County, California, restaurant, and invited them to her home. People at Sunset Sound Recorders overheard Joplin expressing anger about Morgan's actions, as well as joy about the progress of the sessions. Joplin and Ken Pearson later left the studio together and she drove him in her Porsche to the West Hollywood venue called Barney's Beanery where they met Bennett Glotzer, a business partner of Joplin's manager Albert Grossman. After midnight, she drove Ken Pearson and a male fan from Barney's Beanery to the Landmark Motor Hotel. During the ride, the fan repeatedly asked her about her singing style, and \"she mostly ignored him,\" as Pearson told Myra Friedman. After arriving at the Landmark, where she and Pearson were staying in separate rooms, they prepared to part in the lobby of the Landmark, when she expressed a fear, possibly in jest, that he and the other Full Tilt Boogie musicians might decide to stop making music with her. Then they separated and went to their rooms.\nDeath.\nOn Sunday evening, October 4, 1970, Joplin was found dead on the floor of her room at the Landmark Motor Hotel by her road manager and close friend John Byrne Cooke. Alcohol was present in the room. Newspapers reported that no other drugs or paraphernalia were present. According to a 1983 book authored by Joseph DiMona and Los Angeles County coroner Thomas Noguchi, evidence of narcotics was removed from the scene by a friend of Joplin and later put back after the person realized that an autopsy was going to reveal that narcotics were in her system. The book adds that prior to Joplin's death, Noguchi had investigated other fatal drug overdoses in Los Angeles where friends believed they were doing favors for decedents by removing evidence of narcotics, but then \"thought things over\" and returned to put back the evidence. Noguchi performed an autopsy on Joplin and determined the cause of death to be a heroin overdose, possibly compounded by alcohol.\nJohn Byrne Cooke believed Joplin had obtained heroin much more potent than what she and other L.A. heroin users had received on previous occasions, as was indicated by overdoses of several of her dealer's other customers during the same weekend. Her death was ruled accidental.\nBoth Peggy Caserta, Joplin's close friend, and Seth Morgan, Joplin's fianc\u00e9, failed to meet Joplin on Oct. 2, the Friday immediately before her death; Joplin had been expecting both of them to keep her company that night. According to Caserta, Joplin was saddened neither of her friends came to the Landmark as promised. During the 24 hours Joplin lived after this disappointment, Caserta did not call to explain why she failed to show up. Caserta admitted to waiting until late Saturday night to dial the Landmark Motel switchboard, only to learn that Joplin had instructed the desk clerk not to accept any incoming calls for her after midnight. Morgan did speak to Joplin via telephone within the 24 hours before her death, but little is known about that call. She used a phone at Sunset Sound Recorders where her colleagues (\"there were perhaps twenty to twenty-five people present,\" wrote biographer Myra Friedman) noticed that whatever Morgan said to her made her very angry.\nPeggy Caserta has insisted Joplin's death was not an accidental overdose, but rather a result of a head gash suffered after the \"hourglass heel\" of her slingback sandal caught in the shag carpet, causing her to lose her balance. Caserta did concede, however, that drugs and/or alcohol may have played a role in hastening Joplin's death that night. Joplin was cremated at Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park and Mortuary in Los Angeles, and her ashes were scattered from a plane into the Pacific Ocean.\nPersonal life.\nJoplin's significant relationships with men included ones with Peter de Blanc, Country Joe McDonald (who wrote the song \"Janis\" at Joplin's request), David (George) Niehaus, Kris Kristofferson, and Seth Morgan (from July 1970 until her death, at which time they were allegedly engaged). She also had relationships with women. During her first stint in San Francisco in 1963, Joplin met and briefly lived with Jae Whitaker, a woman whom she had met while playing pool at the bar Gino &amp; Carlo in North Beach. Whitaker broke off their relationship because of Joplin's hard drug use and sexual relationships with other people. Whitaker was first identified by name in connection with Joplin in 1999, when Alice Echols' biography \"Scars of Sweet Paradise\" was published.\nJoplin had an on-again-off-again romantic relationship with Peggy Caserta. They first met in November 1966 when Big Brother performed at The Matrix in San Francisco. Caserta was one of 15 people in the audience; at the time, she ran \"Mnasidika\", a clothing boutique in the Haight Ashbury. Approximately a month after the concert, Joplin visited Caserta's boutique and said she could not afford to buy a pair of $5 jeans for sale, asking to make a 50 cent down payment. Caserta was amazed such a talented singer could not afford $5, and gave Joplin a pair for free. Their friendship was platonic for more than a year. Before it became romantic, Caserta was in love with Big Brother guitarist Sam Andrew, and sometime during the first half of 1968 traveled from San Francisco to New York to be with him. He did not want a serious relationship, and Joplin sympathized with Caserta's disappointment. The \"Woodstock\" concert film includes 37 seconds of Joplin and Caserta walking together before they reached the tent where Joplin waited for her turn to perform. By the time the festival took place in August 1969, both were intravenous heroin addicts.\nAccording to Caserta's book \"Going Down With Janis\", which Caserta has since disowned, Joplin introduced her to her boyfriend Seth Morgan in Joplin's room at the Landmark Motor Hotel on September 29, 1970. Caserta \"had seen him around\" in San Francisco but had not met him. At some point, an agreement was made for a threesome to take place the following Friday although Caserta later made alternate plans. Morgan made alternate plans, believing Caserta would be with Joplin that evening. Each one was unaware the other had bowed out. The day after Joplin introduced Caserta to Morgan, Caserta saw Joplin briefly when Caserta accommodated her new Los Angeles friend, 19-year-old Debbie Nuciforo. Nuciforo was an aspiring rock drummer who wanted to meet Joplin and was high on heroin at the time. The meeting of the three women was reportedly brief and unpleasant. Caserta suspected the reason for Joplin's foul mood was that Morgan had abandoned her earlier that day after having spent less than 24 hours with her.\nCaserta did not see nor communicate by phone with Joplin again, although she later claimed she had tried to reach Joplin at the Landmark Motor Hotel and Sunset Sound Recorders. Caserta and Morgan lost touch with each other; each had independently made plans for Friday, October 2. Joplin mentioned her disappointment over both friends bailing out of their \"m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois\" to her drug dealer on Saturday while he was selling her the dose of heroin that killed her, as Caserta later learned from the dealer. Biographer Myra Friedman commented in her original version of \"Buried Alive\" (1973):\nGiven the near-infinite potentials of infancy, it is really impossible to make generalizations about what lies behind sexual practices. This, however, is probable: to become clearly homosexual, to make the choice that one honestly prefers relations with one's own sex, no matter the origins of such preference, requires a certain integration, a stability of psychic development, a tidiness of personality organization. The ridicule and the humiliation that took place at that most delicate period in [Joplin's] early teens, her own inability to surmount the obstacles to regular growth, devastated her a great deal more than most people comprehended. Janis was not heir to an ego so cohesive as to permit her an identity one way or the other. She was, as [the psychiatric social worker she saw regularly in Beaumont, Texas in 1965 and 1966] Mr. [Bernard] Giarritano put it [in an interview with Friedman], \"diffused\" -- spewing, splattering, splaying all over, without a center to hold. That had as much to do with her original use of drugs [before she first met Giarritano] as did the critical component of guilt and its multiplicity of sources above and beyond the contribution made by her relationships with women. Were she so simple as the lesbians wished her to be or so free as her associates imagined!\nKim France reported in her May 2, 1999, \"The New York Times\" article, \"Nothin' Left to Lose\": \"Once she became famous, Joplin cursed like a truck driver, did not believe in wearing undergarments, was rarely seen without her bottle of Southern Comfort and delighted in playing the role of sexual predator.\" On July 11, 1970, Joplin made a revealing statement about her sexuality to her friend Richard Hundgen, the Grateful Dead's San Francisco-based road manager, whom she had known since 1966. When Joplin and Hundgen were offstage during a San Diego gig for both Full Tilt Boogie and Big Brother and the Holding Company, she said the following that he later repeated to Myra Friedman:\nI hear a rumor that somebody in San Francisco is spreading stories that I'm a dyke. You go back there and find out who it is and tell them that Janis says she's gotten it on with a couple of thousand cats in her life and a few hundred chicks and see what they can do with \"that\"!\nJoplin's body art, with a wristlet and a small heart on her left breast by the San Francisco tattoo artist Lyle Tuttle, marked an early moment in the popular culture's acceptance of tattoos as art. Another trademark was her flamboyant hair styles, which often included colored streaks and accessories such as scarves, beads and feathers.\nLegacy.\nLegacy in the 1970s.\nJoplin's death in October 1970 at age 27 stunned her fans and shocked the music world, especially when coupled with the deaths of Canned Heat singer Alan Wilson a month earlier, and rock icon Jimi Hendrix 16 days earlier, both aged 27. All three musicians performed at the two biggest rock festivals of the 1960s: Monterey Pop Festival and Woodstock. (This would later cause some people to attribute significance to the death of musicians at the age of 27, as celebrated in the \"27 Club\".) Music historian Tom Moon wrote that Joplin had \"a devastatingly original voice\", music columnist Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" wrote that Joplin as an artist was \"overpowering and deeply vulnerable\" and author Megan Terry said that Joplin was the female version of Elvis Presley in her ability to captivate an audience. Joplin was noted for her powerful mezzo-soprano vocals with a distinctive rock and roll rasping vocal quality, as well as her \"electric\" stage presence. Her most popular songs include her cover versions of \"Piece of My Heart\", \"Cry Baby\", \"Down on Me\", \"Ball and Chain\", and \"Summertime\", as well as her original song \"Mercedes Benz\", which was her final recording.\nA book about Joplin by her publicist Myra Friedman titled \"Buried Alive: The Biography of Janis Joplin\" (1973) was excerpted in many newspapers. At the same time, Peggy Caserta's memoir, \"Going Down With Janis\" (1973), attracted much attention; its provocative title is a reference to Caserta's claim that she had engaged in oral sex with Joplin while they were high on heroin in September 1970. The description provided by Dan Knapp, Caserta's co-author whom she denounced decades later, repelled many people in 1973 when few books or filmed interviews of Joplin or her loved ones were accessible to the public. Joplin's bandmate Sam Andrew described Caserta as \"halfway between a groupie and a friend\" in an interview with writer Ellis Amburn. Soon after the 1973 publication of \"Going Down With Janis\", Joplin's friends learned that graphic descriptions of sexual acts and intravenous drug use were not the only portions of the book that would haunt them.\nAccording to Kim Chappell, a close friend of Caserta and Joplin, Caserta's book angered the Los Angeles heroin dealer whom she had described in detail in her book, including the make and model of his car. According to Amburn, in 1973, a \"carful of dope dealers\" visited a Los Angeles lesbian bar that Caserta had been frequenting. Chappell, who was in the alley behind the bar, stated: \"I was stabbed because, when Peggy's book came out, her dealer, the same one who'd given Janis her last fix, didn't like it that he was referred to and was out to get Peggy. He couldn't find her, so he went for her lover. When they realized who I was, they felt that my death would also hit Peggy, and so they stabbed me.\" Despite being \"stabbed three times in the chest, puncturing both lungs,\" Chappell eventually recovered.\nAccording to Joplin's biographers, Caserta was among many friends of Joplin who did not become clean and sober until a long time after Joplin's death, while others died from overdoses. Although the wife of Big Brother guitarist James Gurley, who was Joplin's close friend, died from a heroin overdose in 1969, devastating Joplin, Gurley himself did not become clean and sober until 1984. Caserta survived \"a near-fatal OD in December 1995\", wrote Alice Echols. On January 13, 2000, Caserta appeared during a segment about Joplin on \"20/20\". In 2018, Caserta denounced \"Going Down With Janis\" as the pornographic fantasy of Dan Knapp, her co-author, and largely unreliable. During that year, the public had its first access to her own story via a memoir she co-wrote with Maggie Falcon titled \"I Ran into Some Trouble\". It describes a long, friendly relationship with Joplin that only occasionally featured sexuality.\nThe Mamas &amp; the Papas' song \"Pearl\" (1971), from their album \"People Like Us\", was a tribute to Joplin. Leonard Cohen's song \"Chelsea Hotel #2\" (1974) is about Joplin. Lyricist Robert Hunter has commented that Jerry Garcia's \"Birdsong\", from his first solo album, \"Garcia\" (1972), is about Joplin and the end of her suffering through death. Mimi Farina's composition \"In the Quiet Morning\", most famously covered by Joan Baez on her album \"Come from the Shadows\" (1972), was a tribute to Joplin. Another song by Baez, \"Children of the Eighties\", mentioned Joplin. A Serge Gainsbourg-penned French language song by English singer Jane Birkin, \"Ex fan des sixties\" (1978), references Joplin along with other disappeared \"idols\", such as Jimi Hendrix, Brian Jones and Marc Bolan. When Joplin was alive, Country Joe McDonald released a song called \"Janis\" on his band's album \"I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die\" (1967). In her memoir \"Just Kids\", Patti Smith mentions writing a song for Joplin and singing it to her one night at the Chelsea Hotel, where both were living at the time. The song, called \"Lullaby (I Was Working Real Hard)\", was never recorded by Joplin but eventually appeared on Smith's Live At The Bottom Line, a performance from 1975.\nThe film \"The Rose\" (1979) is loosely based on Joplin's life. Originally planned to be titled \"Pearl\"\u2014Joplin's nickname and the title of her last album\u2014the film was fictionalized after her family declined to allow the producers the rights to her story. Bette Midler won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture\u2014Female and earned nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress, the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress, and the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film.\nLegacy in 1980s and 1990s.\nIn 1988, on what would have been Joplin's 45th birthday, the Janis Joplin Memorial, with an original gold, multi-image sculpture of Joplin by Douglas Clark, was dedicated during a ceremony in Port Arthur, Texas. In 1992, the first major biography of Joplin in two decades, \"Love, Janis\", authored by her younger sister Laura Joplin, was published. In an interview, Laura stated that Joplin enjoyed being on the \"Dick Cavett Show\", that Joplin had difficulties with some, but not all, people at Thomas Jefferson High School and that Joplin enthusiastically talked about Woodstock with her parents and siblings during a visit to their Texas home a few weeks after she had performed at the festival.\nIn 1995, Joplin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2005, she received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In November 2009, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum honored her as part of its annual American Music Masters Series; among the artifacts at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum exhibition are Joplin's scarf and necklaces, her psychedelically painted 1965 Porsche 356 Cabriolet and a sheet of LSD blotting paper designed by Robert Crumb, designer of the \"Cheap Thrills\" cover. Also in 2009, Joplin was the honoree at the Rock Hall's American Music Master concert and lecture series. In the late 1990s, the musical play \"Love, Janis\" was created and directed by Randal Myler, with input from Janis' younger sister Laura and Big Brother guitarist Sam Andrew, with an aim to take it to Off-Broadway. Opening in the summer of 2001 and scheduled for only a few weeks of performances, the show won acclaim, played to packed houses and was held over several times.\nLegacy after 2010.\nIn 2013 Washington's Arena Stage featured a production of \"A Night with Janis Joplin\", starring Mary Bridget Davies in which Joplin performs a concert for the audience while telling stories of her past inspirations, including those of Odetta and Aretha Franklin. The production transferred to Broadway, then went on tour in 2016. In August 2024 the Tony-nominated musical opened at London's Peacock Theatre with Davies again in the lead role.\nOn November 4, 2013, Joplin was awarded with the 2,510th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to the music industry. Her star is located at 6752 Hollywood Boulevard, in front of Musicians Institute. On August 8, 2014, the U.S. Postal Service revealed a commemorative stamp honoring Joplin as part of its Music Icons stamp series during a first-day-of-issue ceremony at the Outside Lands Music Festival at Golden Gate Park. Among the memorabilia Joplin left behind is a Gibson Hummingbird guitar. In 2015, the biographical documentary film \"\", directed by Amy J. Berg and narrated by Cat Power, was released. It was a \"New York Times\" Critics' Pick.\nAfter \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Joplin number 46 on its 2004 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" and number 28 on its 2008 list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\", she was then re-ranked in 2023; In 2023, \"Rolling Stone\" then ranked Joplin at number 78 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. Also in 2023, NPR dubbed Joplin as the \"Queen of Rock\" and named her one of the \"50 Great Voices\". As of 2013, she remains one of the top-selling vocalists in the United States, with Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certifications of 18.5\u00a0million albums sold.\nInfluence.\nJoplin had a profound influence on many singers. Pink said about Joplin: \"She was so inspiring by singing blues music when it wasn't culturally acceptable for white women, and she wore her heart on her sleeve. She was so witty and charming and intelligent, but she also battled an ugly-duckling syndrome. I would love to play her in a movie.\" In a tribute performance on her Try This Tour, Pink called Joplin \"a woman who inspired me when everyone else ... didn't!\"\nDiscography.\nJoplin recorded four albums in her four-year career. The first two albums were recorded with and credited to Big Brother and the Holding Company; the later two were recorded with different backing bands and released as solo albums. Posthumous releases have included previously unreleased studio and live material.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He co-invented the first successful open-circuit self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA), called the Aqua-Lung, which assisted him in producing some of the first underwater documentaries.\nCousteau wrote many books describing his undersea explorations. In his first book, \"\", Cousteau surmised the existence of the echolocation abilities of porpoises. The book was adapted into an underwater documentary called \"The Silent World\". Co-directed by Cousteau and Louis Malle, it was one of the first films to use underwater cinematography to document the ocean depths in color. The film won the 1956 at the Cannes Film Festival and remained the only documentary to do so until 2004 (when \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" received the award). It was also awarded the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1957.\nFrom 1966 to 1976, he hosted \"The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau\", a documentary television series. A second documentary series, \"The Cousteau Odyssey\", ran from 1977 to 1982 on public television stations.\nBiography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The sea, the great unifier, is man's only hope. Now, as never before, the old phrase has a literal meaning: We are all in the same boat.\"\nJacques Cousteau\nEarly life.\nCousteau was born on 11 June 1910, in Saint-Andr\u00e9-de-Cubzac, Gironde, France, to Daniel Cousteau and \u00c9lisabeth Duranthon. He had one brother, Pierre-Antoine. Cousteau completed his preparatory studies at the Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas in Paris. In 1930, he entered the \u00c9cole navale and graduated as a gunnery officer. However, an automobile accident, which broke both his arms, cut short his career in naval aviation. The accident forced Cousteau to change his plans to become a naval pilot, so he then indulged his passion for the ocean.\nIn Toulon, where he was serving on the \"Condorcet\", Cousteau carried out his first underwater experiments, thanks to his friend Philippe Tailliez who in 1936 lent him some Fernez underwater goggles, predecessors of modern swimming goggles. Cousteau also belonged to the information service of the French Navy, and was sent on missions to Shanghai and Japan (1935\u20131938) and in the USSR (1939).\nOn 12 July 1937, he married Simone Melchior, his business partner, with whom he had two sons, Jean-Michel (born 1938) and Philippe (1940\u20131979). His sons took part in the adventures of the \"Calypso\". In 1991, six months after his wife Simone's death from cancer, he married Francine Triplet. They already had a daughter Diane Cousteau (born 1980) and a son, Pierre-Yves Cousteau (born 1982, during Cousteau's marriage to his first wife).\nEarly 1940s: innovation of modern underwater diving.\nThe years of World War II were decisive for the history of diving. After the armistice of 1940, the family of Simone and Jacques-Yves Cousteau took refuge in Meg\u00e8ve, where he became a friend of the Ichac family who also lived there. Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Marcel Ichac shared the same desire to reveal to the general public unknown and inaccessible places\u2014for Cousteau the underwater world and for Ichac the high mountains. The two neighbors took the first ex-aequo prize of the Congress of Documentary Film in 1943, for the first French underwater film: \"Par dix-huit m\u00e8tres de fond\" (\"18 meters deep\"), made without breathing apparatus the previous year in the Embiez islands in Var, with Philippe Tailliez and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dumas, using a depth-pressure-proof camera case developed by mechanical engineer L\u00e9on V\u00e8che, an engineer of Arts and Measures at the Naval College.\nIn 1943, they made the film \"\u00c9paves\" (\"Shipwrecks\"), in which they used two of the very first Aqua-Lung prototypes. These prototypes were made in Boulogne-Billancourt by the Air Liquide company, following instructions from Cousteau and \u00c9mile Gagnan.\nHaving kept bonds with the English speakers (he spent part of his childhood in the United States and usually spoke English) and with French soldiers in North Africa (under Admiral Lemonnier), Jacques-Yves Cousteau (whose villa \"Baobab\" at Sanary (Var) was opposite Admiral Darlan's villa \"Reine\"), helped the French Navy to join again with the Allies; he assembled a commando operation against the Italian espionage services in France, and received several military decorations for his deeds. At that time, he kept his distance from his brother Pierre-Antoine Cousteau, a \"pen anti-semite\" who edited the collaborationist newspaper \"Je suis partout\" (\"I am everywhere\") and who received the death sentence in 1946. However, this was later commuted to a life sentence, and Pierre-Antoine was released in 1954.\nDuring the 1940s, Cousteau is credited with improving the Aqua-Lung design which gave birth to the open-circuit scuba technology used today. According to his first book, \"\" (1953), Cousteau started diving with Fernez goggles in 1936, and in 1939 used the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus invented in 1926 by Commander Yves le Prieur. Cousteau was not satisfied with the length of time he could spend underwater with the Le Prieur apparatus so he improved it to extend underwater duration by adding a demand regulator, invented in 1942 by \u00c9mile Gagnan. In 1943 Cousteau tried out the first prototype Aqua-Lung which finally made extended underwater exploration possible.\nLate 1940s: GERS and \"\u00c9lie Monnier\".\nIn 1946, Cousteau and Tailliez showed the film \"\u00c9paves\" (\"Shipwrecks\") to Admiral Lemonnier, who gave them the responsibility of setting up the GRS (\"Groupement de Recherches Sous-marines\", Underwater Research Group) of the French Navy in Toulon. A little later it became the GERS (\"Groupe d'\u00c9tudes et de Recherches Sous-Marines\", Underwater Studies and Research Group), then the COMISMER (\"Commandement des Interventions Sous la Mer\", Undersea Interventions Command), and finally the CEPHISMER (\"Centre Expert Plong\u00e9e Humaine et Intervention Sous la Mer\", Expert Centre for Human Diving and Undersea Intervention). In 1947, Chief Petty Officer Maurice Fargues became the first diver to die using an Aqua-Lung, while attempting a new depth record to 120\u00a0m with the GERS near Toulon.\nIn 1948, between missions of mine clearance, underwater exploration and technological and physiological tests, Cousteau undertook a first campaign in the Mediterranean on board the sloop \"\u00c9lie Monnier\", with Philippe Tailliez, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dumas, Jean Alinat and the scenario writer Marcel Ichac. The small team also undertook the exploration of the Roman wreck of Mahdia (Tunisia). It was the first underwater archaeology operation using autonomous diving, opening the way for scientific underwater archaeology. Cousteau and Marcel Ichac brought back from there the Carnets diving film (presented and preceded with the Cannes Film Festival 1951).\nCousteau and the \"\u00c9lie Monnier\" then took part in the rescue of Professor Jacques Piccard's bathyscaphe, the FNRS-2, during the 1949 expedition to Dakar. Thanks to this rescue, the French Navy was able to reuse the sphere of the bathyscaphe to construct the FNRS-3.\nThe adventures of this period are told in the two books \"\" (1953, by Cousteau and Dumas) and \"Plong\u00e9es sans c\u00e2ble\" (1954, by Philippe Tailliez).\n1950\u20131970s.\nIn 1949, Cousteau left the French Navy.\nIn 1950, he founded the French Oceanographic Campaigns (FOC), and leased a ship called \"Calypso\" from Thomas Loel Guinness for a symbolic one franc a year. Cousteau refitted the \"Calypso\" as a mobile laboratory for field research and as his principal vessel for diving and filming. He also carried out underwater archaeological excavations in the Mediterranean, in particular at Grand-Conglou\u00e9 (1952).\nWith the publication of his first book in 1953, \"\", Cousteau correctly predicted the existence of the echolocation abilities of porpoises. He reported that his research vessel, the \"\u00c9lie Monier\", was heading to the Straits of Gibraltar and noticed a group of porpoises following them. Cousteau changed course a few degrees off the optimal course to the center of the strait, and the porpoises followed for a few minutes, then diverged toward mid-channel again. It was evident that they knew where the optimal course lay, even if the humans did not. Cousteau concluded that the cetaceans had something like sonar, which was a relatively new feature on submarines.\nIn 1954, Cousteau conducted a survey of Abu Dhabi waters on behalf of British Petroleum. Among those accompanying him was Louis Malle who made a black-and-white film of the expedition for the company. Cousteau won the at the Cannes Film Festival in 1956 for \"The Silent World\" co-produced with Malle. In 1957, Cousteau took over as leader of the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. Afterward, with the assistance of Jean Mollard, he made a \"diving saucer\" SP-350, an experimental underwater vehicle which could reach a depth of 350 meters. The successful experiment was quickly repeated in 1965 with two vehicles which reached 500 meters.\nIn 1957, he was elected as director of the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. He directed Pr\u00e9continent, about the experiments of diving in saturation (long-duration immersion, houses under the sea), and was admitted to the United States National Academy of Sciences.\nHe was involved in the creation of Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Mondiale des Activit\u00e9s Subaquatiques and served as its inaugural president from 1959 to 1973.\nCousteau also took part in inventing the \"SP-350 Denise Diving Saucer\" in 1959 which was an invention best for exploring the ocean floor, as it allowed one to explore on solid ground.\nIn October 1960, a large amount of radioactive waste was going to be discarded in the Mediterranean Sea by the Commissariat \u00e0 l'\u00e9nergie atomique (CEA). The CEA argued that the dumps were experimental in nature, and that French oceanographers such as Vsevolod Romanovsky had recommended it. Romanovsky and other French scientists, including Louis Fage and Jacques Cousteau, repudiated the claim, saying that Romanovsky had in mind a much smaller amount. The CEA claimed that there was little circulation (and hence little need for concern) at the dump site between Nice and Corsica, but French public opinion sided with the oceanographers rather than with the CEA atomic energy scientists. The CEA chief, Francis Perrin, decided to postpone the dump. Cousteau organized a publicity campaign which in less than two weeks gained wide popular support. The train carrying the waste was stopped by women and children sitting on the railway tracks, and it was sent back to its origin.\nIn the 1960s, Cousteau was involved with a set of three projects to build underwater \"villages\"; the projects were named Precontinent I, Precontinent II and Precontinent III. Each ensuing project was aimed at increasing the depth at which people continuously lived under water, and were an attempt at creating an environment in which men could live and work on the seafloor. The projects are best known as Conshelf I (1962), Conshelf II (1963), and Conshelf III (1965). The names \"Precontinent\", and \"Continental Shelf Station\" (Conshelf) were used interchangeably by Cousteau.\nA meeting with American television companies (ABC, Metromedia, NBC) created the series \"The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau\", with the character of the commander in the red bonnet inherited from standard diving dress intended to give the films a \"personalized adventure\" style. This documentary television series ran for 10 years from 1966 to 1976. A second documentary series, \"The Cousteau Odyssey\", ran from 1977 to 1982 on public television stations.\nIn 1970, he wrote the book \"The Shark: Splendid Savage of the Sea\" with his son Philippe. In this book, Cousteau described the oceanic whitetip shark as \"the most dangerous of all sharks\".\nIn December 1972, two years after the volcano's last eruption, The Cousteau Society was filming \"Voyage au bout du monde\" on Deception Island, Antarctica, when Michel Laval, \"Calypso\"'s second in command, was struck and killed by a rotor of the helicopter that was ferrying between \"Calypso\" and the island.\nIn 1973, along with his two sons and Frederick Hyman, he created the Cousteau Society for the Protection of Ocean Life, Frederick Hyman being its first President.\nIn 1975, John Denver released the tribute song \"Calypso\" on his album \"Windsong\", and on the B-side of his hit song \"I'm Sorry\". \"Calypso\" became a hit on its own and was later considered the new A-side, reaching No. 2 on the charts.\nIn 1976, Cousteau located the wreck of HMHS \"Britannic\", which had sunk on 21 November 1916 after striking a mine in the Kea Channel, the third and final of the three liners and the younger sister to the RMS \"Olympic\" and RMS \"Titanic\". He also found the wreck of the French 17th-century ship-of-the-line \"La Therese\" in coastal waters of Crete.\nIn 1977, together with Peter Scott, he received the UN International Pahlavi Environment prize.\nOn 28 June 1979, while the \"Calypso\" was on an expedition to Portugal, his second son Philippe, his preferred and designated successor and with whom he had co-produced all his films since 1969, died in a PBY Catalina flying boat crash in the Tagus River near Lisbon. Cousteau was deeply affected. He called his eldest son, the architect Jean-Michel, to his side. This collaboration lasted 14 years.\n1980\u20131990s.\nFrom 1980 to 1981, he was a regular on the animal reality show \"Those Amazing Animals\", along with Burgess Meredith, Priscilla Presley, and Jim Stafford.\nIn 1980, Cousteau traveled to Canada to make two films on the Saint Lawrence River and the Great Lakes, \"Cries from the Deep\" and \"St. Lawrence: Stairway to the Sea\".\nFrom 1982 to 1984, Cousteau released a series of films on the Amazon with TBS.\nIn 1985, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from U.S. President Ronald Reagan. He also released \"Cousteau/Mississippi\", which won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Informational Special.\nFrom 1986 to 1992, Cousteau released \"Rediscovery of the World\", also with TBS.\nOn 24 November 1988, he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, chair 17, succeeding Jean Delay. His official reception under the cupola took place on 22 June 1989, the response to his speech of reception being given by Bertrand Poirot-Delpech. After his death, he was replaced by \u00c9rik Orsenna on 28 May 1998.\nIn June 1990, the composer Jean Michel Jarre paid homage to the commander by entitling his new album \"Waiting for Cousteau\". He also composed the music for Cousteau's documentary \"Palawan, the last refuge\".\nOn 2 December 1990, his wife, Simone Cousteau died of cancer. Six months later, in June 1991, in Paris, Jacques-Yves Cousteau remarried to Francine Triplet, with whom he had a relationship since the early 1980s and two children, Diane (born in 1980) and Pierre-Yves (born in 1982). Francine Cousteau currently continues her husband's work as the head of the Cousteau Foundation and Cousteau Society. From that point, the relations between Jacques-Yves and his elder son, who is 8 years older than Francine, worsened.\nIn November 1991, Cousteau gave an interview to the \"UNESCO Courier\", in which he stated that he was in favour of human population control and population decrease. Widely quoted on the Internet are these two paragraphs from the interview: \"What should we do to eliminate suffering and disease? It's a wonderful idea but perhaps not altogether a beneficial one in the long run. If we try to implement it we may jeopardize the future of our species...It's terrible to have to say this. World population must be stabilized and to do that we must eliminate 350,000 people per day. This is so horrible to contemplate that we shouldn't even say it. But the general situation in which we are involved is lamentable\".\nIn 1992, he was invited to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for the United Nations' International Conference on Environment and Development, and then he became a regular consultant for the UN and the World Bank.\nIn 1993, a brief biography, as well as an introduction by Cousteau was featured in interactive educational software program Undersea Adventure, developed by former game developer Knowledge Adventure.\nIn 1995, Cousteau became involved in a legal battle with his son Jean-Michel, who was advertising the \"Cousteau Fiji Islands Resort\" in the South Pacific, to prevent him from using the Cousteau name for business purposes in the United States. This resulted in Jean-Michel Cousteau being ordered by the court to not encourage confusion between his for-profit business and his father's non-profit endeavours.\nOn 11 January 1996, \"Calypso\" was rammed and sunk in the port of Singapore by a barge. The \"Calypso\" was refloated and towed home to France.\nReligious views.\nArchbishop Jean-Marie Lustiger celebrated his funeral Mass at Notre-Dame in Paris. In his homily he stated, \"Without betraying any confidences, Father Carr\u00e9 told me of his respect for Jacques-Yves Cousteau. He discovered in him a man of prayer whom he accompanied in his last months of his life, giving him, through the sacraments of the Church, the strength of his passage towards eternity.\"\nIn a chapter entitled \"The Holy Scriptures and the Environment\" in the posthumous work \"The Human, the Orchid, and the Octopus\", he is quoted as stating that \"The glory of nature provides evidence that God exists\".\nOpinion on recreational fishing.\nJacques Cousteau said that just because fish are cold-blooded does not mean they do not feel pain, and that recreational fishermen only say so to reassure their conscience.\nDeath and legacy.\nJacques-Yves Cousteau died of a heart attack on 25 June 1997 in Paris, two weeks after his 87th birthday. He was buried in the family vault at Saint-Andr\u00e9-de-Cubzac, his birthplace. An homage was paid to him by the town by naming the street which runs out to the house of his birth \"rue du Commandant Cousteau\", where a commemorative plaque was placed.\nCousteau's legacy includes more than 120 television documentaries, more than 50 books, and an environmental protection foundation with 300,000 members.\nCousteau liked to call himself an \"oceanographic technician\". He was, in reality, a sophisticated showman, teacher, and lover of nature. His work permitted many people to explore the resources of the oceans.\nHis work also created a new kind of scientific communication, criticized at the time by some academics. The so-called \"divulgationism\", a simple way of sharing scientific concepts, was soon employed in other disciplines and became one of the most important characteristics of modern television broadcasting.\nHis Oceanographic Museum in Monaco, and perhaps even he himself, has been identified as introducing the \"Killer Algae\" \"Caulerpa taxifolia\", which are negatively affecting the Mediterranean's ecosystem.\nThe Cousteau Society and its French counterpart, \"l'\u00c9quipe Cousteau\", both of which Jacques-Yves Cousteau founded, are still active today. The Society is currently attempting to turn the original \"Calypso\" into a museum and it is raising funds to build a successor vessel, the \"Calypso II\".\nIn 2007, the International Watch Company introduced the IWC Aquatimer Chronograph \"Cousteau Divers\" Special Edition. The timepiece incorporated a sliver of wood from the interior of Cousteau's Calypso research vessel. Having developed the diver's watch, IWC offered support to The Cousteau Society. The proceeds from the timepieces' sales were partially donated to the non-profit organization involved in conservation of marine life and preservation of tropical coral reefs.\nFabien Cousteau, the grandson of Jacques Cousteau, is in the process of constructing a community of ocean flooring analysis stations, called Proteus, off Cura\u00e7ao at a depth of about 20 m in a marine-protected area. Aquanauts could reside and work in these underwater habitats. Front-end engineering has started in 2022 with the habitat planned for the sea bottom in 2025.\nIn October 1997, an underwater plaque honoring Jacques Cousteau was placed in the underwater dive park off Casino Point in Avalon, California. Because of deterioration, In November 2020 the plaque was replaced.\nAwards and honors.\nDuring his lifetime, Jacques-Yves Cousteau received these distinctions:\nFilmography.\nLegend.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMedia portrayals.\nJacques Cousteau has been portrayed in films:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16253", "revid": "509411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16253", "title": "J. Philippe Rushton", "text": "Canadian psychologist and author (1943\u20132012)\nJohn Philippe Rushton (December 3, 1943 \u2013 October 2, 2012) was a Canadian psychologist and author. He taught at the University of Western Ontario until the early 1990s, and became known to the general public during the 1980s and 1990s for promoting anti-Black racism through his widely discredited research on race and intelligence, race and crime, and other purported racial correlations.\nRushton's work has been heavily criticized by the scientific community for the poor quality of its research, with many academics arguing that it was conducted under a racist agenda. From 2002 until his death, he served as the head of the Pioneer Fund, an organization founded in 1937 to promote eugenics, which has been described as racist and white supremacist in nature, and as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. He also published articles in and spoke at conferences organized by the white supremacist magazine \"American Renaissance\".\nRushton was a Fellow of the Canadian Psychological Association and a onetime Fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. In 2020, the Department of Psychology of the University of Western Ontario released a statement stating that \"much of [Rushton's] research was racist\", was \"deeply flawed from a scientific standpoint\", and \"Rushton's legacy shows that the impact of flawed science lingers on, even after qualified scholars have condemned its scientific integrity.\" As of 2021, Rushton has had six research publications retracted for being scientifically flawed, unethical, and not replicable, and for advancing a racist agenda despite evidence contradictory to his claims.\nEarly life and education.\nRushton was born in Bournemouth, England. During his childhood, he emigrated with his family to South Africa, where he lived from age four to eight (1948\u20131952). His father was a building contractor and his mother came from France. The family moved to Canada, where Rushton spent most of his teen years. He returned to England for university, receiving a B.Sc. in psychology from Birkbeck College at the University of London in 1970, and, in 1973, his Ph.D. in social psychology from the London School of Economics for work on altruism in children. He continued his work at the University of Oxford until 1974.\nLater life and career.\nRushton taught at York University in Canada from 1974 to 1976 and the University of Toronto until 1977. He moved to the University of Western Ontario and was made full professor (with tenure) in 1985. He received a D.Sc. from the University of London in 1992. His controversial research has sparked political debates, and Ontario Premier David Peterson called Rushton a racist. In 2005, \"The Ottawa Citizen\" described Rushton as the most famous university professor in Canada.\nHe published more than 250 articles and six books, including two on altruism, and one on scientific excellence, and co-authored an introductory psychology textbook. He was a signatory of the opinion piece \"Mainstream Science on Intelligence.\"\nRushton died of cancer on October 2, 2012, at the age of 68.\nWork and opinions.\nGenetic similarity theory.\nEarly in his career, Rushton did research on altruism. He theorized a heritable component in altruism and developed \"Genetic Similarity Theory\", which is an extension of W.D. Hamilton's theory of kin selection. It holds that individuals tend to be more altruistic to individuals who are genetically similar to themselves even if they are not kin, and less altruistic, and sometimes outwardly hostile, to individuals who are less genetically similar. Rushton describes \"ethnic conflict and rivalry\" as \"one of the great themes of historical and contemporary society\", and suggests that this may have its roots in the evolutionary impact on individuals from groups \"giving preferential treatment to genetically similar others\". According to Rushton: \"the makeup of a gene pool [i.e., a human population's total reservoir of alternative genes] causally affects the probability of any particular ideology being adopted\".\nArticles in a 1989 issue of \"Behavioral and Brain Sciences\" criticized the theory. Judith Anderson said his work was based on statistically flawed evidence, John Archer and others said that Rushton failed to understand and misapplied the theory of kin selection, Judith Economos said that Rushton's analysis was speculative, that he failed to define the concept of altruistic behavior in a way that it can become manifest, and that he failed to show any plausible mechanism by which members of a species can detect the \"altruism gene\" in other members of the species. Steven Gangestad criticized Rushton's theory for not being compelling in terms of its attractiveness as an explanatory model. C.R. Hallpike said Rushton's theory failed to take into account that many other traits, ranging from age, sex, social and political group membership, are observably more important in predicting altruistic behavior between non-kin than genetic similarity. John Hartung criticized Rushton for failing to conduct an adequate control group study and for ignoring contradictory evidence.\nLittlefield and Rushton (1984) examined degree of bereavement among parents after the death of a child. They found that children perceived as more physically similar to their parents were grieved for more intensely than less similar children. Russell, Wells, and Rushton (1985) reanalyzed several previous studies on similarities between spouses and concluded there is higher similarity on the more heritable characteristics. In 1988 Rushton examined blood group genes and found that sexually interacting couples had more similar blood group genes than randomly paired individuals.\nRace and intelligence.\nRushton spent much of his career arguing that average IQ differences between racial groups are due to genetic causes, a view that was controversial at the time and is now broadly rejected by the scientific consensus. His research areas included studying brain size and the effects of racial admixture.\nIn a 2020 statement, his former department at the University of Western Ontario stated: \"Rushton's works linking race and intelligence are based on an incorrect assumption that fuels systemic racism, the notion that racialized groups are concordant with patterns of human ancestry and genetic population structure.\" Furthermore, they stated that Rushton's work on the topic is \"characterized by a complete misunderstanding of population genetic measures, including fundamental misconceptions about the nature of heritability.\"\nApplication of \"r\"/\"K\" selection theory to race.\nRushton's book \"Race, Evolution, and Behavior\" (1995) attempted to use \"r\"/\"K\" selection theory to explain what he described as an evolutionary scale of characteristics indicative of nurturing behavior in which East Asian people consistently averaged high, black people low, and white people in the middle. He first published this theory in 1984. Rushton argued that East Asians and their descendants average a larger brain size, greater intelligence, more sexual restraint, slower rates of maturation, and greater law abidingness and social organization than do Europeans and their descendants, whom he argued average higher scores on these measures than Africans and their descendants. He hypothesized that \"r\"/\"K\" selection theory explains these differences.\nRushton's application of \"r\"/\"K\" selection theory to explain differences among racial groups has been widely criticized. Differential K theory in particular was described in a 2020 statement by Rushton's former department at Western Ontario University as \"thoroughly debunked.\"\nOne of his many critics is the evolutionary biologist Joseph L. Graves, who has done extensive testing of the \"r\"/\"K\" selection theory with species of Drosophila flies. Graves argues that not only is \"r\"/\"K\" selection theory considered to be virtually useless when applied to human life history evolution, but Rushton does not apply the theory correctly, and displays a lack of understanding of evolutionary theory in general. Graves also says that Rushton misrepresented the sources for the biological data he gathered in support of his hypothesis, and that much of his social science data was collected by dubious means. Other scholars have argued against Rushton's hypothesis on the basis that the concept of race is not supported by genetic evidence about the diversity of human populations, and that his research was based on folk taxonomies.\nLater studies by Rushton and other researchers have argued that there is empirical support for the theory, though these studies too have been criticized.\nPsychologist David P. Barash observed that \"r\"- and \"K\"-selection may have some validity when considering the so-called demographic transition, whereby economic development characteristically leads to reduced family size and other \"K\" traits. \"But this is a pan-human phenomenon, a flexible, adaptive response to changed environmental conditions\u00a0... Rushton wields \"r\"- and \"K\"-selection as a Procrustean bed, doing what he can to make the available data fit\u00a0... Bad science and virulent racial prejudice drip like pus from nearly every page of this despicable book.\"\nDimensional structure of personality.\nBeginning in 2008, Rushton researched the structure of personality. Over about a dozen papers, he argued that variation in personality can be explained by variation in a single underlying \"general factor\", similar to the g factor of psychometrics.\nOpinions.\nIn 2009 Rushton spoke at the \"Preserving Western Civilization\" conference in Baltimore. It was organized by Michael H. Hart for the stated purpose of \"addressing the need\" to defend \"America's Judeo-Christian heritage and European identity\" from immigrants, Muslims, and African Americans. The Anti-Defamation League described the conference attendees as \"racist academics, conservative pundits and anti-immigrant activists\".\nReception.\nPress coverage.\nRushton prompted controversy for years, attracting coverage from the press as well as comments and criticism by scientists of his books and journal articles.\nFirst-year psychology students who took Rushton's classes said that he had conducted a survey of students' sexual habits in 1988, asking \"such questions as how large their penises are, how many sex partners they have had, and how far they can ejaculate\". First-year psychology students at the University of Western Ontario are required \"to participate in approved surveys as a condition of their studies. If they choose not to, they must write one research paper. Also, many students feel subtle pressure to participate in order not to offend professors who may later be grading their work. However, if a study is not approved, these requirements do not apply at all.\" For his failing to tell students they had the option not to participate in his studies without incurring additional work, the university barred Rushton for two years from using students as research subjects. He had tenure at UWO.\nIn a 2005 \"Ottawa Citizen\" article, Rushton stated that the public perceives disproportionately negative effects caused by black residents \"in every bloody city in Canada where you have black\npeople.\" In the same article, Rushton suggested that equalizing outcomes across groups was \"impossible\". The Southern Poverty Law Center called the piece \"yet another attack\" by Rushton, and it criticized those who published his work and that of other \"race scientists\".\nAcademic opinion.\nFavorable.\nIn a 1991 work, the Harvard biologist E. O. Wilson (one of the two co-founders of the \"r\"/\"K\" selection theory which Rushton uses) was quoted as having said about him:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I think Phil is an honest and capable researcher. The basic reasoning by Rushton is solid evolutionary reasoning; that is, it is logically sound. If he had seen some apparent geographic variation for a non-human species\u00a0\u2013 a species of sparrow or sparrow hawk, for example\u00a0\u2013 no one would have batted an eye.\u00a0 ... [W]hen it comes to [human] racial differences, especially in the inflamed situation in this country, special safeguards and conventions need to be developed.\nThree years after the publication of Wilson's 1975 book \"\", Rushton had already begun a long correspondence with Wilson. The letters became particularly extensive between 1987 and 1995 (Wilson's letters have now been archived by the Library of Congress). After Wilson's death at the end of 2021, historians of science Mark Borrello and David Sepkoski have reassessed how Wilson's thinking on issues of race and evolution was influenced by Rushton.\nIn a 1995 review of Rushton's \"Race, Evolution, and Behavior\", anthropologist and population geneticist Henry Harpending expressed doubt as to whether all of Rushton's data fit the \"r\"/\"K\" model he proposed, but nonetheless praised the book for its proposing of a theoretical model that makes testable predictions about differences between human groups. He concludes that \"Perhaps there will ultimately be some serious contribution from the traditional smoke-and-mirrors social science treatment of IQ, but for now Rushton's framework is essentially the only game in town.\" In their 2009 book \"The 10,000 Year Explosion\", Harpending and Gregory Cochran later described Rushton as one of the researchers to whom they are indebted.\nThe psychologists Arthur Jensen, Hans Eysenck, Richard Lynn, Linda Gottfredson and Thomas Bouchard had a high opinion of Rushton's \"Race, Evolution and Behavior\", describing Rushton's work as rigorous and impressive. However, many of these researchers are themselves controversial and they all received money from the Pioneer Fund, which had funded much of Rushton's work when these reviews were written.\nSome criminologists who study the relationship between race and crime regard Rushton's \"r\"/\"K\" theory as one of several possible explanations for racial disparities in crime rates. Others, such as the criminologist Shaun L. Gabbidon, think that Rushton has developed one of the more controversial biosocial theories related to race and crime; he says that it has been criticized for failing to explain all of the data and for its potential to support racist ideologies. The criminologist Anthony Walsh has defended Rushton, claiming that none of Rushton's critics has supplied data indicating anything other than the racial gradient he identifies, and that it is unscientific to dismiss Rushton's ideas on the basis of their political implications.\nUnfavorable.\nOn 22 June 2020, the Department of Psychology at the University of Western Ontario issued a statement regarding their former faculty member, which read in part:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Despite its deeply flawed assumptions and methodologies, Rushton's work and other so-called \"race science\" (currently under the pseudonym of \"race realism\") continues to be misused by white supremacists and promoted by eugenic organizations. Thus, Rushton's legacy shows that the impact of flawed science lingers on, even after qualified scholars have condemned its scientific integrity. Academic freedom and freedom of expression are critical to free scientific inquiry. However, the notion of academic freedom is disrespected and abused when it is used to promote the dissemination of racist and discriminatory concepts. Scientists have an obligation to society to speak loudly and actively in opposition of such abuse.\nAlso in 2020, Andrew Winston summarized Rushton's scholarly reception as follows: \"Rushton's work was heavily criticized by psychologists, evolutionary biologists, anthropologists, and geneticists for severe scientific inadequacies, fundamental errors, inappropriate conceptualization of race, inappropriate statistical comparisons, misuse of sources, and serious logical errors and flaws.\"\nIn 1989, geneticist and media personality David Suzuki criticized Rushton's racial theories in a live televised debate at the University of Western Ontario. He said: \"There will always be Rushtons in science, and we must always be prepared to root them out\". At the same occasion, Rushton rejected believing in racial superiority, saying \"we've got to realize that each of these populations is perfectly, beautifully adapted to their own ancestral environments\".\nAlso in 1989, Michael Lynn published a paper in the \"Journal of Research in Personality\" criticizing a study by Rushton &amp; Bogaert that had been published in the same journal two years earlier. Lynn cited four reasons he considered Rushton &amp; Bogaert's study to be flawed: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;First, they did not explain why natural selection would have favored different reproductive strategies for different races. Second, their data on race differences are of questionable validity because their literature review was selective and their original analyses were based on self-reports. Third, they provided no evidence that these race differences had significant effects on reproduction or that sexual restraint is a \"K\" characteristic. Finally, they did not adequately rule out environmental explanations for their data.\nMarvin Zuckerman, psychology professor of the University of Delaware, criticized Rushton's research on methodological grounds, observing that more variation exists in personality traits within racial groups than between them and arguing that Rushton selectively cited data from the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire.\nCritical psychologist Thomas Teo argued that Rushton's \"substantial success and influence in the discipline\" and use of \"accepted usage of empirical mainstream methods\" pointed to broader problems in academic psychology.\nBiologist Garland E. Allen argued in 1990 that Rushton \"selectively cites and misrepresents his sources to support his conclusions. Far from being an 'honest attempt' to follow the Truth wherever it leads, Rushton seems to be putting a ring through Truth's nose and leading it toward his own barn...He has used, abused, distorted, and in some cases virtually falsified his sources.\"\nAccording to Charles Lane, in 1988, Rushton conducted a survey at the Eaton Centre mall in Toronto, where he paid 50 whites, 50 blacks, and 50 Asians to answer questions about their sexual habits. Because he did not clear his survey and proposed to pay for answers with the university committee at UWO, the administration reprimanded Rushton, calling his transgression \"a serious breach of scholarly procedure\", said University President, George Pederson.\nA 1993 study reanalyzed data from a study Rushton had published on the relationship between race and crime and found no strong relationship between the two.\nRushton's work was criticized in the scholarly literature; he generally responded, sometimes in the same journal. In 1995, in the \"Journal of Black Studies\", Zack Cernovsky wrote: \"some of Rushton's references to scientific literature with respects to racial differences in sexual characteristics turned out to be references to a nonscientific semi-pornographic book and to an article by Philip Nobile in the \"Penthouse\" magazine's Forum.\"\nIn 1995, two researchers published a review and meta-analysis concluding that racial differences in behavior were accounted for entirely by environmental factors, which contradicts Rushton's evolutionary theory for the origin of such differences.\nAnti-racism activist Tim Wise criticized Rushton's application of \"r\"/\"K\" selection theory to crime rates and IQ, charging that Rushton ignored things such as systematic/institutional discrimination, racial profiling, economic disparities and unequal access to judicial defense in his attempt to apply \"r\"/\"K\" Theory and IQ theories to explain racial disparities in American crime rates. He also criticized Rushton and others like him of ignoring things like white-collar crime rates, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Corporate criminals, after all, are usually highly educated, and probably would score highly on just about any standardized test you chose to give them. And what of it? Virtually all the stock manipulators, unethical derivatives traders and shady money managers on Wall Street, whose actions have brought the economy to its knees of late \u2014 and who it might be worth noting are pretty much all white men \u2014 would likely do well on the Stanford-Binet or Wonderlich Industrial Aptitude Test. They probably were above-average students. But what are we to make of these facts? Clearly they say little about the value of such persons to the nation or the world. The Unabomber was a certified genius and Ted Bundy was of well-above-average intelligence... But I'm having a hard time discerning what we should conclude about these truths, in terms of how much emphasis we place on intelligence, as opposed to other human traits.\nThe biological anthropologist C. Loring Brace criticized Rushton in his 1996 review of the book, \"Race, Evolution, and Behavior\" (1996):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Virtually every kind of anthropologist may be put in the position of being asked to comment on what is contained in this book, so, whatever our individual specialty, we should all be prepared to discuss what it represents. \"Race, Evolution, and Behavior\" is an amalgamation of bad biology and inexcusable anthropology. It is not science but advocacy, and advocacy for the promotion of \"racialism.\" Tzvetan Todorov explains \"racialism,\" in contrast to \"racism,\" as belief in the existence of typological essences called \"races\" whose characteristics can be rated in hierarchical fashion (\"On Human Diversity: Nationalism, Racism, and Exoticism in French Thought,\" Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1993, p. 31). \"Racism,\" then, is the use of racialist assumptions to promote social or political ends, a course that Todorov regards as leading to \"particularly catastrophic results.\" Perpetuating catastrophe is not the stated aim of Rushton's book, but current promoters of racist agendas will almost certainly regard it as a welcome weapon to apply for their noxious purposes.\nRobert Sussman, an evolutionary anthropologist and the editor-in-chief of \"American Anthropologist\", explained why the journal did not accept ads for Rushton's 1998 book:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This is an insidious attempt to legitimize Rushton's racist propaganda and is tantamount to publishing ads for white supremacy and the neo-Nazi party. If you have any question about the validity of the \"science\" of Rushton's trash you should read any one of his articles and the many rebuttals by ashamed scientists.\nIn 2000, after Rushton mailed a booklet on his work to psychology, sociology, and anthropology professors across North America, Hermann Helmuth, a professor of anthropology at Trent University, said: \"It is in a way personal and political propaganda. There is no basis to his scientific research.\" Rushton responded, \"It's not racist; it's a matter of science and recognizing variation in all groups of people.\"\nFrom 2002, Rushton was the president of the Pioneer Fund. Tax records show that in 2002 his Charles Darwin Research Institute was awarded $473,835, or 73% of the fund's total grants that year. The Southern Poverty Law Center, an American civil rights organization, characterizes the Pioneer Fund as a hate group. Rushton had spoken on eugenics several times at conferences of the \"American Renaissance\" magazine, a monthly white supremacist magazine, in which he had also published a number of general articles.\nRushton published articles on the website VDARE, which advocates for reduced immigration into the United States. Stefan K\u00fchl wrote in his book, \"The Nazi Connection: Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism\" (2002), that Rushton was part of the revival in the 1980s of public interest in scientific racism.\nWilliam H. Tucker, a professor of psychology and expert on the history of scientific racism, observed in 2002:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Rushton has not only contributed to \"American Renaissance\" publications and graced their conferences with his presence but also offered praise and support for the \"scholarly\" work on racial differences of Henry Garrett, who spent the last two decades of his life opposing the extension of the Constitution to blacks on the basis that the \"normal\" black resembled a European after frontal lobotomy. Informed of Garrett's assertion that blacks were not entitled to equality because their \"ancestors were ... savages in an African jungle,\" Rushton dismissed the observation as quoted \"selectively from Garrett's writing\", finding nothing opprobrious in such sentiments because the leader of the scientific opposition to civil rights had made other statements about black inferiority that were, according to Rushton, \"quite objective in tone and backed by standard social science evidence.\" Quite apart from the questionable logic in defending a blatant call to deprive citizens of their rights by citing Garrett's less offensive writing\u2014as if it were evidence of Ted Bundy's innocence that there were some women he had met and not killed\u2014there was no sense on Rushton's part that all of Garrett's assertions, whether or not \"objective,\" were utterly irrelevant to constitutional guarantees, which are not predicated on scientific demonstrations of intellectual equality.\nA 2003 study in \"Evolution and Human Behavior\" found no evidence to support Rushton's hypothesized relationship between race and behavior.\nIn 2005, Lisa Suzuki and Joshua Aronson of New York University wrote an article for \"Psychology, Public Policy, and Law\" noting that Rushton ignored evidence that failed to support his position that IQ test score gaps represent a genetic racial hierarchy. He did not change his position on this matter for 30 years. Rushton replied in the same issue of the journal.\nIn a paper for the \"International Journal of Selection and Assessment\" in 2006, Steven Cronshaw and colleagues wrote that psychologists need to critically examine the science used by Rushton in his \"race-realist\" research. Their re-analysis of the validity criteria for test bias, using data reported in the \"Rushton et al.\" paper, led them to conclude that the testing methods were biased against Black Africans. They disagree with other aspects of Rushton's methodology, such as his use of non-equivalent groups in test samples. Rushton responded in the next issue of the journal. He said why he believed his results were valid, and why he thought the criticisms incorrect.\nScott McGreal (2012) in \"Psychology Today\" criticized the science of Rushton's \"Race Differences in Sexual Behavior: Testing an Evolutionary Hypothesis\". He cited Weizmann, Wiener, Wiesenthal, &amp; Ziegle, which argued that Rushton's theory relied on flawed science. McGreal faulted Rushton and his use of Nobile's penis size study.\nOn 17 June 2020, academic publisher Elsevier announced it was retracting an article that Rushton and Donald Templer had published in 2012 in the Elsevier journal \"Personality and Individual Differences\". The article falsely claimed that there was scientific evidence that skin color was related to aggression and sexuality in humans.\nOn 24 December 2020, the academic journal \"Psychological Reports\" retracted two Rushton articles about intelligence and race. Review of the articles, which were originally published in the 1990s, \"found that the research was unethical, scientifically flawed, and based on racist ideas and agenda\". On 23 August 2021, it retracted three more.\nPersonal life.\nRushton was married to biological anthropologist Elizabeth Weiss, who taught Anthropology at the San Jose State University. Weiss, after arguing that archaeologists \"have let creationism\" into the discipline, for which she cited NAGPRA's \"religious criteria,\" sued the university's authorities claiming that, in retaliation for her views, they'd restricted her access to skeletal remains she was studying. The suit was settled in June 2023, with Weiss voluntarily retiring with full benefits.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16261", "revid": "11241628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16261", "title": "Juliana Hatfield", "text": "American guitarist/singer-songwriter and author\nJuliana Hatfield (born July 27, 1967) is an American musician and singer-songwriter from the Boston area. She was formerly a member of the indie rock bands Blake Babies, Some Girls, and the Lemonheads. Hatfield also fronted her own band, The Juliana Hatfield Three, alongside bassist Dean Fisher and drummer Todd Philips, which was active in the mid-1990s and again in the mid-2010s. With The Juliana Hatfield Three, she achieved her best-charting work, including the critically acclaimed album \"Become What You Are\" (1993), which featured the singles \"My Sister\" (1993) and \"Spin the Bottle\".\nShe has performed and recorded as a solo artist and as one-half of Minor Alps with Matthew Caws of Nada Surf. In 2014, she reformed The Juliana Hatfield Three and announced the release of the album \"Whatever, My Love\" in 2015.\nIn 2016, she collaborated with Paul Westerberg under the moniker the I Don't Cares to release the album \"Wild Stab\". She later released an album of original work titled \"Weird\" (2019), along with three albums of cover songs: \"Juliana Hatfield Sings Olivia Newton-John\" (2018), \"Juliana Hatfield Sings The Police\" (2019), and \"Juliana Hatfield Sings ELO\" (2023).\nEarly life.\nHatfield was born in Wiscasset, Maine, to Phillip M. Hatfield, a radiologist, and Julie Hatfield, a former fashion editor for \"The Boston Globe\". She grew up in Duxbury, Massachusetts, near Boston. Despite recording a song titled \"My Sister,\" Hatfield has no sisters but does have two brothers.\nHer father claimed that their family descended from the West Virginia Hatfields of the Hatfield\u2013McCoy feud following the Civil War. He also served in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam War.\nHatfield attended Duxbury High School in Duxbury, Massachusetts. She first enrolled at Boston University before transferring to Berklee College of Music in Boston. In 2012, she attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where she completed a year-long post-baccalaureate certificate program in painting.\nMusic career.\nFirst bands and solo album.\nHatfield developed a love for rock music during the 1970s after a babysitter introduced her to the Los Angeles punk rock band X, an experience she described as life-changing. She was also drawn to the music of more mainstream artists, including Olivia Newton-John and The Police.\nWhile still attending Berklee College of Music in 1986, Hatfield formed the band Blake Babies with John Strohm and Freda Love. The band released four albums between 1987 and 1991, gaining critical recognition from \"Rolling Stone\" and \"The Village Voice\", as well as local radio airplay and press coverage. They also received label support from Mammoth Records in North Carolina. Blake Babies disbanded in 1992 but briefly reunited in 2001 to release another album.\nAfter Blake Babies disbanded, Hatfield joined the Lemonheads as their bassist, replacing founding member Jesse Peretz. She played on their breakthrough 1992 album, \"It's a Shame About Ray.\" After about a year, she left the band but returned in 1993 as a guest vocalist on several tracks of \"Come on Feel the Lemonheads\".\nIn 1992, Hatfield released her debut solo album, \"Hey Babe\".\nThe Juliana Hatfield Three.\nHer commercial breakthrough came in 1993 when she formed the band the Juliana Hatfield Three. Along with her high-school friend Dean Fisher on bass and former Bullet LaVolta drummer Todd Philips, she handled lead vocals and lead guitar duties. The band released the album \"Become What You Are\" and two hit singles, \"My Sister\" and \"Spin the Bottle.\"\n\"My Sister\" was inspired by Hatfield's older brother's girlfriend, Maggie Rafferty, who lived with the family while Hatfield was in high school. Hatfield enjoyed Rafferty's eclectic record collection and was also introduced to live music, as Rafferty took her to see the Del Fuegos and the Violent Femmes, which inspired Hatfield to form a band.\n\"Spin the Bottle\" was featured on the soundtrack of the film \"Reality Bites\" (1994). Hatfield also made the cover of \"Spin\" magazine.\nHatfield was profiled in several girls' magazines, most notably \"Sassy\", where she addressed serious issues faced by young women in her songs and interviews. Reflecting on this period, she said, \"I was never comfortable with the attention. I thought it had come too soon. I hadn't earned it yet.\" In 1992, she gained notoriety for revealing in \"Interview\" magazine that she was still a virgin in her mid-twenties. In a 1994 interview with \"Vox\", she expressed surprise at the reaction to her 'outing': \"I think there are a lot of people out there who don't care about sex, but who you never hear from, so I thought I should say it. The magazine I did the interview for is full of beefcake hunky guys and scantily clad models, so I thought it would be really funny to say that I didn't care about sex in a magazine that's full of sex and beauty \u2013 but no one really got the joke.\"\nOver the years, Hatfield's virginity became a recurring theme in her press coverage, often accompanied by speculation that she had lost it to the Lemonheads' leader, Evan Dando, who referred to her as his \"friend and sometimes girlfriend.\" In 2006, Hatfield sent a letter to \"The Weekly Dig\" in response to writer Debbie Driscoll's scathing review of Soul Asylum's latest album, \"The Silver Lining\". Kevin Dean from the newspaper responded by bringing up the subject of Hatfield losing her virginity to Dando. Hatfield fired back at Dean for bringing up her sex life, clarifying that she and Dando never had sex, and revealing that it was actually Spike Jonze to whom she had lost her virginity. She later admitted that she lost her virginity at 26 and was \"damn ready.\"\nReturn to solo career.\nThe Juliana Hatfield Three remained together only through 1994. By 1995, Hatfield had returned to solo status and released the album \"Only Everything\", in which she \"turned up the volume and the distortion and had a lot of fun.\" One reviewer described it as \"a fun, engaging pop album.\" The album produced another alternative radio hit for Hatfield with \"Universal Heartbeat.\" In the video, Hatfield portrayed a demanding aerobics instructor. Before the tour for \"Only Everything\", she released Phillips and hired Jason Sutter on drums, Ed Slanker on guitar, and Lisa Mednick on keyboards. However, two weeks into the tour, she canceled it due to depression.\nIn her memoir, Hatfield writes that she was suffering from depression severe enough to be suicidal. She disagreed with the decision to avoid talking about her depression. The drummer was replaced by Phillips, and touring resumed with Jeff Buckley as the opening act.\nIn 1996, Hatfield traveled to Woodstock, New York, where she recorded tracks for \"God's Foot\", which was intended to be her fourth solo album (or third, if \"Become What You Are\"\u2014recorded with The Juliana Hatfield Three\u2014is not counted). The album was planned for release in 1997. After three unsuccessful attempts to satisfy Atlantic Records' requests for a single, she asked to be released from her contract. The label agreed but retained the rights to the songs recorded during these sessions. \"Mountains of Love\" and \"Fade Away\" were later released on a greatest hits collection titled \"Gold Stars\", while \"Can't Kill Myself\" was made available for download on Hatfield's website. The remaining tracks surfaced on bootlegs, which she disapproved of, and she has rarely performed them live.\nIn 1997, Hatfield toured with Lilith Fair, an all-female rock festival co-founded by singer Sarah McLachlan.\nAfter the experience of \"God's Foot\" and being freed from her label obligations, Hatfield recorded the EP \"Please Do Not Disturb\" for the independent label Bar/None. Produced by Hatfield, the album featured drummer Todd Phillips, guitarists Ed Slanker and Mike Leahy, and bassist Mikey Welsh of Weezer. The EP included \"Trying Not to Think About It,\" a tribute to her friend and deceased musician Jeff Buckley.\nAlmost as a reaction to the seemingly endless studio sessions surrounding \"God's Foot\", Hatfield recorded the album \"Bed\" in 1998 in just six days. About the album, she said on her website, \"It sounds as raw as I felt. It has no pretty sheen. The mistakes and unattractive parts were left in, not erased. Just like my career. Just like life.\"\nIn 2000, Hatfield released \"Beautiful Creature\". However, this album left the rockier side of her musical personality unexpressed, so she simultaneously released \"\" with Zephan Courtney and Mikey Welsh. She described the latter album as \"a loud release of tension\" with \"lots of long sloppy guitar solos. And no love songs... a not-at-all attractive reaction to the ugly side of humanity, specifically American culture.\" \"Billboard\" called \"Beautiful Creature\" \"a collection of plaintive demos\" and \"Juliana's Pony\" \"chock-a-block with punk guitar missives.\" \"Juliana's Pony: Total System Failure\" was panned by some critics who preferred the more acoustic \"Beautiful Creature\". On \"Beautiful Creature\", Hatfield worked with musician Dav\u00edd Garza, who co-produced much of the album. Wally Gagel, a producer for Sebadoh and Tanya Donelly, helped Hatfield record her most electronica-influenced songs, \"Cool Rock Boy\" and \"Don't Rush Me,\" which added texture to the otherwise acoustic album.\nIn 2002, Hatfield released \"\". The compilation included singles from her solo albums, two songs from the unreleased \"God's Foot\", a cover of Neil Young's \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart,\" and new songs.\nIn 2004, Hatfield released \"In Exile Deo\", an attempt at a more commercial sound with input from producers and engineers who had worked with Pink and Avril Lavigne. Hatfield co-produced the album with David Leonard, receiving co-production credits on \"Jamie's in Town\" and the bright rocker \"Sunshine.\" Critics praised the album, with some calling it her best work since the start of her solo career.\nYe Olde Records.\nIn contrast, the 2005 album \"Made in China\" was recorded in Bellows Falls, Vermont, and Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was released on her own record label, Ye Olde Records. The album had a much rawer feel, with Hatfield playing instruments alongside the band Unbusted and other contributors. For the first time, Hatfield also played drums on at least one track.\nJohn Doe of the band X described the album as \"a frighteningly dark and beautiful record filled with stark, angular, truly brutal songs and guitars. This is surely a 'Woman Under the Influence,' though I'm not sure of what.\" Reviews were mixed, with some appreciating the lo-fi sound while others viewed it as slackness.\nThe release of \"Made in China\" marked the beginning of a trend where Hatfield licensed her music, selling it via her website and through a distribution deal with Red Eye.\nIn December 2005, Hatfield toured the United States with the band X, whom she had idolized during her teenage years.\nIn 2006, Hatfield released her first live album, \".\" The album featured performances from her tour with X and was her third release on her record label.\nHatfield's ninth studio album, \"How to Walk Away\", was released on August 19, 2008, on Ye Olde Records. The album's heartfelt exploration of the breakup of a relationship resonated with critics, who gave it largely positive reviews, with some hailing it as her best album since \"In Exile Deo\".\nHatfield returned two years later with her tenth studio album, \"Peace &amp; Love,\" which was released on Ye Olde Records on February 16, 2010. The album's composition, arrangement, performance, production, engineering, and mixing were all credited solely to Hatfield. The album received mixed reviews, with several critics complaining that its low-key, moody nature worked against the potential of the songs.\nIn October 2010, Hatfield and Evan Dando played two sold-out acoustic live shows together at The Mercury Lounge in New York. The following month, the duo played sold-out shows in Allston. This tour was followed by five dates on the American East Coast in January 2011.\nPledgeMusic.\nIn April 2011, Hatfield announced her intention to work on a new album via the fan-funding platform PledgeMusic. Fan response was enthusiastic, exceeding 400% of the original project cost. The album was initially going to be titled \"Speeches Delivered to Animals and Plants\", referencing a passage in the John Irving novel \"The World According to Garp\", but Hatfield later changed it to \"There's Always Another Girl.\" The new title referred to a song on the album of the same name, which she had written as a defense of Lindsay Lohan after watching her film \"I Know Who Killed Me\".\n\"There's Always Another Girl\" was released on August 30, 2011, independently on her Ye Olde Records label. However, a downloadable version was made available to contributors a month earlier, on July 27, which was Juliana's birthday. The album has received mostly positive reviews from critics.\nOn August 28, 2012, Juliana Hatfield released a covers album titled \"Juliana Hatfield\" on her Ye Olde Records label. The album features covers of songs originally performed by the Who, Liz Phair, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Ryan Adams, I Blame Coco, and Led Zeppelin.\nIn December 2014, \"Paste Magazine\" named her track \"Needle in the Hay,\" a cover of Elliott Smith's song, as No. 10 on its list of the \"20 Best Cover Songs of 2014.\" The review described the cover as \"a more upbeat, approachable take on Smith's disparate, wrought-iron classic. But even though it now employs bass, drums, tambourine, and synth, the song stays true to the sorrowful, tension-riddled original.\" Also that month, \"SPIN Magazine\" named the cover one of the \"40 Best 2014 Songs by 1994 Artists,\" where it ranked No. 36. The review noted, \"The tempo's a bit quicker, and she double-tracks herself for the song's entirety. But the (tasteful) inclusion of chintzy drum programming and mellotron cleverly point to Smith's eventual creative direction.\"\nReformation of the Juliana Hatfield Three.\nIn 2014, the Juliana Hatfield Three reunited two decades after it disbanded. Hatfield used PledgeMusic to raise funds for the new album, \"Whatever, My Love\", the trio's first since 1993's \"Become What You Are\". Hatfield explained, \"We haven't totally reinvented the wheel or anything,\" adding that the tracks feature \"stuff I am sort of known for, I guess. But I am a lot more confident now than I was then with the first album. And I had more fun recording this one.\" The twelve tracks for \"Whatever, My Love\" were recorded at Nuthouse Recording in Hoboken, New Jersey, with Beaujour and Hatfield co-producing. The lead single, \"If I Could\" was released in December 2014 and premiered in \"Rolling Stone\". That month, the album was made available for pre-order on American Laundromat Records, with an announced release date of February 17, 2015. The band also announced a U.S. tour throughout February, visiting cities on both coasts and in the Midwest, with stops at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City and The Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles.\nIn late December 2014, \"Stereogum\" named the album \"one of their most anticipated albums of 2015,\" and on January 4, 2015, \"Consequence of Sound\" listed it as \"one of the 50 most anticipated albums of 2015.\" On January 9, 2015, Hatfield was featured on Nylon.com, which wrote that the upcoming album came across as \"unforced, and with its sly lyrics and mega-hooky coffeehouse-grunge aesthetic.\" The album's second single, \"Ordinary Guy,\" premiered on \"Consequence of Sound\" on January 14, 2015.\nRecent collaborations and solo work.\nIn 2015, Hatfield and Paul Westerberg announced that they had formed a new group called the I Don't Cares. They released the album \"Wild Stab\" in 2016.\nSince then, Hatfield has released a number of solo albums, including two albums of cover songs\u2014\"Juliana Hatfield Sings Olivia Newton-John\" (2018) and \"Juliana Hatfield Sings The Police\" (2019)\u2014and three albums of original work: \"Pussycat\" (2017), \"Weird\" (2019), and \"Blood\" (2021).\nIn 2019, Hatfield hinted that her next covers album would focus on the work of an American artist, having already covered an Australian (Olivia Newton-John) and an English band (the Police). In an interview for the book \"I'm Your Fan: The Songs of Leonard Cohen\", Hatfield revealed that she was considering R.E.M. for her next covers album installment. However, the follow-up ended up being Electric Light Orchestra. The album, \"Juliana Hatfield Sings ELO\", was released on November 17, 2023.\nMusical style.\nStyle and influences.\nFrom her work with the Blake Babies to the present, Hatfield's music has alternated between heavy, rocking tunes and gentler, more melodic or folk-oriented songs. She has stated that in the 1990s, she briefly tried smoking cigarettes in hopes of giving her voice a rougher quality but eventually reconciled herself with her distinctive vocal style.\nHatfield's musical influences are diverse, ranging from punk bands like X, the Stooges, and the Replacements to more folk-oriented rock artists like Neil Young, whose songs the Blake Babies frequently covered in live shows. Her work has also intersected with contemporaneous indie rock bands such as Dinosaur Jr. and the Lemonheads, whose members are also her friends.\nFrom an early age, she has had a particular love for melodic pop music. In a 1998 interview, she stated, \"I just always liked pop music and really good melodies and major chords. That's just the type of music that comes naturally to me.\" In a 1993 interview with \"Melody Maker\", Hatfield mentioned that her enthusiasm for the pop group Wilson Phillips apparently contributed, at least in part, to the breakup of the Blake Babies.\nLyrics.\nHatfield describes herself as very shy and somewhat of a loner, stating that \"happy lyrics don't come naturally to me.\" She has characterized her music and songwriting as a form of therapy, providing an outlet that helps her navigate difficult times and depression.\nCollaborations.\nHatfield has also recorded with the Lemonheads, living for a time with Evan Dando in Boston's college neighborhood of Allston. She has contributed backing vocals to recordings by Belly, Giant Sand, Susanna Hoffs, Aimee Mann, and Mary Lou Lord. In 1999, she teamed up with Dando to record Gram Parsons's song \"$1,000 Wedding\" for the compilation \"\".\nSome Girls.\nIn 2001, Hatfield joined Freda Love and Heidi Gluck (of the Pieces and the Only Children) to form the trio Some Girls, performing alongside her solo work. The group has toured the United States twice and released two albums, serving as an outlet for Hatfield's more lighthearted material. Their first album, \"Feel It\", was released by Koch Records in 2003, featuring the lead single \"Necessito\", a funky affirmation of the power of music sung in a mix of English and Spanish. Some Girls' second album, \"Crushing Love\", was released in July 2006.\nFrank Smith.\nIn 2007, Hatfield signed the Boston (now Austin)-based band Frank Smith to her record label, Ye Olde Records. In addition to releasing their 2007 album \"Heavy Handed Peace and Love\", she recorded an EP with the band titled \"Sittin' in a Tree\". Produced by Frank Smith's Aaron Sinclair, the EP features banjos, pedal steel, and other instruments typically associated with country music.\nMinor Alps.\nHatfield and Matthew Caws of Nada Surf formed a band called Minor Alps, releasing their first album, \"Get There\", on October 29, 2013, via Barsuk Records.\nJulie Gayet appears in the music video for Minor Alps' song \"Waiting for You\".\nThe I Don't Cares.\nHatfield and Paul Westerberg formed the I Don't Cares, releasing \"Wild Stab\" on January 22, 2016, via Dry Wood Records.\nWriting and acting.\nBeyond her musical accomplishments, Hatfield has guest-starred on several television shows, including \"The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete\" as a lunch lady and the 1994 Christmas episode of the cult classic \"My So-Called Life\" as a deceased homeless girl who becomes an angel.

Part of the agreement was for a Joint Political Military Group (JPMG) as a high-level planning forum to discuss and implement combined planning, joint exercises, and logistics. The JPMG is co-chaired by the director general of the Israeli Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. The JPMG meets biannually, alternating between Israel and the United States.\nThe JPMG was originally intended to discuss means of countering Soviet involvement in the Middle East. But more recently the concern has been over the spread of chemical weapons and ballistic missiles.\nHistory.\nMilitary relations between the United States and Israel improved under the Reagan Administration. The Reagan Administration sought to build an \"anti-Soviet strategic consensus in the Middle East.\" At the time, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and Israeli Minister of Defense Ariel Sharon signed a memorandum of understanding in 1981 \"establishing a framework for continued consultation and cooperation to enhance\" national security. This agreement led to the establishment of the Joint Political Military Group, which has since met regularly to \"address\" foreign military sales to Israel, joint exercises and simulations, and logistical arrangements. Joint air and sea exercises started in 1984.\nPresent status.\nAs part of the agreement, the United States and Israel meet twice a year to honor the obligations of the memorandum of understanding. In 2001 an annual \"inter-agency strategic dialogue\" including representatives from all areas of defense and intelligence was created.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16266", "revid": "1175300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16266", "title": "John William Polidori", "text": "English writer and physician\nJohn William Polidori (7 September 1795 \u2013 24 August 1821) was an English writer and physician. He is known for his associations with the Romantic movement and credited by some as the creator of the vampire genre of fantasy fiction. \nHis most successful work was the short story \"The Vampyre\" (1819), the first published modern vampire story. Although the story was at first erroneously credited to Lord Byron, both Byron and Polidori affirmed that the author was Polidori.\nFamily.\nJohn William Polidori was born on 7 September 1795 in Westminster, the eldest son of Gaetano Polidori, an Italian political \u00e9migr\u00e9 scholar of Greek descent, and his wife Anna Maria Pierce, an English governess. He had three brothers and four sisters.\nHis sister Frances Polidori married the exiled Italian scholar Gabriele Rossetti, and thus Polidori, posthumously, became the uncle of Maria Francesca Rossetti, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Michael Rossetti, and Christina Georgina Rossetti. William Michael Rossetti published Polidori's journal in 1911.\nBiography.\nJohn Polidori was one of the earliest pupils at the recently established Ampleforth College in North Yorkshire from 1804. In 1810 he went up to the University of Edinburgh, where he wrote a thesis on sleepwalking and received his degree as a doctor of medicine on 1 August 1815, at the age of 19.\nIn 1816, which became known as the Year Without a Summer, Polidori entered Lord Byron's service as his personal physician and accompanied him on a trip through Europe. Publisher John Murray offered Polidori 500 English pounds to keep a diary of their travels, which Polidori's nephew William Michael Rossetti later edited. At the Villa Diodati, a house Byron rented by Lake Geneva in Switzerland, the pair met with Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, her husband-to-be, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and their companion (Mary's stepsister) Claire Clairmont.\nOne night in June after the company had read aloud from \"Fantasmagoriana\", a French collection of German horror tales, Byron suggested they each write a ghost story. Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote \"A Fragment of a Ghost Story\" and wrote down five ghost stories recounted by Matthew Gregory \"Monk\" Lewis, published posthumously as the \"Journal at Geneva (including ghost stories) and on Return to England, 1816\", the journal entries beginning on 18 August 1816. Mary Shelley worked on a tale that would later evolve into \"Frankenstein\". Byron wrote (and quickly abandoned) a fragment of a story, \"A Fragment\", featuring the main character Augustus Darvell, which Polidori used later as the basis for his own tale, \"The Vampyre\", the first published modern vampire story in English.\nPolidori's conversation with Percy Bysshe Shelley on 15 June 1816, as recounted in \"The Diary\", is regarded as the origin or genesis of \"Frankenstein\". They discussed \"the nature of the principle of life\": \"June 15 - ... Shelley etc. came in the evening ... Afterwards, Shelley and I had a conversation about principles \u2014 whether man was to be thought merely an instrument.\"\nDismissed by Byron, Polidori travelled in Italy and then returned to England. His story, \"The Vampyre\", which featured the main character Lord Ruthven, was published in the April 1819 issue of \"New Monthly Magazine\" without his permission. Whilst in London he lived on Great Pulteney Street in Soho. Much to both his and Byron's chagrin, \"The Vampyre\" was released as a new work by Byron. Byron's own vampire story \"Fragment of a Novel\" or \"A Fragment\" was published in 1819 in an attempt to clear up the confusion, but, for better or worse, \"The Vampyre\" continued to be attributed to him.\nPolidori's long, Byron-influenced theological poem \"The Fall of the Angels\" was published anonymously in 1821.\nDeath.\nJohn Polidori died at his father's London house on 24 August 1821, weighed down by depression and gambling debts. Despite conjecture from his family that he died by suicide by means of prussic acid, the coroner gave a verdict of death by natural causes.\nPosthumous editions.\nHis sister Charlotte transcribed Polidori's diaries, but censored \"peccant passages\" and destroyed the original. Based only on the transcription, \"The Diary of John Polidori\" was edited by William Michael Rossetti and first published in 1911 by Elkin Mathews (London). Reprints of this book, \"The Diary of Dr. John William Polidori, 1816, relating to Byron, Shelley, etc.\", was published by Folcroft Library Editions (Folcroft, PA) in 1975, and by Norwood Editions (Norwood, PA) in 1978. A new edition of \"The Diary of John William Polidori\" was reprinted by Cornell University in 2009.\nLegacy.\nMemorials.\nA memorial plaque on John Polidori's home at 38 Great Pulteney Street was unveiled on 15 July 1998 by the Italian Ambassador, Paolo Galli.\nAppearances in other media.\nFilm.\nMultiple films have depicted John Polidori, and the genesis of the \"Frankenstein\" and \"Vampyre\" stories in 1816:\nAdditionally, Polidori's name was used for fictional characters in the following films:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16267", "revid": "1505786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16267", "title": "Joke", "text": "Display of humor using words\nA joke is a display of humour in which words are used within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people laugh and is usually not meant to be interpreted literally. It usually takes the form of a story, often with dialogue, and ends in a punch line, whereby the humorous element of the story is revealed; this can be done using a pun or other type of word play, irony or sarcasm, logical incompatibility, hyperbole, or other means. Linguist Robert Hetzron offers the definition:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A joke is a short humorous piece of oral literature in which the funniness culminates in the final sentence, called the punchline\u2026 In fact, the main condition is that the tension should reach its highest level at the very end. No continuation relieving the tension should be added. As for its being \"oral,\" it is true that jokes may appear printed, but when further transferred, there is no obligation to reproduce the text verbatim, as in the case of poetry.\nIt is generally held that jokes benefit from brevity, containing no more detail than is needed to set the scene for the punchline at the end. In the case of riddle jokes or one-liners, the setting is implicitly understood, leaving only the dialogue and punchline to be verbalised. However, subverting these and other common guidelines can also be a source of humour\u2014the shaggy dog story is an example of an anti-joke; although presented as a joke, it contains a long drawn-out narrative of time, place and character, rambles through many pointless inclusions and finally fails to deliver a punchline. Jokes are a form of humour, but not all humour is in the form of a joke. Some humorous forms which are \"not\" verbal jokes are: involuntary humour, situational humour, practical jokes, slapstick and anecdotes.\nIdentified as one of the simple forms of oral literature by the Dutch linguist Andr\u00e9 Jolles, jokes are passed along anonymously. They are told in both private and public settings; a single person tells a joke to his friend in the natural flow of conversation, or a set of jokes is told to a group as part of scripted entertainment. Jokes are also passed along in written form or, more recently, through the internet.\nStand-up comics, comedians and slapstick work with comic timing and rhythm in their performance, and may rely on actions as well as on the verbal punchline to evoke laughter. This distinction has been formulated in the popular saying \"A comic says funny things; a comedian says things funny\".\nHistory in print.\nJokes do not belong to refined culture, but rather to the entertainment and leisure of all classes. As such, any printed versions were considered ephemera, i.e., temporary documents created for a specific purpose and intended to be thrown away. Many of these early jokes deal with scatological and sexual topics, entertaining to all social classes but not to be valued and saved.\nVarious kinds of jokes have been identified in ancient pre-classical texts. The oldest identified joke is an ancient Sumerian proverb from 1900 BC containing toilet humour: \"Something which has never occurred since time immemorial; a young woman did not fart in her husband's lap.\" Its records were dated to the Old Babylonian period and the joke may go as far back as 2300 BC. The second oldest joke found, discovered on the Westcar Papyrus and believed to be about Sneferu, was from Ancient Egypt c.\u20091600 BC: \"How do you entertain a bored pharaoh? You sail a boatload of young women dressed only in fishing nets down the Nile and urge the pharaoh to go catch a fish.\" The tale of the three ox drivers from Adab completes the three known oldest jokes in the world. This is a comic triple dating back to 1200 BC Adab. It concerns three men seeking justice from a king on the matter of ownership over a newborn calf, for whose birth they all consider themselves to be partially responsible. The king seeks advice from a priestess on how to rule the case, and she suggests a series of events involving the men's households and wives. The final portion of the story (which included the punch line), has not survived intact, though legible fragments suggest it was bawdy in nature.\nJokes can be notoriously difficult to translate from language to language; particularly puns, which depend on specific words and not just on their meanings. For instance, Julius Caesar once sold land at a surprisingly cheap price to his lover Servilia, who was rumoured to be prostituting her daughter Tertia to Caesar in order to keep his favour. Cicero remarked that \"conparavit Servilia hunc fundum tertia deducta.\" The punny phrase, \"tertia deducta\", can be translated as \"with one-third off (in price)\", or \"with Tertia putting out.\"\nThe earliest extant joke book is the \"Philogelos\" (Greek for \"The Laughter-Lover\"), a collection of 265 jokes written in crude ancient Greek dating to the fourth or fifth century AD. The author of the collection is obscure and a number of different authors are attributed to it, including \"Hierokles and Philagros the \"grammatikos\"\", just \"Hierokles\", or, in the \"Suda\", \"Philistion\". British classicist Mary Beard states that the \"Philogelos\" may have been intended as a jokester's handbook of quips to say on the fly, rather than a book meant to be read straight through. Many of the jokes in this collection are surprisingly familiar, even though the typical protagonists are less recognisable to contemporary readers: the absent-minded professor, the eunuch, and people with hernias or bad breath. The \"Philogelos\" even contains a joke similar to Monty Python's \"Dead Parrot Sketch\".\nDuring the 15th century, the printing revolution spread across Europe following the development of the movable type printing press. This was coupled with the growth of literacy in all social classes. Printers turned out Jestbooks along with Bibles to meet both lowbrow and highbrow interests of the populace. One early anthology of jokes was the \"Facetiae\" by the Italian Poggio Bracciolini, first published in 1470. The popularity of this jest book can be measured on the twenty editions of the book documented alone for the 15th century. Another popular form was a collection of jests, jokes and funny situations attributed to a single character in a more connected, narrative form of the picaresque novel. Examples of this are the characters of Rabelais in France, Till Eulenspiegel in Germany, Lazarillo de Tormes in Spain and Master Skelton in England. There is also a jest book ascribed to William Shakespeare, the contents of which appear to both inform and borrow from his plays. All of these early jestbooks corroborate both the rise in the literacy of the European populations and the general quest for leisure activities during the Renaissance in Europe.\nThe practice of printers using jokes and cartoons as page fillers was also widely used in the broadsides and chapbooks of the 19th century and earlier. With the increase in literacy in the general population and the growth of the printing industry, these publications were the most common forms of printed material between the 16th and 19th centuries throughout Europe and North America. Along with reports of events, executions, ballads and verse, they also contained jokes. Only one of many broadsides archived in the Harvard library is described as \"1706. Grinning made easy; or, Funny Dick's unrivalled collection of curious, comical, odd, droll, humorous, witty, whimsical, laughable, and eccentric jests, jokes, bulls, epigrams, &amp;c. With many other descriptions of wit and humour.\" These cheap publications, ephemera intended for mass distribution, were read alone, read aloud, posted and discarded.\nThere are many types of joke books in print today; a search on the internet provides a plethora of titles available for purchase. They can be read alone for solitary entertainment, or used to stock up on new jokes to entertain friends. Some people try to find a deeper meaning in jokes, as in \"Plato and a Platypus Walk into a Bar... Understanding Philosophy Through Jokes\". However a deeper meaning is not necessary to appreciate their inherent entertainment value. Magazines frequently use jokes and cartoons as filler for the printed page. \"Reader's Digest\" closes out many articles with an (unrelated) joke at the bottom of the article. \"The New Yorker\" was first published in 1925 with the stated goal of being a \"sophisticated humour magazine\" and is still known for its cartoons.\nTelling jokes.\nTelling a joke is a cooperative effort; it requires that the teller and the audience mutually agree in one form or another to understand the narrative which follows as a joke. In a study of conversation analysis, the sociologist Harvey Sacks describes in detail the sequential organisation in the telling of a single joke. \"This telling is composed, as for stories, of three serially ordered and adjacently placed types of sequences \u2026 the preface [framing], the telling, and the response sequences.\" Folklorists expand this to include the context of the joking. Who is telling what jokes to whom? And why is he telling them when? The context of the joke-telling in turn leads into a study of joking relationships, a term coined by anthropologists to refer to social groups within a culture who engage in institutionalised banter and joking.\nFraming: \"Have you heard the one\u2026\".\nFraming is done with a (frequently formulaic) expression which keys the audience in to expect a joke. \"Have you heard the one\u2026\", \"Reminds me of a joke I heard\u2026\", \"So, a lawyer and a doctor\u2026\"; these conversational markers are just a few examples of linguistic frames used to start a joke. Regardless of the frame used, it creates a social space and clear boundaries around the narrative which follows. Audience response to this initial frame can be acknowledgement and anticipation of the joke to follow. It can also be a dismissal, as in \"this is no joking matter\" or \"this is no time for jokes\".\nThe performance frame serves to label joke-telling as a culturally marked form of communication. Both the performer and audience understand it to be set apart from the \"real\" world. \"An elephant walks into a bar\u2026\"; a person sufficiently familiar with both the English language and the way jokes are told automatically understands that such a compressed and formulaic story, being told with no substantiating details, and placing an unlikely combination of characters into an unlikely setting and involving them in an unrealistic plot, is the start of a joke, and the story that follows is not meant to be taken at face value (i.e. it is non-bona-fide communication). The framing itself invokes a play mode; if the audience is unable or unwilling to move into play, then nothing will seem funny.\nTelling.\nFollowing its linguistic framing the joke, in the form of a story, can be told. It is not required to be verbatim text like other forms of oral literature such as riddles and proverbs. The teller can and does modify the text of the joke, depending both on memory and the present audience. The important characteristic is that the narrative is succinct, containing only those details which lead directly to an understanding and decoding of the punchline. This requires that it support the same (or similar) divergent scripts which are to be embodied in the punchline.\nPunchline.\nThe punchline is intended to make the audience laugh. A linguistic interpretation of this punchline/response is elucidated by Victor Raskin in his Script-based Semantic Theory of Humour. Humour is evoked when a trigger contained in the punchline causes the audience to abruptly shift its understanding of the story from the primary (or more obvious) interpretation to a secondary, opposing interpretation. \"The punchline is the pivot on which the joke text turns as it signals the shift between the [semantic] scripts necessary to interpret [re-interpret] the joke text.\" To produce the humour in the verbal joke, the two interpretations (i.e. scripts) need to both be compatible with the joke text and opposite or incompatible with each other. Thomas R. Shultz, a psychologist, independently expands Raskin's linguistic theory to include \"two stages of incongruity: perception and resolution.\" He explains that \"\u2026 incongruity alone is insufficient to account for the structure of humour. [\u2026] Within this framework, humour appreciation is conceptualized as a biphasic sequence involving first the discovery of incongruity followed by a resolution of the incongruity.\" In the case of a joke, that resolution generates laughter.\nThis is the point at which the field of neurolinguistics offers some insight into the cognitive processing involved in this abrupt laughter at the punchline. Studies by the cognitive science researchers Coulson and Kutas directly address the theory of script switching articulated by Raskin in their work. The article \"Getting it: Human event-related brain response to jokes in good and poor comprehenders\" measures brain activity in response to reading jokes. Additional studies by others in the field support more generally the theory of two-stage processing of humour, as evidenced in the longer processing time they require. In the related field of neuroscience, it has been shown that the expression of laughter is caused by two partially independent neuronal pathways: an \"involuntary\" or \"emotionally driven\" system and a \"voluntary\" system. This study adds credence to the common experience when exposed to an off-colour joke; a laugh is followed in the next breath by a disclaimer: \"Oh, that's bad\u2026\" Here the multiple steps in cognition are clearly evident in the stepped response, the perception being processed just a breath faster than the resolution of the moral/ethical content in the joke.\nResponse.\nExpected response to a joke is laughter. The joke teller hopes the audience \"gets it\" and is entertained. This leads to the premise that a joke is actually an \"understanding test\" between individuals and groups. If the listeners do not get the joke, they are not understanding the two scripts which are contained in the narrative as they were intended. Or they do \"get it\" and do not laugh; it might be too obscene, too gross or too dumb for the current audience. A woman might respond differently to a joke told by a male colleague around the water cooler than she would to the same joke overheard in a women's lavatory. A joke involving toilet humour may be funnier told on the playground at elementary school than on a college campus. The same joke will elicit different responses in different settings. The punchline in the joke remains the same, however, it is more or less appropriate depending on the current context.\nShifting contexts, shifting texts.\nThe context explores the specific social situation in which joking occurs. The narrator automatically modifies the text of the joke to be acceptable to different audiences, while at the same time supporting the same divergent scripts in the punchline. The vocabulary used in telling the same joke at a university fraternity party and to one's grandmother might well vary. In each situation, it is important to identify both the narrator and the audience as well as their relationship with each other. This varies to reflect the complexities of a matrix of different social factors: age, sex, race, ethnicity, kinship, political views, religion, power relationships, etc. When all the potential combinations of such factors between the narrator and the audience are considered, then a single joke can take on infinite shades of meaning for each unique social setting.\nThe context, however, should not be confused with the function of the joking. \"Function is essentially an abstraction made on the basis of a number of contexts\". In one long-term observation of men coming off the late shift at a local caf\u00e9, joking with the waitresses was used to ascertain sexual availability for the evening. Different types of jokes, going from general to topical into explicitly sexual humour signalled openness on the part of the waitress for a connection. This study describes how jokes and joking are used to communicate much more than just good humour. That is a single example of the function of joking in a social setting, but there are others. Sometimes jokes are used simply to get to know someone better. What makes them laugh, what do they find funny? Jokes concerning politics, religion or sexual topics can be used effectively to gauge the attitude of the audience to any one of these topics. They can also be used as a marker of group identity, signalling either inclusion or exclusion for the group. Among pre-adolescents, \"dirty\" jokes allow them to share information about their changing bodies. And sometimes joking is just simple entertainment for a group of friends.\nRelationships.\nThe context of joking in turn leads to a study of joking relationships, a term coined by anthropologists to refer to social groups within a culture who take part in institutionalised banter and joking. These relationships can be either one-way or a mutual back and forth between partners. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The joking relationship is defined as a peculiar combination of friendliness and antagonism. The behaviour is such that in any other social context it would express and arouse hostility; but it is not meant seriously and must not be taken seriously. There is a pretence of hostility along with a real friendliness. To put it in another way, the relationship is one of permitted disrespect. Joking relationships were first described by anthropologists within kinship groups in Africa. But they have since been identified in cultures around the world, where jokes and joking are used to mark and reinforce appropriate boundaries of a relationship.\nElectronic.\nThe advent of electronic communications at the end of the 20th century introduced new traditions into jokes. A verbal joke or cartoon is emailed to a friend or posted on a bulletin board; reactions include a replied email with a :-) or LOL, or a forward on to further recipients. Interaction is limited to the computer screen and for the most part solitary. While preserving the text of a joke, both context and variants are lost in internet joking; for the most part, emailed jokes are passed along verbatim. The framing of the joke frequently occurs in the subject line: \"RE: laugh for the day\" or something similar. The forward of an email joke can increase the number of recipients exponentially.\nInternet joking forces a re-evaluation of social spaces and social groups. They are no longer only defined by physical presence and locality, they also exist in the connectivity in cyberspace. \"The computer networks appear to make possible communities that, although physically dispersed, display attributes of the direct, unconstrained, unofficial exchanges folklorists typically concern themselves with\". This is particularly evident in the spread of topical jokes, \"that genre of lore in which whole crops of jokes spring up seemingly overnight around some sensational event \u2026 flourish briefly and then disappear, as the mass media move on to fresh maimings and new collective tragedies\". This correlates with the new understanding of the internet as an \"active folkloric space\" with evolving social and cultural forces and clearly identifiable performers and audiences.\nA study by the folklorist Bill Ellis documented how an evolving cycle was circulated over the internet. By accessing message boards that specialised in humour immediately following the 9/11 disaster, Ellis was able to observe in real-time both the topical jokes being posted electronically and responses to the jokes. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Previous folklore research has been limited to collecting and documenting successful jokes, and only after they had emerged and come to folklorists' attention. Now, an Internet-enhanced collection creates a time machine, as it were, where we can observe what happens in the period before the risible moment, when attempts at humour are unsuccessful Access to archived message boards also enables us to track the development of a single joke thread in the context of a more complicated virtual conversation.\nJoke cycles.\nA joke cycle is a collection of jokes about a single target or situation which displays consistent narrative structure and type of humour. Some well-known cycles are elephant jokes using nonsense humour, dead baby jokes incorporating black humour, and light bulb jokes, which describe all kinds of operational stupidity. Joke cycles can centre on ethnic groups, professions (viola jokes), catastrophes, settings (\u2026walks into a bar), absurd characters (wind-up dolls), or logical mechanisms which generate the humour (knock-knock jokes). A joke can be reused in different joke cycles; an example of this is the same Head &amp; Shoulders joke refitted to the tragedies of Vic Morrow, Admiral Mountbatten and the crew of the Challenger space shuttle. These cycles seem to appear spontaneously, spread rapidly across countries and borders only to dissipate after some time. Folklorists and others have studied individual joke cycles in an attempt to understand their function and significance within the culture.\nJoke cycles circulated in the recent past include:\nTragedies and catastrophes.\nAs with the 9/11 disaster discussed above, cycles attach themselves to celebrities or national catastrophes such as the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the death of Michael Jackson, and the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. These cycles arise regularly as a response to terrible unexpected events which command the national news. An in-depth analysis of the Challenger joke cycle documents a change in the type of humour circulated following the disaster, from February to March 1986. \"It shows that the jokes appeared in distinct 'waves', the first responding to the disaster with clever wordplay and the second playing with grim and troubling images associated with the event\u2026The primary social function of disaster jokes appears to be to provide closure to an event that provoked communal grieving, by signalling that it was time to move on and pay attention to more immediate concerns\".\nEthnic jokes.\nThe sociologist Christie Davies has written extensively on ethnic jokes told in countries around the world. In ethnic jokes he finds that the \"stupid\" ethnic target in the joke is no stranger to the culture, but rather a peripheral social group (geographic, economic, cultural, linguistic) well known to the joke tellers. So Americans tell jokes about Polacks and Italians, Germans tell jokes about Ostfriesens, and the English tell jokes about the Irish. In a review of Davies' theories it is said that \"For Davies, [ethnic] jokes are more about how joke tellers imagine themselves than about how they imagine those others who serve as their putative targets\u2026The jokes thus serve to center one in the world \u2013 to remind people of their place and to reassure them that they are in it.\"\nAbsurdities and gallows humour.\nA third category of joke cycles identifies absurd characters as the butt: for example the grape, the dead baby or the elephant. Beginning in the 1960s, social and cultural interpretations of these joke cycles, spearheaded by the folklorist Alan Dundes, began to appear in academic journals. Dead baby jokes are posited to reflect societal changes and guilt caused by widespread use of contraception and abortion beginning in the 1960s. Elephant jokes have been interpreted variously as stand-ins for American blacks during the Civil Rights Era or as an \"image of something large and wild abroad in the land captur[ing] the sense of counterculture\" of the sixties. These interpretations strive for a cultural understanding of the themes of these jokes which go beyond the simple collection and documentation undertaken previously by folklorists and ethnologists.\nClassification systems.\nAs folktales and other types of oral literature became collectables throughout Europe in the 19th century (Brothers Grimm et al.), folklorists and anthropologists of the time needed a system to organise these items. The Aarne\u2013Thompson classification system was first published in 1910 by Antti Aarne, and later expanded by Stith Thompson to become the most renowned classification system for European folktales and other types of oral literature. Its final section addresses anecdotes and jokes, listing traditional humorous tales ordered by their protagonist; \"This section of the Index is essentially a classification of the older European jests, or merry tales \u2013 humorous stories characterized by short, fairly simple plots. \u2026\" Due to its focus on older tale types and obsolete actors (e.g., numbskull), the Aarne\u2013Thompson Index does not provide much help in identifying and classifying the modern joke.\nA more granular classification system used widely by folklorists and cultural anthropologists is the Thompson Motif Index, which separates tales into their individual story elements. This system enables jokes to be classified according to individual motifs included in the narrative: actors, items and incidents. It does not provide a system to classify the text by more than one element at a time while at the same time making it theoretically possible to classify the same text under multiple motifs.\nThe Thompson Motif Index has spawned further specialised motif indices, each of which focuses on a single aspect of one subset of jokes. A sampling of just a few of these specialised indices have been listed under other motif indices. Here one can select an index for medieval Spanish folk narratives, another index for linguistic verbal jokes, and a third one for sexual humour. To assist the researcher with this increasingly confusing situation, there are also multiple bibliographies of indices as well as a how-to guide on creating your own index.\nSeveral difficulties have been identified with these systems of identifying oral narratives according to either tale types or story elements. A first major problem is their hierarchical organisation; one element of the narrative is selected as the major element, while all other parts are arrayed subordinate to this. A second problem with these systems is that the listed motifs are not qualitatively equal; actors, items and incidents are all considered side-by-side. And because incidents will always have at least one actor and usually have an item, most narratives can be ordered under multiple headings. This leads to confusion about both where to order an item and where to find it. A third significant problem is that the \"excessive prudery\" common in the middle of the 20th century means that obscene, sexual and scatological elements were regularly ignored in many of the indices.\nThe folklorist Robert Georges has summed up the concerns with these existing classification systems: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2026Yet what the multiplicity and variety of sets and subsets reveal is that folklore [jokes] not only takes many forms, but that it is also multifaceted, with purpose, use, structure, content, style, and function all being relevant and important. Any one or combination of these multiple and varied aspects of a folklore example [such as jokes] might emerge as dominant in a specific situation or for a particular inquiry. It has proven difficult to organise all different elements of a joke into a multi-dimensional classification system which could be of real value in the study and evaluation of this (primarily oral) complex narrative form.\nThe General Theory of Verbal Humour or GTVH, developed by the linguists Victor Raskin and Salvatore Attardo, attempts to do exactly this. This classification system was developed specifically for jokes and later expanded to include longer types of humorous narratives. Six different aspects of the narrative, labelled Knowledge Resources or KRs, can be evaluated largely independently of each other, and then combined into a concatenated classification label. These six KRs of the joke structure include:\nAs development of the GTVH progressed, a hierarchy of the KRs was established to partially restrict the options for lower-level KRs depending on the KRs defined above them. For example, a lightbulb joke (SI) will always be in the form of a riddle (NS). Outside of these restrictions, the KRs can create a multitude of combinations, enabling a researcher to select jokes for analysis which contain only one or two defined KRs. It also allows for an evaluation of the similarity or dissimilarity of jokes depending on the similarity of their labels. \"The GTVH presents itself as a mechanism \u2026 of generating [or describing] an infinite number of jokes by combining the various values that each parameter can take. \u2026 Descriptively, to analyze a joke in the GTVH consists of listing the values of the 6 KRs (with the caveat that TA and LM may be empty).\" This classification system provides a functional multi-dimensional label for any joke, and indeed any verbal humour.\nJoke and humour research.\nMany academic disciplines lay claim to the study of jokes (and other forms of humour) as within their purview. Fortunately, there are enough jokes, good, bad and worse, to go around. The studies of jokes from each of the interested disciplines bring to mind the tale of the blind men and an elephant where the observations, although accurate reflections of their own competent methodological inquiry, frequently fail to grasp the beast in its entirety. This attests to the joke as a traditional narrative form which is indeed complex, concise and complete in and of itself. It requires a \"multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and cross-disciplinary field of inquiry\" to truly appreciate these nuggets of cultural insight.\nPsychology.\nSigmund Freud was one of the first modern scholars to recognise jokes as an important object of investigation. In his 1905 study \"Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious\" Freud describes the social nature of humour and illustrates his text with many examples of contemporary Viennese jokes. His work is particularly noteworthy in this context because Freud distinguishes in his writings between jokes, humour and the comic. These are distinctions which become easily blurred in many subsequent studies where everything funny tends to be gathered under the umbrella term of \"humour\", making for a much more diffuse discussion.\nSince the publication of Freud's study, psychologists have continued to explore humour and jokes in their quest to explain, predict and control an individual's \"sense of humour\". Why do people laugh? Why do people find something funny? Can jokes predict character, or vice versa, can character predict the jokes an individual laughs at? What is a \"sense of humour\"? A current review of the popular magazine \"Psychology Today\" lists over 200 articles discussing various aspects of humour; in psychological jargon, the subject area has become both an emotion to measure and a tool to use in diagnostics and treatment. A new psychological assessment tool, the Values in Action Inventory developed by the American psychologists Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman includes humour (and playfulness) as one of the core character strengths of an individual. As such, it could be a good predictor of life satisfaction. For psychologists, it would be useful to measure both how much of this strength an individual has and how it can be measurably increased.\nA 2007 survey of existing tools to measure humour identified more than 60 psychological measurement instruments. These measurement tools use many different approaches to quantify humour along with its related states and traits. There are tools to measure an individual's physical response by their smile; the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is one of several tools used to identify any one of multiple types of smiles. Or the laugh can be measured to calculate the funniness response of an individual; multiple types of laughter have been identified. It must be stressed here that both smiles and laughter are not always a response to something funny. In trying to develop a measurement tool, most systems use \"jokes and cartoons\" as their test materials. However, because no two tools use the same jokes, and across languages this would not be feasible, how does one determine that the assessment objects are comparable? Moving on, whom does one ask to rate the sense of humour of an individual? Does one ask the person themselves, an impartial observer, or their family, friends and colleagues? Furthermore, has the current mood of the test subjects been considered; someone with a recent death in the family might not be much prone to laughter. Given the plethora of variants revealed by even a superficial glance at the problem, it becomes evident that these paths of scientific inquiry are mined with problematic pitfalls and questionable solutions.\nThe psychologist Willibald Ruch has been very active in the research of humour. He has collaborated with the linguists Raskin and Attardo on their General Theory of Verbal Humour (GTVH) classification system. Their goal is to empirically test both the six autonomous classification types (KRs) and the hierarchical ordering of these KRs. Advancement in this direction would be a win-win for both fields of study; linguistics would have empirical verification of this multi-dimensional classification system for jokes, and psychology would have a standardised joke classification with which they could develop verifiably comparable measurement tools.\nLinguistics.\n\"The linguistics of humor has made gigantic strides forward in the last decade and a half and replaced the psychology of humor as the most advanced theoretical approach to the study of this important and universal human faculty.\" This recent statement by one noted linguist and humour researcher describes, from his perspective, contemporary linguistic humour research. Linguists study words, how words are strung together to build sentences, how sentences create meaning which can be communicated from one individual to another, and how our interaction with each other using words creates discourse. Jokes have been defined above as oral narratives in which words and sentences are engineered to build toward a punchline. The linguist's question is: what exactly makes the punchline funny? This question focuses on how the words used in the punchline create humour, in contrast to the psychologist's concern (see above) with the audience's response to the punchline. The assessment of humour by psychologists \"is made from the individual's perspective; e.g. the phenomenon associated with responding to or creating humor and not a description of humor itself.\" Linguistics, on the other hand, endeavours to provide a precise description of what makes a text funny.\nTwo major new linguistic theories have been developed and tested within the last decades. The first was advanced by Victor Raskin in \"Semantic Mechanisms of Humor\", published 1985. While being a variant on the more general concepts of the incongruity theory of humour, it is the first theory to identify its approach as exclusively linguistic. The Script-based Semantic Theory of Humour (SSTH) begins by identifying two linguistic conditions which make a text funny. It then goes on to identify the mechanisms involved in creating the punchline. This theory established the semantic/pragmatic foundation of humour as well as the humour competence of speakers.\nSeveral years later the SSTH was incorporated into a more expansive theory of jokes put forth by Raskin and his colleague Salvatore Attardo. In the General Theory of Verbal Humour, the SSTH was relabelled as a Logical Mechanism (LM) (referring to the mechanism which connects the different linguistic scripts in the joke) and added to five other independent Knowledge Resources (KR). Together these six KRs could now function as a multi-dimensional descriptive label for any piece of humorous text.\nLinguistics has developed further methodological tools which can be applied to jokes: discourse analysis and conversation analysis of joking. Both of these subspecialties within the field focus on \"naturally occurring\" language use, i.e. the analysis of real (usually recorded) conversations. One of these studies has already been discussed above, where Harvey Sacks describes in detail the sequential organisation in telling a single joke. Discourse analysis emphasises the entire context of social joking, the social interaction which cradles the words.\nFolklore and anthropology.\nFolklore and cultural anthropology have perhaps the strongest claims on jokes as belonging to their bailiwick. Jokes remain one of the few remaining forms of traditional folk literature transmitted orally in western cultures. Identified as one of the \"simple forms\" of oral literature by Andr\u00e9 Jolles in 1930, they have been collected and studied since there were folklorists and anthropologists abroad in the lands. As a genre they were important enough at the beginning of the 20th century to be included under their own heading in the Aarne\u2013Thompson index first published in 1910: Anecdotes and jokes.\nBeginning in the 1960s, cultural researchers began to expand their role from collectors and archivists of \"folk ideas\" to a more active role of interpreters of cultural artefacts. One of the foremost scholars active during this transitional time was the folklorist Alan Dundes. He started asking questions of tradition and transmission with the key observation that \"No piece of folklore continues to be transmitted unless it means something, even if neither the speaker nor the audience can articulate what that meaning might be.\" In the context of jokes, this then becomes the basis for further research. Why is the joke told right now? Only in this expanded perspective is an understanding of its meaning to the participants possible.\nThis questioning resulted in a blossoming of monographs to explore the significance of many joke cycles. What is so funny about absurd nonsense elephant jokes? Why make light of dead babies? In an article on contemporary German jokes about Auschwitz and the Holocaust, Dundes justifies this research: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Whether one finds Auschwitz jokes funny or not is not an issue. This material exists and should be recorded. Jokes are always an important barometer of the attitudes of a group. The jokes exist and they obviously must fill some psychic need for those individuals who tell them and those who listen to them. A stimulating generation of new humour theories flourishes like mushrooms in the undergrowth: Elliott Oring's theoretical discussions on \"appropriate ambiguity\" and Amy Carrell's hypothesis of an \"audience-based theory of verbal humor (1993)\" to name just a few.\nIn his book \"Humor and Laughter: An Anthropological Approach\", the anthropologist Mahadev Apte presents a solid case for his own academic perspective. \"Two axioms underlie my discussion, namely, that humor is by and large culture based and that humor can be a major conceptual and methodological tool for gaining insights into cultural systems.\" Apte goes on to call for legitimising the field of humour research as \"humorology\"; this would be a field of study incorporating an interdisciplinary character of humour studies.\nWhile the label \"humorology\" has yet to become a household word, great strides are being made in the international recognition of this interdisciplinary field of research. The International Society for Humor Studies was founded in 1989 with the stated purpose to \"promote, stimulate and encourage the interdisciplinary study of humour; to support and cooperate with local, national, and international organizations having similar purposes; to organize and arrange meetings; and to issue and encourage publications concerning the purpose of the society\". It also publishes \"\" and holds yearly conferences to promote and inform its speciality.\nPhysiology of laughter.\nIn 1872, Charles Darwin published one of the first \"comprehensive and in many ways remarkably accurate description of laughter in terms of respiration, vocalization, facial action and gesture and posture\" (Laughter) in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. In this early study Darwin raises further questions about who laughs and why they laugh; the myriad responses since then illustrate the complexities of this behaviour. To understand laughter in humans and other primates, the science of gelotology (from the Greek \"\", meaning laughter) has been established; it is the study of laughter and its effects on the body from both a psychological and physiological perspective. While jokes can provoke laughter, laughter cannot be used as a one-to-one marker of jokes because there are multiple stimuli to laughter, humour being just one of them. The other six causes of laughter listed are social context, ignorance, anxiety, derision, acting apology, and tickling. As such, the study of laughter is a secondary albeit entertaining perspective in an understanding of jokes.\nComputational humour.\nComputational humour is a new field of study which uses computers to model humour; it bridges the disciplines of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. A primary ambition of this field is to develop computer programs which can both generate a joke and recognise a text snippet as a joke. Early programming attempts have dealt almost exclusively with punning because this lends itself to simple straightforward rules. These primitive programs display no intelligence; instead, they work off a template with a finite set of pre-defined punning options upon which to build.\nMore sophisticated computer joke programs have yet to be developed. Based on our understanding of the SSTH / GTVH humour theories, it is easy to see why. The linguistic scripts (a.k.a. frames) referenced in these theories include, for any given word, a \"large chunk of semantic information surrounding the word and evoked by it [...] a cognitive structure internalized by the native speaker\". These scripts extend much further than the lexical definition of a word; they contain the speaker's complete knowledge of the concept as it exists in his world. As insentient machines, computers lack the encyclopaedic scripts which humans gain through life experience. They also lack the ability to gather the experiences needed to build wide-ranging semantic scripts and understand language in a broader context, a context that any child picks up in daily interaction with his environment.\nFurther development in this field must wait until computational linguists have succeeded in programming a computer with an ontological semantic natural language processing system. It is only \"the most complex linguistic structures [which] can serve any formal and/or computational treatment of humor well\". Toy systems (i.e. dummy punning programs) are completely inadequate to the task. Despite the fact that the field of computational humour is small and underdeveloped, it is encouraging to note the many interdisciplinary efforts which are currently underway.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lawrence referred to his style as \"dynamic cubism\", an art form popularized in Europe which drew great inspiration from West African and Meso-American art. For his compositions, Lawrence found inspiration in everyday life in Harlem. He brought the African-American experience to life using blacks and browns juxtaposed with vivid colors. He also taught and spent 16 years as a professor at the University of Washington.\nLawrence is among the best known twentieth-century African-American painters, known for his modernist illustrations of everyday life as well as narratives of African-American history and historical figures. At the age of 23 he gained national recognition with his 60-panel \"The Migration Series\", which depicted the Great Migration of African Americans from the rural South to the urban North. The series was purchased jointly by the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., and the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. Lawrence's works are in the permanent collections of numerous museums, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Reynolda House Museum of American Art, and the Museum of Northwest Art. His 1947 painting \"The Builders\" hangs in the White House.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nJacob Lawrence was born September 7, 1917, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where his parents had migrated from the rural south. They divorced in 1924. His mother put him and his two younger siblings into foster care in Philadelphia. When he was 13, he and his siblings moved to New York City, where he reconnected with his mother in Harlem. Lawrence was introduced to art shortly after that when their mother enrolled him in after-school classes at an arts and crafts settlement house in Harlem, called Utopia Children's Center, in an effort to keep him busy. The young Lawrence often drew patterns with crayons. In the beginning, he copied the patterns of his mother's carpets.\nAfter dropping out of school at 16, Lawrence worked in a laundromat and a printing plant. He continued with art, attending classes at the Harlem Art Workshop, taught by the noted African-American artist Charles Alston. Alston urged him to attend the Harlem Community Art Center, led by the sculptor Augusta Savage. Savage secured a scholarship to the American Artists School for Lawrence and a paid position with the Works Progress Administration, established during the Great Depression by the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Lawrence continued his studies as well, working with Alston and Henry Bannarn, another Harlem Renaissance artist, in the Alston-Bannarn workshop. He also studied at Harlem Art Workshop in New York in 1937. Harlem provided crucial training for the majority of Black artists in the United States. Lawrence was one of the first artists trained in and by the African-American community in Harlem. Throughout his lengthy artistic career, Lawrence concentrated on exploring the history and struggles of African Americans.\nThe \"hard, bright, brittle\" aspects of Harlem during the Great Depression inspired Lawrence as much as the colors, shapes, and patterns inside the homes of its residents. \"Even in my mother's home,\" Lawrence told historian Paul Karlstrom, \"people of my mother's generation would decorate their homes in all sorts of color... so you'd think in terms of Matisse.\" He used water-based media throughout his career. Lawrence started to gain some notice for his dramatic and lively portrayals of both contemporary scenes of African-American urban life as well as historical events, all of which he depicted in crisp shapes, bright, clear colors, dynamic patterns, and through revealing posture and gestures.\nCareer.\nAt the very start of his career he developed the approach that made his reputation and remained his touchstone: creating series of paintings that told a story or, less often, depicted many aspects of a subject. His first were biographical accounts of key figures of the African diaspora. He was just 21 years old when his series of 41 paintings of the Haitian general Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture, who led the revolution of the slaves that eventually gained independence, was shown in an exhibit of African-American artists at the Baltimore Museum of Art. This was followed by a series of paintings of the lives of Harriet Tubman (1938\u201339) and Frederick Douglass (1939\u201340). His early work involved general depictions of everyday life in Harlem and also a major series dedicated to African-American history (1940\u20131941).\nHis teacher Charles Alston assesses Lawrence's work in an essay for an exhibition at the Harlem YMCA 1938:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Having thus far miraculously escaped the imprint of academic ideas and current vogues in art... he has followed a course of development dictated by his own inner motivations... Working in the very limited medium of flat tempera he achieved a richness and brilliance of color harmonies both remarkable and exciting... Lawrence symbolizes more than anyone I know, the vitality, the seriousness and promise of a new and socially conscious generation of Negro artists.\nOn July 24, 1941, Lawrence married the painter Gwendolyn Knight, also a student of Savage. She helped prepare the gesso panels for his paintings and contributed to the captions for the paintings in his multi-painting works.\n\"The Migration Series\".\nLawrence completed the 60-panel set of narrative paintings entitled \"The Migration of the Negro\" or \"And the Migrants Kept Coming\", now called the \"Migration Series\", in 1940\u201341. The series portrayed the Great Migration, when hundreds of thousands of African Americans moved from the rural South to the urban North after World War I. Because he was working in tempera, which dries rapidly, he planned all the paintings in advance and then applied a single color wherever he was using it across all the scenes to maintain tonal consistency. Only then did he proceed to the next color. The series was exhibited at the Downtown Gallery in Greenwich Village, which made him the first African-American artist represented by a New York gallery. This brought him national recognition. Selections from this series were featured in a 1941 issue of \"Fortune\". The entire series was purchased jointly and divided by the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., which holds the odd-numbered paintings, and New York's Museum of Modern Art, which holds the even-numbered.\nAnother biographical series of twenty-two panels devoted to the abolitionist John Brown followed in 1941\u201342. When these pairings became too fragile to display, Lawrence, working on commission, recreated the paintings as a portfolio of silkscreen prints in 1977.\nIn 1943, Howard Devree, wrote for \"The New York Times\", that Lawrence in his next series of thirty images had \"even more successfully concentrated his attention on the many-sided life of his people in Harlem\". He called the set \"an amazing social document\" and wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Lawrence's color is fittingly vivid for his interpretations. A strong semi-abstract approach aids him in arriving at his basic or archetypal statements. Confronting this work one feels as if vouchsafed an extraordinary elemental experience. Lawrence has grown in his use of rhythm as well as in sheer design and fluency.\nWorld War II.\nIn October 1943, during the Second World War, Lawrence was drafted into the United States Coast Guard and served as a public affairs specialist with the first racially integrated crew on the USCGC \"Sea Cloud\", under Carlton Skinner. He continued to paint and sketch while in the Coast Guard, documenting the experience of war around the world. He produced 48 paintings during this time, all of which have been lost. He achieved the rank of petty officer third class.\nLost works.\nIn October and November 1944, MoMA exhibited all 60 migration panels plus 8 of the paintings Lawrence created aboard the \"Sea Cloud\". He posed, still in his uniform, in front of a sign that read: \"Jacob Lawrence, The Migration Series and Works Created in the US Coast Guard\". The Coast Guard sent the eight paintings to exhibits around the United States. In the disorder and personnel changes that came with demobilization at the end of the war they went missing.\nPost-war.\nIn 1945, he was awarded a fellowship in the fine arts by the Guggenheim Foundation.\nIn 1946, Josef Albers recruited Lawrence to join the faculty of the summer art program at Black Mountain College.\nReturning to New York, Lawrence continued to paint but grew depressed; in 1949, he checked himself into Hillside Hospital in Queens, where he remained for eleven months. Painting there, he produced his Hospital Series: works that were uncharacteristic of him in their focus of his subjects' emotional states as inpatients.\nBetween 1954 and 1956 Lawrence produced a 30-panel series called \"Struggle: From the History of the American People\" that depicted historical scenes from 1775 to 1817. The series, originally planned to include sixty panels, ranges from references to current events like the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings and relatively obscure or neglected aspects of American history, like a woman, Margaret Cochran Corbin, in combat or the wall built by unseen enslaved Blacks that protected the American forces at the Battle of New Orleans. Rather than traditional titles, Lawrence labeled each panel with a quote. He titled a panel depicting Patrick Henry's famous speech with the less well-known passage: \"Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery.\" A panel depicting an African American slave revolt is titled with the words of a man who sued for emancipation from slavery in 1773: \"We have no property! We have no wives! No children! We have no city! No country!\" The fraught politics of the mid-1950s prevented the series from finding a museum purchaser, and the panels had been sold to a private collector who re-sold them as individual works. Three panels (Panels 14, 20 and 29) are lost, and three others were only located in 2017, 2020, and 2021. In 2021 the Peabody Essex Museum organized an exhibition all 30 of the panels including the newly discovered ones and reproductions of the works too fragile to travel or whose location is unknown.\nThe Brooklyn Museum of Art mounted a retrospective exhibition of Lawrence's work in 1960. In 1969, he was among 200 Black artists in a premier show sponsored by the Philadelphia School District and the Pennsylvania Civic Center Museum. The show featured some of the top names in the country, including Ellen Powell Tiberino, Horace Pippin, Nancy Elizabeth Prophet, Barbara Bullock, Jacob Lawrence, Benny Andrews, Roland Ayers, Romare Bearden, Avel de Knight, Barkley Hendricks, Paul Keene, Raymond Saunders, Louis B. Sloan, Ed Wilson, Henry Ossawa Tanner and Joshua Johnson.\nPublications.\nLawrence illustrated several works for children. \"Harriet and the Promised Land\" appeared in 1968 and used the series of paintings that told the story of Harriet Tubman. It was listed as one of the year's best illustrated books by \"The New York Times\" and praised by the \"Boston Globe\": \"The author's artistic talents, sensitivity and insight into the black experience have resulted in a book that actually creates, within the reader, a spiritual experience.\" Two similar volumes based on his John Brown and Great Migration series followed. Lawrence created illustrations for a selection of 18 of Aesop's Fables for Windmill Press in 1970, and the University of Washington Press published the full set of 23 tales in 1998.\nTeaching and late works.\nLawrence taught at several schools after his first stint teaching at Black Mountain College, including the New School for Social Research, the Art Students League, Pratt Institute, and the Skowhegan School. He became a visiting artist at the University of Washington in 1970 and was professor of art there from 1971 to 1986. He was graduate advisor there to lithographer and abstract painter James Claussen.\nShortly after moving to Washington state, Lawrence did a series of five paintings on the westward journey of African-American pioneer George Washington Bush. These paintings are now in the collection of the State of Washington History Museum.\nHe undertook several major commissions in this part of his career. In 1980, he completed \"Exploration\", a 40-foot-long mural made of porcelain on steel, comprising a dozen panels devoted to academic endeavor. It was installed in Howard University's Blackburn Center. The \"Washington Post\" described it as \"enormously sophisticated yet wholly unpretentious \" and said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The colors are completely flat, but because the porcelain is layered, and because Lawrence here and there paints in strong black shadows, his mural has the look of a rich relief. It is full of visual rhymes. The small scene of John Henry, the steel drivin' man, in the final panel is echoed by an image of a sculptor in the art scene: He is hammering another spike, for quite different reasons, into a block of stone. This is not art that one tires of, for it is not the sort of work one can read at once.\nLawrence produced another series in 1983, eight screen prints called the \"Hiroshima Series\". Commissioned to provide full-page illustrations for a new edition of a work of his choice, Lawrence chose John Hersey's \"Hiroshima\" (1946). He depicted in abstract visual language several survivors at the moment of the bombing in the midst of physical and emotional destruction.\nLawrence's painting \"Theater\" was commissioned by the University of Washington in 1985 and installed in the main lobby of the Meany Hall for the Performing Arts.\nIn the early 1990s Lawrence was commissioned to paint the \"Events in the Life of Harold Washington\" mural in Chicago's Harold Washington Library.\nLast years and death.\nThe Whitney Museum of American Art produced an exhibition of Lawrence's entire career in 1974, as did the Seattle Art Museum in 1986.\nIn 1999, he and his wife established the Jacob and Gwendolyn Lawrence Foundation for the creation, presentation and study of American art, with a particular emphasis on work by African-American artists. It represents their estates and maintains a searchable archive of nearly a thousand images of their work.\nLawrence continued to paint until a few weeks before his death from lung cancer on June 9, 2000, at the age of 82.\nPersonal life.\nLawrence's wife, Gwendolyn Knight, outlived him and died in 2005 at the age of 91.\nAwards and honors.\nThe eighteen institutions that awarded Lawrence honorary degrees include Harvard University, Yale University, Howard University, Amherst College, and New York University.\nLegacy.\n\"The New York Times\" described him as \"one of America's leading modern figurative painters\" and \"among the most impassioned visual chroniclers of the African-American experience.\" Shortly before his death he stated: \"...for me, a painting should have three things: universality, clarity and strength. Clarity and strength so that it may be aesthetically good. Universality so that it may be understood by all men.\"\nA retrospective exhibition of Lawrence's work, planned before his death, opened at the Phillips Collection in May 2001 and travelled to the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Detroit Institute of Fine Arts, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. The exhibit was meant to coincide with the publication of \"Jacob Lawrence: Paintings, Drawings, and Murals (1935-1999), A Catalogue Raisonne\". His last commissioned public work, the mosaic mural \"New York in Transit\" made of Murano glass was installed in October 2001 in the Times Square subway station in New York City.\nIn 2005, \"Dixie Caf\u00e9\", a 1948 brush-and-ink drawing by Lawrence, was selected to suggest The Civil Rights Act of 1964 in a U.S. postage stamp panel commemorating milestones of the Civil Rights Movement.

Known for his distinctive drawl and everyman screen persona, Stewart's film career spanned 80 films from 1935 to 1991. With the strong morality he portrayed both on and off the screen, he epitomized the \"American ideal\" in the mid-twentieth century. In 1999, the American Film Institute (AFI) ranked him third on its list of the greatest American male actors; he received numerous honors including the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1980, the Kennedy Center Honor in 1983, as well as the Academy Honorary Award and Presidential Medal of Freedom, both in 1985.\nBorn and raised in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Stewart started acting while at Princeton University. After graduating, he began a career as a stage actor making his Broadway debut in the play \"Carry Nation\" (1932). He landed his first supporting role in \"The Murder Man\" (1935) and had his breakthrough in Frank Capra's ensemble comedy \"You Can't Take It with You\" (1938). Stewart went on to receive the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in the George Cukor romantic comedy \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940). His other Oscar-nominated roles were in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939), \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946), \"Harvey\" (1950) and \"Anatomy of a Murder\" (1959).\nStewart played darker, more morally ambiguous characters in movies directed by Anthony Mann, including \"Winchester '73\" (1950), \"The Glenn Miller Story\" (1954), and \"The Naked Spur\" (1953), and by Alfred Hitchcock in \"Rope\" (1948), \"Rear Window\" (1954), \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" (1956), and \"Vertigo\" (1958). Stewart also starred in \"The Shop Around the Corner\" (1940), \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" (1952), \"The Spirit of St. Louis\" (1957), and \"The Flight of the Phoenix\" (1965) as well as the Western films \"How the West Was Won\" (1962), \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" (1962), and \"Cheyenne Autumn\" (1964).\nWith his private pilot's skills, he enlisted in the US Army Air Forces during World War II seeking combat duty and rose to be deputy commanding officer of the 2nd Bombardment Wing and commanding the 703d Bombardment Squadron from 1941 to 1947. He later transferred to the Air Force Reserve, and held various command positions until his retirement in 1968 as a brigadier general. Stewart remained unmarried until his 40s and was dubbed \"The Great American Bachelor\" by the press. In 1949, he married former model Gloria Hatrick McLean; they had twin daughters, and he adopted her two sons from her previous marriage; the marriage lasted until Gloria's death in 1994. Stewart died of a pulmonary embolism three years later.\nEarly life and education.\nJames Maitland Stewart was born on May 20, 1908, in Indiana, Pennsylvania, the eldest child and only son born to Elizabeth Ruth (n\u00e9e Jackson; 1875\u20131953) and Alexander Maitland Stewart (1872\u20131961). Stewart had two younger sisters, Mary (1912\u20131977) and Virginia (1914\u20131972). He was of Scottish and Ulster-Scots ancestry. The Stewart family had lived in Pennsylvania for many generations. Stewart's father ran the family business, the J. M. Stewart and Company Hardware Store, which he hoped Stewart would take over as an adult after attending Princeton University, as was the family tradition. Raised a Presbyterian by his deeply religious father, Stewart was a devout churchgoer for much of his life.\nStewart's mother was a pianist, and music was an important part of family life. When a customer at the store was unable to pay his bill, Stewart's father accepted an old accordion as payment. Stewart learned to play the instrument with the help of a local barber. His accordion became a fixture offstage during his acting career. A shy child, Stewart spent much of his time after school in the basement working on model airplanes, mechanical drawings, and chemistry\u2014all with a dream of going into aviation. He attended the Wilson Model School for primary school and junior high school. He was not a gifted student and received average to low grades. According to his teachers, this was not from a lack of intelligence, but due to being creative and having a tendency to daydream.\nStewart began attending Mercersburg Academy prep school in the fall of 1923, because his father did not believe he would be accepted into Princeton (his father was a member of the class of 1898) if he attended public high school. At Mercersburg, Stewart participated in a variety of extracurricular activities. He was a member of the track team (competing as a high jumper under coach Jimmy Curran), the art editor of the school yearbook, a member of the glee club, and a member of the John Marshall Literary Society. To his disappointment, he was relegated to the third-tier football team due to his slender physique. Stewart also made his first onstage appearance at Mercersburg, as Buquet in the play \"The Wolves\" in 1928. During summer breaks, he returned to Indiana, working first as a brick loader and then as a magician's assistant. Due to scarlet fever that turned into a kidney infection, he had to take time out from school in 1927, which delayed his graduation until 1928. He remained passionate about aviation, with his interest enhanced by Charles Lindbergh's first solo transatlantic flight, but abandoned visions of becoming a pilot when his father steered him towards Princeton.\nStewart enrolled at Princeton in 1928 as a member of the class of 1932, majoring in architecture and becoming a member of the Princeton Charter Club. He excelled academically but also became attracted to the school's drama and music clubs, including the Princeton Triangle Club. Upon his graduation in 1932, he was awarded a scholarship for graduate studies in architecture for his thesis on an airport terminal design, but chose instead to join University Players, an intercollegiate summer stock company performing in West Falmouth, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod.\nCareer.\n1932\u20131937: Theater and early film roles.\nStewart performed in bit parts in the University Players' productions in Cape Cod during the summer of 1932. The company's directors included Joshua Logan, Bretaigne Windust, and Charles Leatherbee, and amongst its other actors were married couple Henry Fonda and Margaret Sullavan, who became Stewart's close friends. At the end of the season, Stewart moved to New York with his Players friends Logan, Myron McCormick, and newly single Henry Fonda. Along with McCormick, Stewart debuted on Broadway in the brief run of \"Carry Nation\" and a few weeks later \u2013 again with McCormick \u2013 appeared as a chauffeur in the comedy \"Goodbye Again\", in which he had a walk-on line. \"The New Yorker\" commented, \"Mr. James Stewart's chauffeur... comes on for three minutes and walks off to a round of spontaneous applause.\" Following the seven-month run of \"Goodbye Again\", Stewart took a stage manager position in Boston, but was fired after frequently missing his cues. Returning to New York, he then landed a small part in \"Spring in Autumn\" and a role in \"All Good Americans\", where he was required to throw a banjo out of the window. Brooks Atkinson of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"Throwing a $250 banjo out of the window at the concierge is constructive abuse and should be virtuously applauded.\" Both plays folded after only short runs, and Stewart began to think about going back to his studies.\nStewart was convinced to continue acting when he was cast in the lead role of \"Yellow Jack\", playing a soldier who becomes the subject of a yellow fever experiment. It premiered at the Martin Beck Theater in March 1934. Stewart received unanimous praise from the critics, but the play proved unpopular with audiences and folded by June. During the summer, Stewart made his film debut with an unbilled appearance in the Shemp Howard comedy short \"Art Trouble\" (1934), filmed in Brooklyn, and acted in summer stock productions of \"We Die Exquisitely\" and \"All Paris Knows\" at the Red Barn Theater on Long Island. In the fall, he again received excellent reviews for his role in \"Divided by Three\" at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, which he followed with the modestly successful \"Page Miss Glory\" and the critical failure \"A Journey by Night\" in spring 1935.\nSoon after \"A Journey by Night\" ended, Stewart signed a seven-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), orchestrated by talent scout Bill Grady, who had been tracking Stewart's career since seeing him perform in Princeton. His first Hollywood role was a minor appearance in the Spencer Tracy vehicle \"The Murder Man\" (1935). His performance was largely ignored by critics, although the \"New York Herald Tribune\", remembering him in \"Yellow Jack\", called him \"wasted in a bit that he handles with characteristically engaging skill\". MGM did not see leading-man material in Stewart, described by biographer Michael D. Rinella as a \"lanky young bumpkin with a hesitant manner of speech\". During this time, his agent Leland Hayward decided that the best path for him would be through loan-outs to other studios.\nStewart had only a small role in his second MGM film, the hit musical \"Rose Marie\" (1936), but it led to his casting in seven other films within one year, including \"Next Time We Love\" and \"After the Thin Man\". He also received crucial help from his University Players friend Margaret Sullavan, who campaigned for him to be her leading man in \"Next Time We Love\", a Universal romantic comedy filmed right after \"Rose Marie\". Sullavan rehearsed extensively with him, boosting his confidence and helping him incorporate his mannerisms and boyishness into his screen persona. \"Next Time We Love\" was a box-office success and received mostly positive reviews, leading Stewart to be noticed by critics and MGM executives. \"Time\" stated that \"the chief significance of [the film]\u00a0in the progress of the cinema industry is likely to reside in the presence in its cast of James Stewart\", and \"The New York Times\" called him \"a welcome addition to the roster of Hollywood's leading men\".\nStewart followed \"Next Time We Love\" with supporting roles in two commercially successful romantic comedies, \"Wife vs. Secretary\" (1936) with Clark Gable and Myrna Loy and \"Small Town Girl\" (1936). In both, he played the betrayed boyfriend of the leading lady, portrayed by Jean Harlow and Janet Gaynor, respectively. Both films garnered him some good reviews. After an appearance in the short subject \"Important News\" (1936), Stewart had his first top-billed role in the low-budget \"B\" movie \"Speed\" (1936), in which he played a mechanic and speed driver\u00a0competing in the Indianapolis 500. The film was a critical and commercial failure, although Frank Nugent of \"The New York Times\" stated that \"Mr. Stewart [and the rest of the cast] perform as pleasantly as possible.\"\nStewart's last three film releases of 1936 were all box-office successes. He had only a bit part in \"The Gorgeous Hussy\", but a starring role in the musical \"Born to Dance\" with Eleanor Powell. His performance in the latter was not well-received: \"The New York Times\" stated that his \"singing and dancing will (fortunately) never win him a song-and-dance-man classification\", and \"Variety\" called \"his singing and dancing [...] rather painful on their own\", although it otherwise found Stewart aptly cast in an \"assignment [that] calls for a shy youth\". Stewart's last film to be released in 1936, \"After the Thin Man\", features a shattering emotional climax rendered by Stewart. Kate Cameron of the \"New York Daily News\" wrote that he \"has one grand scene in which he demonstrates most effectively that he is something more than a musical comedy juvenile\".\nFor his next film, the romantic drama \"Seventh Heaven\" (1937), Stewart was loaned to 20th Century-Fox to play a Parisian sewer worker in a remake of Frank Borzage's silent classic released a decade earlier. He and co-star Simone Simon were miscast, and the film was a critical and commercial failure. William Boehnel of the \"New York World-Telegram\" called Stewart's performance emotionless, and Eileen Creelman of \"The New York Sun\" wrote that he made little attempt to look or sound French. Stewart's next film, \"The Last Gangster\" (1937) starring Edward G. Robinson, was also a failure, but it was followed by a critically acclaimed performance in \"Navy Blue and Gold\" (1937) as a football player at the United States Naval Academy. The film was a box-office success and earned Stewart the best reviews of his career up to that point. \"The New York Times\" wrote \"the ending leaves us with the conviction that James Stewart is a sincere and likable triple-threat man in the [MGM] backfield\" and \"Variety\" called his performance \"fine\".\n1938\u20131941: Leading man.\nDespite good reviews, Stewart was still a minor star, and MGM remained hesitant to cast him in leading roles, preferring to loan him out to other studios. After a well-received supporting part in \"Of Human Hearts\" (1938), he was loaned to RKO to act opposite Ginger Rogers in the romantic comedy \"Vivacious Lady\" (1938). The production was shut down for months in 1937 as Stewart recovered from an undisclosed illness, during which he was hospitalized. RKO initially wanted to replace Stewart, but eventually the project was canceled. However, Rogers' success in a stage musical caused the film to be picked up again. Stewart was recast in \"Vivacious Lady\" at Rogers' insistence and due to his performance in \"Of Human Hearts\". It was a critical and commercial success, and showed Stewart's talent for performing in romantic comedies; \"The New York Herald\" called him \"one of the most knowing and engaging young actors appearing on the screen at present\".\nStewart's third film release of 1938, the First World War\u00a0drama \"The Shopworn Angel\", saw him collaborate again with Margaret Sullavan. In his performance, Stewart drew upon his own feelings of unrequited love towards Sullavan, who was married to his agent, Leland Hayward. Although the film was otherwise well-received, critics were mixed about Stewart. Bland Johaneson of the \"New York Daily Mirror\" compared him to Stan Laurel in this melodramatic film, and \"Variety\" called his performance unfocused.\nStewart became a major star when he was loaned out to Columbia Pictures to play the lead role in Frank Capra's \"You Can't Take It with You\" (1938) opposite Jean Arthur. Stewart played the son of a banker who falls in love with a woman from a poor and eccentric family. Capra had recently completed several well-received films and was looking for a new type of leading man. He had been impressed by Stewart's role in \"Navy Blue and Gold\" (1937). According to Capra, Stewart was one of the best actors ever to hit the screen, understood character archetypes intuitively, and required little directing. \"You Can't Take It With You\" became the fifth highest-grossing film of the year and won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The film was also critically successful, but while \"Variety\" wrote that the performances of Stewart and Arthur garnered \"much of the laughs\", most of the critical acclaim went to Lionel Barrymore and Edward Arnold.\nIn contrast to the success of \"You Can't Take It With You\", Stewart's first three film releases of 1939 were all commercial disappointments. In the melodrama \"Made for Each Other\" (1939), he shared the screen with Carole Lombard. Stewart blamed its directing and screenwriting for its poor box-office performance. Regardless, the film received favorable reviews, with \"Newsweek\" writing that Stewart and Lombard were \"perfectly cast in the leading roles\". The other two films, \"The Ice Follies of 1939\" and \"It's a Wonderful World\", were critical failures.\nIn Stewart's fourth 1939 film, he worked with Capra and Arthur again in the political comedy-drama \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\". Stewart played an idealist thrown into the political arena. It garnered critical praise and became the third-highest-grossing film of the year. \"The Nation\" stated \"[Stewart] takes first place among Hollywood actors...Now he is mature and gives a difficult part, with many nuances, moments of tragic-comic impact.\" Later, critic Andrew Sarris qualified Stewart's performance as \"lean, gangling, idealistic to the point of being neurotic, thoughtful to the point of being tongue-tied\", describing him as \"particularly gifted in expressing the emotional ambivalence of the action hero\". Stewart won the New York Film Critics Circle award and received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.\nStewart's last screen appearance of 1939 came in the Western \"Destry Rides Again\", in which he portrayed a pacifist lawman alongside Marlene Dietrich, a saloon girl who falls in love with him. It was critically and commercially successful. \"TIME\" magazine wrote, \"James Stewart, who had just turned in the top performance of his cinematurity as Jefferson Smith in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", turns in as good a performance or better as Thomas Jefferson Destry.\" Between films, Stewart had begun a radio career and had become a distinctive voice on the \"Lux Radio Theater\", \"The Screen Guild Theater\", and other shows. So well-known had his slow drawl become that comedians began impersonating him.\nStewart and Sullavan reunited for two films in 1940. The Ernst Lubitsch romantic comedy \"The Shop Around the Corner\" starred them as co-workers who cannot stand each other but unknowingly become romantic pen-pals. It received good reviews and was a box-office success in Europe, but failed to find an audience in the US, where less-gentle screwball comedies were more popular. Director Lubitsch assessed it to be the best film of his career, and it has been regarded highly by later critics, such as Pauline Kael and Richard Schickel.\nThe drama \"The Mortal Storm\", directed by Frank Borzage, featured Sullavan and Stewart as lovers caught in turmoil upon Hitler's rise to power. It was one of the first blatantly anti-Nazi films to be produced in Hollywood, but according to film scholar Ben Urwand, \"ultimately made very little impact\" as it did not show the persecution experienced by Jews or name that ethnic group. Despite being well received by critics, it failed at the box office. Ten days after filming \"The Mortal Storm\", Stewart began filming \"No Time for Comedy\" (1940) with Rosalind Russell. Critics complimented Stewart's performance; Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" called Stewart \"the best thing in the show\", yet the film was again not a box-office success.\nStewart's final film to be released in 1940 was George Cukor's romantic comedy \"The Philadelphia Story\", in which he played an intrusive, fast-talking reporter sent to cover the wedding of a socialite (Katharine Hepburn) with the help of her ex-husband (Cary Grant). The film became one of the largest box-office successes of the year and received widespread critical acclaim. \"The New York Herald Tribune\" stated that \"Stewart...contributes most of the comedy to the show...In addition, he contributes some of the most irresistible romantic moments.\" His performance earned him his only Academy Award in a competitive category for Best Actor, beating out Henry Fonda, for whom he had voted and with whom he had once roomed, both almost broke, in the early 1930s in New York. Stewart himself assessed his performance in \"Mr. Smith\" to be superior and believed the academy was recompensing for not giving him the award the year prior. Moreover, Stewart's character was a supporting role, not the male lead. He gave the Oscar to his father, who displayed it at his hardware store alongside other family awards and military medals.\nStewart next appeared in two comedies\u2014\"Come Live with Me\" (1941), which paired him with Hedy Lamarr, and \"Pot o' Gold\" (1941), featuring Paulette Goddard\u2014that were both box-office failures. Stewart considered the latter to be the worst film of his career. His last film before military service was the musical \"Ziegfeld Girl\" (1941), which co-starred Judy Garland, Hedy Lamarr, and Lana Turner. It was a critical failure, but also one of the best box-office performers of the year.\n1941\u20131947: Military service.\nStewart became the first major American movie star to enlist in the United States Army to fight in World War II. His family had deep military roots: both of his grandfathers had fought in the Civil War, and his father had served during both the Spanish\u2013American War and World War I. After first being rejected for low weight in November 1940, he enlisted in February 1941. As an experienced pilot, he reported for induction as a private in the Air Corps on March 22, 1941. Soon to be 33 years old, he was over the age limit for Aviation Cadet training\u2014the normal path of commissioning for pilots, navigators and bombardiers\u2014and therefore applied for an Air Corps commission as both a college graduate and a licensed commercial pilot. Stewart received his commission as a second lieutenant on January 1, 1942.\nAfter enlisting, Stewart made no new commercial films, although he remained under contract to MGM. His public appearances were limited to engagements for the Army Air Forces. The Air Corps scheduled him on network radio with Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, and on the radio program \"We Hold These Truths\", a celebration of the United States Bill of Rights, which was broadcast a week after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Stewart also appeared in a First Motion Picture Unit short film, \"Winning Your Wings\", to help recruit airmen. Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1942, it appeared in movie theaters nationwide beginning in late May 1942 and resulted in 150,000 new recruits.\nStewart was concerned that his celebrity status would relegate him to duties behind the lines. After spending over a year training pilots at Kirtland Army Airfield in Albuquerque, New Mexico, he appealed to his commander and in November 1943 was sent to England as part of the 703d Bomb Squadron to fly B-24 Liberators. He was based initially at RAF Tibenham, before moving to RAF Old Buckenham.\nStewart was promoted to major following a mission to Ludwigshafen, Germany, on January 7, 1944. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for actions as deputy commander of the 2nd Bombardment Wing, the French Croix de Guerre with palm, and the Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters. Stewart was promoted to full colonel on March 29, 1945, becoming one of the few Americans to ever rise from private to colonel in only four years. At the beginning of June 1945, Stewart was the presiding officer of the court martial of a pilot and navigator who accidentally bombed Zurich, Switzerland.\nStewart returned to the United States in early fall 1945. He continued to play a role in reserve of the Army after the war and was also one of the 12 founders of the Air Force Association in October 1945. Stewart eventually transferred to the reserves of the United States Air Force after the Army Air Forces split from the Army in 1947. During active-duty periods, he served with the Strategic Air Command and completed transition training as a pilot on the B-47 and B-52.\nStewart was first nominated for promotion to brigadier general in February 1957; however, his promotion was initially opposed by Senator Margaret Chase Smith. At the time of the nomination, the \"Washington Daily News\" noted: \"He trains actively with the Reserve every year. He's had 18 hours as first pilot of a B-52.\" On July 23, 1959, Stewart was promoted to brigadier general, becoming the highest-ranking actor in American military history. During the Vietnam War, he flew as a non-duty observer in a B-52 on an Arc Light bombing mission in February 1966. He served for 27 years, officially retiring from the Air Force on May 31, 1968, when he reached the mandatory retirement age of 60. Upon his retirement, he was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal. Stewart rarely spoke about his wartime service but did appear in an episode of the British television documentary series \"The World at War\" (1974), commenting on the disastrous 1943 mission against Schweinfurt, Germany.\n1946\u20131949: Early post-war films.\nAfter his experiences in the war, Stewart considered returning to Pennsylvania to run the family store. His former agent, Leland Hayward, had also left the talent business in 1944 after selling his roster of stars, including Stewart, to Music Corporation of America (MCA). Stewart decided not to renew his MGM contract and instead signed a deal with MCA. He later stated that he was given a new beginning by Frank Capra, who asked him to star in \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946), the first postwar film for both of them. Stewart played George Bailey, an upstanding small-town man who becomes increasingly frustrated by his ordinary existence and financial troubles. Driven to suicide on Christmas Eve, he is led to reassess his life by Clarence Odbody, an \"angel, second class\", played by Henry Travers. During filming, Stewart experienced doubts about his abilities and continued to consider retiring from acting.\nAlthough \"It's a Wonderful Life\" was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Stewart's third Best Actor nomination, it received mixed reviews and was only a moderate success at the box office, failing to cover its production costs. Several critics found the movie too sentimental, although Bosley Crowther wrote that Stewart did a \"warmly appealing job, indicating that he has grown in spiritual stature as well as in talent during the years he was in the war\", and President Harry S. Truman concluded that \"If [my wife] and I had a son we'd want him to be just like Jimmy Stewart [in this film].\" In the decades since its release, \"It's a Wonderful Life\" has grown to define Stewart's film persona and is widely considered a Christmas classic, and according to the American Film Institute, is one of the 100 best American movies ever made. Andrew Sarris stated that Stewart's performance was underappreciated by critics of the time, who could not see \"the force and fury\" of it, and considered his proposal scene with Donna Reed, \"one of the most sublimely histrionic expressions of passion\". Stewart later named the film his personal favorite out of his filmography.\nIn the aftermath of \"It's A Wonderful Life\", Capra's production company went into bankruptcy, while Stewart continued to have doubts about his acting abilities. His generation of actors was fading, and a new wave of actors, including Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, and James Dean, would soon remake Hollywood. Stewart returned to making radio dramas in 1946; he continued this work between films until the mid-1950s. He also made a comeback on Broadway to star in Mary Coyle Chase's \"Harvey\" in July 1947, replacing the original star Frank Fay for the duration of his vacation. The play had opened to nearly universal praise in 1944 and told the story of Elwood P. Dowd, a wealthy eccentric, whose best friend is an invisible man-sized rabbit and whose relatives are trying to get him committed to a mental asylum. Stewart gained a following in the unconventional play, and although Fay returned to the role in August, they decided that Stewart would take his place again the next summer. Stewart's only film to be released in 1947 was the William A. Wellman comedy \"Magic Town\", one of the first films about the new science of public opinion polling. It was poorly received both commercially and critically.\nStewart appeared in four new film releases in 1948. \"Call Northside 777\" was a critically acclaimed film noir, while the musical comedy \"On Our Merry Way\", in which Stewart and Henry Fonda played jazz musicians in an ensemble cast, was a critical and commercial failure. The comedy \"You Gotta Stay Happy\", which paired Stewart with Joan Fontaine, was the most successful of his post-war films up to that point. \"Rope\", in which Stewart played the idolized teacher of two young men who commit murder to show their supposed superiority, began his collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock. Shot in long \"real-time\" takes, Stewart felt pressure to be flawless in his performance; the added stress led to him sleeping very little and drinking more heavily. \"Rope\" received mixed reviews, and Andrew Sarris and Scott Eyman have later called him miscast in the role of a Nietzsche-loving philosophy professor. The film's screenwriter Arthur Laurents also stated that \"the casting of [Stewart] was absolutely destructive. He's not sexual as an actor.\"\nStewart found success again with \"The Stratton Story\" (1949), playing baseball champion Monty Stratton\u00a0opposite June Allyson. It became the sixth highest-grossing film of 1949 and was well received by the critics. \"The New York Times\" noted, \"\"The Stratton Story\" was the best thing that has yet happened to Mr. Stewart in his post-war film career...he gives such a winning performance that it is almost impossible to imagine any one else playing the role.\" Stewart's other 1949 release saw him reunited with Spencer Tracy in the World War II film \"Malaya\" (1949). It was a commercial failure and received mixed reviews.\n1950\u20131959: Collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Mann.\nIn the 1950s, Stewart experienced a career renewal as the star of Westerns and collaborated on several films with director Anthony Mann. The first of these was the Universal production \"Winchester '73\" (1950), which Stewart agreed to do in exchange for being cast in a screen adaptation of \"Harvey\". It also marked a turning point in Hollywood, as Stewart's agent, Lew Wasserman, brokered an innovative deal with Universal, in which Stewart would receive no fee in exchange for a percentage of the profits. Stewart was also granted authority to collaborate with the studio on casting and hiring decisions. Stewart ended up earning about $600,000 for \"Winchester '73\", significantly more than his usual fee, and other stars quickly capitalized on this new way of doing business, which further undermined the decaying studio system.\nStewart chose Mann to direct, and the film gave him the idea of redefining his screen persona through the Western genre. In the film, Stewart is a tough, vengeful sharpshooter, the winner of a prized rifle that is stolen and passes through many hands, until the showdown between him and his brother. \"Winchester '73\" became a box-office success upon its summer release and earned Stewart rave reviews. He also starred in another successful Western that summer, \"Broken Arrow\" (1950), which featured him as an ex-soldier and Native American agent making peace with the Apache.\nStewart's third film release of 1950 was the comedy \"The Jackpot\"; it received critical acclaim and was commercially successful, but was a minor film in his repertoire and has largely been forgotten by contemporary critics and fans. In December 1950, the screen adaptation of \"Harvey\" was released, directed by Henry Koster and with Stewart reprising his stage role. With critics comparing his performance with Fay's, Stewart's performance as well as the film itself received mixed reviews. Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"so darling is the acting of James Stewart [...] and all the rest that a virtually brand-new experience is still in store for even those who saw the play\", while \"Variety\" called him \"perfect\" in the role. John McCarten of the \"New Yorker\" stated that although he \"doesn't bring his part to the battered authority of Frank Fay...he nevertheless succeeds in making plausible the notion that Harvey, the rabbit, would accept him as a pal.\" Stewart later stated that he was dissatisfied with his performance, stating, \"I played him a little too dreamily, a little too cute-cute.\" Despite the film's poor box office performance, Stewart received his fourth Academy Award nomination as well as his first Golden Globe nomination. Similar to \"It's a Wonderful Life\", \"Harvey\" achieved popularity later, after frequent television showings.\nStewart appeared in only one film released in 1951, playing a scientist in Koster's British production \"No Highway in the Sky\", which was one of the first airplane disaster films ever made. Filmed in England, it became a box office success in the United Kingdom, but failed to attract audiences in the United States. Stewart took a small supporting role as a troubled clown in Cecil B. DeMille's \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" (1952), which went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Critics were curious why Stewart had taken such a small, out-of-character role; he responded that he was inspired by Lon Chaney's ability to disguise himself while letting his character emerge. In the same year, Stewart starred in a critically and commercially failed biopic, \"Carbine Williams\" (1952), and continued his collaboration with Mann in \"Bend of the River\" (1952), which was a commercial and critical success.Stewart followed \"Bend of the River\" with four more collaborations with Mann in the next two years. \"The Naked Spur\" (1953) and \"The Far Country\" (1954) were successful with audiences and developed Stewart's screen persona into a more mature, ambiguous, and edgier presence. The films featured him as troubled cowboys seeking redemption while facing corrupt cattlemen, ranchers, and outlaws; a man who knows violence first-hand and struggles to control it. The Stewart\u2013Mann collaborations laid the foundation for many of the Westerns of the 1950s and remain popular today for their grittier, more realistic depiction of the classic movie genre. In addition, Stewart starred in the Western radio show \"The Six Shooter\" for its one-season run from 1953 to 1954. He and Mann also collaborated on films outside the Western genre such as \"Thunder Bay\" (1953) and \"The Glenn Miller Story\" (1954), the latter a critically acclaimed biopic in which he starred opposite June Allyson. It earned Stewart a BAFTA nomination and continued his portrayals of 'American heroes'.\nStewart's second collaboration with Hitchcock, the thriller \"Rear Window\", became the eighth highest-grossing film of 1954. Hitchcock and Stewart also formed a corporation, Patron Inc., to produce the film. Stewart portrayed a photographer, loosely based on Robert Capa, who projects his fantasies and fears onto the people he observes out his apartment window while on hiatus due to a broken leg and comes to believe that he has witnessed a murder. Limited by his wheelchair, Stewart had to react to what his character sees with mostly facial responses. Like Mann, Hitchcock uncovered new depths to Stewart's acting, showing a protagonist confronting his fears and repressed desires. Although most of the initial acclaim for \"Rear Window\" was directed towards Hitchcock, critic Vincent Canby later described Stewart's performance in it as \"grand\" and stated that \"[his] longtime star status in Hollywood has always obscured recognition of his talent.\" 1954 was a landmark year in Stewart's career in terms of audience success, and he topped \"Look\" magazine's list of the most-popular movie stars, displacing rival Western star John Wayne.\nStewart continued his successful box-office run with two collaborations with Mann in 1955. \"Strategic Air Command\" paired him again with June Allyson in a film focusing on the Cold War. Stewart took a central role in its development, using his experiences from the air force. Despite criticism for the dry, mechanistic storyline, it became the sixth highest-grossing film of 1955. Stewart's final collaboration with Mann in the Western genre, \"The Man from Laramie\", one of the first Westerns to be shot in CinemaScope, was well received by the critics and audiences alike. Following his work with Mann, Stewart starred opposite Doris Day in Hitchcock's remake of his earlier film \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" (1956). The film was another success. Even though critics preferred the first version, Hitchcock himself considered his remake superior.\nStewart's next film, Billy Wilder's \"The Spirit of St. Louis\" (1957), saw him star as his young adulthood hero, Charles Lindbergh. It was a big-budget production with elaborate special effects for the flying sequences, but received only mixed reviews and did not earn back its production costs. Stewart ended the year with a starring role in the Western \"Night Passage\" (1957), which had originally been slated as his ninth collaboration with Mann. During the pre-production, a rift developed between Mann and writer Borden Chase over the script, which Mann considered weak. Mann decided to leave the film and never collaborated with Stewart again. James Neilson replaced Mann, and the film opened in 1957 to become a box-office flop. Soured by this failure, Stewart avoided the genre and would not make another Western for four years.\nStewart's collaboration with Hitchcock ended the following year with \"Vertigo\" (1958), in which he starred as an acrophobic former policeman who becomes obsessed with a woman (Kim Novak) he is shadowing. Although \"Vertigo\" has later become considered one of Hitchcock's key works and was ranked the greatest film ever made by the \"Sight &amp; Sound\" critics' poll in 2012, it was met with unenthusiastic reviews and poor box-office receipts upon its release. Regardless, several critics complimented Stewart for his performance, with Bosley Crowther noting, \"Mr. Stewart, as usual, manages to act awfully tense in a casual way.\"\nHitchcock blamed the film's failure on Stewart being too old to convincingly be Novak's love interest: he was fifty years old at the time and had begun wearing a silver hairpiece in his movies. Consequently, Hitchcock cast Cary Grant in his next film, \"North by Northwest\" (1959), a role Stewart wanted; Grant was four years older than Stewart but photographed much younger. Stewart's second 1958 film release, the romantic comedy \"Bell, Book and Candle\" (1958), also paired him with Kim Novak, with Stewart later echoing Hitchcock in saying that he was miscast as 25-year-old Novak's romantic partner. The film and Stewart's performance received poor reviews and resulted in a box office failure. However, according to film scholar David Bingham, by the early 1950s, \"Stewart's personality was so credible and well-established\", that his choice of role no longer affected his popularity.\nStewart ended the decade with Otto Preminger's realistic courtroom drama \"Anatomy of a Murder\" (1959) and the crime film \"The FBI Story\" (1959). The former was a box office success despite its explicit dealing with subjects such as rape, and garnered good reviews. Stewart received critical acclaim for his role as a small-town lawyer involved in a difficult murder case; Bosley Crowther called it \"one of the finest performances of his career\". Stewart won his first BAFTA, a Volpi Cup, a New York Film Critics Circle Award, and a Producers Guild of America Award, as well as earned his fifth and final Academy Award nomination for his performance. \"The FBI Story\", in which Stewart portrayed a Depression-era FBI agent, was less well received by critics and was commercially unsuccessful. Despite its commercial failure, the film marked the close of the most commercially successful decade of Stewart's career. According to Quigley's annual poll, Stewart was one of the top money-making stars for ten years, appearing in the top ten in 1950, 1952\u20131959, and 1965. He topped the list in 1955.\n1960\u20131970: Westerns and later career.\nStewart opened the new decade by starring in the war film \"The Mountain Road\" (1960). To his surprise, it was a box office failure, despite his claims that it was one of the best scripts he'd ever read. He began a new director collaboration with John Ford, making his debut in his films in the Western \"Two Rode Together\" (1961), which had thematic echoes of Ford's \"The Searchers\". The same year, he also narrated the film \"X-15\" for the USAF. Stewart was considered for the role of Atticus Finch in the 1962 film adaptation of Harper Lee's novel \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", but he turned it down, concerned that the story was too controversial.\nStewart and Ford's next collaboration was \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" (1962). A classic psychological Western, the picture was shot in black-and-white film noir style at Ford's insistence, with Stewart as an East Coast attorney who goes against his non-violent principles when he is forced to confront a psychopathic outlaw (Lee Marvin) in a small frontier town. The complex film initially garnered mixed reviews but became a critical favorite over the ensuing decades. Stewart was billed above John Wayne in posters and the trailers, but Wayne received top billing in the film itself. Stewart, Wayne, and Ford also collaborated for a television play that same year, \"Flashing Spikes\" (1962), for ABC's anthology series \"Alcoa Premiere\", albeit featuring Wayne billed with a television pseudonym, \"Michael Morris\", (also used for Wayne's brief appearance in the John Ford-directed episode of the television series \"Wagon Train\" titled \"The Colter Craven Story\") for his lengthy cameo. Next, Stewart appeared as part of an all-star cast\u2014including Henry Fonda and John Wayne\u2014in \"How the West Was Won\", a Western epic released in the United States in early 1963. The film went on to win three Academy Awards and reap massive box-office figures.\nIn 1962, Stewart signed a multi-movie deal with 20th Century Fox. The first two of these films reunited him with director Henry Koster in the family-friendly comedies \"Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation\" (1962) with Maureen O'Hara and \"Take Her, She's Mine\" (1963), which were both box-office successes. The former received moderately positive reviews and won Stewart the Silver Bear for Best Actor\u00a0at the Berlin International Film Festival; the latter was panned by the critics. Stewart then appeared in John Ford's final Western, \"Cheyenne Autumn\" (1964), playing a white-suited Wyatt Earp in a long semi-comedic sequence in the middle of the movie. The film failed domestically and was quickly forgotten.\nIn 1965, Stewart was given his first honorary award for his career, the Cecil B. DeMille Award. He appeared in three films that year. The Fox family-comedy \"Dear Brigitte\" (1965), which featured French actress Brigitte Bardot as the object of Stewart's son's infatuation, was a box-office failure. The Civil War film \"Shenandoah\" (1965) was a commercial success with strong anti-war and humanitarian themes. \"The Flight of the Phoenix\" (1965) continued Stewart's series of aviation-themed films; it was well-received critically, but a box-office failure.\nFor the next few years, Stewart acted in a series of Westerns: \"The Rare Breed\" (1966) with Maureen O'Hara, \"Firecreek\" (1968) with Henry Fonda, \"Bandolero!\" (1968) with Dean Martin, and \"The Cheyenne Social Club\" (1970) with Henry Fonda again. In 1968, he received the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award.\u00a0Stewart returned on Broadway to reprise his role as Elwood P. Dowd in \"Harvey\" at the ANTA Theatre in February 1970; the revival ran until May. He won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance\u00a0for it.\n1971\u20131997: Television and semi-retirement.\nIn 1971, Stewart starred in the NBC sitcom \"The Jimmy Stewart Show\". He played a small-town college professor whose adult son moves back home with his family. Stewart disliked the amount of work needed to film the show each week and was relieved when it was canceled after only one season due to bad reviews and poor ratings. His only film release for 1971, the comedy-drama \"Fools' Parade\", was more positively received. Robert Greenspun of \"The New York Times\" stated that \"the movie belongs to Stewart, who has never been more wonderful\". For his contributions to Western films, Stewart was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City in 1972.\nStewart returned to television in \"Harvey\" for NBC's Hallmark Hall of Fame series in 1972 and then starred in the CBS mystery series \"Hawkins\" in 1973. Playing a small-town lawyer investigating mysterious cases\u2014similar to his character in \"Anatomy of a Murder\"\u2014Stewart won a Golden Globe for his performance. Nevertheless, \"Hawkins\" failed to gain a wide audience, possibly because it rotated with \"Shaft\", which had a starkly conflicting demographic, and was canceled after one season. Stewart also periodically appeared on Johnny Carson's \"The Tonight Show\", sharing poems he had written at different times in his life. His poems were later compiled into a short collection, \"Jimmy Stewart and His Poems\" (1989).\nAfter performing again in \"Harvey\" at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London in 1975, Stewart returned to films with a major supporting role in John Wayne's final film, \"The Shootist\" (1976), playing a doctor giving Wayne's gunfighter a terminal cancer diagnosis. By this time, Stewart had a hearing impairment, which affected his ability to hear his cues and led to him repeatedly flubbing his lines; his vanity would not allow him to admit this or to wear a hearing aid. Stewart was offered the role of Howard Beale in \"Network\" (1976) but refused it due to its explicit language. Instead, he appeared in supporting roles in the disaster film \"Airport '77\" (1977) with Jack Lemmon, the remake of \"The Big Sleep\" (1978) with Robert Mitchum as Philip Marlowe, and the family film \"The Magic of Lassie\" (1978). Despite mixed reviews, \"Airport '77\" was a box-office success, but the two other films were commercial and critical failures. Harry Haun of \"New York Daily News\" wrote in his review of \"The Big Sleep\" that it was \"really sad to see James Stewart struggle so earnestly with material that just isn't there\". Stewart made a memorable cameo appearance on the final episode of \"The Carol Burnett Show\" in March 1978, surprising Burnett, a lifelong Stewart fan.\nStewart's final live-action feature film was the critically panned Japanese film \"The Green Horizon\" (1980), directed by Susumu Hani. Stewart took the role because the film promoted wildlife conservation and allowed his family to travel with him to Kenya. In the 1980s, Stewart semi-retired from acting. He was offered the role of Norman Thayer in \"On Golden Pond\" (1981) but turned it down because he disliked the film's father-daughter relationship; the role went instead to his friend, Henry Fonda. Stewart filmed two television movies in the 1980s: \"Mr. Krueger's Christmas\" (1980), produced by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which allowed him to fulfill a lifelong dream to conduct the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and \"Right of Way\" (1983), an HBO drama that co-starred Bette Davis. He also made an appearance in the historical miniseries \"North and South\" in 1986 and did voiceover work for commercials for Campbell's Soups in the 1980s and 1990s. Stewart's last film performance was voicing the character of Sheriff Wylie Burp in the animated movie \"\" (1991).\nStewart remained in the public eye due to his frequent visits to the White House during the Reagan administration. The re-release of Hitchcock films gained him renewed recognition, with \"Rear Window\" and \"Vertigo\" praised by film critics. Stewart also received several honorary film industry awards at the end of his career: an American Film Institute Award in 1980, a Silver Bear in 1982, Kennedy Center Honors in 1983, an Academy Honorary Award in 1985, and National Board of Review\u00a0and Film Society of Lincoln Center's Chaplin Award in 1990. The honorary Oscar was presented by former co-star Cary Grant \"for his 50 years of memorable performances, for his high ideals both on and off the screen, with respect and affection of his colleagues\". In addition, Stewart received the highest civilian award in the US, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, \"for his contributions in the fields of the arts, entertainment and public service\", in 1985.\nAI imitation.\nIn December 2023, meditation app Calm announced that Stewart would be the latest narrator for its Sleep Story series, with an AI-generated voice of the actor reading an original story \"It's a Wonderful Sleep Story\". The project uses AI voice-cloning technology from Respeecher, and was conducted with the consent of Stewart's family and his estate.\nPersonal life.\nRomantic relationships.\nAs a friend, mentor, and focus of his early romantic feelings, Margaret Sullavan had a unique influence on Stewart's life. They met while they were both performing for the University Players; he was smitten, and invited her on a date. However, she regarded him as a close friend and co-worker, so they never began a romantic relationship. Though Sullavan was always aware of his feelings, Stewart never directly revealed them. Sullavan loved Stewart, but not romantically. Rather, she felt protective and maternal towards him.\nThe director of \"The Shopworn Angel\", H. C. Potter, suggested they might have married had Stewart been more forthcoming with his feelings. Instead, Sullavan became his acting mentor in Hollywood. According to director Edward H. Griffith, she \"made [him] a star\" by co-starring with him in four films: \"Next Time You Love\" (1936), \"The Shopworn Angel\" (1938), \"The Shop Around the Corner\" (1940) and \"The Mortal Storm\" (1940).\nStewart did not marry until his forties, which attracted a significant amount of contemporary media attention; gossip columnist Hedda Hopper called him the \"Great American Bachelor\". He had several romantic relationships prior to marriage. After being introduced by Henry Fonda, Stewart and Ginger Rogers enjoyed a relationship in 1935, while Fonda was dating Rogers' good friend Lucille Ball.\nDuring production of \"The Shopworn Angel\" (1938), Stewart dated actress Norma Shearer for six weeks. Afterward, he dated Loretta Young, but she wanted to settle down and Stewart did not.\nWhile filming \"Destry Rides Again\" (1939), Stewart had an affair with his co-star Marlene Dietrich, who was married at the time. Dietrich allegedly became pregnant, but it was quickly terminated. Stewart ended their relationship after the filming was completed. Hurt by Stewart's rejection, she barely mentioned him in her memoir and waved him off as a one-time affair.\nHe dated Olivia de Havilland in the late 1930s and early 1940s and even proposed marriage to her, but she rejected the proposal, as she believed he was not ready to settle down. She ended the relationship shortly before he began his military service, as she had fallen in love with director John Huston.\nWar career as pilot (1941\u20131946).\nA licensed civilian pilot, Stewart enlisted in the US Army Air Forces early in 1941, undertaking military flight training and becoming a commissioned officer and USAAF pilot. In January 1944 in the rank of captain, he was assigned to the 453rd Bombardment Group, 2nd Combat Bombardment Wing, Eighth Air Force operating out of East Anglia, England as a bomber pilot flying the B-24 Liberator. After seeing action in Europe during World War II, he attained the rank of colonel and received several awards for his service. He remained in the Army Air Forces Reserve after the end of World War II, which would become the Air Force Reserve when the US Air Force became an independent service in 1947. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the Air Force Reserve in 1959. He retired from the service in 1968, at which time he was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal. President Reagan recounted at a White House briefing that he was corrected by Stewart himself after Reagan incorrectly announced he was a major general at a campaign event.\nMarriage and family.\nIn 1942, while serving in the military, Stewart met singer Dinah Shore at the Hollywood Canteen, a club mainly for servicemen. They began a romantic relationship and were nearly married in Las Vegas in 1943, but Stewart called off the marriage before they arrived, citing cold feet. After the war, Stewart began a relationship with Myrna Dell while he was filming \"The Stratton Story\" (1949). Although gossip columnists made claims that they were planning to marry, Dell said this was not true.\nStewart's first interaction with his future wife, Gloria Hatrick McLean, was at Keenan Wynn's Christmas party in 1947. He had crashed the party and became inebriated, leaving a poor impression of himself with Hatrick. A year later, Gary Cooper and his wife, Veronica, invited Hatrick and Stewart to a dinner party, and the two began dating. A former model, Hatrick was divorced with two children. Stewart and Hatrick were married at Brentwood Presbyterian Church on August 9, 1949, and remained married until her death from lung cancer in 1994.\nThe couple purchased a home in Beverly Hills in 1951, where they resided for the rest of their lives. They also owned the Winecup Gamble Ranch in Nevada from 1953 to 1957. Stewart adopted Gloria's two sons, Ronald (1944\u20131969) and Michael (born 1946), and with Gloria he had twin daughters, Judy and Kelly, on May 7, 1951. Ronald was killed in action in Vietnam on June 8, 1969, at the age of 24, while serving as a lieutenant in the Marine Corps.\nFriendships, interests, and character.\nStewart was guarded about his personal life and, according to biographer Scott Eyman, tended in interviews to avoid the emotional connection he was known for in his films, preferring to keep his thoughts and feelings to himself. He was known as a loner who did not have intimate relationships with many people. Director John Ford said of Stewart, \"You don't get to know Jimmy Stewart; Jimmy Stewart gets to know you.\"\nStewart's 50-year friendship with Henry Fonda began in Manhattan when Fonda invited Stewart to be his third roommate (in addition to Joshua Logan and Myron McCormick) to make the rent. When Stewart moved to Hollywood in 1935, he again shared an apartment with Fonda, and the two gained reputations as playboys. Over their careers, they starred in four films together: \"On Our Merry Way\" (1948), \"How the West Was Won\" (1962), \"Firecreek\" (1968), and \"The Cheyenne Social Club\" (1970). Both Stewart's and Fonda's children later noted that their fathers' favorite activity when not working seemed to be quietly sharing time together while building and painting model airplanes, a hobby they had taken up in New York years earlier. Besides building model airplanes, Stewart and Fonda liked to build and fly kites, play golf, and reminisce about the \"old days\". After Fonda's death in 1982, Stewart's only public comment was \"I've just lost my best friend.\" Their friendship was chronicled in Scott Eyman's biography, \"Hank and Jim\" (2017).\nAside from Fonda, Stewart's close friends included his former agent, Leland Hayward; director John Ford; photographer John Swope, Stewart's former roommate; and Billy Grady, the talent scout who discovered Stewart and also served as the best man at his wedding. Gary Cooper was another close friend of Stewart's. On April 17, 1961, Cooper was too ill with cancer to attend the 33rd Academy Awards ceremony, so Stewart accepted the honorary Oscar on his behalf.\nIn addition to his film career, Stewart had diversified investments, including real estate, oil wells, the charter-plane company Southwest Airways, and membership on major corporate boards; he became a multimillionaire. Already prior to his enlistment in the Air Corps, he had been an avid pilot, with a private pilot certificate and a commercial pilot license, as well as over 400 hours of flying time. A highly proficient pilot, he entered a cross-country race with Leland Hayward in 1937 and was one of the early investors in Thunderbird Field, a pilot-training school built and operated by Southwest Airways in Glendale, Arizona.\nStewart was also active in philanthropy over the years. He served as the national vice-chairman of entertainment for the American Red Cross's fund-raising campaign for wounded soldiers in Vietnam, as well as contributed donations for improvements and restorations to Indiana, his hometown in Pennsylvania. His signature charity event, \"The Jimmy Stewart Relay Marathon Race\", held annually since 1982, has raised millions of dollars for the Child and Family Development Center at St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California.\nStewart was a lifelong supporter of scouting, having been a Second Class Scout as a youth and being awarded the Silver Buffalo Award for service to youth in 1958. He was also an adult Scout leader, and in the 1970s and 1980s, he made advertisements for the Boy Scouts of America, which led to his being incorrectly identified as an Eagle Scout. An award for Boy Scouts, \"The James M. Stewart Good Citizenship Award\" has been presented since 2003. Stewart was also a Life Member of the Sons of the Revolution in California.\nPolitical views.\nStewart was a staunch conservative Republican throughout his life. A political argument in 1947 reportedly led to a fistfight with friend Henry Fonda (a liberal Democrat), according to some accounts, but the two maintained their friendship by never discussing politics again. The fistfight may be apocryphal, as Jhan Robbins quotes Stewart as saying, \"Our views never interfered with our feelings for each other. We just didn't talk about certain things. I can't remember ever having an argument with him\u2060\u2014ever!\"\nIn 1964, Stewart campaigned for the conservative presidential candidate Barry Goldwater and, according to biographer Marc Eliot, erred on the obsessive prior to the election. Stewart was a hawk on the Vietnam War and maintained that his son, Ronald, did not die in vain. Following the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, Stewart, Charlton Heston, Kirk Douglas, and Gregory Peck issued a statement calling for support of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Gun Control Act of 1968.\nStewart actively supported Ronald Reagan's bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976. He attended Reagan's campaign rallies, in one speech assuring that he was more conservative than ever, regardless of the death of his son in the Vietnam War. In the last years of his life, he supported the re-election of Jesse Helms to the Senate in 1990 and also donated to the campaign of Bob Dole for the 1996 presidential election.\nIn 1988, Stewart made a plea in Congressional hearings, along with Burt Lancaster, Katharine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, film director Martin Scorsese, and many others, against Ted Turner's decision to 'colorize' classic black-and-white films, including \"It's a Wonderful Life\". Stewart stated, \"the coloring of black-and-white films is wrong. It's morally and artistically wrong and these profiteers should leave our film industry alone.\"\nIn 1989, Stewart founded the American Spirit Foundation to apply entertainment-industry resources to developing innovative approaches to public education and to assist the emerging democracy movements in the former Iron Curtain countries.\nFinal years and death.\nStewart's wife Gloria died of lung cancer on February 16, 1994, aged 75. According to biographer Donald Dewey, her death left Stewart depressed and \"lost at sea\". Stewart became even more reclusive, spending most of his time in his bedroom, exiting only to eat and visit with his children. He shut out most people from his life, not only media and fans, but also his co-stars and friends. His friends Leonard Gershe and Gregory Peck said Stewart was not depressed or unhappy, but finally allowed to rest and be alone.\nStewart was hospitalized after falling in December 1995. In December 1996, he was due to have the battery in his pacemaker changed but opted not to have it done. In February 1997, he was hospitalized for an irregular heartbeat. On June 25, a thrombosis formed in his right leg, leading to a pulmonary embolism one week later. Stewart died of a heart attack caused by the embolism at the age of 89, surrounded by his children at his home in Beverly Hills, on July 2, 1997. President Bill Clinton commented that America had lost a \"national treasure\u00a0...\u00a0a great actor, a gentleman and a patriot\". He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. More than 3,000 mourners attended his memorial service, including June Allyson, Carol Burnett, Bob Hope, Lew Wasserman, Nancy Reagan, Esther Williams, and Robert Stack. Brig. Gen. James Stewart was given a funeral with full military honors and a three-volley salute.\nActing style and screen persona.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHe had the ability to talk naturally. He knew that in conversations people \"do\" often interrupt one another and it's not always so easy to get a thought out. It took a little time for the sound men to get used to him, but he had an \"enormous\" impact. And then, some years later, Marlon came out and did the same thing all over again\u2014but what people forget is that Jimmy did it first.\n\u2014Cary Grant on Stewart's acting technique.\nAccording to biographer Scott Eyman, Stewart was an instinctive actor. He was natural and at ease in front of the camera, despite his shy off-screen personality. In line with his natural and conversational acting style, Stewart's co-stars found him easy to work with, as he was willing to improvise around any situation that arose while filming. Later in his career, Stewart began to resent his reputation of having a \"natural\" acting technique. He asserted that there was not anything natural about standing on a sound stage in front of lights and cameras while acting out a scene.\nStewart had established early in his career that he was proficient at communicating personality and character nuances through his performances alone. He used an \"inside-out\" acting technique, preferring to represent the character without accents, makeup, and props. Additionally, he tended to act with his body, not only with his voice and face; for example, in \"Harvey\", Stewart portrays the main character's age and loneliness by slightly hunching down. He was also known for his pauses that had the ability to hold the audience's attention. Film critic Geoffrey O'Brien related that Stewart's \"stammering pauses\" created anxious space for the audience, leaving them in anticipation for the scene which Stewart took his time leading up to.\nStewart himself claimed to dislike his earlier film performances, saying he was \"all hands and feet\", adding that he \"didn't seem to know what to do with either\". He mentioned that even though he did not always like his performances, he would not get discouraged. He said, \"But I always tried, and if the script wasn't too good, well, then, I just tried a little bit harder. I hope, though, not so hard that it shows.\" Former co-star Kim Novak stated of his acting style that for emotional scenes, he would access emotions deep inside of him and would take time to wind down after the scene ended. He could not turn it off immediately after the director yelled cut.\nStewart was particularly adept at performing vulnerable scenes with women. Jack Lemmon suggested that Stewart's talent for performing with women was that he was able to allow the audience to see the respect and gentility he felt toward the women through his eyes. He showed that his characters needed them as much as their characters needed him. In connection to Stewart's screen persona with women, Peter Bradshaw said \"The Philadelphia Story\" is \"a film every school pupil should see\" due to Stewart's character's clear explanation of sexual consent after being accused of taking advantage of the main female character.\nStewart's screen persona was that of an \"everyman\", an ordinary man placed in extraordinary circumstances. Audiences could identify with him, in contrast to other Hollywood leading men of the time, such as Cary Grant, who represented what the audience wanted to become. Stewart's screen persona has been compared to those of Gary Cooper and Tom Hanks. Eyman suggested that Stewart could portray several different characters: \"the brother, the sweetheart, [and] the nice guy next door with a bias toward doing the right thing: always decent but never a pushover\". In Stewart's early career, Louella Parsons described his \"boyish appeal\" and \"ability to win audience sympathy\" as the reasons for his success as an actor; Stewart's performances appealed to both young and old audiences. According to film scholar Dennis Bingham, Stewart's essential persona was \"a small-town friendly neighbor, with a gentle face and voice and a slim body that is at once graceful and awkward\". Unlike many actors who developed their on-screen persona over time, Stewart's on-screen persona was recognizable as early as \"Art Trouble\" (1934), his uncredited debut film role, where Stewart was relaxed and comfortable on screen. He portrayed this persona most strongly in the 1940s, but maintained a classic everyman persona throughout his career.\nFilm scholar Dennis Bingham wrote that Stewart was \"both a 'personality' star and a chameleon\" who evoked both masculine and feminine qualities. Consequently, it was difficult for filmmakers to sell Stewart as the stereotypical leading man, and thus he \"became a star in films that capitalized on his sexual ambivalence\". Stewart's asexual persona as a leading man was unusual for the time period for an actor who was not mainly a comedian. However, during his career \"Stewart [encompassed] the furthest extremes of American masculinity, from Reaganite militarist patriotism to Hitchcockian perversity\".\nAccording to Roger Ebert, Stewart's pre\u2013World War II characters were usually likable, but in postwar years directors chose to cast Stewart in darker roles, such as Jeffries in \"Rear Window\". Ebert put this into contemporary perspective by asking, \"What would it feel like to see [Tom Hanks] in a bizarre and twisted light?\", explaining that it is jarring to see a beloved everyman persona such as Stewart in dark roles. Furthermore, Jonathan Rosenbaum explained that since audiences were more interested in Stewart's \"star persona\" and \"aura\" than his characters, \"this makes it more striking when Anthony Mann and Alfred Hitchcock periodically explore the neurotic and obsessive aspects of Stewart's persona to play against his all-American innocence and earnestness.\"\nFilm scholar John Belton argued that rather than playing characters in his films, Stewart often played his own screen persona. He had difficulty playing famous historical personages because his persona could not accommodate the historical character. Belton explained that \"James Stewart is more James Stewart than Glenn Miller in \"The Glenn Miller Story\" (1954) or Charles Lindbergh in \"The Spirit of St. Louis\" (1957).\" Moreover, Jonathan Rosenbaum continued that Stewart's \"pre-existing life-size persona\" in \"Winchester '73\" \"helped to shape and determine the impact of [his character] in [this film]\". On the other hand, Stewart has been described as a character actor who went through several distinct career phases. According to film scholar Amy Lawrence, the main elements of Stewart's persona, \"a propensity for physical and spiritual suffering, lingering fears of inadequacy\", were established by Frank Capra in the 1930s and were enhanced through his later work with Hitchcock and Mann. John Belton explained that \"James Stewart evolves from the naive, small-town, populist hero of Frank Capra's 1930s comedies to the bitter, anxiety-ridden, vengeance-obsessed cowboy in Anthony Mann's 1950s Westerns and the disturbed voyeur and sexual fetishist in Alfred Hitchcock's 1950s suspense thrillers.\" During his postwar career, Stewart usually avoided appearing in comedies, \"Harvey\" and \"Take Her, She's Mine\" being exceptions. He played many different types of characters, including manipulative, cynical, obsessive, or crazy characters. Stewart found that acting allowed him to express the fear and anxiety that he could not express during the war; his post-war performances were received well by audiences because they could still see the innocent, pre-war Stewart underneath his dark roles. According to Andrew Sarris, Stewart was \"the most complete actor-personality in the American cinema\".\nWork.\nFilmography.\nSelected credits:\nLegacy.\nStewart is remembered for portraying idealist \"everyman\" characters in his films. His heroism on screen and devotion to his family made him relatable and representative of the American ideal, leading Stewart to be considered one of the best-loved figures in twentieth-century American popular culture. According to film scholar Dennis Bingham, \"his ability to 'play'\u2014even symbolize\u2014honesty and 'American ideals' made him an icon into whose mold later male stars tried to pour themselves\". Similarly, film scholar James Naremore has called Stewart \"the most successful actor of the 'common man' in the history of movies\" and \"the most intensely-emotional leading man to emerge from the studio system\", who could cry on screen without losing his masculinity. David Thomson has explained Stewart's appeal by stating that \"we wanted to be him, and we wanted to be liked by him\", while Roger Ebert has stated that \"whether he played everyman, or everyman's hidden psyche, Stewart was an innately likable man whose face, loping gait and distinctive drawl became famous all over the world\". Among Stewart's most recognizable qualities was his manner of speaking with a hesitant drawl. According to film scholar Tim Palmer, \"Stewart's legacy rests on his roles as the nervous idealist standing trial for, and gaining stature from, the sincerity of his beliefs, while his emotive convictions are put to the test.\" Film critic David Ansen wrote about Stewart's appeal as a person in addition to his appeal as an actor. Ansen retold a story in which Jack Warner, upon being told about Ronald Reagan's presidential ambitions, said, \"No. Jimmy Stewart for president, Ronald Reagan for best friend.\" Ansen further explained that Stewart was the ultimate trustworthy movie star.\nIn contrast to his popularly remembered \"all-American\" screen persona, film critics and scholars have tended to emphasize that his performances also showed a \"dark side\". According to film scholar Murray Pomerance, \"the other Jimmy Stewart ... was a different type altogether, a repressed and neurotic man buried beneath an apparently calm facade, but ready at any moment to explode with vengeful anxiety and anger, or else with deeply twisted and constrained passions that could never match up with cheery personality of the alter ego.\" Bingham has described him as having \"two coequal personas; the earnest idealist, the nostalgic figure of the homespun boy next door; and the risk-taking actor who probably performed in films for more canonical auteurs than any other American star\". According to him, it is this complexity and his ambiguous masculinity and sexuality with which he approached his roles that characterized his persona. Naremore has stated that there was a \"troubled, cranky, slightly-repressed feeling in [Stewart's] behavior\", and Thomson has written that it was his dark side that produced \"great cinema\".\nStewart was one of the most sought-after actors in 1950s Hollywood, proving that independent actors could be successful in the film industry, which led more actors in Hollywood to forego studio contracts. According to Bingham, Stewart marked \"the transition between the studio period...and the era of free-lance actors, independent production, and powerful talent agents that made possible the \"new kind of star\" of the late 1960s\". Although Stewart was not the first big-name freelance actor, his \"mythic sweetness and idealism [which] were combined with eccentric physical equipment and capacity as an actor to enact emotion, anxiety, and pain\" enabled him to succeed in both the studio system, which emphasized the star as a real person, and the skeptical post-studio era.\nA number of Stewart's films have become classics of American cinema, with twelve of his films having been inducted into the United States National Film Registry as of 2019, and five\u2014\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939), \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940), \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946), \"Rear Window\" (1954), and \"Vertigo\" (1958)\u2014being featured on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest American films of all time. Stewart and Robert De Niro share the title for the most films represented on the AFI list. Stewart is also the most represented leading actor on the \"100 Greatest Movies of All Time\" list presented by \"Entertainment Weekly\". Two of his characters\u2014Jefferson Smith in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939) and George Bailey in \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946)\u2014made AFI's list of the one hundred greatest heroes and villains, and \"Harvey\" (1950) and \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940) were included in their list of Greatest American Comedies. In 1999, the American Film Institute (AFI) ranked Stewart third on its list of the greatest American male actors.\nAwards and honors.\nIn 1960, Stewart was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1700 Vine Street for his contributions to the film industry. In 1974, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. His Golden Plate was presented by Awards Council member Helen Hayes. In 1997, Princeton University, Stewart's alma mater, honored him with the dedication of the James M. Stewart Theater along with a retrospective of his films. Stewart has also been honored with his own postal stamp as part of the \"Legends of Hollywood\" stamp series. In 1999, a bust of Stewart was unveiled at the Eighth Air Force Heritage Museum in Georgia. The L. Tom Perry Special Collections Library at Brigham Young University houses his personal papers and movie memorabilia including letters, scrapbooks, recordings of early radio programs, and two of his accordions. Stewart donated his papers and memorabilia to the library after becoming friends with the curator of its arts and communications collections, James D'Arc.\nMemorials.\nStewart has several memorials in his childhood hometown, Indiana, Pennsylvania. On May 20, 1995, his 87th birthday, The Jimmy Stewart Museum was established. The museum is located near his birthplace, his childhood home, and the former location of his father's hardware store. The museum has six galleries that include photos, memorabilia, personal mementos, movie posters, props, scripts, costumes and much more. Stewart had contributed significant donations to his hometown, and had done it quietly as he didn't want the publicity. A large statue of Stewart stands on the lawn of the Indiana County Courthouse, and a plaque marks his birthplace. In 1983, Jimmy Stewart came back to Indiana to celebrate his 75th birthday and unveiled the statue along with getting a phone call from then President Ronald Reagan to congratulate him on his birthday. 2011, the United States Post Office located at 47 South 7th Street in Indiana, Pennsylvania, was designated the \"James M. 'Jimmy' Stewart Post Office Building\". Additionally, the Indiana County\u2013Jimmy Stewart Airport was named in his honor. His personal Cessna-310 airplane is refurbished and on display outside the airport that bears his name. His childhood home is still standing and overlooks his beloved hometown.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16274", "revid": "49905838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16274", "title": "Jalalabad", "text": "City in Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan\nJalalabad, previously known as Tarunshahr, and historically known as Nagarahara or Adinapur, is the fifth-largest city of Afghanistan. It has a population of about 200,331, and serves as the capital of Nangarhar Province in the eastern part of the country, about from the capital Kabul. Jalalabad is located at the junction of the Kabul River and the Kunar River in a plateau to the south of the Hindu Kush mountains. It is linked by the Kabul-Jalalabad Road to the west and Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, to the east through Torkham and the Khyber Pass.\nJalalabad is a leading center of social and trade activity because of its proximity with the Torkham border checkpoint and border crossing, away. Major industries include papermaking, as well as agricultural products including oranges, lemon, rice, and sugarcane, helped by its warm climate. It hosts Afghanistan's second largest educational institute, Nangarhar University. For centuries the city was favored by Afghan kings and it has a cultural significance in Afghan poetry. During Timur Shah's reign of the Durrani Empire, Jalalabad served as the Afghan winter capital.\nHistory.\nAncient and medieval.\nKnown at the time by names such as Nagarahara and Adinapur, Jalalabad was a major center of Greco-Buddhist culture during the late 1st millennium BCE, focused on sites such as Ahin Posh.\nThe first surviving references to the city are in early 1st millennium CE accounts by visiting Chinese Buddhist monks. In or about 400 CE, Faxian visited \"Nagarahara\" and worshiped at sacred Buddhist sites, such as the \"Cave of the Buddha's Shadow\u201d (\u4f5b\u5f71\u7a9f). In 630 CE, Xuan Zang, visited \"Adinapur\" and other locations nearby.\nThe Buddhist era began to end after the region was conquered by Muslim forces during the late 1st Millennium. However, conversions to Islam evidently did not occur quickly. In \"Hudud-al-Alam\", written in 982 CE, there is reference to a village near Jalalabad where the local king had Muslim, Buddhist and Hindu wives.\nThe region became part of the Ghaznavid Empire in the 10th century. Sabuktigin annexed the land all the way west of the Neelum River in Kashmir. \"The Afghans and Khiljies who resided among the mountains having taken the oath of allegiance to Sabuktigin, many of them were enlisted in his army, after which he returned in triumph to Ghazni.\" The Ghurids succeeded the Ghaznavids and expanded the Islamic empire further into Hindustan. The region around Jalalabad later became part of the Khalji territory, followed by that of the Timurids.\nModern.\nIt is said that the original name of Jalalabad was Adinapur or Nagar(a)hara. Jalalabad was named in the last decade of the sixteenth century in honour of Mughal ruler Jalal-uddin Mohammad Akbar, the grandson of the founder of the Mughal Empire: Babur. Babur had chosen the site for this city which was built by his grandson in 1560.\nIt remained part of the Mughal Empire until around 1738 when Nader Shah and his Afsharid forces defeated the Mughals. Nader Shah's forces were accompanied by the young Ahmad Shah Durrani and his 4,000-strong Afghan army from southern Afghanistan. In 1747, he founded the Durrani Empire (Afghan Empire) after re-conquering the area. The Afghan army has long used the city while going back and forth during their military campaigns into the Indian-subcontinent.\nIn 1834, Dost Mohammad Khan subjugated Jalalabad in his campaign to Jalalabad.\nThe British-Indian forces invaded Jalalabad in 1838, during the First Anglo-Afghan War. In the 1842 Battle of Jellalabad, Akbar Khan besieged the British troops on their way to Jalalabad. In 1878, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the British again invaded and set up camps in Jalalabad but withdrew two years later.\nJalalabad was besieged by rebel tribes in November 1928, marking the start of the Afghan Civil War of 1928-1929.\nJalalabad is considered one of the most important cities of the Pashtun culture. Seraj-ul-Emarat, the residence of Amir Habibullah and King Amanullah was destroyed in 1929 when Habibullah Kalakani rose to power; the other sanctuaries however, retain vestiges of the past. The mausoleum of both rulers is enclosed by a garden facing Seraj-ul-Emart. The Sulemankhils, a Pashtun family famous for their scientific research, is from Jalalabad. Other celebrated Pashtun families originate from the villages near Jalalabad too.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, construction started on a new planned city called Reg-e Shamshad Khan.\nFrom 1978 to early 1990s, the city served as a strategic location for the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and was temporarily renamed to Tarunshahr, in honour of Daoud Tarun. In March 1989, two Mujahideen rebel factions backed by Pakistan and the U.S. assaulted the city during the Battle of Jalalabad. However government forces managed to drive them out within two months, which was a major setback to the resistance fighters and the ISI. The city was heavily bombarded and hundreds of civilians were killed. Many buildings, such as schools, hospitals and public buildings were destroyed during the 2-month battle.\nAfter the resignation of President Najibullah, Jalalabad quickly fell to mujahideen rebels of Yunus Khalis on April 19, 1992. On September 12, 1996, the Taliban took control of the city until they were toppled by the US-backed Afghan forces in late 2001. Al-Qaeda had been building terrorist training camps in Jalalabad. The city returned to Afghan government control under Hamid Karzai.\nThe economy of Jalalabad gradually increased in the last decade. Many of the city's population began joining the Afghan National Security Forces. Construction has also increased. The Jalalabad Airport has long served as a military base for the NATO forces. In 2011, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul announced that it plans to establish a consulate in Jalalabad. In March 2007, US marines murdered 19 unarmed civilians and wounded 50 near Jalalabad, in an incident compared by the New York Times to the Haditha massacre. None of those responsible received any serious punishment. Many suicide attacks by jihadist insurgents have taken place, including in August 2013, April 2015, January 2018, July 2018, September 2018, October 2019 and August 2020. The groups responsible for the attacks include the Taliban, Haqqani Network, al-Qaeda, and ISIS (Daesh).\nOn August 15, 2021, the Taliban again took control of the city. Its capture cut off the last highway from Kabul to the outside world, and the city fell later the same day. Three days later on August 18, protestors took down the Afghan Taliban flag and replaced it with a tricolor flag of the previous Afghan government.\nOn 31 August 2025 a magnitude 6.0 earthquake located 27 kilometers east-northeast of Jalalabad killed over 3,000 people and injured 4,000.\nDemographics.\nThe city population is estimated to be 280,685 in year 2021. It has six districts and a total land area of . The total number of dwellings in this city is 39,586.\nNearly all residents of Jalalabad are Muslim, followers of Sunni Islam. Jalalabad is also a center of the country's Sikhs, although the community has dwindled in the city (and nationwide) since the wars began. Similarly it is also has a Hindu minority.\nLand use.\nJalalabad is the regional hub in eastern Afghanistan, close to the border with Pakistan. Agriculture is the predominant land use at 44%, higher density of dwellings is found in Districts 1\u20135 and vacant plots are largely clustered in District 6. Districts 1\u20136 all have a grid network of roads.\nClimate.\nJalalabad's climate is hot desert (K\u00f6ppen: BWh), and it is one of the hottest localities in Afghanistan. The city's climate has close resemblance to that of Arizona in the United States. It receives six to eight inches (152 to 203\u00a0mm) of rainfall per annum which are limited to winter and the months of spring. Frosts are not common, and during the summer, the temperature can reach a maximum of 120\u00a0\u00b0F (49\u00a0\u00b0C).\nThe north and southwestern parts of the city which has lower elevation are welcoming places to winds from the north and west cooling the parts in summer months. Jalalabad has the highest relative humidity in summer compared to other Afghan cities. However the moderate temperatures of winter has led to various people down the history establishing their settlements in the city. Because of its warm temperature relative to most of Afghanistan, Jalalabad (alongside Peshawar) was often the \"winter capital\" of various Afghan rulers of the past centuries, while rich people would relocate to villas in Jalalabad to avoid the freezing temperatures in Kabul.\nFlora and fauna.\nJalalabad is home to a large number of fruit. Various types of citrus fruits like orange, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, lime grow in gardens as well as in orchards. The orange trees yield a crop only once in three years. The \"narindj\" variety of orange is the most common one which has yellow skin and its taste is a combination of orange and grapefruit. The grapefruits grown here have a diameter of eight or nine inches. Per year 1800 tonnes of pomegranates, 334 tonnes of grapes, and 7750 tonnes of mulberries are produced in Jalalabad. The fruits are either sold in local markets or transported to Kabul markets from where they are exported. The second most common crop is local \"vatani\" variety of sugarcane. It contains 15% sugar by weight. Jalalabad also has the largest date farm in Afghanistan.\nTransportation.\nThe Jalalabad Airport (also known as Nangarhar Airport) is located roughly southeast from the city's center. It is a domestic airport for civilian use. It serves the population of Nangarhar and neighboring provinces.\nThere are proposals for the establishment of Afghanistan's rail network linking Jalalabad with Pakistan Railways, allowing for increased trade of goods, people and commerce between the two countries.\nJalalabad is connected by main roads with the Afghan capital of Kabul, the city of Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, and several nearby Afghan cities and towns. All trade between Afghanistan and Pakistan passes through this city. The highway between Jalalabad and Kabul was resurfaced in 2006, reducing the transit time between these two important cities. This highway is considered to be one of the most dangerous in the world because of the large number of accidents. An improvement in the road networks between Jalalabad and Peshawar has also been proposed, with the intention of widening the existing road and improving security to attract more tourists and allow for safer passage of goods between to the two countries.\nGeneral places of interest.\nThe Ghazi Amanullah International Cricket Stadium is next to the Ghazi Amanullah Khan Town, which is about of driving distance southeast of Jalalabad. The people of Jalalabad go there not only for sports purposes but also for enjoyment and relaxation. This is especially during holidays or when they receive visiting family or friends from another place. It is also a popular hangout for those with cars. \nSports.\nThe province is represented in domestic cricket competitions by the Nangarhar province cricket team. National team member Hamid Hasan was born in the province and he currently represents Afghanistan in international cricket. The Ghazi Amanullah International Cricket Stadium is the first international standard cricket stadium in Afghanistan. It is located in the Ghazi Amanullah Town, a modern suburb on the southeastern fringe of Jalalabad in Nangarhar Province. Construction on the stadium began in March 2010 when the foundation stone was laid by Minister of Finance and president of the Afghanistan Cricket Board, Omar Zakhilwal. The project, which was developed on 30 acres of land donated by the developer constructing the Ghazi Amanullah Town, cost up the first phase of construction $1.8 million. The first phase, which took one year to complete, included the completion of the stadium itself. The remainder of the phases will see the construction of a pavilion, accommodation for players and administrative buildings. The stadium, which has a capacity of 14,000, was completed before the national team and under-19 team left for Canada and the Under-19 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Ireland respectively. The two sides inaugurated the stadium in a Twenty20 match. It is hoped that the stadium will be able to attract international teams to play Afghanistan, who currently have One Day International status until at least 2013.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lying on the northwest coast of Java, the world's most populous island, Jakarta is the largest metropole in Southeast Asia and serves as the Headquarters of ASEAN. The Special Region has a status equivalent to that of a province and is bordered by the province of West Java to the south and east and Banten to the west. Its coastline faces the Java Sea to the north, and it shares a maritime border with Lampung to the west. Jakarta's metropolitan area has an estimated population of 41.9 million as of 2025, making it the largest urban area in Indonesia and the world; in addition of being ASEAN's second largest economy after Singapore.\nJakarta is the economic, cultural, and political centre of Indonesia. Although Jakarta extends over only and thus has the smallest area of any Indonesian province, its metropolitan area covers , which includes the satellite cities of Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, South Tangerang, and Bekasi. Jakarta ranks first among the Indonesian provinces in the human development index. Jakarta's business and employment opportunities, along with its ability to offer a potentially higher standard of living compared to other parts of the country, have attracted migrants from across the Indonesian archipelago, making it a melting pot of numerous cultures.\nJakarta is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Southeast Asia. Established in the fourth century as Sunda Kelapa, the city became an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom. At one time, it was the overseas administrative center of the Dutch East India Company, as well the Imperial Dutch capital of the Dutch East Indies, when it was known as Batavia. Jakarta was officially a city within West Java until 1960 when its official status was changed to a province with special capital region distinction. As a province, its government consists of five administrative cities and one administrative regency. Jakarta is an alpha world city and the ASEAN secretariat's seat. Financial institutions such as the Bank of Indonesia, Indonesia Stock Exchange, and corporate headquarters of numerous Indonesian companies and multinational corporations are located in the city. Jakarta, as Indonesia's largest Muslim-majority city, is known for its tradition of religious tolerance and pluralism. The Istiqlal Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia, stands as a symbol of the city's commitment to interfaith harmony.\nJakarta's main challenges include rapid urban growth, ecological breakdown, air pollution, gridlocked traffic, congestion, and flooding due to subsidence and water extraction (sea level rise is relative, not absolute). Part of North Jakarta is sinking up to 17\u00a0cm (6.7\u00a0inches) annually; meanwhile, the southern part is relatively safe. This has made the northern part of the city more prone to flooding and one of the fastest-sinking capitals in the world. In response to these challenges, in August 2019, President Joko Widodo announced plans to move the capital from Jakarta to the planned city of Nusantara, in the province of East Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. The MPR approved the move on 18 January 2022. The Indonesian government is not abandoning Jakarta after announcing plans to move the country's capital, its planning minister said, pledging to spend US$40 billion, which is more than the cost to build Nusantara, to save the city in the next decade.\nName.\nJakarta has been home to multiple settlements. Below is the list of names used during its existence:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorical names\nThe Buni people is a prehistoric clay pottery culture that flourished in coastal northern West Java, Jakarta, and Banten around 400 BC to 100 AD and survived until 500 AD.\nSundapura is the name mentioned in the Tugu inscription from Tarumanagara, a kingdom in coastal West Java.\u200aThe strategic geographical position of coastal West Java, which corresponds to today modern Jakarta, is a commanding region that controls the Sunda Strait. This location is strategic in regard to Sumatra and also its connection to Asian continent of India and China.\nAfter the fall of the Tarumanagara, the name of city was changed to 'Sunda Kelapa' or 'Coconut of Sunda,' growing to be the main harbour for the Sunda Kingdom due to its desirable location.\nThe name 'Jakarta' is derived from the word \"Jayakarta\" (Devanagari: \u091c\u092f\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0924), which is ultimately derived from the Sanskrit \u091c\u092f \"jaya\" (victorious), and \u0915\u0943\u0924 \"krta\" (accomplished, acquired), thus \"Jayakarta\" translates as 'victorious deed', 'complete act', or 'complete victory'. It was named for the Muslim troops of Fatahillah which successfully defeated and drove the Portuguese away from the city in 1527, eventually renaming it 'Jayakarta.' Tom\u00e9 Pires, a Portuguese apothecary, wrote the name of the city in his magnum opus as \"Jacatra\" or \"Jacarta\" during his journey to the East Indies.\nAfter the Dutch East India Company took over the area in 1619, they renamed it 'Batavia', after the Batavi, a Germanic tribe who were seen as the ancestors of the Dutch. The city was then also known as (Queen of the Orient), a name that was given for the urban beauty of downtown Batavia's canals, mansions and ordered city layout. After expanding to the south in the 19th century, this nickname came to be more associated with the suburbs (e.g. Menteng and the area around Merdeka Square), with their wide lanes, green spaces and villas.\nDuring the Japanese occupation, the city was renamed as . After the Japanese surrender, the name was changed to 'Jakarta'.\nHistory.\nPrecolonial era.\nThe north coast area of western Java including Jakarta was the location of prehistoric Buni culture that flourished from 400 BC to 100 AD. The area in and around modern Jakarta was part of the 4th-century Sundanese kingdom of Tarumanagara, one of the oldest Hindu kingdoms in Indonesia. The area of North Jakarta around Tugu became a populated settlement in the early 5th century. The Tugu inscription (probably written around 417 AD) discovered in Batutumbuh hamlet, Tugu village, Koja, North Jakarta, mentions that King Purnawarman of Tarumanagara undertook hydraulic projects; the irrigation and water drainage project of the Chandrabhaga river and the Gomati river near his capital. Following the decline of Tarumanagara, its territories, including the Jakarta area, became part of the Hindu Kingdom of Sunda. From the 7th to the early 13th century, the port of Sunda was under the Srivijaya maritime empire. According to the Chinese source, \"Chu-fan-chi\", written circa 1225, Chou Ju-kua reported in the early 13th century that Srivijaya still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java (Sunda). The source says the port of Sunda was strategic and thriving, mentioning pepper from Sunda as among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture, and their houses were built on wooden piles. The harbour area became known as Sunda Kelapa () and by the 14th century, it was an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom.\nThe first European fleet, four Portuguese ships from Malacca, arrived in 1513 while looking for a route to obtain spices. The Sunda Kingdom made an alliance treaty with the Portuguese by allowing them to build a port in 1522 to defend against the rising power of the Demak Sultanate from central Java. In 1527, Fatahillah, a Pasai-born military commander of Demak attacked and conquered Sunda Kelapa, driving out the Portuguese. Sunda Kelapa was renamed Jayakarta, and became a fiefdom of the Banten Sultanate, which became a major Southeast Asian trading centre.\nThrough the relationship with Prince Jayawikarta of the Banten Sultanate, Dutch ships arrived in 1596. In 1602, an English East India Company (EIC) voyage led by Sir James Lancaster arrived in Aceh and sailed on to Banten, where they were allowed to build a trading post. This site became the centre of English trade in the Indonesian archipelago until 1682. Jayawikarta is thought to have made trading connections with the English merchants, who were rivals with the Dutch, by allowing them to build houses directly across from the Dutch buildings in 1615.\nColonial era.\nWhen relations between Prince Jayawikarta and the Dutch deteriorated, his soldiers attacked the Dutch fortress. His army and their EIC allies, however, were defeated by the Dutch, in part owing to the timely arrival of Jan Pieterszoon Coen. The Dutch burned the EIC trading post and forced them to retreat to their ships. The victory consolidated Dutch power, and they renamed the city \"Batavia\" in 1619.\nCommercial opportunities in the city attracted native and especially Chinese and Arab immigrants. This sudden population increase created burdens on the city. Tensions grew as the colonial government tried to restrict Chinese migration through deportations. Following a revolt, 5,000 Chinese were massacred by the Dutch and natives on 9 October 1740, and the following year, Chinese inhabitants were moved to Glodok outside the city walls. At the beginning of the 19th century, around 400 Arabs and Moors lived in Batavia, a number that changed little during the following decades. Among the commodities traded were fabrics, mainly imported cotton, \"batik\" and clothing worn by Arab communities.\nThe city began to expand further south as epidemics in 1835 and 1870 forced residents to move away from the port. The \"Koningsplein\", now Merdeka Square was completed in 1818, the housing park of Menteng was started in 1913, and Kebayoran Baru was the last Dutch-built residential area. By 1930, Batavia had more than 500,000 inhabitants, including 37,067 Europeans. The city was expanded in 1935 through the annexation of the town of Meester Cornelis, modern Jatinegara.\nOn 5 March 1942, the Japanese captured Batavia from Dutch control, and the city was named Jakarta (, under the special status that was assigned to the city). After the war, the Dutch name Batavia was internationally recognised until full Indonesian independence on 27 December 1949. The city, renamed Jakarta, was officially proclaimed the national capital of Indonesia.\nIndependence.\nAfter World War II ended, Indonesian nationalists declared independence on 17 August 1945, and the government of Jakarta City was changed into the Jakarta National Administration in the following month. During the Indonesian National Revolution, Indonesian republicans withdrew from Allied-occupied Jakarta and established their capital in Yogyakarta.\nAfter securing full independence, Jakarta again became the national capital in 1950. With Jakarta selected to host the 1962 Asian Games, Sukarno, envisaging Jakarta as a great international city, instigated large government-funded projects with openly nationalistic and modernist architecture. Projects included a cloverleaf interchange, a major boulevard (Jalan MH Thamrin-Sudirman), monuments such as The National Monument, Hotel Indonesia, a shopping centre, and a new building intended to be the headquarters of CONEFO. In October 1965, Jakarta was the site of an abortive coup attempt in which six top generals were killed, precipitating a violent anti-communist purge which killed at least 500,000 people, including some ethnic Chinese. The event marked the beginning of Suharto's New Order. The first government was led by a mayor until the end of 1960 when the office was changed to that of a governor. The last mayor of Jakarta was Soediro until he was replaced by Soemarno Sosroatmodjo as governor.\nIn 1966, Jakarta was declared a 'special capital region' (), with a status equivalent to that of a province separated from West Java. Based on law No. 5 of 1974 relating to regional governments, the Jakarta Special Capital Region was confirmed as the capital of Indonesia and one of the country's then 26 provinces. Lieutenant General Ali Sadikin served as governor from 1966 to 1977; he rehabilitated roads and bridges, encouraged the arts, and built hospitals and a large number of schools. He cleared out slum dwellers for new development projects \u2014 some for the benefit of the Suharto family,\u2014 and attempted to eliminate rickshaws and ban street vendors. He began control of migration to the city to stem overcrowding and poverty. Foreign investment contributed to a real estate boom that transformed the face of Jakarta. The boom ended with the 1997 Asian financial crisis, putting Jakarta at the centre of violence, protest, and political manoeuvring.\nAfter three decades in power, support for President Suharto began to wane. Tensions peaked when four students were shot dead at Trisakti University by security forces. Four days of riots and violence in 1998 ensued that killed an estimated 1,200, and destroyed or damaged 6,000 buildings, forcing Suharto to resign. Much of the rioting targeted Chinese Indonesians. In the post-Suharto era, Jakarta has remained the focal point of democratic change in Indonesia. Jemaah Islamiyah-connected bombings occurred almost annually in the city between 2000 and 2005, with another in 2009. In August 2007, Jakarta held its first-ever election to choose a governor as part of a nationwide decentralisation program that allows direct local elections in several areas. Previously, governors were elected by the city's legislative body.\nBetween 2016 and 2017, a series of terrorist attacks rocked Jakarta with scenes of multiple suicide bombings and gunfire. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi claimed responsibility for the attacks on behalf of Islamic State.\nDuring the Jokowi presidency, the Government adopted a plan to move Indonesia's capital to Nusantara after 17 August 2024, but this has not occurred due to delays.\nOn 30 November 2024, President Prabowo Subianto signed Law No. 151/2024, which changed Jakarta's designation from a Special Capital Region to a Special Region, a change that applies to the titles of the governor and the Jakarta Regional House of Representatives.\nGeography.\nJakarta covers , the smallest among any Indonesian provinces. However, its metropolitan area covers , which extends into the two bordering provinces of West Java and Banten. The Greater Jakarta area includes three bordering regencies (Bekasi Regency, Tangerang Regency and Bogor Regency) and five adjacent cities (Bogor, Depok, Bekasi, Tangerang and South Tangerang).\nJakarta is situated on the northwest coast of Java, at the mouth of the Ciliwung River on Jakarta Bay, an inlet of the Java Sea. It is strategically located near the Sunda Strait. The northern part of Jakarta is plain land, some areas of which are below sea level, and subject to frequent flooding. The southern parts of the city are hilly. It is one of only two Asian capital cities located in the southern hemisphere (along with East Timor's Dili). Officially, the area of the Jakarta Special District is of land area and of sea area. The Thousand Islands, which are administratively a part of Jakarta, are located in Jakarta Bay, north of the city.\nJakarta lies in a low and flat alluvial plain, ranging from with an average elevation of above sea level with historically extensive swampy areas. Some parts of the city have been constructed on reclaimed tidal flats that occur around the area. Thirteen rivers flow through Jakarta. They are Ciliwung River, Kalibaru, Pesanggrahan, Cipinang, Angke, Maja, Mookervart, Krukut, Buaran, West Tarum, Cakung, Petukangan, Sunter River and Grogol River. They flow from the Puncak highlands to the south of the city, then across the city northwards towards the Java Sea. The Ciliwung River divides the city into the western and eastern districts. These rivers, combined with the wet season rains and insufficient drainage due to clogging, make Jakarta prone to flooding.\nMoreover, Jakarta is sinking about each year, and up to in the northern coastal areas. After a feasibility study, a ring dyke known as Giant Sea Wall Jakarta is under construction around Jakarta Bay to help cope with the threat from the sea. The dyke will be equipped with a pumping system and retention areas to defend against seawater and function as a toll road. The project is expected to be completed by 2025. In January 2014, the central government agreed to build two dams in Ciawi, Bogor and a tunnel from Ciliwung River to Cisadane River to ease flooding in the city. Nowadays, a , with capacity per second, underground water tunnel between Ciliwung River and the East Flood Canal is being worked on to ease the Ciliwung River overflows. In 2023, the New York Times reported that in some places Jakarta is sinking up to 12 inches (30\u00a0cm) annually.\nEnvironmental advocates point out that subsidence is driven by the extraction of groundwater, much of it illegal. Furthermore, the government's lack of strict regulation amplifies the issue as many recently built high-rise buildings, corporations, and factories around Jakarta opt for illegally extracting groundwater. In fact, in a recent inspection of 80 buildings in Jalan Thamrin, a busy road lined with skyscrapers and shopping malls, 56 buildings had a groundwater pump, and 33 were pumping groundwater illegally. This could be halted by stopping extraction (as the city of Tokyo has done), increasing efficiency, and finding other sources for water use. Moreover, increasing regulation through higher taxes or limiting groundwater pumping has proven to help cities like Shanghai, Tokyo, and San Jose relieve their subsidence issue. The rivers of Jakarta are highly polluted and currently unsuitable for drinking water.\nJakarta faces significant air pollution, particularly during the dry season from August to December. Dry air during this period allows pollutants to remain suspended in the atmosphere for extended periods, contributing to poor air quality.\nClimate.\nJakarta experiences a tropical monsoon climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Am\"), bordering on a tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen:\u00a0\"Af\"). as classified by the system. The city's wet season spans most of the year, from October to May. The dry season lasts from June to September, with each of these months receiving less than of rainfall on average. Situated in the western part of Java, Jakarta sees its highest rainfall in January and February, averaging per month, while the driest month is August, with an average rainfall of .\nEvery year faces recurring issues, such as floods and thunderstorms. A cyclonic vortex leads to moisture convergence over a large area, including western Java Island. Additionally, this vortex causes a mainly meridional monsoon flow, where near-surface winds blow almost perfectly from north to south over West Java. The impact of these predominant northerly winds hitting the rugged topography in southern West Java likely contributes to the increased convection that causes floods in Jakarta.\nAverage temperatures are very high with moderate rainfall. During the day, the temperature usually hovers around but drops to about in the evening. These are average temperatures, and some days can be hotter. It's advisable to dress appropriately to handle the heat. January is the rainiest month, with over of precipitation, whereas August is the driest, with around of rainfall. The average temperature in the coldest month (February) is , and in the warmest month (October), it is . Sea temperatures range from in August to in March, April, November, and December. Record low temperatures in Jakarta recorded , while the highest record reached .\nCityscape.\nMost cityscape in Jakarta includes landmarks, monuments, and statues were begun in the 1960s during the Sukarno era, then completed in the Suharto era, while some date from the colonial period. Although many of the projects were completed after his presidency, Sukarno, who was an architect, is credited for planning Jakarta's monuments and landmarks, as he desired the city to be the beacon of a powerful new nation. Among the monumental projects that were built, initiated, and planned during his administration are the National Monument, Istiqlal mosque, the Legislature Building, and the Gelora Bung Karno stadium. Sukarno also built many nationalistic monuments and statues in the capital city.\nThe most famous landmark, which became the symbol of the city, is the obelisk of the National Monument ( or \"Monas\") in the centre of Merdeka Square. On its southwest corner stands a Mahabharata-themed Arjuna Wijaya chariot statue and fountain. Further south through Jalan M.H. Thamrin, one of the main avenues, the \"Selamat Datang\" monument stands on the fountain in the centre of the Hotel Indonesia roundabout. Other landmarks include the Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta Cathedral, and the Immanuel Church. The former Batavia Stadhuis, Sunda Kelapa port in Jakarta Old Town is another landmark. The Autograph Tower in Central Jakarta, at 382.9\u00a0metres is the tallest building in Indonesia. The most recent landmark built is the Jakarta International Stadium.\nSome of the statues and monuments are nationalist, such as the West Irian Liberation Monument, the Tugu Tani, the Youth statue, and the Dirgantara Monument. Some statues commemorate Indonesian national heroes, such as the Diponegoro and Kartini statues in Merdeka Square. The Sudirman and Thamrin statues are located on the streets bearing their names. There is also a statue of Sukarno and Hatta at the Proclamation Monument as well as at the entrance to Soekarno\u2013Hatta International Airport.\nArchitecture.\nJakarta has architecturally significant buildings spanning distinct historical and cultural periods. Architectural styles reflect Malay, Sundanese, Javanese, Arabic, Chinese, and Dutch influences. External influences inform the architecture of the Betawi house. The houses were built of nangka wood (\"Artocarpus integrifolia\") and comprised three rooms. The shape of the roof is reminiscent of the traditional Javanese joglo. Additionally, the number of registered cultural heritage buildings has increased.\nColonial buildings and structures include those that were constructed during the colonial period. The dominant colonial styles can be divided into three periods: the Dutch Golden Age (17th to late 18th century), the transitional style period (late 18th century \u2013 19th century), and Dutch modernism (20th century). Colonial architecture is apparent in houses and villas, churches, civic buildings, and offices, mostly concentrated in the Jakarta Old Town and Central Jakarta. Architects such as J.C. Schultze and Eduard Cuypers designed some of the significant buildings. Schultze's works include Jakarta Art Building, the Indonesia Supreme Court Building and Ministry of Finance Building, while Cuypers designed Bank Indonesia Museum and Mandiri Museum. In the early 20th century, most buildings were built in Neo-Renaissance style. By the 1920s, the architectural taste had begun to shift in favour of rationalism and modernism, particularly art deco architecture. The elite suburb Menteng, developed during the 1910s, was the city's first attempt at creating ideal and healthy housing for the middle class. The original houses had a longitudinal organisation, with overhanging eaves, large windows, and open ventilation, all practical features for a tropical climate. These houses were developed by N.V. de Bouwploeg, and established by P.A.J. Moojen.\nAfter independence, the process of nation-building in Indonesia and demolishing the memory of colonialism was as important as the symbolic building of arterial roads, monuments, and government buildings. The National Monument in Jakarta, designed by Sukarno, is Indonesia's beacon of nationalism. In the early 1960s, Jakarta provided highways and super-scale cultural monuments as well as Senayan Sports Stadium. The parliament building features a hyperbolic roof reminiscent of German rationalist and Corbusian design concepts. Built-in 1996, Wisma 46 soars to a height of and its nib-shaped top celebrates technology and symbolises stereoscopy.\nThe urban construction boom continued during the 21st century. The Golden Triangle of Jakarta is one of the fastest evolving CBD's in the Asia-Pacific region. According to CTBUH and Emporis, there are 88 skyscrapers that reach or exceed , which puts the city in the top 10 of world rankings. It has more buildings taller than 150\u00a0metres than any other Southeast Asian or Southern Hemisphere cities.\nParks and public spaces.\nIn June 2011, Jakarta had only 10.5% green open spaces (), although this grew to 13.94%. Public parks are included in public green open spaces. There are about 300 integrated child-friendly public spaces (RPTRA) in the city in 2019. As of 2014, 183 water reservoirs and lakes supported the greater Jakarta area.\nDemographics.\nJakarta attracts people from across Indonesia, often in search of employment. The 1961 census showed that 51% of the city's population was born in Jakarta. Inward immigration tended to negate the effect of family planning programs. The Ministry of Home Affairs () tabulates its own data, which has improved since ID cards were required in the last decade, lists Jakarta's population at 11,261,595 at yearend 2021.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBetween 1961 and 1980, the population of Jakarta doubled, and during the period 1980\u20131990, the city's population grew annually by 3.7%. The 2010 census counted some 9.58\u00a0million people, well above government estimates. The population rose from 4.5\u00a0million in 1970 to 9.5\u00a0million in 2010, counting only legal residents, while the population of Greater Jakarta rose from 8.2\u00a0million in 1970 to 28.5\u00a0million in 2010. As of 2014, the population of Jakarta stood at 10\u00a0million, with a population density of 15,174 people/km2. In 2014, the population of Greater Jakarta was 30\u00a0million, accounting for 11% of Indonesia's overall population. It is predicted to reach 35.6\u00a0million people by 2030 to become the world's biggest megacity. The gender ratio was 102.8 (males per 100 females) in 2010, and 101.3 in 2014.\nEthnicity.\nJakarta is pluralistic and religiously diverse, without a majority ethnic group. As of 2010, 36.17% of the city's population were Javanese, 28.29% Betawi (locally established mixed race, cemented by diverse creole), 14.61% Sundanese, 6.62% Chinese, 3.42% Batak, 2.85% Minangkabau, 0.96% Malays, Indo and others 7.06%.\nThe 'Betawi' (, or 'people of Batavia') are immigrant descendants of the old city who became widely recognised as an ethnic group by the mid-19th century. They mostly descend from an eclectic mix of Southeast Asians brought or attracted to meet labour needs. They are thus a Creole ethnic group who came from much of Indonesia. Over generations, most have intermarried with one or more ethnicities, especially people of Chinese, Arab, and European descent. Most Betawis lived in the fringe zones with few Betawi-majority zones of central Jakarta. It is thus a conundrum for some first generation Betawi people, especially multi-generational Jakarta residents, to identify as either their parents' ethnicity or Betawi since living in a Betawi-majority district and speaking more of that creole and adapting is a matter of preference for such families.\nA significant Chinese community has lived in Jakarta for many centuries. They traditionally reside around old urban areas, such as Pinangsia, PIK, Pluit and Glodok (Jakarta's Chinatown) areas. They also can be found in the old Chinatowns of Senen and Jatinegara. As of 2001 they self-identified as being 5.5% of the population, which was thought of as under-reported; this explains the 6.6% figure ten years later.\nThe Sumatran residents are diverse. According to the 2020 census, roughly 361,000 Batak; 300,960 Minangkabau and 101,370 Malays lived in the city. The number of Batak people has grown in ranking, from eighth in 1930 to fifth in 2000. Toba Batak is the largest subset in Jakarta. Working Minangkabau in the 1980s in high proportions were well-embedded merchants, artisans, doctors, teachers or journalists. Minang merchants are found in traditional markets, such as Tanah Abang and Senen.\nLanguage.\nIndonesian is the official and dominant language of Jakarta, while many elderly people speak Dutch or Chinese, depending on their upbringing. English is used for communication, especially in Central and South Jakarta. Each of the ethnic groups uses their mother tongue at home, such as Betawi, Javanese, and Sundanese. The Betawi language is distinct from those of the Sundanese or Javanese, forming itself as a language island in the surrounding area. It is mostly based on the East Malay dialect and enriched by loan words from Dutch, Portuguese, Sundanese, Javanese, Chinese, and Arabic. Over time, many Betawi words and phrases became integrated into Indonesian as Jakartan slang and are used by most people regardless of their ethnic background. It is now popular not only in Jakarta, but all over Indonesia.\nThe Chinese in Jakarta mainly speak Indonesian and English due to a strict language ban during the Soeharto New Order era; older people may be fluent in Hokkien dialect and Mandarin, meanwhile the younger generation are fluent in Indonesian and English, some educated in Mandarin. With the recent urbanisation of Chinese communities from several rural areas in Indonesia, other Chinese dialects have been brought into the Chinese community in Jakarta, such as Hakka, Teochew and Cantonese. Hokkien, which is mainly from Sumatra (Medan, Bagansiapiapi, Batam) is mostly spoken in Northern Jakarta, such as in Pantai Indah Kapuk, Pluit, and Kelapa Gading, meanwhile Hakka and Teochew, which are derived from the Chinese communities in Pontianak and Singkawang, are mainly spoken in West Jakarta, like in Tambora and Grogol Petamburan. The Batak in Jakarta mostly speak Indonesian, while the older generation tend to speak their native languages, such as Batak Toba, Mandailing, and Karo, depending on which ancestral towns and places in North Sumatra they came from. The Minangkabau mainly speak Minangkabau together with Indonesian.\nSundanese language as the native language of the Sundanese people, as well as the language of Sunda Kalapa, the old name of Jakarta, is still used by the native population in several administrative villages in Jakarta. Most of them are in East Jakarta, namely in Pondok Ranggon and Jatinegara Kaum. In Pondok Ranggon, the language used by the native people is Bogor Sundanese, while in Jatinegara Kaum, especially in RW 03, they use Banten Sundanese, because they are descendants of the Banten prince's troops. Apart from that, Sundanese language is also spoken in other places, one of which is in the Thousand Islands, specifically on Lancang Besar.\nEducation.\nJakarta is home to numerous educational institutions. The University of Indonesia (UI) is the largest and oldest tertiary-level educational institution in Indonesia. It is a public institution with campuses in Salemba (Central Jakarta) and in Depok. The three other public universities in Jakarta are Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University Jakarta, the State University of Jakarta (UNJ), University of Pembangunan Nasional 'Veteran' Jakarta (UPN \"Veteran\" Jakarta), and Universitas Terbuka or Indonesia Open University. There is a vocational higher education, Jakarta State Polytechnic. Some major private universities in Jakarta are Trisakti University, The Christian University of Indonesia, Mercu Buana University, Tarumanagara University, Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia, Pelita Harapan University, Pertamina University, Bina Nusantara University, Jayabaya University, Persada Indonesia \"YAI\" University, and Pancasila University.\nSTOVIA (\"School tot Opleiding van Indische Artsen\" (School for Education of Native Physicians), now University of Indonesia) was the first college in Jakarta, established in 1851. Jakarta houses many students from around Indonesia, many of whom reside in dormitories or home-stay residences. For basic education, a variety of primary and secondary schools are available, tagged with the public (\"national\"), private (\"national and bi-lingual national plus\"), and \"international\" labels. Four of the major international schools are the British School Jakarta, Gandhi Memorial Intercontinental School, IPEKA Integrated Christian School, and the Jakarta Intercultural School. Other international schools in Jakarta metropolitan area include the ACG School Jakarta, Australian Independent School, Bina Bangsa School, Deutsche Schule Jakarta, Global Jaya School, Jakarta Indonesia Korean School, Jakarta Japanese School, Jakarta Multicultural School, Jakarta Taipei School, Lyc\u00e9e fran\u00e7ais de Jakarta, New Zealand School Jakarta, North Jakarta Intercultural School, Sekolah Pelita Harapan, and Singapore Intercultural School.\nReligion.\nIn 2024, Jakarta's religious composition was distributed over Islam (83.83%), Protestantism (8.6%), Catholicism (3.9%), Buddhism (3.46%), Hinduism (0.18%), Confucianism (0.017%), and about 0.013% of population claimed to follow folk religions.\nMost (Islamic boarding schools) in Jakarta are affiliated with the traditionalist Nahdlatul Ulama, modernist organisations mostly catering to a socioeconomic class of educated urban elites and merchant traders. They give priority to education, social welfare programs, and religious propagation. Many Islamic organisations have headquarters in Jakarta, including Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesian Ulema Council, Muhammadiyah, Indonesia Institute of Islamic Dawah, and Jaringan Islam Liberal.\nThe Roman Catholic community has a Metropolis, the Archdiocese of Jakarta that includes West Java and Banten provinces as part of the ecclesiastical province. Jakarta also hosts the largest Buddhist adherents in Java, where most of the followers are Chinese. Schools of Buddhism practised in Indonesia vary, including Therav\u0101da, Mah\u0101y\u0101na, Vajrayana, and Tridharma. The city also has a Hindu community, which mainly are Balinese and Indian people. There is also a Sikh and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith community presence in Jakarta.\nEconomy.\nIndonesia is the largest economy of ASEAN, and Jakarta is the economic nerve centre of the Indonesian archipelago. Jakarta's nominal GDP was US$203.702\u00a0billion and PPP GDP was US$602.946\u00a0billion in 2021, which is about 17% of Indonesia's GDP. Jakarta was ranked 21st in the list of \"Cities of Economic Influence Index\" in 2020 by CEOWORLD magazine. According to the \"Japan Center for Economic Research\", GRP per capita of Jakarta will rank 28th among the 77 cities in 2030 from 41st in 2015, the largest in Southeast Asia. Savills Resilient Cities Index has predicted Jakarta to be within the top 20 cities in the world by 2028.\nJakarta's economy depends highly on manufacturing and service sectors such as banking, trading and finance. Industries include electronics, automotive, chemicals, mechanical engineering, and biomedical sciences. The head office of Bank Indonesia and the Indonesia Stock Exchange are located in the city. Most of the SOEs including Pertamina, PLN, Angkasa Pura, and Telkomsel operate head offices in the city, as do major Indonesian conglomerates, such as Salim Group, Sinar Mas Group, Astra International, Gudang Garam, Kompas-Gramedia, CT Corp, Emtek, and MNC Group. The headquarters of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Indonesian Employers Association are also located in the city. As of 2017, the city is home to six Forbes Global 2000, two Fortune 500 and seven Unicorn companies.\nGoogle and Alibaba have regional cloud centres in Jakarta. In 2017, economic growth was 6.22%. Throughout the same year, the total value of the investment was Rp 108.6\u00a0trillion (US$8\u00a0billion), an increase of 84.7% from the previous year. In 2021, nominal GDP per capita was estimated at Rp 274.710\u00a0million (US$19,199). The most significant contributions to GRDP were by the finance, ownership and business services (29%); the trade, hotel and restaurant sector (20%), and the manufacturing industry sector (16%).\nThe Wealth Report 2015 by Knight Frank reported that 24 individuals in Indonesia in 2014 had wealth of at least US$1\u00a0billion and 18 live in Jakarta. The cost of living continues to rise. Both land prices and rents have become expensive. Mercer's \"2017 Cost of Living Survey\" ranked Jakarta as the 88th costliest city in the world for expatriates. Industrial development and the construction of new housing thrive on the outskirts, while commerce and banking remain concentrated in the city centre. Jakarta has a bustling luxury property market. Knight Frank, a global real estate consultancy based in London, reported in 2014 that Jakarta offered the highest return on high-end property investment in the world in 2013, citing a supply shortage and a sharply depreciated currency as reasons.\nShopping.\nAs of 2015, with a total of 550 hectares, Jakarta had the largest shopping mall floor area within a single city. Malls include Plaza Indonesia, Grand Indonesia, Sarinah, Plaza Senayan, Senayan City, Pacific Place, Gandaria City, \u00c6ON Mall Jakarta Garden City and Tanjung Barat, Mall Taman Anggrek, Central Park Mall, as well as Pondok Indah Mall. Fashion retail brands in Jakarta include Debenhams at Senayan City and Lippo Mall Kemang Village, Japanese Sogo, Seibu at Grand Indonesia Shopping Town, and French brand, Galeries Lafayette, at Pacific Place. The Satrio-Casablanca shopping belt includes Kuningan City, Mal Ambassador, Kota Kasablanka, and Lotte Shopping Avenue. Shopping malls are also located at Grogol and Puri Indah in West Jakarta.\nTraditional markets include Blok M, Mayestik, Tanah Abang, Senen, Pasar Baru, Glodok, Mangga Dua, Cempaka Mas, and Jatinegara. Special markets sell antique goods at Jalan Surabaya and gemstones in Rawabening Market.\nTourism.\nThough Jakarta has been named the most popular location as per tag stories, and ranked eighth most-posted among the cities in the world in 2017 on image-sharing site Instagram, it is not a top international tourist destination. The city, however, is ranked as the fifth fastest-growing tourist destination among 132 cities according to MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index.\nThe World Travel and Tourism Council also listed Jakarta as among the top ten fastest-growing tourism cities in the world in 2017 and categorised it as an \"emerging performer\", which will see a significant increase in tourist arrivals in less than ten years.\nAccording to \"Euromonitor International's latest Top 100 City Destinations Ranking\" of 2019, Jakarta ranked at 57th among 100 most visited cities of the world.\nMost of the visitors attracted to Jakarta are domestic tourists. As the gateway of Indonesia, Jakarta often serves as a stop-over for foreign visitors on their way to other Indonesian tourist destinations such as Bali, Lombok, Komodo Island and Yogyakarta. In 2023 about 1.97 million foreign tourists visited the city.\nJakarta is trying to attract more international tourists through MICE tourism, and arranging increasing numbers of conventions. In 2012, the tourism sector contributed Rp. 2.6\u00a0trillion (US$268.5\u00a0million) to the city's total direct income of Rp. 17.83\u00a0trillion (US$1.45\u00a0billion), a 17.9% increase from the previous year 2011.\nCulture.\nAs the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta is a melting pot of cultures from all ethnic groups in the country. Although Betawi people are Jakarta's indigenous community, the city's culture represents many languages and ethnic groups, favouring differences in religion, tradition, and linguistics, rather than a single, dominant culture. Jakarta is dominated by Javanese people, followed by Betawi people, and Sundanese people.\nArts and festivals.\nThe Betawi culture is distinct from those of the Sundanese or Javanese, forming a language island in the surrounding area. There is a significant Chinese influence in Betawi culture, reflected in the popularity of Chinese cakes and sweets, firecrackers, and Betawi wedding attire that demonstrates Chinese and Arab influences.\nSome festivals such as the \"Jalan Jaksa Festival\", \"Kemang Festival\", \"Condet Festival\", and \"Lebaran Betawi\" include efforts to preserve Betawi arts by inviting artists to display performances. Mixed Sundanese\u2013Betawi culture can also be found in Pondok Ranggon, southeasternmost tip of Jakarta, namely \"Sedekah Bumi Keramat Ganceng Festival\".

The local cuisine is Betawi cuisine, which reflects various foreign culinary traditions. Betawi cuisine is heavily influenced by Malay-Chinese Peranakan cuisine, Sundanese, and Javanese cuisine, which is also influenced by Indian, Arabic, and European cuisines. One of the most popular local dishes of Betawi cuisine is \"Soto Betawi\" which is prepared from chunks of beef and offal in rich and spicy cow's milk or coconut milk broth. Other popular Betawi dishes include \"soto kaki, nasi uduk (\"mixed rice\"), kerak telor\" (spicy omelette), \"nasi ulam, asinan, ketoprak, rujak\" and \"gado-gado\" Betawi (salad in peanut sauce).\nJakarta cuisine can be found in modest street-side \"warung\" food stalls and Hawkers travelling vendors to high-end fine dining restaurants. Live music venues and exclusive restaurants are abundant. Many traditional foods from far-flung regions in Indonesia can be found in Jakarta. For example, traditional Padang restaurants and low-budget \"Warteg\" (\"Warung Tegal\") food stalls are ubiquitous in the capital. Other popular street foods include \"nasi goreng\" (fried rice), \"sate\" (skewered meats), \"pecel lele\" (fried catfish), \"bakso\" (meatballs), \"bakpau\" (Chinese bun) and \"siomay\" (fish dumplings).\nJalan Sabang, Jalan Sidoarjo, Jalan Kendal at Menteng area, Kota Tua, Blok S, Blok M, Jalan Tebet, are all popular destinations for street-food lovers. Minangkabau street-food who sell \"Nasi Kapau\", \"Sate Padang\", and \"Soto Padang\" can be found at Jalan Kramat Raya and Jalan Bendungan Hilir in Central Jakarta. Chinese street-food is plentiful at Jalan Pangeran, Manga Besar and Petak Sembilan in the old Jakarta area, while the \"Little Tokyo\" area of Blok M has many Japanese style restaurants and bars.\nTrendy restaurants, cafe and bars can be found at Menteng, Kemang, Jalan Senopati, Kuningan, Senayan, Pantai Indah Kapuk, and Kelapa Gading. Lenggang Jakarta is a food court, accommodating small traders and street vendors, where Indonesian foods are available within a single compound. At present, there are two such food courts, located at Monas and Kemayoran. Thamrin 10 is a food and creative park located at Menteng, where varieties of food stall are available.\nGlobal fast-food chains are present and usually found in Shopping malls, along with local brands like Bakmi GM, Kopi Kenangan, Sederhana, , , D'Cost, Roti Bunz, Klenger Burger, Janji Jiwa, Tomoro, J'CO, Es Teler 77, Kebab Turki, CFC, and Japanese HokBen and Yoshinoya. Foreign cuisines such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Singaporean, Indian, American, Australian, Malaysian, French, Mediterranean cuisines like Maghrebi, Turkish, Italian, Middle Eastern cuisine, and modern fusion food restaurants can all be found in Jakarta.\nSports.\nJakarta hosted the 1962 Asian Games, and the 2018 Asian Games, co-hosted by Palembang. Jakarta also hosted the Southeast Asian Games in 1979, 1987, 1997 and 2011 (supporting Palembang). Gelora Bung Karno Stadium hosted the group stage, quarterfinal and final of the 2007 AFC Asian Cup along with Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. The largest capacity retractable roof stadium in Asia, Jakarta International Stadium, is located at Tanjung Priok district, completed in 2022. After the success of the Asian Games, the city made a bid to host the 2032 Summer Olympics but did not enter into the final evaluation and was awarded to Brisbane. If the city had been chosen, it would have been the first city in Southeast Asia to host the senior Olympic Games and the first to be held in the region since the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics.\nThe Senayan sports complex has several sports venues, including the Bung Karno football stadium, Madya Stadium, Istora Senayan, an aquatic arena, a baseball field, a basketball hall, a shooting range, several indoor and outdoor tennis courts. The Senayan complex was built in 1960 to accommodate the 1962 Asian Games. For basketball, the Kelapa Gading Sport Mall in Kelapa Gading, North Jakarta, with a capacity of 7,000 seats, is the home arena of the Indonesian national basketball team. The BritAma Arena serves as a playground for Satria Muda Pertamina Jakarta, the 2017 runner-up of the Indonesian Basketball League. Jakarta International Velodrome is a sporting facility located at Rawamangun, which was used as a venue for the Asian Games. It has a seating capacity of 3,500 for track cycling, and up to 8,500 for shows and concerts, which can also be used for various sports activities such as volleyball, badminton and futsal. Jakarta International Equestrian Park is an equestrian sports venue located at Pulomas, which was also used as a venue for the Asian Games.\nThe Jakarta Car-Free Days are held bi-weekly on Sunday on the main avenues of the city, Jalan Sudirman, and Jalan Thamrin, from 6 am to 11 am. The briefer Car-Free Day, which lasts from 6 am to 9 am, is held every other Sunday. The event invites local pedestrians to do sports and exercise and have their activities on the streets that are usually full of traffic. Along the road from the Senayan traffic circle on Jalan Sudirman, South Jakarta, to the \"Selamat Datang\" Monument at the Hotel Indonesia traffic circle on Jalan Thamrin, north to the National Monument in Central Jakarta, cars are blocked from entering. During the event, morning gymnastics, calisthenics and aerobic exercises, futsal games, jogging, bicycling, skateboarding, badminton, karate, pencak silat, taekwondo, on-street library and musical performances take over the roads and the main parks.\nJakarta's most popular home football club is Persija, which plays in Liga 1. Another football team in Jakarta is Persitara which competes in Liga 3 and plays in Tugu Stadium.\nThe Jakarta Marathon each November is recognised by AIMS and IAAF. It was established in 2013. It brings sports tourism. In 2015, more than 15,000 runners from 53 countries participated.\nJakarta successfully hosted the first Jakarta ePrix race of the Formula E championship in June 2022 at Ancol Circuit, North Jakarta.\nMedia and entertainment.\nJakarta is home to most of the Indonesian national newspapers, besides some local-based newspapers. The daily local newspapers in Jakarta are \"Pos Kota\" and \"Warta Kota\". National newspapers based in Jakarta include \"Kompas\" and \"Media Indonesia\", and most of them have a news segment covering the city. A number of business newspapers (\"Bisnis Indonesia\", \"Investor Daily\" and \"Kontan\") and a sports newspaper (\"Super Ball\") are also published.\nNewspapers other than in Indonesian, mainly for a national and global audience, are also published daily. Examples are the English-language newspapers \"The Jakarta Post\" and online-only \"The Jakarta Globe\". Chinese language newspapers also circulate, such as \"Indonesia Shang Bao\" (\u5370\u5c3c\u5546\u62a5), \"Harian Indonesia\" (\u5370\u5c3c\u661f\u6d32\u65e5\u62a5), and \"Guo Ji Ri Bao\" (\u56fd\u9645\u65e5\u62a5). The only Japanese language newspaper is \"The Daily Jakarta Shimbun\" (\u3058\u3083\u304b\u308b\u305f\u65b0\u805e).\nAround 75 radio stations broadcast in Jakarta, 52 on the FM band, and 23 on the AM band. Radio entities are based in Jakarta, for example, national radio networks MNC Trijaya FM, Prambors FM, Trax FM, I-Radio, Hard Rock FM, Delta FM, Global FM and the public radio RRI; as well as local stations Gen FM, Radio Elshinta and PM2FAS.\nJakarta is the headquarters for Indonesia's public television TVRI as well as private national television networks, such as Metro TV, tvOne, Kompas TV, RCTI and NET. Jakarta has local television channels such as TVRI Jakarta, JakTV, Elshinta TV and KTV. Many TV stations are analogue PAL, but some are now converting to digital signals using DVB-T2 following a government plan to digital television migration.\nGovernment and politics.\nJakarta is administratively equal to a province with special status. The executive branch is headed by an elected governor and a vice governor, while the Jakarta Regional People's Representative Council (, DPRD DKI Jakarta) is the legislative branch with 106 directly elected members. The Jakarta City Hall at the south of Merdeka Square houses the office of the governor and the vice governor and serves as the main administrative office.\nExecutive governance consists of five administrative cities (), each headed by a mayor (w\"alikota)\" and one administrative regency () headed by a regent (\"bupati\"). Unlike other cities and regencies in Indonesia where the mayor or regent is directly elected, Jakarta's mayors and regents are chosen by the governor. Each city and regency is divided into administrative districts.\nAside from representatives to the provincial parliament, Jakarta sends 21 delegates to the national lower house parliament. The representatives are elected from Jakarta's three national electoral districts, which also include overseas voters. It also sends 4 delegates, just like other provinces, to the national upper house parliament.\nThe Jakarta Smart City (JSC) program was launched on 14 December 2014 with the goal of smart governance, smart people, smart mobility, smart economy, smart living, and a smart environment in the city using the web and various smartphone-based apps.\nPublic safety.\nThe Greater Jakarta Metropolitan Regional Police () is the police force that is responsible for maintaining law, security, and order for the Jakarta metropolitan area. It is led by a two-star police general (Inspector General of Police) with the title of \"Greater Jakarta Regional Police Chief\" (, abbreviated ). Its office is located at Jl. Jenderal Sudirman Kav. 55, Senayan, Kebayoran Baru, South Jakarta, and their hotline emergency number is 110.\nThe Jayakarta Military Regional Command (, abbreviated ) is the territorial army of the Indonesian Army, which serves as a defence component for Jakarta and its surrounding areas (Greater Jakarta). It is led by an army Major General with the title of \"Jakarta Military Regional Commander\" (, abbreviated ). The Jakarta Military Command is located at East Jakarta and oversees several military battalions ready to defend the capital city and its vital installations. It also assists the Jakarta Metropolitan Police during certain tasks, such as supporting security during state visits, VVIP security, and riot control.\nMunicipal finances.\nThe Jakarta provincial government relies on transfers from the central government for the bulk of its income. Local (non-central government) sources of revenue are incomes from various taxes such as vehicle ownership and vehicle transfer fees, among others. The ability of the regional government to respond to Jakarta's many problems is constrained by limited finances.\nThe provincial government consistently runs a surplus of between 15 and 20% of planned spending, primarily because of delays in procurement and other inefficiencies. Regular under-spending is a matter of public comment. In 2013, the budget was around Rp 50\u00a0trillion ($US5.2\u00a0billion), equivalent to around $US380 per citizen. Spending priorities were on education, transport, flood control, environment, and social spending (such as health and housing). Jakarta's regional budget (APBD) was Rp 77.1\u00a0trillion ($US5.92\u00a0billion), Rp 83.2\u00a0trillion ($US6.2\u00a0billion), and Rp 89\u00a0trillion ($US6.35\u00a0billion) for the year of 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively.\nAdministrative divisions.\nJakarta consists of five (Administrative cities/municipalities), each headed by a mayor, and one (Administrative regency). Each city and regency is divided into districts (). The administrative cities/municipalities of Jakarta are:\nThe only administrative regency () of Jakarta is the Thousand Islands (), formerly a district within North Jakarta. It is a collection of 105 small islands located on the Java Sea. It is of high conservation value because of its unique ecosystems. Marine tourism, such as diving, water bicycling, and windsurfing, are the primary tourist activities in this territory. The main mode of transportation between the islands is speed boats or small ferries.\nThe province comprises three of Indonesia's 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People's Representative Council. The Jakarta I Electoral District consists of the administrative city of East Jakarta, and elects 6 members to the People's Representative Council. The Jakarta II Electoral District consists of the administrative cities of Central Jakarta and South Jakarta, together with all overseas voters, and elects 7 members to the People's Representative Council. The Jakarta III Electoral District consists of the administrative cities of North Jakarta and West Jakarta, together with the Thousand Islands Regency, and elects 8 members to the People's Representative Council.\nInfrastructure.\nTo transform the city into a more liveable one, a ten-year \"urban regeneration\" project was undertaken, for Rp 571\u00a0trillion ($40.5\u00a0billion). The project aimed to develop infrastructure, including the creation of a better integrated public transit system and the improvement of the city's clean water and wastewater systems, housing, and flood control systems.\nHealthcare.\nJakarta has many of the country's best-equipped private and public healthcare facilities. In 2012, the Governor of Jakarta Joko Widodo introduced a universal health care program, the 'Healthy Jakarta Card' (\"Kartu Jakarta Sehat\", KJS). In January 2014, the Indonesian government launched a universal health care system called the \"Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional\" (JKN), which is run by BPJS Kesehatan. KJS integrated into JKN, and KJS cards were valid till 2018. As of 2021, 85.55% of the people of Jakarta is covered by JKN.\nGovernment-run hospitals are of a good standard but are often overcrowded. Government-run specialised hospitals include Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital, as well as community hospitals and puskesmas. Other options for healthcare services include private hospitals and clinics. The private healthcare sector has seen significant changes since the government began allowing foreign investment in the private sector in 2010. While some private facilities are run by nonprofit or religious organisations, most are for-profit. Hospital chains such as Siloam, Pondok Indah Hospital Group, Mayapada, Mitra Keluarga, Medika, Medistra, Ciputra, Radjak Hospital Group, RS Bunda Group, and Hermina operate in the city.\nWater supply.\nTwo private companies, PALYJA and Aetra, provide piped water in the western and eastern half of Jakarta respectively under 25-year concession contracts signed in 1998. A public asset holding company called PAM Jaya owns the infrastructure. Eighty per cent of the water distributed in Jakarta comes through the West Tarum Canal system from Jatiluhur reservoir on the Citarum River, southeast of the city. The water supply was privatised by President Suharto in 1998 to the French company Suez Environnement and the British company Thames Water International. Both companies subsequently sold their concessions to Indonesian companies. Customer growth in the first seven years of the concessions had been lower than before, possibly because of substantial inflation-adjusted tariff increases during this period. In 2005, tariffs were frozen, leading private water companies to cut down on investments.\nAccording to PALYJA, the service coverage ratio increased substantially from 34% (1998) to 65% (2010) in the western half of the concession. According to data by the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body, access in the eastern half of the city served by PTJ increased from about 57% in 1998 to about 67% in 2004 but stagnated afterward. However, other sources cite much lower access figures for piped water supply to houses, excluding access provided through public hydrants: one study estimated access as low as 25% in 2005, while another estimated it to be as low as 18.5% in 2011. Those without access to piped water get water mostly from wells that are often salty and unsanitary. As of 2017, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Jakarta had a crisis over clean water.\nInternational relations.\nInternational organisations.\nJakarta hosts foreign embassies and serves as the seat of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Headquarters and is ASEAN's diplomatic capital. Jakarta also a member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21, C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and ASEAN Smart Cities Network.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nJakarta signed sister city agreements with other cities, including Casablanca. To promote friendship between the two cities, the main avenue famous for its shopping and business centres was named after Jakarta's Moroccan sister city. No street in Casablanca is named after Jakarta. However, the Moroccan capital city of Rabat has an avenue named after Sukarno, Indonesia's first president, to commemorate his visit in 1960 and as a token of friendship.\nJakarta's sister cities are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCooperation and friendship.\nJakarta has established a partnership with Rotterdam, especially on integrated urban water management, including capacity-building and knowledge exchange. This cooperation is mainly because both cities are dealing with similar problems; they lie in low-lying flat plains and are prone to flooding. Additionally, they have both implemented drainage systems involving canals, dams and pumps vital for both cities for below-sea-level areas.\nIn addition to its sister cities, Jakarta cooperates with:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16277", "revid": "27446209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16277", "title": "Jack Ruby", "text": "Murderer of Lee Harvey Oswald (1911\u20131967)\nJack Leon Ruby (born Jacob Leon Rubenstein; c. March 25, 1911\u00a0\u2013 January 3, 1967) was an American nightclub owner who murdered Lee Harvey Oswald on November 24, 1963, two days after Oswald was arrested for the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\nBorn in Chicago, Ruby operated nightclubs in Texas. On November 24, 1963, two days after Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Ruby shot and mortally wounded Oswald in Dallas Police Headquarters and was immediately arrested. The shooting happened on live television. Ruby was convicted and sentenced to death. This was overturned on appeal, and he was granted a new trial, but Ruby fell ill, was diagnosed with cancer, and died of a pulmonary embolism on January 3, 1967.\nIn 1964, the Warren Commission concluded that there was no evidence Ruby was part of a conspiracy, though Ruby's murder of Oswald has stoked assassination conspiracy theories.\nEarly life, family and education.\nJacob Leon Rubenstein on or around March 25, 1911, was born to Joseph Rubenstein, a carpenter, and Fannie Turek Rutkowski (or Rokowsky), both Polish-born Orthodox Jews residing in the Maxwell Street area of Chicago, Illinois. He was the fifth of his parents' 10 surviving children. During his childhood, the parents often behaved violently towards each other and frequently separated; Ruby's mother was eventually committed to a mental hospital.\nHis troubled childhood and adolescence were marked by juvenile delinquency with time being spent in foster homes. He was arrested at the age of 11 for truancy. A childhood friend of Ruby's was the boxer Barney Ross. From his early childhood, Ruby was nicknamed \"Sparky\" by those who knew him. His sister, Eva Grant, said that he acquired the nickname because he resembled a slow-moving horse named \"Spark Plug\" or \"Sparky\" in the contemporary comic strip \"Barney Google\". (\"Spark Plug\" debuted as a character in the strip in 1922.) Other accounts say that the name was given because of his quick temper. Grant stated that Ruby did not like the nickname and was quick to fight anyone who called him that.\nCareer.\nRuby left school at 16. He made money through ticket scalping, selling horse racetrack tip sheets, and as an organizer for the Scrap Iron and Junk Handlers Union. After the union president Leon Cooke was murdered in 1939, Ruby was investigated as a suspect, although he was cleared of any wrongdoing. He was drafted in 1943 and served in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II, working as an aircraft mechanic at US bases until 1946. He had an honorable record and was promoted to Private First Class. Upon discharge, in 1946, Ruby returned to Chicago.\nIn 1947, Ruby moved to Dallas, purportedly because of the failure of merchandise deals in Chicago and to help operate his sister's nightclub. Soon afterward he and his brothers shortened their surnames from Rubenstein to Ruby. The stated reason for the name change was that the name \"Rubenstein\" was too long and that he was \"well known\" as Jack Ruby. Ruby later went on to manage various nightclubs, strip clubs, and dance halls in Dallas. He developed close ties to many Dallas Police officers who frequented his nightclubs, where he provided them with free liquor, prostitutes, and other favors. Ruby's nightclubs were also frequented by Buck Owens, who discovered Lulu Roman\u2014then working as bawdy comic relief at one of Ruby's clubs\u2014and hired Roman to join the cast of \"Hee Haw\".\nRuby developed financial problems during this period and constantly borrowed money from friends, family, and business associates. He was often in conflict with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and at one point owed 6 years of back taxes. In 1959 he became a member of the Dallas Chamber of Commerce due to the help of Judge Joe B. Brown. Brown would later serve as the judge for Ruby's trial for the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald.\nIllegal activities.\nSome critics have said that Ruby was involved in illegal activity such as gambling, narcotics, and prostitution. An FBI report in 1956 stated that informant Eileen Curry had moved to Dallas with her boyfriend James Breen after jumping bail on narcotics charges. Breen told her that he had made connections with a large narcotics setup operating between Texas, Mexico, and the East, and that \"James got the okay to operate through Ruby of Dallas.\" Dallas County Sheriff Steve Guthrie told the FBI that he believed that Ruby \"operated some prostitution activities and other vices out of his club\" in Dallas. Dallas disc jockey Kenneth Dowe testified that Ruby was known around the station for \"procuring women for different people who came to town\".\nFrom 1949, up until the murder of Oswald, Ruby had nine criminal charges, ranging from assault to violating state liquor law.\nCharacter.\nAccording to people interviewed by law enforcement and the Warren Commission, Ruby was desperate to attract attention to himself and his club. He knew a great number of people in Dallas, but had only a few friends. Because his business ventures were unsuccessful, he was heavily in debt.\nThe Commission received reports of Ruby's penchant for violence. He had a volatile temper, and he often resorted to violence with employees who had upset him. He acted as the bouncer of his own club and beat his customers on at least 25 occasions. The fights would often end with Ruby throwing his victims down the club's stairs. In one fight with a man, the man bit Ruby's left index finger so badly that the doctors had it amputated.\nStories of Ruby's eccentric and unstable behavior describe him as sometimes taking his shirt or other clothes off in social gatherings, and either hitting his chest like a gorilla or rolling around on the floor. During conversations, he could change the topic suddenly in mid-sentence. He sometimes welcomed a guest to his club, but on other nights he would forbid the same guest from entering. He was described by those who knew him as \"a kook\", \"totally unpredictable\", \"a psycho\", and \"suffering from some form of disturbance\".\nDuring the 1970s, prominent psychiatrist Irene Jakab, who was known for her use of art therapy in diagnosing and treating patients with mental illness, analyzed artwork that had been created by Ruby while he was in jail. While assessing one of Ruby's drawings, which had been included as part of art exhibits at the World Congress of Psychiatry meeting in Waikiki and the University of Hawaii in late August and early September 1977, she claimed that his work conveyed \"repressed aggression and secretiveness,\" adding:\nNotice how he really constricts himself so as not to reveal himself. He hides behind all those geometrical lines and pointed edges. You can feel his controlled aggression.\nPersonal life.\nRuby never married and had no children. At the time of the assassination, Ruby was living with George Senator, who referred to Ruby as \"my boyfriend\" during the Warren Commission hearing, although he denied the two were homosexual lovers. Warren Commission lawyer Burt Griffin later told author Gerald Posner, \"I'm not sure if Senator was honest with us about his relationship with Ruby. People did not advertise their homosexuality in 1963\".\nJohn F. Kennedy assassination.\nNovember 21.\nThe Warren Commission attempted to reconstruct Ruby's movements from November 21, 1963, through November 24. The Commission reported that he was attending to his duties as the proprietor of the Carousel Club located at 1312 1/2 Commerce St. in downtown Dallas and the Vegas Club in the city's Oak Lawn district from the afternoon of November 21 to the early hours of November 22. A number of Dallas police officers were meeting in the office of Assistant District Attorney Ben Ellis when Ruby entered and passed out business cards advertising a performance by Jada, a stripper at the Carousel. Reportedly, Ruby introduced himself to Ellis and added: \"You probably don't know me now, but you will.\"\nNovember 22: Assassination of Kennedy.\nAccording to the Warren Commission, on November 22, Ruby was in the second-floor advertising offices of the \"Dallas Morning News\", five blocks away from the Texas School Book Depository, placing weekly advertisements for his nightclubs, when he learned of the assassination around 12:45\u00a0p.m. According to witnesses, Ruby was visibly shaken. Ruby then made phone calls to his assistant at the Carousel Club and to his sister. The Commission stated that an employee of the \"Dallas Morning News\" estimated that Ruby left the newspaper's offices at 1:30\u00a0p.m., but indicated that other testimony suggested that he had left earlier. According to the Warren Commission, Ruby arrived back at the Carousel Club shortly before 1:45\u00a0p.m. to notify employees that the club would be closed that evening.\nJohn Newnam, an employee at the newspaper's advertisement department, testified that Ruby became upset over an anti-Kennedy ad published in the \"Morning News\" that was signed by \"The American Fact-Finding Committee, Bernard Weissman, Chairman.\" Ruby was sensitive to antisemitism and was distressed that an ad attacking the President was signed by a person with a \"Jewish name.\" Early the next morning, Ruby noticed a political billboard featuring the text \"IMPEACH EARL WARREN\" in block letters. Ruby's sister Eva testified that Ruby had told her that he believed that the anti-Kennedy ad and the anti-Warren sign were connected and were a plot by a \"gentile\" to blame the assassination on the Jews.\nRuby was seen in the halls of the Dallas Police Headquarters on several occasions after Oswald's arrest for the murder of Dallas policeman J. D. Tippit. He was present at an arranged press conference with Oswald. Ruby later told the FBI that he had his .38 Colt Cobra revolver in his right pocket during the press conference. Newsreel footage from WFAA-TV (Dallas) and NBC shows that Ruby impersonated a newspaper reporter during a press conference held by District Attorney Henry Wade at Dallas Police Headquarters that night. Wade briefed reporters that Oswald was a member of the anti-Castro Free Cuba Committee. Ruby was one of several people there who spoke up to correct Wade, saying, \"Henry, that's the Fair Play for Cuba Committee\", a pro-Castro organization.\nNovember 24: Murder of Oswald.\nOn November 24, at 11:21\u00a0a.m. CST, Oswald was being escorted by Dallas police detectives Jim Leavelle and L. C. Graves through the police basement to an armored car that was to take Oswald to the nearby county jail when Ruby, who was standing in a crowd of reporters, emerged with his revolver aimed at Oswald's abdomen. Ruby passed by William Harrison, who saw the gun and began to reach his hand out. Detective Billy Combest described Ruby's facial expression as that of a \"determined look or grimace\". Ruby fired a single shot into Oswald's abdomen at point-blank range, mortally wounding him. Combest exclaimed, \"Jack, you son of a bitch!\"\nImmediately, Graves grabbed for Ruby's gun, and Harrison grabbed Ruby's shoulder, as the armored car rolling down the ramp the moment Ruby emerged, slightly hit Ruby's leg, causing him to almost lose balance as he was immediately subdued by police. Ruby and Oswald were both taken into the basement level jail office. After Ruby was handcuffed and taken up in the elevator, Oswald was placed in an ambulance and driven to Parkland Memorial Hospital, the same hospital where President Kennedy had died two days earlier.\nAt Parkland, surgeons subsequently determined Ruby's bullet had entered Oswald's left side in the front part of the abdomen and caused extensive damage to his spleen, stomach, aorta, vena cava, kidney, liver, diaphragm, and eleventh rib before coming to rest on his right side. Oswald died at 1:07\u00a0p.m.\nReaction.\nA network television pool camera was broadcasting live to cover Oswald's transfer; millions of people watching on NBC saw the shooting as it happened and in a matter of minutes it was on other networks. Several photographs were taken of the event, capturing the moments when Ruby pulled the trigger. In 1964, Robert H. Jackson of the \"Dallas Times Herald\" was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Photography for his image, titled \"Jack Ruby Shoots Lee Harvey Oswald\".\nGreat indignation was directed towards Ruby's murder of Oswald. Many felt that the killing had robbed the nation of essential information and left key questions unanswered. Former Vice President Richard Nixon said, \"(Oswald was) also entitled to a trial ... two wrongs don't make a right.\" Oswald's murder compounded suspicions that the Kennedy assassination was part of a larger plot.\nNot all were shocked, however. The crowd outside the headquarters applauded when they heard that Oswald had been shot. In Dallas and elsewhere in the nation, Oswald was hated in death, and Ruby was viewed as a hero by some citizens. During his time in jail, he received many letters from the public, often praising him for his actions.\nProsecution.\nAfter his arrest, Ruby said that he had been distraught over Kennedy's death, had wanted to help the city of Dallas \"redeem\" itself in the eyes of the public, and that he was \"saving Mrs. Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back to trial\". He also claimed that he shot Oswald on the spur of the moment when the opportunity presented itself, without considering any reason for doing so. Ruby said that he was an admirer of the Kennedy family, that he cried when he heard that Kennedy was shot, \"in mourning\" after, \"cried a great deal\" Saturday afternoon, and was depressed that night. The grief over the assassination, Ruby stated, finally \"reached the point of insanity,\" suddenly compelling him to shoot when Oswald walked in front of him in the basement that Sunday morning. \nAt the time of the shooting, Ruby said that he was taking phenmetrazine (Preludin), a central nervous system stimulant. Ruby also said that he entered the police basement by coming down the Main Street ramp. Later, Ruby expressed remorse to his brother Earl, saying he never wanted Oswald to die. Ruby asked Dallas attorney Tom Howard to represent him. Howard accepted and asked Ruby if he could think of anything that might damage his defense. Ruby responded that there would be a problem if a man by the name of \"Davis\" should come up. Ruby told his attorney that he \"had been involved with Davis, who was a gunrunner entangled in anti-Castro efforts.\"\nRuby's brother Earl replaced Howard with prominent San Francisco defense attorney Melvin Belli, who agreed to represent him \"pro bono\". Lawyer Joe H. Tonahill also signed on to assist with Ruby's defense. At his bond hearing in January 1964, while talking to reporters, Ruby tearfully said, regarding the assassination of Kennedy, that he could not understand \"how a great man like that could be lost.\" Belli tried to argue that Ruby was mentally ill and employed the insanity defense. He told the press that \"Ruby is an intense, emotional man. Talking to him, the hair rose on the hackles of my neck. I felt horror, revulsion, sadness\". Ruby was uncomfortable with Belli's defense strategy, which included Ruby not testifying at all during the trial. Ruby said he would have liked to testify but that \"Mr. Belli knows better, I guess\".\nRuby stated that he thought he said, \"You killed my President, you rat!\" as he shot Oswald. Officer McMillon testified he heard Ruby say, \"You rat son of a bitch, you shot the president\". This was disputed by footage showing McMillon looking in the opposite direction from the shooting. Dallas police sergeant Patrick Dean testified that when Ruby was arrested, Ruby said he thought about killing Oswald two nights earlier, to show the world that \"Jews have guts.\" Detective Don Archer said Ruby had told him he intended to shoot Oswald three times, and McMillon corroborated this.\nOn March 14, 1964, Ruby was convicted of murder with malice and was sentenced to death. Belli was fired by Ruby and his family as a result. Ruby's conviction was overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on the grounds that \"an oral confession of premeditation made while in police custody\" should have been ruled inadmissible, because it violated a Texas criminal statute. The court also ruled that the venue should have been changed to a Texas county other than the one in which the high-profile crime had been committed.\nDuring the six months following the assassination, Ruby repeatedly asked to speak to the members of the Warren Commission. The Commission initially showed no interest, but Ruby's sister Eileen wrote letters to the Commission and her letters became public. The Commission finally agreed to talk to Ruby. In June 1964, Chief Justice Earl Warren, Representative (and future President) Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, and other Commission members went to Dallas to see Ruby.\nRuby asked Warren several times to take him to Washington D.C., saying that \"my life is in danger here\" and that he wanted an opportunity to make additional statements. He added: \"I want to tell the truth, and I can't tell it here.\" Ruby said that the people from whom he felt himself to be in danger were the John Birch Society of Dallas, including Edwin Walker, who he claimed were trying to falsely implicate him as being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate the President. Warren told Ruby that he would be unable to comply with his request because many legal barriers would need to be overcome, and public interest in the situation would be too heavy. Warren also told Ruby that the Commission would have no way of protecting him since it had no police powers. Ruby said that he wanted to convince President Lyndon Johnson that he was not part of any conspiracy to kill Kennedy.\nEventually, the appellate court agreed with Ruby's lawyers that he should be granted a new trial. On October 5, 1966, the court ruled that his motion for a change of venue before the original trial court should have been granted. Ruby's conviction and death sentence were overturned.\nArrangements were underway for a new trial to be held in February 1967 in Wichita Falls, Texas, but Ruby was admitted to Parkland Hospital on December 9, 1966, suffering from pneumonia, where he was diagnosed with cancer in his liver, lungs, and brain. His condition rapidly deteriorated. An armed guard was placed outside his room, but family and friends were allowed to visit. On December 16, Earl Ruby, accompanied by one of his brother's lawyers, smuggled a tape recorder hidden in a briefcase into Jack's room to record an interview about his murder of Oswald. Ruby maintained that he entered the basement by coming down the ramp, had killed Oswald out of grief over the assassination, and denied knowing Oswald prior. According to an unnamed Associated Press source, Ruby made a final statement from his hospital bed on December 19 that he had acted alone. \"There is nothing to hide,\" Ruby said, \"there was no one else.\"\nDeath.\nRuby died of a pulmonary embolism on January 3, 1967, at Parkland Hospital. He was buried beside his parents in the Westlawn Cemetery in Norridge, Illinois.\nOfficial investigations.\nWarren Commission.\nThe Warren Commission found no evidence linking Ruby's killing of Oswald with any broader conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy. The Warren Report provided a detailed biography of Ruby's life and activities to help ascertain whether he was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy. The Warren Commission also investigated rumors that Ruby and Oswald knew each other and that Oswald was seen at Ruby's Carousel Club. The Warren Commission concluded that various witnesses linking Ruby and Oswald lacked credibility and that there was no solid evidence to link the two men. The Commission indicated that there was not a \"significant link between Ruby and organized crime\" and said Ruby acted independently in killing Oswald.\nThe Warren Commission noted testimony indicating Ruby entered the basement of the headquarters just as Oswald was being transferred, and that Ruby's shooting of Oswald was a spontaneous, unplanned act. Ruby drove into town with his pet dachshund Sheba to send an emergency money order at the Western Union on Main Street to one of his employees. The time stamp was 11:17\u00a0a.m. for the transaction. Ruby then walked half a block to the Dallas police headquarters, where he made his way into the basement. Warren Commission investigator David Belin said that postal inspector Harry Holmes arrived unannounced at the Dallas police station on the morning that Ruby shot Oswald and, upon invitation by the investigators, had questioned Oswald, thus delaying his transfer by half an hour. Belin noted that, had Ruby been part of a conspiracy, he would have been downtown 30 minutes earlier, when Oswald had been scheduled to be transferred. The Commission accepted Ruby's claim that he entered the police basement via the Main Street ramp. Warren Report supporters have questioned why Ruby would have left his beloved dog in his car if his killing of Oswald had been planned.\nSome of Ruby's friends, relatives (notably his brother Earl and sister Eva) and associates, expressed belief that Ruby acted alone, maintaining that he was upset over Kennedy's death, crying on occasions and closing his clubs as a mark of respect. They rejected conspiracy theorists' claims, saying that Ruby's connection with gangsters was minimal at most and that he was not the sort of person who would be entrusted to be part of a conspiracy.\nDallas reporter Tony Zoppi, who knew Ruby well, claimed that one \"would have to be crazy\" to entrust Ruby with anything as important as a high-level plot to kill Kennedy since he \"couldn't keep a secret for five minutes ... Jack was one of the most talkative guys you would ever meet. He'd be the worst fellow in the world to be part of a conspiracy, because he just plain talked too much.\" He and others described Ruby as the sort who enjoyed being at \"the center of attention\", trying to make friends with people and being more of a nuisance.\nSome writers, including former Los Angeles District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi, dismiss Ruby's connections to organized crime as being highly minimal: \"It is very noteworthy that without exception, not one of these conspiracy theorists knew or had ever met Jack Ruby. Without our even resorting to his family and roommate, all of whom think the suggestion of Ruby being connected to the mob is ridiculous, those who knew him, unanimously and without exception, think the notion of his being connected to the Mafia, and then killing Oswald for them, is nothing short of laughable.\"\nBill Alexander, who prosecuted Ruby for Oswald's murder, equally rejected any suggestions that Ruby was involved with organized crime, claiming that conspiracy theorists based it on the claim that \"A knew B, and Ruby knew B back in 1950, so he must have known A, and that must be the link to the conspiracy.\"\nRuby's brother Earl denied allegations that Jack was involved in racketeering at Chicago nightclubs, and author Gerald Posner suggested in his book \"Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK\", that witnesses may have confused Ruby with Harry Rubenstein, a convicted Chicago felon. Zoppi was also dismissive of mob ties and described Ruby as a \"born loser\".\nOther investigations and dissenting theories.\nMany critics have challenged the evidence and conclusions of the Warren Commission and have proposed other theories, particularly regarding Ruby's murder of Oswald.\nRuby's motive.\nWhite House correspondent Seth Kantor, who was a passenger in Kennedy's motorcade, testified that he had visited Parkland Hospital after Kennedy was shot, and that he felt a tug on his coat as he entered the hospital at about 1:30\u00a0p.m. He turned around to see Jack Ruby, who called him by his first name and shook his hand. He said that he had become acquainted with Ruby while he was a reporter for the \"Dallas Times Herald\" newspaper. According to Kantor, Ruby asked him if he thought that it would be a good idea for him to close his nightclubs for the next three nights because of the tragedy, and Kantor responded without thinking that doing so would be a good idea.\nWitness Wilma Tice, testified to the Warren Commission that she saw Jack Ruby at Parkland Hospital. She also said that she saw a man, who may have been Seth Kantor, call Jack Ruby \"Jack\", Ruby denied that he had been at Parkland Hospital and the Warren Commission dismissed Kantor's testimony, saying that the encounter at Parkland Hospital would have to have taken place in a span of a few minutes before and after 1:30 pm, as evidenced by telephone company records of calls made by both people. The Commission also pointed to contradictory witness testimony and to the lack of video confirmation of Ruby at the scene. The Commission concluded that \"Kantor probably did not see Ruby at Parkland Hospital\" and \"may have been mistaken about both the time and the place that he saw Ruby.\"\nIn 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) re-examined Kantor's testimony and stated, \"the Warren Commission concluded that Kantor was mistaken\" about his Parkland encounter with Ruby, but \"the Committee determined he probably was not.\" Kantor wrote in his book, \"Who Was Jack Ruby?\":\nThe mob was Ruby's \"friend.\" And Ruby could well have been paying off an IOU the day he was used to kill Lee Harvey Oswald. Remember: \"I have been used for a purpose,\" the way Ruby expressed it to Chief Justice Warren in their June 7, 1964 session. It would not have been hard for the mob to maneuver Ruby through the ranks of a few negotiable police.\nThe House Select Committee on Assassinations wrote in its 1979 Final Report:\nRuby's shooting of Oswald was not a spontaneous act, in that it involved at least some premeditation. Similarly, the committee believed it was less likely that Ruby entered the police basement without assistance, even though the assistance may have been provided with no knowledge of Ruby's intentions... The committee was troubled by the apparently unlocked doors along the stairway route and the removal of security guards from the area of the garage nearest the stairway shortly before the shooting... There is also evidence that the Dallas Police Department withheld relevant information from the Warren Commission concerning Ruby's entry to the scene of the Oswald transfer.\nThe HSCA suggested Ruby might have entered the basement via a stairway accessible from an alleyway next to the Dallas Municipal Building.\nGarrett C. Hallmark, manager of the parking garage, said that Ruby talked on the phone at 3 p.m. on November 23 to somebody called Ken. He was seeking confirmation of the scheduled time for Oswald's transfer and he said \"You know I'll be there.\" Later that evening, waitress Wanda Helmick at Bull-Pen Drive-In Restaurant in Arlington, Texas, which was operated by Ralph Paul, a close friend and business associate of Ruby, said that Ruby rang Paul and that she overheard that Paul said something about a gun, and he asked Ruby if he were crazy.\nLieutenant Billy Grammer, a dispatcher for the Dallas Police Department, claimed that he received an anonymous phone call at 3 a.m. on November 24 from a man who told him that he knew of the plan to move Oswald from the basement and warned that, unless the plan were changed, \"we are going to kill him.\" After Oswald was shot, Grammer claimed to have recognized Ruby as the caller, and expressed belief that Ruby's shooting of Oswald was \"a planned event.\" In a declassified FBI memo written by J. Edgar Hoover from the day of Oswald's shooting, he reported that the night before Oswald's death, the FBI in Dallas received a call from \"a man talking in a calm voice and saying he was a member of a committee organized to kill Oswald\". The FBI called the chief of Dallas police both at that time and the morning after to ensure Oswald would be kept safe. Hoover adds that \"however, this was not done\".\nSome critics point to eyewitness testimony which seem to contradict the official claim that Ruby was at home until 10:30\u00a0a.m. on November 24 and instead seem to indicate that Ruby was around the police Headquarters asking about Oswald's transfer all morning. Ruby's roommate George Senator testified that on November 24, Ruby was in his apartment until about 10:30\u00a0a.m.. However, Elnora Pitts, Ruby's cleaning lady, phoned between 8:30 and 9:00\u00a0a.m. to check it was alright for her to do her usual Sunday morning cleaning for Ruby (which she had been doing for several weeks). The man who answered claimed to be Ruby but did not sound like him, did not recognise Pitts and had no knowledge of the Sunday cleaning arrangements she had with Ruby. Johnnie Smith, of WBAP-TV, was in a TV truck outside the headquarters that morning and he said that he saw a man twice between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.; the man came to the truck to enquire about Oswald's transfer. Smith said that he recognized the man as Ruby from a picture in the paper, though he said he could not recognize him from a mugshot. WBAP cameraman Ira Walker testified that a man came up to his TV truck at just after 10:30\u00a0a.m. and enquired about Oswald's transfer. He identified the man as Ruby as did Warren Richey who was on top of the truck with his camera.\nIn his Warren Commission testimony, Detective Don Archer claimed that, after his arrest, Ruby looked him straight in the eye and said, \"Well, I intended to shoot him three times.\" Kantor wrote that Ruby's response to Archer did not suggest a spontaneous reaction, and that he implied having prior intention. On another occasion Archer also said that Ruby was agitated and sweating but when Archer informed Ruby that Oswald had died \"he became calm\" and that this struck him as \"a complete difference in behaviour from what I expected\", leading him to believe that \"his life had depended on his getting Oswald\".\nRuby's explanation for killing Oswald would be exposed \"as a fabricated legal ploy\", according to the House Select Committee on Assassinations. Ruby wrote a note to attorney Joseph Tonahill: \"Joe, you should know this. My first lawyer Tom Howard told me to say that I shot Oswald so that Caroline and Mrs. Kennedy wouldn't have to come to Dallas to testify. OK?\"\nG. Robert Blakey, who was chief counsel for the House Select Committee on Assassinations from 1977 to 1979, said: \"The most plausible explanation for the murder of Oswald by Jack Ruby was that Ruby had stalked him on behalf of organized crime, trying to reach him on at least three occasions in the forty-eight hours before he silenced him forever.\"\nRussell Moore, an acquaintance of Ruby, testified to the Commission that Ruby expressed no bitterness towards Oswald and called him \"a good looking guy,\" comparing him to the actor Paul Newman. Announcer Glen Duncan also said Ruby described Oswald as a \"fairly nice looking kid\" comparing him to Newman.\nAuthor David Scheim writes that while some described Ruby as upset over the weekend of the assassination, others said that he was not. TV newsman Vic Robertson Jr. saw Ruby at police headquarters on Friday night and said that he \"appeared to be anything but under stress or strain. He seemed happy, jovial, was joking and laughing.\" Duncan also said that Ruby \"was not grieving\" and seemed \"happy that evidence was piling up against Oswald.\"\nScheim also suggests that Ruby made a \"candid confession\" when giving testimony to the Warren Commission. During his testimony, Ruby teared up when talking about a Saturday morning eulogy for Kennedy, but after composing himself, inexplicably said, \"I must be a great actor, I tell you that.\" Ruby also remarked that \"they didn't ask me another question: 'If I loved the President so much, why wasn't I at the parade?'\" (referring to the presidential motorcade) and \"it's strange that perhaps I didn't vote for President Kennedy, or didn't vote at all, that I should build up such a great affection for him.\"\nRuby's club stripper Jada, during an interview with ABC's Paul Good, said that \"I believe [Ruby] disliked Bobby Kennedy\".\nSchiem also noted some who knew Ruby who stated that the patriotic statements which Ruby professed were quite out of character. Ruby's gambling business partner Harry Hall said \"Ruby was the type who was interested in any way to make money,\" and he also said that he \"could not conceive of Ruby doing anything out of patriotism.\" Jack Kelly had known Ruby since 1943, and he \"scoffed at the idea of a patriotic motive...\" and felt that Ruby would have killed Oswald \"for publicity [or] for money\". Ruby's friend Paul Jones also said that he doubted that Ruby \"would have become emotionally upset and killed Oswald on the spur of the moment. He felt Ruby would have done it for money.\"\nRuby's lawyers, led by Sam Houston Clinton, appealed to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals after his 1964 conviction, the highest criminal court in Texas. Ruby's lawyers argued that he could not have received a fair trial in Dallas because of the excessive publicity surrounding the case. In a taped interview with reporters in March 1965, Ruby stated: \"Everything pertaining to what's happening has never come to the surface. The world will never know the true facts of what occurred, my motive. The people who had so much to gain, and had such an ulterior motive for putting me in the position I'm in, will never let the true facts come above board to the world.\" A reporter asked, \"Are these people in very high positions, Jack?\", and he responded,\"Yes.\"\nKantor speculated in 1978 that the \"Davis\" that Ruby mentioned to Tom Howard may have been Thomas Eli Davis III, a CIA-connected mercenary.\nDallas Deputy Sheriff Al Maddox claimed: \"Ruby told me, he said, 'Well, they injected me for a cold.' He said it was cancer cells. That's what he told me, Ruby did. I said you don't believe that bullshit. He said, 'I damn sure do!' One day when I started to leave, Ruby shook hands with me and I could feel a piece of paper in his palm.\" It was a note in which Ruby claimed that he was part of a conspiracy, and that his role was to silence Oswald. Not long before Ruby died, according to an article in the London \"Sunday Times\", he told psychiatrist Werner Teuter that the assassination was \"an act of overthrowing the government\" and that he knew \"who had President Kennedy killed\". He added: \"I am doomed. I do not want to die. But I am not insane. I was framed to kill Oswald.\"\nOn March 11, 1959, FBI agent Charles W. Flynn of the Dallas Office approached Ruby to become a federal informant due to his job as a night club operator, since he \"might have knowledge of the criminal element in Dallas\". Ruby was willing to become an informant and was contacted by the FBI eight times between March 11, 1959, and October 2, 1959, but he provided no information to the Bureau; he was not paid, and contact ceased.\nScheim theorised that Mafia leaders Carlos Marcello and Santo Trafficante Jr. and organized labor leader Jimmy Hoffa ordered the assassination of Kennedy. Scheim cited in particular a 25-fold increase in the number of out-of-state telephone calls from Jack Ruby to associates of these crime bosses in the months before the assassination. According to author Vincent Bugliosi, both the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations determined that all of these calls were related to Ruby seeking help from the American Guild of Variety Artists in a matter concerning two of his competitors. The House Select Committee on Assassinations report stated that \"most of Ruby's phone calls during late 1963 were related to his labor troubles. In the light of the identity of some of the individuals with whom Ruby spoke, however, the possibility of other matters being discussed could not be dismissed.\"\nBill Bonanno, son of New York Mafia boss Joseph Bonanno, stated in \"Bound By Honor\" that he realized that certain Mafia families were involved in the JFK assassination when Ruby killed Oswald, since Bonanno was aware that Ruby was an associate of Chicago mobster Sam Giancana.\nAssociations with organized crime and gunrunning allegations.\nSome conspiracy theorists have alleged Ruby had links to organized crime. The House Select Committee on Assassinations undertook a similar investigation of Ruby in 1979, 15 years after the written report, and said that he \"had a significant number of associations and direct and indirect contacts with underworld figures\" and \"the Dallas criminal element,\" but that he was not a member of organized crime. In a memo dated to the day of Oswald's murder J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, wrote that \"We have no information on Ruby that is firm, although there are some rumors of underworld activity in Chicago\".\nRuby was said to have been acquainted with the Mafia. The HSCA said that Ruby had known Chicago mobster Sam Giancana and Joseph Campisi since 1947 and had been seen with them on many occasions. After an investigation of Joe Campisi, the HSCA found:\nWhile Campisi's technical characterization in federal law enforcement records as an organized crime member has ranged from definite to suspected to negative, it is clear that he was an associate or friend of many Dallas-based organized crime members, particularly Joseph Civello, during the time he was the head of the Dallas organization. There was no indication that Campisi had engaged in any specific organized crime-related activities.\nG. Robert Blakey, the chief counsel for the HSCA, called Campisi \"the No. 2 man in the mob in Dallas.\" He wrote in a 1993 article for \"The Washington Post\": \"It is difficult to dispute the underworld pedigree of Jack Ruby, though the Warren Commission did it in 1964. Similarly, a PBS \"Frontline\" investigation into the connections between Ruby and Dallas organized crime figures reported the following:\nIn 1963, Sam and Joe Campisi were leading figures in the Dallas underworld. Jack knew the Campisis and had been seen with them on many occasions. The Campisis were lieutenants of Carlos Marcello, the Mafia boss who had reportedly talked of killing the President.\nOn the night before Kennedy was assassinated, Ruby and Ralph Paul had dinner together at the Egyptian Lounge run by Joe and Sam Campisi. After Ruby was jailed for killing Oswald, Joe Campisi \"regularly visited\" him.\nHoward P. Willens was the third-highest official in the Department of Justice and assistant counsel to J. Lee Rankin. He helped organize the Warren Commission. Willens also outlined the Commission's investigative priorities and terminated an investigation of Ruby's Cuban related activities. An FBI report states that Willens' father had been Tony Accardo's next-door neighbor going back to 1958. In 1946, Tony Accardo allegedly asked Jack Ruby to go to Texas with Mafia associates Pat Manno and Romie Nappi to make sure that Dallas County Sheriff Steve Gutherie would acquiesce to the Mafia's expansion into Dallas.\nRuby went to see a man named Lewis McWillie in Cuba four years before the assassination. McWillie had previously run illegal gambling establishments in Texas, and Ruby considered him one of his closest friends. McWillie was supervising gambling activities at Havana's Tropicana Club when Ruby visited him in August 1959. Ruby told the Warren Commission that his August trip to Cuba was merely a social visit at the invitation of McWillie. The HSCA later concluded that Ruby \"most likely was serving as a courier for gambling interests\". The committee also found circumstantial but not conclusive evidence that \"Ruby met with Santo Trafficante Jr. in Cuba sometime in 1959.\"\nJames E. Beaird, who claimed to be a poker-playing friend of Ruby, told \"The Dallas Morning News\" and the FBI that Ruby smuggled guns and ammunition from Galveston Bay, Texas to Fidel Castro's guerrillas in Cuba in the late 1950s. Beaird said that Ruby \"was in it for the money. It wouldn't matter which side, just the one that would pay him the most.\" Beaird said that the guns were stored in a two-story house near the waterfront, and that he saw Ruby and his associates load \"many boxes of new guns, including automatic rifles and handguns\" on a 50-foot military-surplus boat. He claimed that \"each time that the boat left with guns and ammunition, Jack Ruby was on the boat.\"\nAlternatively, some conspiracy theorists have focused on Ruby's connections to the police in regards to his murder of Oswald, and dismiss his mob connections as a misdirection. Greg Parker alleged Ruby killed Oswald to seek fame, as being under immense pressure, in significant debt, and under the influence of methamphetamines.\nCultural depictions.\nOn screen, Ruby has been played by:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the co-founder of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), and founder of the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF). Randi began his career as a magician under the stage name The Amazing Randi and later chose to devote most of his time to investigating paranormal, occult, and supernatural claims. Randi retired from practicing magic at age 60, and from his foundation at 87.\nAlthough often referred to as a \"debunker\", Randi said he disliked the term's connotations and preferred to describe himself as an \"investigator\". He wrote about paranormal phenomena, skepticism, and the history of magic. He was a frequent guest on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\", famously exposing fraudulent faith healer Peter Popoff, and was occasionally featured on the television program \"\"\nBefore Randi's retirement, JREF sponsored the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, which offered a prize of $1 million to applicants who could demonstrate evidence of any paranormal, supernatural, or occult power or event under test conditions agreed to by both parties.\nEarly life.\nRandi was born on August 7, 1928, in Toronto, Canada. He was the son of Marie Alice (n\u00e9e\u00a0Paradis; 1906\u20131987) and George Randall Zwinge (1903\u20131967), an executive at Bell Telephone Company. He was of French, Danish and Austrian descent. He had a younger brother and sister. He took up magic after seeing Harry Blackstone Sr. and reading conjuring books while spending 13 months in a body cast following a bicycle accident. He confounded doctors, who expected he would never walk again. He often skipped classes, and at 17, dropped out of high school to perform as a conjurer in a carnival roadshow. He practiced as a mentalist in local nightclubs and at Toronto's Canadian National Exhibition and wrote for Montreal's tabloid press. As a teenager, he stumbled upon a church where the pastor claimed to read minds. When Randi interrupted the performance and showed the parishioners how the trick worked, the pastor's wife called the police and Randi spent four hours in a jail cell. This inspired his career as a scientific skeptic.\nIn his 20s, Randi posed as an astrologer, and to establish that they merely were doing simple tricks, he briefly wrote an astrological column in the Canadian tabloid \"Midnight\" under the name \"Zo-ran\" by simply shuffling up items from newspaper astrology columns and pasting them randomly into a column. In his 30s, Randi worked in the UK, Europe, Philippine nightclubs, and Japan. He witnessed many tricks that were presented as being supernatural. One of his earliest reported experiences was that of seeing an evangelist using a version of the \"one-ahead\" technique to convince churchgoers of his divine powers.\nCareer.\nMagician.\nAlthough defining himself as a conjuror, Randi began a career as a professional stage magician and escapologist in 1946. He initially presented himself under his real name, Randall Zwinge, which he later dropped in favor of \"The Amazing Randi\". Early in his career, he performed numerous escape acts from jail cells and safes around the world. On February 7, 1956, he appeared live on NBC's \"Today\" show, where he remained for 104 minutes in a sealed metal coffin that had been submerged in a hotel swimming pool, breaking what was said to be Harry Houdini's record of 93 minutes, though Randi called attention to the fact that he was much younger than Houdini had been when he established the original record in 1926.\nRandi was a frequent guest on the Long John Nebel program on New York City radio station WOR, and did character voices for commercials. After Nebel moved to WNBC in 1964, Randi was given Nebel's time slot on WOR, where he hosted \"The Amazing Randi Show\" until January 1966, and often had guests who defended paranormal claims, among them Randi's then-friend James W. Moseley. Randi stated that he was fired from WOR over complaints from the archbishop of New York that Randi had said on-air that \"Jesus Christ was a religious nut,\" a claim that Randi disputed.\nRandi also hosted numerous television specials and went on several world tours. As \"The Amazing Randi\" he appeared regularly on the New York-based children's television series \"Wonderama\" from 1959 to 1967. In 1970, he auditioned for a revival of the 1950s children's show \"The Magic Clown\", which showed briefly in Detroit and in Kenya, but was never picked up. In the February 2, 1974, issue of the British conjuring magazine \"Abracadabra\", Randi, in defining the community of magicians, stated: \"I know of no calling which depends so much upon mutual trust and faith as does ours.\" In the December 2003 issue of \"The Linking Ring\", the monthly publication of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, it is stated: \"Perhaps Randi's ethics are what make him Amazing\" and \"The Amazing Randi not only talks the talk, he walks the walk.\"\nDuring Alice Cooper's 1973\u20131974 Billion Dollar Babies tour, Randi performed on stage both as a mad dentist and as Cooper's executioner. He also built several of the stage props, including the guillotine. In a 1976 performance for the Canadian TV special \"World of Wizards\", Randi escaped from a straitjacket while suspended upside-down over Niagara Falls.\nRandi has been accused of actually using \"psychic powers\" to perform acts such as spoon bending. According to James Alcock, at a meeting where Randi was duplicating the performances of Uri Geller, a professor from the University at Buffalo shouted out that Randi was a fraud. Randi said: \"Yes, indeed, I'm a trickster, I'm a cheat, I'm a charlatan, that's what I do for a living. Everything I've done here was by trickery.\" The professor shouted back: \"That's not what I mean. You're a fraud because you're pretending to do these things through trickery, but you're actually using psychic powers and misleading us by not admitting it.\" A similar event involved Senator Claiborne Pell, a confirmed believer in psychic phenomena. When Randi personally demonstrated to Pell that he could reveal\u2014by simple trickery\u2014a concealed drawing that had been secretly made by the senator, Pell refused to believe that it was a trick, saying: \"I think Randi may be a psychic and doesn't realize it.\" Randi consistently denied having any paranormal powers or abilities.\nRandi was a member of the Society of American Magicians (SAM), the International Brotherhood of Magicians (IBM), and The Magic Circle in the UK, holding the rank of \"Member of the Inner Magic Circle with Gold Star.\"\nAuthor.\nRandi wrote ten books, among them \"Conjuring\" (1992), a biographical history of prominent magicians. The book is subtitled \"Being a Definitive History of the Venerable Arts of Sorcery, Prestidigitation, Wizardry, Deception, &amp; Chicanery and of the Mountebanks &amp; Scoundrels Who have Perpetrated these Subterfuges on a Bewildered Public, in short, MAGIC!\" The book's cover indicates it is by \"James Randi, Esq., A Contrite Rascal Once Dedicated to these Wicked Practices but Now Almost Totally Reformed\". The book features the most influential magicians and tells some of their history, often in the context of strange deaths and careers on the road. This work expanded on Randi's second book, \"Houdini, His Life and Art\". This illustrated work was published in 1976 and was co-authored with Bert Sugar. It focuses on the professional and private life of Houdini.\nRandi's book \"The Magic World of the Amazing Randi\" (1989) was intended as a children's introduction to magic tricks. In addition to his magic books, he wrote several educational works about paranormal and pseudoscientific claims. These include biographies of Uri Geller and Nostradamus, as well as reference material on other major paranormal figures. In 2011, he was working on \"A Magician in the Laboratory\", which recounted his application of skepticism to science. He was a member of the all-male literary banqueting club the Trap Door Spiders, which served as the basis of his friend Isaac Asimov's fictional group of mystery solvers, the Black Widowers.\nOther books by Randi include \"Flim-Flam!\" (1982), \"The Faith Healers\" (1987), \"James Randi, Psychic Investigator\" (1991), \"Test Your ESP Potential\" (1982), and \"An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural\" (1995).\nRandi was a regular contributor to \"Skeptic\" magazine, penning the \"'Twas Brillig ...\" column, and also served on its editorial board. He was a frequent contributor to \"Skeptical Inquirer\" magazine, published by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, of which he was also a fellow.\nSkeptic.\nRandi gained the international spotlight in 1972 when he publicly challenged the claims of Uri Geller. He accused Geller of being nothing more than a charlatan and a fraud who used standard magic tricks to accomplish his allegedly paranormal feats, and he presented his claims in the book \"The Truth About Uri Geller\" (1982).\nBelieving that it was important to get columnists and TV personalities to challenge Geller and others like him, Randi and CSICOP reached out in an attempt to educate them. Randi said that CSICOP had a \"very substantial influence on the printed media ... in those days.\" During this effort, Randi made contact with Johnny Carson and discovered that he was \"very much on our side. He wasn't only a comedian ... he was a great thinker.\" According to Randi, when he was on \"The Tonight Show\", Carson broke his usual protocol of not talking with guests before their entrance on stage, but instead would ask what Randi wanted to be emphasized in the interview. \"He wanted to be aware of how he could help me.\"\nIn 1973, Geller appeared on \"The Tonight Show\", and this appearance is recounted in the \"Nova\" documentary \"Secrets of the Psychics\".\nIn the documentary, Randi says that Carson \"had been a magician himself and was skeptical\" of Geller's claimed paranormal powers, so before the date of taping, Randi was asked \"to help prevent any trickery\". Per Randi's advice, the show prepared its own props without informing Geller, and did not let Geller or his staff \"anywhere near them\". When Geller joined Carson on stage, he appeared surprised that he was not going to be interviewed, but instead was expected to display his abilities using the provided articles. Geller said \"This scares me\" and \"I'm surprised because before this program your producer came and he read me at least 40 questions you were going to ask me.\" Geller was unable to display any paranormal abilities, saying \"I don't feel strong\" and expressing his displeasure at feeling like he was being \"pressed\" to perform by Carson. According to Adam Higginbotham's November 7, 2014, article in \"The New York Times\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The result was a legendary immolation, in which Geller offered up flustered excuses to his host as his abilities failed him again and again. \"I sat there for 22 minutes, humiliated,\" Geller told me, when I spoke to him in September. \"I went back to my hotel, devastated. I was about to pack up the next day and go back to Tel Aviv. I thought, That's it\u2014I'm destroyed.\"\nHowever, this appearance on \"The Tonight Show\", which Carson and Randi had orchestrated to debunk Geller's claimed abilities, backfired. According to Higginbotham:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To Geller's astonishment, he was immediately booked on \"The Merv Griffin Show\". He was on his way to becoming a paranormal superstar. \"That Johnny Carson show made Uri Geller,\" Geller said. To an enthusiastically trusting public, his failure only made his gifts seem more real: if he were performing magic tricks, they would surely work every time.\nAccording to Higginbotham, this result caused Randi to realize that much more must be done to stop Geller and those like him. So in 1976, Randi approached Ray Hyman, a psychologist who had observed the tests of Geller's ability at Stanford and thought them slipshod, and suggested they create an organization dedicated to combating pseudoscience. Later that same year, together with Martin Gardner, a \"Scientific American\" columnist whose writing had helped hone Hyman's and Randi's skepticism, they formed the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP).\nUsing donations and sales of their magazine, \"Skeptical Inquirer\", they and secular humanist philosopher Paul Kurtz took seats on the executive board, with Isaac Asimov and Carl Sagan joining as founding members. Randi travelled the world on behalf of CSICOP, becoming its public face, and according to Hyman, the face of the skeptical movement.\nAndr\u00e1s G. Pint\u00e9r, producer and co-host of the European Skeptics Podcast, called Randi the grandfather of European skepticism by virtue of Randi \"playing a role in kickstarting several European organizations.\"\nGeller sued Randi and CSICOP for $15\u00a0million in 1991 and lost. Geller's suit against CSICOP was thrown out in 1995, and he was ordered to pay $120,000 for filing a frivolous lawsuit. The legal costs Randi incurred used almost all of a $272,000 MacArthur Foundation grant awarded to Randi in 1986 for his work. Randi also dismissed Geller's claims that he was capable of the kind of psychic photography associated with the case of Ted Serios. It is a matter, Randi argued, of trick photography using a simple hand-held optical device. During the period of Geller's legal dispute, CSICOP's leadership, wanting to avoid becoming a target of Geller's litigation, demanded that Randi refrain from commenting on Geller. Randi refused and resigned, though he maintained a respectful relationship with the group, which in 2006 changed its name to the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI). In 2010, Randi was one of 16 new CSI fellows elected by its board.\nRandi went on to write many articles criticizing beliefs and claims regarding the paranormal. He also demonstrated flaws in studies suggesting the existence of paranormal phenomena; in his Project Alpha hoax, Randi successfully planted two fake psychics in a privately funded psychic research experiment.\nRandi appeared on numerous TV shows, sometimes to directly debunk the claimed abilities of fellow guests. In a 1981 appearance on \"That's My Line\", Randi appeared opposite claimed psychic James Hydrick, who said that he could move objects with his mind and appeared to demonstrate this claim on live television by turning a page in a telephone book without touching it. Randi, having determined that Hydrick was surreptitiously blowing on the book, arranged foam packaging peanuts on the table in front of the telephone book for the demonstration. This prevented Hydrick from demonstrating his abilities, which would have been exposed when the blowing moved the packaging. Randi writes that, eventually, Hydrick \"confessed everything\".\nRandi was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1986. The fellowship's five-year $272,000 grant helped support Randi's investigations of faith healers, including W. V. Grant, Ernest Angley, and Peter Popoff, whom Randi first exposed on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" in April 1986. Hearing about his investigation of Popoff, Carson invited Randi onto his show without seeing the evidence he was going to reveal. Carson appeared stunned after Randi showed a brief video segment from one of Popoff's broadcasts showing him calling out a woman in the audience, revealed personal information about her that he claimed came from God, and then performed a laying-on-of-hands healing to drive the devil from her body. Randi then replayed the video, but with some of the sound dubbed in that he and his investigating team captured during the event using a radio scanner and recorder. Their scanner had detected the radio frequency Popoff's wife Elizabeth was using backstage to broadcast directions and information to a miniature radio receiver hidden in Popoff's left ear. That information had been gathered by Popoff's assistants, who had handed out \"prayer cards\" to the audience before the show, instructing them to write down all the information Popoff would need to pray for them.\nThe news coverage generated by Randi's expos\u00e9 on \"The Tonight Show\" led to many TV stations dropping Popoff's show, eventually forcing him into bankruptcy in September 1987. However, the televangelist returned soon after with faith-healing infomercials that reportedly attracted more than $23\u00a0million in 2005 from viewers sending in money for promised healing and prosperity. The Canadian Centre for Inquiry's \"Think Again! TV\" documented one of Popoff's more recent performances before a large audience who gathered in Toronto on May 26, 2011, hoping to be saved from illness and poverty.\nIn February 1988, Randi tested the gullibility of the media by perpetrating a hoax of his own. By teaming up with Australia's \"60 Minutes\" program and by releasing a fake press package, he built up publicity for a \"spirit channeler\" named Carlos, who was actually artist Jos\u00e9 Alvarez, Randi's partner. While performing as Carlos, Alvarez was prompted by Randi using sophisticated radio equipment. According to the \"60 Minutes\" program on the Carlos hoax, \"it was claimed that Alvarez would not have had the audience he did at the Opera House (and the resulting potential sales therefrom) had the media coverage been more aggressive (and factual)\", though an analysis by \"The Skeptic\"'s Tim Mendham concluded that, while the media coverage of Alvarez's appearances was not credulous, the hoax \"at least showed that they could benefit by being a touch more sceptical\". The hoax was exposed on \"60 Minutes Australia\"; \"Carlos\" and Randi explained how they had pulled it off.\nIn his book \"The Faith Healers\", Randi wrote that his anger and relentlessness arose from compassion for the victims of fraud. Randi was also critical of Jo\u00e3o de Deus, a.k.a. \"John of God\", a self-proclaimed psychic surgeon who had received international attention. Randi observed, referring to psychic surgery, \"To any experienced conjurer, the methods by which these seeming miracles are produced are very obvious.\"\nIn 1982, Randi verified the abilities of Arthur Lintgen, a Philadelphia doctor, who was able to identify the classical music recorded on a vinyl LP solely by examining the grooves on the record. However, Lintgen did not claim to have any paranormal ability, merely knowledge of the way that the groove forms patterns on particular recordings.\nIn 1988, John Maddox, editor of the prominent science journal \"Nature\", asked Randi to join the supervision and observation of the homeopathy experiments conducted by Jacques Benveniste's team. Once Randi's stricter protocol for the experiment was in place, the positive results could not be reproduced.\nRandi stated that Daniel Dunglas Home, who could allegedly play an accordion that was locked in a cage without touching it, was caught cheating on a few occasions, but the incidents were never made public. He also stated that the actual instrument in use was a one-octave mouth organ concealed under Home's large mustache and that other one-octave mouth organs were found in Home's belongings after his death. According to Randi, author William Lindsay Gresham told Randi \"around 1960\" that he had seen these mouth organs in the Home collection at the Society for Psychical Research (SPR). Eric J. Dingwall, who catalogued Home's collection on its arrival at the SPR, does not record the presence of the mouth organs. According to Peter Lamont, the author of an extensive Home biography, \"It is unlikely Dingwall would have missed these or did not make them public.\" The fraudulent medium Henry Slade also played an accordion while held with one hand under a table. Slade and Home played the same pieces. They had at one time lived near each other in the U.S. The magician Chung Ling Soo exposed how Slade had performed the trick.\nRandi distinguished between pseudoscience and \"crackpot science\". He regarded most of parapsychology as pseudoscience because of the way in which it is approached and conducted, but nonetheless saw it as a legitimate subject that \"should be pursued\", and from which real scientific discoveries may develop. Randi regarded crackpot science as \"equally wrong\" as pseudoscience, but with no scientific pretensions.\nDespite multiple debunkings, Randi did not like to be called a \"debunker\", preferring to call himself a \"skeptic\" or an \"investigator\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;(...) if you go into a situation calling yourself a debunker then it is as if you have prejudged the topic. It's not neutral or scientific, and it can turn people against you.\nSkeptics and magicians Penn &amp; Teller credit Randi and his career as a skeptic for their own careers. During an interview at TAM! 2012, Penn stated that \"Flim-Flam!\" was an early influence on him, and said \"If not for Randi there would not be Penn &amp; Teller as we are today.\" He went on to say \"Outside of my family ... no one is more important in my life. Randi is everything to me.\"\nAt the NECSS skeptic conference in 2017, Randi was asked by George Hrab what a \"'skeptic coming of age ceremony' would look like\" and Randi talked about what it was like as a child to learn about the speed of light and how that felt like he was looking into the past. Randi stated \"More kids need to be stunned\".\nAt The Amaz!ng Meeting in 2011 (TAM 9) the Independent Investigations Group (IIG) organized a tribute to Randi. The group gathered together with other attendees, put on fake white beards, and posed for a large group photo with Randi. At the CSICon in 2017, in absence of Randi, the IIG organized another group photo with leftover beards from the 2011 photo. After Randi was sent the photo, he replied, \"I'm always very touched by any such expression. This is certainly no exception. You have my sincere gratitude. I suspect, however that a couple of those beards were fake. But I'm in a forgiving mood at the moment. I'm frankly very touched. I'll see you at the next CSICon. Thank you all.\"\nIn a 2019 \"Skeptical Inquirer\" magazine article, Harriet Hall, a friend of Randi, compares him to the fictional Albus Dumbledore. Hall describes their long white beards, flamboyant clothing, associated with a bird (Dumbledore with a phoenix and Randi with Pegasus). They both are caring and have \"immense brainpower\" and both \"can perform impressive feats of magic\". She states that Randi is one of \"major inspirations for the skeptical work I do ... He's way better than Dumbledore!\".\n\"Exploring Psychic Powers ... Live\" television show.\n\"Exploring Psychic Powers ... Live\" was a two-hour television special aired live on June 7, 1989, wherein Randi examined several people claiming psychic powers. Hosted by actor Bill Bixby, the program offered $100,000 (Randi's $10,000 prize plus $90,000 put up by the show's syndicator, LBS Communications, Inc.) to anyone who could demonstrate genuine psychic powers.\nJames Randi Educational Foundation (JREF).\nIn 1996, Randi established the James Randi Educational Foundation. Randi and his colleagues publish in JREF's blog, \"Swift\". Topics have included the interesting mathematics of the one-seventh area triangle, a classic geometric puzzle. In his weekly commentary, Randi often gave examples of what he considered the nonsense that he dealt with every day.\nBeginning in 2003, the JREF annually hosted The Amaz!ng Meeting, a gathering of scientists, skeptics, and atheists. The last meeting was in 2015, coinciding with Randi's retirement from the JREF.\n2010s.\nRandi began a series of conferences known as \"The Amazing Meeting\" (TAM) which quickly became the largest gathering of skeptics in the world, drawing audiences from Asia, Europe, South America, and the UK. It also attracted a large percentage of younger attendees. Randi was regularly featured on many podcasts, including The Skeptics Society's official podcast \"Skepticality\" and the Center for Inquiry's official podcast \"Point of Inquiry\". From September 2006 onwards, he occasionally contributed to \"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\" podcast with a column called \"Randi Speaks\". In addition, \"The Amazing Show\" was a podcast in which Randi shared various anecdotes in an interview format.\nIn 2014, Part2Filmworks released \"An Honest Liar\", a feature film documentary, written by Tyler Measom and Greg O'Toole, and directed and produced by Measom and Justin Weinstein. The film, which was funded through Kickstarter, focuses on Randi's life, his investigations, and his relationship with longtime partner Jos\u00e9 Alvarez (born Deyvi Orangel Pe\u00f1a Arteaga), to whom he was married in 2013. The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, at Toronto's Hot Docs film festival, and at the June 2014 AFI Docs Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., where it won the Audience Award for Best Feature. It also received positive reviews from critics. The film was featured on the PBS \"Independent Lens\" series, shown in the U.S. and Canada, on March 28, 2016.\nIn December 2014, Randi flew to Australia to take part in \"An Evening with James Randi\" tour, organized by Think Inc. This tour included a screening of \"An Honest Liar\" followed by a \"fireside chat\" with Randi on stage. Cities visited were Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney. MC in Adelaide was Dr. Paul Willis with Richard Saunders interviewing Randi. MC in Perth was Jake Farr-Wharton with Richard Saunders interviewing Randi. MC for Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney was Richard Saunders with Lawrence Leung interviewing Randi.\nIn 2017, Randi appeared in animated form on the website Holy Koolaid, in which he discussed the challenge of finding the balance between connecting sincerely with his audience and at the same time tricking/fooling them with an artful ruse, and indicated that this is a balance with which many magicians struggle.\nOne Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge.\nThe James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) offered a prize of US$1,000,000 to anyone able to demonstrate a supernatural ability under scientific testing criteria agreed to by both sides. Based on the paranormal challenges of John Nevil Maskelyne and Houdini, the foundation began in 1996, when Randi put up $1,000 of his own money payable to anyone who could provide objective proof of the paranormal. The prize money grew to $1,000,000, and had formal published rules. No one progressed past the preliminary test, which was set up with parameters agreed to by both Randi and the applicant. He refused to accept any challengers who might suffer serious injury or death as a result of the testing.\nOn April 1, 2007, it was ruled that only persons with an established, nationally recognized media profile and the backing of a reputable academic were allowed to apply for the challenge, in order to avoid wasting JREF resources on frivolous claimants.\nOn \"Larry King Live\", March 6, 2001, Larry King asked claimed medium Sylvia Browne if she would take the challenge and she agreed. Randi appeared with Browne on \"Larry King Live\" six months later, and she again appeared to accept his challenge; however, according to Randi, she ultimately refused to be tested, and the Randi Foundation kept a clock on its website recording the number of weeks since Browne allegedly accepted the challenge without following through, until Browne's death in November 2013.\nDuring a subsequent appearance on \"Larry King Live\" on June 5, 2001, Randi challenged Rosemary Altea, another claimed medium, to undergo testing for the million dollars, but Altea refused to address the question. Instead, Altea replied only, \"I agree with what he says, that there are many, many people who claim to be spiritual mediums, they claim to talk to the dead. There are many people, we all know this. There are cheats and charlatans everywhere.\" On January 26, 2007, Altea and Randi again appeared on the show, and Altea again refused to answer whether or not she would take the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge.\nIn October 2007, claimed psychic John Edward appeared on \"Headline Prime\", hosted by Glenn Beck. When asked if he would take \"the Amazing Randi's\" challenge, Edward responded, \"It's funny. I was on \"Larry King Live\" once, and they asked me the same question. And I made a joke [then], and I'll say the same thing here: why would I allow myself to be tested by somebody who's got an adjective as a first name?\" Beck simply allowed Edward to continue, ignoring the challenge.\nRandi asked British businessman Jim McCormick, the inventor of the bogus ADE 651 bomb detector, to take the challenge in October 2008. Randi called the ADE 651 \"a useless quack device which cannot perform any other function than separating naive persons from their money. It's a fake, a scam, a swindle, and a blatant fraud. Prove me wrong and take the million dollars.\" There was no response from McCormick. According to Iraqi investigators, the ADE 651, which was corruptly sold to the Baghdad bomb squad, was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of civilians who died as a result of terrorist bombs which were not detected at checkpoints. On April 23, 2013, McCormick was convicted of three counts of fraud at the Old Bailey in London; he was subsequently sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for his part in the ADE 651 scandal, which Randi was the first to expose.\nA public log of past participants in the Million Dollar Challenge exists. In 2015, after Randi's retirement, his foundation said the Million Dollar Challenge would no longer consider applicants unless they meet a set of minimum protocols, to reduce the amount of frivolous claims.\nLegal disputes.\nRandi was involved in a variety of legal disputes, but said that he had \"never paid even one dollar or even one cent to anyone who ever sued me.\" However, he said, he had paid out large sums to defend himself in these suits.\nUri Geller.\nRandi met magician Uri Geller in the early 1970s, and found Geller to be \"Very charming. Likable, beautiful, affectionate, genuine, forward-going, handsome\u2014everything!\" But Randi viewed Geller as a con-man, and began a long effort to expose him as a fraud. According to Randi, Geller tried to sue him several times, accusing him of libel. Geller never won, save for a ruling in a Japanese court that ordered Randi to pay Geller one-third of one per cent of what Geller had requested. This ruling was cancelled, and the matter dropped, when Geller decided to concentrate on another legal matter.\nIn May 1991, Geller sued Randi and CSICOP for $15\u00a0million on a charge of slander, after Randi told the \"International Herald Tribune\" that Geller had \"tricked even reputable scientists\" with stunts that \"are the kind that used to be on the back of cereal boxes\", referring to the old spoon-bending trick. The court dismissed the case and Geller had to settle at a cost to him of $120,000, after Randi produced a cereal box which bore instructions on how to do the spoon-bending trick. Geller's lawyer Don Katz was disbarred mid-way into this action and Geller ended up suing him. After failing to pay by the deadline imposed by the court, Geller was sanctioned an additional $20,000.\nGeller sued both Randi and CSICOP in the 1980s. CSICOP argued that the organization was not responsible for Randi's statements. The court agreed that including CSICOP was frivolous and dropped them from the action, leaving Randi to face the action alone, along with the legal costs. Geller was ordered to pay substantial damages, but only to CSICOP. \nOther cases.\nIn 1993, a jury in the U.S. District Court in Baltimore found Randi liable for defaming Eldon Byrd for calling him a child molester in a magazine story and a \"shopping market molester\" in a 1988 speech; however, the jury found that Byrd was not entitled to any monetary damages after hearing testimony that he had sexually molested and later married his sister-in-law. The jury also cleared the other defendant in the case, CSICOP.\nLate in 1996, Randi launched a libel suit against a Toronto-area psychic named Earl Gordon Curley. Curley had made multiple objectionable comments about Randi on Usenet. Despite suggesting to Randi on Usenet that Randi should sue\u2014Curley's comments implying that if Randi did not sue, then his allegations must be true\u2014Curley seemed entirely surprised when Randi actually retained Toronto's largest law firm and initiated legal proceedings. The suit was eventually dropped in 1998 when Earl Curley died at the age of 51 of \"alcohol toxicity\".\nAllison DuBois, on whose life the television series \"Medium\" was based, threatened Randi with legal action for using a photo of her from her website in his December 17, 2004, commentary without her permission. Randi removed the photo and subsequently used a caricature of DuBois when mentioning her on his site, beginning with his December 23, 2005, commentary.\nSniffex, producer of a dowsing bomb detection device, sued Randi and the JREF in 2007, and lost. Sniffex sued Randi for his comments regarding a government test in which the Sniffex device failed. The company was later investigated and charged with fraud.\nViews.\nPolitical views.\nRandi was a registered Democrat. In April 2009, he released a statement endorsing the legalization of most illegal drugs.\nRandi had been reported as a believer in Social Darwinist theories, although he denounced the ideologies and movements that formed around the theories in 2013.\nViews on religion.\nRandi's parents were members of the Anglican Church but rarely attended services. He attended Sunday school at St. Cuthbert's Church in Toronto a few times as a child, but he independently decided to stop going after receiving no answer to his request for proof of the teachings of the Church.\nIn his essay \"Why I Deny Religion, How Silly and Fantastic It Is, and Why I'm a Dedicated and Vociferous Bright\", Randi, who identified himself as an atheist, opined that many accounts in religious texts, including the virgin birth, the miracles of Jesus Christ, and the parting of the Red Sea by Moses, are not believable. Randi refers to the Virgin Mary as being \"impregnated by a ghost of some sort, and as a result produced a son who could walk on water, raise the dead, turn water into wine, and multiply loaves of bread and fishes\" and questions how Adam and Eve's family \"managed to populate the Earth without committing incest\". He wrote that, compared to the Bible, \"\"The Wizard of Oz\" is more believable. And much more fun.\"\nClarifying his view of atheism, Randi wrote \"I've said it before: there are two sorts of atheists. One sort claims that there is no deity, the other claims that there is no evidence that proves the existence of a deity; I belong to the latter group, because if I were to claim that no god exists, I would have to produce evidence to establish that claim, and I cannot. Religious persons have by far the easier position; they say they believe in a deity because that's their preference, and they've read it in a book. That's their right.\"\nIn \"An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural\" (1995), he examines various spiritual practices skeptically. Of the meditation techniques of Guru Maharaj Ji, he writes \"Only the very naive were convinced that they had been let in on some sort of celestial secret.\" In 2003, he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.\nRegarding his 2006 coronary artery bypass surgery, Randi was asked if he was tempted by religious ideas about an afterlife or if he went through it any differently than if he had been religious. Randi replied \"I allowed Daniel Dennett to speak for me\" referring to Dennett's essay \"Thank Goodness\", which Dennett wrote after a serious surgery. Summing up the essay, Randi continued:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;(...) when he was recovering in the hospital he had people coming in and saying \"Oh, thank God, you're doing this, that and the other\", and he wrote this little essay, he said \"No, never mind 'thank god' but I'll accept thank goodness. Thank the goodness of the anaesthesiologist. Thank the goodness of the nurses who empty my bedpan. Thank the goodness of the intern who sweeps the floor regularly so that I don't have to breathe too much dust. Thank the designers and makers of Dacron.\"\nAll of these things, he said, \"Yes, thank their goodness but don't thank a mythical being.\" \nAnd, essentially that's a contraction of it, rather severely, but that's the way I feel, yes.\nIn a discussion with Kendrick Frazier at CSICon 2016, Randi stated \"I think that a belief in a deity is ... an unprovable claim ... and a rather ridiculous claim. It is an easy way out to explain things to which we have no answer.\" He then summarized his current concern with religious belief as follows: \"A belief in a god is one of the most damaging things that infests humanity at this particular moment in history. It may improve, and I see signs that it may be improving, and I'll leave it at that.\"\nPersonal life and death.\nWhen Randi hosted his own radio show in the 1960s, he lived in a small house in Rumson, New Jersey, that featured a sign on the premises that read: \"Randi\u2014Charlatan\".\nIn the 1970s and 80s, Randi supported seven foster children.\nIn 1987, Randi became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Randi said that one reason he became an American citizen was an incident while he was on tour with Alice Cooper, during which the Royal Canadian Mounted Police searched the band's lockers during a performance, completely ransacking the room, but finding nothing illegal.\nIn February 2006, Randi underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. The weekly commentary updates to his Web site were made by guests while he was hospitalized. Randi recovered after his surgery and was able to help organize and attend The Amaz!ng Meeting in 2007 in Las Vegas, Nevada, his annual convention of scientists, magicians, skeptics, atheists, and freethinkers.\nRandi was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in June 2009. He had a series of small tumors removed from his intestines during laparoscopic surgery. He announced the diagnosis a week later at The Amaz!ng Meeting 7, as well as the fact that he was scheduled to begin chemotherapy in the following weeks. He also said at the conference: \"One day, I'm gonna die. That's all there is to it. Hey, it's too bad, but I've got to make room. I'm using a lot of oxygen and such\u2014I think it's good use of oxygen myself, but of course, I'm a little prejudiced on the matter.\"\nRandi underwent his final chemotherapy session in December 2009, an experience that he said was not as unpleasant as he had imagined it might be. In a video posted in April 2010, Randi stated that he had been given a clean bill of health.\nIn a 2010 blog entry, Randi came out as gay, a move he said was inspired by seeing the 2008 biographical drama film \"Milk\".\nRandi married Venezuelan artist Jos\u00e9 Alvarez (born Deyvi Orangel Pe\u00f1a Arteaga) on July 2, 2013, in Washington, D.C. In 1986, Randi met Alvarez in a Fort Lauderdale public library after he had recently moved to Florida. Alvarez, who was then known as Pe\u00f1a, had left his native land in fear of his life after being threatened for being homosexual. The alias Pe\u00f1a used, Jose Alvarez, was already an actual person in the United States. The identity confusion caused the real Alvarez some legal and financial difficulties. Pe\u00f1a was arrested for identity theft and faced deportation. They resided in Plantation, Florida.\nIn the 1993 documentary \"Secrets of the Psychics\", Randi stated, \"I've never involved myself in narcotics of any kind; I don't smoke; I don't drink, because that can easily just fuzz the edges of my rationality, fuzz the edges of my reasoning powers, and I want to be as aware as I possibly can.

He was a pioneer of naval hygiene in the Royal Navy. By conducting one of the first ever clinical trials, he developed the theory that citrus fruits cured scurvy. Lind served in the Royal Navy and then went onto private practice. In 1758 he appointed chief physician of the Royal Naval Hospital Haslar, then one of the largest hospitals in the world. While chief physician, Lind argued for the health benefits of better ventilation aboard naval ships, the improved cleanliness of sailors' bodies, clothing and bedding, and below-deck fumigation with sulphur and arsenic. He also proposed that fresh water could be obtained by distilling sea water. He retired in 1783 and was awarded a large pension by the naval commissioners. Lind made significant advancements in naval medicine that advanced the practice of preventive medicine and improved human understanding of nutrition.\nEarly life.\nLind was born on 4 October in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1716 into a family of merchants, then headed by his father, James Lind. His family were related to a number of prominent Linds in the city, including George Lind and his cousin, James Lind, also a noted physician. His mother was Margaret Smellum, daughter of a merchant and town burgess. He had an elder sister, as well as a younger brother. It is not known for certain where he attended school but he learnt Greek and Latin (some sources indicate that he may have been educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh but it is not confirmed).\nIn December 1731 he began his medical studies as an apprentice of George Langlands, a fellow of the Incorporation of Surgeons which preceded the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. His duties as apprentice including mixing chemicals and basic medicines, cleaning and general chores, dressing wounds and bleeding lesser patients. \nRoyal Navy.\nAfter some 8 years as apprentice, Lind decided to go to London to find a job in medicine and in 1739, he joined the Royal Navy, his younger brother being a junior naval officer. He was examined at the Navy Office and Surgeon's Hall and then appointed to the position of surgeon's mate. Lind spent long periods with ships on blockade and patrol in the English Channel and Atlantic Ocean during the War of the Austrian Succession. Lind served in the squadron of Nicholas Haddock who blockaded the coast of Spain in the early 1740s. This included managing the effects of a major sea epidemic of typhus that affected the fleet. Lind also served in the Mediterranean, off the coast of West Africa and in the West Indies. While at sea, alongside his normal duties, Lind made extensive records and medical observations on everything related to disease and hygiene on ships. He reported back to England on the poor hospital facilities for sick sailors in Port Mahon. \nBy 1747 he had become ship surgeon of in the Channel Fleet, and had decided to conduct an experiment on the prevention and treatment of scurvy while that ship was patrolling the Bay of Biscay. This was carried out from 20 May 1747 with twelve patients and the application of dietary supplements, that varied by subgroup, including consumption of citrus fruits, herbs, pastes, cider vinegar and other treatments, with those having consumed the citrus fruits the best treated. Shortly after his first scurvy experiment in 1748, Lind retired from active sea service with the Navy.\nLater life.\nAfter he left the Navy, Lind wrote his MD thesis on venereal diseases (entitled 'De morbis venereis localibus') and subsequently earned his degree from the University of Edinburgh Medical School. He was then granted a licence from the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh to practise in Edinburgh. He then practised privately as a physician in Edinburgh. Alongside his private practice, Lind studied and gathered extensive research on the topic of scurvy and published his first treatise on Scurvy in 1753 with the Scottish publisher Kincaid and Donaldson in Edinburgh, dedicating it to Lord Anson.\nIn the summer of 1758, he was appointed chief physician of the Royal Naval Hospital Haslar at Gosport. The hospital was purpose built to be the primary medical facility for the Royal Navy and had opened officially just over four years earlier, with Lind appointed to as the second holder of the chief physician's post. It is believed that Lord Anson had directly sponsored him for the role and it came with a salary of 200 pounds a year. The position was largely administrative in nature and involved overall responsibility for on average 1,500 patients on the site on a given day. Lind reported directly to the Sick and Hurt Board Commissioners of the Admiralty. In his first two years as chief physician, Lind record 5,735 patients in the hospital, with 1,146 showing signs of scurvy which he ordered treated, conducting research and testing effective remedies while in his role. Lind was able to use his time at Haslar to produce new editions of his great works on scurvy, naval hygiene and tropical medicine.\nLind retired in 1783 and was awarded a large pension by the naval commissioners, with it being recorded this was an unusual arrangement but commensurate with his long medical service. His son John succeeded him as chief physician. In 1783, alongside his cousin, he was one of the founding members of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\nDeath.\nLind died at Gosport in Hampshire on 13 July 1794. He was buried in St Mary's Parish Churchyard in Portchester.\nFamily.\nLind married Isabella Dickie and had two sons, John and James. In 1773 he was living on Princes Street in a brand-new house facing Edinburgh Castle.\nJohn (1751\u20131794), his elder son, studied medicine at St Andrews University and graduated in 1777, then succeeded his father as chief physician at Haslar Hospital in 1783. James (1765\u20131823), also embarked on a career with the British navy. His cousin was James Lind (1736\u20131812).\nJames rose to the rank of post-captain, and was notable for his role in the Battle of Vizagapatam in the Bay of Bengal in 1804, for which he was knighted.\nResearch, writings and Legacy.\nPrevention and cure of scurvy.\nScurvy is a disease caused by a vitamin C deficiency, but in Lind's day, the concept of vitamins was unknown. Vitamin C is necessary for healthy connective tissue. In 1740 the catastrophic result of then-Commodore George Anson's circumnavigation attracted much attention in Europe; out of 1900 men, 1400 died, most of them allegedly from scurvy. According to Lind, scurvy caused more deaths in the British fleets than French and Spanish arms.\nSince antiquity in some parts of the world, and since the 17th century in England, it had been known that citrus fruit had an antiscorbutic effect. John Woodall (1570\u20131643), an English military surgeon of the British East India Company recommended them but their use did not become widespread. John Fryer (1650\u20131733) too noted in 1698 the value of citrus fruits in curing sailors of scurvy. Although Lind was not the first to suggest citrus as a cure for scurvy, he was the first to study its effect by a systematic experiment in 1747. It was one of the first reported, controlled, clinical experiments in history, particularly because of its use of control groups.\nLind thought that scurvy was due to putrefaction of the body that could be helped by acids, so he included an acidic dietary supplement in the experiment. This began after two months at sea when the ship was afflicted with scurvy. He divided twelve scorbutic sailors into six groups of two. They all received the same diet, but in addition group one was given a quart of cider daily, group two twenty-five drops of elixir of vitriol (sulfuric acid), group three six spoonfuls of vinegar, group four half a pint of seawater, group five two oranges and one lemon, and the last group a spicy paste plus a drink of barley water. The treatment of group five stopped after six days when they ran out of fruit, but by that time one sailor was fit for duty while the other had almost recovered. Apart from that, only group one showed any effect from its treatment.\nIn 1753, he published \"A treatise of the scurvy\", that was mostly ignored. When James Cook went on his first voyage he carried wort (0.1\u00a0mg vitamin C per 100\u00a0g), sauerkraut (10\u201315\u00a0mg per 100\u00a0g) and a syrup, or \"rob\", of oranges and lemons (the juice contains 40\u201360\u00a0mg of vitamin C per 100\u00a0g) as antiscorbutics, but only the results of the trials on wort were published. In 1762 Lind's second publication appeared, being \"An Essay on the most effectual means of preserving the health of seamen\" appeared. In it he recommended growing salad\u2014i.e. watercress (43\u00a0mg vitamin C per 100\u00a0g)\u2014on wet blankets. This was put into practice, and in the winter of 1775 the British Army in North America was supplied with mustard and cress seeds. However Lind, like most of the medical profession, believed that scurvy came from ill-digested and putrefying food within the body, bad water, excessive work, and living in a damp atmosphere that prevented healthful perspiration. Thus, while he recognised the benefits of citrus fruit (although he weakened the effect by switching to a boiled concentrate or \"rob\", in which the boiling process destroys vitamin C), he never advocated citrus juice as a single solution. He believed that scurvy had multiple causes which therefore required multiple remedies.\nThe medical establishment ashore continued to believe that scurvy was a disease of putrefaction, curable by the administration of elixir of vitriol, infusions of wort and other remedies designed to 'ginger up' the system. It could not account for the effect of citrus fruits and so dismissed the evidence of them as unproven and anecdotal. In the Navy however, experience had convinced many officers and surgeons that citrus juices provided the answer to scurvy, even if the reason was unknown. Gilbert Blane and Thomas Trotter also naval physicians expanded on Lind's research, advocating for the need for citrus fruits and vegetables to be issued to ship's crew. On the insistence of senior officers, led by Rear Admiral Alan Gardner in 1794, lemon juice was issued on board the \"Suffolk\" on a twenty-three-week, non-stop voyage to India. The daily ration of two-thirds of an ounce mixed in grog contained just about the minimum daily intake of 10\u00a0mg vitamin C. There was no serious outbreak of scurvy. This resulted in widespread demand for lemon juice, backed by the Sick and Hurt Board whose numbers had recently been augmented by two practical naval surgeons who knew of Lind's experiments with citrus. The following year, the Admiralty accepted the Board's recommendation that lemon juice be issued routinely to the whole fleet. Another Scot, Archibald Menzies, brought citrus plants to Kealakekua Bay in Hawaii on the Vancouver Expedition, to help the Navy re-supply in the Pacific. This was not the end of scurvy in the Navy, as lemon juice was at first in such short supply that it could only be used in home waters under the direction of surgeons, rather than as a preventative. Only after 1800 did the supply increase so that, at the insistence of Admiral Lord St Vincent, it began to be issued generally.\nPrevention of typhus.\nLind noticed that typhus disappeared from the top floor of his hospital, where patients were bathed and given clean clothes and bedding. However, incidence was very high on the lower floors where such measures were not in place. Lind recommended that sailors be stripped, shaved, scrubbed, and issued clean clothes and bedding regularly. Thereafter, British seamen did not suffer from typhus, giving the British navy a significant advantage over the French. He published two papers on fevers and infection in 1763.\nFresh water from the sea.\nIn the 18th century ships took along water in casks, as well as other drinks such as beer, spirits, cordial and milk in casks. According to the \"Regulations and Instructions relating to His Majesty's Service at Sea\", which had been published in 1733 by the Admiralty, sailors were entitled to a gallon of weak beer daily (5/6 of a British gallon, equivalent to the modern American gallon or slightly more than three and a half litres). As the beer had been boiled in the brewing process, it was reasonably free from bacteria and lasted for months, unlike water. In the Mediterranean, wine was also issued, often fortified with brandy. A typical frigate with 240 men, with stores for four months, carried more than one hundred tons of drinkable liquid. Water quality depended on its source, the condition of casks and for how long it had been kept. The longer the voyage, particularly in a warmer climate would see water become stagnant and in many cases unusable. Furthermore when water was scarce, it was rationed and rain collected with spread sails. Although fresh water was obtained when possible \"en voyage\" at local harbours and beaches, watering places were not always potable and in some places near the sea, were marshy or contaminated with salt, and in the tropics infested with malaria. For this reason, Lind, as well as others had long established attempts to distil fresh water from salt water. In 1759, Lind discovered that steam from heated salt water was fresh and capable for use on ships. He trialled a variety of methods but eventually perfected a conventional plant involving a tea-kettle, musket barrel and cask that allowed one gallon of fresh water to be made every three hours using a small heat source. In 1762, his method was proposed formally before the Royal Society in London and subsequently published in March 1763 on instruction of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty for use at sea. Fresh water was distilled on some ships using his method (including on the circumnavigation of HMS Dolphin om 1768) but it was not until later adaptations by others (especially with steam power) that distillation was possible on a useful scale for a whole ship.\nTropical disease.\nLind's final work was published in 1768; the \"Essay on Diseases Incidental to Europeans in Hot Climates, with the Method of Preventing their fatal Consequences.\" It was a work on the symptoms and treatments of tropical disease, but was not specific to naval medicine and served more as a general text for doctors and British emigrants. The \"Essay\" was used as a medical text in Britain for fifty years following publication. Seven editions were printed, including two after Lind's death.\nRecognition.\nLind's is one of twenty-three names on the Frieze of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine building in Keppel Street, London. Names were selected by a committee of unknown constitution who deemed them to be pioneers in public health and tropical medicine. At University of Edinburgh Medical School there is the unveiled in 1953, funded by citrus growers of California and Arizona. \nThe James Lind Alliance is named after him. \nThe James Lind Library is a not-for-profit, open-access electronic library on medical treatment, funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is best known for his \"Asian Saga\" novels, a number of which have had television and film adaptations. \nClavell also wrote such screenplays as those for \"The Fly\" (1958), based on the short story by George Langelaan, and \"The Great Escape\" (1963), based on the personal account of Paul Brickhill. He directed the popular 1967 film \"To Sir, with Love\", for which he also wrote the script. \nDuring his war service, Clavell was a prisoner-of-war to the Imperial Japan at Changi Prison, which formed the basis of his semi-autobiographical novel \"King Rat\" (1962) and its 1965 film adaptation.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Sydney, Australia, Clavell was the son of Commander Richard Charles Clavell (d. 23 June 1945), a Royal Navy officer who was stationed in Australia with the Royal Australian Navy from 1920 to 1922. (Richard Clavell's father was Major R.K. Clavell.) Richard Clavell was posted back to England when James was nine months old. Clavell was educated at The Portsmouth Grammar School.\nWorld War II.\nIn 1940, Clavell joined the Royal Artillery, and received an emergency Regular Army commission as a second lieutenant on 10 May 1941. Though trained for desert warfare, after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 he was sent to Singapore to fight the Japanese. The ship taking his unit was sunk en route to Singapore, and the survivors were picked up by a Dutch boat fleeing to India. The commander, described by Clavell years later as a \"total twit\", insisted that they be dropped off at the nearest port to fight the war despite having no weapons.\nImprisoned in Changi.\nShot in the face, he was captured in Java in 1942 and sent to a local Japanese prisoner of war camp. Later, he was transferred to Changi Prison in Singapore.\nIn 1981, Clavell recounted:\nChangi became my university instead of my prison. Among the inmates there were experts in all walks of life\u2014the high and the low roads. I studied and absorbed everything I could from physics to counterfeiting, but most of all I learned the art of surviving, the most important course of all.\nPrisoners were fed a quarter of a pound () of rice per day, one egg per week and occasional vegetables. Clavell believed that if atomic bombs had not been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki he would not have survived the war.\nClavell did not talk about his wartime experiences with anyone, even his wife, for 15 years after the war. For a time he carried a can of sardines in his pocket at all times and fought an urge to forage for food in rubbish bins. He also experienced bad dreams and a nervous stomach kept him awake at night.\nPost-war career.\nAfter the war, Clavell was promoted to war-substantive lieutenant, with effect from 1\u00a0August 1942, and to temporary captain on 10\u00a0June 1946, A motorcycle crash, however, ended his military career. On 20 July 1948, he was officially discharged from the army on account of disability, leaving with the honorary rank of captain. He enrolled with the University of Birmingham, where he met April Stride, an actress, whom he married in February 1949 (date of marriage sometimes given as 1951). He would visit her on the film sets where she was working and began to be interested in becoming a film director.\nEarly work on films.\nClavell entered the film industry via distribution and worked at that in England for a number of years. He tried to get into producing but had no luck, so he started writing screenplays. In 1954 he moved to New York, then to Hollywood. While trying to break into screenwriting, he paid the bills working as a carpenter.\nIn 1956, he sold a script about pilots to RKO, \"Far Alert\". The same year Michael Pate bought a story of his, \"Forbidden Territory\", for filming.\nNeither was filmed but \"Far Alert\" kept being sold and re-sold. \"In 18 months it brought in $87,000\", he later said. \"We kept getting paid for writing it and rewriting it as it went from one studio to another. It was wonderful.\" It was later sold to Fox where it attracted the attention of Robert L. Lippert, who hired Clavell to write the science-fiction horror movie \"The Fly\" (1958). This became a hit and launched Clavell as a screenwriter.\nHe wrote \"Watusi\" (1959) for director Kurt Neumann, who had also made \"The Fly\".\nClavell wrote \"Five Gates to Hell\" (1959) for Lippert, and when they could not find a suitable director, Clavell was given the job.\nParamount hired Clavell to write a film about the \"Bounty\" mutineers. It ended up not being made, nor was a proposed movie about Francis Gary Powers. Clavell did write, produce, and direct a Western at Paramount, \"Walk Like a Dragon\" (1960).\nIn 1959, Clavell wrote \"Moon Landing\" and \"First Woman in the Moon\", two episodes of \"Men into Space\", a \"day after tomorrow\"-style science fiction drama, which depicted, in realistic terms, the (at the time) near future of space exploration.\nIn 1960, Clavell wrote a Broadway show with John Sturges, \"White Alice\", a thriller set in the Arctic. It was never produced. \nEarly prose and screenplay work.\nIn 1960, the Writers Guild went on strike, meaning Clavell was unable to work. He decided to write a novel, \"King Rat\", based on his time at Changi. It took him three months and several more months after that to rework it. The book was published in 1962 and sold well. It was turned into a film in 1965.\nIn August 1960 Clavell announced he would set up his own production company, Cee Productions, to make three films: \"Unwanted\" from a novel by James Lindsay, \"Kingdom of the Mad\" and \"Earthquake\". None were made. The following year Clavell announced Cee Productions would make the films \"King Rat\", \"White Alice\" and \"No Hands on the Clock\".\nIn 1962, Clavell signed a multi picture contract with a Canadian company to produce and direct two films there, \"Circle of Greed\" and \"The Sweet and the Bitter\". Only the second was made and it was not released until 1967.\nClavell wrote scripts for the war films \"The Great Escape\" (1963) and \"633 Squadron\" (1964).\nHe wrote a short story, \"The Children's Story\" (1963), and the script for \"The Satan Bug\" (1965), directed by John Sturges, who had made \"The Great Escape\". He also wrote \"Richard Sahib\" for Sturges which was never made.\nClavell wanted to write a second novel because \"that separates the men from the boys\". The money from \"King Rat\" enabled him to spend two years researching and then writing what became \"Tai-Pan\" (1966). It was a huge best-seller, and Clavell sold the film rights for a sizeable amount (although the film would not be made until 1986).\nLeading film director.\nClavell returned to filmmaking. He wrote, produced and directed \"To Sir, with Love\" (1967), featuring Sidney Poitier and based on E. R. Braithwaite's semiautobiographical 1959 book. It was a huge critical and commercial success.\nClavell was now in much demand as a filmmaker. He produced and directed \"Where's Jack?\" (1969), a highwayman film which was a commercial failure. So too was an epic film about the Thirty Years' War, \"The Last Valley\" (1971).\nCareer as novelist.\nClavell returned to novel writing, which was the focus of the remainder of his career. He spent three years researching and writing \"Sh\u014dgun\" (1975), about an Englishman who becomes a samurai in feudal Japan. It was another massive best-seller. Clavell was heavily involved in the 1980 miniseries which starred Richard Chamberlain and achieved huge ratings.\nIn the late 1970s he spent three years researching and writing his fourth novel, \"Noble House\" (1981), set in Hong Kong in 1963. It was another best-seller and was turned into a miniseries in 1986.\nClavell briefly returned to filmmaking and directed a thirty-minute adaptation of his novelette \"The Children's Story\". He was meant to do a sequel to \"Sh\u014dgun\" but instead wrote a novel about the 1979 revolution in Iran, \"Whirlwind\" (1986).\nClavell eventually returned to the \"Sh\u014dgun\" sequel, writing \"Gai-Jin\" (1993). This was his last completed novel.\nNovelist.\n\"The New York Times\" said that \"Clavell has a gift. It may be something that cannot be taught or earned. He breathes narrative ... He writes in the oldest and grandest tradition that fiction knows\". His first novel, \"King Rat\" (1962), was a semi-fictional account of his prison experiences at Changi. When the book was published it became an immediate best-seller, and three years later it was adapted as a movie. His next novel, \"Tai-Pan\" (1966), was a fictional account of Jardine Matheson's successful career in Hong Kong, as told via the character who was to become Clavell's heroic archetype, Dirk Struan. Struan's descendants were characters in almost all of his following books. \"Tai-Pan\" was adapted as a movie in 1986.\nClavell's third novel, \"Sh\u014dgun\" (1975), is set in 17th-century Japan, and it tells the story of a shipwrecked English navigator in Japan, based on that of William Adams. When the story was made into a TV miniseries in 1980, produced by Clavell, it became the second-highest-rated miniseries in history (after \"Roots\") with an audience of more than 120 million. A second 10-episode production of the epic was released in 2024 by FX on Hulu and FX. It set a new record as the most awarded single season of television in Emmy history, and won the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series.\nClavell's fourth novel, \"Noble House\" (1981), became a best-seller that year and was adapted into a TV miniseries in 1988.\nFollowing the success of \"Noble House\", Clavell wrote \"Thrump-o-moto\" (1985), \"Whirlwind\" (1986) and \"Gai-Jin\" (1993).\nPeter Marlowe.\nPeter Marlowe is Clavell's author surrogate and a character of the novels \"King Rat\" and \"Noble House\" (1981); he is also mentioned once (as a friend of Andrew Gavallan's) in \"Whirlwind\" (1986). Featured most prominently in \"King Rat\", Marlowe is an English prisoner of war in Changi Prison during World War II. In \"Noble House\", set two decades later, he is a novelist researching a book about Hong Kong. Marlowe's ancestors are also mentioned in other Clavell novels.\nIn \"Noble House\" Marlowe is mentioned as having written a novel about Changi which, although fictionalised, is based on real events (like those in \"King Rat\"). When asked which character was based on him, Marlowe answers, \"Perhaps I'm not there at all\", although in a later scene, he admits he was \"the hero, of course\".\nPolitics and later life.\nIn 1962, Clavell moved to Vancouver, Canada, with his family joining him the following year. Although he became a naturalised citizen of the United States in 1963, he and April remained in Vancouver and raised their daughters there. Politically, he was said to have been an ardent individualist and proponent of \"laissez-faire\" capitalism, as many of his books' heroes exemplify. Clavell admired Ayn Rand, founder of the Objectivist school of philosophy, and in 1981 he sent her a copy of \"Noble House\" inscribed: \"This is for Ayn Rand\u2014one of the real, true talents on this earth for which many, many thanks. James C, New York, 2 September 81.\" \nIn 1972, Clavell moved to Switzerland. Although he and his wife primarily based themselves there, they also maintained homes in Austria, Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat on the French Riviera, the United States, and United Kingdom. Between 1970 and 1990, Clavell owned Fredley Manor near Mickleham, located in Surrey in South East England.\nPersonal life.\nClavell had three children. He and his wife had two daughters, Michaela and Holly. Clavell had an affair with Caroline Naylen Barrett, who was born in Tokyo to a Japanese mother and an American G.I. father. They had a daughter, Petra Barrett Brando-Corval, born in 1972. Barrett, the longtime personal assistant and later girlfriend of Marlon Brando, raised Petra in England; Brando legally adopted Petra in 1981. She lives in London with her husband Russel Anton Fischer, a film producer.\nDeath and legacy.\nIn 1994, Clavell died in Switzerland from a stroke while suffering from cancer. He was 72. \nAfter sponsorship by his widow, the library and archive of the Royal Artillery Museum at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, in southeast London, was renamed the James Clavell Library in his honour. The library was later closed pending the opening of a new facility in Salisbury, Wiltshire; however, James Clavell Square on the Royal Arsenal development on Woolwich riverside remains.\nBibliography.\nNovels.\nThe \"Asian Saga\" consists of six novels:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At a time when the standard treatments for psychosis were electroconvulsive therapy and lobotomy, lithium had the distinction of being the first effective medication available to treat a mental illness.\nEarly life.\nJohn Cade was born in Murtoa, in the Wimmera region of Victoria, Australia. John's father David was Murtoa's general practitioner. Ellen, John's mother, and younger brothers David and Frank completed the family. When John was a small boy, his father left for World War I and served in Gallipoli and France. On return from the war, his father suffered from 'war-weariness' and had difficulty in continuing in general practice. Therefore, his father sold the practice and accepted a position with the Mental Hygiene Department. Over the next 25 years, Dr Cade Sr became medical superintendent at several Victorian mental hospitals, namely Sunbury, Beechworth and Mont Park. John and his brothers spent many of their younger years living within the grounds of these institutions, which had a great bearing on John's later deep understanding of the needs of the mentally ill. John was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne, matriculating in 1928. He then studied medicine at the University of Melbourne, graduating at the age of 21 years with honours in all subjects. He became a House Officer at St Vincent's Hospital and then Royal Children's Hospital before becoming severely ill with bilateral pneumococcal pneumonia. While he was convalescing, John fell in love with one of his nurses, Jean. They married in 1937.\nWorld War II.\nLike his father before him, Cade left his young family to fight for Australia in the Armed Forces in World War II. Cade was appointed captain, Australian Army Medical Corps, A.I.F., on 1 July 1940 and posted to the 2nd/9th Field Ambulance. Although trained as a psychiatrist, Dr. Cade served as a surgeon and departed for Singapore in 1941 on . He was promoted to major in September 1941. After the Fall of Singapore to Japan, he became a prisoner of war at Changi Prison from February 1942 to September 1945. During his imprisonment, he reportedly would observe some fellow inmates having strange, vacillating behaviour. He thought perhaps a toxin was affecting their brains and when it was eliminated through their urine, they lost their symptoms.\nDiscovery of the effect of lithium on mania.\nAfter the war, Cade recuperated very briefly in Heidelberg Hospital, then took up a position at Bundoora Repatriation Mental Hospital in Melbourne. It was at an unused pantry in Bundoora that he conducted crude experiments which led to the discovery of lithium as a treatment of bipolar disorder. Since he had no sophisticated analytical equipment these experiments mostly consisted of injecting urine from mentally ill patients into the abdomen of guinea pigs. His early experiments suggested to him that the urine from manic patients was more toxic. There are 2 toxic substances in urine: urea and uric acid. He found urea was the same in both ill and healthy people. He started to work on uric acid. In order to do that, he made artificial solutions of uric acid. To make up different strengths of uric acid he needed to convert it into a substance that he could more easily manipulate. On its own uric acid would not dissolve in water. Then, in an effort to increase the water solubility of uric acid, lithium was added to make a solution of lithium urate. Cade found that in the guinea pigs injected with lithium carbonate solution, as a control solution, the guinea pigs were more restful. His use of careful controls in his experiments revealed that the lithium-ion had a calming effect by itself, but even this finding may have been caused by the toxic effects of an excessive dose of lithium. After ingesting lithium himself to ensure its safety in humans, Cade began a small-scale trial of lithium citrate and/or lithium carbonate on some of his patients diagnosed with mania, dementia pr\u00e6cox or melancholia, with outstanding results. The calming effect was so robust that Cade speculated that mania was caused by a deficiency in lithium. He published these findings in the Medical Journal of Australia in a paper entitled 'Lithium salts in the treatment of psychotic excitement', published in 1949.\nWhile Cade's results appeared highly promising, side effects of lithium in some cases led to non-compliance. The toxicity of lithium led to several deaths of patients undergoing lithium treatment. The problem of toxicity was greatly reduced when suitable tests were developed to measure the lithium level in the blood. Moreover, as a naturally occurring chemical, lithium salt could not be patented, meaning that its manufacturing and sales were not considered commercially viable. These factors prevented its widespread adoption in psychiatry for some years, particularly in the United States, where its use was banned until 1970.\nRoyal Park and RANZCP.\nIn 1952 Cade was appointed Superintendent and Dean of the clinical school at Royal Park Hospital. Two years later, at the request of the Mental Hygiene Authority which was planning to remodel Royal Park, he visited Britain for six months to inspect psychiatric institutions. On his return, he introduced modern facilities and replaced the rather authoritarian approach to patient care with a lot more personal and informal style that included group therapy. Concerned at the number of alcohol-related cases, he supported voluntary admission to aid early detection and later proposed the use of large doses of thiamine in the treatment of alcoholism. Cade served as the Superintendent at Royal Park until his retirement in 1977.\nHe served as the federal president of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists in 1969\u201370, and also as the president for its Victoria branch from 1963 until his death in 1980. In the end, Dr. Cade's discovery did receive widespread acknowledgements and praise. For his contribution to psychiatry, he was awarded a Kittay International Award in 1974 (with Mogens Schou from Denmark), and he was invited to be a Distinguished Fellow of the American College of Psychiatrists. In 1976, Cade was one of the first to be made an Officer of the Order of Australia. Dr. Cade remained humble about his chance discovery, describing himself as merely a gold prospector who happened to find a nugget. Finally, in July 2004, the Medical Journal of Australia reported that Cade's 1949 article, \"Lithium salts in the treatment of psychotic excitement\", was the number one most cited MJA article.\nLegacy.\nJohn Cade died of oesophageal cancer at Fitzroy on 16 November 1980, and is buried at Yan Yean Cemetery in Whittlesea. Recognition of Cade's pioneering work continued after his death. The Adult Acute unit at Royal Park Hospital was named the \"John Cade Unit\" in recognition of Cade's long service to the hospital. After Royal Park's closure, the newly opened Adult Acute Psychiatric Unit at Royal Melbourne Hospital was named \"John Cade Adult Acute Inpatient Unit\". In 1980 the first John Cade memorial lecture was delivered by Mogens Schou at the congress in Jerusalem of the Collegian International Psychopharmacologium. In 2013 the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) offered two $750 000 per annum fellowships for mental health research, entitled the \"NHMRC John Cade Fellowship in Mental Health Research\". The Fellowship recipients were Professor Helen Christensen of the University of New South Wales and Professor John McGrath of The University of Queensland. The RANZCP awards The John Cade Memorial Medal to a final year Victorian medical student following a special clinical examination at Monash University or the University of Melbourne each year. The Faculty of Medicine at University of Melbourne also awards the John Cade Memorial Prize.\nTroubled Minds.\nIn 2004, Film Australia and SBS screened the documentary \"Troubled Minds \u2013 The Lithium Revolution\", a 60-minute documentary portraying John Cade's discovery of the use of Lithium in mental illness. The documentary received international recognition, winning the main prize at the International Vega Awards for Excellence in Scientific Broadcasting.\n\"Troubled Minds\" was also recognised locally with writer/director Dennis K. Smith winning the AWGIE Award for Best Documentary.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He had seven brothers and sisters. His exact birthplace is not sure, other candidates are Puffendorf (today part of Baesweiler) and Linnich. In the past, historians also argued for Weert in Limburg because they confused him with Jan van der Croon, another imperial general with similar vita.\nAround 1610, he left home to become a soldier of fortune in the Walloon cavalry under Ambrogio Spinola in the Spanish Netherlands. Most likely, he fought in the War of the J\u00fclich Succession and served afterwards in the garrison of Lingen. The outbreak of the Thirty Years' War saw him moving to Bohemia in support of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II. In the spanish regiment Marradas, he fought at White Mountain in 1620. In 1622, at the taking of J\u00fclich, he won promotion to the rank of lieutenant. He also participated at the battle of Fleurus in 1622 but his military actions over the next eight years are not known. In this time, he married the Dutch woman Gertrud van Gent, mother of his eldest children Lambertine Irmgard and Johann Anton.\nHe served as an Oberstwachtmeister in a cavalry regiment in the Bavarian army in 1630. He obtained the command of a regiment, both titular and effective, in 1632, and in 1633 and 1634 laid the foundations of his reputation as a swift and fearsome leader of cavalry forays. His achievements were even more conspicuous in the great pitched Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634), after which the emperor made him a \"Freiherr\" of the Empire, and the elector of Bavaria gave him the rank of Lieutenant field marshal. About this time, he armed his regiment with the musket in addition to the sword.\nIn 1635 and 1636 Werth's forays extended into Lorraine and Luxembourg, after which he projected an expedition into the heart of France. Starting in July 1636, from the country of the lower Meuse, he raided far and wide, and even urged his commander-in-chief, Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria, to \"plant the Double Eagle on the Louvre\". Though this was not attempted. Werth's horsemen appeared at Saint-Denis before a French army of fifty thousand men at Compi\u00e8gne forced the invaders to retreat. The memory of this raid lasted long, and the name of \"Jean de Wert\" figures in folk-songs and serves as a bogey to quieten unruly children.\nIn 1637 Jean de Wert married Maria Isabella von Spaur in St. Verena, Stra\u00dfberg.\nIn 1637 Werth was once more in the Rhine valley, destroying convoys, relieving besieged towns and surprising the enemy's camps. In February 1638 he defeated the Weimar troops in an engagement at Rheinfelden, but shortly afterwards was made prisoner by Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar. His hopes of being exchanged for the Swedish field marshal Gustaf Horn were dashed when Bernhard had to deliver up his captive to the French. Jean de Wert was brought to Paris, amidst great rejoicings from the country people. He was lionized by the society of the capital, visited in prison by high ladies. So light was his captivity that he said that nothing bound him but his word of honour. His eventual release was delayed until March 1642 because the Imperial government feared to see Horn at the head of the Swedish army and would not allow an exchange.\nWhen at last Werth reappeared in the field it was as general of cavalry in the Imperial and Bavarian and Cologne services. His first campaign against the French marshal Guebriant was uneventful, but his second (1643) in which Baron Franz von Mercy was his commander-in-chief, was the Battle of Tuttlingen in which Werth was instrumental in a surprise victory. In 1644 he was in the lower Rhine country, but he returned to Mercy's headquarters in time to fight in the Battle of Freiburg. In the following year he played a decisive role in the Second Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen. Mercy was killed in this action, and Werth temporarily commanded the defeated arm until succeeded by Field-marshal Geleen. Werth was disappointed, but remained thoroughly loyal to his soldierly code of honour, and found an outlet for his anger in renewed military activity.\nIn 1647 differences arose between the Elector and the Emperor as to the allegiance due from the Bavarian troops, in which, after long hesitation, Werth, fearing that the cause of the Empire and of the Catholic religion would be ruined if the Elector resumed control of the troops, attempted to take his men over the Austrian border. But they refused to follow and, escaping with great difficulty from the Elector's vengeance, Werth found a refuge in Austria. The Emperor was grateful for his conduct in this affair, ordered the Elector to rescind his ban. The last campaign of the war (1648) was uneventful, and shortly after its close he retired to live on the estates which he had bought in the course of his career. And it was at one of these, Benatek NE of Prague in Bohemia, a gift from the emperor, that he died on 16 of January 1652. He was buried in the church of Nativity of the Virgin Mary in Ben\u00e1tky.\nLegend of Jan and Griet.\nJohann von Werth's life became a popular legend in the Rhineland and Cologne that is frequently reenacted at Karneval time:\nA poor peasant, Jan, fell in love with Griet but she wanted a wealthier partner and declined his offer of marriage. Devastated by her rejection he came upon an army recruiter and signed up to go to war. Through hard work and good fortune he rose to become a general, celebrating several victories. After taking the fort at Hermannstein he was leading his triumphant troops into Cologne through , when he saw his former love Griet selling fruit at a market. Griet was filled with regret at turning down such a successful person and exclaimed \"Jan, who would have thought it?\" to which he replied \"Griet, who would have had done it!\" and turns away.\nThe story has several variants. It has inspired many songs including one in 2001 by the rock band BAP. Jan von Werth's name has been used for centuries to name military and recreational organisations, particularly groups of mounted marksmen at Sch\u00fctzenfests and Karneval.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nAttribution:"}
{"id": "16288", "revid": "332841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16288", "title": "J\u00fcrgen Habermas", "text": "German social theorist and philosopher (born 1929)\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas ( , ; ; born 18 June 1929) is a German philosopher and social theorist in the tradition of critical theory and pragmatism. His work addresses communicative rationality and the public sphere.\nAssociated with the Frankfurt School, Habermas's work focused on the foundations of epistemology and social theory, the analysis of advanced capitalism and democracy, the rule of law in a critical social-evolutionary context, albeit within the confines of the natural law tradition, and contemporary politics, particularly German politics. Habermas's theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, emancipation, and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas is known for his work on the phenomenon of modernity, particularly with respect to the discussions of rationalization originally set forth by Max Weber. He has been influenced by American pragmatism, action theory, and poststructuralism.\nBiography.\nHabermas was born in D\u00fcsseldorf, Rhine Province, in 1929. He was born with a cleft palate and had corrective surgery twice during childhood. Habermas argues that his speech disability made him think differently about the importance of deep dependence and of communication. Until his graduation from grammar school, he grew up in a staunchly Protestant milieu in Gummersbach (near Cologne), where his grandfather Friedrich Habermas had been the director of the local seminary. His father, Ernst Habermas, was executive director of the Cologne Chamber of Industry and Commerce, who joined the Nazi Party in 1933 and advised it from 1939.\nA teenager during World War II, Habermas joined the \"Deutsches Jungvolk\", a junior section of the Hitler Youth, at his father's instigation, and rose to the rank of \"Jungvolkf\u00fchrer\" (leader), which allowed him to remain in this formation beyond the age of 14. He organised first aid training as part of medical corps service. From August 1944, his detachment waged anti-aircraft warfare against the Allied advances on the Siegfried Line. He narrowly avoided being drafted into the Wehrmacht at a closing stage of the war, shortly before the arrival of US troops near his home.\nHe studied at the universities of G\u00f6ttingen (1949/50), Zurich (1950/51), and Bonn (1951\u201354) and earned a doctorate in philosophy from Bonn in February 1954 with a dissertation written on the tension between the absolute and history in Schelling's thought, entitled \"\" (\"The Absolute and History: On the Schism in Schelling's Thought\"). His dissertation committee included Erich Rothacker and Oskar Becker, both of whom were former Nazis. Habermas later described the approach of his thesis as Heideggerian and noted that it led him to the work of young Marx via Karl L\u00f6with.\nIn the mid-1950s, Habermas worked briefly as a journalist. His 1953 article for the right-wing daily \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\" expressed outrage at the publication of Martin Heidegger's 1935 lectures (\"Introduction to Metaphysics\") that contained a reference to the \"inner truth and greatness\" of Nazism, while defending a complete separation between Heidegger's philosophy and politics. Habermas's essay \"The Dialectic of Rationalisation\" of 1954 sketched the outline for his later work, including his critical engagement with the Western Marxists.\nIn 1956, Habermas became Theodor W. Adorno's research assistant at the University of Frankfurt am Main's Institute for Social Research (IfS). From 1956 to 1959, he studied philosophy and sociology under Adorno and the fellow critical theorist Max Horkheimer at the IfS. He was involved at the time in the early anti-nuclear movement. His work and activities soon provoked strong objections from Horkheimer, who tried to block the publication of \"Student und Politik. Eine soziologische Untersuchung zum politischen Bewusstsein Frankfurter Studenten\" written by Habermas with Ludwig von Friedeburg and three others (on the grounds that it would \"encourage\" the East German Communists and \"play into the hands of the potential fascists at home\"), demanded that Adorno sack Habermas as his assistant in 1958, and made unacceptable demands for revision of his dissertation. Combined with his own belief that the Frankfurt School had become paralyzed with political skepticism and disdain for modern culture, the conflict resulted in Habermas leaving Frankfurt and finishing his habilitation in political science at the University of Marburg under the Marxist Wolfgang Abendroth. His 1961 habilitation work was entitled \"\" (published in English translation in 1989 as \"The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society\"). It is a detailed social history of the development of the bourgeois public sphere from its origins in the 18th century salons up to its transformation through the influence of capital-driven mass media. \nIn 1961, Habermas became a \"Privatdozent\" in Marburg, and\u2014in a move that was highly unusual for the German academic scene of that time\u2014he was offered the position of \"extraordinary professor\" (professor without chair) of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg (at the instigation of Hans-Georg Gadamer and Karl L\u00f6with) in 1962, which he accepted. In 1964, strongly supported by Adorno, Habermas returned to Frankfurt to take over Horkheimer's chair in philosophy and sociology, and reconciled with Horkheimer, who provided a glowing reference for him to the American Jewish Committee in 1965. The philosopher Albrecht Wellmer was Habermas's assistant in Frankfurt from 1966 to 1970.\nFollowing Adorno's death in 1969, Habermas, who had earlier declined the directorship of the Institute for Social Research, recommended Leszek Ko\u0142akowski to take up the role in the following year. When the proposal fell through due to opposition from the philosophy department, Habermas published an open letter against the institutionalisation of critical theory. He accepted the position of co-director (alongside Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker) of the Max Planck Institute for the Study of the Scientific and Technical World in Starnberg (near Munich) in 1971, and worked there until 1983, two years after the publication of his magnum opus, \"The Theory of Communicative Action\". He proclaimed his definitive break with the Frankfurt School of critical theory in a 1971 letter to Herbert Marcuse. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1984.\nIn 1983, Habermas returned to his chair at Frankfurt. In 1986, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the , which is the highest honour awarded in German research. Since retiring from Frankfurt in 1994, Habermas has continued to publish extensively. He holds the position of \"permanent visiting\" professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and \"Theodor Heuss Professor\" at The New School, New York City.\nHabermas was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award in Social Sciences of 2003. Habermas was also the 2004 Kyoto Laureate in the Arts and Philosophy section. He traveled to San Diego and on 5 March 2005, as part of the University of San Diego's Kyoto Symposium, gave a speech entitled \"The Public Role of Religion in Secular Context\", regarding the evolution of separation of church and state from neutrality to intense secularism. He received the 2005 Holberg International Memorial Prize (about \u20ac520,000). In 2007, Habermas was listed as the seventh most-cited author in the humanities (including the social sciences) by \"The Times Higher Education Guide\", ahead of Max Weber and behind Erving Goffman. Bibliometric studies demonstrate his continuing influence and increasing relevance.\nHe declared himself a supporter of Emmanuel Macron ahead of the 2017 French presidential election.\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas was the father of Rebekka Habermas (1959\u20132023), historian of German social and cultural history and professor of modern history at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.\nTeacher and mentor.\nHabermas was a famed teacher and mentor. Among his most prominent students were the pragmatic philosopher Herbert Schn\u00e4delbach (theorist of discourse distinction and rationality), the political sociologist Claus Offe (professor at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin), the social philosopher J\u00f3hann P\u00e1ll \u00c1rnason (professor at La Trobe University and chief editor of the journal \"Thesis Eleven\"), the hermeneutical theologian Hans-Herbert K\u00f6gler, the sociological theorist Hans Joas (professor at the University of Erfurt and at the University of Chicago), the theorist of societal evolution Klaus Eder, the social philosopher Axel Honneth, the political theorist David Rasmussen (professor at Boston College and chief editor of the journal \"Philosophy &amp; Social Criticism\"), the environmental ethicist Konrad Ott, the anarcho-capitalist philosopher Hans-Hermann Hoppe (who came to reject much of Habermas's thought), the American philosopher Thomas McCarthy, the co-creator of mindful inquiry in social research Jeremy J. Shapiro, the political philosopher Cristina Lafont (Harold H. and Virginia Anderson Professor of Philosophy at Northwestern University), and the assassinated Serbian prime minister Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107.\nPhilosophy and social theory.\nHabermas has constructed a comprehensive framework of philosophy and social theory drawing on a number of intellectual traditions:\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas considers his major contribution to be the development of the concept and theory of communicative reason or communicative rationality, which distinguishes itself from the rationalist tradition, by locating rationality in structures of interpersonal linguistic communication rather than in the structure of the cosmos. This social theory advances the goals of human emancipation, while maintaining an inclusive universalist moral framework. This framework rests on the argument called universal pragmatics\u2014that all speech acts have an inherent telos (the Greek word for \"purpose\")\u2014the goal of mutual understanding, and that human beings possess the communicative competence to bring about such understanding. Habermas built the framework out of the speech-act philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin and John Searle, the sociological theory of the interactional constitution of mind and self of George Herbert Mead, the theories of moral development of Jean Piaget and Lawrence Kohlberg, and the discourse ethics of his Frankfurt colleague and fellow student Karl-Otto Apel.\nHabermas's works resonate within the traditions of Kant and the Enlightenment and of democratic socialism through his emphasis on the potential for transforming the world and arriving at a more humane, just, and egalitarian society through the realization of the human potential for reason, in part through discourse ethics. While Habermas has stated that the Enlightenment is an \"unfinished project,\" he argues it should be corrected and complemented, not discarded. In this he distances himself from the Frankfurt School, criticizing it, as well as much of postmodernist thought, for excessive pessimism, radicalism, and exaggerations. It was at the Max Planck Institute in Starnberg that Habermas completed his principal work, and Gordon Finlayson has proposed to consider Habermas a member of the first-generation Starnberg school rather than second-generation Frankfurt School.\nWithin sociology, Habermas's major contribution was the development of a comprehensive theory of societal evolution and modernization focusing on the difference between communicative rationality and rationalization on one hand and strategic/instrumental rationality and rationalization on the other. This includes a critique from a communicative standpoint of the differentiation-based theory of social systems developed by Niklas Luhmann, a student of Talcott Parsons (Habermas secured Luhmann's entry into the small editorial committee for Suhrkamp Verlag's \"Theorie\" series).\nHis defence of modernity and civil society has been a source of inspiration to others, and is considered a major philosophical alternative to the varieties of poststructuralism. He has also offered an influential analysis of late capitalism.\nHabermas perceives the rationalization, humanization and democratization of society in terms of the institutionalization of the potential for rationality that is inherent in the communicative competence that is unique to the human species. Habermas contends that communicative competence has developed through the course of evolution, but in contemporary society it is often suppressed or weakened by the way in which major domains of social life, such as the market, the state, and organizations, have been given over to or taken over by strategic/instrumental rationality, so that the logic of the system supplants that of the lifeworld.\nAccording to the political anthropologist Irfan Ahmad, the influence of Max Weber on Habermas's conceptual framework, as demonstrated by the indebtedness of the 1981 \"Theory of Communicative Action\" to Weber's student Talcott Parsons, overrides that of Karl Marx. In that book, Habermas stated that the \"market is the most important example of a norm-free regulation of cooperative contexts\", which Ahmad regards as an unambiguous sign of his shift against left-wing politics. Habermas had previously distanced himself from the Hegelian Marxism of Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs, Adorno and Karl Korsch in his lectures delivered from 1973 onwards and published as \"Zur Rekonstruktion des Historischen Materialismus\" (French translation as \"Apr\u00e8s Marx\") in 1976. In a 1979 interview at Starnberg, after crediting Karl-Otto Apel with first labelling him a neo-Marxist around the time of his habilitation in 1961, Habermas commented: \"Today I value being considered a Marxist\". He added that he was \"not a Marxist in the sense of believing in Marxism as a sure-fire explanation. Still, Marxism did give me both the impetus and the analytical means to investigate the development of the relationship between democracy and capitalism\". He claimed to be \"the last Marxist\" as late as 1989.\nReconstructive science.\nHabermas introduces the concept of \"reconstructive science\" with a double purpose: to place the \"general theory of society\" between philosophy and social science and re-establish the rift between the \"great theorization\" and the \"empirical research\".\nThe model of \"rational reconstructions\" represents the main thread of the surveys about the \"structures\" of the world of life (\"culture\", \"society\" and \"personality\") and their respective \"functions\" (cultural reproductions, social integrations and socialization). For this purpose, the dialectics between \"symbolic representation\" of \"the structures subordinated to all worlds of life\" (\"internal relationships\") and the \"material reproduction\" of the social systems in their complex (\"external relationships\" between social systems and environment) has to be considered.\nThis model finds an application, above all, in the \"theory of the social evolution\", starting from the reconstruction of the necessary conditions for a phylogeny of the socio-cultural life forms (the \"hominization\") until an analysis of the development of \"social formations\", which Habermas subdivides into primitive, traditional, modern and contemporary formations.\n\"This paper is an attempt, primarily, to formalize the model of \"reconstruction of the logic of development\" of \"social formations\" summed up by Habermas through the differentiation between vital world and social systems (and, within them, through the \"rationalization of the world of life\" and the \"growth in complexity of the social systems\"). Secondly, it tries to offer some methodological clarifications about the \"explanation of the dynamics\" of \"historical processes\" and, in particular, about the \"theoretical meaning\" of the evolutional theory's propositions. Even if the German sociologist considers that the \"ex-post rational reconstructions\" and \"the models system/environment\" cannot have a complete \"historiographical application\", these certainly act as a general premise in the argumentative structure of the \"historical explanation\".\nThe public sphere.\nIn \"The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere,\" Habermas argues that prior to the 18th century, European culture had been dominated by a \"representational\" culture, where one party sought to \"represent\" itself on its audience by overwhelming its subjects. As an example of \"representational\" culture, Habermas argued that Louis XIV's Palace of Versailles was meant to show the greatness of the French state and its King by overpowering the senses of visitors to the Palace. Habermas identifies \"representational\" culture as corresponding to the feudal stage of development according to Marxist theory, arguing that the coming of the capitalist stage of development marked the appearance of (the public sphere). In the culture characterized by , there occurred a public space outside of the control by the state, where individuals exchanged views and knowledge.\nIn Habermas's view, the growth in newspapers, journals, reading clubs, Masonic lodges, and coffeehouses in 18th-century Europe, all in different ways, marked the gradual replacement of \"representational\" culture with culture. Habermas argued that the essential characteristic of the culture was its \"critical\" nature. Unlike \"representational\" culture where only one party was active and the other passive, the culture was characterized by a dialogue as individuals either met in conversation, or exchanged views via the print media. Habermas maintains that as Britain was the most liberal country in Europe, the culture of the public sphere emerged there first around 1700, and the growth of culture took place over most of the 18th century in Continental Europe. In his view, the French Revolution was in large part caused by the collapse of \"representational\" culture, and its replacement by culture. Though Habermas's main concern in \"The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere\" was to expose what he regarded as the deceptive nature of free institutions in the West, his book had a major effect on the historiography of the French Revolution.\nAccording to Habermas, a variety of factors resulted in the eventual decay of the public sphere, including the growth of a commercial mass media, which turned the critical public into a passive consumer public; and the welfare state, which merged the state with society so thoroughly that the public sphere was squeezed out. It also turned the \"public sphere\" into a site of self-interested contestation for the resources of the state rather than a space for the development of a public-minded rational consensus.\nHis most known work to date, the \"Theory of Communicative Action\" (1981), is based on an adaptation of Talcott Parsons' AGIL Paradigm. In this work, Habermas voiced criticism of the process of modernization, which he saw as inflexible direction forced through by economic and administrative rationalization. Habermas outlined how our everyday lives are penetrated by formal systems as parallel to development of the welfare state, corporate capitalism and mass consumption. These reinforcing trends rationalize public life. Disfranchisement of citizens occurs as political parties and interest groups become rationalized and representative democracy replaces participatory one. In consequence, boundaries between public and private, the individual and society, the system and the lifeworld are deteriorating. Democratic public life cannot develop where matters of public importance are not discussed by citizens. An \"ideal speech situation\" requires participants to have the same capacities of discourse, social equality and their words are not confused by ideology or other errors. In this version of the consensus theory of truth Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an ideal speech situation.\nHabermas has expressed optimism about the possibility of the revival of the public sphere. He discerns a hope for the future where the representative democracy-reliant nation-state is replaced by a deliberative democracy-reliant political organism based on the equal rights and obligations of citizens. In such a direct democracy-driven system, the activist public sphere is needed for debates on matters of public importance as well as the mechanism for that discussion to affect the decision-making process.\nHabermas versus the postmodernists.\nHabermas offered some early criticisms in an essay, \"Modernity versus Postmodernity\" (1981), which has achieved wide recognition. In that essay, Habermas raises the issue of whether, in light of the failures of the twentieth century, we \"should try to hold on to the \"intentions of the Enlightenment\", feeble as they may be, or should we declare the entire project of modernity a lost cause?\" Habermas refuses to give up on the possibility of a rational, \"scientific\" understanding of the life-world.\nHabermas has several main criticisms of postmodernism:\nKey dialogues and engagement with politics.\nPositivism dispute.\nThe positivism dispute was a political-philosophical dispute between the critical rationalists (Karl Popper, Hans Albert) and the Frankfurt School (Theodor Adorno, J\u00fcrgen Habermas) in 1961, about the methodology of the social sciences. It grew into a broad discussion within German sociology from 1961 to 1969.\nHabermas and Gadamer.\nThere is a controversy between Habermas and Hans-Georg Gadamer about limits of hermeneutics. Gadamer completed his magnum opus, \"Truth and Method\", in 1960, and engaged in his debate with Habermas over the possibility of transcending history and culture to find a truly objective position from which to critique society.\nDuring the 1960s, Gadamer supported Habermas and advocated for him to be offered a job at Heidelberg before he had completed his habilitation, despite Max Horkheimer's objections. While they both criticized positivism, a philosophical disagreement arose between them in the 1970s. This disagreement expanded the scope of Gadamer's philosophical influence. Despite fundamental agreements between them, such as starting from the hermeneutic tradition and returning to Greek practical philosophy, Habermas argued that Gadamer's emphasis on tradition and prejudice blinded him to the ideological operation of power. Habermas believed that Gadamer's approach failed to enable critical reflection on the sources of ideology in society. He accused Gadamer of endorsing a dogmatic stance toward tradition, which made it difficult to identify distortions in understanding. Gadamer countered that refusing the universal nature of hermeneutics was the more dogmatic stance because it affirmed the deception that the subject can free itself from the past.\nHabermas and Foucault.\nThere is a dispute concerning whether Michel Foucault's ideas of \"power analytics\" and \"genealogy\" or J\u00fcrgen Habermas's ideas of \"communicative rationality\" and \"discourse ethics\" provide a better critique of the nature of power in society. The debate compares and evaluates the central ideas of Habermas and Foucault as they pertain to questions of power, reason, ethics, modernity, democracy, civil society, and social action.\nHabermas and Apel.\nHabermas and Karl-Otto Apel both support a postmetaphysical, universal moral theory, but they disagree on the nature and justification of this principle. Habermas disagrees with Apel's view that the principle is a transcendental condition of human activity, while Apel asserts that it is. They each criticize the other's position. Habermas argues that Apel is too concerned with transcendental conditions, while Apel argues that Habermas doesn't value critical discourse enough.\nHabermas and Rawls.\nThere is a debate between Habermas and John Rawls. The debate centers around the question of how to do political philosophy under conditions of cultural pluralism, if the aim of political philosophy is to uncover the normative foundation of a modern liberal democracy. Habermas believes that Rawls's view is inconsistent with the idea of popular sovereignty, while Rawls argues that political legitimacy is solely a matter of sound moral reasoning or that democratic will formation has been unduly downgraded in his theory.\n\"Historikerstreit\" (historians' dispute).\nHabermas is famous as a public intellectual as well as a scholar; most notably, in the 1980s he used the popular press to attack the German historians Ernst Nolte, Michael St\u00fcrmer, Klaus Hildebrand and Andreas Hillgruber. Habermas first expressed his views on the above-mentioned historians in the \"Die Zeit\" on 11 July 1986 in a \"feuilleton\" (a type of culture and arts opinion essay in German newspapers) entitled \"A Kind of Settlement of Damages\". Habermas criticized Nolte, Hildebrand, St\u00fcrmer and Hillgruber for \"apologistic\" history writing in regard to the Nazi era, and for seeking to \"close Germany's opening to the West\" that in Habermas's view had existed since 1945.\nHabermas argued that Nolte, St\u00fcrmer, Hildebrand and Hillgruber had tried to detach Nazi rule and the Holocaust from the mainstream of German history, explain away Nazism as a reaction to Bolshevism, and partially rehabilitate the reputation of the Wehrmacht (German Army) during World War II. Habermas wrote that St\u00fcrmer was trying to create a \"vicarious religion\" in German history which, together with the work of Hillgruber, glorifying the last days of the German Army on the Eastern Front, was intended to serve as a \"kind of NATO philosophy colored with German nationalism\". About Hillgruber's statement that Adolf Hitler wanted to exterminate the Jews \"because only such a 'racial revolution' could lend permanence to the world-power status of his \"Reich\"\", Habermas wrote: \"Since Hillgruber does not use the verb in the subjunctive, one does not know whether the historian has adopted the perspective of the particulars this time too\".\nHabermas wrote: \"The unconditional opening of the Federal Republic to the political culture of the West is the greatest intellectual achievement of our postwar period; my generation should be especially proud of this. This event cannot and should not be stabilized by a kind of NATO philosophy colored with German nationalism. The opening of the Federal Republic has been achieved precisely by overcoming the ideology of Central Europe that our revisionists are trying to warm up for us with their geopolitical drumbeat about \"the old geographically central position of the Germans in Europe\" (St\u00fcrmer) and \"the reconstruction of the destroyed European Center\" (Hillgruber). The only patriotism that will not estrange us from the West is a constitutional patriotism.\"\nThe debate known as the \"Historikerstreit\" (\"Historians' Dispute\") was not at all one-sided, because Habermas was himself attacked by scholars like Joachim Fest, Hagen Schulze, Horst M\u00f6ller, Imanuel Geiss and Klaus Hildebrand. In turn, Habermas was supported by historians such as Martin Broszat, Eberhard J\u00e4ckel, Hans Mommsen, and Hans-Ulrich Wehler.\nHabermas and Derrida.\nHabermas and Jacques Derrida engaged in a series of disputes beginning in the 1980s and culminating in a mutual understanding and friendship in the late 1990s that lasted until Derrida's death in 2004. They originally came in contact when Habermas invited Derrida to speak at the University of Frankfurt am Main in 1984. The next year Habermas published \"Beyond a Temporalized Philosophy of Origins: Derrida\" in \"The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity\" in which he described Derrida's method as being unable to provide a foundation for social critique. Derrida, citing Habermas as an example, remarked that, \"those who have accused me of reducing philosophy to literature or logic to rhetoric ... have visibly and carefully avoided reading me\". After Derrida's final rebuttal in 1989 the two philosophers did not continue, but, as Derrida described it, groups in the academy \"conducted a kind of 'war', in which we ourselves never took part, either personally or directly\".\nAt the end of the 1990s, Habermas approached Derrida at a party held at an American university where both were lecturing. They then met at Paris over dinner, and participated afterwards in many joint projects. In 2000 they held a joint seminar on problems of philosophy, right, ethics, and politics at the University of Frankfurt. In December 2000, in Paris, Habermas gave a lecture entitled \"How to answer the ethical question?\" at the \"Judeities. Questions for Jacques Derrida\" conference organized by Joseph Cohen and Raphael Zagury-Orly. Following the lecture by Habermas, both thinkers engaged in a very heated debate on Heidegger and the possibility of Ethics. The conference volume was published at the Editions Galil\u00e9e (Paris) in 2002, and subsequently in English at Fordham University Press (2007).\nIn the aftermath of the 11 September attacks, Derrida and Habermas laid out their individual opinions on 9/11 and the war on terror in Giovanna Borradori's \"Philosophy in a Time of Terror: Dialogues with J\u00fcrgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida\". In early 2003, both Habermas and Derrida were very active in opposing the coming Iraq War; in a manifesto that later became the book \"Old Europe, New Europe, Core Europe\", the two called for a tighter unification of the states of the European Union in order to create a power capable of opposing American foreign policy. Derrida wrote a foreword expressing his unqualified subscription to Habermas's declaration of February 2003 (\"February 15, or, What Binds Europeans Together: Plea for a Common Foreign Policy, Beginning in Core Europe\") in the book, which was a reaction to the Bush administration's demands upon European nations for support in the coming Iraq War.\nReligious dialogue.\nHabermas's attitudes toward religion have changed throughout the years. Analyst Phillippe Portier identifies three phases in Habermas's attitude towards this social sphere: the first, in the decade of 1980, when the younger J\u00fcrgen, in the spirit of Marx, argued against religion seeing it as an \"alienating reality\" and \"control tool\"; the second phase, from the mid-1980s to the beginning of the 21st century, when he stopped discussing it and, as a secular commentator, relegated it to matters of private life; and the third, from then until now, when Habermas saw a positive social role of religion.\nIn an interview in 1999 Habermas had stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For the normative self-understanding of modernity, Christianity has functioned as more than just a precursor or catalyst. Universalistic egalitarianism, from which sprang the ideals of freedom and a collective life in solidarity, the autonomous conduct of life and emancipation, the individual morality of conscience, human rights and democracy, is the direct legacy of the Judaic ethic of justice and the Christian ethic of love. This legacy, substantially unchanged, has been the object of a continual critical reappropriation and reinterpretation. Up to this very day there is no alternative to it. And in light of the current challenges of a post-national constellation, we must draw sustenance now, as in the past, from this substance. Everything else is idle postmodern talk.\nThe original German (from the Habermas Forum website) of the disputed quotation is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Das Christentum ist f\u00fcr das normative Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis der Moderne nicht nur eine Vorl\u00e4ufergestalt oder ein Katalysator gewesen. Der egalit\u00e4re Universalismus, aus dem die Ideen von Freiheit und solidarischem Zusammenleben, von autonomer Lebensf\u00fchrung und Emanzipation, von individueller Gewissensmoral, Menschenrechten und Demokratie entsprungen sind, ist unmittelbar ein Erbe der j\u00fcdischen Gerechtigkeits- und der christlichen Liebesethik. In der Substanz unver\u00e4ndert, ist dieses Erbe immer wieder kritisch angeeignet und neu interpretiert worden. Dazu gibt es bis heute keine Alternative. Auch angesichts der aktuellen Herausforderungen einer postnationalen Konstellation zehren wir nach wie vor von dieser Substanz. Alles andere ist postmodernes Gerede.\"\u2014\u200a\nThis statement has been misquoted in a number of articles and books, where Habermas instead is quoted for saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Christianity, and nothing else, is the ultimate foundation of liberty, conscience, human rights, and democracy, the benchmarks of Western civilization. To this day, we have no other options. We continue to nourish ourselves from this source. Everything else is postmodern chatter.\nIn his book \"Zwischen Naturalismus und Religion\" (Between Naturalism and Religion, 2005), Habermas stated that the forces of religious strength, as a result of multiculturalism and immigration, are stronger than in previous decades, and, therefore, there is a need of tolerance which must be understood as a two-way street: secular people need to tolerate the role of religious people in the public square and vice versa.\nIn early 2007, Ignatius Press published a dialogue between Habermas and the then Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith of the Holy Office Joseph Ratzinger (elected as Pope Benedict XVI in 2005), entitled \"The Dialectics of Secularization\". The dialogue took place on 14 January 2004 after an invitation to both thinkers by the Catholic Academy of Bavaria in Munich. It addressed contemporary questions such as:\nIn this debate a shift of Habermas became evident\u2014in particular, his rethinking of the public role of religion. Habermas stated that he wrote as a \"methodological atheist,\" which means that when doing philosophy or social science, he presumed nothing about particular religious beliefs. Yet while writing from this perspective his evolving position towards the role of religion in society led him to some challenging questions, and as a result conceding some ground in his dialogue with the future Pope, that would seem to have consequences which further complicated the positions he holds about a communicative rational solution to the problems of modernity. Habermas believes that even for self-identified liberal thinkers, \"to exclude religious voices from the public square is highly illiberal.\"\nIn addition, Habermas has popularized the concept of \"post-secular\" society, to refer to current times in which the idea of modernity is perceived as unsuccessful and at times, morally failed, so that, rather than a stratification or separation, a new peaceful dialogue and coexistence between faith and reason must be sought to learn mutually.\nSocialist dialogue.\nHabermas has sided with other 20th-century commentators on Marx such as Hannah Arendt who have indicated concerns with the limits of totalitarian perspectives often associated with Marx's over-estimation of the emancipatory potential of the forces of production. Arendt had presented this in her book \"The Origins of Totalitarianism\" and Habermas extends this critique in his writings on functional reductionism in the life-world in his \"Lifeworld and System: A Critique of Functionalist Reason\". As Habermas states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Habermas reiterated the positions that what refuted Marx and his theory of class struggle was the \"pacification of class conflict\" by the welfare state, which had developed in the West \"since 1945\", thanks to \"a reformist relying on the instruments of Keynesian economics\". Italian philosopher and historian Domenico Losurdo criticised the main point of these claims as \"marked by the absence of a question that should be obvious:\u2014 Was the advent of the welfare state the inevitable result of a tendency inherent in capitalism? Or was it the result of political and social mobilization by the subaltern classes\u2014in the final analysis, of a class struggle? Had the German philosopher posed this question, perhaps he would have avoided assuming the permanence of the welfare state, whose precariousness and progressive dismantlement are now obvious to everyone\".\nIn 1973, Habermas noted \"the incompatibility of the imperatives that rule the capitalistic economic system with a democratic process for forming the public will\". His critique of capitalism has focused on its technocratic tendencies.\nControversy about wars.\nIn 1999, Habermas addressed the Kosovo War. Habermas defended NATO's intervention in an article for \"Die Zeit\", which stirred controversy.\nIn 2002, Habermas argued that the United States should not go to war in Iraq.\nOn 13 November 2023, Habermas and co-authors issued a statement arguing that Israel's military response to the \"extreme atrocity\" of the Hamas-led attack on Israel was \"justified in principle\". Although questions of proportionality and civilian casualties can rightly be asked about the Israeli response, the statement maintained that such critiques cannot justly attribute \"genocidal intentions\" to Israel's actions and, furthermore, should in any case not lead to antisemitism.\nEuropean Union.\nReferencing Hegel's concept of the cunning of reason, used to describe the progressive realisation of freedom in history unbeknown to individuals, Habermas has stated that the euro represents the \"cunning of economic reason\".\nDuring the European debt crisis, Habermas criticized Angela Merkel's leadership in Europe. In 2013, Habermas clashed with Wolfgang Streeck, who argued the kind of European federalism espoused by Habermas was the root of the continent's crisis.\nAwards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMajor works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n A recent analysis which underscores the aesthetic power of intersubjective communication in Habermas's theory of communicative action.\n A highly regarded interpretation in English of Habermas's earlier work, written just as Habermas was developing his full-fledged communication theory.\n A clear account of Habermas's early philosophical views.\n A recent, brief introduction to Habermas, focusing on his communication theory of society.\n Discussing Habermas's legal philosophy in the 1992 original German edition of \"Between Facts and Norms\".\n A recent and comprehensive introduction to Habermas's mature theory and its political implications both national and global."}

In 1953, he and Francis Crick co-authored in \"Nature\" proposing the double helix structure of the DNA molecule, building on research by Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling. In 1962, Watson, Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material\".\nWatson graduated from the University of Chicago in 1947 and received his doctorate from Indiana University Bloomington in 1950. After a post-doctoral year at the University of Copenhagen with Herman Kalckar and Ole Maal\u00f8e, Watson worked at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory in England, where he met his future collaborator Francis Crick. From 1956 to 1976, Watson was employed by the faculty of the Harvard University Biology Department, promoting research in molecular biology.\nFrom 1968, Watson served as the director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) in Laurel Hollow, New York, greatly expanding its level of funding and research. At CSHL, he shifted his research emphasis to the study of cancer, along with making it a world-leading research center in molecular biology. In 1994, Watson started as president and served for 10 years. He was then appointed chancellor, serving until his resignation in 2007 after making comments claiming that there is a genetic link between race and intelligence. In 2019, after the broadcast of a documentary where Watson reiterated these views on race and genetics, CSHL revoked his honorary titles and severed all ties with him.\nWatson wrote many science books, including the textbook \"Molecular Biology of the Gene\" (1965) and his bestselling book \"The Double Helix\" (1968). He made derogatory comments about Rosalind Franklin, who had been responsible for gathering data that led to the discovery of the structure of DNA, and was criticized for misogyny. Between 1988 and 1992, Watson was associated with the National Institutes of Health, helping to establish the Human Genome Project, which completed the task of mapping the human genome in 2003.\nEarly life and education.\nJames Dewey Watson was born in Chicago on April 6, 1928, the only son of Jean (n\u00e9e\u00a0Mitchell) and James D. Watson, a businessman descended mostly from colonial English immigrants to America. His maternal grandfather, Lauchlin Mitchell, a tailor, was from Glasgow, Scotland, and his maternal grandmother, Lizzie Gleason, was the child of parents from County Tipperary, Ireland. Watson's mother was a modestly religious Catholic and his father an Episcopalian who had lost his belief in God. Watson grew up Catholic, but he later described himself as \"an escapee from the Catholic religion\". Watson said, \"The luckiest thing that ever happened to me was that my father didn't believe in God.\" By age 11, Watson stopped attending mass and embraced the \"pursuit of scientific and humanistic knowledge.\"\nWatson grew up on the South Side of Chicago and attended public schools, including Horace Mann Elementary School and South Shore High School. He was fascinated with bird watching, a hobby shared with his father, so Watson considered majoring in ornithology. He appeared on \"Quiz Kids,\" a popular radio show that challenged bright youngsters to answer questions. Thanks to the liberal policy of university president Robert Hutchins, Watson enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he was awarded a tuition scholarship at age 15. Among his professors was Louis Leon Thurstone, from whom Watson learned about factor analysis, which he later referenced on his controversial views on race.\nAfter reading Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger's book \"What Is Life?\" in 1946, Watson changed his professional ambitions from the study of ornithology to genetics. Watson earned his Bachelor of Science degree in zoology from the University of Chicago the following year. In his autobiography, \"Avoid Boring People\", Watson described the University of Chicago as an \"idyllic academic institution where [he] was instilled with the capacity for critical thought and an ethical compulsion not to suffer fools who impeded his search for truth\", in contrast to his description of later experiences. In 1947, Watson left the University of Chicago to become a graduate student at Indiana University, attracted by the presence at Bloomington of the 1946 Nobel Prize winner Hermann Joseph Muller, who in crucial papers published in 1922, 1929, and in the 1930s had laid out all the basic properties of the heredity molecule that Schr\u00f6dinger presented in his 1944 book. Watson received his Doctor of Philosophy degree from Indiana University Bloomington in 1950; Salvador Luria was his doctoral advisor.\nCareer and research.\nLuria, Delbr\u00fcck, and the Phage Group.\nOriginally, Watson was drawn into molecular biology by the work of Salvador Luria. Luria eventually shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the Luria\u2013Delbr\u00fcck experiment, which concerned the nature of genetic mutations. He was part of a distributed group of researchers who were making use of the viruses that infect bacteria, called bacteriophages. He and Max Delbr\u00fcck were among the leaders of this new \"Phage Group\", an important movement of geneticists from experimental systems such as \"Drosophila\" towards microbial genetics. Early in 1948, Watson began his PhD research in Luria's laboratory at Indiana University. That spring, he met Delbr\u00fcck first in Luria's apartment and again that summer during Watson's first trip to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\nThe Phage Group was the intellectual medium where Watson became a working scientist. Importantly, the members of the Phage Group sensed that they were on the path to discovering the physical nature of the gene. In 1949, Watson took a course with Felix Haurowitz that included the conventional view of that time: that genes were proteins and able to replicate themselves. The other major molecular component of chromosomes, DNA, was widely considered to be a \"stupid tetranucleotide\", serving only a structural role to support the proteins. Even at this early time, Watson, under the influence of the Phage Group, was aware of the Avery\u2013MacLeod\u2013McCarty experiment, which suggested that DNA was the genetic molecule. Watson's research project involved using X-rays to inactivate bacterial viruses.\nWatson then went to Copenhagen University in September 1950 for a year of postdoctoral research, first heading to the laboratory of biochemist Herman Kalckar. Kalckar was interested in the enzymatic synthesis of nucleic acids, and he wanted to use phages as an experimental system. Watson wanted to explore the structure of DNA, and his interests did not coincide with Kalckar's. After working part of the year with Kalckar, Watson spent the remainder of his time in Copenhagen conducting experiments with microbial physiologist Ole Maal\u00f8e, then a member of the Phage Group.\nThe experiments, of which Watson became aware at the previous summer's Cold Spring Harbor phage conference, employed radioactive phosphate as a tracer to identify which molecular components of bacteriophage particles are responsible for infecting the host bacteria during viral entry. The intention was to determine whether protein or DNA was the genetic material, but upon consultation with Max Delbr\u00fcck, they determined that their results were inconclusive and could not specifically identify the newly labeled molecules as DNA. Watson never developed a constructive interaction with Kalckar, but he did accompany Kalckar to a meeting in Italy, where Watson saw Maurice Wilkins talk about X-ray diffraction data for DNA. Watson had become firmly convinced that DNA possessed a distinct molecular structure amenable to precise elucidation.\nIn 1951, the chemists Linus Pauling, Robert Corey and Herman Branson in California published their model of the amino acid alpha helix, a result that grew out of their efforts in X-ray crystallography and molecular model building. After obtaining some results from his phage and other experimental research conducted at Indiana University, Statens Serum Institut (Denmark), CSHL, and the California Institute of Technology, Watson now had the desire to learn to perform X-ray diffraction experiments so he could work to determine the structure of DNA. That summer, Luria met John Kendrew, and he arranged for a new postdoctoral research project for Watson in England. In 1951, Watson visited the Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn in Naples.\nIdentifying the double helix.\nIn mid-March 1953, Watson and Crick deduced the double helix structure of DNA. Crucial to their discovery were the experimental data collected at King's College London\u2014mainly by Rosalind Franklin, and for which they did not provide proper attribution. Sir Lawrence Bragg, the director of the Cavendish Laboratory (where Watson and Crick worked), made the original announcement of the discovery at a Solvay conference on proteins in Belgium on April 8, 1953; it went unreported by the press. Watson and Crick submitted a paper entitled \"\" to the scientific journal \"Nature\", which was published on April 25, 1953.\nSydney Brenner, Jack Dunitz, Dorothy Hodgkin, Leslie Orgel, and Beryl M. Oughton were some of the first people in April 1953 to see the model of the structure of DNA, constructed by Crick and Watson; at the time, they were working at Oxford University's chemistry department. All were impressed by the new DNA model, especially Brenner, who subsequently worked with Crick at Cambridge in the Cavendish Laboratory and the new Laboratory of Molecular Biology. According to the late Beryl Oughton, later Rimmer, they all travelled together in two cars once Hodgkin announced to them that they were off to Cambridge to see the model of the structure of DNA.\nThe Cambridge University student newspaper \"Varsity\" ran its own short article on the discovery on May 30, 1953. Watson subsequently presented a paper on the double-helical structure of DNA at the 18th Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Viruses in early June 1953, six weeks after the publication of the Watson and Crick paper in \"Nature\". Many at the meeting had not yet heard of the discovery. The 1953 Cold Spring Harbor Symposium was the first opportunity for many to see the model of the DNA double helix. Watson, Crick, and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for their research on the structure of nucleic acids. Rosalind Franklin had died in 1958 and was therefore ineligible for nomination. The publication of the double helix structure of DNA has been described as a turning point in science; understanding of life was fundamentally changed and the modern era of biology began.\nInteractions with Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling.\nWatson and Crick's use of DNA X-ray diffraction data collected by Rosalind Franklin and her student Raymond Gosling attracted scrutiny. It has been argued that Watson and his colleagues did not properly acknowledge Franklin for her contributions to the discovery of the double helix structure. Robert P. Crease notes that \"Such stingy behaviour may not be unknown, or even uncommon, among scientists\". Franklin's high-quality X-ray diffraction patterns of DNA were unpublished results, which Watson and Crick used without her knowledge or consent in their construction of the double helix model of DNA. Franklin's results provided estimates of the water content of DNA crystals and these results were consistent with the two sugar-phosphate backbones being on the outside of the molecule. Franklin told Crick and Watson that the backbones had to be on the outside; before then, Linus Pauling and Watson and Crick had erroneous models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards. Her identification of the space group for DNA crystals revealed to Crick that the two DNA strands were antiparallel.\nThe X-ray diffraction images collected by Gosling and Franklin provided the best evidence for the helical nature of DNA. Watson and Crick had three sources for Franklin's unpublished data:\nIn a 1954 article, Watson and Crick acknowledged that, without Franklin's data, \"the formulation of our structure would have been most unlikely, if not impossible\". In \"The Double Helix\", Watson later admitted that \"Rosy, of course, did not directly give us her data. For that matter, no one at King's realized they were in our hands\". In recent years, Watson garnered controversy in the popular and scientific press for his \"misogynist treatment\" of Franklin and his failure to properly attribute her work on DNA. According to one critic, Watson's portrayal of Franklin in \"The Double Helix\" was negative, giving the impression that she was Wilkins' assistant and was unable to interpret her own DNA data. Watson's accusation was indefensible since Franklin told Crick and Watson that the helix backbones had to be on the outside. From a 2003 piece by Brenda Maddox in \"Nature\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Other comments dismissive of \"Rosy\" in Watson's book caught the attention of the emerging women's movement in the late 1960s. \"Clearly Rosy had to go or be put in her place ... Unfortunately Maurice could not see any decent way to give Rosy the boot\". And, \"Certainly a bad way to go out into the foulness of a ... November night was to be told by a woman to refrain from venturing an opinion about a subject for which you were not trained.\"\nRobert P. Crease remarks that \"[Franklin] was close to figuring out the structure of DNA, but did not do it. The title of 'discoverer' goes to those who first fit the pieces together\". Jeremy Bernstein rejects that Franklin was a \"victim\" and states that \"[Watson and Crick] made the double-helix scheme work. It is as simple as that\". Matthew Cobb and Nathaniel C. Comfort write that \"Franklin was no victim in how the DNA double helix was solved\" but that she was \"an equal contributor to the solution of the structure\".\nA review of the correspondence from Franklin to Watson, in the archives at CSHL, revealed that the two scientists later exchanged constructive scientific correspondence. Franklin consulted with Watson on her tobacco mosaic virus RNA research. Franklin's letters were framed with the normal and unremarkable forms of address, beginning with \"Dear Jim\", and concluding with \"Best Wishes, Yours, Rosalind\". Each of the scientists published their own unique contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA in separate articles, and all of the contributors published their findings in the same volume of \"Nature\". These classic molecular biology papers are identified as: Watson J. D. and Crick F. H. C. \"A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid\". \"Nature\" 171, 737\u2013738 (1953); Wilkins M. H. F., Stokes A. R. &amp; Wilson H. R. \"Molecular Structure of Deoxypentose Nucleic Acids\". \"Nature\" 171, 738\u2013740 (1953); Franklin R. and Gosling R. G. \"Molecular Configuration in Sodium Thymonucleate\". \"Nature\" 171, 740\u2013741 (1953).\nHarvard University.\nIn 1956, Watson accepted a position in the biology department at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His work at Harvard focused on RNA and its role in the transfer of genetic information. He continued to be a member of the Harvard faculty until 1976, even though he took over the directorship of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory eight years prior.\nDuring his tenure at Harvard, Watson participated in a protest against the Vietnam War, leading a group of 12 biologists and biochemists calling for \"the immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam.\" In 1975, on the thirtieth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, Watson was one of over 2,000 scientists and engineers who spoke out against nuclear proliferation to President Gerald Ford, arguing that there was no proven method for the safe disposal of radioactive waste, and that nuclear plants were a security threat due to the possibility of terrorist theft of plutonium.\nWatson's first textbook, \"The Molecular Biology of the Gene\", used the concept of heads\u2014brief declarative subheadings. His next textbook was \"Molecular Biology of the Cell\", in which he coordinated the work of a group of scientist-writers. His third was \"Recombinant DNA\", which described the ways in which genetic engineering had brought new information about how organisms function.\nPublishing \"The Double Helix\".\nIn 1968, Watson wrote \"The Double Helix\", listed by the board of the Modern Library as number seven in their list of \"100 Best Nonfiction\" books. The book details the story of the discovery of the structure of DNA, as well as the personalities, conflicts and controversy surrounding their work, and includes many of his private emotional impressions at the time. Watson's original title was to have been \"Honest Jim\". Controversy surrounded the publication of the book. Watson's book was originally to be published by the Harvard University Press, but Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, among others, objected. Watson's home university dropped the project and the book was commercially published. In an interview with Anne Sayre for her book, \"Rosalind Franklin and DNA\" (published in 1975 and reissued in 2000), Francis Crick said that he regarded Watson's book as a \"contemptible pack of damned nonsense\".\nCold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\nIn 1968, Watson was appointed director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He and his wife, Elizabeth, had two sons between 1970 and 1972, and by 1974 the family had established a permanent residence in Cold Spring Harbor. Watson led the laboratory as director and president for approximately 35 years, subsequently serving as its chancellor and, later, chancellor emeritus.\nIn his roles as director, president, and chancellor, Watson led CSHL to articulate its present-day mission, \"dedication to exploring molecular biology and genetics in order to advance the understanding and ability to diagnose and treat cancers, neurological diseases, and other causes of human suffering.\" Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory substantially expanded both its research and its science educational programs under Watson's direction. He is credited with \"transforming a small facility into one of the world's great education and research institutions. Initiating a program to study the cause of human cancer, scientists under his direction have made major contributions to understanding the genetic basis of cancer.\" In a retrospective summary of Watson's accomplishments there, Bruce Stillman, the laboratory's president, said, \"Jim Watson created a research environment that is unparalleled in the world of science.\"\nIn 2007, Watson said, \"I turned against the left wing because they don't like genetics, because genetics implies that sometimes in life we fail because we have bad genes. They want all failure in life to be due to the evil system.\"\nHuman Genome Project.\nIn 1990, Watson was appointed as the head of the Human Genome Project at the National Institutes of Health, a position he held until April 10, 1992. Watson left the Genome Project after conflicts with the new NIH Director, Bernadine Healy. He was opposed to Healy's attempts to acquire patents on gene sequences, and any ownership of the \"laws of nature\". Two years before stepping down from the Genome Project, Watson had stated his own opinion on this long and ongoing controversy which he saw as an illogical barrier to research; Watson said, \"The nations of the world must see that the human genome belongs to the world's people, as opposed to its nations.\" He left within weeks of the 1992 announcement that the NIH would be applying for patents on brain-specific cDNAs. (The issue of the patentability of genes has since been resolved in the US by the US Supreme Court; see \"Association for Molecular Pathology v. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\".)\nIn 1994, Watson became president of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Francis Collins took over the role as director of the Human Genome Project. In 1997, Watson was quoted in \"The Sunday Telegraph\", stating: \"If you could find the gene which determines sexuality and a woman decides she doesn't want a homosexual child, well, let her.\" The biologist Richard Dawkins wrote a letter to \"The Independent\" claiming that Watson's position was misrepresented by \"The Sunday Telegraph\" article, and that Watson would equally consider the possibility of having a heterosexual child to be just as valid as any other reason for abortion, to emphasize that Watson is in favor of allowing choice.\nOn the issue of obesity, Watson was quoted in 2000, saying: \"Whenever you interview fat people, you feel bad, because you know you're not going to hire them.\" Watson repeatedly supported genetic screening and genetic engineering in public lectures and interviews, arguing that stupidity is a disease and the \"really stupid\" bottom 10% of people should be cured. He also suggested that beauty could be genetically engineered, saying in 2003, \"People say it would be terrible if we made all girls pretty. I think it would be great.\"\nIn 2007, Watson became the second person (after Craig Venter) to publish his fully sequenced genome online, after it was presented to him on May 31, 2007, by 454 Life Sciences Corporation in collaboration with scientists at the Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine. Watson was quoted as saying, \"I am putting my genome sequence on line to encourage the development of an era of personalized medicine, in which information contained in our genomes can be used to identify and prevent disease and to create individualized medical therapies\".\nLater life.\nIn 2014, Watson published a paper in \"The Lancet\" suggesting that biological oxidants may have a different role than is thought in diseases including diabetes, dementia, heart disease and cancer. For example, type 2 diabetes is usually thought to be caused by oxidation in the body that causes inflammation and kills off pancreatic cells. Watson thought the root of that inflammation was different: \"a lack of biological oxidants, not an excess\", and discussed this in detail. One critical response was that the idea was neither new nor worthy of merit, and that \"The Lancet\" published Watson's paper only because of his name. Other scientists expressed their support for his hypothesis and proposed that it could also be expanded to why a lack of oxidants can result in cancer and its progression.\nIn 2014, Watson sold his Nobel Prize medal to raise money after complaining of being made an \"unperson\" following controversial statements he had made. Part of the funds raised by the sale went to support scientific research. The medal sold at auction at Christie's in December 2014 for US$. Watson intended to contribute the proceeds to conservation work on Long Island and to funding research at Trinity College, Dublin. He was the first living Nobel recipient to auction a medal. The medal was later returned to Watson by the purchaser, Alisher Usmanov.\nNotable former students.\nSeveral of Watson's former doctoral students subsequently became notable in their own right including, Mario Capecchi, Bob Horvitz, Peter B. Moore and Joan Steitz. Besides numerous PhD students, Watson also supervised postdoctoral researchers and other interns including Ewan Birney, Ronald W. Davis, Phillip Allen Sharp (postdoc), John Tooze (postdoc), and Richard J. Roberts (postdoc).\nOther affiliations.\nWatson was a member of the Board of Directors of United Biomedical, Inc., founded by Chang Yi Wang. He held the position for six years and retired from the board in 1999. In January 2007, Watson accepted the invitation of Leonor Beleza, president of the Champalimaud Foundation, to become the head of the foundation's scientific council, an advisory organ.\nIn March 2017, Watson was named head consultant of the Cheerland Investment Group, a Chinese investment company which sponsored his trip. He was an institute adviser for the Allen Institute for Brain Science.\n\"Avoid Boring People\".\nWatson had disagreements with Craig Venter regarding his use of EST fragments while Venter worked at National Institutes of Health. Venter went on to found Celera genomics and continued his feud with Watson. Watson was quoted as calling Venter \"Hitler\".\nIn his 2007 memoir, \"Avoid Boring People: Lessons from a Life in Science\", Watson describes his academic colleagues as \"dinosaurs\", \"deadbeats\", \"fossils\", \"has-beens\", \"mediocre\", and \"vapid\". Steve Shapin in \"Harvard Magazine\" noted that Watson had written an unlikely \"Book of Manners\", telling about the skills needed at different times in a scientist's career; he wrote Watson was known for aggressively pursuing his own goals at the university. E. O. Wilson once described Watson as \"the most unpleasant human being I had ever met\", but in a later TV interview said that he considered them friends and their rivalry at Harvard \"old history\" (when they had competed for funding in their respective fields).\nIn the epilogue to the memoir \"Avoid Boring People\", Watson alternately attacks and defends former Harvard University president Lawrence Summers, who stepped down in 2006 due in part to his remarks about women and science. Watson also states in the epilogue, \"Anyone sincerely interested in understanding the imbalance in the representation of men and women in science must reasonably be prepared at least to consider the extent to which nature may figure, even with the clear evidence that nurture is strongly implicated.\"\nPublic remarks on genetics, intelligence, and race.\nGenetic determinism controversies.\nAt a conference in 2000, Watson suggested a link between skin color and sex drive, hypothesizing that dark-skinned people have stronger libidos. His lecture argued that extracts of melanin\u2014which gives skin its color\u2014had been found to boost subjects' sex drive. \"That's why you have Latin lovers\", he said, according to people who attended the lecture. \"You've never heard of an English lover. Only an \"English Patient\".\" Watson also said that stereotypes associated with racial and ethnic groups have a genetic basis: Jews being intelligent, Chinese being intelligent but not creative because of selection for conformity, and Indians being servile because of selection under caste endogamy. Regarding intelligence differences between blacks and whites, Watson has asserted that \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their (blacks) intelligence is the same as ours (whites) \u2013 whereas all the testing says not really\u00a0... people who have to deal with black employees find this not true.\"\nWatson repeatedly asserted that differences in average measured IQ between blacks and whites are due to genetics. In early October 2007, he was interviewed by Charlotte Hunt-Grubbe at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). Watson discussed his view that Africans are less intelligent than Westerners. Watson said his intention was to promote science, not racism, but some UK venues canceled his appearances, and Watson canceled the rest of his tour. An editorial in \"Nature\" said that his remarks were \"beyond the pale\" but expressed a wish that the tour had not been canceled so that Watson would have had to face his critics in person, encouraging scientific discussion on the matter. Because of the controversy, the board of trustees at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory suspended Watson's administrative responsibilities. Watson issued an apology, then retired at age 79 from CSHL from what the lab called \"nearly 40 years of distinguished service\". Watson attributed his retirement to his age and to circumstances that he could never have anticipated or desired.\nIn 2008, Watson was appointed chancellor emeritus of CSHL, but continued to advise and guide project work at the laboratory. In a BBC documentary that year, Watson said that he did not see himself as a racist. In January 2019, following the broadcast of a television documentary made the previous year in which he repeated his views about race and genetics, CSHL revoked honorary titles that it had awarded to Watson and cut all remaining ties with him. Watson did not respond to the developments.\nCriticism and legacy.\nCritics and elements of the general public have considered his scientific positions to be racist, sexist and unacceptable. Writing for \"Time\", Jeffery Kluger contrasts Watson's scientific legacy, giving rise to modern research and technology, with the legacy of his racist and sexist comments, and questions if the former can be lauded without endorsing the latter. Writing about Watson's relationship to eugenics, legal historian Paul Lombardo said that his legacy is complex, having opposed state-sponsored programs of forced sterilization, only to be undermined by his own repeated allegations that racism was genetically justified.\nPersonal life and death.\nWatson was an atheist. In 2003, he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto. He wrote in \"Time\" that he contributed $1,000 to Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign.\nWatson and Elizabeth Lewis married in 1968. They had two sons, Rufus Robert Watson (b. 1970) and Duncan James Watson (b. 1972). Watson sometimes talked about his son Rufus, who has schizophrenia, seeking to encourage progress in the understanding and treatment of mental illness by determining how genetics contributes to it.\nWatson died in East Northport, New York, on November 6, 2025, a week after being transferred to hospice care following treatment for an infection. He was 97. After his death, \"The New York Times\" called Watson one of the most important scientists of the 20th century while also acknowledging the controversy behind his racial views. The BBC noted that Watson's works \"opened the door\" to help explain how DNA replicates and carries genetic information while also \"setting the stage for rapid advances in molecular biology\".\nAwards and honors.\nWatson won numerous awards including:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHonorary degrees received.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16290", "revid": "51059801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16290", "title": "Jerk (physics)", "text": "Rate of change of acceleration with time\nJerk (also known as jolt) is the rate of change of an object's acceleration over time. It is a vector quantity (having both magnitude and direction). Jerk is most commonly denoted by the symbol j and expressed in m/s3 (SI units) or standard gravities per second(\"g\"0/s).\nExpressions.\nAs a vector, jerk j can be expressed as the first time derivative of acceleration, second time derivative of velocity, and third time derivative of position:\nformula_1\nWhere:\nThird-order differential equations of the form\nformula_2\nare sometimes called \"jerk equations\". When converted to an equivalent system of three ordinary first-order non-linear differential equations, jerk equations are the minimal setting for solutions showing chaotic behaviour. This condition generates mathematical interest in \"jerk systems\". Systems involving fourth-order derivatives or higher are accordingly called \"hyperjerk systems\".\nPhysiological effects and human perception.\nHuman body position is controlled by balancing the forces of antagonistic muscles. In balancing a given force, such as holding up a weight, the postcentral gyrus establishes a control loop to achieve the desired equilibrium. If the force changes too quickly, the muscles cannot relax or tense fast enough and overshoot in either direction, causing a temporary loss of control. The reaction time for responding to changes in force depends on physiological limitations and the attention level of the brain: an \"expected\" change will be stabilized faster than a \"sudden\" decrease or increase of load.\nTo avoid vehicle passengers losing control over body motion and getting injured, it is necessary to limit the exposure to both the maximum force (acceleration) \"and\" maximum jerk, since time is needed to adjust muscle tension and adapt to even limited stress changes. Sudden changes in acceleration can cause injuries such as whiplash. Excessive jerk may also result in an uncomfortable ride, even at levels that do not cause injury. Engineers expend considerable design effort minimizing \"jerky motion\" on elevators, trams, and other conveyances.\nFor example, consider the effects of acceleration and jerk when riding in a car:\nForce, acceleration, and jerk.\nFor a constant mass m, acceleration a is directly proportional to force F according to Newton's second law of motion:\nformula_3\nIn classical mechanics of rigid bodies, there are no \"forces\" associated with the derivatives of acceleration; however, physical systems experience oscillations and deformations as a result of jerk. In designing the Hubble Space Telescope, NASA set limits on both jerk and jounce.\nThe Abraham\u2013Lorentz force is the recoil force on an accelerating charged particle emitting radiation. This force is proportional to the particle's jerk and to the square of its charge. The Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory is a more advanced theory, applicable in a relativistic and quantum environment, and accounting for self-energy.\nIn an idealized setting.\nDiscontinuities in acceleration do not occur in real-world environments because of deformation, quantum mechanics effects, and other causes. However, a jump-discontinuity in acceleration and, accordingly, unbounded jerk are feasible in an idealized setting, such as an idealized point mass moving along a piecewise smooth, whole continuous path. The jump-discontinuity occurs at points where the path is not smooth. Extrapolating from these idealized settings, one can qualitatively describe, explain and predict the effects of jerk in real situations.\nJump-discontinuity in acceleration can be modeled using a Dirac delta function in jerk, scaled to the height of the jump. Integrating jerk over time across the Dirac delta yields the jump-discontinuity.\nFor example, consider a path along an arc of radius r, which tangentially connects to a straight line. The whole path is continuous, and its pieces are smooth. Now assume a point particle moves with constant speed along this path, so its tangential acceleration is zero. The centripetal acceleration given by is normal to the arc and inward. When the particle passes the connection of pieces, it experiences a jump-discontinuity in acceleration given by , and it undergoes a jerk that can be modeled by a Dirac delta, scaled to the jump-discontinuity.\nFor a more tangible example of discontinuous acceleration, consider an ideal spring\u2013mass system with the mass oscillating on an idealized surface with friction. The force on the mass is equal to the vector sum of the spring force and the kinetic frictional force. When the velocity changes sign (at the maximum and minimum displacements), the magnitude of the force on the mass changes by twice the magnitude of the frictional force, because the spring force is continuous and the frictional force reverses direction with velocity. The jump in acceleration equals the force on the mass divided by the mass. That is, each time the mass passes through a minimum or maximum displacement, the mass experiences a discontinuous acceleration, and the jerk contains a Dirac delta until the mass stops. The static friction force adapts to the residual spring force, establishing equilibrium with zero net force and zero velocity.\nConsider the example of a braking and decelerating car. The brake pads generate kinetic frictional forces and constant braking torques on the disks (or drums) of the wheels. Rotational velocity decreases linearly to zero with constant angular deceleration. The frictional force, torque, and car deceleration suddenly reach zero, which indicates a Dirac delta in physical jerk. The Dirac delta is smoothed down by the real environment, the cumulative effects of which are analogous to damping of the physiologically perceived jerk. This example neglects the effects of tire sliding, suspension dipping, real deflection of all ideally rigid mechanisms, etc.\nAnother example of significant jerk, analogous to the first example, is the cutting of a rope with a particle on its end. Assume the particle is oscillating in a circular path with non-zero centripetal acceleration. When the rope is cut, the particle's path changes abruptly to a straight path, and the force in the inward direction changes suddenly to zero. Imagine a monomolecular fiber cut by a laser; the particle would experience very high rates of jerk because of the extremely short cutting time.\nIn rotation.\nConsider a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis in an inertial reference frame. If its angular position as a function of time is \"\u03b8\"(\"t\"), the angular velocity, acceleration, and jerk can be expressed as follows:\nAngular acceleration equals the torque acting on the body, divided by the body's moment of inertia with respect to the momentary axis of rotation. A change in torque results in angular jerk.\nThe general case of a rotating rigid body can be modeled using kinematic screw theory, which includes one axial vector, angular velocity \u03a9(\"t\"), and one polar vector, linear velocity v(\"t\"). From this, the angular acceleration is defined as\nformula_7\nand the angular jerk is given by\nformula_8\ntaking the angular acceleration from as\nformula_9, we obtain\nformula_10\nreplacing formula_11 we can have the last item as\nformula_12, and we finally get\nformula_13\nor vice versa, replacing formula_14 with formula_15:\nformula_16\nFor example, consider a Geneva drive, a device used for creating intermittent rotation of a driven wheel (the blue wheel in the animation) by continuous rotation of a driving wheel (the red wheel in the animation). During one cycle of the driving wheel, the driven wheel's angular position \u03b8 changes by 90 degrees and then remains constant. Because of the finite thickness of the driving wheel's fork (the slot for the driving pin), this device generates a discontinuity in the angular acceleration \u03b1, and an unbounded angular jerk \u03b6 in the driven wheel.\nJerk does not preclude the Geneva drive from being used in applications such as movie projectors and cams. In movie projectors, the film advances frame-by-frame, but the projector operation has low noise and is highly reliable because of the low film load (only a small section of film weighing a few grams is driven), the moderate speed (2.4\u00a0m/s), and the low friction.\nWith cam drive systems, use of a dual cam can avoid the jerk of a single cam; however, the dual cam is bulkier and more expensive. The dual-cam system has two cams on one axle that shifts a second axle by a fraction of a revolution. The graphic shows step drives of one-sixth and one-third rotation per one revolution of the driving axle. There is no radial clearance because two arms of the stepped wheel are always in contact with the double cam. Generally, combined contacts may be used to avoid the jerk (and wear and noise) associated with a single follower (such as a single follower gliding along a slot and changing its contact point from one side of the slot to the other can be avoided by using two followers sliding along the same slot, one side each).\nIn elastically deformable matter.\nAn elastically deformable mass deforms under an applied force (or acceleration); the deformation is a function of its stiffness and the magnitude of the force. If the change in force is slow, the jerk is small, and the propagation of deformation is considered instantaneous as compared to the change in acceleration. The distorted body acts as if it were in a quasistatic regime, and only a changing force (nonzero jerk) can cause propagation of mechanical waves (or electromagnetic waves for a charged particle); therefore, for nonzero to high jerk, a shock wave and its propagation through the body should be considered.\nThe propagation of deformation is shown in the graphic \"Compression wave patterns\" as a compressional plane wave through an elastically deformable material. Also shown, for angular jerk, are the deformation waves propagating in a circular pattern, which causes shear stress and possibly other modes of vibration. The reflection of waves along the boundaries cause constructive interference patterns (not pictured), producing stresses that may exceed the material's limits. The deformation waves may cause vibrations, which can lead to noise, wear, and failure, especially in cases of resonance.\nThe graphic captioned \"Pole with massive top\" shows a block connected to an elastic pole and a massive top. The pole bends when the block accelerates, and when the acceleration stops, the top will oscillate (damped) under the regime of pole stiffness. One could argue that a greater (periodic) jerk might excite a larger amplitude of oscillation because small oscillations are damped before reinforcement by a shock wave. One can also argue that a larger jerk might increase the probability of exciting a resonant mode because the larger wave components of the shock wave have higher frequencies and Fourier coefficients.\nTo reduce the amplitude of excited stress waves and vibrations, one can limit jerk by shaping motion and making the acceleration continuous with slopes as flat as possible. Due to limitations of abstract models, algorithms for reducing vibrations include higher derivatives, such as jounce, or suggest continuous regimes for both acceleration and jerk. One concept for limiting jerk is to shape acceleration and deceleration sinusoidally with zero acceleration in between (see graphic captioned \"Sinusoidal acceleration profile\"), making the speed appear sinusoidal with constant maximum speed. The jerk, however, will remain discontinuous at the points where acceleration enters and leaves the zero phases.\nIn the geometric design of roads and tracks.\nRoads and tracks are designed to limit the jerk caused by changes in their curvature. Design standards for high-speed rail vary from 0.2\u00a0m/s3 to 0.6\u00a0m/s3. Track transition curves limit the jerk when transitioning from a straight line to a curve, or vice versa. Recall that in constant-speed motion along an arc, acceleration is zero in the tangential direction and nonzero in the inward normal direction. Transition curves gradually increase the curvature and, consequently, the centripetal acceleration.\nA Euler spiral, the theoretically optimum transition curve, linearly increases centripetal acceleration and results in constant jerk &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. In real-world applications, the plane of the track is inclined (cant) along the curved sections. The incline causes vertical acceleration, which is a design consideration for wear on the track and embankment. The Wiener Kurve (Viennese Curve) is a patented curve designed to minimize this wear.\nRollercoasters are also designed with track transitions to limit jerk. When entering a loop, acceleration values can reach around 4\"g\" (40\u00a0m/s2), and riding in this high acceleration environment is only possible with track transitions. S-shaped curves, such as figure eights, also use track transitions for smooth rides.\nIn motion control.\nIn motion control, the design focus is on straight, linear motion, with the need to move a system from one steady position to another (point-to-point motion). The design concern from a jerk perspective is vertical jerk; the jerk from tangential acceleration is effectively zero since linear motion is non-rotational.\nMotion control applications include passenger elevators and machining tools. Limiting vertical jerk is considered essential for elevator riding convenience. ISO 8100-34 specifies measurement methods for elevator ride quality with respect to jerk, acceleration, vibration, and noise; however, the standard does not specify levels for acceptable or unacceptable ride quality. It is reported that most passengers rate a vertical jerk of 2\u00a0m/s3 as acceptable and 6\u00a0m/s3 as intolerable. For hospitals, 0.7\u00a0m/s3 is the recommended limit.\nA primary design goal for motion control is to minimize the transition time without exceeding speed, acceleration, or jerk limits. Consider a third-order motion-control profile with quadratic ramping and deramping phases in velocity.\nThis motion profile consists of the following seven segments:\nSegment four's time period (constant velocity) varies with distance between the two positions. If this distance is so small that omitting segment four would not suffice, then segments two and six (constant acceleration) could be equally reduced, and the constant velocity limit would not be reached. If this modification does not sufficiently reduce the crossed distance, then segments one, three, five, and seven could be shortened by an equal amount, and the constant acceleration limits would not be reached.\nOther motion profile strategies are used, such as minimizing the square of jerk for a given transition time and, as discussed above, sinusoidal-shaped acceleration profiles. Motion profiles are tailored for specific applications including machines, people movers, chain hoists, automobiles, and robotics.\nIn manufacturing.\nJerk is an important consideration in manufacturing processes. Rapid changes in acceleration of a cutting tool can lead to premature tool wear and result in uneven cuts; consequently, modern motion controllers include jerk limitation features. In mechanical engineering, jerk, in addition to velocity and acceleration, is considered in the development of cam profiles because of tribological implications and the ability of the actuated body to follow the cam profile without chatter.\nJerk is often considered when vibration is a concern. A device that measures jerk is called a \"jerkmeter\".\nFurther derivatives.\nFurther time derivatives have also been named, as snap or jounce (fourth derivative), crackle (fifth derivative), and pop (sixth derivative). Time derivatives of position of higher order than four appear rarely.\nThe terms \"snap\", \"crackle\", and \"pop\"\u200d\u2014\u200cfor the fourth, fifth, and sixth derivatives of position\u200d\u2014\u200cwere inspired by the advertising mascots Snap, Crackle and Pop.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
