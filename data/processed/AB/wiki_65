It is the national language of both North Korea and South Korea. In the south, the language is known as ' () and in the north, it is known as ' (). Since the turn of the 21st century, Korean popular culture have spread around the world through globalization and cultural exports.\nBeyond Korea, the language is recognized as a minority language in parts of China, namely Jilin, and specifically Yanbian Prefecture, and Changbai County. It is also spoken by Sakhalin Koreans in parts of Sakhalin, the Russian island just north of Japan, and by the in parts of Central Asia. The language has a few extinct relatives which\u2014along with the Jeju language (Jejuan) of Jeju Island and Korean itself\u2014form the compact Koreanic language family. Even so, Jejuan and Korean are not mutually intelligible. The linguistic homeland of Korean is suggested to be somewhere in contemporary Manchuria. The hierarchy of the society from which the language originates deeply influences the language, leading to a system of speech levels and honorifics indicative of the formality of any given situation.\nModern Korean is written in the Korean script (; in South Korea, ; in North Korea), an alphabet system developed during the 15th century for that purpose, although it did not become the primary script until the mid 20th century (Hanja and mixed script were the primary script until then). The script uses 24 basic letters (\"jamo\") and 27 complex letters formed from the basic ones.\nInterest in Korean language acquisition (as a foreign language) has been generated by longstanding alliances, military involvement, and diplomacy, such as between South Korea\u2013United States and China\u2013North Korea since the end of World War II and the Korean War. Along with other languages such as Chinese and Arabic, Korean is ranked at the top difficulty level for English speakers by the United States Department of Defense.\nHistory.\nModern Korean descends from Middle Korean, which in turn descends from Old Korean, which descends from the Proto-Koreanic language, which is generally suggested to have its linguistic homeland somewhere in Manchuria. Whitman (2012) suggests that the proto-Koreans, already present in northern Korea, expanded into the southern part of the Korean Peninsula at around 300 BC and coexisted with the descendants of the Japonic Mumun cultivators (or assimilated them). Both had influence on each other and a later founder effect diminished the internal variety of both language families.\nSince the establishment of two independent governments, North\u2013South differences have developed in standard Korean, including variations in pronunciation and vocabulary chosen. While there tends to be strong political conflict between North and South Korea regarding these linguistic \"differences,\" regional dialects within each country actually display greater linguistic variations than those found between North and South Korean standards. Nevertheless, these dialects remain largely mutually intelligible.\nWriting systems.\nThe Chinese language, written with Chinese characters and read with Sino-Xenic pronunciations, was first introduced to Korea in the 1st century BC, and remained the medium of formal writing and government until the late 19th century. Korean scholars adapted Chinese characters (known in Korean as Hanja) to write their own language, creating scripts known as idu, hyangchal, gugyeol, and gakpil. These systems were cumbersome, due to the fundamental disparities between the Korean and Chinese languages, and accessible only to those educated in classical Chinese. Most of the population was illiterate.\nIn the 15th century King Sejong the Great personally developed an alphabetic featural writing system, known today as Hangul, to promote literacy among the common people. Introduced in the document , it was called ('colloquial script') and quickly spread nationwide to increase literacy in Korea.\nThe Korean alphabet was denounced by the aristocracy, who looked down upon it for being too easy to learn. However, it gained widespread use among the common class and was widely used to print popular novels which were enjoyed by the common class. Since few people could understand official documents written in classical Chinese, Korean kings sometimes released public notices entirely written in Hangul as early as the 16th century for all Korean classes, including uneducated peasants and slaves. By the 17th century, the had exchanged Hangul letters with slaves, which suggests a high literacy rate of Hangul during the Joseon era.\nIn the context of growing Korean nationalism in the 19th century, the Kabo Reform of 1894 abolished the Confucian examinations and decreed that government documents would be issued in Hangul instead of literary Chinese. Some newspapers were published in Hangul, but other publications used Korean mixed script, with Hanja for Sino-Korean vocabulary and Hangul for other elements. North Korea abolished Hanja in writing in 1949, but continues to teach them in schools. Their usage in South Korea is mainly reserved for specific circumstances such as newspapers, scholarly papers and disambiguation. Today Hanja is largely unused in everyday life but is still important for historical and linguistic studies.\nNames.\nThe Korean names for the language are based on the names for Korea used in both South Korea and North Korea. The English word \"Korean\" is derived from Goryeo, which is thought to be the first Korean dynasty known to Western nations. Korean people in the former USSR refer to themselves as or (literally, 'Koryo/Goryeo people'), and call the language . Some older English sources also use the spelling \"Corea\" to refer to the nation, and its inflected form for the language, culture and people, \"Korea\" becoming more popular in the late 1800s.\nIn South Korea the Korean language is referred to by many names including ('Korean language'), ('Korean speech') and ('our language'); \" is taken from the name of the Korean Empire (; ; ). The \" () in and is derived from Samhan, in reference to the Three Kingdoms of Korea (not the ancient confederacies in the southern Korean Peninsula), while \" and \" mean \"language\" and \"speech\", respectively. Korean is also simply referred to as , literally \"national language\". This name is based on the same Han characters ( 'nation' + 'language') that are also used in Taiwan and Japan to refer to their respective national languages.\nIn North Korea and China, the language is most often called , or more formally, . This is taken from the North Korean name for Korea (Joseon), a name retained from the Joseon period until the proclamation of the Korean Empire, which in turn was annexed by the Empire of Japan.\nIn mainland China, following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term or the short form \"Ch\u00e1oy\u01d4\" has normally been used to refer to the standard language of North Korea and Yanbian, whereas \"H\u00e1ngu\u00f3y\u01d4\" or the short form \"H\u00e1ny\u01d4\" is used to refer to the standard language of South Korea.\nClassification.\nKorean is a member of the Koreanic family along with the Jeju language. Some linguists have included it in the Altaic family, but the core Altaic proposal itself has lost most of its prior support. The Khitan language has several vocabulary items similar to Korean that are not found in other Mongolian or Tungusic languages, suggesting a Korean influence on Khitan.\nThe hypothesis that Korean could be related to Japanese has had some supporters due to some overlap in vocabulary and similar grammatical features that have been elaborated upon by such researchers as Samuel E. Martin and Roy Andrew Miller. Sergei Starostin (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese\u2013Korean 100-word Swadesh list.\nSome linguists concerned with the issue between Japanese and Korean, including Alexander Vovin, have argued that the indicated similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a \"sprachbund\" effect and heavy borrowing, especially from Ancient Korean into Western Old Japanese. A good example might be Middle Korean \"s\u00e0m\" and Japanese \"as\u00e1\", meaning 'hemp'. This word seems to be a cognate, but although it is well attested in Western Old Japanese and Northern Ryukyuan languages, in Eastern Old Japanese it only occurs in compounds, and it is only present in three dialects of the Southern Ryukyuan language group. Also, the doublet \"wo\" meaning 'hemp' is attested in Western Old Japanese and Southern Ryukyuan languages. It is thus plausible to assume a borrowed term.\nHudson &amp; Robbeets (2020) suggested that there are traces of a pre-Nivkh substratum in Korean. According to the hypothesis, ancestral varieties of Nivkh (also known as \"Amuric\") were once distributed on the Korean Peninsula before the arrival of Koreanic speakers.\nPhonology.\nKorean syllable structure is (C)(G)V(C), consisting of an optional onset consonant, glide and final coda surrounding a core vowel.\nConsonants.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAssimilation and allophony.\nThe IPA symbol \u27e8\u27e9 () is used to denote the tensed consonants . Its official use in the extensions to the IPA is for \"strong\" articulation, but is used in the literature for faucalized voice. The Korean consonants also have elements of stiff voice, but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted glottis and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.\n is aspirated and becomes an alveolo-palatal before or for most speakers (but see North\u2013South differences in the Korean language). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, changes to (example: beoseot () 'mushroom').\n may become a bilabial before or , a palatal before or , a velar before , a voiced between voiced sounds, and a elsewhere.\n become voiced between voiced sounds.\n frequently denasalize at the beginnings of words.\n becomes alveolar flap between vowels, and or at the end of a syllable or next to another . A written syllable-final \", when followed by a vowel or a glide (\"i.e.\", when the next character starts with \"), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes .\nTraditionally, was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before , and otherwise became . However, the inflow of western loanwords changed the trend, and now word-initial (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either or .\nAll obstruents (plosives, affricates, fricatives) at the end of a word are pronounced with no audible release, .\nPlosive sounds become nasals before nasal sounds.\nHangul spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical morphology. Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.\nThe traditional prohibition of word-initial became a morphological rule called \"initial law\" () in the pronunciation standards of South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial in the pronunciation standards of North Korea. For example,\nVowels.\nThe standard Korean monophthongs and their pronunciation principles are as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^[A] is closer to a near-open central vowel (), though \u27e8a\u27e9 is still used for tradition.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^[B] \u3153 is generally pronounced as [\u0259] when it becomes a long vowel.\nHowever, in Korea, with the exception of older generations in certain regions, most people neither pronounce nor distinguish clearly between the two monophthongs '\u3150' (ae) and '\u3154' (e). Similarly, '\u315f' and '\u315a' are sometimes pronounced as [wi] and [we] respectively. The demographic that maintains monophthongal realizations of '\u315f' and '\u315a' is reportedly limited to elderly speakers in the Gyeonggi, Gangwon, and Chungcheong provinces. The official standard pronunciation guidelines acknowledge this variation by permitting both monophthongal and diphthongal pronunciations of these vowels.\nIn South Korea, while the distinction between long and short vowels is not clearly pronounced in contemporary speech, this distinction is maintained in standard language norms for reasons of tradition and semantic differentiation.\nMorphophonemics.\nGrammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include \"-eun/-neun\" () and \"-i/-ga\" ().\nSometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include \"-eul/-reul\" (), \"-euro/-ro\" (), \"-eseo/-seo\" (), \"-ideunji/-deunji\" () and \"-iya/-ya\" ().\nSome verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.\nGrammar.\nKorean is an agglutinative language. The Korean language is traditionally considered to have nine parts of speech. Modifiers generally precede the modified words, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The sentence structure or basic form of a Korean sentence is subject\u2013object\u2013verb (SOV), but the \"verb\" is the only required and immovable element and word order is highly flexible, as in many other agglutinative languages.\nQuestion\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nResponse\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe relationship between a speaker/writer and their subject and audience is paramount in Korean grammar. The relationship between the speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in \"honorifics\", whereas that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in \"speech level\".\nHonorifics.\nWhen talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if they are an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if they are a younger stranger, student, employee, or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences, and both honorific or normal sentences.\nHonorifics in traditional Korea were strictly hierarchical. The caste and estate systems possessed patterns and usages much more complex and stratified than those used today. The intricate structure of the Korean honorific system flourished in traditional culture and society. Honorifics in contemporary Korea are now used for people who are psychologically distant. Honorifics are also used for people who are superior in status, such as older people, teachers, and employers.\nSpeech levels.\nThere are seven verb paradigms or \"speech levels\" in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. Unlike honorifics\u2014which are used to show respect towards the referent (the person spoken of)\u2014\"speech levels\" are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience (the person spoken to). The names of the seven levels are derived from the non-honorific imperative form of the verb (\"hada\", \"do\") in each level, plus the suffix (\"che\", Hanja: ), which means \"style\".\nThe three levels with high politeness (very formally polite, formally polite, casually polite) are generally grouped together as \"jondaesmal\" (), whereas the two levels with low politeness (formally impolite, casually impolite) are \"banmal\" () in Korean. The remaining two levels (neutral formality with neutral politeness, high formality with neutral politeness) are neither polite nor impolite.\nNowadays, younger-generation speakers no longer feel obligated to lower their usual regard toward the referent. It is common to see younger people talk to their older relatives with \"banmal\". This is not out of disrespect, but instead it shows the intimacy and the closeness of the relationship between the two speakers. Transformations in social structures and attitudes in today's rapidly changing society have brought about change in the way people speak.\nGender.\nIn general, Korean lacks grammatical gender. As one of the few exceptions, the third-person singular pronoun has two different forms: \uadf8 \"geu\" (male) and \uadf8\ub140 \"geunyeo\" (female). Before \uadf8\ub140 was invented in need of translating 'she' into Korean, \uadf8 was the only third-person singular pronoun and had no grammatical gender. Its origin causes \uadf8\ub140 never to be used in spoken Korean but appearing only in writing.\nTo have a more complete understanding of the intricacies of gender in Korean, three models of language and gender that have been proposed: the deficit model, the dominance model, and the cultural difference model. In the deficit model, male speech is seen as the default, and any form of speech that diverges from that norm (female speech) is seen as lesser than. The dominance model sees women as lacking in power due to living within a patriarchal society. The cultural difference model proposes that the difference in upbringing between men and women can explain the differences in their speech patterns. It is important to look at the models to better understand the misogynistic conditions that shaped the ways that men and women use the language. Korean's lack of grammatical gender makes it different from most European languages. Rather, gendered differences in Korean can be observed through formality, intonation, word choice, etc.\nHowever, one can still find stronger contrasts between genders within Korean speech. Some examples of this can be seen in: (1) the softer tone used by women in speech; (2) a married woman introducing herself as someone's mother or wife, not with her own name; (3) the presence of gender differences in titles and occupational terms (for example, a \"sajang\" is a company president, and \"y\u014fsajang\" is a female company president); (4) females sometimes using more tag questions and rising tones in statements, also seen in speech from children.\nBetween two people of asymmetric status in Korean society, people tend to emphasize differences in status for the sake of solidarity. Koreans prefer to use kinship terms, rather than any other terms of reference. In traditional Korean society, women have long been in disadvantaged positions. Korean social structure traditionally was a patriarchically dominated family system that emphasized the maintenance of family lines. That structure has tended to separate the roles of women from those of men.\nCho and Whitman (2019) explore how categories such as male and female and social context influence Korean's features. For example, they point out that usage of \"jagi\" (\uc790\uae30 you) is dependent on context. Among middle-aged women, \"jagi\" is used to address someone who is close to them, while young Koreans use \"jagi\" to address their lovers or spouses regardless of gender.\nKorean society's prevalent attitude towards men being in public (outside the home) and women living in private still exists today. For instance, the word for \"husband\" is \"bakkannyangban\" (\ubc14\uae65\uc591\ubc18 'outside nobleman'), but a husband introduces his wife as \"ansaram\" (\uc548\uc0ac\ub78c an 'inside' 'person'). Also in kinship terminology, \"oe\" (\uc678 'outside' or 'wrong') is added for maternal grandparents, creating \"oeharabeoji\" and \"oehalmeoni\" (\uc678\ud560\uc544\ubc84\uc9c0, \uc678\ud560\uba38\ub2c8 'grandfather and grandmother'), with different lexicons for males and females and patriarchal society revealed. Further, in interrogatives to an addressee of equal or lower status, Korean men tend to use \"haennya\" (\ud588\ub0d0? 'did it?')' in aggressive masculinity, but women use \"haenni\" (\ud588\ub2c8? 'did it?')' as a soft expression. However, there are exceptions. Korean society used the question endings \"-ni\" () and \"-nya\" (), the former prevailing among women and men until a few decades ago. In fact, \"-nya\" () was characteristic of the Jeolla and Chungcheong dialects. However, since the 1950s, large numbers of people have moved to Seoul from Chungcheong and Jeolla, and they began to influence the way men speak. Recently, women also have used the \"-nya\" (). As for \"-ni\" (), it is usually used toward people to be polite even to someone not close or younger. As for \"-nya\" (), it is used mainly to close friends regardless of gender.\nLike the case of \"actor\" and \"actress\", it also is possible to add a gender prefix for emphasis: \"biseo\" (\ube44\uc11c 'secretary') is sometimes combined with \"yeo\" (\uc5ec 'female') to form \"yeobiseo\" (\uc5ec\ube44\uc11c 'female secretary'); \"namja\" (\ub0a8\uc790 'man') often is added to \"ganhosa\" (\uac04\ud638\uc0ac 'nurse') to form \"namja ganhosa\" (\ub0a8\uc790 \uac04\ud638\uc0ac 'male nurse').\nAnother crucial difference between men and women is the tone and pitch of their voices and how they affect the perception of politeness. Men learn to use an authoritative falling tone; in Korean culture, a deeper voice is associated with being more polite. In addition to the deferential speech endings being used, men are seen as more polite as well as impartial, and professional. While women who use a rising tone in conjunction with \"-yo\" () are not perceived to be as polite as men. The \"-yo\" () also indicates uncertainty since the ending has many prefixes that indicate uncertainty and questioning while the deferential ending has no prefixes to indicate uncertainty. The \"-hamnida\" () ending is the most polite and formal form of Korea, and the \"-yo\" () ending is less polite and formal, which reinforces the perception of women as less professional.\nHedges and euphemisms to soften assertions are common in women's speech. Women traditionally add nasal sounds \"neyng\", \"neym\", \"ney-e\" in the last syllable more frequently than men. Often, \"l\" is added in women's for female stereotypes and so \"igeolo\" (\uc774\uac70\ub85c 'this thing') becomes \"igeollo\" (\uc774\uac78\ub85c 'this thing') to communicate a lack of confidence and passivity.\nWomen use more linguistic markers such as exclamation \"eomeo\" (\uc5b4\uba38 'oh') and \"eojjeom\" (\uc5b4\uca5c 'what a surprise') than men do in cooperative communication.\nVocabulary.\nThe core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of \"native Korean\" words. However, a significant proportion of the vocabulary, especially words that denote abstract ideas, are \"Sino-Korean\" words. To a much lesser extent, some words have also been borrowed from Mongolian and other languages. More recent loanwords are dominated by English.\nIn South Korea, it is widely believed that North Korea wanted to emphasize the use of unique Korean expressions in its language and eliminate the influence of foreign languages. However, according to researchers such as Jeon Soo-tae, who has seen first-hand data from North Korea, the country has reduced the number of difficult foreign words in a similar way to South Korea.\nIn 2021, Moon Sung-guk of Kim Il Sung University in North Korea wrote in his thesis that Kim Jong Il had said that vernacularized Sino-Korean vocabulary should be used as it is, not modified. \"A language is in constant interaction with other languages, and in the process it is constantly being developed and enriched,\" he said. According to the paper, Kim Jong Il argued that academic terms used in the natural sciences and engineering, such as (; 'computer') and (; 'hard disk') should remain in the names of their inventors, and that the word (; 'chocolate') should not be replaced because it had been used for so long.\nSouth Korea defines its vocabulary standards through the https:// (Standard Korean Language Dictionary), and North Korea defines its vocabulary standards through the https:// (Korean Language Dictionary).\nSino-Korean.\nSino-Korean vocabulary consists of:\nTherefore, just like other words, Korean has two sets of numeral systems. English is similar, having native English words and Latinate equivalents such as \"water-aqua\", \"fire-flame\", \"sea-marine\", \"two-dual\", \"sun-solar\", \"star-stellar\". However, unlike English and Latin which belong to the same Indo-European languages family and bear a certain resemblance, Korean and Chinese are genetically unrelated and the two sets of Korean words differ completely from each other. All Sino-Korean morphemes are monosyllabic as in Chinese, whereas native Korean morphemes can be polysyllabic. The Sino-Korean words were deliberately imported alongside corresponding Chinese characters for a written language and everything was supposed to be written in Hanja, so the coexistence of Sino-Korean would be more thorough and systematic than that of Latinate words in English.\nThe exact proportion of Sino-Korean vocabulary is a matter of debate. Sohn (2001) stated 50\u201360%. In 2006 the same author gives an even higher estimate of 65%. Jeong Jae-do, one of the compilers of the dictionary \"Urimal Keun Sajeon\", asserts that the proportion is not so high. He points out that Korean dictionaries compiled during the colonial period include many unused Sino-Korean words. In his estimation, the proportion of Sino-Korean vocabulary in the Korean language might be as low as 30%.\nWestern loanwords.\nThe vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, approximately 90% of which are from English. Many words have also been borrowed from Western languages such as German via Japanese (e.g. (\"areubaiteu\") 'part-time job', (\"allereugi\") 'allergy', (\"gibseu\" or \"gibuseu\") 'plaster cast used for broken bones'). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese during the Japanese occupation of Korea, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example \"dozen\"\u00a0&gt; \"d\u0101su\"\u00a0&gt; \"daseu\". However, most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current \"Hangulization\" rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented \"Hangeulizations\" of the countries' endonyms or English names.\nBecause of such a prevalence of English in modern South Korean culture and society, lexical borrowing is inevitable. English-derived Korean, or \"Konglish\" (), is increasingly used. The vocabulary of the South Korean dialect of the Korean language is roughly 5% loanwords (excluding Sino-Korean vocabulary). However, due to North Korea's isolation, such influence is lacking in North Korean speech.\nWriting system.\nModern Korean is written with an alphabet script, known as in South Korea and in North Korea. The Korean mixed script, combining Hanja and Hangul, is still used to a certain extent in South Korea, but that method is slowly declining in use even though students learn Hanja in school.\nBelow are charts of the letters of the Korean alphabet and their Revised Romanization (RR) and canonical International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) values:\nThe letters of the Korean alphabet are not written linearly like most alphabets, but instead arranged into blocks that represent syllables. So, while the word \"bibimbap\" (Korean rice dish) is written as eight characters in a row in the Latin alphabet, in Korean it is written , as three \"syllabic blocks\" in a row. \"Mukbang\" ( 'eating show') is seven characters after romanization but only two \"syllabic blocks\" before.\nModern Korean is written with spaces between words, a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese (except when Japanese is written exclusively in hiragana, as in children's books). The marks used for Korean punctuation are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns, from top to bottom, right to left, like traditional Chinese. However, the syllabic blocks are now usually written in rows, from left to right, top to bottom, like English.\nDialects.\nKorean has numerous small local dialects (called \"mal\" (; lit.\u00a0'speech'), \"saturi\" (), or \"bangeon\" (; )). South Korean authors claim that the standard language (\"pyojuneo\" or \"pyojunmal\") of both South Korea and North Korea is based on the dialect of the area around Seoul (which, as Hanyang, was the capital of Joseon-era Korea for 500 years), but since 1966, North Korea officially states that its standard is based on the Pyongyang speech. All dialects of Korean are similar to one another and largely are mutually intelligible (with the exception of dialect-specific phrases or nonstandard vocabulary unique to dialects) though the dialect of Jeju Island is divergent enough to be generally considered a separate language. The Yukjin dialect in the far northeast is also quite distinctive.\nOne of the more salient differences between dialects is the use of tone: speakers of the Seoul dialect make use of vowel length, but speakers of the Gyeongsang dialect maintain the pitch accent of Middle Korean. Some dialects are conservative, maintaining Middle Korean sounds (such as \"z, \u03b2, \u0259\"), which have been lost from the standard language, and others are highly innovative.\n, , and suggest that the modern Seoul dialect is currently undergoing tonogenesis based on the finding that in recent years lenis consonants (\u3142\u3148\u3137\u3131), aspirated consonants (\u314d\u314a\u314c\u314b) and fortis consonants (\u3143\u3149\u3138\u3132) were shifting from a distinction via voice onset time to that of pitch change; however, disagree with the suggestion that the consonant distinction shifting away from voice onset time is due to the introduction of tonal features, and instead proposes that it is a prosodically conditioned change.\nThere is substantial evidence for a history of extensive dialect levelling or even convergent evolution or intermixture of two or more originally-distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have a basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects. For example, \"garlic chives\" translated into Gyeongsang dialect is (; ), but in Standard Korean, it is (; ). This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is today. See also the Japanese\u2013Koreanic languages hypothesis.\nNorth\u2013South differences.\nThe language used in the North and the South exhibit differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary.\nPronunciation.\nIn North Korea, palatalization of is optional, and can be pronounced between vowels.\nWords that are written the same way may be pronounced differently (such as the examples below). The pronunciations below are given in Revised Romanization, McCune\u2013Reischauer and modified Hangul (what the Korean characters would be if one were to write the word as pronounced).\nSpelling.\nSome words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.\nSpelling \"and\" pronunciation.\nBasically, the standard languages of North and South Korea, including pronunciation and vocabulary, are both linguistically based on the Seoul dialect, but in North Korea, words have been modified to reflect the theories of scholars like Kim Tu-bong, who sought a refined language, as well as political needs. Some differences are difficult to explain in terms of political ideas, such as North Korea's use of the word \"rajio\" ().:\nIn general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:\nGrammar.\nSome grammatical constructions are also different:\nPunctuation.\nIn the North, guillemets ( and ) are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones ( and ) are standard (although and are also used).\nVocabulary.\nSome vocabulary is different between the North and the South:\nGeographic distribution.\nKorean is spoken by the Korean people in both South Korea and North Korea, and by the Korean diaspora in many countries including the People's Republic of China, the United States, Japan, and Russia. In 2001, Korean was the fourth most popular foreign language in China, following English, Japanese, and Russian. Korean-speaking minorities exist in these states, but because of cultural assimilation into host countries, not all ethnic Koreans may speak it with native fluency.\nOfficial status.\nKorean is the official language of South Korea and North Korea. It, along with Mandarin Chinese, is also one of the two official languages of China's Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture.\nIn North Korea, the regulatory body is the Language Institute of the Academy of Social Sciences (; ; ). In South Korea, the regulatory body for Korean is the Seoul-based National Institute of Korean Language, which was created by presidential decree on 23 January 1991.\nKing Sejong Institute.\nEstablished pursuant to Article 9, Section 2, of the Framework Act on the National Language, the King Sejong Institute is a public institution set up to coordinate the government's project of propagating Korean language and culture; it also supports the King Sejong Institute, which is the institution's overseas branch. The King Sejong Institute was established in response to:\nKing Sejong Institute has 59 in Europe, 15 in Africa, 146 in Asia, 34 in the Americas, and 4 in Oceania.\nTOPIK Korea Institute.\nThe TOPIK Korea Institute is a lifelong educational center affiliated with a variety of Korean universities in Seoul, South Korea, whose aim is to promote Korean language and culture, support local Korean teaching internationally, and facilitate cultural exchanges.\nThe institute is sometimes compared to language and culture promotion organizations such as the King Sejong Institute. Unlike that organization, however, the TOPIK Korea Institute operates within established universities and colleges around the world, providing educational materials. In countries around the world, Korean embassies and cultural centers () administer TOPIK examinations.\nForeign language.\nFor native English-speakers, Korean is generally considered to be one of the most difficult foreign languages to master despite the relative ease of learning Hangul. For instance, the United States' Defense Language Institute places Korean in Category IV with Japanese, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), and Arabic, requiring 64 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 26 weeks for Category I languages like Italian, French, and Spanish) to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which they have \"sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements\" and \"can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense.\" Similarly, the Foreign Service Institute's School of Language Studies places Korean in Category IV, the highest level of difficulty.\nThe study of the Korean language in the United States was dominated by Korean American heritage language students; in 2007, these students were estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. However, Sejong Institutes in the United States have noted a sharp rise in the number of people of other ethnic backgrounds studying Korean between 2009 and 2011, which they attribute to rising popularity of South Korean music and television shows. In 2018, it was reported that the rise in K-Pop was responsible for the increase in people learning the language in US universities.\nTesting.\nThere are two widely used tests of Korean as a foreign language: the Korean Language Ability Test (KLAT) and the Test of Proficiency in Korean (TOPIK). The Korean Language Proficiency Test, an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers' competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination. The TOPIK was first administered in 1997 and was taken by 2,274 people. Since then the total number of people who have taken the TOPIK has surpassed 1 million, with more than 150,000 candidates taking the test in 2012. TOPIK is administered in 45 regions within South Korea and 72 nations outside of South Korea, with a significant portion being administered in Japan and North America, which would suggest the targeted audience for TOPIK is still primarily foreigners of Korean heritage. This is also evident in TOPIK's website, where the examination is introduced as intended for Korean heritage students.\nExample text.\nFrom Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Korean (South Korean standard):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is best known for his collaborations with David Lynch, having portrayed his role as Dale Cooper thrice in \"Twin Peaks\" (1990\u20131991, 2017), which won him a Golden Globe and nominations for two Primetime Emmy Awards, and its film prequel \"\" (1992), as well as playing Paul Atreides in \"Dune\" (1984) and Jeffrey Beaumont in \"Blue Velvet\" (1986). MacLachlan's other film roles include Lloyd Gallagher in \"The Hidden\" (1987), Ray Manzarek in \"The Doors\" (1991), Cliff Vandercave in \"The Flintstones\" (1994), Zack Carey in \"Showgirls\" (1995), and Riley's father in the two films of the \"Inside Out\" film series (2015, 2024).\nIn addition to \"Twin Peaks\", MacLachlan has had prominent roles on television such as Trey MacDougal on \"Sex and the City\" (2000\u20132002), Orson Hodge on \"Desperate Housewives\" (2006\u20132012), The Captain on \"How I Met Your Mother\" (2010\u20132014) and \"How I Met Your Father\" (2022), the Mayor of Portland on \"Portlandia\" (2011\u20132018), Calvin Johnson on \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" (2014\u20132015), and Hank MacLean on \"Fallout\" (2024\u2013present).\nEarly life and education.\nMacLachlan was born Kyle McLachlan at Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital in Yakima, Washington. His mother, Catherine (\"n\u00e9e\" Stone; 1934\u20131986), was a public relations director for a school district and a homemaker who was active in community arts programs. His father, Kent Alan McLachlan (1933\u20132011), was a stockbroker and lawyer. Kyle has Scottish, German and Cornish ancestry. He grew up in Yakima as the eldest of three boys, alongside his younger brothers, Craig and Kent Jr. MacLachlan graduated from Eisenhower High School in Yakima. His mother left his father when he was 17, and his parents divorced in his senior year of high school.\nMacLachlan was introduced to stage acting by his mother when she became director of a youth theater program for teenagers that she helped set up in Yakima. She also sent him to piano lessons from the age of 9 to 14, when he also began to study classical singing. While in high school, he performed in plays and in class musicals, acting in his first play at age 15. In his senior year, he had the lead role of Brindsley Miller in a production of Peter Shaffer's one-act play \"Black Comedy\", and performed as Henry Higgins in \"My Fair Lady\". In 1982, he graduated cum laude with a BFA in drama from the University of Washington (UW) as a student of the Professional Actor Training Program. He initially planned to major in business and also studied classical voice at UW, but changed his focus to acting.\nCareer.\n1980s.\nThe first film MacLachlan worked on was \"The Changeling\" (1980), part of which was shot on the University of Washington campus. He was paid $10 as an extra.\nIn the summer of 1981, after his sophomore year at college, he played the lead in three roles at the Old Lyric Repertory Theatre in Logan, Utah, and the following summer with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon.\nMacLachlan made his film debut in \"Dune\" (1984) in the starring role of Paul Atreides. MacLachlan was performing in Moli\u00e8re's \"Tartuffe\" at a Seattle-area theater when a casting agent for \"Dune\" producer Dino De Laurentiis began searching for a young lead and received multiple recommendations for him. After several screen tests, he hit it off with director David Lynch, aided by their common Pacific Northwest backgrounds, and succeeded in winning the part. This marked the beginning of a creative partnership between MacLachlan and Lynch, who would go on to collaborate on four more projects before Lynch's death in 2025.\nAfter \"Dune\" flopped and met with poor reviews from critics, MacLachlan found it difficult to find work. He moved to Los Angeles in 1985, and auditioned for several films, including \"Top Gun\", but failed to win any roles, eventually dropping his agent.\nLynch cast MacLachlan in the starring role of Jeffrey Beaumont in \"Blue Velvet\" (1986), which was received more positively. Reflecting on his enduring relationship with Lynch in a 2012 interview, MacLachlan remarked: \"David Lynch plucked me from obscurity. He cast me as the lead in \"Dune\" and \"Blue Velvet\", and people have seen me as this boy-next-door-cooking-up-something-weird-in-the-basement ever since.\" Lynch biographer Chris Rodley described MacLachlan as an on-screen incarnation of Lynch's own persona.\nHe starred in the 1987 science fiction action film \"The Hidden\" as FBI agent Lloyd Gallagher.\n1990s.\nMacLachlan further collaborated with Lynch in the ABC television series \"Twin Peaks\" (1990\u201391), playing Special Agent Dale Cooper, reprising that role for Lynch's 1992 prequel film \"\". Lynch commented on those roles in a \"GQ\" story about MacLachlan: \"Kyle plays innocents who are interested in the mysteries of life. He's the person you trust enough to go into a strange world with.\" MacLachlan also said he considered Lynch one of his mentors that had a \"monumental impact\" on him. Lynch, who was known to allow his collaborative partners a large degree of control over their roles when working with him, rewrote scenes in \"Blue Velvet\" and \"Twin Peaks\" at the request of MacLachlan, who felt they were not right for his characters.\nMacLachlan appeared as musician Ray Manzarek in Oliver Stone's 1991 film \"The Doors\", about the band of the same name. He had previously turned down Stone's offer to play Chris in the 1986 movie \"Platoon\", which ultimately went to Charlie Sheen. Also, in 1991, he played the role of a killer in \"Tales from the Crypt\". In the 1993 film version of Franz Kafka's \"The Trial\", with a screenplay by Harold Pinter, MacLachlan played the lead role of the persecuted Josef K.\nMacLachlan co-starred with Samuel L. Jackson as a rookie prison guard in John Frankenheimer's 1994 Emmy-winning HBO film \"Against the Wall\" about the Attica prison riots. In 1994, he was also featured in \"The Flintstones\", a live-action movie adaptation of the animated sitcom of the same name, portraying Cliff Vandercave, the movie's main antagonist, opposite John Goodman as Fred Flintstone and Rick Moranis as Barney Rubble. \nIn 1995, MacLachlan starred in Paul Verhoeven's \"Showgirls\". The movie was heavily panned by critics, and it collected a record seven Golden Raspberry Awards. MacLachlan recalls that when he watched \"Showgirls\" for the first time before the premiere, he thought it was \"horrible\". But he later realised that the movie was \"inadvertently funny\" and embraced for its campiness. According to MacLachlan, although he skipped the movie's press tour, he had sat through the whole screening, contrary to reports that he walked out.\n2000s.\nFrom 2000 to 2002, MacLachlan had a recurring role in the American television series \"Sex and the City\", portraying Dr. Trey MacDougal, the one-time husband of Charlotte York (Kristin Davis). MacLachlan played King Claudius in the 2000 film \"Hamlet\" based on William Shakespeare's play. In the video game \"Grand Theft Auto III\" released in 2001, he voiced the character of the sociopathic real-estate developer Donald Love. In 2002, he made his West End debut in John Kolvenbach's \"On an Average Day\" with Woody Harrelson.\nIn 2003, MacLachlan made his Broadway debut as Aston in Harold Pinter's \"The Caretaker\" with Patrick Stewart. He portrayed the spirit of Cary Grant in the 2004 film \"Touch of Pink\". His resemblance to Grant had been previously noted in an episode of \"Twin Peaks\". That same year he also had a guest role in \"\", in which he played a psychiatrist who shot and killed a sociopathic child who had murdered his son. He was a guest star in the show again in 2011, as a politician whose son is involved in a rape accusation.\nIn 2006, after starring in the short-lived \"In Justice\", MacLachlan appeared in \"Desperate Housewives\" as the mysterious dentist Orson Hodge. He first appeared during the show's second season, and became a full-time cast member at the start of season three. In 2007, MacLachlan was one of the presenters at the London leg of Live Earth benefit concerts. He appeared in the 2008 film \"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2\". In the American English version of the cult 2006 Norwegian animated film \"Free Jimmy\" released in 2008, he voiced the character of \"Marius\", a militant animal rights activist.\n2010s.\nIn 2010, after four years of playing Orson Hodge, MacLachlan decided to leave \"Desperate Housewives\" as he found the commute from his home in New York City to the set in Los Angeles increasingly difficult since becoming a father in 2008. However, he returned as a guest star in 2012 for season eight, the final season of \"Desperate Housewives\". He also guest starred as George \"The Captain\" Van Smoot in seasons six, eight and nine of \"How I Met Your Mother\", from 2010 until 2014. He would reprise the role in the first season of the spinoff \"How I Met Your Father\" in 2022.\nFrom 2011 to 2018, he played the role of Mayor of Portland, Oregon, in the IFC comedy \"Portlandia\". In 2013 and 2014 he appeared as prosecutor Josh Perotti in four episodes of \"The Good Wife\". In 2014 and 2015 he appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe television series \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" as villain Calvin Johnson / The Doctor. In 2015, he voiced Riley Anderson's father in the Pixar animated feature \"Inside Out\". In January 2015, it was announced that MacLachlan would return as Special Agent Dale Cooper for the new limited television series \"Twin Peaks: The Return\", which debuted on May 21, 2017. In an interview, MacLachlan said he doesn't understand all of \"Twin Peaks\", and that fans understand it much more than him.\nIn 2018, MacLachlan starred as Isaac Izard, the main antagonist in the fantasy-horror family film \"The House with a Clock in its Walls\". In 2019, he appeared as a team owner in Steven Soderbergh's \"High Flying Bird\" which was shot entirely on the iPhone 8. Later that year, he co-starred in \"Carol's Second Act\", from the writers of \"Booksmart\". The series was canceled in 2020.\nAt the 11th Annual Governors Awards, held on October 27, 2019, MacLachlan and his \"Blue Velvet\" co-star Laura Dern paid tribute to their friend and collaborator David Lynch, who received an Academy Honorary Award for his work.\n2020s.\nIn 2020, he reunited with his \"Hamlet\" co-star Ethan Hawke, portraying Thomas Edison opposite Hawke's \"Tesla\". Later that year, he made an uncredited cameo appearance in HBO's \"How To with John Wilson\", which Vulture described as \"a glorious 14 seconds\". He then portrayed Franklin D. Roosevelt in \"Atlantic Crossing\", which aired on Masterpiece in 2021.\nIn 2022, MacLachlan co-starred with Jon Hamm in \"Confess, Fletch\" and was also cast as Chief Justice Earl Warren in \"Miranda's Victim\". From 2023 to 2024, he returned to voiceover work with a guest-starring role on Hulu's \"Futurama\" and reprised his role as Riley's dad in Pixar's \"Inside Out 2\" and Disney+'s \"Dream Productions.\"\nMacLachlan also co-hosted and co-created PodcastOne's \"Varnamtown\" podcast with Epic Magazine co-founder Joshua Davis. The true crime series explores Varnamtown, North Carolina's ties to Pablo Escobar. \nIn 2024, he was honored with the Canal+ Icon Award at Canneseries ahead of his role in Amazon's \"Fallout\", the adaptation of the popular video game series. It was quickly renewed for a second season in April 2024 followed by an early renewal for a third season in May 2025. \nIn September 2024, he was cast alongside Connie Britton in \"Overcompensating\", a college-set comedy series created by and starring Benito Skinner. The series premiered in May 2025 to positive reviews and was renewed for a second season in September 2025. \nIn January 2025, the WGAW announced that MacLachlan would posthumously present the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement to David Lynch, who had died earlier that month. MacLachlan had previously honored his longtime friend and collaborator with tributes in \"The New York Times\", \"GQ\" and on his personal Instagram account, where he wrote, \"I was willing to follow him anywhere because joining him on the journey of discovery, searching and finding together, was the whole point. I stepped out into the unknown because I knew David was floating out there with me. It's like Agent Cooper says to Sheriff Truman in \"Twin Peaks\": 'I have no idea where this will lead us, but I have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange.' I will miss my dear friend. He has made my world\u2014all of our worlds\u2014both wonderful and strange\".\nIn September 2025, MacLachlan appeared once again alongside his \"Hamlet\" and \"Tesla\" co-star Ethan Hawke in FX\u2019s \"The Lowdown\", a new series from \"Reservation Dogs\" creator Sterlin Harjo. That same month, MacLachlan launched his second podcast, \"What Are We Even Doing?\", a weekly series in which he interviews younger actors and artists about their creative processes. Distributed by iHeartRadio\u2019s Elvis Duran Podcast Network, the podcast has featured guests such as Kaia Gerber, Dylan O\u2019Brien, Benito Skinner, and Caleb Hearon.\nPersonal life.\nFamily.\nMacLachlan's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1986, aged 52, shortly before \"Blue Velvet\" was released. She had been diagnosed while he was filming \"Dune\" in 1983, and delayed informing him of the diagnosis. His father died of post-surgery complications in 2011.\nRelationships.\nMacLachlan dated his \"Blue Velvet\" co-star Laura Dern from 1985 to 1989. Subsequently, he was in a relationship with \"Twin Peaks\" co-star Lara Flynn Boyle from 1990 to 1992. In 1992, after his relationship with Boyle ended, he began a relationship with supermodel Linda Evangelista after they met at a photo shoot they did together for Barneys New York. According to MacLachlan, they had been engaged for a few years when their six-year relationship ended in 1998.\nMarriage.\nIn 1999, he met and began a relationship with publicist Desiree Gruber. Gruber runs her own public relations agency; she became an executive producer of \"Project Runway\" in 2004. MacLachlan moved to New York City because he was filming \"Sex and the City\" and Gruber was based there. They were married on April 20, 2002. Their son was born on July 25, 2008. The family has residences in Los Angeles and New York. \nWinemaking.\nMacLachlan, a wine lover, co-founded Pursued by Bear with vintner Eric Dunham in 2005 under Dunham Cellars in Walla Walla, Washington. The name, inspired by Shakespeare's \"The Winter's Tale\", comes from the stage direction \"Exit, pursued by a bear.\" Recognized as one of Washington's top-rated labels, Pursued by Bear produces five wines: Twin Bear, Pursued by Bear, Baby Bear, Blushing Bear, and Bear Cub.\nSocial media.\nIn 2024, MacLachlan\u2019s Instagram and TikTok accounts garnered attention for his engagement with viral trends and popular culture. His posts, which featured music and inspiration from artists like Lorde, Chappell Roan, and Charli XCX's \"Brat\", received positive reactions from the artists themselves. Multiple publications praised his ability to connect with a Gen-Z audience and affectionately elevated him to \"babygirl\" status.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Developed by Stephanie Kwolek at DuPont in 1965, the high-strength material was first used commercially in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires. It is typically spun into ropes or fabric sheets that can be used as such, or as an ingredient in composite material components.\nKevlar has many applications, ranging from bicycle tires and racing sails to bulletproof vests, due to its high tensile strength-to-weight ratio; by this measure it is five times stronger than steel. It is also used to make modern marching drumheads that withstand high impact, and for mooring lines and other underwater applications.\nA similar fiber, Twaron, with the same chemical structure was developed by Akzo in the 1970s. Commercial production started in 1986, and Twaron is manufactured by Teijin Aramid.\nHistory.\nPoly-paraphenylene terephthalamide (K29) \u2013 branded Kevlar \u2013 was invented by the American chemist Stephanie Kwolek while working for DuPont, in anticipation of a gasoline shortage. In 1964, her group began searching for a new lightweight strong fiber to use for light, but strong, tires. The polymers she had been working with, poly-p-phenylene-terephthalate and polybenzamide, formed liquid crystals in solution, something unique to polymers at the time.\nThe solution was \"cloudy, opalescent upon being stirred, and of low viscosity\" and usually was thrown away. However, Kwolek persuaded the technician, Charles Smullen, who ran the spinneret, to test her solution, and was amazed to find that the fiber did not break, unlike nylon. Her supervisor and her laboratory director understood the significance of her discovery and a new field of polymer chemistry quickly arose. By 1971, modern Kevlar was introduced. However, Kwolek was not very involved in developing the applications of Kevlar.\nIn 1971, Lester Shubin, who was then the director of Science and Technology for the National Institute for Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice, suggested using Kevlar to replace nylon in bullet-proof vests. Prior to the introduction of Kevlar, flak jackets made of nylon had provided much more limited protection to users. Shubin later recalled how the idea developed: \"We folded it over a couple of times and shot at it. The bullets didn't go through.\" In tests, they strapped Kevlar onto anesthetized goats and shot at their hearts, spinal cords, livers and lungs. They monitored the goats' heart rate and blood gas levels to check for lung injuries. After 24 hours, one goat died and the others had wounds that were not life threatening. Shubin received a $5 million grant to research the use of the fabric in bullet-proof vests.\nKevlar 149 was invented by Jacob Lahijani of Dupont in the 1980s.\nProduction.\nKevlar is synthesized in solution from the monomers 1,4-phenylene-diamine (\"para\"-phenylenediamine) and terephthaloyl chloride in a condensation reaction yielding hydrochloric acid as a byproduct. The result has liquid-crystalline behavior, and mechanical drawing orients the polymer chains in the fiber's direction. Hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) was the solvent initially used for the polymerization, but for safety reasons, DuPont replaced it by a solution of \"N\"-methyl-pyrrolidone and calcium chloride. As this process had been patented by Akzo (see above) in the production of Twaron, a patent war ensued.\nKevlar production is expensive because of the difficulties arising from using concentrated sulfuric acid, needed to keep the water-insoluble polymer in solution during its synthesis and spinning.\nSeveral grades of Kevlar are available:\nThe ultraviolet component of sunlight degrades and decomposes Kevlar, a problem known as \"UV degradation\", and so it is rarely used outdoors without protection against sunlight.\nStructure and properties.\nWhen Kevlar is spun, the resulting fiber has a tensile strength of about , and a relative density of 1.44 (0.052\u00a0lb/in3). The polymer owes its high strength to the many inter-chain bonds. These inter-molecular hydrogen bonds form between the carbonyl groups and N\"H\" centers. Additional strength is derived from aromatic stacking interactions between adjacent strands. These interactions have a greater influence on Kevlar than the van der Waals interactions and chain length that typically influence the properties of other synthetic polymers and fibers such as ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene. The presence of salts and certain other impurities, especially calcium, could interfere with the strand interactions and care is taken to avoid inclusion in its production. Kevlar's structure consists of relatively rigid molecules which tend to form mostly planar sheet-like structures rather like silk protein.\nThermal properties.\nKevlar maintains its strength and resilience down to cryogenic temperatures (): in fact, it is slightly stronger at low temperatures. At higher temperatures the tensile strength is immediately reduced by about 10\u201320%, and after some hours the strength progressively reduces further. For example: enduring for 500 hours, its strength is reduced by about 10%; and enduring for 70 hours, its strength is reduced by about 50%.\nApplications.\nScience.\nKevlar is often used in the field of cryogenics for its low thermal conductivity and high strength relative to other materials for suspension purposes. It is most often used to suspend a paramagnetic salt enclosure from a superconducting magnet mandrel in order to minimize any heat leaks to the paramagnetic material. It is also used as a thermal standoff or structural support where low heat leaks are desired.\nA thin Kevlar window has been used by the NA48 experiment at CERN to separate a vacuum vessel from a vessel at nearly atmospheric pressure, both in diameter. The window has provided vacuum tightness combined with reasonably small amount of material (only 0.3% to 0.4% of radiation length).\nProtection.\nKevlar is a well-known component of personal armor such as combat helmets, ballistic face masks, and ballistic vests. The PASGT helmet and vest that were used by United States military forces relied on Kevlar as a key component in their construction. Other military uses include bulletproof face masks and spall liners used to protect the crews of armoured fighting vehicles. \"Nimitz\"-class aircraft carriers use Kevlar reinforcement in vital areas. Civilian applications include high heat resistance uniforms worn by firefighters and body armour worn by police officers, security, and police tactical teams such as SWAT.\nKevlar is used in gloves, sleeves, jackets, chaps and other articles of clothing designed to protect users from cuts, abrasions, and heat. Kevlar-based protective gear is often considerably lighter and thinner than equivalent gear made of more traditional materials.\nIt is used in motorcycle safety clothing, especially in the areas featuring padding such as the shoulders and elbows. In the sport of fencing it is used in the protective jackets, breeches, plastrons and the bib of the masks. It is increasingly being used in the \"peto\", the padded covering that protects picadors' horses in the bullring. Speed skaters also frequently wear an under-layer of Kevlar fabric to prevent potential wounds from skates in the event of a fall or collision.\nSport.\nIn \"kyudo\", or Japanese archery, it may be used for bow strings, as an alternative to the more expensive hemp. It is one of the main materials used for paraglider suspension lines. It is used as an inner lining for some bicycle tires to prevent punctures. In table tennis, plies of Kevlar are added to custom ply blades, or paddles, in order to increase bounce and reduce weight. Tennis racquets are sometimes strung with Kevlar. It is used in sails for high performance racing boats.\nIn 2013, with advancements in technology, Nike used Kevlar in shoes for the first time. It launched the Elite II Series, with enhancements to its earlier version of basketball shoes by using Kevlar in the anterior as well as the shoe laces. This was done to decrease the elasticity of the tip of the shoe in contrast to the nylon conventionally used, as Kevlar expanded by about 1% against nylon which expanded by about 30%. Shoes in this range included LeBron, HyperDunk and Zoom Kobe VII. However these shoes were launched at a price range much higher than average cost of basketball shoes. It was also used in the laces for the Adidas F50 adiZero Prime football boot.\nSeveral companies, including Continental AG, manufacture cycle tires with Kevlar to protect against punctures.\nFolding-bead bicycle tires, introduced to cycling by The Michelin Elan tire in 1975, along with Mavic \"Module E\" hook-beaded rims, used Kevlar as a bead in place of steel for weight reduction and strength. A side effect of the folding bead is a reduction in shelf and floor space needed to display cycle tires in a retail environment, as they are folded and placed in small boxes.\nMusic.\nKevlar has also been found to have useful acoustic properties for loudspeaker cones, specifically for bass and mid range drive units. Additionally, Kevlar has been used as a strength member in fiber optic cables such as the ones used for audio data transmissions.\nKevlar can be used as an acoustic core on bows for string instruments. Kevlar's physical properties provide strength, flexibility, and stability for the bow's user. To date, the only manufacturer of this type of bow is CodaBow.\nKevlar is also presently used as a material for tailcords (tailpiece adjusters), which connect the tailpiece to the endpin of bowed string instruments.\nKevlar is sometimes used as a material on marching snare drums. It allows for an extremely high amount of tension, resulting in a cleaner sound. There is usually a resin poured onto the Kevlar to make the head airtight, and a nylon top layer to provide a flat striking surface. This is one of the primary types of marching snare drum heads. Remo's Falam Slam patch is made with Kevlar and is used to reinforce bass drum heads where the beater strikes.\nKevlar is used in the woodwind reeds of Fibracell. The material of these reeds is a composite of aerospace materials designed to duplicate the way nature constructs cane reed. Very stiff but sound absorbing Kevlar fibers are suspended in a lightweight resin formulation.\nMotor vehicles.\nKevlar is sometimes used in structural components of cars, especially high-value performance cars such as the Ferrari F40.\nThe chopped fiber has been used as a replacement for asbestos in brake pads. Aramids such as Kevlar release less airborne fibres than asbestos brakes and do not have the carcinogenic properties associated with asbestos.\nOther uses.\nWicks for fire dancing props are made of composite materials with Kevlar in them. Kevlar by itself does not absorb fuel very well, so it is blended with other materials such as fiberglass or cotton. Kevlar's high heat resistance allows the wicks to be reused many times.\nKevlar is sometimes used as a substitute for Teflon in some non-stick frying pans.\nKevlar fiber is used in rope and in cable, where the fibers are kept parallel within a polyethylene sleeve. The cables have been used in suspension bridges such as the bridge at Aberfeldy, Scotland. They have also been used to stabilize cracking concrete cooling towers by circumferential application followed by tensioning to close the cracks. Kevlar is widely used as a protective outer sheath for optical fiber cable, as its strength protects the cable from damage and kinking. When used in this application it is commonly known by the trademarked name Parafil.\nKevlar was used by scientists at Georgia Institute of Technology as a base textile for an experiment in electricity-producing clothing. This was done by weaving zinc oxide nanowires into the fabric. If successful, the new fabric will generate about 80 milliwatts per square meter.\nA retractable roof of over of Kevlar was a key part of the design of the Olympic Stadium, Montreal for the 1976 Summer Olympics. It was spectacularly unsuccessful, as it was completed 10 years late and replaced just 10 years later in May 1998 after a series of problems.\nKevlar can be found as a reinforcing layer in rubber bellows expansion joints and rubber hoses, for use in high temperature applications, and for its high strength. It is also found as a braid layer used on the outside of hose assemblies, to add protection against sharp objects.\nSome cellphones (including the Motorola RAZR Family, the Motorola Droid Maxx, OnePlus 2 and Pocophone F1) have a Kevlar backplate, chosen over other materials such as carbon fiber due to its resilience and lack of interference with signal transmission.\nThe Kevlar fiber/epoxy matrix composite materials can be used in marine current turbines (MCT) or wind turbines due to their high specific strength and light weight compared to other fibers.\nComposite materials.\nAramid fibers are widely used for reinforcing composite materials, often in combination with carbon fiber and glass fiber. The matrix for high performance composites is usually epoxy resin.

It was fought between the forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), which controlled Kosovo before the war, and the Kosovo Albanian separatist militia known as the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). The conflict ended when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) intervened by beginning air strikes in March 1999 which resulted in Yugoslav forces withdrawing from Kosovo.\nThe KLA was formed in the early 1990s to fight against the discrimination of ethnic Albanians and the repression of political dissent by the Serbian authorities, which started after the suppression of Kosovo's autonomy and other discriminatory policies against Albanians by Serbian leader Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in 1989. The KLA initiated its first campaign in 1995, after Kosovo's case was left out of the Dayton Agreement and it had become clear that President Rugova's strategy of peaceful resistance had failed to bring Kosovo onto the international agenda. In June 1996, the group claimed responsibility for acts of sabotage targeting Kosovo police stations, during the Kosovo Insurgency. In 1997, the organization acquired a large quantity of arms through weapons smuggling from Albania, following a rebellion in which weapons were looted from the country's police and army posts. In early 1998, KLA attacks targeting Yugoslav authorities in Kosovo resulted in an increased presence of Serb paramilitaries and regular forces who subsequently began pursuing a campaign of retribution targeting KLA sympathisers and political opponents; this campaign killed 1,500 to 2,000 civilians and KLA combatants, and had displaced 370,000 Kosovar Albanians by March 1999.\nOn 20 March 1999, Yugoslav forces began a massive campaign of repression and expulsions of Kosovar Albanians following the withdrawal of the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) and the failure of the proposed Rambouillet Agreement. In response to this, NATO intervened with an aerial bombing campaign that began on March 24, justifying it on humanitarian grounds. The war ended with the Kumanovo Agreement, signed on 9 June 1999, with Yugoslav and Serb forces agreeing to withdraw from Kosovo to make way for an international presence. NATO forces entered Kosovo on June 12. The NATO bombing campaign has remained controversial. It did not gain the approval of the UN Security Council and it caused at least 488 Yugoslav civilian deaths, including substantial deaths of Kosovar refugees.\nIn 2001, a UN administered Supreme Court based in Kosovo found that there had been a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments against the Albanian population, and that Yugoslav troops had tried to force them out of Kosovo, but not to eradicate them and therefore it was not genocide. After the war, a list was compiled which documented that over 13,500 people were killed or went missing during the two year conflict. The Yugoslav and Serb forces caused the displacement of between 1.2 million and 1.45 million Kosovo Albanians. After the war, around 200,000 Serbs, Romani, and other non-Albanians fled Kosovo and many of the remaining civilians were victims of abuse.\nThe Kosovo Liberation Army disbanded soon after the end of the war, with some of its members going on to fight for the U\u00c7PMB in the Pre\u0161evo Valley and others joining the National Liberation Army (NLA) and Albanian National Army (ANA) during the armed ethnic conflict in Macedonia, while others went on to form the Kosovo Police.\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) convicted six Serb/Yugoslav officials and one Albanian commander for war crimes.\nBackground.\nThe modern Albanian-Serbian conflict has its roots in the expulsion of Albanians in 1877\u20131878 from areas that were incorporated into the Principality of Serbia. Muslim Albanians residing in the Sanjak of Ni\u0161 were quickly expelled after Ottomans had lost control of the region. Modern estimates put the number of expelled Albanians to 50,000\u2013130,000 Albanian refugees. As a result, some Albanian refugees who settled in Kosovo retaliated by attacking the local Serb population. From 1830 to 1876, there had also been a forced migration of up to 150,000 Albanians from the Principality. The conflict became more intense at the end of the 19th century, and in 1901 there were massacres of Serbs by Albanians in Ibarski Kola\u0161in using weapons not handed back to the Ottomans following the Greco-Turkish War of 1897.\nTensions between the Serbian and Albanian communities in Kosovo simmered throughout the 20th century and occasionally erupted into major violence, particularly during the First Balkan War (1912\u20131913), World War I (1914\u20131918), and World War II (1939\u20131945). The Albanian revolt of 1912 in Kosovo resulted in the Ottoman Empire agreeing to the creation of an Albanian quasi-state but Ottoman forces were soon driven out by opportunistic Bulgarian, Serbian and Montenegrin troops. In the ensuing Balkan Wars, at least 50,000 Albanians were massacred in the present-day territory of Kosovo by the Serbian regular army and irregular Komitadjis with the intention of manipulating population statistics before the borders of Albania were recognized during the London Conference of 1912\u20131913, after the latter proposed the drawing of the borders of Albania based on ethnic statistics. Multiple historians, scholars, and contemporary accounts refer to or characterize the massacres as: localized genocide, extermination, genocide of Albanians or part of the wider genocide against Muslims.\nAfter World War I Kosovo was incorporated into the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Yugoslavia despite the Albanian community's demands for union with Albania. Albanian rebels started the Drenica-Dukagjin Uprisings, which ended with the rebellion being crushed after the fall of the government of Fan Noli in Albania in December 1924 and the subsequent withdrawal of support for the Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo by President Zog. Between 1918 and 1939, Yugoslavia expelled hundreds of thousands of Albanians and promoted the settlement of mostly Serb colonists in the region, while Albanian language schools were prohibited. After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, most of Kosovo was assigned to Italian-controlled Albania, with the rest being controlled by Germany and Bulgaria. During the occupation, Albanian collaborators persecuted Serb and Montenegrin settlers, with thousands killed and between 70,000 and 100,000 expelled from Kosovo or sent to concentration camps in order to Albanianize the province. The return of the expelled colonists was made next to impossible by a decree from Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, followed by a new law in August 1945, which disallowed the return of colonists who had taken land from Albanian peasants.\nKosovo in Tito's Yugoslavia (1945\u20131980).\nThe end of World War II saw Kosovo returning to Yugoslav control. The new socialist government under Josip Broz Tito systematically suppressed nationalism among the ethnic groups throughout Yugoslavia, and established six republics (Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina) as constituent parts of the Yugoslav federation. Tito diluted the power of Serbia\u00a0\u2013 the largest and most populous republic\u00a0\u2013 by establishing autonomous governments in the Serbian province of Vojvodina in the north and Kosovo in the south. Until 1963, the region was named the Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija and in 1968 it was renamed to the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo.\nThe period of 1948\u20131963 in Kosovo was characterized by a brutal crackdown against Albanian nationalists by Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107 and his secret police (the UDBA). In 1955, a state of emergency was declared in order to quell unrest that had purportedly been instigated by terror groups from Albania. Following Rankovi\u0107's ouster in 1966, Tito and his League of Communists Party granted more powers to republics and attempted to improve the political, social and economic situation in Kosovo. In November 1968, large-scale demonstrations took place in Kosovo which were quelled by Yugoslav forces, precipitated by Albanian demands for separate republics in Kosovo and Macedonia. Albanian students and intellectuals pushed for an Albanian-language university and greater representative powers for Albanians in both the Serbian and Yugoslav state bodies.\nThe University of Pristina was established as an independent institution in 1970, ending a long period when the institution had been run as an outpost of University of Belgrade. The lack of Albanian-language educational materials in Yugoslavia hampered Albanian education in Kosovo, so an agreement was struck with Albania itself to supply textbooks.\nIn 1969 the Serbian Orthodox Church ordered its clergy to compile data on the ongoing problems of Serbs in Kosovo, seeking to pressure the government in Belgrade to do more to protect the interests of Serbs there.\nIn 1974 Kosovo's political status improved further when a new Yugoslav constitution granted an expanded set of political rights. Along with Vojvodina, Kosovo was declared a province and gained many of the powers of a fully-fledged republic: a seat on the federal presidency and its own assembly, police force and national bank. While trying to balance the interests of Albanians and Serbs, this effectively stratified both communities and prompted Serb fears of Kosovo seceding from Yugoslavia. Student demonstrations continued throughout the 1970s, resulting in the imprisonment of many members of the Albanian National Liberation Movement, including Adem Dema\u00e7i. The political and administrative changes that began in 1968 resulted in Kosovo Albanians securing complete control over the province's political, social and cultural issues as well as growing ties between Kosovo and Albania. However, by 1980, economic impoverishment would become the catalyst for further unrest.\nAfter the death of Tito (1980\u20131989).\nProvincial power was still exercised by the League of Communists of Kosovo, but now devolved mainly to ethnic Albanian communists. Tito's death on 4 May 1980 ushered in a long period of political instability, worsened by growing economic crisis and nationalist unrest. The first major outbreak occurred in Kosovo's main city, Pristina, when a protest of University of Pristina students over long queues in their university canteen rapidly escalated and in late March and early April 1981 spread throughout Kosovo, causing mass demonstrations in several towns, the 1981 protests in Kosovo. The disturbances were quelled by the Presidency of Yugoslavia proclaiming a state of emergency, sending in riot police and the army, which resulted in numerous casualties.\nIn 1981 it was reported that some 4,000 Serbs moved from Kosovo to central Serbia after the Kosovo Albanian riots in March that resulted in several Serb deaths and the desecration of Serbian Orthodox architecture and graveyards. Serbia reacted with a plan to reduce the power of Albanians in the province and a propaganda campaign that claimed Serbs were being pushed out of the province primarily by the growing Albanian population, rather than the bad state of the economy. 33 nationalist formations were dismantled by Yugoslav police, who sentenced some 280 people (800 fined, 100 under investigation) and seized arms caches and propaganda material. Albanian leaders of Kosovo maintained that Serbs were leaving mainly because of the poor economy. The worsening state of Kosovo's economy made the province a poor choice for Serbs seeking work. Albanians, as well as Serbs, tended to favor their compatriots when hiring new employees, but the number of jobs was too few for the population. Kosovo was the poorest entity of Yugoslavia: the average per capita income was $795, compared with the national average of $2,635. Due to its comparative poverty it received substantial amounts of Yugoslav development money, leading to quarrels amongst the republics regarding its quantity and utilization.\nIn February 1982 a group of priests from Serbia proper petitioned their bishops to ask \"why the Serbian Church is silent\" and why it did not campaign against \"the destruction, arson and sacrilege of the holy shrines of Kosovo\". In 1985, two Albanian farmers were falsely accused for the \u0110or\u0111e Martinovi\u0107 incident, which turned into a \"cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre\" in Serbian politics and fueled hatred towards Albanians. In 1987, Aziz Kelmendi, an ethnic-Albanian recruit in the Yugoslav Army (JNA) killed four fellow soldiers in a mass shooting in JNA barracks, with only one of them being an ethnic Serb. Serbian media blamed Albanian nationalism for the event and in response, Yugoslavia sent 400 federal police officers to Kosovo. It was against this tense background that the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) conducted a survey of Serbs who had left Kosovo in 1985 and 1986, which concluded that a considerable number had left under pressure from Albanians.\nThe so-called SANU Memorandum, leaked in September 1986, was a draft document that focused on the political difficulties facing Serbs in Yugoslavia, pointing to Tito's deliberate hobbling of Serbia's power and the difficulties faced by Serbs outside Serbia proper. It paid special attention to Kosovo, arguing that the Kosovo Serbs were being subjected to \"physical, political, legal and cultural genocide\" in an \"open and total war\" that had been ongoing since the spring of 1981. It claimed that Kosovo's status in 1986 was a worse historical defeat for the Serbs than any event since liberation from the Ottomans in 1804, thus ranking it above such catastrophes as the World war occupations. The Memorandum's authors claimed that 200,000 Serbs had moved out of the province over the previous 20 years and warned that there would soon be none left \"unless things changed radically.\" The remedy, according to the Memorandum, was for \"genuine security and unambiguous equality for all peoples living in Kosovo and Metohija [to be] established\" and \"objective and permanent conditions for the return of the expelled [Serbian] nation [to be] created.\" It concluded that \"Serbia must not be passive and wait and see what the others will say, as it has done so often in the past.\" The SANU Memorandum provoked split reactions: Albanians saw it as a call for Serbian supremacy at the local level, claiming the Serb emigrants had left Kosovo for economic reasons, while the Slovenes and Croats saw a threat in the call for a more assertive Serbia. Serbs were divided: many welcomed it, while the Communist old guard strongly attacked its message. One of those who denounced it was Serbian Communist Party official Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107.\nIn April 1987, Serbian President Ivan Stamboli\u0107 and Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 visited Kosovo with the intention of reducing tensions in the region. A Serb nationalist crowd had gathered near the hall where Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was supposed to deliver his speech in Kosovo Polje. The crowd tried to break through the police cordon that was providing security for the gathering, and after clashing with the police, they chanted that Albanian policemen were beating them. Informed of the situation, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 walked out of the building and addressed the protesters, telling them \"No one will beat you again\". He further called upon the crowd to resist the Albanian pressure to leave Kosovo. This speech marked the beginning of Milo\u0161evi\u0107's use of nationalism to gain power, and he was appointed President of the Presidency of Serbia in May 1989.\nIn November 1988 Kosovo's head of the provincial committee was arrested. In March 1989 Milo\u0161evi\u0107 announced an \"anti-bureaucratic revolution\" in Kosovo and Vojvodina, curtailing their autonomy as well as imposing a curfew and a state of emergency in Kosovo due to violent demonstrations, resulting in 24 deaths (including two policemen). Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and his government claimed that the constitutional changes were necessary to protect Kosovo's remaining Serbs against harassment from the Albanian majority.\nConstitutional amendments (1989\u201394).\nOn 17 November 1988 Kaqusha Jashari and Azem Vllasi were forced to resign from the leadership of the League of Communists of Kosovo (LCK). In early 1989 the Serbian Assembly proposed amendments to the Constitution of Serbia that would remove the word \"Socialist\" from the Serbian Republic's title, establish multi-party elections, remove the independence of institutions of the autonomous provinces such as Kosovo and rename Kosovo as the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija. In February Kosovar Albanians demonstrated in large numbers against the proposal, emboldened by striking miners. Serbs in Belgrade protested against the Kosovo Albanian's separatism. On 3 March 1989 the Presidency of Yugoslavia imposed special measures assigning responsibility for public security to the federal government. On 23 March the Assembly of Kosovo voted to accept the proposed amendments although most Albanian delegates abstained. In early 1990 Kosovar Albanians held mass demonstrations against the special measures, which were lifted on 18 April 1990 and responsibility for public security was again assigned to Serbia.\nOn 26 June 1990 Serbian authorities barred access to the building of the Kosovo Assembly, citing special circumstances. On 2 July 1990, 114 ethnic Albanian delegates of the 180-member Kosovo Assembly gathered in front of the closed building and declared Kosovo an independent republic within Yugoslavia. On 5 July the Serbian Assembly dissolved the Kosovo Assembly. Serbia also dissolved the provincial executive council and assumed full and direct control of the province. Serbia took over management of Kosovo's principal Albanian-language media, halting Albanian-language broadcasts. On 4 September 1990 Kosovar Albanians observed a 24-hour general strike, virtually shutting down the province. On 5 August 1991, the Serbian Assembly suspended the main Albanian-language daily newspaper, \"Rilindja\", declaring its journalism unconstitutional.\nOn 7 September 1990 the Constitution of Kosovo was promulgated by Albanian members of the disbanded Assembly of Kosovo. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 responded by ordering the arrest of the deputies that participated in the meeting. The new controversial Serbian Constitution was promulgated on 28 September 1990. In September 1991, Kosovar Albanians held an unofficial referendum in which they voted overwhelmingly for independence. On 24 May 1992 Kosovar Albanians held unofficial elections for an assembly and president of the Republic of Kosovo and elected Ibrahim Rugova as president.\nDuring this time, the Republic of Kosova started to establish parallel institutions, which were not recognized by Serbia. The presence of Serbian security structures in Kosovo increased considerably and Kosovo was put into constant curfews. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians were fired from government and state-run institutions. By 1990 most Albanian schools were closed and the Serbian government required Albanian teachers to sign loyalty oaths in order to remain employed, effectively asking them to recognize Serbia, and not Republic of Kosova as their country, which the vast majority refused to sign. By 1991 all Albanian schoolteachers and academic staff had been dismissed and a parallel education system was established by the government of the Republic of Kosova, using donated private homes as classrooms. 350,000 Albanians emigrated out of the region due to economic and social pressures over the next seven years, and the Milosevic regime encouraged Serb settlement to the region. United Nations Special Rapporteur Tadeusz Mazowiecki reported on 26 February 1993 that the police had intensified their repression of the Albanian population since 1990, including depriving them of their basic rights, destroying their education system, and conducting large numbers of political dismissals of civil servants.\nMilosevic ordered the abolishment of the Academy of Sciences in Kosovo, Albanian street names were changed to Serbian ones, Serbs were allowed to enter the University of Pristina and therefore received preferential treatment, and Albanians were fired from their posts or lost their homes to Serbs (130,000 between 1990 and 1995).\nEruption of war.\nThe slide to war (1995\u20131998).\nAccording to an Amnesty International report in 1998, due to dismissals from the Yugoslav government it was estimated that by 1998 unemployment rate in the Kosovar Albanian population was higher than 70%. The economic apartheid imposed by Belgrade was aimed at impoverishing an already poor Kosovo Albanian population.\nIn 1996, 16,000 Serb refugees from Bosnia and Croatia were settled in Kosovo by the Milosevic government, sometimes against their will.\nIbrahim Rugova, first President of the Republic of Kosovo pursued a policy of passive resistance which succeeded in maintaining peace in Kosovo during the earlier wars in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia during the early 1990s. As evidenced by the emergence of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), this came at the cost of increasing frustration among Kosovo's Albanian population. In the mid-1990s, Rugova pleaded for a United Nations peacekeeping force for Kosovo.\nContinuing repression convinced many Albanians that only armed resistance would change the situation. On 22 April 1996, four attacks on Serbian security personnel were carried out almost simultaneously in different parts of Kosovo. The KLA, a hitherto-unknown organisation, subsequently claimed responsibility. The nature of the KLA was at first mysterious. It initially seemed that their only goals were to stop repression from Yugoslav authorities. KLA goals also included the establishment of a Greater Albania, a state stretching into surrounding Macedonia, Montenegro and southern Serbia. In July 1998, in an interview for Der Spiegel, KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi publicly announced that the KLA's goal was the unification of all Albanian-inhabited lands. Sulejman Selimi, a General Commander of KLA in 1998\u20131999, said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is \"de facto\" Albanian nation. The tragedy is that European powers after World War I decided to divide that nation between several Balkan states. We are now fighting to unify the nation, to liberate all Albanians, including those in Macedonia, Montenegro, and other parts of Serbia. We are not just a liberation army for Kosovo.\nWhile Rugova promised to uphold the minority rights of Serbs in Kosovo, the KLA was much less tolerant. Selimi stated that \"Serbs who have blood on their hands would have to leave Kosovo\".\nThe crisis escalated in December 1997 at the Peace Implementation Council meeting in Bonn, where the international community (as defined in the Dayton Agreement) agreed to give the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina sweeping powers, including the right to dismiss elected leaders. At the same time, Western diplomats insisted that Kosovo be discussed and that Yugoslavia be responsive to Albanian demands there. The delegation from Yugoslavia stormed out of the meetings in protest. This was followed by the return of the Contact Group that oversaw the last phases of the Bosnian conflict and declarations from European powers demanding that Yugoslavia solve the problem in Kosovo.\nThe KLA received financial and material support from the Kosovo Albanian diaspora. In early 1997, Albania collapsed into chaos following the fall of President Sali Berisha. Albanian Armed Forces stockpiles were looted with impunity by criminal gangs, with much of the hardware ending up in western Kosovo and boosting the growing KLA arsenal. Bujar Bukoshi, shadow prime minister in exile (in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland), created a group called FARK (Armed Forces of the Republic of Kosova). FARK and the KLA were initially rivals, but later FARK merged into the KLA. The Yugoslav government considered the KLA to be \"terrorists\" and \"insurgents\" who indiscriminately attacked police and civilians, while most Albanians saw the KLA as \"freedom fighters\".\nOn 23 February 1998, the United States Special Envoy to the Balkans, Robert Gelbard, stated in Pristina that \"the KLA was without any question a terrorist group.\" He later told the House Committee on International Relations that \"while the KLA had committed 'terrorist acts,' it had 'not been classified legally by the U.S. Government as a terrorist organization.'\" However, his 23 February statements have been seen as an unwitting \"green light\" to the Serbian crackdown that followed less than a week later.\nWar begins.\nKLA attacks intensified, centering on the Drenica valley area with the compound of Adem Jashari being a focal point during the first attack on Prekaz in 22 January, where Yugoslav security forces were repelled in an attack on the compound, and were driven out of the village the next day by thousands of Jashari's supporters. Days after Robert Gelbard described the KLA as a terrorist group, Serbian police responded to the KLA attacks in the Liko\u0161ane area, and pursued some of the KLA to \u010cirez, resulting in the deaths of four Serbian policemen, 16 Albanian fighters and 26 civilians in the attacks on Likoshane and \u00c7irez. The KLA's goal was to merge its Drenica stronghold with their stronghold in Albania proper, and this would shape the first few months of the fighting.\nSerb police then began to pursue Adem Jashari and his followers in the village of Donje Prekaze. After the failure of the first attempt on the Jashair compound in January, on 5 March 1998 a much larger attack on the Jashari compound in Prekaz led to the massacre of 60 Albanians, of which eighteen were women and ten were under the age of sixteen. The event provoked massive condemnation from western capitals. Madeleine Albright said that \"this crisis is not an internal affair of the FRY\".\nOn 24 March, Yugoslav forces surrounded the village of Glodjane and attacked a rebel compound there. Despite superior firepower, the Yugoslav forces failed to destroy the KLA unit, which had been their objective. Although there were deaths and severe injuries on the Albanian side, the insurgency in Glodjane was far from stamped out. The village was in fact to become one of the strongest centres of resistance in the upcoming war.\nA new Yugoslav government was formed at this time, led by the Socialist Party of Serbia and the Serbian Radical Party. Ultra-nationalist Radical Party chairman Vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj became a deputy prime minister. This increased the dissatisfaction with the country's position among Western diplomats and spokespersons.\nIn early April, Serbia arranged for a referendum on the issue of foreign interference in Kosovo. Serbian voters decisively rejected foreign interference in the crisis. Meanwhile, the KLA claimed much of the area in and around De\u00e7an and ran a territory based in the village of Glodjane, encompassing its surroundings.\nOn 21 April 1998, Yugoslav forces started shelling the village of Baballoq. The KLA, composed of 140 volunteers from the village and other KLA soldiers set up a defensive line which stopped the Yugoslav advance. The fighting lasted until August 1998 and started the Frontal War in the Dukagjini region.\nOn 31 May 1998, the Yugoslav army and the Serb Ministry of the Interior police began an operation to clear the border of the KLA. NATO's response to this offensive was mid-June's Operation Determined Falcon, a NATO show of force over the Yugoslav borders.\nDuring this time, Yugoslav President Milo\u0161evi\u0107 reached an arrangement with Boris Yeltsin of Russia to stop offensive operations and prepare for talks with the Albanians, who refused to talk to the Serbian side throughout the crisis, but would talk with the Yugoslav government. In fact, the only meeting between Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and Ibrahim Rugova happened on 15 May in Belgrade, two days after the special presidential envoy Richard Holbrooke announced that it would take place. Holbrooke threatened Milo\u0161evi\u0107 that if he did not obey, \"what's left of your country will implode\". A month later, Holbrooke visited the border areas affected by the fighting in early June, where he was famously photographed with the KLA. The publication of these images sent a signal to the KLA, its supporters and sympathisers, and to observers in general, that the US was decisively backing the KLA and the Albanian population in Kosovo.\nThe Yeltsin agreement required Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to allow international representatives to set up a mission in Kosovo to monitor the situation there. The Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission (KDOM) began operations in early July 1998. The US government welcomed this part of the agreement, but denounced the initiative's call for a mutual cease fire. Rather, the US demanded that the Serbian-Yugoslavian side should cease fire \"without linkage\u00a0... to a cessation in terrorist activities\". \nAll through June and into mid-July, the KLA maintained its advance. The KLA surrounded Peja and Gjakova, and set up an interim capital in the town of Malisheva (north of Rahovec). KLA troops infiltrated Suva Reka and the northwest of Pristina. They moved on to capture the Bela\u0107evac coal pits in late June, threatening energy supplies in the region. In July, KLA activity was reported south of Prizren. Their tactics as usual focused mainly on guerrilla and mountain warfare, and harassing and ambushing Yugoslav forces and Serb police patrols.\nThe tide turned in mid-July when the KLA captured Rahovec. On 17 July 1998, two nearby villages, Retimlije and Opteru\u0161a, were also captured, while less systematic events took place in the larger Serb-populated village of Velika Ho\u010da. The Orthodox monastery of Zo\u010di\u0161te was looted and torched. This led to a series of Serb and Yugoslav offensives which would continue into the beginning of August.\nA new set of KLA attacks in mid-August triggered Yugoslavian operations in south-central Kosovo, south of the Pristina-Peja road. In early September, Yugoslav forces began an offensive around Prizren but, despite their advantage in firepower, were unable to capture the KLA stronghold there. In western Kosovo, around Peja, another offensive caused condemnation as international officials expressed fear that a large column of displaced people would be attacked.\nIn early mid-September, for the first time, KLA activity was reported in northern Kosovo around Podujevo. Finally, in late September, a Yugoslav determined effort was made to clear the KLA out of the northern and central parts of Kosovo and out of the Drenica valley. During this time many threats were made from Western capitals but these were tempered somewhat by the elections in Bosnia, as they did not want Serbian Democrats and Radicals to win. Following the elections, the threats intensified once again. On 28 September, the mutilated corpses of a family were discovered by KDOM outside the village of Gornje Obrinje. The bloody image of a child's doll and streams of displaced persons rallied the international community to action.\nMorale.\nMorale was a serious problem for Serb forces; intelligence surveys found that many soldiers disagreed with their comrades' actions. One tank commander reported, \"for the entire time I was in Kosovo, I never saw an enemy soldier and my unit was never once involved in firing at enemy targets. The tanks which cost $2.5 million each were used to slaughter Albanian children... I am ashamed\".\nWhen retreating from Kosovo after NATO intervention, Yugoslav units appeared combat effective with high morale and displaying large holdings of undamaged equipment. Weeks before the end of hostilities, David Fromkin noted that \"it seemed possible that NATO unity might crack before Yugoslav morale did.\" The announcement by President Clinton that the US would not deploy ground troops gave a tremendous boost to Serbian morale.\nUN, NATO, and OSCE (1998\u20131999).\nOn 9 June 1998, US President Bill Clinton declared a \"national emergency\" (state of emergency) due to the \"unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States\" imposed by Yugoslavia and Serbia over the Kosovo War.\nOn 23 September 1998, acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1199. This expressed 'grave concern' at reports reaching the Secretary General that over 230,000 people had been displaced from their homes by 'the excessive and indiscriminate use of force by Serbian security forces and the Yugoslav Army', demanding that all parties in Kosovo and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia cease hostilities and maintain a ceasefire. On 24 September the North Atlantic Council (NAC) of NATO issued an \"activation warning\" taking NATO to an increased level of military preparedness for both a limited air option and a phased air campaign in Kosovo. The other major issue for those who saw no option but to resort to the use of force was the estimated 250,000 displaced Albanians, 30,000 of whom were out in the woods, without warm clothing or shelter, with winter fast approaching.\nMeanwhile, the US Ambassador to the Republic of Macedonia, Christopher Hill, was leading shuttle diplomacy between an Albanian delegation, led by Rugova, and the Yugoslav and Serbian authorities. These meetings were shaping the peace plan to be discussed during a period of planned NATO occupation of Kosovo. During a period of two weeks, threats intensified, culminating in NATO's Activation Order being given. NATO was ready to begin airstrikes, and Richard Holbrooke went to Belgrade in the hope of reaching an agreement with Milo\u0161evi\u0107. Officially, the international community demanded an end to fighting. It specifically demanded that Yugoslavia end its offensives against the KLA whilst attempting to convince the KLA to drop its bid for independence. Attempts were made to persuade Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to permit NATO peacekeeping troops to enter Kosovo. This, they argued, would allow for the Christopher Hill peace process to proceed and yield a peace agreement.\nOn 13 October 1998, the North Atlantic Council issued activation orders for the execution of both limited air strikes and a phased air campaign in Yugoslavia which would begin in approximately 96 hours. On 15 October the NATO Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) Agreement for a ceasefire was signed, and the deadline for withdrawal was extended to 27 October. Difficulties implementing the agreement were reported, as clashes continued between government troops and the guerrillas. The Serbian withdrawal commenced on or around 25 October 1998, and Operation Eagle Eye commenced on 30 October.\nThe KVM was a large contingent of unarmed Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) peace monitors (officially known as verifiers) that moved into Kosovo. Their inadequacy was evident from the start. They were nicknamed the \"clockwork oranges\" in reference to their brightly coloured vehicles. Fighting resumed in December 1998 after both sides broke the ceasefire, and this surge in violence culminated in the killing of Zvonko Bojani\u0107, the Serb mayor of the town of Kosovo Polje. Yugoslav authorities responded by launching a crackdown against KLA militants.\nThe January to March 1999 phase of the war brought increasing insecurity in urban areas, including bombings and murders. Such attacks took place during the Rambouillet talks in February and as the Kosovo Verification Agreement unraveled in March. Killings on the roads continued and increased. There were military confrontations in, among other places, the Vushtrri area in February and the heretofore unaffected Ka\u00e7anik area in early March.\nOn 15 January 1999 the Ra\u010dak massacre occurred when 45 Kosovan Albanians were killed. The bodies had been discovered by OSCE monitors, including Head of Mission William G. Walker, and foreign news correspondents. Yugoslavia denied a massacre took place. The Ra\u010dak massacre was the culmination of the conflict between the KLA and Yugoslav forces that had continued throughout the winter of 1998\u20131999. The incident was immediately condemned as a massacre by the Western countries and the United Nations Security Council, and later became the basis of one of the charges of war crimes leveled against Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and his top officials. This massacre was the turning point of the war. NATO decided that the conflict could only be settled by introducing a military peacekeeping force under the auspices of NATO, to forcibly restrain the two sides. Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, had been subjected to heavy firefights and segregation according to OSCE reports.\nThe Rambouillet Conference (January\u2013March 1999).\nOn 30 January 1999, NATO issued a statement announcing that the North Atlantic Council had agreed that \"the NATO Secretary General may authorise air strikes against targets on FRY territory\" to \"[compel] compliance with the demands of the international community and [to achieve] a political settlement\". While this was mainly a threat to the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 government, it also included a coded threat to the Albanians: any decision would depend on the \"position and actions of the Kosovo Albanian leadership and all Kosovo Albanian armed elements in and around Kosovo.\"\nAlso on 30 January 1999, the Contact Group issued a set of \"non-negotiable principles\" which made up a package known as \"Status Quo Plus\"\u00a0\u2013 effectively the restoration of Kosovo's pre-1990 autonomy within Serbia, plus the introduction of democracy and supervision by international organisations. It also called for a peace conference to be held in February 1999 at the Ch\u00e2teau de Rambouillet, outside Paris.\nThe Rambouillet talks began on 6 February 1999, with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana negotiating with both sides. They were intended to conclude by 19 February. The FR Yugoslavian delegation was led by then president of Serbia Milan Milutinovi\u0107, while Milo\u0161evi\u0107 himself remained in Belgrade. This was in contrast to the 1995 Dayton conference that ended the war in Bosnia, where Milo\u0161evi\u0107 negotiated in person. The absence of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was interpreted as a sign that the real decisions were being made back in Belgrade, a move that aroused criticism in Yugoslavia as well as abroad; Kosovo's Serbian Orthodox bishop Artemije traveled all the way to Rambouillet to protest that the delegation was wholly unrepresentative. At this time, speculation about an indictment of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 for war crimes was rife, so his absence may have been motivated by fear of arrest.\nThe first phase of negotiations was successful. In particular, a statement was issued by the Contact Group co-chairmen on 23 February 1999 that the negotiations \"have led to a \"consensus\" on substantial autonomy for Kosovo, including on mechanisms for free and fair elections to democratic institutions, for the governance of Kosovo, for the protection of human rights and the rights of members of national communities; and for the establishment of a fair judicial system\". They went on to say that \"a political framework is now in place\", leaving the further work of finalising \"the implementation Chapters of the Agreement, including the modalities of the \"invited international\" civilian and military presence in Kosovo\". While the Serbs agreed to an autonomous government, free elections, and the release of all political prisoners, the West also insisted on the presence of NATO troops.\nWhile the accords did not fully satisfy the Albanians, they were much too radical for the Yugoslavs, who responded by substituting a drastically revised text that even Russia (ally of FR Yugoslavia) found unacceptable. It sought to reopen the painstakingly negotiated political status of Kosovo and deleted all of the proposed implementation measures. Among many other changes in the proposed new version, it eliminated the entire chapter on humanitarian assistance and reconstruction, removed virtually all international oversight and dropped any mention of invoking \"the will of the people [of Kosovo]\" in determining the final status of the province.\nOn 18 March 1999, the Albanian, US, and British delegations signed what became known as the Rambouillet Accords, while the Yugoslav and Russian delegations refused. The accords called for NATO administration of Kosovo as an autonomous province within Yugoslavia, a force of 30,000 NATO troops to maintain order in Kosovo; an unhindered right of passage for NATO troops on Yugoslav territory, including Kosovo; and immunity for NATO and its agents to Yugoslav law. They would have also permitted a continuing Yugoslav army presence of 1,500 troops for border monitoring, backed by up to 1,000 troops to perform command and support functions, as well as a small number of border police, 2,500 ordinary MUP for public security purposes (although these were expected to draw down and to be transformed), and 3,000 local police.\nAlthough the Yugoslav Government cited military provisions of Appendix B of the Rambouillet provisions as the reason for its objections, claiming that it was an unacceptable violation of Yugoslavia's sovereignty, these provisions were essentially the same as had been applied to Bosnia for the SFOR (Stabilisation Force) mission there after the Dayton Agreement in 1995. The two sides did not discuss the issue in detail because of their disagreements on more fundamental problems. In particular, the Serb side rejected the idea of any NATO troop presence in Kosovo to replace their security forces, preferring unarmed UN observers. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 himself had refused to discuss the annex after informing NATO that it was unacceptable, even after he was asked to propose amendments to the provisions which would have made them acceptable.\nAfter the failure at Rambouillet and the alternative Yugoslav proposal, international monitors from the OSCE withdrew on 22 March, to ensure their safety ahead of the anticipated NATO bombing campaign. On 23 March, the Serbian assembly accepted the principle of autonomy for Kosovo, as well as the non-military aspects of the agreement, but rejected a NATO troop presence.\nIn a 2009 judgement regarding six former Serb leaders charged with war crimes in Kosovo, the ICTY noted that the causes of the breakdown in the negotiations at Rambouillet were complex and stated that \"international negotiators did not take an entirely even-handed approach to the respective positions of the parties and tended to favour the Kosovo Albanians.\" It further recorded that, according to a witness, on 14 April 1999, at a meeting initiated by the White House with representatives of the Serbian-American community, President Bill Clinton had stated that \"the provision for allowing a referendum for the Albanians in Kosovo went too far and that, if he were in the shoes of Milo\u0161evi\u0107, he probably would not have signed the draft [Rambouillet] agreement either.\"\nNATO bombing timeline.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe are not going to war, but we are called upon to implement a peaceful solution in Kosovo, including by military means!\n \u2014 German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's announcement to the German people on 24 March 1999.\nOn 23 March 1999 at 21:30 UTC, Richard Holbrooke returned to Brussels and announced that peace talks had failed and formally handed the matter to NATO for military action. Hours before the announcement, Yugoslavia announced on national television it had declared a state of emergency, citing an imminent threat of war and began a huge mobilisation of troops and resources.\nOn 23 March 1999 at 22:17 UTC, the Secretary General of NATO, Javier Solana, announced he had directed the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), US Army General Wesley Clark, to \"initiate air operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\" On 24 March at 19:00 UTC, NATO started its bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.\nThe NATO bombing campaign lasted from 24 March to 11 June 1999, involving up to 1,000 aircraft operating mainly from bases in Italy and aircraft carriers stationed in the Adriatic. Tomahawk cruise missiles were also extensively used, fired from aircraft, ships, and submarines. With the exception of Greece, all NATO members were involved to some degree. Over the ten weeks of the conflict, NATO aircraft flew over 38,000 combat missions. For the German Air Force (\"Luftwaffe\"), it was the second time it had participated in a conflict since World War II, after the Bosnian War.\nThe proclaimed goal of the NATO operation was summed up by its spokesman as \"Serbs out, peacekeepers in, refugees back\". That is, Yugoslav troops would have to leave Kosovo and be replaced by international peacekeepers to ensure that the Albanian refugees could return to their homes. The campaign was initially designed to destroy Yugoslav air defences and high-value military targets. It did not go very well at first, with bad weather hindering many sorties early on. NATO had seriously underestimated Milo\u0161evi\u0107's will to resist: few in Brussels thought that the campaign would last more than a few days, and although the initial bombardment was not insignificant, it did not match the intensity of the bombing of Baghdad in 1991.\nNATO military operations switched increasingly to attacking Yugoslav units on the ground, hitting targets as small as individual tanks and artillery pieces, as well as continuing with the strategic bombardment. This activity was heavily constrained by politics, as each target needed to be approved by all nineteen member states. Montenegro was bombed on several occasions, but NATO eventually desisted to prop up the precarious position of its anti-Milo\u0161evi\u0107 leader, Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107.\nAt the start of May, a NATO aircraft attacked an Albanian refugee convoy, believing it was a Yugoslav military convoy, killing around fifty people. NATO admitted its mistake five days later, and the Yugoslavs accused NATO of deliberately attacking the refugees. A later report conducted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) opined that \"civilians were not deliberately attacked in this incident\", and that \"neither the aircrew nor their commanders displayed the degree of recklessness in failing to take precautionary measures which would sustain criminal charges.\" On 7 May, NATO bombs hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, killing three Chinese journalists and outraging Chinese public opinion. The United States and NATO later apologised for the bombing, saying that it occurred because of an outdated map provided by the CIA, although this was challenged by a joint report from \"The Observer\" (UK) and \"Politiken\" (Denmark) newspapers, which claimed that NATO intentionally bombed the embassy because it was being used as a relay station for Yugoslav army radio signals. The report by the newspaper contradicts findings in the same report by the ICTY which stated that the root of the failures in target location \"appears to stem from the land navigation techniques employed by an intelligence officer.\" In another incident at the Dubrava prison in Kosovo in May 1999, the Yugoslav government attributed as many as 95 civilian deaths to NATO bombing of the facility after NATO cited Serbian and Yugoslav military activity in the area; a Human Rights Watch report later concluded that at least nineteen ethnic Albanian prisoners had been killed by the bombing, but that an uncertain number \u2013 probably more than 70 \u2013 were killed by Serbian Government forces in the days immediately following the bombing.\nBy the start of April, the conflict appeared little closer to a resolution, and NATO countries began to seriously consider conducting ground operations in Kosovo. British prime minister Tony Blair was a strong advocate of ground forces and pressured the United States to agree; his strong stance caused some alarm in Washington as US forces would be making the largest contribution to any offensive. US President Bill Clinton was extremely reluctant to commit US forces for a ground offensive. Instead, Clinton authorised a CIA operation to look into methods to destabilise the Yugoslav government without training KLA troops. At the same time, Finnish and Russian diplomatic negotiators continued to try to persuade Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to back down. Tony Blair would order 50,000 British soldiers to be made ready for a ground offensive: most of the available British Army.\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107 finally recognised that Russia would not intervene to defend Yugoslavia despite Moscow's strong anti-NATO rhetoric. He thus accepted the conditions offered by a Finnish\u2013Russian mediation team and agreed to a military presence within Kosovo headed by the UN, but incorporating NATO troops.\nThe Norwegian special forces H\u00e6rens Jegerkommando and Forsvarets Spesialkommando cooperated with the KLA in gathering intelligence information. Preparing for an invasion on 12 June, Norwegian special forces worked with the KLA on the Ramno mountain on the border between North Macedonia and Kosovo and acted as scouts to monitor events in Kosovo. Together with British special forces, Norwegian special forces were the first to cross over the border into Kosovo. According to Keith Graves with the television network Sky News, the Norwegians were in Kosovo two days prior to the entry of other forces and were among the first into Pristina. The H\u00e6rens Jegerkommando's and Forsvarets Spesialkommando's job was to clear the way between the contending parties and to make local deals to implement the peace deal between the Serbians and the Kosovo Albanians.\nYugoslav army withdrawal and the entry of KFOR.\nOn 3 June 1999, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 accepted the terms of an international peace plan to end the fighting, with the national parliament adopting the proposal amid contentious debate with delegates coming close to fistfights at some points. On 10 June, the North Atlantic Council ratified the agreement and suspended air operations.\nOn 12 June, after Milo\u0161evi\u0107 accepted the conditions, the NATO-led peacekeeping Kosovo Force (KFOR) of 30,000 soldiers began entering Kosovo. KFOR had been preparing to conduct combat operations, but in the end, its mission was only peacekeeping. The force was based upon the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps headquarters commanded by then Lieutenant General Mike Jackson of the British Army. It consisted of British forces (a brigade built from 4th Armored and 5th Airborne Brigades), a French Army Brigade, a German Army brigade, which entered from the west, while other forces advanced from the south, and Italian Army and United States Army brigades.\nThe first NATO troops to enter Pristina on the 12th of June 1999 were Norwegian special forces from Forsvarets Spesialkommando (FSK) and soldiers from the British Special Air Service 22 Regiment, although to NATO's diplomatic embarrassment Russian troops arrived at the airport first. Norwegian soldiers were the first to come into contact with Russian troops at the airport. FSK's mission was to level the negotiating field between the belligerent parties, and to fine-tune the detailed, local deals needed to implement the peace deal between the Serbians and the Kosovo Albanians.\nThe US contribution, known as the Initial Entry Force, was led by the 1st Armored Division, commanded by Brigadier General Peterson, and was spearheaded by a platoon from the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment attached to the British Forces. Other units included 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) from Stuttgart, Germany and Fort Carson, Colorado, TF 1\u20136 Infantry (1-6 infantry with C Co 1-35AR) from Baumholder, Germany, the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment from Schweinfurt, Germany, and Echo Troop, 4th Cavalry Regiment, also from Schweinfurt, Germany. Also attached to the US force was the Greek Army's 501st Mechanised Infantry Battalion. The initial US forces established their area of operation around the towns of Uro\u0161evac, the future Camp Bondsteel, and Gnjilane, at Camp Monteith, and spent four months\u00a0\u2013 the start of a stay which continues to date\u00a0\u2013 establishing order in the southeast sector of Kosovo.\nDuring the initial incursion, the US soldiers were greeted by Albanians cheering and throwing flowers as US soldiers and KFOR rolled through their villages. Although no resistance was met, three US soldiers from the Initial Entry Force were killed in accidents.\nOn 1 October 1999, approximately 150 paratroopers from Alpha Company, 1/508th Airborne Battalion Combat Team from Vicenza, Italy parachuted into Uro\u0161evac as part of Operation Rapid Guardian. The purpose of the mission was primarily to warn Yugoslav President Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 of NATO resolve and of its rapid military capability. One US soldier, Army Ranger Sgt. Jason Neil Pringle, was killed during operations after his parachute failed to deploy. The paratroopers of the 1/508th then joined paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne and KFOR in patrolling various areas of Kosovo, without incident, through 3 October 1999.\nOn 15 December 1999, Staff Sergeant Joseph Suponcic of 3rd Battalion/10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was killed, when the HMMWV in which he was a passenger struck an anti-tank mine planted by Albanians and meant for the Russian contingent with which SSG Suponcic's team was patrolling in Kosovska Kamenica.\nFollowing the military campaign, the involvement of Russian peacekeepers proved to be tense and challenging to the NATO Kosovo force. The Russians expected to have an independent sector of Kosovo, only to be unhappily surprised with the prospect of operating under NATO command. Without prior communication or coordination with NATO, Russian peacekeeping forces entered Kosovo from Bosnia and Herzegovina and occupied Pristina International Airport ahead of the arrival of NATO forces. This resulted in an incident during which NATO Supreme Commander Wesley Clark's wish to forcibly block the runways with NATO vehicles, to prevent any Russian reinforcement, was refused by KFOR commander General Mike Jackson.\nIn 2010, James Blunt described in an interview how his unit was given the assignment of securing Pristina during the advance of the 30,000-strong peacekeeping force and how the Russian Army had moved in and taken control of the city's airport before his unit's arrival. Blunt shared a part in the difficult task of addressing the potentially violent international incident. According to Blunt's account there was a stand-off with the Russians, and NATO Supreme Commander Clark gave provisional orders to over-power them. Whilst these were questioned by Blunt, they were rejected by General Jackson, with the now famous line, \"I'm not having my soldiers responsible for starting World War III.\"\nIn June 2000, arms trading relations between Russia and Yugoslavia were exposed, which led to retaliation and bombings of Russian checkpoints and area police stations. Outpost Gunner was established on a high point in the Pre\u0161evo Valley by Echo Battery 1/161 Field Artillery in an attempt to monitor and assist with peacekeeping efforts in the Russian Sector. Operating under the support of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443 Field Artillery, 1st Armored Division, the Battery was able to successfully deploy and continuously operate a Firefinder Radar system, which allowed the NATO forces to keep a closer watch on activities in the Sector and the Pre\u0161evo Valley. Eventually a deal was struck whereby Russian forces operated as a unit of KFOR but not under the NATO command structure.\nReaction to the war.\nBecause of the country's restrictive media laws, the Yugoslav media carried little coverage of events in Kosovo, and the attitude of other countries to the humanitarian disaster that was occurring there. Thus, few members of the Yugoslav public expected NATO intervention, instead thinking that a diplomatic agreement would be reached.\nSupport for the war.\nSupport for the Kosovan War and, in particular, the legitimacy of NATO's bombing campaign came from a variety of sources. In a 2009 article, David Clark claimed \"Every member of NATO, every EU country, and most of Yugoslavia's neighbours, supported military action.\" Statements from the leaders of United States, Czech Republic and United Kingdom, respectively, described the war as one \"upholding our values, protecting our interests, and advancing the cause of peace\", \"the first war for values\" and one \"to avert what would otherwise be a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo.\" Others included the then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan who was reported by some sources as acknowledging that the NATO action was legitimate who emphasised that there were times when the use of force was legitimate in the pursuit of peace though Annan stressed that the \"[UN Security] Council should have been involved in any decision to use force.\" The distinction between the legality and legitimacy of the intervention was further highlighted in two separate reports. One was conducted by the Independent International Commission on Kosovo, entitled \"The Kosovo Report\", which found that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Yugoslav] forces were engaged in a well-planned campaign of terror and expulsion of the Kosovar Albanians. This campaign is most frequently described as one of \"ethnic cleansing,\" intended to drive many, if not all, Kosovar Albanians from Kosovo, destroy the foundations of their society, and prevent them from returning.\nIt concluded that \"the NATO military intervention was illegal but legitimate\", The second report was published by the NATO Office of Information and Press which reported that, \"the human rights violations committed on a large scale in Kosovo provide an incontestable ground with reference to the humanitarian aspect of NATO's intervention.\" Some critics note that NATO did not have the backing of the United Nations Security Council meant that its intervention had no legal basis, but according to some legal scholars, \"there are nonetheless certain bases for that action that are not legal, but justified.\"\nAside from politicians and diplomats, commentators and intellectuals also supported the war. Michael Ignatieff called NATOs intervention a \"morally justifiable response to ethnic cleansing and the resulting flood of refugees, and not the cause of the flood of refugees\" while Christopher Hitchens said NATO intervened only, \"when Serbian forces had resorted to mass deportation and full-dress ethnic 'cleansing.'\" Writing in \"The Nation\", Richard A. Falk wrote that, \"the NATO campaign achieved the removal of Yugoslav military forces from Kosovo and, even more significant, the departure of the dreaded Serbian paramilitary units and police\" while an article in \"The Guardian\" wrote that for Mary Kaldor, Kosovo represented a laboratory on her thinking for human security, humanitarian intervention and international peacekeeping, the latter two which she defined as, \"a genuine belief in the equality of all human beings; and this entails a readiness to risk lives of peacekeeping troops to save the lives of others where this is necessary.\" Reports stated there had been no peace between Albanians and Serbs, citing the deaths of 1,500 Albanians and displacement of 270,000 prior to NATO intervention.\nCriticism of the case for war.\nThe NATO intervention has been seen as a political diversionary tactic, coming as it did on the heels of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, pointing to the fact that coverage of the bombing directly replaced coverage of the scandal in US news cycles. Herbert Foerstel points out that before the bombing, rather than there being an unusually bloody conflict, the KLA was not engaged in a widespread war against Yugoslav forces and the death toll among all concerned (including ethnic Albanians) skyrocketed following NATO intervention. In a post-war report released by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the organization also noted \"the pattern of the expulsions and the vast increase in lootings, killings, rape, kidnappings and pillage once the NATO air war began on March 24\".\nNoam Chomsky argues that the bombing was \"not undertaken in \u201cresponse\u201d to ethnic cleansing and to \u201creverse\u201d it, as leaders alleged\", but rather that \"with full awareness of the likely consequences, Clinton and Blair decided in favor of a war that led to a radical escalation of ethnic cleansing along with other deleterious effects.\" Chomsky also notes, similarly to Foerstel, that the number of casualties in the war before the bombing constituted a small number. He concludes that it is impossible to justify the bombing, as there \"could be no reasonable expectation of massive ethnic cleansing and violence\". According to Chomsky, the Ra\u010dak massacre that was considered a turning point for NATO amounted to 45 deaths, a very low number compared to the atrocities committed from both sides after the bombing. According to the International Herald Tribune, \"U.S. intelligence reported ... that the Kosovo rebels intended to draw NATO into its fight for independence by provoking Serbian forces into further atrocities.\"\nU.S. President Clinton, his administration and NATO governments were accused of inflating the number of Kosovo Albanians killed by state forces. During the NATO bombing campaign, the then Secretary of Defense, William Cohen claimed that 100,000 Kosovo Albanian men of military age were missing, possibly murdered. The conservative media watchdog group Accuracy in Media charged the alliance with distorting the situation in Kosovo and lying about the number of civilian deaths in order to justify U.S. involvement in the conflict.\nAfter the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said that the US was using its economic and military superiority to aggressively expand its influence and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Chinese leaders called the NATO campaign a dangerous precedent of naked aggression, a new form of colonialism, and an aggressive war groundless in morality or law. It was seen as part of a plot by the US to destroy Yugoslavia, expand eastward and control all of Europe.\nThe United Nations Charter does not allow military interventions in other sovereign countries with few exceptions which, in general, need to be decided upon by the United Nations Security Council; this legal enjoinment has proved controversial with many legal scholars who argue that though the Kosovo War was illegal, it was still legitimate. The issue was brought before the UN Security Council by Russia, in a draft resolution which, \"inter alia\", would affirm \"that such unilateral use of force constitutes a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter\". China, Namibia, and Russia voted for the resolution, the other members against, thus it failed to pass.\nThe war inflicted many casualties. Already by March 1999, an estimated 1,500\u20132,000 civilians and combatants were dead. However, estimates showed that prior to the bombing campaign on 24 March 1999, approximately 1,800 civilians had been killed in the Kosovo war, mostly Albanians but also Serbs and that there had been no evidence of genocide or ethnic cleansing. By November 1999, 2,108 victims had been exhumed from the province with a total approaching 3,000 expected, but it was unclear how many were civilians and combatants, while the number was also far from the 10,000 minimum civilian death figure cited by Western officials. Final estimates of the casualties are still unavailable for either side.\nPerhaps the most controversial deliberate attack of the war was that made against the headquarters of RTS, Serbian public radio and television, on 23 April 1999, which killed at least fourteen people.\nPrivately, NATO European members were divided about the aims and necessity of the war. Most European allies did not trust the motives of Kosovan Albanians and according to NATO General Wesley Clark, \"There was a sense among some that NATO was fighting on the wrong side\" in a war between Christians and Muslims.\nDemocratic League of Kosovo and FARK.\nThe Democratic League of Kosovo (DLK) led by Ibrahim Rugova had been the leading political entity in Kosovo since its creation in 1989. Its parallel government in exile was led by Bujar Bukoshi, and its Minister of Defence until 1998 was the former Yugoslav colonel Ahmet Krasniqi. DLK politicians opposed the armed conflict and were not ready to accept KLA as a political factor in the region and tried to persuade the population not to support it. At one point Rugova even claimed that it was set up by Serbian intelligence as an excuse to invade, or to discredit DLK itself. Nevertheless, the support for KLA even within DLK membership and specifically in the diaspora grew, together with the dissatisfaction with and antagonism toward DLK. KLA initial personnel were members or former members of the DLK. With the changes of the international stance towards KLA and its recognition as a factor in the conflict, DLK's position also shifted. The Armed Forces of the Republic of Kosovo, known as FARK, were established in order to place DLK as a military factor in addition to a political one. A parallel paramilitary structure such as FARK was not received well by the KLA.\nOn 21 September 1998 Ahmet Krasniqi was shot in Tirana. Those responsible were not found, although several theories emerged. The Democratic Party of Albania and its leader Sali Berisha, strong supporters of DLK and FARK, accused SHIK and the Albanian government, which was supporting the KLA, of being responsible. FARK was never a determining factor in the war and was not involved in any battles. It did not number more than few hundred men, and it did not show any commitment to fighting the Serbs, accepting a broader autonomy as a solution rather than independence. Some of the FARK officers were incorporated later under the KLA umbrella. Besides FARK, DLK would also politically and diplomatically oppose KLA and their methods. In a meeting with US President Clinton on 29 May 1999, Rugova, accompanied by Fehmi Agani, Bukoshi, and Veton Surroi, accused KLA of being a left-wing ideology bearer, and some of its leaders as being \"nostalgic to known communist figures, such as Enver Hoxha\", referring to the People's Movement of Kosovo (LPK) nucleus of KLA, an old underground rival with strong left-wing orientation.\nRugova was present at the negotiations held in Rambouillet and supported the Rambouillet Agreement since the first round, but without any influence. Following the ethnic cleansing of the Albanian population, there was close to a total Albanian support for the NATO campaign, including the DLK side. Surprisingly, Ibrahim Rugova showed up in Belgrade as a guest of Milosevic. At a joint TV appearance on 1 April, ending in a Rugova-Milosevic handshake, Rugova asked for a peaceful solution and the bombings to stop. In the same conference, Millosevic presented his proposal for Kosovo as part of a three-unit federal Yugoslavian state. Rugova's presence in Belgrade scattered another set of accusations from KLA and its supporters. Besides being 'passive' and 'too peaceful', Rugova and DLK were accused as 'traitors'. Following Rugova's passage to Italy on 5 May, Rugova claimed that he had been under duress and any \"agreement\" with Milosovic had no meaning. The general opinion expected the DLK structures and its leader to vanish from the political scene of Kosovo after the Yugoslav withdrawal. Rugova himself stayed out of Kosovo for several weeks, while the prime-minister Bukoshi and other leading membership returned. With only a fraction of Kosovo Albanians participating actively in the war, the support for DLK increased again as a way of opposing the arrogance of many KLA leaders who openly engaged in controlling the economical and political life within the vacuum created right before the deployment of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). In the October 2000 local elections, DLK was confirmed as the leading political party.\nThe feud between KLA and DLK continued in the post-war Kosovo. Many political activists of DLK were assassinated and the perpetrators not found, including Xhemajl Mustafa, Rugova's most trusted aide.\nCasualties.\nCivilian losses.\nIn June 2000, the Red Cross reported that 3,368 civilians (mainly Kosovar Albanians, but with several hundred Serbs, and Roma) were still missing, nearly one year after the conflict, most of whom it concluded had to be 'presumed dead'.\nA study by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia published in 2000 in medical journal the Lancet estimated that \"12,000 deaths in the total population\" could be attributed to war. This number was achieved by surveying 1,197 households from February 1998 through June 1999. 67 out of the 105 deaths reported in the sample population were attributed to war-related trauma, which extrapolates to be 12,000 deaths if the same war-related mortality rate is applied to Kosovo's total population. The highest mortality rates were in men between 15 and 49 (5,421 victims of war) as well as for men over 50 (5,176 victims). For persons younger than 15, the estimates were 160 victims for males and 200 for females. For women between 15 and 49 the estimate is that there were 510 victims; older than 50 years the estimate is 541 victims. The authors stated that it was not \"possible to differentiate completely between civilian and military casualties\".\nIn the 2008 joint study by the Humanitarian Law Centre (an NGO from Serbia and Kosovo), The International Commission on Missing Persons, and the Missing Person Commission of Serbia made a name-by-name list of war and post-war victims. According to the updated 2015 Kosovo Memory Book, 13,535 people were killed or missing due to the Kosovo conflict, from 1 January 1998 up until December 2000. Of these, 10,812 were Albanians, 2,197 Serbs and 526 Roma, Bosniaks, Montenegrins and others. 10,317 civilians were killed or went missing, of whom 8,676 were Albanians, 1,196 Serbs and 445 Roma and others. The remaining 3,218 dead or missing were combatants, including 2,131 members of the KLA and FARK, 1,084 members of Serbian forces and 3 members of KFOR. As of 2019, the book had been updated to a total of 13,548. In August 2017, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that between 1998 and 1999, more than 6,000 people had gone missing in Kosovo, and that 1,658 remained missing, with neither the person nor the body having, at that time, been found.\nCivilians killed by NATO airstrikes.\nYugoslavia claimed that NATO attacks caused between 1,200 and 5,700 civilian casualties. NATO's Secretary General, Lord Robertson, wrote after the war that \"the actual toll in human lives will never be precisely known\" but he then offered the figures found in a report by Human Rights Watch as a reasonable estimate. This report counted between 488 and 527 civilian deaths (90 to 150 of them killed from cluster bomb use) in 90 separate incidents, the worst of which were the 87 Albanian refugees who perished at the hands of NATO bombs, near Kori\u0161a.\nCivilians killed by Yugoslav forces.\nVarious estimates of the number of killings attributed to Yugoslav forces have been announced through the years. An estimated 800,000 Kosovo Albanians fled and an estimated 7,000 to 9,000 were killed, according to \"The New York Times\". The estimate of 10,000 deaths is used by the US Department of State, which cited human rights abuses as its main justification for attacking Yugoslavia.\nStatistical experts working on behalf of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) prosecution estimate that the total number of dead is about 10,000. Eric Fruits, a professor at Portland State University, argued that the experts' analyses were based on fundamentally flawed data and that none of its conclusions are supported by any valid statistical analysis or tests.\nIn August 2000, the ICTY announced that it had exhumed 2,788 bodies in Kosovo, but declined to say how many were thought to be victims of war crimes. KFOR sources told Agence France Presse that of the 2,150 bodies that had been discovered up until July 1999, about 850 were thought to be victims of war crimes.\nIn an attempt to conceal the corpses of the victims, Yugoslav forces transported the bodies of murdered Albanians deep inside Serbia and buried them in mass graves. According to HLC, many of the bodies were taken to the Ma\u010dkatica Aluminium Complex near Surdulica and the Copper Mining And Smelting Complex in Bor, where they were incinerated. There are reports that some bodies of Albanian victims were also burned in the Feronikli plant in Glogovac.\nKnown mass graves:\nCivilians killed by KLA forces.\nThe KLA abducted and killed Serbian, Roma, and moderate Albanian civilians during and after the war. The exact number of civilians killed by the KLA is not known, though estimates conducted in the initial post-war months listed several hundreds with the targeting of non-Albanians intensifying in the immediate aftermath of KFOR deployment. Although more than 2,500 non-Albanians are believed to have been killed in the period between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2000, it is not known how many of them were killed by the KLA or affiliated groups.\nNATO losses.\nMilitary casualties on the NATO side were light. According to official reports, the alliance suffered no fatalities as a direct result of combat operations. In the early hours of 5 May, a US military AH-64 Apache helicopter crashed approximately , according to CNN, or , according to the BBC, northeast of Tirana, Albania's capital, very close to the border between Kosovo and Albania. The two US pilots of the helicopter, Army Chief Warrant Officers David Gibbs and Kevin L. Reichert, died in that crash. According to NATO statements, they were the only NATO fatalities during the war. However, British radio intercepts of Serbian military communications, said that several French foreign intelligence officers had been killed alongside KLA fighters in a Serbian ambush.\nThere were other casualties after the war, mostly due to land mines. During the war, the alliance reported the loss of the first US stealth aeroplane (an F-117 Nighthawk) ever shot down by enemy fire. Furthermore, an F-16 fighter was lost near \u0160abac and 32 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from different nations were lost. The wreckages of downed UAVs were shown on Serbian television during the war. Some US sources claim a second F-117A was also heavily damaged, and although it made it back to its base, it never flew again. A-10 Thunderbolts have been reported as losses, with two shot down and another two damaged. Three US soldiers riding a Humvee in a routine patrol were captured by Yugoslav special forces across the Macedonian border.\nYugoslav military losses.\nAt first, NATO claimed to have killed 10,000 Yugoslav troops, while Yugoslavia claimed only 500 had been killed; the NATO investigative teams later corrected it to a few hundred Yugoslav troops killed by air strikes. In 2001, the Yugoslav authorities claimed 462 soldiers were killed and 299 wounded by NATO airstrikes. Later, in 2013, Serbia claimed that 1,008 Yugoslav soldiers and policemen had been killed by NATO bombing. In early June 1999, NATO claimed that 5,000 Yugoslav servicemen had been killed and 10,000 had been wounded during the NATO air campaign. NATO has since revised this estimate to 1,200 Yugoslav soldiers and policemen killed.\nOf military equipment, NATO destroyed around 50 Yugoslav Air Force aircraft including 6 MiG-29s destroyed in air-to-air combat. A number of G-4 Super Galebs and 4 MiG-29s were destroyed in their hardened aircraft shelter by bunker-busting bombs which started a fire which spread quickly because the shelter doors were not closed. At the end of war, NATO officially claimed that they had destroyed 93 Yugoslav tanks. Yugoslavia admitted a total of 3 destroyed tanks. The latter figure was verified by European inspectors when Yugoslavia rejoined the Dayton accords, by noting the difference between the number of tanks then and at the last inspection in 1995. NATO claimed that the Yugoslav army lost 93 tanks (M-84's and T-55's), 132 APCs, and 52 artillery pieces. \"Newsweek\", the second-largest news weekly magazine in the U.S., gained access to a suppressed US Air Force report that claimed the real numbers were \"3 tanks, not 120; 18 armored personnel carriers, not 220; 20 artillery pieces, not 450\". Another US Air Force report gives a figure of 14 tanks destroyed. Most of the targets hit in Kosovo were decoys, such as tanks made out of plastic sheets with telegraph poles for gun barrels, or old World War II\u2013era tanks which were not functional. Anti-aircraft defences were preserved by the simple expedient of not turning them on, preventing NATO aircraft from detecting them, but forcing them to keep above a ceiling of , making accurate bombing much more difficult. Towards the end of the war, it was claimed that carpet bombing by B-52 aircraft had caused huge casualties among Yugoslav troops stationed along the Kosovo\u2013Albania border. Careful searching by NATO investigators found no evidence of any such large-scale casualties.\nThe most significant loss for the Yugoslav Army was the damaged and destroyed infrastructure. Almost all military air bases and airfields (Batajnica, La\u0111evci, Slatina, Golubovci and \u0110akovica) and other military buildings and facilities were badly damaged or destroyed. Unlike the units and their equipment, military buildings could not be camouflaged. thus, defence industry and military technical overhaul facilities were also seriously damaged (Utva, Zastava Arms factory, Moma Stanojlovi\u0107 air force overhaul centre, technical overhaul centres in \u010ca\u010dak and Kragujevac). In an effort to weaken the Yugoslav Army, NATO targeted several important civilian facilities (the Pan\u010devo oil refinery, Novi Sad oil refinery, bridges, TV antennas, railroads, etc.)\nKLA losses.\nAround 1,500 Kosovo Liberation Army soldiers were killed, according to KLA's own estimates. HLC registered 2,131 KLA and FARK insurgents killed in its comprehensive database.\nAftermath.\nThe Yugoslav and Serb forces caused the displacement of between 1.2\u00a0million to 1.45\u00a0million Kosovo Albanians. After the end of the war in June 1999, numerous Albanian refugees started returning home from neighboring countries. By November 1999, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, 848,100 out of 1,108,913 had returned.\nAccording to the 1991 Yugoslavia Census, of the nearly 2\u00a0million population of Kosovo in 1991, 194,190 were Serbs, 45,745 were Romani and 20,356 were Montenegrins. According to the Human Rights Watch, 200,000 Serbs and thousands of Roma fled from Kosovo during and after the war. Homes of minorities were burned and Orthodox churches and monasteries were destroyed. The Yugoslav Red Cross had also registered 247,391 mostly Serbian refugees by 26 November. More than 164,000 Serbs left Kosovo during the seven weeks which followed Yugoslav and Serb forces' withdrawal from, and the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) entering Kosovo.\nFurther inter-ethnic violence took place in 2000, and 2004.\nWar crimes.\nBy the Federal Yugoslav government.\nFor the government of Serbia, cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is \"still regarded as a distressing obligation, the necessary price for joining the European Union\". Religious objects were damaged or destroyed. Of the 498 mosques in Kosovo that were in active use, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) documented that 225 mosques sustained damage or destruction by the Yugoslav Serb army. In all, eighteen months of the Yugoslav Serb counterinsurgency campaign between 1998 and 1999 within Kosovo resulted in 225 or a third out of a total of 600 mosques being damaged, vandalised, or destroyed. During the war, Islamic architectural heritage posed for Yugoslav Serb paramilitary and military forces as Albanian patrimony, with destruction of non-Serbian architectural heritage being a methodical and planned component of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.\nWidespread rape and sexual violence by the Serbian army, police and paramilitaries occurred during the conflict and the majority of victims were Kosovo Albanian women, numbering an estimated 20,000. The crimes of rape by the Serb military, paramilitary and police amounted to crimes against humanity and a war crime of torture.\nOn 27 April 1999, a mass execution of at least 377 Kosovo Albanian civilians, of whom 36 were under 18 years old, was committed by Serbian police and Yugoslav Army forces in the village of Meja near the town of Gjakova. It followed an operation which began after the killing of six Serbian policemen by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). The victims were pulled from refugee convoys at a checkpoint in Meja and their families were ordered to proceed to Albania. Men and boys were separated and then executed by the road. It was one of the largest massacres in the Kosovo War.\nYugoslav President Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was charged by the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) with crimes against humanity and war crimes. In 2001, then-President Vojislav Ko\u0161tunica \"fought tooth and nail\" against attempts to put Milo\u0161evi\u0107 before an international court but was unable to prevent this happening after further atrocities were revealed.\nBy 2014, the ICTY issued final verdicts against the indicted Yugoslav officials who were found guilty of deportation, other inhumane acts (forcible transfer), murder and persecutions (crimes against humanity, Article 5), as well as murder (violations of the laws or customs of war, Article 3):\nThe ICTY found that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBy Kosovo Albanian forces.\nThe ICTY convicted KLA commander Haradin Bala for murder, torture and cruel treatment in the Lapu\u0161nik prison camp, and sentencted him to 13 years\u2019 imprisonment. Fatmir Limaj and Isak Musliu were acquitted.\nIn 2008, Carla Del Ponte published a book in which she alleged that, after the end of the war in 1999, Kosovo Albanians were smuggling organs of between 100 and 300 Serbs and other minorities from the province to Albania.\nIn March 2005, a UN tribunal indicted Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj for war crimes against the Serbs. On 8 March, he tendered his resignation. Haradinaj, an ethnic Albanian, was a former commander who led units of the Kosovo Liberation Army and was appointed prime minister after winning an election of 72 votes to three in the Kosovo's Parliament in December 2004. Haradinaj was acquitted on all counts along with fellow KLA veterans Idriz Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj. The Office of the Prosecutor appealed their acquittals, resulting in the ICTY ordering a partial retrial. On 29 November 2012 all three were acquitted for the second time on all charges. The trials were rife with accusations of witness intimidation, as media outlets from several different countries wrote that as many as nineteen people who were supposed to be witnesses in the trial against Haradinaj were murdered (the ICTY disputed these reports).\nAccording to Human Rights Watch (HRW), \"800 non-Albanian civilians were kidnapped and murdered from 1998 to 1999\". After the war, \"479 people have gone missing... most of them Serbs\". HRW notes that \"the intent behind many of the killings and abductions that have occurred in the province since June 1999 appears to be the expulsion of Kosovo's Serb and Roma population rather than a desire for revenge alone. In numerous cases, direct and systematic efforts were made to force Serbs and Roma to leave their homes.\" Some 200,000 Serbs and Roma fled Kosovo following the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces.\nIn April 2014, the Assembly of Kosovo considered and approved the establishment of a special court to try cases involving crimes and other serious abuses committed in 1999\u20132000 by members of the KLA. Reports of abuses and war crimes committed by the KLA during and after the conflict include massacres of civilians, prison camps, burning and looting of homes and destruction of medieval churches and monuments.\nCarla Del Ponte said that the US for political reasons, did not want the ICTY to scrutinise war crimes committed by the KLA. According to her, Madeleine Albright who was the Secretary of State at the time told her to proceed slowly with the investigation of Ramush Haradinaj to avoid unrest in Kosovo.\nBy NATO forces.\nThe Yugoslav government and a number of international pressure groups (e.g., Amnesty International) claimed that NATO had carried out war crimes during the conflict, notably the bombing of the Serbian TV headquarters in Belgrade on 23 April 1999, where 16 people were killed and 16 more were injured. Sian Jones of Amnesty stated, \"The bombing of the headquarters of Serbian state radio and television was a deliberate attack on a civilian object and as such constitutes a war crime\". A report conducted by the ICTY entitled \"Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\" concluded that, \"Insofar as the attack actually was aimed at disrupting the communications network, it was legally acceptable\" and that, \"NATO's targeting of the RTS building for propaganda purposes was an incidental (albeit complementary) aim of its primary goal of disabling the Serbian military command and control system and to destroy the nerve system and apparatus that keeps Milosevi\u0107 in power.\" In regards to civilian casualties, it further stated that though they were, \"unfortunately high, they do not appear to be clearly disproportionate.\"\nMilitary and political consequences.\nThe Kosovo War had a number of important consequences in terms of the military and political outcome. The status of Kosovo remains unresolved; international negotiations began in 2006 to determine Kosovo's level of autonomy as envisaged under UN Security Council Resolution 1244, but efforts failed. The province is administered by the United Nations despite its unilateral declaration of independence on 17 February 2008.\nThe UN-backed talks, led by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari, had begun in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself. In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes \"supervised independence\" for the province, which is in contrary to UN Security Council Resolution 1244. By July 2007, the draft resolution, which was backed by the United States, United Kingdom, and other European members of the Security Council, had been rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty. Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, stated that it would not support any resolution which is not acceptable to both Belgrade and Pri\u0161tina.\nThe campaign exposed significant weaknesses in the US arsenal, which were later addressed for the Afghanistan and Iraq campaigns. Apache attack helicopters and AC-130 Spectre gunships were brought up to the front lines but were never used after two Apaches crashed during training in the Albanian mountains. Stocks of many precision missiles were reduced to critically low levels. For combat aircraft, continuous operations resulted in skipped maintenance schedules, and many aircraft were withdrawn from service awaiting spare parts and service. Also, many of the precision-guided weapons proved unable to cope with Balkan weather, as the clouds blocked the laser guidance beams. This was resolved by retrofitting bombs with Global Positioning System satellite guidance devices that are immune to bad weather. Although pilotless surveillance aircraft were extensively used, often attack aircraft could not be brought to the scene quickly enough to hit targets of opportunity. This led missiles being fitted to Predator drones in Afghanistan, reducing the \"sensor to shooter\" time to virtually zero.\nKosovo also showed that some low-tech tactics could reduce the impact of a high-tech force such as NATO; the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 government cooperated with Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist regime in Iraq, passing on many of the lessons learned in the Gulf War. The Yugoslav army had long expected to need to resist a much stronger enemy, either Soviet or NATO, during the Cold War and had developed tactics of deception and concealment in response. These would have been unlikely to have resisted a full-scale invasion for long, but were probably used to mislead overflying aircraft and satellites. Among the tactics used were:\nMilitary decorations.\nAs a result of the Kosovo War, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization created a second NATO medal, the NATO Medal for Kosovo Service, an international military decoration. Shortly thereafter, NATO created the Non-Article 5 Medal for Balkans service to combine both Yugoslavian and Kosovo operations into one service medal.\nDue to the involvement of the United States armed forces, a separate US military decoration, known as the Kosovo Campaign Medal, was established by President Bill Clinton in 2000.\nThe Kosovo Campaign Medal (KCM) is a military award of the United States Armed Forces established by Executive Order 13154 of President Bill Clinton on 3 May 2000. The medal recognises military service performed in Kosovo from 24 March 1999 through 31 December 2013.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is bordered by Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north, the Strait of Dover to the south-east, East Sussex to the south-west, Surrey to the west, and Greater London to the north-west. \nThe county has an area of and had population of 1,931,684 in 2024. The north-west of Kent is densely populated, with Dartford and Gravesend belonging to the Greater London conurbation and Chatham, Gillingham and Rochester forming a second conurbation around the River Medway; the town of Maidstone is located to their south. The remainder of the county is more rural, and its principal settlements include the city of Canterbury in the north-east, the seaside resort of Margate on the north-east coast, and the ports of Dover and Folkestone on the east coast. For local government purposes Kent consists of a non-metropolitan county, with twelve districts, and the unitary authority area of Medway. The county historically included south-east Greater London, and is one of the home counties.\nThe north of Kent is a plain bordering the Thames Estuary. South of this is the North Downs, a chalk downland ridge which crosses the county from north-west to south-east and which forms dramatic chalk cliffs, including the White Cliffs of Dover, where it meets the English Channel. The south-west of the county contains part of the Greensand Ridge and the Weald, the area between the North and South Downs. The south-east of the county contains the low-lying Romney Marsh. The North Downs and High Weald have been designated national landscapes. The geography of the county lends itself to the cultivation of fruit orchards, and it has been nicknamed \"the Garden of England\". In north-west Kent, industries include aggregate building material extraction, printing, and scientific research. Coal mining has also played its part in the county's industrial heritage.\nKent's location between London and the Strait of Dover, the narrowest crossing point between England and mainland Europe, has led to the county being the point of entry for many prominent figures and groups in British history. It was one of the first British territories to be settled by Germanic tribes, most notably the Jutes, following the withdrawal of the Romans. In the 6th century, Saint Augustine landed in the county to begin the conversion of England to Christianity and became the first archbishop of Canterbury; Canterbury Cathedral is now a World Heritage Site. England relied on the county's ports to provide warships through much of its history; the Cinque Ports in the 10th\u201314th centuries and Chatham Dockyard in the 16th\u201320th centuries were of particular importance. Dover Castle has been described as the \"key of England\" due to its strategic significance.\nEtymology.\nThe name is of Celtic origin and is one of the oldest place names of the British Isles still in use today, being first recorded in a periplus in ancient Greek of the c.\u2009320s B.C. by Pytheas. The original work, which does not survive, is quoted explicitly by Strabo (\"Geog.\" 1.4.3) and implicitly by Diodorus (\"BH\" 5.21).\n\u1f41 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03cc\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f22 \u03b4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78 \u03bc\u1fc6\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f78 \u039a\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f21\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u039a\u03b5\u03bb\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c6\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\nTranslation:\nYet he [Pytheas] declares that the extent of the island is more\u00a0than 20,000 stadia and says that Kantion is several days' sail from Keltike.\nAs such, it has been claimed as the \"oldest recorded name still in use in England\".\nThe meaning has been explained as 'coastal district', 'corner-land' or 'land on the edge' ( 'bordering of a circle, tyre, edge'; 'circle'; 'side, edge'). In Latin sources the area is called or , while the Anglo-Saxons referred to it as , or .\nHistory.\nThe area was first occupied by early humans, intermittently due to periods of extreme cold, during the Palaeolithic (Old Stone Age), as attested by an early Neanderthal skull found in the quarries at Swanscombe. The Medway megaliths were built during the Neolithic era. There is a rich sequence of Bronze Age, Celtic Iron Age, and Britto-Roman era occupation, as indicated by finds and features such as the Ringlemere gold cup and the Roman villas of the Darent valley.\nJulius Caesar described the area as , or the home of the Cantiaci, in 51\u00a0BC. The extreme west of the modern county was by the time of Roman Britain occupied by a Celtic Iron Age tribe known as the Regni. Caesar wrote that the people of Kent were \"by far the most civilised inhabitants of Britain\".\nFollowing the withdrawal of the Romans, large numbers of Germanic speakers from mainland Europe settled in Kent, bringing their language, which came to be Old English. While they expelled the native Romano-British population, some likely remained in the area, eventually assimilating with the newcomers. Of the invading tribes, the Jutes were the most prominent, and the area became a Jutish kingdom recorded as \"Cantia\" in about 730 and \"Cent\" in 835. The early medieval inhabitants of the county were referred to as the \"Cantwara\", or Kentish people. The city of Canterbury was the largest in Kent.\nIn 597, Pope Gregory I appointed the religious missionary (who became Saint Augustine of Canterbury after his death) as the first Archbishop of Canterbury. In the previous year, Augustine successfully converted the pagan King \u00c6thelberht of Kent to Christianity. The Diocese of Canterbury became England's first Episcopal See with first cathedral and has since remained England's centre of Christianity. The second designated English cathedral was for West Kent at Rochester Cathedral.\nKent was traditionally partitioned into East and West Kent, and into lathes and hundreds. The traditional border of East and West Kent was the county's main river, the Medway. Men and women from east of the Medway are Men (or Maids) of Kent, those from the west are Kentishmen or Kentish Maids. The divide has been explained by some as originating in the Anglo-Saxon migrations, with Jutes mainly settling east of the Medway and Saxons settling west of it.\nIn the 11th century, the people of Kent (or \"Chenth\", per the Domesday Book) adopted the motto \"Invicta\", meaning \"undefeated\" or \"unconquered\". The adoption of this motto followed the invasion of Britain by William of Normandy, as he was unable to subdue the county and they negotiated favourable terms. The continued resistance of the Kentish people against the Normans led to Kent's designation as a semi-autonomous county palatine in 1067. Under the nominal rule of William's half-brother Odo of Bayeux, the county was granted similar powers to those granted in the areas bordering Wales and Scotland.\nDuring the medieval and early modern period, Kent played a major role in several of England's most notable rebellions, including the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, led by Wat Tyler,\nJack Cade's Kent rebellion of 1450, and Wyatt's Rebellion of 1554 against Queen Mary I.\nThe Royal Navy first used the River Medway in 1547. By the reign of Elizabeth I (1558\u20131603) a small dockyard had been established at Chatham. By 1618, storehouses, a ropewalk, a drydock, and houses for officials had been built downstream from Chatham.\nBy the 17th century, tensions between Britain and the powers of the Netherlands and France led to increasing military build-up in the county. Forts were built all along the coast following the raid on the Medway, a successful attack by the Dutch navy on the shipyards of the Medway towns in 1667.\nThe 18th century was dominated by wars with France, during which the Medway became the primary base for a fleet that could act along the Dutch and French coasts. When the theatre of operation moved to the Atlantic, this role was assumed by Portsmouth and Plymouth, with Chatham concentrating on shipbuilding and ship repair. As an indication of the area's military importance, the first Ordnance Survey map ever drawn was a one-inch map of Kent, published in 1801. Many of the Georgian naval buildings still stand.\nIn the early 19th century, smugglers were very active on the Kent coastline. Gangs such as The Aldington Gang brought spirits, tobacco and salt to the county, and transported goods such as wool across the sea to France.\nIn 1889, the County of London was created and took over responsibility for local administration of parts of north-west Kent. These included the towns of Greenwich, Woolwich, Plumstead, Deptford, Lee, Eltham, Charlton, and Kidbrooke. In 1900, however, Kent absorbed the district of Penge. Some of Kent is contiguous with the Greater London sprawl, notably parts of Dartford.\nOriginally, the border between Kent and Sussex (later East Sussex) ran through the towns of Tunbridge Wells and Lamberhurst. In 1894, by the Local Government Act, the parts of these towns that lay in East Sussex were absorbed by Kent.\nDuring the Second World War, much of the Battle of Britain was fought in the skies over Kent.\nBetween June 1944 and March 1945, more than 10,000 V1 flying bombs, or \"Doodlebugs\", were fired towards London from bases in Northern France. Although many were destroyed by aircraft, anti-aircraft guns and barrage balloons, both London and Kent were hit by around 2,500 of these bombs.\nAfter the war, Kent's borders changed several more times. In 1965, the London boroughs of Bromley and Bexley were created from nine towns formerly in Kent. In 1998, Rochester, Strood, Chatham, Gillingham and Rainham left the administrative county of Kent to form the unitary authority of Medway. Plans for another unitary authority in north-west Kent were dropped, but in 2016 consultations began between five Kent local authorities (Canterbury, Thanet, Dover, Folkestone &amp; Hythe, and Ashford) with a view to forming a new unified authority for East Kent, although remaining within the auspices of Kent County Council. This idea was eventually dropped.\nFor almost nine centuries, a small part of present-day East London (the North Woolwich, London E16 area), formed part of Kent.\nGeography.\nKent is in the southeastern corner of England. It borders the Thames Estuary and the North Sea to the north, and the Straits of Dover and the English Channel to the south. France is across the Strait.\nThe major geographical features of the county are based on a series of ridges and valleys running east\u2013west across the county. These are the results of erosion of the Wealden dome, a dome across Kent and Sussex created by alpine movements 20\u201310\u00a0million years ago. This dome consists of an upper layer of chalk above successive layers of Upper Greensand, Gault Clay, Lower Greensand, Weald Clay, and Wealden sandstone. The ridges and valleys formed when the exposed clay eroded faster than the exposed chalk, greensand, or sandstone.\nSevenoaks, Maidstone, Ashford, and Folkestone are built on greensand, while Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells are built on sandstone. Dartford, Gravesend, the Medway towns, Sittingbourne, Faversham, Canterbury, Deal, and Dover are built on chalk. The easterly section of the Wealden dome has been eroded away by the sea, and cliffs such as the White Cliffs of Dover are present where a chalk ridge known as the North Downs meets the coast. Spanning Dover and Westerham is the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\nThe Wealden dome is a Mesozoic structure lying on a Palaeozoic foundation, which can often create the right conditions for coal formation. This is found in East Kent roughly between Deal, Canterbury, and Dover. The Coal Measures within the Westphalian Sandstone are about deep, and are subject to flooding. They occur in two major troughs, which extend under the English Channel.\nSeismic activity has occasionally been recorded in Kent, though the epicentres were offshore. In 1382 and 1580 there were two earthquakes exceeding 6.0 on the Richter Scale. In 1776, 1950, and on 28 April 2007 there were earthquakes of around 4.3. The 2007 earthquake caused physical damage in Folkestone. A further quake on 22 May 2015 measured 4.2 on the Richter Scale. It was centred in the Sandwich area of east Kent at about ten miles below the surface. There was little if any damage reported.\nThe coastline of Kent is continuously changing, due to tectonic uplift and coastal erosion. Until about 960, the Isle of Thanet was an island, separated by the Wantsum channel, formed around a deposit of chalk; over time, the channels silted up with alluvium. Similarly Romney Marsh and Dungeness have been formed by accumulation of alluvium.\nKent's principal river, the River Medway, rises near East Grinstead in Sussex and flows eastwards to Maidstone. Here it turns north and breaks through the North Downs at Rochester, then joins the estuary of the River Thames near Sheerness. The Medway is some long. The river is tidal as far as Allington lock, but in earlier times, cargo-carrying vessels reached as far upstream as Tonbridge. The Medway has captured the head waters of other rivers such as the River Darent. Other rivers of Kent include the River Stour in the east.\nA 2014 study found that Kent shares significant reserves of shale oil with other neighbouring counties, totalling 4.4\u00a0billion barrels of oil, which then Business and Energy Minister Michael Fallon said \"will bring jobs and business opportunities\" and significantly help with UK energy self-sufficiency. Fracking in the area is required to achieve these objectives; it has been opposed by environmental groups.\nClimate.\nKent is one of the warmest parts of Britain. On 10 August 2003, in the hamlet of Brogdale near Faversham the temperature reached , at that time the highest temperature ever officially recorded in the United Kingdom. The record still stands as the hottest August day ever recorded.\nGovernance.\nKent County Council and its twelve district councils administer most of the county (3352\u00a0km2), whilst the Medway Council administers the more densely populated Medway unitary authority (192\u00a0km2), independently of the county council. Together they have around 300 town and parish councils. Kent County Council's headquarters are in Maidstone, while Medway's offices are at Gun Wharf, Chatham.\nFor most of its history since the local government reforms instituted by the Local Government Act 1972, Kent County Council has used to be under Conservative Party control until the latest election. At the most recent county council election in 2025, the Reform UK won the election with 57 seats. Also elected were twelve Liberal Democrats, five from the Conservatives, five from the Green Party and two from the Labour Party.\nOf Kent's thirteen districts, two are under Conservative control (Sevenoaks, Dartford), four are under Labour control (Gravesham, Medway, Thanet, Dover), one is under Liberal Democrat control (Tunbridge Wells), and six are under no overall control and are administered by coalitions (Tonbridge and Malling, Maidstone, Swale, Ashford, Canterbury, Folkestone and Hythe). Notably, Thanet is the only council in the United Kingdom to have come under UK Independence Party (UKIP) control, which it did in 2015.\nAt the national level, Kent is represented in the House of Commons by eighteen Members of Parliament (MPs). The county has historically been dominated by the Conservative Party at general elections. Prior to 2024, the party had won a majority of Kentish seats in every election since the local government reforms of 1974, including during Labour's landslide victories of 1997 and 2001. In both 2010 and 2015, the Conservatives won every seat in the county. The 2024 election saw a sharp decline in support for the Conservatives, and the county is currently represented by eleven Labour MPs, six Conservatives and one Liberal Democrat.\nDemography.\nAt the 2011 census, Kent, including Medway, had 1,727,665 residents (18.0% of which in Medway); had 711,847 households (17.5% of which in Medway) and had 743,436 dwellings (14.8% of which in Medway). 51.1% of Kent's population excluding Medway was female \u2014 as to Medway, this proportion was 50.4%.\nThe tables below provide statistics for the administrative county of Kent, that is, excluding Medway.\nEconomy.\nAt the 2001 UK census[], employment statistics for the residents in Kent, including Medway, were as follows: 41.1% in full-time employment, 12.4% in part-time employment, 9.1% self-employed, 2.9% unemployed, 2.3% students with jobs, 3.7% students without jobs, 12.3% retired, 7.3% looking after home or family, 4.3% permanently sick or disabled, and 2.7% economically inactive for other reasons. Of residents aged 16\u201374, 16% had a higher education qualification or the equivalent, compared to 20% nationwide.\nThe average hours worked per week by residents of Kent were 43.1 for males and 30.9 for females. Their industry of employment was 17.3% retail, 12.4% manufacturing, 11.8% real estate, 10.3% health and social work, 8.9% construction, 8.2% transport and communications, 7.9% education, 6.0% public administration and defence, 5.6% finance, 4.8% other community and personal service activities, 4.1% hotels and restaurants, 1.6% agriculture, 0.8% energy and water supply, 0.2% mining, and 0.1% private households. This is higher than the whole of England for construction and transport/communications and lower for manufacturing.\nKent is sometimes known as the \"Garden of England\" for its abundance of orchards and hop gardens. In particular the county produces tree-grown fruits, strawberries and hazelnuts. Distinctive hop-drying buildings called oasts are common in the countryside, although many have been converted into dwellings. Nearer to London, market gardens also flourish. Kent is the main area for hazelnut production in the UK.\nHowever, in recent years, there has been a significant drop in agriculture, and industry and services are increasing their utilisation of the area. This is illustrated by the following table of economic indicator gross value added (GVA) between 1995 and 2003[] (figures are in \u00a3 millions):\nNorth Kent is heavily industrialised, with cement-making at Northfleet and Cuxton, brickmaking at Sittingbourne, shipbuilding on the Medway and Swale, engineering and aircraft design and construction at Rochester, chemicals at Dartford, papermaking at Swanley, and oil refining at Grain. There is a steel mini mill in Sheerness and a rolling mill in Queenborough. There are two nuclear power stations at Dungeness, although the older one, Dungeness A, built in 1965, was decommissioned in 2006.\nCement-making, papermaking, and coal-mining were important industries in Kent during the 19th and 20th centuries. Cement came to the fore in the 19th century when massive building projects were undertaken. The ready supply of chalk and huge pits between Stone and Gravesend bear testament to that industry. There were also other workings around Burham on the tidal Medway. Chalk, gravel and clay were excavated on Dartford Heath for centuries.\nKent's original paper mills stood on streams like the River Darent, tributaries of the River Medway, and on the River Stour. Two 18th century mills were on the River Len and at Tovil on the River Loose. In the late 19th century huge modern mills were built at Dartford and Northfleet on the River Thames and at Kemsley on The Swale. In pre-industrial times, almost every village and town had its own windmill or watermill, with over 400 windmills known to have stood at some time. Twenty-eight survive within the county today, plus two replica mills and a further two in that part of Kent now absorbed into London. All the major rivers in the county were used to power watermills.\nFrom about 1900, several coal pits operated in East Kent. The Kent Coalfield was mined during the 20th century at several collieries, including Chislet, Tilmanstone, Betteshanger, and the Snowdown Colliery, which ran from 1908 to 1986.\nThe west of the county (including Tunbridge Wells, Tonbridge, and Sevenoaks) has less than 50% of the average claimant count for low incomes or worklessness as the coastal districts of Dover, Folkestone and Hythe, and Thanet (chiefly three resorts: Ramsgate, Broadstairs, and Margate). West and Central Kent have long had many City of London commuters.\nCulture.\nArchitecture.\nKent's geographical location between the Straits of Dover and London has influenced its architecture, as has its Cretaceous geology and its good farming land and fine building clays. Kent's countryside pattern was determined by a gavelkind inheritance system that generated a proliferation of small settlements. There was no open-field system, and the large tracts were owned by the two great abbeys, Christ Church, Canterbury and St Augustine's Abbey, that did not pass into the hands of the king during the Reformation. Canterbury Cathedral is the United Kingdom's metropolitan cathedral; it was founded in AD 598 and displays architecture from all periods. There are nine Anglo-Saxon churches in Kent. Rochester Cathedral is England's second-oldest cathedral, the present building built in the Early English Style.\nThe sites of Richborough Castle and Dover Castle, along with two strategic sites along Watling Street, were fortified by the Romans and the Dukes of Kent. Other important sites include Canterbury city walls and Rochester Castle. Deal Castle, Walmer Castle, Sandown Castle (whose remains were eroded by the sea in the 1990s) were constructed in late mediaeval times, and HM Dockyard, at Chatham and its surrounding castles and forts\u2014Upnor Castle, Great Lines, and Fort Amherst since then.\nKent has three unique vernacular architecture forms: the oast house, the Wealden hall house, and Kentish peg-tiles.\nKent has bridge trusts to maintain its bridges. The great bridge (1387) at Rochester was replaced. There are medieval structures at Aylesford, Yalding and Teston. With the motorways in the late twentieth century came the M2 motorway bridge spanning the Medway and the Dartford tunnel and the Dartford Bridge spanning the Thames.\nLiterature and publishing.\nKent has provided inspiration for several notable writers and artists. It has been suggested that Kent inspired many settings in Shakespeare's plays, and he described it in the line 'Sweet is the country, and is full of riches / The people liberal, active, valiant, worthy.' Canterbury's religious role gave rise to Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\", a key development in the English language. The father of novelist Charles Dickens worked at the Chatham Dockyard; in many of his books, the celebrated novelist featured the scenery of Chatham, Rochester, and the Cliffe marshes. During the late 1930s, Nobel Prize-awarded novelist William Golding worked as a teacher at Maidstone Grammar School, where he met his future wife Ann Brookfield. William Caxton, who first introduced the printing press to England, was born in Kent; the recent invention was key in helping many Kent dialect words and spellings to become standard in English. Lord Northbourne hosted a biodynamic agriculture conference on his estate at Betteshanger in the summer of 1939, he coined the term 'organic farming' and published his manifesto of organic agriculture the following year spawning a global movement for sustainable agriculture and food.\nClassical music.\nMany notable musicians have been associated with Kent. Walter Galpin Alcock, composer and organist, who played the organ at the coronations of Edward VII, George V and George VI, was born at Edenbridge in 1861. Richard Rodney Bennett, composer and pianist, was born at Broadstairs in 1936. Alfred Deller, counter-tenor singer, was born at Margate in 1912. Orlando Gibbons, composer and organist, died in Canterbury on 5 June 1625 and is buried in the cathedral. George Frideric Handel took the waters at Royal Tunbridge Wells in 1734 and 1735. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, together with his father, mother and sister, stayed at Bourne Park House near Canterbury, 25\u201330 July 1765. The nights of 24 and 30 July were spent in Canterbury, where they also went to the horse races. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, then an 18-year-old sea cadet, was anchored at Gravesend from November 1862 to February 1863; while there, he completed the slow movement of his First Symphony. Malcolm Sargent, conductor, was born at Ashford in 1895. Thomas Tallis, composer and organist, was a lay clerk of Canterbury Cathedral around 1541\u20132. Peter Warlock, composer and writer on music, and Ernest John Moeran, composer, resided at Eynsford from 1925 to 1928; Arnold Bax, William Walton and Constant Lambert visited them here. Percy Whitlock, organist and composer, was born at Chatham in 1903.\nVisual arts.\nA number of significant artists came from Kent, including Thomas Sidney Cooper, a painter of landscapes, often incorporating farm animals, Richard Dadd, a maker of faery paintings, and Mary Tourtel, the creator of the children's book character, Rupert Bear. The artist Clive Head was also born in Kent. The landscape painter J. M. W. Turner spent part of his childhood in the town of Margate in East Kent, and regularly returned to visit it throughout his life. The East Kent coast inspired many of his works, including some of his most famous seascapes. Kent has also been the home to artists including Frank Auerbach, Tracey Emin and Stass Paraskos.\nKent was also the location of the largest number of art schools in the country during the nineteenth century, estimated by the art historian David Haste, to approach two hundred. This is believed to be the result of Kent being a front line county during the Napoleonic Wars. At this time, before the invention of photography, draughtsmen were used to draw maps and topographical representations of the fields of battle, and after the wars ended many of these settled permanently in the county in which they had been based. Once the idea of art schools had been established, even in small towns in Kent, the tradition continued, although most of the schools were very small one-man operations, each teaching a small number of daughters of the upper classes how to draw and make watercolour paintings. Nonetheless, some of these small art schools developed into much larger organisations, including Canterbury College of Art, founded by Thomas Sidney Cooper in 1868, which is today the University for the Creative Arts.\nBlean near Canterbury was home to Smallfilms, the production company founded by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin and responsible for children's TV favourites Noggin the Nog, Ivor the Engine and Bagpuss.\nPerforming arts.\nThe county's largest theatre is the Marlowe Theatre in the centre of Canterbury.\nMusic festivals that take place in Kent include Chilled in a Field Festival, Electric Gardens, Hop Farm Festival, In the Woods Festival, Lounge On The Farm and the annual Smugglers Festival near Deal. Other venues for live music include Leas Cliff Hall in Folkestone and the Assembly Hall in Tunbridge Wells.\nTransport.\nRoads.\nWith the Roman invasion, a road network was constructed to connect London to the Channel ports of Dover, Lympne and Richborough. The London\u2013Dover road was Watling Street. These roads are now approximately the A2, B2068, A257, and the A28. The A2 runs through Dartford (A207), Gravesend, Rochester, Canterbury, and Dover; the A20 through Eltham, Wrotham, Maidstone, Charing, Ashford. Hythe, Folkestone and Dover; the A21 around Sevenoaks, Tonbridge, Tunbridge Wells and on to Hastings in East Sussex.\nIn the 1960s, two motorways were built; the M2 from Medway to Faversham, and the M20 from Swanley to Folkestone. Part of the M25 runs through Kent, from Westerham to the Dartford Crossing. The M26 motorway, built in 1980, provides a short link between the M25 at Sevenoaks and the M20 near Wrotham. Kent currently has more motorways by distance than any other county in the UK, with sections of the M2, M20, M25 and M26 totalling 173 km (107 mi) within the extents of the ceremonial county. \nIn the run-up to Britain leaving the European Union, Government minister Michael Gove confirmed that the Government intended to impose a \"de facto\" border between Kent and the rest of England for freight lorries, in order to deal with expected lorry queues of 7,000 or more at Folkestone, Dover and other ports. Heavy goods vehicle operators need to apply for a 24-hour Kent Access Permit (KAP) to take a vehicle of 7.5 tonnes or more into Kent if their intention is to cross to the EU via Dover or the Eurotunnel.\nWater.\nThe medieval Cinque Ports, except for the Port of Dover, have all now silted up. The Medway Estuary has been an important port and naval base for 500 years. The River Medway is tidal up to Allington and navigable up to Tonbridge. Kent's two canals are the Royal Military Canal between Hythe and Rye, which still exists, and the Thames and Medway Canal between Strood and Gravesend. Built-in 1824, it was purchased in 1846 by the railways, which partially backfilled it. Container ports are at Ramsgate and Thamesport. Following the closures across the lower Medway, and the Swale to the Isle of Sheppey, during the 20th century, the Woolwich Ferry is the only domestic ferry that runs in the broadest definition of the county.\nRailways.\nThe earliest locomotive-driven passenger-carrying railway in Britain was the Canterbury &amp; Whitstable Railway which opened in 1830. This and the London &amp; Greenwich Railway later merged into South Eastern Railway (SER).\nBy the 1850s, SER's networks had expanded to Ashford, Ramsgate, Canterbury, Tunbridge Wells, and the Medway towns. SER's major London termini were London Bridge, Charing Cross, and Cannon Street. Kent also had a second major railway, the London, Chatham &amp; Dover Railway. Originally the East Kent Railway in 1858, it linked the northeast Kent coast with London terminals at Victoria and Blackfriars.\nThe two companies merged in 1899, forming the South Eastern &amp; Chatham Railway, further amalgamated with other railways by the Railways Act 1921 to form the Southern Railway. Britain's railways were nationalised in 1948, forming British Railways. The railways were privatised in 1996 and most Kent passenger services were franchised to Connex South Eastern. Following financial difficulties, Connex lost the franchise and was replaced by South Eastern Trains and after Southeastern.\nThe Channel Tunnel was completed in 1994 and High Speed 1 in November 2007 with a London terminus at St Pancras. A new station, Ebbsfleet International, opened between Dartford and Gravesend, serving northern Kent. The high speed lines will be utilised to provide a faster train service to coastal towns like Ramsgate and Folkestone. This station is in addition to the existing station at Ashford International, which has suffered a massive cut in service as a result.\nIn addition to the \"main line\" railways, there are several light, heritage, and industrial railways in Kent. There are three heritage, standard gauge railways; Spa Valley Railway near Tunbridge Wells on the old Tunbridge Wells West branch, East Kent Railway on the old East Kent coalfield area and the Kent &amp; East Sussex Railway on the Weald around Tenterden. In addition, there is the gauge, Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Railway on the southeast Kent coast along the Dungeness peninsula. Finally, there is the , industrial Sittingbourne &amp; Kemsley Light Railway, previously the Bowaters Paper Railway.\nAir.\nCharter flights are provided by Lydd Airport at Lydd.\nIn 2002, it was revealed that the government was considering building a new four-runway airport on the marshland near the village of Cliffe on Hoo Peninsula. This plan was dropped in 2003 following protests by cultural and environmental groups. However further plans for a Thames Estuary Airport on the Kent coast have subsequently emerged, including the Thames Hub Airport, again sited on the Isle of Grain and designed by Lord Foster, and the London Britannia Airport plan, colloquially known as \"Boris Island\" due to its being championed by the former Mayor of London Boris Johnson, which would see a six runway airport built on an artificial island to be towards the Shivering Sands area, north-east of Whitstable.\nBoth of these options were dropped in 2014 in favour of expansion at either Gatwick or Heathrow Airport, the latter finally being the chosen option following Theresa May's installation as Prime Minister in summer 2016.\nManston Airport, located near the village of Manston in the Thanet district, was a former RAF facility that also handled some civilian flights. It closed in 2014.\nEducation.\nKent has four universities: Canterbury Christ Church University with campuses throughout East Kent; University of Kent, with campuses in Canterbury and Medway; University of Greenwich (a London University), with sites at Woolwich, Eltham, London and Medway; the University for the Creative Arts (UCA) also has three of its five campuses in the county.\nAlthough much of Britain adopted a comprehensive education system in the 1970s, Kent County Council (KCC) and Medway Unitary Authority are among around fifteen\nlocal authorities still providing wholly selective education through the eleven-plus examination with students allocated a place at a secondary modern school or at a grammar school.\nTogether, the two Kent authorities have 38 of the 164 grammar schools remaining in Britain.\nKent County Council has the largest education department of any local council in Britain,\nproviding school places for over 289,000 pupils.\nIn 2005\u201306, Kent County Council and Medway introduced a standardised school year, based on six terms, as recommended by the Local Government Association in its 2000 report, \"The Rhythms of Schooling\".\nKent County Council Local Education Authority maintains 96 secondary schools, of which 33 are selective schools and 63 are secondary modern schools.\nMusic education is provided by Kent Music (formerly Kent Music School), which has its origins in the 1940s. Kent Music provides services across the county including Kent County Youth Orchestra, Kent Youth Choirs, and an annual summer school at Benenden School.\nNational Challenge schools.\nIn 2010, Kent had the highest number of National Challenge schools in England: schools which are branded 'failing' based on the British Government's floor targets that 30% of pupils achieve at least 5 GCSE grades A* to C. Of the 63 secondary modern schools, 33 missed this target; thus 52% of Kent secondary modern schools (34% out of all 96 maintained secondary schools) are 'failing'.\nSport.\nIn association football, Kent's highest ranked football team is Gillingham FC (nicknamed 'The Gills') who play in Football League Two, having been demoted at the end of the 2021\u201322 season. Maidstone United was a Football League side from 1989 until going bankrupt in 1992. Kent clubs in the higher levels of non-league football include Ebbsfleet United, who were promoted in 2023. Tonbridge Angels and the current incarnation of Maidstone United currently play in National League South, the sixth tier of the English football pyramid.\nKent is represented in cricket by Kent County Cricket Club. The club was a founder member of the County Championship in 1890 and has won the competition, the major domestic first-class cricket competition, seven times. The club is based at the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury and also plays matches at the Nevill Ground in Royal Tunbridge Wells and the County Cricket Ground, Beckenham. The Kent Women cricket team has won the Women's County Championship seven times since it was established in 1997. Cricket has traditionally been a popular sport in the county and Kent is considered one of the locations in which the game first developed. Teams have represented the county since the early 18th century. The Kent Cricket League is the top level of club competition within Kent and features teams from throughout the county, including areas such as Beckenham and Bexley which were formerly part of the county.\nCanterbury Hockey Club and Holcombe Hockey Club have historically competed at the highest levels of English field hockey, with Holcombe's men's and women's first teams currently playing in the England Hockey Premier Divisions. Sevenoaks Hockey Club's women's first XI competes in Division 1 South, the second tier of the national league structure.\nThe Invicta Dynamos, based in Gillingham, are a semi-professional ice hockey team that plays in the National Ice Hockey League. They replaced the Medway Bears as the senior team in 1997. They share the home ice rink at Planet Ice Gillingham with the secondary senior team, Invicta Mustangss, and the ladies' ice hockey team, the Invicta Dynamics.\nIn rugby union, Tonbridge Juddians and Canterbury RFC play in the fourth tier of English rugby in the National League 2 East and similar level. Gravesend RFC play in the seventh-tier London 2 South-East (Regional 2 South East). Blackheath RFC, a club within the historic boundaries of the county, played in the third tier (National league 1) until being relegated at the end of the 2021\u201322 season. \nThe Brands Hatch circuit near Swanley has played host to a number of national and international racing events and hosted 12 runnings of the British Grand Prix between 1964 and 1986.\nThere have been multiple American football teams based in Kent since the game was popularised in the UK. Currently, Canterbury is the home of the East Kent Mavericks, the 2023 BAFA National Leagues Southern Football Conference 2 Champions, as well as teams from both universities.\nKent is home to two national-league netball clubs, both based in northwest Kent: Telstars (Premier Division 2) and KCNC (Premier Division 3).\nIn basketball, the Kent Panthers participate in Division 3 of the National Basketball League.\nThe 2021\u20132022 season saw three Kentish clubs demoted from the third tier of their respective sports to the fourth tier, with rugby clubs Tonbridge Juddians and Blackheath RFC being relegated in rugby and Gillingham F.C. being relegated in football.\nNews and media.\nTelevision.\nKent is served by the BBC's South East region, which is based in Tunbridge Wells and provides local news for the county and East Sussex. Its commercial rival is ITV Meridian Ltd, which has a newsroom at The Maidstone Studios despite the main studio being based in Hampshire. Main transmitters providing these services are at West Hougham, near Dover and Blue Bell Hill, between Chatham and Maidstone. A powerful relay transmitter at Tunbridge Wells serves the town and surrounding area. Those parts of Kent closest to London such as Swanley, Westerham, Dartford, Gravesend, and Sevenoaks lie within the ITV London and BBC London areas, taking their television signals from the Crystal Palace transmitter.\nRadio.\nKent has two county-wide stations \u2013 BBC Radio Kent, based in Tunbridge Wells; and the commercial station KMFM, owned by the KM Group. KMFM previously consisted of seven local stations which covered different areas of the county (and are still technically seven different licences) but have shared all programming since 2012\nThe county\u2019s first commercial station was originally known as Invicta (Invicta Sound/Invicta FM) and began broadcasting on 1 October 1984. After various buy-outs it was rebranded as Heart Kent in June 2009 as part of Global\u2019s Heart network roll-out, and in 2019 the station was merged with neighbouring Heart licences to form Heart South; Heart Kent\u2019s Whitstable studios closed in late May 2019 with regional production consolidated elsewhere (the merged regional service broadcasts from Fareham).\nThere are several community radio stations in Kent including:\nNewspapers.\nThe KM Group, KOS Media and Kent Regional News and Media all provide local newspapers for most of the large towns and cities. County-wide papers include the \"Kent Messenger\", \"Kent on Saturday\", \"Kent on Sunday\", and the \"Kent and Sussex Courier\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16767", "revid": "50611213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16767", "title": "King James Version", "text": "1611 English translation of the Bible\nThe King James Version (KJV), also referred to as the King James Bible and the Authorized Version, is an Early Modern English translation of the Christian Bible for the Church of England, which was commissioned in 1604 and published in 1611, by sponsorship of King James VI and I. The 80 books of the KJV include 39 books of the Old Testament, 14 books of Apocrypha, and the 27 books of the New Testament.\nNoted for its \"majesty of style,\" the KJV has remained in continuous use for over four centuries, exerting more influence on English literature and Christian thought than any other English Bible translation. Its phrasing has been credited with shaping not only hymnody and liturgy, but also the idioms of everyday speech used in the English-speaking world. It is considered one of the important literary accomplishments of early modern England. The original KJV is a 17th-century translation and thus contains a large number of archaisms and false friends\u2014words that contemporary readers may think they understand but that actually carry obsolete or unfamiliar meanings\u2014making understanding the text difficult for modern readers, even pastors and preachers trained in formal theological institutes. While the 1611 text reflects Early Modern English usage, subsequent standardizations\u2014most notably the 1769 Oxford edition and the more recent 1900 Pure Cambridge Edition\u2014have made the KJV considerably more accessible to later generations. Many scholars note that its sentence structure is often clearer and more direct than some modern versions, despite occasional obsolete vocabulary.\nThe King James Version was the third translation into English approved by the Church of England. The first had been the Great Bible in 1535, and the second had been the Bishops' Bible in 1568. Meanwhile in Switzerland, the first generation of Protestant Reformers had produced the Geneva Bible in 1560, which proved more popular among the laity. However, the footnotes represented a Calvinistic Puritanism.\nKing James convened the Hampton Court Conference in January 1604, responding to Puritan grievances outlined in the Millenary Petition. At this conference, a proposal for a new English translation of the Bible was presented, aiming to address perceived issues in existing versions. King James issued directives to ensure the translation adhered to the ecclesiology of the Church of England, reflecting its episcopal structure and doctrines, including the belief in an ordained clergy. Notably, translators were instructed to avoid marginal notes whenever possible, a feature in the Geneva Bible that had been criticized for promoting Puritanical and anti-monarchical sentiments. For the New Testament, the \"Textus Receptus\" was utilized; the Old Testament was translated from the Masoretic Text; and the Apocrypha was rendered from the Septuagint and Latin Vulgate.\nBy the first half of the 18th century, the King James Version had become effectively unchallenged as the only English translation used in Anglican and other English Protestant churches, except for the Psalms and some short passages in the \"Book of Common Prayer\" of the Church of England. Over the 18th century, the KJV supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English-speaking scholars. With the development of stereotype printing at the beginning of the 19th century, this version of the Bible had become the most widely printed book in history, almost all such printings presenting the standard text of 1769, and nearly always omitting the books of the Apocrypha. Today the unqualified title \"King James Version\" usually indicates this Oxford standard text.\nIn surveys of English-speaking Christians, the KJV frequently ranks among the most read and memorized translations, with many citing its literary cadence and perceived faithfulness to the original texts as reasons for its continued preference.\nName.\nThe title of the first edition of the translation, in Early Modern English, was \"THE HOLY BIBLE, Conteyning the Old Te\u017ftament, \"AND THE NEW: Newly Tran\u017flated out of the Originall tongues: &amp; with former Tran\u017flations diligently compared and reui\u017fed, by his Majesties \u017fpeciall Comandement\".\" Underneath the title, it is written that the Bible is \"[a]ppointed to be read in Churches.\" Biblical scholar F. F. Bruce suggests it was \"probably authorised by order in council,\" but no record of the authorization survives \"because the Privy Council registers from 1600 to 1613 were destroyed by fire in January 1618/19.\"\nFor many years it was common not to give the translation any specific name. In his \"Leviathan\" of 1651, Thomas Hobbes referred to it as \"the English Translation made in the beginning of the Reign of King James.\" A 1761 \"Brief Account of the various Translations of the Bible into English\" refers to the 1611 version merely as \"a new, compleat, and more accurate Translation,\" despite referring to the Great Bible by its name, and despite using the name \"Rhemish Testament\" for the Douay\u2013Rheims Bible version. Similarly, a \"History of England,\" whose fifth edition was published in 1775, writes merely that \"[a] new translation of the Bible, \"viz.\", that now in Use, was begun in 1607, and published in 1611.\"\nKing James's Bible is used as the name for the 1611 translation (on a par with the Genevan Bible or the Rhemish Testament) in Charles Butler's \"Horae Biblicae\" (first published 1797). Other works from the early 19th century confirm the widespread use of this name on both sides of the Atlantic: it is found both in a \"historical sketch of the English translations of the Bible\" published in Massachusetts in 1815 and in an English publication from 1818, which explicitly states that the 1611 version is \"generally known by the name of King James's Bible\". This name was also found as King James' Bible (without the final \"s\"): for example in a book review from 1811. The phrase \"King James's Bible\" is used as far back as 1715, although in this case it is not clear whether this is a name or merely a description.\nThe use of Authorized Version, capitalized and used as a name, is found as early as 1814. For some time before this, descriptive phrases such as \"our present, and only publicly authorised version\" (1783), \"our Authorized version\" (1731, 1792) and \"the authorized version\" (1801, uncapitalized) are found. A more common appellation in the 17th and 18th centuries was \"our English translation\" or \"our English version\", as can be seen by searching one or other of the major online archives of printed books. In Britain, the 1611 translation is generally known as the \"Authorised Version\" today.\nKing James' Version, evidently a descriptive phrase, is found being used as early as 1814. \"The King James Version\" is found, unequivocally used as a name, in a letter from 1855. The next year King James Bible, with no possessive, appears as a name in a Scottish source. In the United States, the \"1611 translation\" (actually editions following the standard text of 1769, see below) is generally known as the King James Version today.\nHistory.\nEarlier English translations.\nThere were several translations into Middle English of large portions of Scriptures in the 14th Century, with the first complete bibles probably being made by the followers of John Wycliffe. These translations were effectively but not formally banned in 1409 due to their association with the Lollards. The Wycliffite Bibles pre-dated the printing press but were circulated very widely in manuscript form.\nIn 1525, William Tyndale, an English contemporary of Martin Luther, undertook a translation of the New Testament into Early Modern English. Tyndale's translation was the first printed Bible in English. Over the next ten years, Tyndale revised his New Testament in the light of rapidly advancing biblical scholarship, and embarked on a translation of the Old Testament. Despite some controversial translation choices, and in spite of Tyndale's execution on charges of heresy for being a Lutheran, the merits of Tyndale's work and prose style made his translation the ultimate basis for all subsequent renditions into Early Modern English.\nWith these translations lightly edited and adapted by Myles Coverdale to remove offensive notes, in 1539, Tyndale's New Testament and his incomplete work on the Old Testament became the basis for the Great Bible. This was the first \"authorised version\" issued by the Church of England during the reign of King Henry VIII. When Mary I succeeded to the throne in 1553, she returned the Church of England to the communion of the Catholic faith and many English religious reformers fled the country, some establishing an English-speaking community in the Protestant city of Geneva. Under the leadership of John Calvin, Geneva became the chief international centre of Reformed Protestantism and Latin biblical scholarship.\nThese English expatriates undertook a translation that became known as the Geneva Bible. This translation, dated to 1560, was a revision of Tyndale's Bible and the Great Bible on the basis of the original languages. Soon after Elizabeth I took the throne in 1558, problems with both the Great and Geneva Bibles (namely, that the latter did not \"conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its beliefs about an ordained clergy\") became apparent to church authorities. In 1568, the Church of England responded with the Bishops' Bible, a revision of the Great Bible in the light of the Geneva version.\nWhile officially approved, this new version failed to displace the Geneva translation as the most popular English Bible of the age, in part because the full Bible was printed only in lectern editions of prodigious size and at a cost of several pounds. Accordingly, Elizabethan lay people overwhelmingly read the Bible in the Geneva Version, as small editions were available at a relatively low cost. At the same time, there was a substantial clandestine importation of the rival Douay\u2013Rheims New Testament of 1582, undertaken by exiled Catholics. This translation, though still derived from Tyndale, claimed to represent the text of the Latin Vulgate.\nIn May 1601, King James VI of Scotland attended the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland at Saint Columba's Church in Burntisland, Fife, at which proposals were put forward for a new translation of the Bible into English. Two years later, he ascended to the throne of England as James I.\nConsiderations for a new version.\nThe newly crowned King James convened the Hampton Court Conference in 1604. That gathering proposed a new English version in response to the perceived problems of earlier translations as detected by the Puritan faction of the Church of England. Here are three examples of problems the Puritans perceived with the \"Bishops\" and \"Great Bibles\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;First, Galatians iv. 25 (from the Bishops' Bible). The Greek word \"susoichei\" is not well translated as now it is, bordereth neither expressing the force of the word, nor the apostle's sense, nor the situation of the place. Secondly, psalm cv. 28 (from the Great Bible), 'They were not obedient;' the original being, 'They were not disobedient.' Thirdly, psalm cvi. 30 (also from the Great Bible), 'Then stood up Phinees and prayed,' the Hebrew hath, 'executed judgment.'\nInstructions were given to the translators that were intended to use formal equivalence and limit the Puritan influence on this new translation. The Bishop of London added a qualification that the translators would add no marginal notes (which had been an issue in the \"Geneva Bible\"). King James cited two passages in the Geneva translation where he found the marginal notes offensive to the principles of divinely ordained royal supremacy: Exodus 1:19, where the \"Geneva Bible\" notes had commended the example of civil disobedience to the Egyptian Pharaoh showed by the Hebrew midwives, and also II Chronicles 15:16, where the \"Geneva Bible\" had criticized King Asa for not having executed his idolatrous 'mother', Queen Maachah (Maachah had actually been Asa's grandmother, but James considered the Geneva Bible reference as sanctioning the execution of his own mother Mary, Queen of Scots).\nFurther, the King gave the translators instructions designed to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology of the Church of England. Certain Greek and Hebrew words were to be translated in a manner that reflected the traditional usage of the church. For example, old ecclesiastical words such as the word \"church\" were to be retained and not to be translated as \"congregation\". The new translation would reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and traditional beliefs about ordained clergy.\nThe source material for the translation of the New Testament was the Textus Receptus version of the Greek compiled by Erasmus; for the Old Testament, the Masoretic text of the Hebrew was used; for some of the apocrypha, the Septuagint Greek text was used, or for apocrypha for which the Greek was unavailable, the Vulgate Latin.\nJames' instructions included several requirements that kept the new translation familiar to its listeners and readers. The text of the Bishops' Bible would serve as the primary guide for the translators, and the familiar proper names of the biblical characters would all be retained. If the Bishops' Bible was deemed problematic in any situation, the translators were permitted to consult other translations from a pre-approved list: the Tyndale Bible, the Coverdale Bible, Matthew's Bible, the Great Bible, and the Geneva Bible. In addition, later scholars have detected an influence on the Authorized Version from the translations of Taverner's Bible and the New Testament of the Douay\u2013Rheims Bible. A recent estimate is that 84% of the New Testament in the KJV is word-for-word identical to the Tyndale Bible, and about 76% of Tyndale's incomplete Old Testament is in the KJV.\nIt is for this reason that the flyleaf of most printings of the Authorized Version observes that the text had been \"translated out of the original tongues, and with the former translations diligently compared and revised, by His Majesty's special commandment.\" As the work proceeded, more detailed rules were adopted as to how variant and uncertain readings in the Hebrew and Greek source texts should be indicated, including the requirement that words supplied in English to 'complete the meaning' of the originals should be printed in a different type face.\nTranslation committees.\nThe task of translation was undertaken by 47 scholars, although 54 were originally approved. All were members of the Church of England and all except Sir Henry Savile were clergy. The scholars worked in six committees, two based in each of the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, and Westminster. The committees included scholars with Puritan sympathies, as well as high churchmen. Forty unbound copies of the 1602 edition of the \"Bishops' Bible\" were specially printed so that the agreed changes of each committee could be recorded in the margins.\nThe committees worked on certain parts separately and the drafts produced by each committee were then compared and revised for harmony with each other. The scholars were not paid directly for their translation work. Instead, a circular letter was sent to bishops encouraging them to consider the translators for appointment to well-paid livings as these fell vacant. Several were supported by the various colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, while others were promoted to bishoprics, deaneries and prebends through royal patronage.\nOn 22 July 1604 King James VI and I sent a letter to Archbishop Bancroft asking him to contact all English churchmen requesting that they make donations to his project.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Right trusty and well beloved, we greet you well. Whereas we have appointed certain learned men, to the number of 4 and 50, for the translating of the Bible, and in this number, divers of them have either no ecclesiastical preferment at all, or else so very small, as the same is far unmeet for men of their deserts and yet we in ourself in any convenient time cannot well remedy it, therefor we do hereby require you, that presently you write in our name as well to the Archbishop of York, as to the rest of the bishops of the province of Cant.[erbury] signifying unto them, that we do well and straitly charge everyone of them ... that (all excuses set apart) when a prebend or parsonage ... shall next upon any occasion happen to be void ... we may commend for the same some such of the learned men, as we shall think fit to be preferred unto it ... Given unto our signet at our palace of West.[minister] on 2 and 20 July, in the 2nd year of our reign of England, France, and of Ireland, and of Scotland xxxvii.\nThe six committees started work towards the end of 1604. The Apocrypha committee finished first, and all six completed their sections by 1608. From January 1609, a General Committee of Review met at Stationers' Hall, London to review the completed marked texts from each of the committees, and were paid for their attendance by the Stationers' Company. The General Committee included John Bois, Andrew Downes, John Harmar, and others known only by their initials, including \"AL\" (who may be Arthur Lake). John Bois prepared a note of their deliberations (in Latin)\u00a0\u2013 which has partly survived in two later transcripts. Also surviving of the translators' working papers are a bound set of marked-up corrections to one of the forty \"Bishops' Bibles\"\u2014covering the Old Testament and Gospels; and also a manuscript translation of the text of the Epistles, excepting those verses where no change was being recommended to the readings in the \"Bishops' Bible\". Archbishop Bancroft insisted on having a final say making fourteen further changes, of which one was the term \"bishopricke\" at Acts 1:20.\nPrinting.\nThe original printing of the Authorized Version was published by Robert Barker, the King's Printer, in 1611 as a complete folio Bible. It was sold looseleaf for ten shillings, or bound for twelve. Robert Barker's father, Christopher, had, in 1589, been granted by Elizabeth I the title of royal Printer, with the perpetual Royal Privilege to print Bibles in England. Robert Barker invested very large sums in printing the new edition, and consequently ran into serious debt, such that he was compelled to sub-lease the privilege to two rival London printers, Bonham Norton and John Bill. It appears that it was initially intended that each printer would print a portion of the text, share printed sheets with the others, and split the proceeds. Bitter financial disputes broke out, as Barker accused Norton and Bill of concealing their profits, while Norton and Bill accused Barker of selling sheets properly due to them as partial Bibles for ready money. There followed decades of continual litigation, and consequent imprisonment for debt for members of the Barker and Norton printing dynasties, while each issued rival editions of the whole Bible. In 1629 the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge successfully managed to assert separate and prior royal licences for Bible printing, for their own university presses\u2014and Cambridge University took the opportunity to print revised editions of the Authorized Version in 1629, and 1638. The editors of these editions included John Bois and Samuel Ward from the original translators. This did not, however, impede the commercial rivalries of the London printers, especially as the Barker family refused to allow any other printers access to the authoritative manuscript of the Authorized Version.\nTwo editions of the whole Bible are recognized as having been produced in 1611, which may be distinguished by their rendering of Ruth 3:15; the first edition reading \"he went into the city\", where the second reads \"she went into the city\"; these are known colloquially as the \"He\" and \"She\" Bibles.\nThe original printing was made before English spelling was standardized, and when printers, as a matter of course, expanded and contracted the spelling of the same words in different places, so as to achieve an even column of text. They set v for initial u and v, and u for u and v everywhere else. They used the long s (\u017f) for non-final s. The letter or glyph j occurs only after i, as in the final letter in a Roman numeral, such as XIIJ. Punctuation was relatively heavy (frequent) and differed from modern practice. When space needed to be saved, the printers sometimes used \"ye\" for \"the\" (replacing the Middle English thorn, \u00de, with the continental y), set \u00e3 for \"an\" or \"am\" (in the style of scribe's shorthand), and set &amp; for \"and\". In contrast, on a few occasions, they appear to have inserted these words when they thought a line needed to be padded. Later printings regularized these spellings; the punctuation has also been standardized, but still varies from current usage.\nAs can be seen in the example page on the left, the first printing used a blackletter typeface instead of a roman typeface, which itself made a political and a religious statement. Like the Great Bible and the Bishops' Bible, the Authorized Version was \"appointed to be read in churches\". It was a large folio volume meant for public use, not private devotion; the weight of the type\u2014blackletter type was heavy physically as well as visually\u2014mirrored the weight of establishment authority behind it. However, smaller editions and roman-type editions followed rapidly, e.g. quarto roman-type editions of the Bible in 1612. This contrasted with the Geneva Bible, which was the first English Bible printed in a roman typeface (although black-letter editions, particularly in folio format, were issued later).\nIn contrast to the Geneva Bible and the Bishops' Bible, which had both been extensively illustrated, there were no illustrations in the 1611 edition of the Authorized Version, the main form of decoration being the historiated initial letters provided for books and chapters\u00a0\u2013 together with the decorative title pages to the Bible itself, and to the New Testament.\nIn the Great Bible, readings derived from the Vulgate but not found in published Hebrew and Greek texts had been distinguished by being printed in smaller roman type. In the Geneva Bible, a distinct typeface had instead been applied to distinguish text supplied by translators, or thought needful for English grammar but not present in the Greek or Hebrew; and the original printing of the Authorized Version used roman type for this purpose, albeit sparsely and inconsistently. This results in perhaps the most significant difference between the original printed text of the King James Bible and the current text. When, from the later 17th century onwards, the Authorized Version began to be printed in roman type, the typeface for supplied words was changed to italics, this application being regularized and greatly expanded. This was intended to de-emphasize the words.\nThe original printing contained two prefatory texts; the first was a formal \"\" to \"the most high and mighty Prince\" King James. Many British printings reproduce this, while most non-British printings do not.\nThe second preface was called \"\", a long and learned essay that defends the undertaking of the new version. It observes the translators' stated goal, that they \"never thought from the beginning that [they] should need to make a new translation, nor yet to make of a bad one a good one, ... but to make a good one better, or out of many good ones, one principal good one, not justly to be excepted against; that hath been our endeavour, that our mark.\" They also give their opinion of previous English Bible translations, stating, \"We do not deny, nay, we affirm and avow, that the very meanest translation of the Bible in English, set forth by men of our profession, (for we have seen none of theirs [Catholics] of the whole Bible as yet) containeth the word of God, nay, is the word of God.\" As with the first preface, some British printings reproduce this, while most non-British printings do not. Almost every printing that includes the second preface also includes the first.\nThe first printing contained a number of other apparatus, including a table for the reading of the Psalms at matins and evensong, and a calendar, an almanac, and a table of holy days and observances. Much of this material became obsolete with the adoption of the Gregorian calendar by Britain and its colonies in 1752, and thus modern editions invariably omit it.\nSo as to make it easier to know a particular passage, each chapter was headed by a brief pr\u00e9cis of its contents with verse numbers. Later editors freely substituted their own chapter summaries, or omitted such material entirely. Pilcrow marks are used to indicate the beginnings of paragraphs except after the book of Acts.\nAuthorized Version.\nThe Authorized Version was meant to replace the Bishops' Bible as the official version for readings in the Church of England. No record of its authorization exists; it was probably effected by an order of the Privy Council, but the records for the years 1600 to 1613 were destroyed by fire in January 1618/19, and it is commonly known as the Authorized Version in the United Kingdom. The King's Printer issued no further editions of the Bishops' Bible, so necessarily the Authorized Version replaced it as the standard lectern Bible in parish church use in England.\nIn the 1662 \"Book of Common Prayer\", the text of the Authorized Version finally supplanted that of the Great Bible in the Epistle and Gospel readings\u2014though the Prayer Book Psalter nevertheless continues in the Great Bible version.\nThe case was different in Scotland, where the Geneva Bible had long been the standard church Bible. It was not until 1633 that a Scottish edition of the Authorized Version was printed\u2014in conjunction with the Scots coronation in that year of Charles I. The inclusion of illustrations in the edition raised accusations of Popery from opponents of the religious policies of Charles and William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. However, official policy favoured the Authorized Version, and this favour returned during the Commonwealth\u2014as London printers succeeded in re-asserting their monopoly on Bible printing with support from Oliver Cromwell\u2014and the \"New Translation\" was the only edition on the market. F. F. Bruce reports that the last recorded instance of a Scots parish continuing to use the \"Old Translation\" (i.e. Geneva) as being in 1674.\nThe Authorized Version's acceptance by the general public took longer. The Geneva Bible continued to be popular, and large numbers were imported from Amsterdam, where printing continued up to 1644 in editions carrying a false London imprint. However, few if any genuine Geneva editions appear to have been printed in London after 1616, and in 1637 Archbishop Laud prohibited their printing or importation. In the period of the English Civil War, soldiers of the New Model Army were issued a book of Geneva selections called \"The Soldiers' Bible\". In the first half of the 17th century the Authorized Version is most commonly referred to as \"The Bible without notes\", thereby distinguishing it from the Geneva \"Bible with notes\".\nThere were several printings of the Authorized Version in Amsterdam\u2014one as late as 1715 which combined the Authorized Version translation text with the Geneva marginal notes; one such edition was printed in London in 1649. During the Commonwealth a commission was established by Parliament to recommend a revision of the Authorized Version with acceptably Protestant explanatory notes, but the project was abandoned when it became clear that these would nearly double the bulk of the Bible text. After the English Restoration, the Geneva Bible was held to be politically suspect and a reminder of the repudiated Puritan era. Furthermore, disputes over the lucrative rights to print the Authorized Version dragged on through the 17th century, so none of the printers involved saw any commercial advantage in marketing a rival translation. The Authorized Version became the only then current version circulating among English-speaking people.\nA small minority of critical scholars were slow to accept the latest translation. Hugh Broughton, who was the most highly regarded English Hebraist of his time but had been excluded from the panel of translators because of his utterly uncongenial temperament, issued in 1611 a total condemnation of the new version. He especially criticized the translators' rejection of word-for-word equivalence and stated that \"he would rather be torn in pieces by wild horses than that this abominable translation (KJV) should ever be foisted upon the English people\". Walton's London Polyglot of 1657 disregards the Authorized Version (and indeed the English language) entirely. Walton's reference text throughout is the Vulgate.\nThe Vulgate Latin is also found as the standard text of scripture in Thomas Hobbes's \"Leviathan\" of 1651. Hobbes gives Vulgate chapter and verse numbers (e.g., Job 41:24, not Job 41:33) for his head text. In Chapter 35: \"The Signification in Scripture of Kingdom of God\", Hobbes discusses Exodus 19:5, first in his own translation of the Vulgar Latin, and then subsequently as found in the versions he terms \"... the English translation made in the beginning of the reign of King James\", and \"The Geneva French\" (i.e. Oliv\u00e9tan). Hobbes advances detailed critical arguments why the Vulgate rendering is to be preferred. For most of the 17th century the assumption remained that, while it had been of vital importance to provide the scriptures in the vernacular for ordinary people, nevertheless for those with sufficient education to do so, Biblical study was best undertaken within the international common medium of Latin. It was only in 1700 that modern bilingual Bibles appeared in which the Authorized Version was compared with counterpart Dutch and French Protestant vernacular Bibles.\nIn consequence of the continual disputes over printing privileges, successive printings of the Authorized Version were notably less careful than the 1611 edition had been\u2014compositors freely varying spelling, capitalization and punctuation\u2014and also, over the years, introducing about 1,500 misprints (some of which, like the omission of \"not\" from the commandment \"Thou shalt not commit adultery\" in the \"Wicked Bible\", became notorious). The two Cambridge editions of 1629 and 1638 attempted to restore the proper text\u2014while introducing over 200 revisions of the original translators' work, chiefly by incorporating into the main text a more literal reading originally presented as a marginal note. A more thoroughly corrected edition was proposed following the Restoration, in conjunction with the revised 1662 \"Book of Common Prayer\", but Parliament then decided against it.\nBy the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the sole English translation in then current use in Protestant churches, and was so dominant that the Catholic Church in England issued in 1750 a revision of the 1610 Douay\u2013Rheims Bible by Richard Challoner that was much closer to the Authorized Version than to the original. However, general standards of spelling, punctuation, typesetting, capitalization and grammar had changed radically in the 100 years since the first edition of the Authorized Version, and all printers in the market were introducing continual piecemeal changes to their Bible texts to bring them into line with then current practice\u2014and with public expectations of standardized spelling and grammatical construction.\nOver the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Hebrew, Greek and the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars and divines, and indeed came to be regarded by some as an inspired text in itself\u2014so much so that any challenge to its readings or textual base came to be regarded by many as an assault on Holy Scripture.\nIn the 18th century there was a serious shortage of Bibles in the American colonies. To meet the demand various printers, beginning with Samuel Kneeland in 1752, printed the King James Bible without authorization from the Crown. To avert prosecution and detection of an unauthorized printing they would include the royal insignia on the title page, using the same materials in its printing as the Authorized Version was produced from, which were imported from England.\nStandard text of 1769.\nBy the mid-18th century the wide variation in the various modernized printed texts of the Authorized Version, combined with the notorious accumulation of misprints, had reached the proportion of a scandal, and the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge both sought to produce an updated standard text. First of the two was the Cambridge edition of 1760, the culmination of 20 years' work by Francis Sawyer Parris, who died in May of that year. This 1760 edition was reprinted without change in 1762 and in John Baskerville's folio edition of 1763.\nThis was effectively superseded by the 1769 Oxford edition, edited by Benjamin Blayney, though with comparatively few changes from Parris's edition; but which became the Oxford standard text, and is reproduced almost unchanged in most current printings. Parris and Blayney sought consistently to remove those elements of the 1611 and subsequent editions that they believed were due to the vagaries of printers, while incorporating most of the revised readings of the Cambridge editions of 1629 and 1638, and each also introducing a few improved readings of their own.\nThey undertook the mammoth task of standardizing the wide variation in punctuation and spelling of the original, making many thousands of minor changes to the text. In addition, Blayney and Parris thoroughly revised and greatly extended the italicization of \"supplied\" words not found in the original languages by cross-checking against the presumed source texts. Blayney seems to have worked from the 1550 Stephanus edition of the Textus Receptus, rather than the later editions of Theodore Beza that the translators of the 1611 New Testament had favoured; accordingly the current Oxford standard text alters around a dozen italicizations where Beza and Stephanus differ. Like the 1611 edition, the 1769 Oxford edition included the Apocrypha, although Blayney tended to remove cross-references to the Books of the Apocrypha from the margins of their Old and New Testaments wherever these had been provided by the original translators. It also includes both prefaces from the 1611 edition. Altogether, the standardization of spelling and punctuation caused Blayney's 1769 text to differ from the 1611 text in around 24,000 places.\nThe 1611 and 1769 texts of the first three verses from \"I Corinthians 13\" are given below.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[1611] 1. Though I speake with the tongues of men &amp; of Angels, and haue not charity, I am become as sounding brasse or a tinkling cymbal. 2 And though I haue the gift of prophesie, and vnderstand all mysteries and all knowledge: and though I haue all faith, so that I could remooue mountaines, and haue no charitie, I am nothing. 3 And though I bestowe all my goods to feede the poore, and though I giue my body to bee burned, and haue not charitie, it profiteth me nothing.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[1769] 1. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become \"as\" sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. 2 And though I have \"the gift of\" prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed \"the poor\", and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\nThere are a number of superficial edits in these three verses: 11 changes of spelling, 16 changes of typesetting (including the changed conventions for the use of u and v), three changes of punctuation, and one variant text\u2014where \"not charity\" is substituted for \"no charity\" in verse two, in the belief that the original reading was a misprint.\nA particular verse for which Blayney's 1769 text differs from Parris's 1760 version is Matthew 5:13, where Parris (1760) has\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out, and to be troden under foot of men.\nBlayney (1769) changes 'lost his savour' to 'lost its savour', and troden to trodden.\nFor a period, Cambridge continued to issue Bibles using the Parris text, but the market demand for absolute standardization was now such that they eventually adapted Blayney's work but omitted some of the idiosyncratic Oxford spellings. By the mid-19th century, almost all printings of the Authorized Version were derived from the 1769 Oxford text\u2014increasingly without Blayney's variant notes and cross references, and commonly excluding the Apocrypha. One exception to this was a scrupulous original-spelling, page-for-page, and line-for-line reprint of the 1611 edition (including all chapter headings, marginalia, and original italicization, but with Roman type substituted for the black letter of the original), published by Oxford in 1833.\nAnother important exception was the 1873 Cambridge Paragraph Bible, thoroughly revised, modernized and re-edited by F. H. A. Scrivener, who for the first time consistently identified the source texts underlying the 1611 translation and its marginal notes. Scrivener, like Blayney, opted to revise the translation where he considered the judgement of the 1611 translators had been faulty. In 2005, Cambridge University Press released its New Cambridge Paragraph Bible with Apocrypha, edited by David Norton, which followed in the spirit of Scrivener's work, attempting to bring spelling to present-day standards. Norton also innovated with the introduction of quotation marks, while returning to a hypothetical 1611 text, so far as possible, to the wording used by its translators, especially in the light of the re-emphasis on some of their draft documents. This text has been issued in paperback by Penguin Books.\nFrom the early 19th century the Authorized Version has remained almost completely unchanged\u2014and since, due to advances in printing technology, it could now be produced in very large editions for mass sale, it established complete dominance in public and ecclesiastical use in the English-speaking Protestant world. Academic debate through that century, however, increasingly reflected concerns about the Authorized Version shared by some scholars: (a) that subsequent study in oriental languages suggested a need to revise the translation of the Hebrew Bible\u2014both in terms of specific vocabulary, and also in distinguishing descriptive terms from proper names; (b) that the Authorized Version was unsatisfactory in translating the same Greek words and phrases into different English, especially where parallel passages are found in the synoptic gospels; and (c) in the light of subsequent ancient manuscript discoveries, the New Testament translation base of the Greek Textus Receptus could no longer be considered to be the best representation of the original text.\nResponding to these concerns, the Convocation of Canterbury resolved in 1870 to undertake a revision of the text of the Authorized Version, intending to retain the original text \"except where in the judgement of competent scholars such a change is necessary\". The resulting revision was issued as the Revised Version in 1881 (New Testament), 1885 (Old Testament) and 1894 (Apocrypha); but, although it sold widely, the revision did not find popular favour, and it was only reluctantly in 1899 that Convocation approved it for reading in churches.\nBy the early 20th century, editing had been completed in Cambridge's text, with at least 6 new changes since 1769, and the reversing of at least 30 of the standard Oxford readings. The distinct Cambridge text was printed in the millions, and after the Second World War \"the unchanging steadiness of the KJB was a huge asset.\"\nIt is also worth noting that some American publishers use the 1769 text, but with updated American spelling. Words like \"colour\" will be spelled as \"color\" and names like \"Elias\" will be rendered as \"Elijah\" in the New Testament.\nEditorial criticism.\nF. H. A. Scrivener and D. Norton have both written in detail on editorial variations which have occurred through the history of the publishing of the Authorized Version from 1611 to 1769. In the 19th century, there were effectively three main guardians of the text. Norton identified five variations among the Oxford, Cambridge, and London (Eyre and Spottiswoode) texts of 1857, such as the spelling of \"farther\" or \"further\" at Matthew 26:39.\nIn the 20th century, variation between the editions was reduced to comparing the Cambridge to the Oxford. Distinctly identified Cambridge readings included \"or Sheba\", \"sin\", \"clifts\", \"vapour\", \"flieth\", \"further\" and a number of other references. In effect the Cambridge was considered the current text in comparison to the Oxford. These are instances where both Oxford and Cambridge have now diverged from Blayney's 1769 Edition. The distinctions between the Oxford and Cambridge editions have been a major point in the Bible version debate, and a potential theological issue, particularly in regard to the identification of the Pure Cambridge Edition.\nCambridge University Press introduced a change at 1 John 5:8 in 1985, reversing its longstanding tradition of printing the word \"spirit\" in lower case by using a capital letter \"S\". A Rev. Hardin of Bedford, Pennsylvania, wrote a letter to Cambridge inquiring about this verse, and received a reply on 3 June 1985 from the Bible Director, Jerry L. Hooper, claiming that it was a \"matter of some embarrassment regarding the lower case 's' in Spirit\".\nLiterary attributes.\nMarginal notes.\nIn obedience to their instructions, the translators provided no marginal interpretation of the text, but in some 8,500 places a marginal note offers an alternative English wording. The majority of these notes offer a more literal rendering of the original, introduced as \"Heb\", \"Chal\" (Chaldee, referring to Aramaic), \"Gr\" or \"Lat\". Others indicate a variant reading of the source text (introduced by \"or\"). Some of the annotated variants derive from alternative editions in the original languages, or from variant forms quoted in the fathers. More commonly, though, they indicate a difference between the literal original language reading and that in the translators' preferred recent Latin versions: Tremellius for the Old Testament, Junius for the Apocrypha, and Beza for the New Testament. At thirteen places in the New Testament a marginal note records a variant reading found in some Greek manuscript copies; in almost all cases reproducing a counterpart textual note at the same place in Beza's editions.\nA few more extensive notes clarify Biblical names and units of measurement or currency. Modern reprintings rarely reproduce these annotated variants, although they are to be found in the New Cambridge Paragraph Bible. In addition, there were originally some 9,000 scriptural cross-references, in which one text was related to another. Such cross-references had long been common in Latin Bibles, and most of those in the Authorized Version were copied unaltered from this Latin tradition. Consequently the early editions of the KJV retain many Vulgate verse references\u2014e.g. in the numbering of the Psalms. At the head of each chapter, the translators provided a short pr\u00e9cis of its contents, with verse numbers; these are rarely included in complete form in modern editions.\nUse of typeface.\nAlso in obedience to their instructions, the translators indicated 'supplied' words in a different typeface; but there was no attempt to regularize the instances where this practice had been applied across the different companies; and especially in the New Testament, it was used much less frequently in the 1611 edition than would later be the case. In one verse, 1 John 2:23, an entire clause was printed in roman type (as it had also been in the Great Bible and Bishops' Bible); indicating a reading then primarily derived from the Vulgate, albeit one for which the later editions of Beza had provided a Greek text.\nIn the Old Testament the translators render the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) by \"the LORD\" (in later editions in small capitals as LORD), or \"the LORD God\" (for \"YHWH Elohim\", \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd), except in four places by \"IEHOVAH\". However, if the Tetragrammaton occurs with the Hebrew word (Lord) then it is rendered not as the \"Lord LORD\" but as the \"Lord God\". In later editions it appears as \"Lord GOD\", with \"GOD\" in small capitals, indicating to the reader that God's name appears in the original Hebrew.\nSource texts.\nOld Testament.\nFor the Old Testament, the translators used a text originating in the editions of the Hebrew Rabbinic Bible by Daniel Bomberg (1524/5), but adjusted this to conform to the Greek Septuagint (LXX) or Latin Vulgate in passages to which Christian tradition had attached a Christological interpretation. For example, the Septuagint reading \"\" was used in Psalm 22:16 (vs. the Masoretes' reading of the Hebrew \"like lions my hands and feet\"). Otherwise, however, the Authorized Version is closer to the Hebrew tradition than any previous English translation\u2014especially in making use of the rabbinic commentaries, such as David Kimhi, in elucidating obscure passages in the Masoretic Text; earlier versions had been more likely to adopt LXX or Vulgate readings in such places. Following the practice of the Geneva Bible, the books of 1 Esdras and 2 Esdras in the medieval Vulgate Old Testament were renamed 'Ezra' and 'Nehemiah'; 3 Esdras and 4 Esdras in the Apocrypha being renamed '1 Esdras' and '2 Esdras'.\nNew Testament.\nFor the New Testament, the translators chiefly used the 1598 and 1588/89 Greek editions of Theodore Beza, which also present Beza's Latin version of the Greek and Stephanus's edition of the Latin Vulgate. Both of these versions were extensively referred to, as the translators conducted all discussions amongst themselves in Latin. F. H. A. Scrivener identifies 190 readings where the Authorized Version translators depart from Beza's Greek text, generally in maintaining the wording of the \"Bishops' Bible\" and other earlier English translations. In about half of these instances, the Authorized Version translators appear to follow the earlier 1550 Greek Textus Receptus of Stephanus. For the other half, Scrivener was usually able to find corresponding Greek readings in the editions of Erasmus, or in the Complutensian Polyglot. However, in several dozen readings he notes that no printed Greek text corresponds to the English of the Authorized Version, which in these places derives directly from the Vulgate. For example, at John 10:16, the Authorized Version reads \" (as did the Bishops' Bible, and the 16th-century vernacular versions produced in Geneva), following the Latin Vulgate \", whereas Tyndale had agreed more closely with the Greek, \"\" (). The Authorized Version New Testament owes much more to the Vulgate than does the Old Testament; still, at least 80% of the text is unaltered from Tyndale's translation.\nApocrypha.\nUnlike the rest of the Bible, the translators of the Apocrypha identified their source texts in their marginal notes. From these it can be determined that the books of the Apocrypha were translated from the Septuagint\u2014primarily, from the Greek Old Testament column in the Antwerp Polyglot\u2014but with extensive reference to the counterpart Latin Vulgate text, and to Junius's Latin translation. The translators record references to the Sixtine Septuagint of 1587, which is substantially a printing of the Old Testament text from the Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209, and also to the 1518 Greek Septuagint edition of Aldus Manutius. They had, however, no Greek texts for 2 Esdras, or for the Prayer of Manasses, and Scrivener found that they here used an unidentified Latin manuscript.\nSources.\nThe translators appear to have otherwise made no first-hand study of ancient manuscript sources, even those that\u2014like the Codex Bezae\u2014would have been readily available to them. In addition to all previous English versions (including, and contrary to their instructions, the \"Rheimish New Testament\" which in their preface they criticized), they made wide and eclectic use of all printed editions in the original languages then available, including the ancient Syriac New Testament printed with an interlinear Latin gloss in the Antwerp Polyglot of 1573. In the preface the translators acknowledge consulting translations and commentaries in Chaldee, Hebrew, Syrian, Greek, Latin, Spanish, French, Italian, and German.\nThe translators took the Bishops' Bible as their source text, and where they departed from that in favour of another translation, this was most commonly the Geneva Bible. However, the degree to which readings from the Bishops' Bible survived into final text of the King James Bible varies greatly from company to company, as did the propensity of the King James translators to coin phrases of their own. John Bois's notes of the General Committee of Review show that they discussed readings derived from a wide variety of versions and patristic sources, including explicitly both Henry Savile's 1610 edition of the works of John Chrysostom and the Rheims New Testament, which was the primary source for many of the literal alternative readings provided for the marginal notes.\nVariations in recent translations.\nA number of Bible verses in the King James Version of the New Testament are not found in more recent Bible translations, where these are based on modern critical texts. In the early seventeenth century, the source Greek texts of the New Testament which were used to produce Protestant Bible versions were mainly dependent on manuscripts of the late Byzantine text-type, and they also contained minor variations which became known as the Textus Receptus. With the subsequent identification of much earlier manuscripts, most modern textual scholars value the evidence of manuscripts which belong to the Alexandrian family as better witnesses to the original text of the biblical authors, without giving it, or any family, automatic preference.\nStyle and criticism.\nA primary concern of the translators was to produce an appropriate Bible, dignified and resonant in public reading. Although the Authorized Version's written style is an important part of its influence on English, research has found only one verse\u2014Hebrews 13:8\u2014for which translators debated the wording's literary merits. While they stated in the preface that they used stylistic variation, finding multiple English words or verbal forms in places where the original language employed repetition, in practice they also did the opposite; for example, 14 different Hebrew words were translated into the single English word \"prince\".\nIn a period of rapid linguistic change the translators avoided contemporary idioms, tending instead towards forms that were already slightly archaic, like \"verily\" and \"it came to pass\". The pronouns \"thou\"/\"thee\" and \"ye\"/\"you\" are consistently used as singular and plural respectively, even though by this time \"you\" was often found as the singular in general English usage, especially when addressing a social superior (as is evidenced, for example, in Shakespeare). For the possessive of the third person pronoun, the word \"its\", first recorded in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in 1598, is avoided. The older \"his\" is usually employed, as for example at Matthew 5:13: \"if the salt have lost \"his\" savour, wherewith shall it be salted?\"; in other places \"of it\", \"thereof\" or bare \"it\" are found. Another sign of linguistic conservatism is the invariable use of \"-eth\" for the third person singular present form of the verb, as at Matthew 2:13: \"the Angel of the Lord appear\"eth\" to Joseph in a dreame\". The rival ending \"-(e)s\", as found in present-day English, was already widely used by this time (for example, it predominates over \"-eth\" in the plays of Shakespeare and Marlowe). Furthermore, the translators preferred \"which\" to \"who\" or \"whom\" as the relative pronoun for persons, as in Genesis 13:5: \"And Lot also \"which\" went with Abram, had flocks and heards, &amp; tents\" although \"who(m)\" is also found.\nThe Authorized Version is notably more Latinate than previous English versions, especially the Geneva Bible. This results in part from the academic stylistic preferences of a number of the translators\u2014several of whom admitted to being more comfortable writing in Latin than in English\u2014but was also, in part, a consequence of the royal proscription against explanatory notes. Hence, where the Geneva Bible might use a common English word, and gloss its particular application in a marginal note, the Authorized Version tends rather to prefer a technical term, frequently in Anglicized Latin. Consequently, although the King had instructed the translators to use the Bishops' Bible as a base text, the New Testament in particular owes much stylistically to the Catholic Rheims New Testament, whose translators had also been concerned to find English equivalents for Latin terminology. In addition, the translators of the New Testament books transliterate names found in the Old Testament in their Greek forms rather than in the forms closer to the Old Testament Hebrew (e.g. \"Elias\" and \"Noe\" for \"Elijah\" and \"Noah\", respectively).\nWhile the Authorized Version remains among the most widely sold, modern critical New Testament translations differ substantially from it in a number of passages, primarily because they rely on source manuscripts not then accessible to (or not then highly regarded by) early-17th-century Biblical scholarship. In the Old Testament, there are also many differences from modern translations that are based not on manuscript differences, but on a different understanding of Ancient Hebrew vocabulary or grammar by the translators. For example, in modern translations it is clear that Job 28:1\u201311 is referring throughout to mining operations, which is not at all apparent from the text of the Authorized Version.\nMistranslations.\nThe King James Version contains several alleged mistranslations, especially in the Old Testament where the knowledge of Hebrew and cognate languages was uncertain at the time. Among the most commonly cited errors is in the Hebrew of Job and Deuteronomy, where with the probable meaning of \"wild-ox, aurochs\", is translated in the KJV as \"unicorn\"; following in this the Vulgate \"unicornis\" and several medieval rabbinic commentators. The translators of the KJV note the alternative rendering, \"rhinocerots\" [\"sic\"] in the margin at Isaiah 34:7. On a similar note Martin Luther's German translation had also relied on the Latin Vulgate on this point, consistently translating \u05e8\u05b0\u05d0\u05b5\u05dd using the German word for unicorn, \"Einhorn\". Otherwise, the translators are accused on several occasions of having mistakenly interpreted a Hebrew descriptive phrase as a proper name (or vice versa); as at 2 Samuel 1:18 where 'the Book of Jasher' properly refers not to a work by an author of that name, but should rather be rendered as \"the Book of the Upright\" (which was proposed as an alternative reading in a marginal note to the KJV text).\nInfluence.\nDespite royal patronage and encouragement, there was never any overt mandate to use the new translation. It was not until 1661 that the Authorized Version replaced the Bishops' Bible in the Epistle and Gospel lessons of the \"Book of Common Prayer\", and it never did replace the older translation in the Psalter. In 1763 \"The Critical Review\" complained that \"many false interpretations, ambiguous phrases, obsolete words and indelicate expressions ... excite the derision of the scorner\". Blayney's 1769 version, with its revised spelling and punctuation, helped change the public perception of the Authorized Version to a masterpiece of the English language. By the 19th century, F. W. Faber could say of the translation, \"It lives on the ear, like music that can never be forgotten, like the sound of church bells, which the convert hardly knows how he can forego.\"\nGeddes MacGregor called the Authorized Version \"the most influential version of the most influential book in the world, in what is now its most influential language\", \"the most important book in English religion and culture\", and \"the most celebrated book in the English-speaking world\". David Crystal has estimated that it is responsible for 257 idioms in English; examples include feet of clay and reap the whirlwind. Furthermore, prominent atheist figures such as Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins have praised the King James Version as being \"a giant step in the maturing of English literature\" and \"a great work of literature\", respectively, with Dawkins then adding, \"A native speaker of English who has never read a word of the King James Bible is verging on the barbarian\".\nThe King James Version is one of the versions authorized to be used in the services of the Episcopal Church and other parts of the Anglican Communion, as it is the historical Bible of this church. \nIt was presented to King Charles III at his coronation service.\nOther Christian denominations have also accepted the King James Version. The King James Version is used by English-speaking Conservative Anabaptists, along with Methodists of the conservative holiness movement, in addition to certain Baptists. In the Orthodox Church in America, it is used liturgically and was made \"the 'official' translation for a whole generation of American Orthodox\". The later Service Book of the Antiochian archdiocese, in vogue today, also uses the King James Version. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints continues to use its own edition of the Authorized Version as its official English Bible.\nAlthough the Authorized Version's preeminence in the English-speaking world has diminished\u2014for example, the Church of England recommends six other versions in addition to it\u2014it is still the most used translation in the United States, especially as the Scofield Reference Bible for Evangelicals. However, over the past forty years it has been gradually overtaken by modern versions, principally the New International Version (1973), the New Revised Standard Version (1989), and the English Standard Version (2001), the latter of which is seen as a successor to the King James Version.\nKing James Only movement.\nThe King James Only movement advocates the belief that the King James Version is superior to all other English translations of the Bible. Most adherents of the movement believe that the Textus Receptus is very close, if not identical, to the original autographs, thereby making it the ideal Greek source for the translation. They argue that manuscripts such as the Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus, on which most modern English translations are based, are corrupted New Testament texts. One of them, Perry Demopoulos, was a director of the translation of the King James Bible into Russian. In 2010 the Russian translation of the KJV of the New Testament was released in Kyiv, Ukraine. In 2017, the first complete edition of a Russian King James Bible was released. In 2017, a Faroese translation of the King James Bible was released as well.\nCopyright status.\nThe Authorized Version is in the public domain in most of the world. In the United Kingdom, the right to print, publish and distribute it is a royal prerogative, and the Crown licenses publishers to reproduce it under letters patent. In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the letters patent are held by the King's Printer; in Scotland, they are held by the Scottish Bible Board. The office of the King's Printer has been associated with the right to reproduce the Bible for centuries, the earliest known reference coming in 1577.\nIn the 18th century, all surviving interests in the monopoly were bought out by John Baskett. The Baskett rights descended through a number of printers and, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the King's Printer is now Cambridge University Press, which inherited the right when they took over the firm of Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode in 1990.\nOther royal charters of similar antiquity grant Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press the right to produce the Authorized Version independently of the King's Printer. In Scotland, the Authorized Version is published by Collins under licence from the Scottish Bible Board. The terms of the letters patent prohibit any other than the holders, or those authorized by the holders, from printing, publishing or importing the Authorized Version into the United Kingdom. The protection that the Authorized Version, and also the \"Book of Common Prayer,\" enjoy is the last remnant of the time when the Crown held a monopoly over all printing and publishing in the United Kingdom.\nAlthough Crown Copyright usually expires 50 years after publication, Section 171(b) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 made an exception for 'any right or privilege of the Crown' not written in an act of parliament, thus preserving the rights of the Crown under the unwritten royal prerogative.\nPermission.\nWithin the United Kingdom, Cambridge University Press permits the reproduction of at most 500 words for \"liturgical and non-commercial educational use\", provided that their prescribed acknowledgement is included, the quoted words do not exceed 25% of the publication quoting them and do not include a complete Bible book. For use beyond this, the Press is willing to consider permission requested on a case-by-case basis and in 2011 a spokesman said the Press generally does not charge a fee but tries to ensure that a reputable source text is used.\nApocrypha.\nTranslations of the books of the biblical apocrypha were necessary for the King James version, as readings from these books were included in the daily Old Testament lectionary of the Book of Common Prayer. Protestant Bibles in the 16th century included the books of the apocrypha\u2014generally, following the Luther Bible, in a separate section between the Old and New Testaments to indicate they were not considered part of the Old Testament text\u2014and there is evidence that these were widely read as popular literature, especially in Puritan circles.\nThe apocrypha of the King James Version has the same 14 books as had been found in the apocrypha of the Bishops' Bible; however, following the practice of the Geneva Bible, the first two books of the apocrypha were renamed 1 Esdras and 2 Esdras, as compared to the names in the Thirty-nine Articles, with the corresponding Old Testament books being renamed Ezra and Nehemiah. Starting in 1630, volumes of the \"Geneva Bible\" were occasionally bound with the pages of the apocrypha section excluded. In 1644, the Long Parliament forbade the reading of the apocrypha in churches; and in 1666, the first editions of the King James Bible without the apocrypha were bound.\nThe standardization of the text of the Authorized Version after 1769 together with the technological development of stereotype printing made it possible to produce Bibles in large print-runs at very low unit prices. For commercial and charitable publishers, editions of the Authorized Version without the apocrypha reduced the cost, while having increased market appeal to non-Anglican Protestant readers.\nWith the rise of the Bible societies, most editions have omitted the whole section of apocryphal books. The British and Foreign Bible Society withdrew subsidies for Bible printing and dissemination in 1826, under the following resolution:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That the funds of the Society be applied to the printing and circulation of the Canonical Books of Scripture, to the exclusion of those Books and parts of Books usually termed Apocryphal;\nThe American Bible Society adopted a similar policy. Both societies eventually reversed these policies in light of 20th-century ecumenical efforts on translations, the ABS doing so in 1964 and the BFBS in 1966.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Known for his work on stage and screen, he has received numerous accolades, including two Academy Awards, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, and two Laurence Olivier Awards as well as nominations for 12 Emmy Awards.\nSpacey began his film career with small roles in Mike Nichols's comedy-drama films \"Heartburn\" (1986) and \"Working Girl\" (1988). He won two Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actor for playing a con man in \"The Usual Suspects\" (1995) and Best Actor for playing a suburban husband and father going through a midlife crisis in \"American Beauty\" (1999). His other films include \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" (1992), \"Outbreak\" (1995), \"Se7en\" (1995), \"A Time to Kill\" (1996), \"L.A. Confidential\" (1997), \"Pay It Forward\" (2000), \"Superman Returns\" (2006), \"21\" (2008), \"Margin Call\" (2011), \"Horrible Bosses\" (2011), and \"Baby Driver\" (2017). He has also directed the films \"Albino Alligator\" (1996) and \"Beyond the Sea\" (2004).\nIn Broadway theatre, Spacey starred in a revival of Eugene O'Neill's \"Long Day's Journey into Night\" in 1986. He won a Tony Award in 1991 for his role in \"Lost in Yonkers\". He won a Laurence Olivier Award for his performance in a revival of \"The Iceman Cometh\" in 1999. Spacey portrayed the title role in \"Richard III\" in 2011 and Clarence Darrow in a West End production of \"Darrow\" in 2015. He was the artistic director of the Old Vic theatre in London from 2004 to 2015, for which he received the Society of London Theatre Special Award. He was named an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2015. In 2017, he hosted the 71st Tony Awards.\nIn television, Spacey portrayed Ron Klain in \"Recount\" (2008) and produced \"Bernard and Doris\" (2008), both for HBO Films. From 2013 to 2017, he starred as Frank Underwood in the Netflix political drama series \"House of Cards\", which won him a Golden Globe Award and two consecutive Screen Actors Guild Awards for Best Actor. Both Spacey and the show itself were nominated for five consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Drama Series, respectively.\nIn 2017, Spacey faced several allegations of sexual misconduct. In 2018 and 2019, Spacey faced multiple criminal investigations; however, in each case Spacey was either not charged or the charges against him were dropped. He has denied the accusations and was found not liable in a 2022 lawsuit in New York. In a separate case in London, he was acquitted by a jury of sexual assault charges in 2023.\nEarly life, family and education.\nKevin Spacey Fowler was born in South Orange, New Jersey, to Kathleen Ann (\"n\u00e9e\" Knutson), a secretary, and Thomas Geoffrey Fowler, a technical writer and data consultant. His family relocated to Southern California when he was four years old. Spacey has a sister and an older brother, Randy Fowler, from whom Spacey is estranged. His brother has stated that their father, whom he described as a racist \"Nazi supporter\", was sexually and physically abusive, and that Spacey shut down emotionally and became \"very sly and smart\" to avoid beatings. Spacey first addressed the matter in October 2022, saying that his father was \"a white supremacist and a neo-Nazi\" who would call him \"an F-word that is very derogatory to the gay community\". He stated that, as a result, he became extremely private about his personal life and did not come out as gay earlier in his life. Spacey had previously described his father as \"a very normal, middle-class man\".\nSpacey attended Northridge Military Academy, Canoga Park High School in the 10th and 11th grades. He graduated co-valedictorian (along with Mare Winningham) of the class of 1977 of Chatsworth High School in Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California. At Chatsworth, Spacey starred in the school's senior production of \"The Sound of Music\", playing the part of Captain Georg von Trapp, with Winningham as Maria von Trapp. He started using his middle name \"Spacey\", which was his paternal grandmother's maiden name. Spacey had tried to succeed as a comedian for several years before attending the Juilliard School in New York City, as a member of Group 12, where he studied drama with teacher Marian Seldes between 1979 and 1981. During this time period, he performed comedy in bowling alley talent contests.\nCareer.\n1981\u20131989: Early roles and breakthrough.\nSpacey's first professional stage appearance was as a spear carrier in a New York Shakespeare Festival performance of \"Henry VI, Part 1\" in 1981. The following year, he made his first Broadway appearance, as Oswald in a production of Henrik Ibsen's \"Ghosts\", starring Liv Ullmann and director John Neville, which opened at the Eisenhower Theater in Washington's Kennedy Center. He then portrayed Philinte in Moli\u00e8re's \"The Misanthrope\". In 1984, Spacey appeared in a production of David Rabe's \"Hurlyburly\", in which he rotated through each of the male parts (he would later play Mickey in the film version). Next came Anton Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" alongside David Strathairn and Colleen Dewhurst. In 1986, Spacey appeared in a production of \"Sleuth\" in a New Jersey dinner theatre.\nSpacey's prominence as a stage actor began in 1986, when he was cast opposite Jack Lemmon, Peter Gallagher, and Bethel Leslie, as Jamie, the eldest Tyrone son, in Jonathan Miller's lauded production of Eugene O'Neill's \"Long Day's Journey into Night\". Lemmon in particular would become a mentor to Spacey and was invited, along with Spacey's high school drama teacher, to be present when Spacey received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999. In 1986, Spacey made his first film appearance in Mike Nichols's \"Heartburn\" starring Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson. Spacey plays a small role credited as a subway thief. In 1988, Spacey also briefly appeared in another Nichols film, \"Working Girl\", as businessman Bob Speck. Some of Spacey's other early roles include a widowed millionaire on \"L.A. Law\"; the television miniseries \"The Murder of Mary Phagan\" (1988), opposite Lemmon; and the comedy \"See No Evil, Hear No Evil\" (1989). In 1987, Spacey made his first major television appearance in the second-season premiere of \"Crime Story\", playing a Kennedy-esque American senator. That same year he appeared in spy thriller series \"The Equalizer\" as Detective Sergeant Cole in the episode \"Solo\". He earned a fan base after playing the manic depressive arms dealer Mel Profitt on the television series \"Wiseguy\" (1988).\n1990\u20131999: Stardom and acclaim.\nSpacey remained actively involved in the live theatre community. In 1991, he won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Uncle Louie in Neil Simon's Broadway hit \"Lost in Yonkers\". His father was unconvinced that Spacey could make a career for himself as an actor and did not change his mind until Spacey became well known. Spacey quickly developed a reputation as a character actor, and was cast in bigger roles, including the malevolent office manager in the ensemble film adaptation of the David Mamet play \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" (1992) starring Al Pacino, as well as news reporter Harry Kingsley in a film based on a 1917 dog sled race \"Iron Will\" (1994) directed by Charles Haid. Spacey also played one-half of a bickering Connecticut couple alongside Judy Davis in the dark comedy Christmas film \"The Ref\" (1994), and a malicious Hollywood studio boss in the satire \"Swimming with Sharks\" (1995). Spacey gained prominence for his role as the enigmatic criminal Verbal Kint in Bryan Singer's neo-noir film \"The Usual Suspects\" (1995). He starred opposite an ensemble cast including Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, and Chazz Palminteri. Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" wrote, \"Spacey is terrific as the mysterious weak link in the chain of thieves\". The role won him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Actor in a Supporting Role. That same year, Spacey also appeared in the David Fincher detective thriller \"Seven\" (1995) starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Spacey made a sudden entrance late in the film as serial killer John Doe after going uncredited and unmentioned in the film's advertisements and opening credits. His work in \"Seven\", \"The Usual Suspects\" and \"Outbreak\" earned him Best Supporting Actor honors at the 1995 Society of Texas Film Critics Awards.\nSpacey played an egomaniacal district attorney in \"A Time to Kill\" (1996) and founded Trigger Street Productions in 1997 with the purpose of producing and developing entertainment across various media. Spacey made his directorial debut with the film \"Albino Alligator\" (1996). The film was a box-office bomb, grossing $ with a budget of $, but critics praised Spacey's direction. He starred in the Curtis Hanson directed neo-noir crime film \"L.A. Confidential\" (1997) acting alongside Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and Kim Basinger. Spacey played the Detective Sergeant Jack Vincennes, an officer and technical advisor for a fictional TV police drama series. The ensemble cast received praise with Jack Matthews of \"Newsday\" citing Spacey as the highlight writing, \"Best of all are Spacey striking an impossible balance of smarminess and charm\". The role landed Spacey a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. The following year he voiced the intimidating grasshopper, Hopper in the animated Pixar film \"A Bug's Life\" (1998). Throughout his career, Spacey has been well known for playing villains; he remarked in 2013: \"I think people just like me evil for some reason. They want me to be a son of a bitch.\" Spacey hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" twice: first in 1997 with musical guest Beck and special guests Michael Palin and John Cleese from \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" and again in May 2006 with musical guest Nelly Furtado.\nIn 1999, Spacey acted alongside Annette Bening in Sam Mendes's \"American Beauty\". In the film he played the role of Lester Burnham, a depressed suburban father and advertising executive who becomes attracted to his teenage daughter's best friend. The film and its performance received widespread acclaim, particularly Spacey with critic Roger Ebert declaring, \"Spacey, an actor who embodies intelligence in his eyes and voice, is the right choice for Lester Burnham. He does reckless and foolish things in this movie, but he doesn't deceive himself; he knows he's running wild--and chooses to, burning up the future years of an empty lifetime for a few flashes of freedom\". For this role, Spacey won his second Oscar, this time for Best Actor in a Leading Role. In his acceptance speech he dedicated his Oscar to Jack Lemmon, praising him as an influence, mentor, and father figure. He also stated, \"[Lemmon's] performance in \"The Apartment\" stands as one of the finest we've ever had\". For his role he also received a BAFTA Award and Screen Actors Guild Award as well as a nomination for a Golden Globe Award. That same year, he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Also in 1999, Spacey won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor and earned another Tony Award nomination in 1999 for \"The Iceman Cometh\".\n2000\u20132009: Established actor and work at the Old Vic.\nSpacey played a physically and emotionally scarred grade school teacher in \"Pay It Forward\" (2000), a patient in a mental institution who may or may not be an alien in \"K-Pax\" (2001), and singer Bobby Darin in \"Beyond the Sea\" (2004). The latter was a lifelong dream project for Spacey, who took on co-writing, directing, co-producing and starring duties in the biography/musical about Darin's life, career and relationship with actress Sandra Dee. Facing little interest for backing in the U.S., Spacey went to the United Kingdom and Germany for funding. Almost all of the film was made in Berlin. Spacey provided his own vocals on the film's soundtrack and appeared in several tribute concerts around the time of its release. Spacey received mostly positive reviews for his singing, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. However, reviewers debated the age disparity between Spacey and Darin, noting that Spacey was too old to convincingly portray Darin, particularly during the early stages of the singer's life depicted in the film.\nIn February 2003, Spacey announced that he was to become the artistic director of the Old Vic, one of London's oldest theatres. Appearing at a press conference with Judi Dench and Elton John, Spacey promised both to appear on stage and to bring in big-name talent. He undertook to remain in the post for a full ten years. The Old Vic Theatre Company staged shows eight months out of the year. Spacey's first season started in September 2004, opening with the British premiere of the play \"Cloaca\" by Maria Goos, directed by Spacey, which opened to mixed reviews. In the 2005 season, Spacey made his UK Shakespearean debut, to good notices, in the title role of \"Richard II\", directed by Trevor Nunn.\nIn 2006, Spacey played Lex Luthor in the Bryan Singer superhero film \"Superman Returns\" starring Brandon Routh. He was to return for its 2009 sequel, but the series was instead rebooted with the 2013 film \"Man of Steel\". Spacey also appeared in \"Edison\", which received a direct-to-video release in 2006. The film was released in theaters in Netherlands on March 12, 2006. In mid-2006, Spacey was working at the Old Vic; at that point in his career, he said, he was \"trying to do things now that are much bigger and outside [myself]\". Spacey performed in productions of \"National Anthems\" by Dennis McIntyre, and \"The Philadelphia Story\" by Philip Barry, in which he played C.K. Dexter Haven, the Cary Grant role in the film version. Critics applauded Spacey for taking on the management of a theatre, but noted that while his acting was impressive, his skills and judgment as a producer/manager had yet to develop. In the 2006 season, Spacey suffered a major setback with a production of Arthur Miller's \"Resurrection Blues\", directed by Robert Altman. Despite an all-star cast (including Matthew Modine and future \"House of Cards\" co-star Neve Campbell) and the pedigree of Miller's script, Spacey's decision to lure Altman to the stage proved disastrous: after a fraught rehearsal period, the play opened to a critical panning, and closed after only a few weeks. Later in the year, Spacey starred in Eugene O'Neill's \"A Moon for the Misbegotten\", along with Colm Meaney and Eve Best. The play received excellent reviews for Spacey and Best, and was transferred to Broadway in 2007. For the spring part of the 2007\u201308 season, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Michelle Kelly joined Spacey as the three characters in David Mamet's 1988 play \"Speed-the-Plow\".\nSpacey's Capitol/EMI album \"Forever Cool\" (2007) features two duets with Spacey and an earlier recording of Dean Martin: \"Ain't That a Kick in the Head\" and \"King of the Road\". In December 2007, Spacey co-hosted the Nobel Peace Prize Concert along with Uma Thurman. In 2008 Spacey starred as Ron Klain in the HBO original political drama film \"Recount\" revolving around Florida's vote recount during the 2000 United States presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore. The film was written by Danny Strong and directed by Jay Roach and starred Bob Balaban, Laura Dern, John Hurt, Denis Leary, and Tom Wilkinson. The television film won three Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Television Movie. For his performance in the film, Spacey was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Television Film. That same year Spacey produced the TV movie \"Bernard and Doris\", an HBO semi-fictionalized account of the relationship that developed between socialite heiress and philanthropist Doris Duke and her self-destructive Irish butler Bernard Lafferty later in her life. The film starred Ralph Fiennes and Susan Sarandon and was directed by Bob Balaban. The film premiered at the Hamptons International Film Festival to critical acclaim, and Spacey was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie. Also in 2008, Spacey played a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) lecturer in the film \"21\". The film is based on Ben Mezrich's best seller \"\", a story of student MIT card-counters who used mathematical probability to aid them in card games such as blackjack. In 2009, he directed the premiere of Joe Sutton's \"Complicit\", with Richard Dreyfuss, David Suchet and Elizabeth McGovern. Later that year, Trevor Nunn directed Spacey in a revival of \"Inherit the Wind\". Spacey played defense lawyer Henry Drummond, a role that was made famous by Spencer Tracy in the 1960 film of the same name. Sam Mendes directed Spacey in Shakespeare's \"Richard III\"; Spacey played the title role. The show began in June 2011, commencing a worldwide tour culminating in New York in early 2012. In March 2014, it was announced that Spacey would star in a one-man play at the Old Vic to celebrate his ten years as artistic director. He took on the part of Clarence Darrow in the play.\n2010\u20132017: \"House of Cards\" and other roles.\nIn early 2010, Spacey went to China to star in writer-director Dayyan Eng's black comedy film \"Inseparable\", becoming the first Hollywood actor to star in a fully Chinese-funded film. In 2011, Spacey starred in J.C. Chandor's financial thriller \"Margin Call\" alongside Paul Bettany, Jeremy Irons, Zachary Quinto, Demi Moore, and Stanley Tucci. The story at large takes place over a 24-hour period at a large Wall Street investment bank during the initial stages of the 2008 financial crisis. The film, which focuses on the actions taken by a group of employees during the subsequent financial collapse, made its debut at the Sundance Film Festival to critical acclaim. Spacey received the Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award along with the cast. That same year, Spacey co-starred in the black comedy film \"Horrible Bosses\", which grossed over $ at the box office. \nOn March 18, 2011, it was announced that Spacey was cast as Frank Underwood in the Netflix series \"House of Cards\", adapted from a 1990 BBC political drama of the same name. He was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2013, becoming the first lead actor to be Primetime Emmy-nominated from a web television series. Spacey went on to win the Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Television Series Drama at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards and Screen Actors Guild nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards for his season 2 performance. He was fired from the series after the fifth season following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.\nIn 2013 he executive-produced the biographical survival thriller film \"Captain Phillips\", which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Spacey portrayed the antagonist Jonathan Irons in the 2014 video game \"\" through motion capture. He starred as President Richard Nixon in the comedy-drama \"Elvis &amp; Nixon\" (2016), which is based on the meeting that took place between Nixon and singer Elvis Presley (Michael Shannon) in December 1970 wherein Presley requested that Nixon swear him in as an undercover agent in the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. He next starred in the comedy film \"Nine Lives\", as a man trapped in the body of a cat. The film was released on August 5, 2016. Spacey is well known in Hollywood for his impressions. When he appeared on \"Inside the Actors Studio\", he imitated (at host James Lipton's request) Jack Lemmon, James Stewart, Johnny Carson, Katharine Hepburn, Clint Eastwood, John Gielgud, Marlon Brando, Christopher Walken, and Al Pacino. On \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\", Spacey admitted to using his vocal skills as a young actor in New York City to pretend to be Carson's son to obtain free theatre tickets and to enter Studio 54. \nIn January 2016 it was announced that Relativity Media, which was just emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, had acquired Trigger Street Productions and that Spacey would become chairman of Relativity Studios, while Dana Brunetti would become the studio's president. Spacey called the move \"an incredible opportunity to make great entertainment\" and said he considered it the \"next evolution in my career\". However, when the paperwork for the studio was filed for the court, it emerged that Spacey had opted out of assuming the chairmanship of the studios, and by the end of 2016 Brunetti had also left Relativity, while both remained executive producers on \"House of Cards\" and \"\".\nOn June 16, 2016, Spacey was awarded an honorary knighthood for his services to theatre, arts education, and international culture in the 2015 Queen's Birthday Honours. The honour, Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, was given at Clarence House by then-Prince Charles. As a non-Commonwealth Realm citizen, the award is honorary and he is not entitled to the honorific \"Sir\". Spacey had previously been awarded the lesser rank of honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to drama in 2010. Spacey was a patron of the Shakespeare Schools Festival, a charity that enables school children across the UK to perform Shakespeare in professional theatres. He also sits on the board of directors of the Motion Picture and Television Fund.\n2017\u2013present: Career controversy and comeback attempts.\nIn March 2017, it was announced that Spacey would portray J. Paul Getty in Ridley Scott's \"All the Money in the World\". He shot his role in the film in ten days over the summer of 2017. But because of the sexual assault allegations against Spacey, it was announced on November 8, 2017, that all of his footage would be excised, and that Christopher Plummer would replace him in reshoots. Despite the very tight schedule, TriStar Pictures completed the new version of the film in time for a December 25 release. Spacey appeared in the film \"Billionaire Boys Club\", which had a limited release on August 17, 2018. Vertical Entertainment stated that it would take no action to remove Spacey from the film, as it had been completed in late 2016, before the allegations made in October 2017. They released a statement which read in part, \"We don't condone sexual harassment on any level and we fully support victims of it. At the same time, this is neither an easy nor insensitive decision to release this film in theatres, but we believe in giving the cast, as well as hundreds of crew members who worked hard on the film, the chance to see their final product reach audiences.\" Following the allegations leveled against him, Spacey maintained a lower profile and his career stalled. \nIn May 2021, it was announced that he had been cast in a supporting role as a police detective in the crime drama film \"The Man Who Drew God\", directed by and starring Franco Nero, which is about a blind artist who is wrongly accused of sexually abusing a child. The film reunited Spacey with Faye Dunaway, whom he directed in \"Albino Alligator\". In August 2021, Spacey was reportedly filming in California for a small production, \"Peter Five Eight\", in which he plays a \"charismatic\" serial killer.\nOn November 3, 2022, \"Variety\" reported that Spacey was set to speak at the National Museum of Cinema and was going to receive a lifetime achievement award on January 16, 2023, despite the allegations against him. On November 28, 2022, after winning a sexual battery lawsuit against him filed by Anthony Rapp, Spacey was cast in the British indie thriller \"Control\". Its director, Gene Fallaize, dismissed concerns about working with Spacey. In 2022, Spacey was cast as the late Croatian leader Franjo Tu\u0111man in the political drama \"Once Upon a Time in Croatia\", directed by Jakov Sedlar. In 2024, notable industry members such as actors Sharon Stone, Liam Neeson, F. Murray Abraham, and Stephen Fry, film director Paul Schrader and theatre director Trevor Nunn vocally supported Spacey's attempts to return to acting.\nThe film \"Peter Five Eight\", released in 2024, marks Spacey's return to a major role after his legal troubles. In the same year, he starred \"The Contract\", an Italian production, with Eric Roberts.\nIn November 2025, Spacey performed a cabaret show titled \"Songs &amp; Stories\" at the Parklane Resort in Limassol, Cyprus. In an interview with \"The Daily Telegraph\" regarding the performance, Spacey stated that he was \"living in hotels\" and performing where he could find work due to his financial situation following his legal battles.\nActing credits and accolades.\nSpacey has won two Academy Awards, a Tony Award, a Golden Globe Award, four Screen Actors Guild Awards and a British Academy Film Award. He was nominated for a Grammy Award and for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards. Spacey received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999 and was named an honorary Commander and Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2010 and 2015, respectively.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPersonal life.\nSexuality and relationships.\nSpacey briefly dated American actress April Winchell after she graduated high school in the early 1980s. An article in \"The Sunday Times Magazine\" in 1999 stated that Spacey's \"love affair with acting, and the absence of a visible partner in the life of an attractive 40-year-old, has resulted in \"Esquire\" magazine asserting two years ago that he must be gay\". Spacey responded to the rumors by telling \"Playboy\" and other interviewers that he was not gay, and by telling Lesley White of \"The Sunday Times\":I chose for a long time not to answer these questions because of the manner in which they were asked, and because I was never talking to someone I trusted, so why should I? Recently I chose to participate because it's a little hard on the people I love.\nIn 1999, reports suggested that Spacey was dating a script supervisor named Dianne Dreyer, with their relationship possibly dating back to 1992. In 2000, Spacey brought Dreyer to the Academy Awards; during the acceptance speech for his Best Actor award, Spacey said, \"Dianne, thank you for teaching me about caring about the right things, and I love you.\" In 2007, \"Gotham\" magazine quoted Spacey saying:I've never believed in pimping my personal life out for publicity. Although I might be interested in doing it, I will never do it. People can gossip all they want; they can speculate all they want. I just happen to believe that there's a separation between the public life and the private life. Everybody has the right to a private life no matter what their professions are.\nIn 2017, Spacey came out as gay in a statement denying a sexual misconduct allegation. \nPolitical views and activism.\nSpacey is a Democrat and has been described as left-leaning, with his political views mirroring those of his fictional character in \"House of Cards.\" Spacey worked on Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential campaign.\nHe is a friend of former President Bill Clinton, having met Clinton before his presidency began. Spacey once described Clinton as \"one of the shining lights\" in the political process. He additionally made a cameo appearance in the short film \"President Clinton: Final Days\", a light-hearted political satire produced by the Clinton Administration for the 2000 White House Correspondents Dinner.\nSpacey has undertaken activism in the domain of HIV/AIDS. In 2002, he and fellow actor Chris Tucker accompanied Bill Clinton on a trip throughout several African countries to promote AIDS awareness on the continent. The trip gained renewed attention in 2019 amidst the sex trafficking charges against Jeffrey Epstein, whose plane was used. Spacey also participated in several fundraisers for HIV/AIDS healthcare, including amfAR Cinema Against AIDS in 2016 and the 25th Annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party in 2017.\nSpacey met Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in September 2007 but never spoke to the press about their encounter. During the trip, he visited the Venezuelan film studio Villa del Cine. In March 2011, following Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko's crackdown on the Belarusian democracy movement, Spacey joined Jude Law in a street protest in London against Lukashenko's regime.\nIn October 2008, Spacey started the Kevin Spacey Foundation in the UK to encourage youth involvement in the arts. Headquartered in England and Wales, its purpose was to provide grants to individuals and organizations to help young people study the arts, particularly theatre. The charity shut down in February 2018 following sexual misconduct allegations against Spacey.\nIn September 2006, Spacey said that he intended to take up British citizenship when it is offered to him. When asked about the UK's 2016 European Union membership referendum, Spacey replied, \"I appreciate you asking me the question, but I am not a British citizen; I am a resident of Great Britain. And I have never in my twelve years ever gotten involved in politics in Great Britain. I think it's inappropriate for me as a, really as a guest, in Great Britain, so I'll leave that to the British people.\"\nIn May 2024, Spacey endorsed Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was running as an independent, in the 2024 United States presidential election.\nIn December 2024, Spacey visited the Israel\u2013Gaza border and toured areas impacted by Hamas' 2023 October 7 attacks. He was accompanied by pro-Israel journalist Douglas Murray. Spacey was reportedly visiting the daughter of a friend, who is serving in the Israel Defence Forces.\nSexual misconduct allegations.\nIn 2017, Spacey faced several allegations of sexual assault and sexual harassment. On October 29, 2017, actor Anthony Rapp was the first to accuse Spacey of sexual misconduct. In the following weeks, other accusers came forward, including actor Roberto Cavazos, filmmaker Tony Montana, Richard Dreyfuss's son Harry, and at least eight people who worked on \"House of Cards\".\nIn the wake of these claims, Netflix cut ties with Spacey, shelving his biopic of Gore Vidal and removing him from the last season of \"House of Cards\". His completed role as J. Paul Getty in Ridley Scott's film \"All the Money in the World\" (2017) was reshot with Christopher Plummer. Spacey has denied the accusations and was found not liable in a 2022 civil lawsuit filed by Rapp in New York. In a separate criminal case in London, he was acquitted by a jury of sexual assault charges in 2023.\nIn 2024, Spacey was forced to foreclose on his house in Baltimore, Maryland due to income loss following the allegations against him.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Eric Drexler", "text": "American engineer (born 1955)\nKim Eric Drexler (born April 25, 1955) is an American engineer best known for introducing molecular nanotechnology (MNT), and his studies of its potential from the 1970s and 1980s. His 1991 doctoral thesis at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was revised and published as the book \"Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery Manufacturing and Computation\" (1992), which received the Association of American Publishers award for Best Computer Science Book of 1992. He has been called the \"godfather of nanotechnology\".\nLife and work.\nK. Eric Drexler was strongly influenced by ideas on limits to growth in the early 1970s. During his first year at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he sought out someone who was working on extraterrestrial resources. He found Gerard K. O'Neill of Princeton University, a physicist famous for his work on storage rings for particle accelerators and his landmark work on the concepts of space colonization. Drexler participated in NASA summer studies on space colonies in 1975 and 1976. He fabricated metal thin films a few tens of nanometers thick on a wax support to demonstrate the potentials of high-performance solar sails. He was active in space politics, helping the L5 Society defeat the Moon Treaty in 1980. Besides working summers for O'Neill, building mass driver prototypes, Drexler delivered papers at the first three Space Manufacturing conferences at Princeton. The 1977 and 1979 papers were co-authored with Keith Henson, and patents were issued on both subjects, vapor phase fabrication and space radiators.\nDuring the late 1970s, Drexler began to develop ideas about molecular nanotechnology (MNT). In 1979, he encountered Richard Feynman's provocative 1959 talk \"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom\". In 1981, Drexler wrote a seminal research article, published by PNAS, \"Molecular engineering: An approach to the development of general capabilities for molecular manipulation\". This article has continued to be cited, more than 620 times, during the following 35 years.\nThe term \"nano-technology\" had been coined by the Tokyo University of Science professor Norio Taniguchi in 1974 to describe the precision manufacture of materials with nanometer tolerances, and Drexler unknowingly used a related term in his 1986 book \"Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology\" to describe what later became known as molecular nanotechnology (MNT). In that book, he proposed the idea of a nanoscale \"assembler\" which would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity. He also first published the term \"grey goo\" to describe what might happen if a hypothetical self-replicating molecular assembler went out of control. He has subsequently tried to clarify his concerns about out-of-control self-replicators, and make the case that molecular manufacturing does not require such devices.\nEducation.\nDrexler holds three degrees from MIT. He received his B.S. in Interdisciplinary Sciences in 1977 and his M.S. in 1979 in Astro/Aerospace Engineering with a master's thesis titled \"Design of a High Performance Solar Sail System\". In 1991, he earned a Ph.D. through the MIT Media Lab (formally, the Media Arts and Sciences Section, School of Architecture and Planning) after the department of electrical engineering and computer science refused to approve Drexler's plan of study.\nHis Ph.D. work was the first doctoral degree on the topic of molecular nanotechnology and his thesis, \"Molecular Machinery and Manufacturing with Applications to Computation\", was published (with minor editing) as \"Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing and Computation\" (1992), which received the Association of American Publishers award for Best Computer Science Book of 1992.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1981, Drexler married Christine Peterson. The marriage ended in 2002.\nIn 2006, Drexler married Rosa Wang, a former investment banker who works with Ashoka: Innovators for the Public on improving the social capital markets.\nDrexler has arranged to be cryonically preserved in the event of legal death.\nReception.\nDrexler's work on nanotechnology was criticized as naive by Nobel Prize winner Richard Smalley in a 2001 \"Scientific American\" article. Smalley first argued that \"fat fingers\" made MNT impossible. He later argued that nanomachines would have to resemble chemical enzymes more than Drexler's assemblers and could only work in water. Drexler maintained that both were straw man arguments, and in the case of enzymes, wrote that \"Prof. Klibanov wrote in 1994, ' ... using an enzyme in organic solvents eliminates several obstacles\u00a0... '\" Drexler had difficulty in getting Smalley to respond, but in December 2003, Chemical and Engineering news carried a four-part debate. Ray Kurzweil disputes Smalley's arguments.\nThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, in its 2006 review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative, argues that it is difficult to predict the future capabilities of nanotechnology:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn science fiction.\nDrexler and his work on nanotechnology have been referenced in various media, particularly in science fiction literature. In Neal Stephenson's science fiction novel \"The Diamond Age\", he is portrayed as one of the heroes of a future world shaped by nanotechnology. In the science fiction novel \"Newton's Wake\" by Ken MacLeod, a 'drexler' is a nanotech assembler of pretty much anything that can fit in the volume of the particular machine\u2014from socks to starships. Drexler is also mentioned in the science fiction book \"Decipher\" by Stel Pavlou; his book is mentioned as one of the starting points of nanomachine construction, as well as giving a better understanding of the way carbon 60 was to be applied. James Rollins references Drexler's \"Engines of Creation\" in his novel \"Excavation\", using his theory of a molecular machine in two sections as a possible explanation for the mysterious \"Substance Z\" in the story. He is also mentioned in Timothy Leary's \"Design for Dying,\" and in Michael Crichton's 2002 novel \"Prey\".\nDrexler was mentioned in DC Comics' \"Doom Patrol\" in 1992. The Drexler Facility (\"\u30c9\u30ec\u30af\u30b5\u30fc\u6a5f\u95a2\") of molecular nanotechnology research in the Japanese eroge visual novels \"Baldr Sky\" is named after him. The \"Assemblers\" are its key invention.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

North Korea was supported by China and the Soviet Union, while South Korea was supported by the United Nations Command (UNC) led by the United States. The conflict was one of the first major proxy wars of the Cold War.\nAfter the end of World War II in 1945, Korea, which had been a Japanese colony for 35 years, was divided by the Soviet Union and the United States into two occupation zones at the 38th parallel, with plans for a future independent state. Due to political disagreements the zones formed their own governments in 1948. North Korea was led by Kim Il Sung in Pyongyang, and South Korea by Syngman Rhee in Seoul; both claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea. On 25 June 1950, the Korean People's Army (KPA), equipped and trained by the Soviets, launched an invasion of the south. In the absence of the Soviet Union's representative, the UN Security Council denounced the attack and recommended member states to repel the invasion. UN forces comprised 21 countries, with the United States providing around 90% of military personnel.\nSeoul was captured by the KPA on 28 June, and by early August, the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) and its allies were nearly defeated, holding onto only the Pusan Perimeter in the peninsula's southeast. On 15 September, UN forces landed at Inchon near Seoul, cutting off KPA troops and supply lines. UN forces broke out from the perimeter on 18 September, re-captured Seoul, and invaded North Korea in October, capturing Pyongyang and advancing towards the Yalu River\u2014the border with China. On 19 October, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) crossed the Yalu and entered the war on the side of the North. UN forces retreated from North Korea in December, following the PVA's first and second offensive. Communist forces captured Seoul again in January 1951 before losing it to a UN counter-offensive two months later. After an abortive Chinese spring offensive, UN forces retook territory roughly up to the 38th parallel. Armistice negotiations began in July 1951, but dragged on as the fighting became a war of attrition and the North suffered heavy damage from U.N. bombing.\nCombat ended on 27 July 1953 with the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, which allowed the exchange of prisoners and created a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) along the frontline, with a Joint Security Area at Panmunjom. The conflict caused more than one million military deaths and an estimated two to three million civilian deaths. Alleged war crimes include the mass killing of suspected communists by Seoul and the mass killing of alleged reactionaries by Pyongyang. North Korea became one of the most heavily bombed countries in history, and virtually all of Korea's major cities were destroyed. No peace treaty has been signed, making the war a frozen conflict.\nNames.\nIn South Korea, the war is usually referred to as the \"625 War\" (; ), the \"625 Upheaval\" (; ; ), or simply \"625\", reflecting the date of its commencement on 25 June.\nIn North Korea, the war is officially referred to as the \"Fatherland Liberation War\" () or the \"Chos\u014fn\" [Korean] \"War\" (; ).\nIn mainland China, the segment of the war after the intervention of the People's Volunteer Army is commonly and officially known as the \"Great Movement to Resist America and Assist Korea\" (), while the segment preceding that is officially called the \"Korean Civil War\" (). The term \"\"Chos\u014fn\" War\" () is sometimes used unofficially. The term \"\"H\u00e1n\" (Korean) War\" () is most used in Taiwan (Republic of China), Hong Kong and Macau.\nIn the US, the war was initially described by President Harry S. Truman as a \"police action\" as the US never formally declared war and the operation was conducted under the auspices of the UN. It has sometimes been referred to in the English-speaking world as \"The Forgotten War\" or \"The Unknown War\" because of the lack of public attention it received relative to World War II and the Vietnam War.\nBackground.\nImperial Japanese rule (1910\u20131945).\nThe Empire of Japan diminished the influence of China over Korea in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u201395). A decade later, after defeating Imperial Russia in the Russo-Japanese War, Japan made the Korean Empire its protectorate with the Eulsa Treaty in 1905, then annexed it with the Japan\u2013Korea Treaty of 1910.\nMany Korean nationalists fled the country. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was founded in 1919 in Nationalist China. It failed to achieve international recognition, failed to unite the nationalist groups, and had a fractious relationship with its US-based founding president, Syngman Rhee.\nIn China, the nationalist National Revolutionary Army and the communist People's Liberation Army (PLA) helped organize Korean refugees against the Japanese military, which had also occupied parts of China. The Nationalist-backed Koreans, led by Yi Pom-Sok, fought in the Burma campaign (1941\u201345). The communists, led by, among others, Kim Il Sung, fought the Japanese in Korea and Manchuria. At the Cairo Conference in 1943, China, the UK, and the US decided that \"in due course, Korea shall become free and independent\".\nKorea divided (1945\u20131949).\nAt the Tehran Conference in 1943 and the Yalta Conference in February 1945, the Soviet Union promised to join its allies in the Pacific War within three months of the victory in Europe. The USSR declared war on Japan and invaded Manchuria on 8 August 1945. On 10 August, Soviet forces entered northern Korea and secured most major cities in the north by 24 August.82 Japanese resistance was light.82 Having fought Japan on Korean soil, the Soviet forces were well received by Koreans.82\nOn 10 August in Washington, US Colonels Dean Rusk and Charles H. Bonesteel III were assigned to divide Korea into Soviet and US occupation zones and proposed the 38th parallel as the dividing line. This was incorporated into the US General Order No. 1, which responded to the Japanese surrender on 15 August. Explaining the choice of the 38th parallel, Rusk observed, \"Even though it was further north than could be realistically reached by U. S. [\"sic\"] forces in the event of Soviet disagreement\u00a0... we felt it important to include the capital of Korea in the area of responsibility of American troops\". Joseph Stalin, however, maintained his wartime policy of cooperation, and on 16 August, the Red Army halted at the 38th parallel for three weeks to await the arrival of US forces.\nOn 7 September 1945, General Douglas MacArthur issued Proclamation No. 1 to the people of Korea, announcing US military control over Korea south of the 38th parallel and establishing English as the official language during military control. On 8 September, US Lieutenant General John R. Hodge arrived in Incheon to accept the Japanese surrender south of the 38th parallel. Appointed as military governor, Hodge directly controlled South Korea as head of the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK 1945\u201348).\nIn December 1945, Korea was administered by the US\u2013Soviet Union Joint Commission, as agreed at the Moscow Conference, to grant independence after a five-year trusteeship. Waiting five years for independence was unpopular among Koreans, and riots broke out. The Communist Party supported the trusteeship, while Kim Ku and Syngman Rhee led the anti-trusteeship movement against both the U.S. military government and the Soviet military administration. To contain them, the USAMGIK banned strikes on 8 December and outlawed the PRK Revolutionary Government and People's Committees on 12 December. Following further civilian unrest, the USAMGIK declared martial law.\nCiting the inability of the Joint Commission to make progress, the UN decided to hold an election under UN auspices to create an independent Korea, as stated in UN General Assembly Resolution 112. The Soviet authorities and Korean communists refused to participate in the election. The final attempt to establish a unified government was thwarted by North Korea's refusal. Due to concerns about division caused by an election without North Korea's participation, many South Korean politicians boycotted it. The 1948 South Korean general election was held in May. The resultant South Korean government promulgated a national political constitution on 17 July and elected Syngman Rhee as president on 20 July. The Republic of Korea (South Korea) was established on 15 August 1948.\nIn the Soviet-Korean Zone of Occupation, the Soviets agreed to the establishment of a communist government led by Kim Il Sung. The 1948 North Korean parliamentary elections took place in August. The Soviet Union withdrew its forces in 1948 and the US in 1949.\nChinese Civil War (1945\u20131949).\nWith the end of the war with Japan, the Chinese Civil War resumed in earnest between the Communists and the Nationalist-led government. While the Communists were struggling for supremacy in Manchuria, they were supported by the North Korean government with mat\u00e9riel and manpower. According to Chinese sources, the North Koreans donated 2,000 railway cars worth of supplies while thousands of Koreans served in the Chinese PLA during the war. North Korea also provided the Chinese Communists in Manchuria with a safe refuge for non-combatants and communications with the rest of China. As a token of gratitude, between 50,000 and 70,000 Korean veterans who served in the PLA were sent back along with their weapons, and they later played a significant role in the initial invasion of South Korea. China promised to support the North Koreans in the event of a war against South Korea.\nCommunist insurgency in South Korea (1948\u20131950).\nBy 1948, a North Korea-backed insurgency had broken out in the southern half of the peninsula. This was exacerbated by the undeclared border war between the Koreas, which saw division-level engagements and thousands of deaths on both sides. The ROK was almost entirely trained and focused on counterinsurgency, rather than conventional warfare. They were equipped and advised by a force of a few hundred American officers, who were successful in helping the ROKA to subdue guerrillas and hold its own against North Korean military (Korean People's Army, KPA) forces along the 38th parallel. Approximately 8,000 South Korean soldiers and police officers died in the insurgent war and border clashes.\nThe first socialist uprising occurred without direct North Korean participation, though the guerrillas still professed support for the northern government. Beginning in April 1948 on Jeju Island, the campaign saw arrests and repression by the South Korean government in the fight against the South Korean Labor Party, resulting in 30,000 violent deaths, among them 14,373 civilians, of whom ~2,000 were killed by rebels and ~12,000 by ROK security forces. The Yeosu\u2013Suncheon rebellion overlapped with it, as several thousand army defectors waving red flags massacred right-leaning families. This resulted in another brutal suppression by the government and between 2,976 and 3,392 deaths. By May 1948, both uprisings had been crushed.\nInsurgency reignited in the spring of 1949 when attacks by guerrillas in the mountainous regions (buttressed by army defectors and North Korean agents) increased. Insurgent activity peaked in late 1949 as the ROKA engaged so-called People's Guerrilla Units. Organized and armed by the North Korean government, and backed by 2,400 KPA commandos who had infiltrated through the border, these guerrillas launched an offensive in September aimed at undermining the South Korean government and preparing the country for the KPA's arrival in force. This offensive failed. However, the guerrillas were now entrenched in the Taebaek-san region of the North Gyeongsang Province and the border areas of the Gangwon Province.\nWhile the insurgency was ongoing, the ROKA and KPA engaged in battalion-sized battles along the border, starting in May 1949. Border clashes between South and North continued on 4 August 1949, when thousands of North Korean troops attacked South Korean troops occupying territory north of the 38th parallel. The 2nd and 18th ROK Infantry Regiments repulsed attacks in Kuksa-bong, and KPA troops were \"completely routed\". Border incidents decreased by the start of 1950.\nMeanwhile, counterinsurgencies in the South Korean interior intensified; persistent operations, paired with worsening weather, denied the guerrillas sanctuary and wore away their fighting strength. North Korea responded by sending more troops to link up with insurgents and build more partisan cadres; North Korean infiltrators had reached 3,000 soldiers in 12 units by the start of 1950, but all were destroyed or scattered by the ROKA.\nOn 1 October 1949, the ROKA launched a three-pronged assault on the insurgents in South Cholla and Taegu. By March 1950, the ROKA claimed 5,621 guerrillas killed or captured and 1,066 small arms seized. This operation crippled the insurgency. Soon after, North Korea made final attempts to keep the uprising active, sending battalion-sized units of infiltrators under the commands of Kim Sang-ho and Kim Moo-hyon. The first battalion was reduced to a single man over the course of engagements by the ROKA 8th Division. The second was annihilated by a two-battalion hammer-and-anvil maneuver by units of the ROKA 6th Division, resulting in a toll of 584 KPA guerrillas (480 killed, 104 captured) and 69 ROKA troops killed, plus 184 wounded. By the spring of 1950, guerrilla activity had mostly subsided; the border, too, was calm.\nPrelude to war (1950).\nBy 1949, South Korean and US military actions had reduced indigenous communist guerrillas in the South from 5,000 to 1,000. However, Kim Il Sung believed widespread uprisings had weakened the South Korean military and that a North Korean invasion would be welcomed by much of the South Korean population. Kim began seeking Stalin's support for an invasion in March 1949, traveling to Moscow to persuade him.\nStalin initially did not think the time was right for a war in Korea. PLA forces were still embroiled in the Chinese Civil War, while US forces remained stationed in South Korea. By spring 1950, he believed that the strategic situation had changed: PLA forces under Mao Zedong had secured final victory, US forces had withdrawn from Korea, and the Soviets had detonated their first nuclear bomb, breaking the US monopoly. As the US had not directly intervened to stop the communists in China, Stalin calculated they would be even less willing to fight in Korea, which had less strategic significance. The Soviets had cracked the codes used by the US to communicate with their embassy in Moscow, and reading dispatches convinced Stalin that Korea did not have the importance to the US that would warrant a nuclear confrontation. Stalin began a more aggressive strategy in Asia based on these developments, including promising economic and military aid to China through the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.\nIn April 1950, Stalin permitted Kim to attack the government in the South, under the condition that Mao would agree to send reinforcements if needed. For Kim, this was the fulfillment of his goal to unite Korea. Stalin made it clear Soviet forces would not openly engage in combat, to avoid a direct war with the United States.\nKim met with Mao in May 1950 and differing historical interpretations of the meeting have been put forward. According to Barbara Barnouin and Yu Changgeng, Mao agreed to support Kim despite concerns of American intervention, as China desperately needed the economic and military aid promised by the Soviets. Kathryn Weathersby cites Soviet documents which said Kim secured Mao's support. Along with Mark O'Neill, she says this accelerated Kim's war preparations. Chen Jian argues Mao never seriously challenged Kim's plans and Kim had every reason to inform Stalin that he had obtained Mao's support. Citing more recent scholarship, Zhao Suisheng contends Mao did not approve of Kim's war proposal and requested verification from Stalin, who did so via a telegram. Mao accepted the decision made by Kim and Stalin to unify Korea but cautioned Kim over possible US intervention.\nSoviet generals with extensive combat experience from World War II were sent to North Korea as the Soviet Advisory Group. They completed plans for attack by May and called for a skirmish to be initiated in the Ongjin Peninsula on the west coast of Korea. The North Koreans would then launch an attack to capture Seoul and encircle and destroy the ROK. The final stage would involve destroying South Korean government remnants and capturing the rest of South Korea, including the ports.\nOn 7 June 1950, Kim called for a Korea-wide election on 5\u20138 August 1950 and a consultative conference in Haeju on 15\u201317 June. On 11 June, the North sent three diplomats to the South as a peace overture, which Rhee rejected outright. On 21 June, Kim revised his war plan to involve a general attack across the 38th parallel, rather than a limited operation in Ongjin. Kim was concerned that South Korean agents had learned about the plans and that South Korean forces were strengthening their defenses. Stalin agreed to this change.\nWhile these preparations were underway in the North, there were clashes along the 38th parallel, especially at Kaesong and Ongjin, many initiated by the South. The ROK was being trained by the US Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG). On the eve of the war, KMAG commander General William Lynn Roberts voiced utmost confidence in the ROK and boasted that any North Korean invasion would merely provide \"target practice\". For his part, Syngman Rhee repeatedly expressed his desire to conquer the North, including when US diplomat John Foster Dulles visited Korea on 18 June.\nThough some South Korean and US intelligence officers predicted an attack, similar predictions had been made before and nothing had happened. The Central Intelligence Agency noted the southward movement by the KPA but assessed this as a \"defensive measure\" and concluded an invasion was \"unlikely\". On 23 June UN observers inspected the border and did not detect that war was imminent.\nComparison of forces.\nChinese involvement was extensive from the beginning, building on previous collaboration between the Chinese and Korean communists during the Chinese Civil War. Throughout 1949 and 1950, the Soviets continued arming North Korea. After the communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, ethnic Korean units in the PLA were sent to North Korea.\nIn the fall of 1949, two PLA divisions composed mainly of Korean-Chinese troops (the 164th and 166th) entered North Korea, followed by smaller units throughout the rest of 1949. The reinforcement of the KPA with PLA veterans continued into 1950, with the 156th Division and several other units of the former Fourth Field Army arriving in February; the PLA 156th Division was reorganized as the KPA 7th Division. By mid-1950, between 50,000 and 70,000 former PLA troops had entered North Korea, forming a significant part of the KPA's strength on the eve of the war's beginning. The combat veterans and equipment from China, the tanks, artillery, and aircraft supplied by the Soviets, and rigorous training increased North Korea's military superiority over the South, armed by the U.S. military with mostly small arms, but no heavy weaponry.\nSeveral generals, such as Lee Kwon-mu, were PLA veterans born to ethnic Koreans in China. While older histories of the conflict often referred to these ethnic Korean PLA veterans as being sent from northern Korea to fight in the Chinese Civil War before being sent back, recent Chinese archival sources studied by Kim Donggill indicate that this was not the case. Rather, the soldiers were indigenous to China, as part of China's longstanding ethnic Korean community, and were recruited to the PLA in the same way as any other Chinese citizen.\nAccording to the first official census in 1949, the population of North Korea numbered 9,620,000, and by mid-1950, North Korean forces numbered between 150,000 and 200,000 troops, organized into 10 infantry divisions, one tank division, and one air force division, with 210 fighter planes and 280 tanks, who captured scheduled objectives and territory, among them Kaesong, Chuncheon, Uijeongbu, and Ongjin. Their forces included 274 T-34-85 tanks, 200 artillery pieces, 110 attack bombers, 150 Yak fighter planes, and 35 reconnaissance aircraft. In addition to the invasion force, the North had 114 fighters, 78 bombers, 105 T-34-85 tanks, and some 30,000 soldiers stationed in reserve in North Korea. Although each navy consisted of only several small warships, the North and South Korean navies fought in the war as seaborne artillery for their armies.\nIn contrast, the South Korean population was estimated at 20\u00a0million, over twice that of the North, but its army was unprepared and ill-equipped. As of 25 June 1950, the ROK had 98,000 soldiers (65,000 combat, 33,000 support), no tanks (they had been requested from the U.S. military, but requests were denied), and a 22-plane air force comprising 12 liaison-type and 10 AT-6 advanced-trainer airplanes. Large U.S. garrisons and air forces were in Japan, but only 200\u2013300 U.S. troops were in Korea.\nCourse of the war.\nOperation Pokpung.\nAt dawn on 25 June 1950, the KPA crossed the 38th parallel behind artillery fire. It justified its assault with the claim ROK troops attacked first and that the KPA were aiming to arrest and execute the \"bandit traitor Syngman Rhee\". Fighting began on the strategic Ongjin Peninsula in the west. There were initial South Korean claims that the 17th Regiment had counterattacked at Haeju; some scholars argue the claimed counterattack was instead the instigating attack, and therefore that the South Koreans may have fired first. However, the report that contained the Haeju claim contained errors and outright falsehoods.\nKPA forces attacked all along the 38th parallel within an hour. The KPA had a combined arms force including tanks supported by heavy artillery. The ROK had no tanks, anti-tank weapons, or heavy artillery. The South Koreans committed their forces in a piecemeal fashion, and these were routed in a few days.\nOn 27 June, Rhee evacuated Seoul with some of the government. At 02:00 on 28 June the ROK blew up the Hangang Bridge across the Han River in an attempt to stop the KPA. The bridge was detonated while 4,000 refugees were crossing it, and hundreds were killed. Destroying the bridge trapped many ROK units north of the river. In spite of such desperate measures, Seoul fell that same day. Some South Korean National Assemblymen remained in Seoul when it fell, and 48 subsequently pledged allegiance to the North.\nOn 28 June, Rhee ordered the massacre of suspected political opponents in his own country. In five days, the ROK, which had 95,000 troops on 25 June, was down to less than 22,000 troops. In early July, when US forces arrived, what was left of the ROK was placed under US operational command of the United Nations Command.\nFactors in U.S. intervention.\nThe Truman administration was unprepared for the invasion. Korea was not included in the strategic Asian Defense Perimeter outlined by United States Secretary of State Dean Acheson. Military strategists were more concerned with the security of Europe against the Soviet Union than that of East Asia. The administration was worried a war in Korea could quickly escalate without American intervention. Diplomat John Foster Dulles stated: \"To sit by while Korea is overrun by unprovoked armed attack would start a disastrous chain of events leading most probably to world war.\"\nWhile there was hesitance by some in the US government to get involved, considerations about Japan fed into the decision to engage on behalf of South Korea. After the fall of China to the communists, US experts saw Japan as the region's counterweight to the Soviet Union and China. While there was no US policy dealing with South Korea directly as a national interest, its proximity to Japan increased its importance. Said Kim: \"The recognition that the security of Japan required a non-hostile Korea led directly to President Truman's decision to intervene\u00a0... The essential point\u00a0... is that the American response to the North Korean attack stemmed from considerations of U.S. policy toward Japan.\"\nAnother consideration was the Soviet reaction if the US intervened. The Truman administration was fearful the Korean War was a diversionary assault that would escalate to a general war in Europe once the US committed in Korea. At the same time, \"[t]here was no suggestion from anyone that the United Nations or the United States could back away from [the conflict]\". Yugoslavia\u2014a possible Soviet target because of the Tito-Stalin split\u2014was vital to the defense of Italy and Greece, and the country was first on the list of the National Security Council's post-North Korea invasion list of \"chief danger spots\". Truman believed if aggression went unchecked, a chain reaction would start that would marginalize the UN and encourage communist aggression elsewhere. The UN Security Council approved the use of force to help the South Koreans.\nThe Truman administration was uncertain whether the attack was a ploy by the Soviet Union, or just a test of US resolve. The decision to commit ground troops became viable when a communiqu\u00e9 was received on 27 June indicating the Soviet Union would not move against US forces in Korea. The Truman administration believed it could intervene in Korea without undermining its commitments elsewhere.\nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions.\nOn 25 June 1950, the United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned the North Korean invasion of South Korea with Resolution 82. The Soviet Union, a veto-wielding power, had boycotted Council meetings since January 1950, protesting Taiwan's occupation of China's permanent seat. The Security Council, on 27 June 1950, published Resolution 83 recommending member states provide military assistance to the Republic of Korea. On 27 June President Truman ordered U.S. air and sea forces to help. On 4 July the Soviet deputy foreign minister accused the U.S. of starting armed intervention on behalf of South Korea.\nThe Soviet Union challenged the legitimacy of the war for several reasons. The ROK intelligence upon which Resolution 83 was based came from US Intelligence; North Korea was not invited as a sitting temporary member of the UN, which violated UN Charter Article 32; and the fighting was beyond the Charter's scope, because the initial North\u2013South border fighting was classed as a civil war. Because the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council, some legal scholars posited that deciding upon this type of action required the unanimous vote of all five permanent members.\nWithin days of the invasion, masses of ROK soldiers\u2014of dubious loyalty to the Syngman Rhee regime\u2014were retreating southwards or defecting en masse to the northern side, the KPA.\nOn 7 July the UNSC set up under the sponsorship of the British and French sides a Unified Command structure which was authorized to fly the blue flag of the UN but was not subject in any way to United Nations orders.\nUnited States' response (July\u2013August 1950).\nAs soon as word of the attack was received, Acheson informed Truman that the North Koreans had invaded South Korea. Truman and Acheson discussed a US invasion response and agreed the US was obligated to act, comparing the North Korean invasion with Adolf Hitler's aggressions in the 1930s, and the mistake of appeasement must not be repeated. US industries were mobilized to supply materials, labor, capital, production facilities, and other services necessary to support the military objectives of the Korean War. Truman later explained he believed fighting the invasion was essential to the containment of communism as outlined in the National Security Council Report 68 (NSC 68):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn August 1950, Truman and Acheson obtained the consent of Congress to appropriate $12\u00a0billion for military action, equivalent to $\u00a0billion in 2024. Because of the extensive defense cuts and emphasis on building a nuclear bomber force, none of the services were able to make a robust response with conventional military strength. General Omar Bradley, Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was faced with deploying a force that was a shadow of its World War II counterpart.\nActing on Acheson's recommendation, Truman ordered MacArthur, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan, to transfer mat\u00e9riel to the South Korean military, while giving air cover to evacuation of US nationals. Truman disagreed with advisers who recommended unilateral bombing of the North Korean forces and ordered the U.S. Seventh Fleet to protect Taiwan, whose government asked to fight in Korea. The US denied Taiwan's request for combat, lest it provokes retaliation from the PRC. Because the US had sent the Seventh Fleet to \"neutralize\" the Taiwan Strait, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai criticized the UN and US initiatives as \"armed aggression on Chinese territory\". The US supported the Kuomintang in Burma in the hope these KMT forces would harass China from the southwest, thereby diverting Chinese resources from Korea.65\nThe drive south and Pusan (July\u2013September 1950).\nThe Battle of Osan, the first significant US engagement, involved the 540-soldier Task Force Smith, a small forward element of the 24th Infantry Division flown in from Japan. On 5 July 1950, Task Force Smith attacked the KPA at Osan but without weapons capable of destroying KPA tanks. The KPA defeated the US, with 180 American casualties. The KPA progressed southwards, pushing back US forces at Pyongtaek, Chonan, and Chochiwon, forcing the 24th Division's retreat to Taejeon, which the KPA captured in the Battle of Taejon. The 24th Division suffered 3,602 dead and wounded and 2,962 captured, including its commander, Major General William F. Dean.\nBy August, the KPA steadily pushed back the ROK and the Eighth United States Army southwards. The impact of the Truman administration's defense budget cutbacks was keenly felt, as US troops fought costly rearguard actions. Facing a veteran and well-led KPA force, and lacking sufficient anti-tank weapons, artillery or armor, the Americans retreated and the KPA advanced down the Peninsula. By September, UN forces were hemmed into a corner of southeast Korea, near Pusan. This perimeter enclosed about 10% of Korea, in a line defined by the Nakdong River.\nThe KPA purged South Korea's intelligentsia by killing civil servants and intellectuals. On 20 August, MacArthur warned Kim Il Sung he would be held responsible for KPA atrocities.\nKim's early successes led him to predict the war would finish by the end of August. Chinese leaders were more pessimistic. To counter a possible US deployment, Zhou secured a Soviet commitment to have the Soviet Union support Chinese forces with air cover, and he deployed 260,000 soldiers along the Korean border, under the command of Gao Gang. Zhou authorized a topographical survey of Korea and directed Lei Yingfu, Zhou's military adviser in Korea, to analyze the military situation. Lei concluded MacArthur would likely attempt a landing at Incheon. After conferring with Mao that this would be MacArthur's most likely strategy, Zhou briefed Soviet and North Korean advisers of Lei's findings, and issued orders to PLA commanders to prepare for US naval activity in the Korea Strait.\nIn the resulting Battle of Pusan Perimeter, UN forces withstood KPA attacks meant to capture the city at the Naktong Bulge, P'ohang-dong, and Taegu. The United States Air Force (USAF) interrupted KPA logistics with 40 daily ground support sorties, which destroyed 32 bridges, halting daytime road and rail traffic. KPA forces were forced to hide in tunnels by day and move only at night. To deny military equipment and supplies to the KPA, the USAF destroyed logistics depots, refineries, and harbors, while U.S. Navy aircraft attacked transport hubs. Consequently, the overextended KPA could not be supplied throughout the south. On 27 August, aircraft from the 67th Fighter Squadron mistakenly attacked facilities in Chinese territory, and the Soviet Union called the Security Council's attention to China's complaint about the incident. The US proposed that a commission composed of India and Sweden determine what the US should pay in compensation, but this was vetoed by the Soviet Union.\nMeanwhile, US garrisons in Japan continually dispatched soldiers and military supplies to reinforce defenders in the Pusan Perimeter. MacArthur went so far as to call for Japan's rearmament. Tank battalions deployed to Korea, from the port of San Francisco to the port of Pusan, the largest Korean port. By late August, the Pusan Perimeter had 500 medium tanks battle-ready. In early September 1950, UN forces outnumbered the KPA 180,000 to 100,000 soldiers.\nBattle of Incheon (September 1950).\nAgainst the rested and rearmed Pusan Perimeter defenders and their reinforcements, the KPA were undermanned and poorly supplied; unlike the UN, they lacked naval and air support. To relieve the Pusan Perimeter, MacArthur recommended an amphibious landing at Incheon, near Seoul, well over behind the KPA lines. On 6 July, he ordered Major General Hobart R. Gay, commander of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, to plan an amphibious landing at Incheon; on 12\u201314 July, the 1st Cavalry Division embarked from Yokohama, Japan, to reinforce the 24th Infantry Division inside the Pusan Perimeter.\nSoon after the war began, MacArthur began planning an Incheon landing, but the Pentagon opposed him. When authorized, he activated a combined US Army and Marine Corps, and ROK force. The X Corps, consisted of 40,000 troops of the 1st Marine Division, the 7th Infantry Division and around 8,600 ROK soldiers. By 15 September, the amphibious force faced few KPA defenders at Incheon: military intelligence, psychological warfare, guerrilla reconnaissance, and protracted bombardment facilitated a light battle. However, the bombardment destroyed most of Incheon.\nBreakout from the Pusan Perimeter.\nOn 16 September Eighth Army began its breakout from the Pusan Perimeter. Task Force Lynch, 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, and 70th Tank Battalion units advanced through of KPA territory to join the 7th Infantry Division at Osan on 27 September. X Corps rapidly defeated the KPA defenders around Seoul, thus threatening to trap the main KPA force.\nOn 18 September, Stalin dispatched General H. M. Zakharov to advise Kim to halt his offensive around the Pusan Perimeter, and redeploy his forces to defend Seoul. Chinese commanders were not briefed on North Korean troop numbers or operational plans. Zhou suggested the North Koreans should attempt to eliminate the UN forces at Incheon only if they had reserves of at least 100,000 men; otherwise, he advised the North Koreans to withdraw their forces north.\nOn 25 September, Seoul was recaptured by UN forces. US air raids caused heavy damage to the KPA, destroying most of its tanks and artillery. KPA troops in the south, instead of effectively withdrawing north, rapidly disintegrated, leaving Pyongyang vulnerable. During the retreat, only 25,000-30,000 KPA soldiers managed to reach the KPA lines. On 27 September, Stalin convened an emergency session of the Politburo, where he condemned the incompetence of the KPA command and held Soviet military advisers responsible for the defeat.\nUN forces invade North Korea (September\u2013October 1950).\nOn 27 September, MacArthur received secret National Security Council Memorandum 81/1 from Truman reminding him operations north of the 38th parallel was authorized only if \"at the time of such operation there was no entry into North Korea by major Soviet or Chinese Communist forces, no announcements of intended entry, nor a threat to counter our operations militarily\". On 29 September, MacArthur restored the government of the Republic of Korea under Syngman Rhee. The Joint Chiefs of Staff on 27 September sent MacArthur a comprehensive directive: it stated the primary goal was the destruction of the KPA, with the unification of the Peninsula under Rhee as a secondary objective \"if possible\"; the Joint Chiefs added this objective was dependent on whether the Chinese and Soviets would intervene, and was subject to changing conditions.\nOn 30 September, Zhou warned the US that China was prepared to intervene if the US crossed the 38th parallel. Zhou attempted to advise KPA commanders on how to conduct a general withdrawal by using the same tactics that allowed Chinese Communist forces to escape Nationalist encirclement campaigns in the 1930s, but KPA commanders did not use these tactics effectively. Bruce Cumings argues, however, that the KPA's rapid withdrawal was strategic, with troops melting into the mountains from where they could launch guerrilla raids on the UN forces spread out on the coasts.\nBy 1 October, the UN Command had driven the KPA past the 38th parallel, and RoK forces pursued the KPA northwards. MacArthur demanded the KPA's unconditional surrender. On 7 October, with UN authorization, the UN Command forces followed the ROK forces northwards. The US Eighth Army drove up western Korea and captured Pyongyang on 19 October. On 20 October, the US 187th Airborne Regiment made their first of their two combat jumps during the war at Sunchon and Sukchon. The mission was to cut the road north to China, prevent North Korean leaders from escaping Pyongyang, and rescue US prisoners of war.\nAt month's end, UN forces held 135,000 KPA prisoners of war. As they neared the Sino-Korean border, the UN forces in the west were divided from those in the east by of mountainous terrain. In addition to the 135,000 captured, the KPA had suffered some 200,000 soldiers killed or wounded, for a total of 335,000 casualties since the end of June 1950, and lost 313 tanks. A mere 25,000 KPA regulars retreated across the 38th parallel, as their military had collapsed. The UN forces on the peninsula numbered 229,722 combat troops (including 125,126 Americans and 82,786 South Koreans), 119,559 rear area troops, and 36,667 US Air Force personnel. MacArthur believed it necessary to extend the war into China to destroy depots supplying the North Korean effort. Truman disagreed and ordered caution at the Sino-Korean border.\nChina intervenes (October\u2013December 1950).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOn 3 October 1950, China attempted to warn the US, through its embassy in India, it would intervene if UN forces crossed the 38th parallel.42169 The US did not respond as policymakers in Washington, including Truman, considered it a bluff.4216957\nOn 15 October Truman and MacArthur met at Wake Island. This was much publicized because of MacArthur's discourteous refusal to meet the president in the contiguous US. To Truman, MacArthur speculated there was little risk of Chinese intervention in Korea, and the PRC's opportunity for aiding the KPA had lapsed. He believed the PRC had 300,000 soldiers in Manchuria and 100,000\u2013125,000 at the Yalu River. He concluded that, although half of those forces might cross south, \"if the Chinese tried to get down to Pyongyang, there would be the greatest slaughter\" without Soviet air force protection.\nMeanwhile, on 13 October, the Politburo decided China would intervene even without Soviet air support, basing its decision on a belief superior morale could defeat an enemy that had superior equipment. To that end, 200,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) troops crossed the Yalu into North Korea. UN aerial reconnaissance had difficulty sighting PVA units in the daytime, because their march and bivouac discipline minimized detection. The PVA marched \"dark-to-dark\" (19:00\u201303:00), and aerial camouflage (concealing soldiers, pack animals, and equipment) was deployed by 05:30. Meanwhile, daylight advance parties scouted for the next bivouac site. During daylight activity or marching, soldiers remained motionless if an aircraft appeared; PVA officers were under orders to shoot security violators. Such battlefield discipline allowed a three-division army to march the from An-tung, Manchuria, to the combat zone in 19 days. Another division night-marched a circuitous mountain route, averaging daily for 18 days.\nAfter secretly crossing the Yalu River on 19 October, the PVA 13th Army Group launched the First Phase Offensive on 25 October, attacking advancing UN forces near the Sino-Korean border. This decision made solely by China changed the attitude of the Soviet Union. Twelve days after PVA troops entered the war, Stalin allowed the Soviet Air Forces to provide air cover and supported more aid to China. After inflicting heavy losses on the ROK II Corps at the Battle of Onjong, the first confrontation between Chinese and US military occurred on 1 November 1950. Deep in North Korea, thousands of soldiers from the PVA 39th Army encircled and attacked the US 8th Cavalry Regiment with three-prong assaults\u2014from the north, northwest, and west\u2014and overran the defensive position flanks in the Battle of Unsan.\nOn 13 November, Mao appointed Zhou overall commander and coordinator of the war effort, with Peng Dehuai as field commander. On 25 November, on the Korean western front, the PVA 13th Army Group attacked and overran the ROK II Corps at the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River, and then inflicted heavy losses on the US 2nd Infantry Division on the UN forces' right flank. Believing they could not hold against the PVA, the Eighth Army began to retreat, crossing the 38th parallel in mid-December.\nIn the east, on 27 November, the PVA 9th Army Group initiated the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. Here, the UN forces fared better: like the Eighth Army, the surprise attack forced X Corps to retreat from northeast Korea, but they were able to break out from the attempted encirclement by the PVA and execute a successful tactical withdrawal. X Corps established a defensive perimeter at the port city of Hungnam on 11 December and evacuated by 24 December, to reinforce the depleted Eighth Army to the south. About 193 shiploads of UN forces and mat\u00e9riel (approximately 105,000 soldiers, 98,000 civilians, 17,500 vehicles, and 350,000 tons of supplies) were evacuated to Pusan. The SS \"Meredith Victory\" was noted for evacuating 14,000 refugees, the largest rescue operation by a single ship, even though it was designed to hold 12 passengers. Before escaping, the UN forces razed most of Hungnam, with particular attention to the port.\nIn early December UN forces, including the British Army's 29th Infantry Brigade, evacuated Pyongyang along with refugees. Around 4.5\u00a0million North Koreans are estimated to have fled South or elsewhere abroad. On 16 December Truman declared a national state of emergency with Proclamation No. 2914, 3 C.F.R. 99 (1953), which remained in force until September 1978. The next day, 17 December, Kim Il Sung was deprived of the right of command of KPA by China.\nFighting around the 38th parallel (January\u2013June 1951).\nA ceasefire presented by the UN to the PRC, after the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River on 11 December, was rejected by the PRC, which was convinced of the PVA's invincibility after its victory in that battle and the wider Second Phase Offensive. With Lieutenant General Matthew Ridgway assuming command of the Eighth Army on 26 December following the death of previous Eighth Army commander Walton Walker, the PVA and the KPA launched their Third Phase Offensive on New Year's Eve. Using night attacks in which UN fighting positions were encircled and assaulted by numerically superior troops, who had the element of surprise, the attacks were accompanied by loud trumpets and gongs, which facilitated tactical communication and disoriented the enemy. UN forces had no familiarity with this tactic, and some soldiers panicked, abandoning their weapons and retreating to the south. The offensive overwhelmed UN forces, allowing the PVA and KPA to capture Seoul for the second time on 4 January 1951.\nThese setbacks prompted MacArthur to consider using nuclear weapons against the Chinese or North Korean interiors, intending radioactive fallout zones to interrupt the Chinese supply chains. However, upon the arrival of the charismatic General Ridgway, the \"esprit de corps\" of the bloodied Eighth Army revived.\nUN forces retreated to Suwon in the west, Wonju in the center, and the territory north of Samcheok in the east, where the battlefront stabilized. The PVA had outrun its logistics capability and was unable to press on beyond Seoul as food, ammunition, and mat\u00e9riel were carried nightly, on foot and bicycle, from the border at the Yalu River to the battle lines. On 25 January, upon finding that the PVA had abandoned their battle lines, Ridgway ordered a reconnaissance-in-force, which became Operation Thunderbolt. A full-scale advance exploiting the UN's air superiority, concluding with the UN forces reaching the Han River and recapturing Wonju.\nFollowing the failure of ceasefire negotiations in January, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 498 on 1 February, condemning the PRC as an aggressor and calling upon its forces to withdraw from Korea.\nIn early February, the ROK 11th Division ran an operation to destroy guerrillas and pro-DPRK sympathizers in the South Gyeongsang Province. The division and police committed the Geochang and Sancheong\u2013Hamyang massacres. In mid-February, the PVA counterattacked with the Fourth Phase Offensive and achieved victory at Hoengseong. However, the offensive was blunted by US IX Corps at Chipyong-ni in the center. The US 23rd Regimental Combat Team and French Battalion fought a short but desperate battle that broke the attack's momentum. The battle is sometimes known as the \"Gettysburg of the Korean War\": 5,600 U.S., and French troops were surrounded by 25,000 PVA. UN forces had previously retreated in the face of large PVA/KPA forces instead of getting cut off, but here they stood and won.\nIn the last two weeks of February, Operation Thunderbolt was followed by Operation Killer, carried out by the revitalized Eighth Army. It was a full-scale, battlefront-length attack staged for maximum exploitation of firepower to kill as many KPA and PVA troops as possible. Operation Killer concluded with US I Corps re-occupying the territory south of the Han River, and IX Corps capturing Hoengseong. On 7 March the Eighth Army attacked with Operation Ripper, expelling the PVA and the KPA from Seoul on 14 March. This was the fourth and final conquest of the city in a year, leaving it a ruin; the 1.5\u00a0million pre-war population was down to 200,000 and people suffered from food shortages.\nOn 6 March MacArthur gave a press conference where he stated \"Assuming no diminution of the enemy's flow of ground forces and materiel to the Korean battle area, a continuation of the existing limitation upon our freedom of counter-offensive action, and no major additions to our organizational strength, the battle lines cannot fail in time to reach a point of theoretical stalemate.\" No one in Washington disputed MacArthur's prediction that a stalemate would develop. But a victory, because of the commitments and risks to achieve it would entail, was no longer considered practical. The preferred course, because it would be consistent with the greater strategy and preparations against the possibility of world war, was to seek a cease-fire and negotiated settlement of Korean issues. On 12 March Ridgway gave a press conference at his command post at Yoju stating that regaining the 38th parallel would be a \"tremendous victory\" for the Eighth Army. It would mean the encroachment of communism in Korea had been stopped - exactly what the UNC had set out to accomplish. Conversely, if the Chinese failed to drive the UNC out of Korea, they would have \"failed monumentally.\" In any case, he emphasized, \"we didn't set out to conquer China.\"\nIn late April, Peng sent his deputy, Hong Xuezhi, to brief Zhou in Beijing. What Chinese soldiers feared, Hong said, was not the enemy, but having no food, bullets, or trucks to transport them to the rear when they were wounded. Zhou attempted to respond to the PVA's logistical concerns by increasing Chinese production and improving supply methods, but these were never sufficient. Large-scale air defense training programs were carried out and the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) began participating in the war from September. The Fourth Phase Offensive had not matched the achievements of the Second Phase or the limited gains of the Third Phase. The UN forces, after earlier defeats and retraining, proved much harder to infiltrate by Chinese light infantry than previously. From 31 January to 21 April, the Chinese suffered 53,000 casualties.\nOn 11 April Truman relieved General MacArthur as supreme commander for several reasons. MacArthur had crossed the 38th parallel in the mistaken belief China would not enter the war, leading to allied losses. He believed use of nuclear weapons should be his decision, not the president's. MacArthur threatened to destroy China unless it surrendered. While MacArthur felt total victory was the only honorable outcome, Truman was more pessimistic about his chances once involved in a larger war, feeling a truce and orderly withdrawal could be a valid solution. MacArthur was the subject of congressional hearings in May and June 1951, which determined he had defied the president's orders and thus violated the US Constitution. A popular criticism of MacArthur was he never spent a night in Korea and directed the war from the safety of Tokyo.\nRidgway was appointed supreme commander, and he regrouped the UN forces for successful counterattacks while General James Van Fleet assumed command of the Eighth Army. Further attacks depleted the PVA and KPA forces; Operations Courageous (23\u201328 March) and Tomahawk (23 March) were joint ground and airborne infiltrations meant to trap PVA forces between Kaesong and Seoul. UN forces advanced to the \"Kansas Line\", north of the 38th parallel.\nThe PVA counterattacked in April 1951, with the Fifth Phase Offensive, with three field armies (700,000 men). The first thrust of the offensive fell upon I Corps, which fiercely resisted in the Battle of the Imjin River (22\u201325 April) and Battle of Kapyong (22\u201325 April), blunting the impetus of the offensive, which was halted at the \"No-name Line\" north of Seoul. Casualty ratios were grievously disproportionate; Peng had expected a 2:1 ratio, but Chinese combat casualties from 22 to 29 April totaled between 40,000 and 60,000 compared to only 4,000 for the UN\u2014a ratio between 10:1 and 15:1. By the time Peng had called off the attack in the western sector on 29 April, the three participating armies had lost a third of their front-line combat strength within a week. On 15 May the PVA commenced the second impulse of the spring offensive and attacked the ROK and U.S. X Corps in the east at the Soyang River. Approximately 370,000 PVA and 114,000 KPA troops had been mobilized, with the bulk attacking in the eastern sector, with about a quarter attempting to pin the I Corps and IX Corps in the western sector. They were halted by 20 May and repulsed, with Western histories designating 22 May as the end of the offensive.\nAt month's end, the Chinese planned the third step of the Fifth Phase Offensive (withdrawal), which they estimated would take 10-15 days for their 340,000 remaining men, and set the date for 23 May. They were caught off guard when the Eighth Army counterattacked and regained the \"Kansas Line\" on 12 May, 23 hours before the expected withdrawal. The surprise attack turned the retreat into \"the most severe loss since our forces had entered Korea\"; between 16 and 23 May, the PVA suffered another 45,000 to 60,000 casualties before their soldiers managed to evacuate. The Fifth Phase Offensive as a whole had cost the PVA 102,000 soldiers (85,000 killed/wounded, 17,000 captured), with significant losses for the KPA.\nThe end of the Fifth Phase Offensive preceded the UN May\u2013June 1951 counteroffensive. During the counteroffensive, the US-led coalition captured land up to about north of the 38th parallel, with most forces stopping at the \"Kansas Line\" and a minority going to the \"Wyoming Line.\" PVA and KPA forces suffered greatly, especially in the Chuncheon sector and at Chiam-ni and Hwacheon; in the latter sector alone the PVA/KPA suffered over 73,207 casualties, including 8,749 captured, compared to 2,647 total casualties of the IX Corps.\nThe halt at the \"Kansas Line\" and offensive action stand-down began the stalemate that lasted until the armistice of 1953. The disastrous failure of the Fifth Phase Offensive \"led Chinese leaders to change their goal from driving the UNF out of Korea to merely defending China's security and ending the war through negotiations\".\nStalemate (July 1951\u2013July 1953).\nFor the rest of the war, the UN and the PVA/KPA fought but exchanged little territory. Large-scale bombing of North Korea continued, and protracted armistice negotiations began on 10 July 1951 at Kaesong in the North. On the Chinese side, Zhou directed peace talks, and Li Kenong and Qiao Guanghua headed the negotiation team. Combat continued; the goal of the UN forces was to recapture all of South Korea and avoid losing territory. The PVA and the KPA attempted similar operations and later effected military and psychological operations to test the UN Command's resolve to continue the war.\nThe sides constantly traded artillery fire along the front, with American-led forces possessing a large firepower advantage over Chinese-led forces. In the last three months of 1952 the UN fired 3,553,518 field gun shells and 2,569,941 mortar shells, while the communists fired 377,782 field gun shells and 672,194 mortar shells: a 5.8:1 ratio. The communist insurgency, reinvigorated by North Korean support and scattered bands of KPA stragglers, resurged in the south.\nIn the autumn of 1951, Van Fleet ordered Major General Paik Sun-yup to break the back of guerrilla activity. The UN's limited offensive (31 August \u2013 12 November) to shorten and straighten sections of the lines, acquire better defensive terrain, and deny the enemy key vantage points, saw heavy fighting by UN forces, with I Corps and X Corps making limited tactical advances against PVA and KPA forces. The campaign resulted in approximately 60,000 casualties, including 22,000 Americans. The intense battles at Bloody Ridge, the Punchbowl and Heartbreak Ridge underscored the challenges of penetrating the Chinese \"active defense.\" Despite PVA/KPA losses of 100,000\u2013150,000 troops, these were not crippling, and the PVA forces remained resolute. By November, the UNC abandoned major offensive operations, and the PVA launched counterattacks with some success.\nFrom December 1951 to March 1952, ROK security forces claimed to have killed 11,090 partisans and sympathizers and captured 9,916 more.\nPVA troops suffered from deficient military equipment, logistical problems, overextended communication and supply lines, and the constant threat of UN bombers. These factors led to a rate of Chinese casualties far greater than the casualties suffered by UN troops. The situation became so serious that in November 1951 Zhou called a conference in Shenyang to discuss the PVA's logistical problems. It was decided to accelerate the construction of railways and airfields, to increase the trucks available to the army, and to improve air defense by any means possible. These commitments did little to address the problems.\nIn the months after the Shenyang conference, Peng went to Beijing several times to brief Mao and Zhou about the heavy casualties and the increasing difficulty of keeping front lines supplied with basic necessities. Peng was convinced the war would be protracted and that neither side would be able to achieve victory in the near future. On 24 February 1952, the Military Commission, presided over by Zhou, discussed the PVA's logistical problems with members of government agencies. After government representatives emphasized their inability to meet the war demands, Peng shouted: \"You have this and that problem... You should go to the front and see with your own eyes what food and clothing the soldiers have! Not to speak of the casualties! For what are they giving their lives? We have no aircraft. We have only a few guns. Transports are not protected. More and more soldiers are dying of starvation. Can't you overcome some of your difficulties?\" The atmosphere became so tense Zhou was forced to adjourn the conference. Zhou called a series of meetings, where it was agreed the PVA would be divided into three groups, to be dispatched to Korea in shifts; to accelerate training of pilots; to provide more anti-aircraft guns to front lines; to purchase more military equipment and ammunition from the Soviet Union; to provide the army with more food and clothing; and to transfer the responsibility of logistics to the central government.\nGeneral Mark W. Clark replaced General Ridgway as commander of the United Nations Command on 12 May 1952.\nWith peace negotiations ongoing, the Chinese attempted a final offensive in the final weeks of the war to capture territory: on 10 June, 30,000 Chinese troops struck South Korean and U.S. divisions on a front, and on 13 July, 80,000 Chinese soldiers struck the east-central Kumsong sector, with the brunt of their attack falling on 4 South Korean divisions. The Chinese had success in penetrating South Korean lines but failed to capitalize, particularly when US forces responded with overwhelming firepower. Chinese casualties in their final major offensive (above normal wastage for the front) were about 72,000, including 25,000 killed compared to 14,000 for the UN (most were South Koreans, 1,611 were Americans).\nWhile Chinese forces grappled with significant logistical and supply difficulties, the stalemate also stemmed from mounting frustrations within the UNC. Despite superior firepower, the war proved difficult to fight and the US public was becoming impatient of a war that was lacking a victory. By mid-1951, the stalemate had worn away Truman's , and political pressures mounted on the Truman administration to seek an end to the fighting. On 29 November 1952 U.S. President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower went to Korea to learn what might end the war. Eisenhower took office on 20 January 1953 and his administration prioritized containment over rollback and sought to reduce American involvement in the conflict, contributing to the later armistice.\nArmistice (July 1953\u2013November 1954).\nThe on-again, off-again negotiations for the armistice spanned over two years (1951-1953), first at Kaesong, then Panmunjom. and was the longest negotiated armistice in history. A problematic point was prisoner of war repatriation. The PVA, KPA and UN Command could not agree on a system of repatriation because many PVA and KPA soldiers refused to be repatriated back to the north, which was unacceptable to the Chinese and North Koreans. On 3 December 1952 the UNGA accepted India's proposed Korean War armistice, voted as Resolution 610(VII), and thus was born the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.\nStalin died on 5 March. The new Soviet leaders, engaged in their internal power struggle, had no desire to continue supporting China's efforts and called for an end to the hostilities. China could not continue without Soviet aid, and North Korea was no longer a major player. Armistice talks entered a new phase especially after the May 1953 test of the novel nuclear artillery shell by the Americans. The KPA, PVA and UN Command signed the armistice agreement on 27 July 1953. South Korean President Syngman Rhee refused to sign. The war ended at this point, even though there was no peace treaty. North Korea nevertheless claims it won the war.\nUnder the agreement, the belligerents established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) which mostly follows the 38th parallel. In the eastern part, the DMZ runs north of the 38th parallel; to the west, it travels south of it. Kaesong, site of the initial negotiations, was in pre-war South Korea but is now part of North Korea. The DMZ has since been patrolled by the KPA and the ROKA, with the US still operating as the UN Command.\nOperation Glory was conducted from July to November 1954, to allow combatants to exchange their dead. The remains of 4,167 US Army and US Marine Corps dead were exchanged for 13,528 KPA and PVA dead, and 546 civilians dead in UN POW camps were delivered to the South Korean government. After Operation Glory, 416 Korean War unknown soldiers were buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, on Oahu, Hawaii. Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) records indicate the PRC and North Korea transmitted 1,394 names, of which 858 were correct. From 4,167 containers of returned remains, forensic examination identified 4,219 individuals. Of these, 2,944 were identified as from the US, and all but 416 were identified by name. From 1996 to 2006, North Korea recovered 220 remains near the Sino-Korean border.\nContinued division (1954\u2013present).\nThe Armistice Agreement provided for monitoring by an international commission. Since 1953, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, composed of members from the Swiss and Swedish armed forces, has been stationed near the Korean Demilitarized Zone.\nIn April 1975, South Vietnam's capital of Saigon was captured by the People's Army of Vietnam. Encouraged by that communist success, Kim Il Sung saw it as an opportunity to invade South Korea. Kim visited China in April 1975 and met with Mao and Zhou to ask for military aid. Despite Pyongyang's expectations, Beijing refused to help North Korea in another war.\nSince the armistice, there have been incursions and acts of aggression by North Korea. From 1966 to 1969, many cross-border incursions took place in what has been referred to as the Korean DMZ Conflict or Second Korean War. In 1968, a North Korean commando team unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate South Korean president Park Chung Hee in the Blue House Raid. In 1976, the Korean axe murder incident was widely publicized. Since 1974, 4 incursion tunnels leading to Seoul have been uncovered. In 2010, a North Korean submarine torpedoed and sank the South Korean corvette , resulting in the deaths of 46 sailors. Again in 2010, North Korea fired artillery shells on Yeonpyeong island, killing 2 military personnel and 2 civilians.\nAfter a new wave of UN sanctions, on 11 March 2013, North Korea claimed that the armistice had become invalid. On 13 March, North Korea confirmed it ended the Armistice and declared North Korea \"is not restrained by the north\u2013south declaration on non-aggression\". On 30 March, North Korea stated it entered a \"state of war\" and \"the long-standing situation of the Korean peninsula being neither at peace nor at war is finally over\". Speaking on 4 April, US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said that Pyongyang \"formally informed\" the Pentagon that it \"ratified\" the potential use of a nuclear weapon against South Korea, Japan and the US, including Guam and Hawaii. Hagel stated the US would deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-ballistic missile system to Guam because of a credible and realistic nuclear threat.\nIn 2016, it was revealed North Korea approached the US about conducting formal peace talks to end the war officially. While the White House agreed to secret peace talks, the plan was rejected because North Korea refused to discuss nuclear disarmament as part of the treaty. In 2018, it was announced that North Korea and South Korea agreed to talk to end the conflict. They committed themselves to the complete denuclearization of the Peninsula. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in signed the Panmunjom Declaration. In September 2021, Moon reiterated his call to end the war formally, in a speech at the UN.\nCasualties.\nAbout 3\u00a0million people were killed in the war, mostly civilians, making it perhaps the deadliest conflict of the Cold War era. Samuel Kim lists the Korean War as the deadliest conflict in East Asia, and the region most affected by armed conflict related to the Cold War.\nCivilian.\nThough only rough estimates of civilian fatalities are available, scholars have noted that the percentage of civilian casualties in Korea was higher than in World War II or the Vietnam War, with historian Bruce Cumings putting civilian casualties at 2\u00a0million and Guenter Lewy in the range of 2\u20133\u00a0million. According to one source, 1,658,436 civilians died, meaning a 74% civilian death rate.\nCumings states that civilians represent at least half the war's casualties, while Lewy suggests it may have gone as high as 70%, compared to his estimates of 42% in World War II and 30\u201346% in Vietnam. Data compiled by the Peace Research Institute Oslo lists just under 1\u00a0million battle deaths over the war and a mid-estimate of 3\u00a0million total deaths, attributing the difference to excess mortality among civilians from one-sided massacres, starvation, and disease. Compounding this devastation for civilians, virtually all major cities on the Peninsula were destroyed. In per capita and absolute terms, North Korea was the most devastated by the war. According to Charles K. Armstrong, the war resulted in the death of an estimated 12%\u201315% of the North Korean population (c. 10\u00a0million), \"a figure close to or surpassing the proportion of Soviet citizens killed in World War II\".\nAccording to the South Korean Ministry of National Defense, there were over 750,000 confirmed violent civilian deaths during the war, another million civilians were pronounced missing, and millions more ended up as refugees. Estimates of the number of civilians killed in the entire war range from 244,000 to 990,000 for South Korea. The North Korean government has never published estimates of civilian deaths in the war, but more than 1 million North Korean civilians and non-combatants killed has been an estimate common among historians who have studied the Korean War. Over 1.5\u00a0million North Koreans fled to the South.\nMilitary.\nSouth Korea reported 137,899 military deaths and 24,495 missing, 450,742 wounded, and 8,343 prisoners. The United States suffered 33,739 deaths in battle, including those missing and declared dead, and 2,835 non-battle deaths. There were 17,730 other non-battle US military deaths outside Korea during the same period erroneously included as war deaths until 2000. The US suffered 103,284 wounded in action. \nAmerican combat casualties were over 90% of non-Korean UN losses. US battle deaths were 8,516 up to their first engagement with the Chinese on 1 November 1950. The first four months prior to the Chinese intervention were by far the bloodiest per day for US forces, as they engaged the well-equipped KPA in intense fighting. American medical records show that from July to October 1950, the army sustained 31% of the combat deaths it ultimately incurred in the entire 37-month war. 1,789,000 American soldiers served in the war, accounting for 31% of the 5,720,000 Americans who served on active duty worldwide from 1950 to 1953.\nDeaths from non-American militaries for the United Nations Command totaled 3,730, with another 379 missing. \nChinese sources reported that the PVA suffered 114,000 battle deaths, 21,000 deaths from wounds, 13,000 deaths from illness, 340,000 wounded, and 7,600 missing. 7,110 Chinese POWs were repatriated to China. In 2010, the Chinese government revised its official tally of war losses to 183,108 dead (114,084 in combat, 70,000 deaths from wounds, illness and other causes) and 25,621 missing, a total of 208,729 dead or missing. In 2020, Chinese state media reported the number of Chinese soldiers killed in the war at 197,653. Overall, 73% of Chinese infantry troops served in Korea (25 of 34 armies, or 79 of 109 infantry divisions, were rotated in). More than 52% of the Chinese air force, 55% of the tank units, 67% of the artillery divisions, and 100% of the railroad engineering divisions were sent to Korea as well. Chinese soldiers who served in Korea faced a greater chance of being killed than those who served in World War II or the Chinese Civil War. China spent over 10\u00a0billion yuan on the war (roughly US $3.3\u00a0billion), not counting USSR aid. This included US $1.3\u00a0billion in money owed to the Soviet Union by the end of it. This was a relatively large cost, as China had only 4% of the national income of the United States. Spending on the war constituted 34\u201343% of China's annual government budget from 1950 to 1953, depending on the year. Despite its underdeveloped economy, Chinese military spending was the world's fourth largest globally for most of the war after that of the US, the Soviet Union, and the UK; however, by 1953, with the winding down of the Korean War and the escalation of the First Indochina War, French spending also surpassed Chinese spending by about a third.\nAccording to the South Korean Ministry of National Defense, North Korean military losses totaled 294,151 dead, 91,206 missing, and 229,849 wounded, giving North Korea the highest military deaths of any belligerent in absolute and relative terms. The PRIO Battle Deaths Dataset gave a similar figure for North Korean military deaths of 316,579. Chinese sources reported similar figures for the North Korean military of 290,000 \"casualties\" and 90,000 captured. The financial cost for North Korea was massive indirect losses and lost economic activity; the country was devastated by the cost of the war and the American bombing campaign, which, among other things, destroyed 85% of North Korea's buildings and 95% of its power generation. The Soviet Union suffered 299 dead, with 335 planes lost.\nThe Chinese and North Koreans estimated that about 390,000 soldiers from the US, 660,000 soldiers from South Korea and 29,000 other UN soldiers were \"eliminated\" from the battlefield. Western sources estimate the PVA suffered about 400,000 killed and 486,000 wounded, while the KPA suffered 215,000 killed, 303,000 wounded, and over 101,000 captured or missing. Cumings cites a much higher figure of 900,000 fatalities among Chinese soldiers.\nWar crimes.\nThere were numerous atrocities and massacres of civilians throughout the Korean War committed by both sides, starting in the war's first days. In 2005\u20132010, a South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission investigated atrocities and other human rights violations through much of the 20th century, from the Japanese colonial period through the Korean War and beyond. It excavated some mass graves from the Bodo League massacres and confirmed the general outlines of those political executions. Of the Korean War-era massacres the commission was petitioned to investigate, 82% were perpetrated by South Korean forces, with 18% perpetrated by North Korean forces.\nThe commission also received petitions alleging more than 200 large-scale killings of South Korean civilians by the U.S. military during the war, mostly air attacks. It confirmed several such cases, including refugees crowded into a cave attacked with napalm bombs, which survivors said killed 360 people, and an air attack that killed 197 refugees gathered in a field in the far south. It recommended South Korea seek reparations from the United States, but in 2010, a reorganized commission under a new, conservative government concluded that most U.S. mass killings resulted from \"military necessity\", while in a small number of cases, they concluded, the U.S. military had acted with \"low levels of unlawfulness\", but the commission recommended against seeking reparations.\nAlmost every substantial building in North Korea was destroyed during the war. The war's highest-ranking U.S. POW, Major General William F. Dean, reported that the majority of North Korean cities and villages he saw were either rubble or snow-covered wasteland. North Korean factories, schools, hospitals, and government offices were forced to move underground, and air defenses were \"non-existent\". North Korea ranks as among the most heavily bombed countries in history, and the U.S. dropped a total of 635,000 tons of bombs (including 32,557 tons of napalm) on Korea, more than during the entire Pacific War. By the end of the war, eighteen of the twenty-two major cities in North Korea had been at least half obliterated according to damage assessments by the U.S. Air Force. During a Senate hearing in the spring of 1951, MacArthur expressed his horror at the devastation that the war was inflicting on the Koreans, describing it as the worst he had ever seen in his military career. As the most humane solution, MacArthur suggested that the war should be escalated in order to bring it to an end sooner.\nCharacteristics.\nU.S. unpreparedness.\nIn postwar analysis of the unpreparedness of US forces deployed during the summer and fall of 1950, Army Major General Floyd L. Parks stated \"Many who never lived to tell the tale had to fight the full range of ground warfare from offensive to delaying action, unit by unit, man by man ... [T]hat we were able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat ... does not relieve us from the blame of having placed our own flesh and blood in such a predicament.\"\nBy 1950, US Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson had established a policy of faithfully following Truman's defense economization plans and aggressively attempted to implement it, even in the face of steadily increasing external threats. He consequently received much of the blame for the initial setbacks and widespread reports of ill-equipped and inadequately trained military forces in the war's early stages.\nAs an initial response to the invasion, Truman called for a naval blockade of North Korea and was shocked to learn that such a blockade could be imposed only \"on paper\" since the U.S. Navy no longer had the warships with which to carry out his request. Army officials, desperate for weaponry, recovered Sherman tanks and other equipment from Pacific War battlefields and reconditioned them for shipment to Korea. Army ordnance officials at Fort Knox pulled down M26 Pershing tanks from display pedestals around Fort Knox in order to equip the third company of the Army's hastily formed 70th Tank Battalion. Without adequate numbers of tactical fighter-bomber aircraft, the Air Force took F-51 (P-51) propeller-driven aircraft out of storage or from existing Air National Guard squadrons and rushed them into front-line service. A shortage of spare parts and qualified maintenance personnel resulted in improvised repairs and overhauls. A Navy helicopter pilot aboard an active duty warship recalled fixing damaged rotor blades with masking tape in the absence of spares.\nU.S. Army Reserve and Army National Guard infantry soldiers and new inductees (called to duty to fill out understrength infantry divisions) found themselves short of nearly everything needed to repel the North Korean forces: artillery, ammunition, heavy tanks, ground-support aircraft, even effective anti-tank weapons such as the M20 3.5-inch (89\u00a0mm) \"Super Bazooka\". Some Army combat units sent to Korea were supplied with worn-out, \"red-lined\" M1 rifles or carbines in immediate need of ordnance depot overhaul or repair. Only the Marine Corps, whose commanders had stored and maintained their World War II surplus inventories of equipment and weapons, proved ready for deployment, though they still were woefully understrength, as well as in need of suitable landing craft to practice amphibious operations (Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson had transferred most of the remaining craft to the Navy and reserved them for use in training Army units).\nArmored warfare.\nThe initial assault by KPA forces was aided by the use of Soviet T-34-85 tanks. A KPA tank corps equipped with about 120 T-34s spearheaded the invasion. These faced an ROK that had few anti-tank weapons adequate to deal with the T-34s. Additional Soviet armor was added as the offensive progressed. The KPA tanks had a good deal of early successes against ROK infantry, Task Force Smith, and the U.S. M24 Chaffee light tanks that they encountered. Interdiction by ground attack aircraft was the only means of slowing the advancing KPA armor. The tide turned in favor of the UN forces in August 1950 when the KPA suffered major tank losses during a series of battles in which the UN forces brought heavier equipment to bear, including American M4A3 Sherman and M26 medium tanks, alongside British Centurion, Churchill and Cromwell tanks.\nThe Incheon landings on 15 September cut off the KPA supply lines, causing their armored forces and infantry to run out of fuel, ammunition, and other supplies. As a result of this and the Pusan perimeter breakout, the KPA had to retreat, and many of the T-34s and heavy weapons had to be abandoned. By the time the KPA withdrew from the South, 239 T-34s and 74 SU-76 self-propelled guns were lost. After November 1950, KPA armor was rarely encountered.\nFollowing the initial assault by the North, the Korean War saw limited use of tanks and featured no large-scale tank battles. The mountainous, forested terrain, especially in the eastern central zone, was poor tank country, limiting their mobility. Through the last two years of the war in Korea, UN tanks served largely as infantry support and mobile artillery pieces.\nNaval warfare.\nBecause neither Korea had a significant navy, the war featured few naval battles. A skirmish between North Korea and the UN Command occurred on 2 July 1950; the U.S. Navy cruiser , the Royal Navy cruiser and the Royal Navy frigate fought four North Korean torpedo boats and two mortar gunboats, and sank them. USS \"Juneau\" later sank several ammunition ships that had been present. The last sea battle of the Korean War occurred days before the Battle of Incheon; the ROK ship \"PC-703\" sank a North Korean minelayer in the Battle of Haeju Island, near Incheon. Three other supply ships were sunk by \"PC-703\" two days later in the Yellow Sea.\nDuring most of the war, the UN navies patrolled the west and east coasts of North Korea, sinking supply and ammunition ships and denying the North Koreans the ability to resupply from the sea. Aside from very occasional gunfire from North Korean shore batteries, the main threat to UN navy ships was from magnetic mines. During the war, five U.S. Navy ships were lost to mines: two minesweepers, two minesweeper escorts, and one ocean tug. Mines and coastal artillery damaged another 87 U.S. warships.\nAerial warfare.\nThe Korean War was the first in which jet aircraft played the central role in air combat. Once-formidable fighters such as the P-51 Mustang, F4U Corsair, and Hawker Sea Fury\u2014all piston-engined, propeller-driven, and designed during World War II\u2014relinquished their air-superiority roles to a new generation of faster, jet-powered fighters arriving in the theater. For the initial months of the war, the P-80 Shooting Star, F9F Panther, Gloster Meteor, and other jets under the UN flag dominated the Korean People's Air Force (KPAF) propeller-driven Soviet Yakovlev Yak-9 and Lavochkin La-9s. By early August 1950, the KPAF was reduced to only about 20 planes.\nThe Chinese intervention in late October 1950 bolstered the KPAF with the MiG-15, one of the world's most advanced jet fighters. The USAF countered the MiG-15 by sending over three squadrons of its most capable fighter, the F-86 Sabre. These arrived in December 1950. The Soviet Union denied the involvement of their personnel in anything other than an advisory role, but air combat quickly resulted in Soviet pilots dropping their code signals and speaking over the radio in Russian. This known direct Soviet participation was a \"casus belli\" that the UN Command deliberately overlooked, lest the war expand to include the Soviet Union and potentially escalate into atomic warfare.\nAfter the war and to the present day, the USAF reported an inflated F-86 Sabre kill ratio in excess of 10:1, with 792 MiG-15s and 108 other aircraft shot down by Sabres, and 78 Sabres lost to enemy fire. The Soviet Air Force reported some 1,100 air-to-air victories and 335 MiG combat losses, while China's PLAAF reported 231 combat losses, mostly MiG-15s, and 168 other aircraft lost. The KPAF reported no data, but the UN Command estimates some 200 KPAF aircraft lost in the war's first stage, and 70 additional aircraft after the Chinese intervention. The USAF disputes Soviet and Chinese claims of 650 and 211 downed F-86s, respectively.\nMore modern American estimates place the overall USAF kill ratio at around 1.8:1 with the ratio dropping to 1.3:1 against MiG-15s with Soviet pilots but increasing to a dominant 12:1 against Chinese and North Korean adversaries.\nReports by Lieutenant General Sidor Slyusarev, commander of Soviet air forces in Korea, are more favorable to the communist side. The 64th Corps claimed a total 1,097 enemy aircraft of all types during operations, for the loss of 335 aircraft (including lost to enemy ground fire, accidents, etc.) and 110 pilots. Soviet reports put the overall kill ratio at 3.4:1 in favor of Soviet pilots. As reported, effectiveness of the Soviet fighters declined as the war progressed. from an overall kill ratio of 7.9:1 from November 1950 through January 1952, declining to 2.2:1 in later 1952 and 1.9:1 in 1953. This was because more advanced jet fighters appeared on the UN side as well as improved U.S. tactics.\nRegardless of the actual ratio, American Sabres were very effective at controlling the skies over Korea. Since no other UN fighter could contend with the MiG-15, F-86s largely took over air combat once they arrived, relegating other aircraft to air-to-ground operations. Despite much greater numbers (the number of Sabres in theater never exceeded 150 while MiG-15s reached 900 at their peak), communist aircraft were seldom encountered south of Pyongyang. UN ground forces, supply lines, and infrastructure were not attacked from the air. Although North Korea had 75 airfields capable of supporting MiGs, after 1951, any serious effort to operate from them was abandoned. The MiGs were instead based across the Yalu River in the safety of China. This confined most air-to-air engagements to MiG Alley. UN aircraft had free rein to conduct strike missions over enemy territory with little fear of interception. Although jet dogfights are remembered as a prominent part of the Korean War, counter-air missions comprised just 12% of Far East Air Forces sorties, and four times as many sorties were performed for close air support and interdiction.\nThe war marked a major milestone not only for fixed-wing aircraft, but also for rotorcraft, featuring the first large-scale deployment of helicopters for medical evacuation (medevac). In 1944\u201345, during World War II, the YR-4 helicopter had seen limited ambulance duty. In Korea, where rough terrain prevented use of the jeep as a speedy medevac vehicle, helicopters like the Sikorsky H-19 were heavily used. This helped reduce fatal casualties to a dramatic degree when combined with complementary medical innovations such as Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals (MASH). As such, the medical evacuation and care system for the wounded was so effective for the UN forces that a wounded soldier who arrived at a MASH unit alive typically had a 97% chance of survival. The limitations of jet aircraft for close air support highlighted the helicopter's potential in the role, leading to the development of the helicopter gunships used in the Vietnam War.\nU.S. threat of atomic warfare.\nOn 5 November 1950, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff issued orders for the retaliatory atomic bombing of Manchurian PRC military bases, if either of their armies crossed into Korea or if PRC or KPA bombers attacked Korea from there. Truman ordered the transfer of nine Mark 4 nuclear bombs \"to the Air Force's Ninth Bomb Group, the designated carrier of the weapons ... [and] signed an order to use them against Chinese and Korean targets\", which he never transmitted.\nMany U.S. officials viewed the deployment of nuclear-capable (but not nuclear-armed) B-29 bombers to Britain as helping to resolve the Berlin Blockade of 1948\u201349. Truman and Eisenhower had military experience and viewed nuclear weapons as potentially usable. During Truman's first meeting to discuss the war in June 1950, he ordered plans for attacking Soviet forces if they entered the war. By July, Truman approved another B-29 deployment to Britain, this time with bombs, to remind the Soviets of U.S. offensive ability. Deployment of a similar fleet to Guam was leaked to \"The New York Times\". As UN forces retreated to Pusan, and the CIA reported that China was building up forces for a possible invasion of Taiwan, the Pentagon believed Congress and the public would demand using nuclear weapons if the situation in Korea required them.\nAs PVA forces pushed back the UN forces from the Yalu River, Truman stated during a 30 November 1950 press conference that using nuclear weapons was \"always [under] active consideration\", with control under the local commander. Indian ambassador K. Madhava Panikkar reports \"that Truman announced he was thinking of using the atom bomb in Korea. But the Chinese seemed unmoved by this threat ... The PRC's propaganda against the U.S. was stepped up. The 'Aid Korea to resist America' campaign was made the slogan for increased production, greater national integration, and more rigid control over anti-national activities. One could not help feeling that Truman's threat came in useful to the leaders of the Revolution...\"\nAfter his statement caused concern in Europe, Truman met on 4 December with UK Prime Minister and Commonwealth spokesman Clement Attlee, and French Premier Ren\u00e9 Pleven to discuss their worries about atomic warfare and its likely continental expansion. The U.S.' forgoing atomic warfare was not because of \"a disinclination by the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China to escalate\", but because UN allies\u2014notably the UK, the Commonwealth, and France\u2014were concerned about a geopolitical imbalance rendering NATO defenseless while the U.S. fought China, who might persuade the Soviet Union to conquer Western Europe. The Joint Chiefs of Staff advised Truman to tell Attlee that the U.S. would use nuclear weapons only if necessary to protect an evacuation of UN troops, or prevent a \"major military disaster\".\nOn 6 December after the Chinese intervention repelled the UN armies from northern North Korea, General J. Lawton Collins, General MacArthur, Admiral C. Turner Joy, General George E. Stratemeyer and Major General Doyle Hickey, Major General Charles A. Willoughby and Major General Edwin K. Wright met in Tokyo to plan strategy countering the Chinese intervention; they considered three atomic warfare scenarios encompassing the next weeks and months.\nThe Pentagon and State Department were cautious about using nuclear weapons because of the risk of general war with China. Truman and his advisors agreed and never seriously considered using them in early December 1950, despite the poor military situation in Korea.\nIn 1951, the U.S. escalated closest to atomic warfare in Korea. Because China deployed new armies to the Sino-Korean frontier, ground crews at the Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, assembled atomic bombs, \"lacking only the essential pit nuclear cores.\" In October 1951, the US effected Operation Hudson Harbor to establish a nuclear weapons capability. B-29 bombers practiced individual bombing runs from Okinawa to North Korea (using dummy bombs). Hudson Harbor tested \"actual functioning of all activities which would be involved in an atomic strike, including weapons assembly and testing, leading, [and] ground control of bomb aiming\". The data indicated that atomic bombs would be tactically ineffective against massed infantry, because the \"timely identification of large masses of enemy troops was extremely rare\".\nRidgway was authorized to use nuclear weapons if a major air attack originated from outside Korea. An envoy was sent to Hong Kong to deliver a warning to China. The message likely caused China to be more cautious about potential U.S. use of nuclear weapons, but whether they learned about the B-29 deployment is unclear, and the failure of Chinese offensives that month likely was what caused them to shift to a defensive strategy. The B-29s returned to the US in June.\nDespite the greater destructive power atomic weapons would bring, their effect on determining the war's outcome would have likely been minimal. Given the dispersed nature of PVA/KPA forces, the relatively primitive infrastructure for staging and logistics centers, and the small number of bombs available (most would have been conserved for use against the Soviets), atomic attacks would have limited effects against the ability of China to move forces. Attacking Chinese cities to destroy industry and infrastructure would cause immediate dispersion of the leadership and give propaganda to the communists to galvanize support. Since the Soviets were not expected to intervene with their few atomic weapons, the threat of nuclear exchange was unimportant in the decision not to deploy atomic bombs. Their use offered little operational advantage and would undesirably lower the \"threshold\" for using atomic weapons against non-nuclear states in future conflicts.\nWhen Eisenhower succeeded Truman in 1953, he was similarly cautious about using nuclear weapons in Korea. Kenneth Nichols wrote that President Eisenhower \"ended the Korean hostilities by discreetly threatening to use atomic weapons if the North Koreans and the Chinese did not agree to a cessation of hostilities\". The administration prepared contingency plans to use them against China, but like Truman, he feared doing so would result in Soviet attacks on Japan. The war ended as it began, without U.S. nuclear weapons deployed.\nAftermath.\nNorth Korea.\nAs a result of the war, \"North Korea had been virtually destroyed as an industrial society\". After the armistice, Kim Il Sung requested Soviet economic and industrial assistance. In September 1953, the Soviet government agreed to \"cancel or postpone repayment for all ... outstanding debts\", and promised to grant North Korea one billion rubles in monetary aid, industrial equipment and consumer goods. Eastern European members of the Soviet Bloc also contributed with \"logistical support, technical aid, [and] medical supplies\". China canceled North Korea's war debts, provided 800\u00a0million yuan, promised trade cooperation and sent in thousands of troops to rebuild damaged infrastructure. Contemporary North Korea remains underdeveloped and continues to be a totalitarian dictatorship since the end of the war, with an elaborate cult of personality around the Kim dynasty.\nPresent-day North Korea follows \"Songun\", or \"military-first\" policy and has the highest number of military and paramilitary personnel in the world, with 7,769,000 active, reserve and paramilitary personnel, or approximately of its population. Its active-duty army of 1.28 million is the fourth largest in the world, after China, the United States and India; consisting of of its population. North Korea possesses nuclear weapons. A 2014 UN inquiry into abuses of human rights in North Korea concluded that, \"the gravity, scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world,\" with Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch holding similar views.\nSouth Korea.\nPostwar recovery was different in the two Koreas. South Korea, which started from a far lower industrial base than North Korea (the latter contained 80% of Korea's heavy industry in 1945), stagnated in the first postwar decade. In 1953, South Korea, and the United States signed a Mutual Defense Treaty.\nSouth Korean anti-Americanism after the war was fueled by the presence and behavior of United States Forces Korea military personnel and U.S. support for Park's authoritarian regime, a fact still evident during the country's democratic transition in the 1980s. However, anti-Americanism has declined significantly in South Korea in recent years, from 46% favorable in 2003 to 74% favorable in 2011, making South Korea one of the most pro-U.S. countries.\nA large number of mixed-race \"GI babies\" (offspring of U.S. and other UN soldiers and Korean women) were filling up the country's orphanages. Because Korean traditional society places significant weight on paternal family ties, bloodlines, and purity of race, children of mixed race or those without fathers are not easily accepted in South Korean society. International adoption of Korean children began in 1954. The U.S. Immigration Act of 1952 legalized the naturalization of non-Blacks and non-Whites as U.S. citizens and made possible the entry of military spouses and children from South Korea. With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1965, which substantially changed U.S. immigration policy toward non-Europeans, Koreans became one of the fastest-growing Asian groups in the United States.\nUnited States.\nThe indelible meaning of the war for Americans was the unprecedented and new American military-industrial complex that arose in the 1950s. The United States spent US $30 billion on the Korean War. The Korean War transformed the United States into a nation very different than it had ever been before: one with hundreds of permanent military bases abroad, a large standing army, and a permanent national security state at home. In a chapter titled, \"A \"Forgotten War\" that Remade the United States and the Cold War\", Bruce Cumings stated:\"Americans assume that the Vietnam War is far more important \u2026 Korea, however, had an enormous refractory effect back upon the United States. It didn\u2019t brand a generation, and it may be forgotten or unknown to the general public, but it was the occasion for transforming the United States into a country that the founding fathers would barely recognize. Is this phenomenon well known? It has been to some scholars for a generation. Otherwise, it isn\u2019t.\"\nCommunism.\nMao Zedong's decision to take on the United States was a direct attempt to confront what the communist bloc viewed as the strongest anti-communist power in the world, undertaken at a time when the Chinese communist regime was still consolidating its own power. Mao supported intervention not to save North Korea, but because he believed that a military conflict with the U.S. was inevitable after the U.S. entered the war, and to appease the Soviet Union to secure military dispensation and achieve Mao's goal of making China a major world military power. Mao was equally ambitious in improving his own prestige inside the communist international community. In his later years, Mao believed that Stalin only gained a positive opinion of him after China's entrance into the Korean War. Inside mainland China, the war improved the long-term prestige of Mao, Zhou, and Peng, allowing the Chinese Communist Party to increase its legitimacy while weakening anti-communist dissent.\nThe Chinese government has encouraged the viewpoint that the war was initiated by the United States and South Korea, though ComIntern documents have shown that Mao sought approval from Stalin to enter the war. In Chinese media, the Chinese war effort is considered as an example of China's engaging the strongest power in the world with an underequipped army, forcing it to retreat, and fighting it to a military stalemate. These successes were contrasted with China's historical humiliations by Japan and by Western powers over the previous hundred years, highlighting the abilities of the PLA and the Chinese Communist Party. The Korean war cemented China's relationship with the USSR for some time, making it more dependent on the Soviet Union for development aid and technology, while limiting cooperation between China and the US. A high proportion of government expenditures were needed for the war and this slowed China's reconstruction. The most significant negative long-term consequence of the war for China was that it led the United States to guarantee the safety of Chiang Kaishek's regime in Taiwan, effectively ensuring that Taiwan would remain outside of PRC control through the present day. Anti-U.S. sentiments, which were already a significant factor during the Chinese Civil War, were ingrained into Chinese culture during the communist propaganda campaigns of the Korean War.\nThe Korean War affected other participant combatants. Turkey, for example, entered NATO in 1952, and the foundation was laid for bilateral diplomatic and trade relations with South Korea. The war also played a role in the refugee crisis in Turkey in 1950\u20131951.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWar memorials.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He held the position until the dissolution of the Flensburg Government following Germany's unconditional surrender to the Allies weeks later. As Supreme Commander of the Navy beginning in 1943, he played a major role in the naval history of the war.\nHe began his career in the Imperial German Navy before the First World War. In 1918 he was commanding , and was captured as a prisoner of war by British forces. As commander of \"UB-68\", he attacked a convoy in the Mediterranean while on patrol near Malta. Sinking one ship before the rest of the convoy outran his U-boat, D\u00f6nitz began to formulate the concept of U-boats operating in attack groups \"Rudeltaktik\" (German for \"pack tactic\", commonly called a \"wolfpack\") for greater efficiency, rather than operating independently.\nBy the start of the Second World War, D\u00f6nitz was supreme commander of the \"Kriegsmarine\"'s U-boat arm ( [BdU]). In January 1943 he achieved the rank of (grand admiral) and replaced Grand Admiral Erich Raeder as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. He was the main enemy of Allied naval forces in the Battle of the Atlantic. From 1939 to 1943 the U-boats fought effectively but lost the initiative from May 1943. He ordered his submarines into battle until 1945 to relieve the pressure on other branches of the (armed forces). 648 U-boats were lost\u2014429 with no survivors. Furthermore, of these, 215 were lost on their first patrol. Around 30,000 of the 40,000 men who served in U-boats perished.\nOn 30 April 1945, following the suicide of Adolf Hitler and in accordance with his last will and testament, D\u00f6nitz was named Hitler's successor as head of state in what became known as the Goebbels cabinet after his second-in-command, Joseph Goebbels, until Goebbels's suicide led to D\u00f6nitz's cabinet being reformed into the Flensburg Government instead. On 7 May 1945, he ordered Alfred Jodl, Chief of Operations Staff of the Armed Forces High Command (German: (OKW)), to sign the German Instrument of Surrender in Reims, France, formally ending the War in Europe. D\u00f6nitz remained as head of state with the titles of President of Germany and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces until his cabinet was dissolved by the Allied powers on 23 May \"de facto\" and on 5 June \"de jure\".\nBy his own admission, D\u00f6nitz was a dedicated Nazi and supporter of Hitler. Following the war, he was indicted as a major war criminal at the Nuremberg trials on three counts: conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity; planning, initiating, and waging wars of aggression; and crimes against the laws of war. He was found not guilty of committing crimes against humanity, but guilty of committing crimes against peace and war crimes against the laws of war. He was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment; following his release, he lived in a village near Hamburg until his death in late December 1980.\nEarly career and personal life.\nD\u00f6nitz was born on 16 September 1891 in Gr\u00fcnau, near Berlin, to Anna Beyer and Emil D\u00f6nitz, an engineer. Karl had an older brother. In 1910, D\u00f6nitz enlisted in the (\"Imperial Navy\").\nOn 27 September 1913, D\u00f6nitz was commissioned as a (acting sub-lieutenant). When World War I began, he served on the light cruiser in the Mediterranean Sea. In August 1914, the \"Breslau\" and the battlecruiser were sold to the Ottoman Navy; the ships were renamed the \"Midilli\" and the \"Yavuz Sultan Selim\", respectively. They began operating out of Constantinople, under Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, engaging Russian forces in the Black Sea. On 22 March 1916, D\u00f6nitz was promoted to . He requested a transfer to the submarine forces, which became effective on 1 October 1916. He attended the submariner's school at Flensburg-M\u00fcrwik and passed out on 3 January 1917. He served as watch officer on , and from February 1918 onward as commander of . On 2 July 1918, he became commander of , operating in the Mediterranean. On 4 October, after suffering technical difficulties, D\u00f6nitz was forced to surface and scuttled his boat. He was captured by the British and incarcerated in the Redmires camp near Sheffield. He remained a prisoner of war until 1919 and in 1920 he returned to Germany.\nOn 27 May 1916, D\u00f6nitz married a nurse named Ingeborg Weber (1893\u20131962), the daughter of the German general Erich Weber (1860\u20131933). They had three children, whom they raised as Protestant Christians: a daughter named Ursula (1917\u20131990) and their sons Klaus (1920\u20131944) and Peter (1922\u20131943).\nBoth of D\u00f6nitz's sons were killed in action during the Second World War. Peter was killed on 19 May 1943 when was sunk in the North Atlantic with all hands. Hitler had issued a policy stating that if a senior officer such as D\u00f6nitz lost a son in battle and had other sons in the military, the latter could withdraw from combat and return to civilian life. After Peter's death, Klaus was forbidden to have any combat role and was allowed to leave the military to begin studying to become a naval doctor. However, on 13 May 1944, his 24th birthday, he persuaded his friends to let him go on the E-boat \"S-141\" for a raid on Selsey. The boat was sunk by the and Klaus was killed.\nInterwar period.\nHe continued his naval career in the naval arm of the Weimar Republic's armed forces. On 10 January 1921, he became a (lieutenant) in the new German navy (). D\u00f6nitz commanded torpedo boats, becoming a (lieutenant-commander) on 1 November 1928. On 1 September 1933, he became a (commander) and, in 1934, was put in command of the cruiser \"Emden\", the ship on which cadets and midshipmen took a year-long world cruise as training.\nIn 1935, the was renamed . Germany was prohibited by the Treaty of Versailles from possessing a submarine fleet. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 allowed submarines and he was placed in command of the U-boat flotilla , which comprised three boats; ; and; . On 1 September 1935, he was promoted to (naval captain).\nD\u00f6nitz opposed Raeder's views that surface ships should be given priority in the during the war, but in 1935 D\u00f6nitz doubted U-boat suitability in a naval trade war on account of their slow speed. This phenomenal contrast with D\u00f6nitz's wartime policy is explained in the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement. The accord was viewed by the navy with optimism, D\u00f6nitz included. He remarked, \"Britain, in the circumstances, could not possibly be included in the number of potential enemies.\" The statement, made after June 1935, was uttered at a time when the naval staff were sure France and the Soviet Union were likely to be Germany's only enemies. D\u00f6nitz's statement was partially correct. Britain was not foreseen as an immediate enemy, but the navy still held onto a cadre of imperial officers, which along with its Nazi-instigated intake, understood war would be certain in the distant future, perhaps not until the mid-1940s.\nD\u00f6nitz came to recognise the need for more of these vessels. Only 26 were in commission or under construction that summer. In the time before his command of submarines, he perfected the group tactics that first appealed to him in 1917. At this time D\u00f6nitz first expressed his procurement policies. His preference for the submarine fleet was in the production of large numbers of small craft. In contrast to other warships, the fighting power of the U-boat, in his opinion, was not dependent on its size as the torpedo, not the gun, was the machine's main weapon. D\u00f6nitz had a tendency to be critical of larger submarines and listed a number of disadvantages in their production, operation and tactical use. D\u00f6nitz recommended the Type VII submarine as the ideal submarine. The boat was reliable and had a range of . Modifications lengthened this to .\nD\u00f6nitz revived Hermann Bauer's idea of grouping several submarines together into a (\"pack tactic\", commonly called \"wolfpack\") to overwhelm a merchant convoy's escorts. Implementation of wolfpacks had been difficult in World War I owing to the limitations of available radios. In the interwar years, Germany had developed ultra high frequency transmitters, while the Enigma cipher machine was believed to have made communications secure. A 1922 paper written by Wessner of the (Defence Ministry) pointed to the success of surface attacks at night and the need to coordinate operations with multiple boats to defeat the escorts. D\u00f6nitz knew of the paper and improved the ideas suggested by Wessner. This tactic had the added advantage that a submarine on the surface was undetectable by ASDIC (an early form of sonar). D\u00f6nitz claimed after the war he would not allow his service to be intimidated by British disclosures about ASDIC and the course of the war had proven him right. In reality, D\u00f6nitz harboured fears stretching back to 1937 that the new technology would render the U-boat impotent. D\u00f6nitz published his ideas on night attacks in January 1939 in a booklet called which apparently went unnoticed by the British. The Royal Navy's overconfidence in ASDIC encouraged the Admiralty to suppose it could deal with submarines whatever strategy they adopted \u2014 in this they were proven wrong; submarines were difficult to locate and destroy under operational conditions.\nIn 1939 he expressed his belief that he could win the war with 300 vessels. The Nazi leadership's rearmament programme prioritised land and aerial warfare. From 1933 to 1936, the navy was granted only 13 per cent of total armament expenditure. The production of U-boats, despite the existing Z Plan, remained low. In 1935 shipyards produced 14 submarines, 21 in 1936, 1 in 1937. In 1938 nine were commissioned and in 1939 18 U-boats were built. D\u00f6nitz's vision may have been misguided. The British had planned for contingency construction programmes for the summer, 1939. At least 78 small escorts and a crash construction programme of \"Whale catchers\" had been invoked. The British, according to one historian, had taken all the sensible steps necessary to deal with the U-boat menace as it existed in 1939 and were well placed to deal with large numbers of submarines, prior to events in 1940.\nWorld War II.\nOn 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. Britain and France soon declared war on Germany, and World War II began. On Sunday 3 September, D\u00f6nitz chaired a conference at Wilhelmshaven. At 11:15\u00a0am the British Admiralty sent out a signal \"Total Germany\". B-Dienst intercepted the message and it was promptly reported to D\u00f6nitz. D\u00f6nitz paced around the room and his staff purportedly heard him repeatedly say, \"My God! So it's war with England again!\"\nD\u00f6nitz abandoned the conference to return within the hour a far more composed man. He announced to his officers, \"we know our enemy. We have today the weapon and a leadership that can face up to this enemy. The war will last a long time; but if each does his duty we will win.\" D\u00f6nitz had only 57 boats; of those, 27 were capable of reaching the Atlantic Ocean from their German bases. A small building program was already under way but the number of U-boats did not rise noticeably until the autumn of 1941.\nD\u00f6nitz's first major action was the cover up of the sinking of the British passenger liner \"Athenia\" later the same day. Acutely sensitive to international opinion and relations with the United States, the death of more than a hundred civilians was damaging. D\u00f6nitz suppressed the truth that the ship was sunk by a German submarine. He accepted the commander's explanation that he genuinely believed the ship was armed. D\u00f6nitz ordered the engagement to be struck from the submarine's logbook. D\u00f6nitz did not admit the cover up until 1946.\nHitler's original orders to wage war only in accordance with the Prize Regulations were not issued in any altruistic spirit but in the belief hostilities with the Western Allies would be brief. On 23 September 1939, Hitler, on the recommendation of Raeder, approved an order that all merchant ships making use of their wireless upon being stopped by U-boats should be sunk or captured. This order marked a considerable step towards unrestricted warfare. Four days later enforcement of Prize Regulations in the North Sea was withdrawn; and on 2 October complete freedom was given to attack darkened ships encountered off the British and French coasts. Two days later the Prize Regulations were cancelled in waters extending as far as 15\u00b0 West, and on 17 October the German Naval Staff gave U-boats permission to attack without warning all ships identified as hostile. The zone where darkened ships could be attacked with complete freedom was extended to 20\u00b0 West on 19 October. Practically the only restrictions now placed on U-boats concerned attacks on passenger liners and, on 17 November, they too were allowed to be attacked without warning if clearly identifiable as hostile.\nAlthough the phrase was not used, by November 1939 the BdU was practicing unrestricted submarine warfare. Neutral shipping was warned by the Germans against entering the zone which, by American neutrality legislation, was forbidden to American shipping, and against steaming without lights, zigzagging or taking any defensive precautions. The complete practice of unrestricted warfare was not enforced for fear of antagonising neutral powers, particularly the Americans. Admirals Raeder and D\u00f6nitz and the German Naval Staff had always wished and intended to introduce unrestricted warfare as rapidly as Hitler could be persuaded to accept the possible consequences.\nD\u00f6nitz and Raeder accepted the death of the Z Plan upon the outbreak of war. The U-boat programme would be the only portion of it to survive 1939. Both men lobbied Hitler to increase the planned production of submarines to at least 29 per month. The immediate obstacle to the proposals was Hermann G\u00f6ring, head of the Four Year Plan, commander-in-chief of the \"Luftwaffe\" and future successor to Hitler. G\u00f6ring would not acquiesce and in March 1940 Raeder was forced to drop the figure from 29 to 25, but even that plan proved illusory. In the first half of 1940, two boats were delivered, increased to six in the final half of the year. In 1941 the deliveries increased to 13 to June, and then 20 to December. It was not until late 1941 the number of vessels began to increase quickly. From September 1939 through to March 1940, 15 U-boats were lost\u2014nine to convoy escorts. The impressive tonnage sunk had little impact on the Allied war effort at that point.\nCommander of the submarine fleet.\nOn 1 October 1939, D\u00f6nitz became a (rear admiral) and \"Commander of the Submarines\" (, \"BdU\"). For the first part of the war, despite disagreements with Raeder where best to deploy his men, D\u00f6nitz was given considerable operational freedom for his junior rank.\nFrom September until December 1939, U-boats sank 221 ships for 755,237 gross tons, at the cost of nine U-boats. Only 47 merchant ships were sunk in the North Atlantic, a tonnage of 249,195. D\u00f6nitz had difficulty in organising Wolfpack operations in 1939. A number of his submarines were lost en route to the Atlantic, through either the North Sea or the heavily defended English Channel. Torpedo failures plagued commanders during convoy attacks. Along with successes against single ships, D\u00f6nitz authorised the abandonment of pack attacks in the autumn. The Norwegian campaign amplified the defects. D\u00f6nitz wrote in May 1940, \"I doubt whether men have ever had to rely on such a useless weapon.\" He ordered the removal of magnetic pistols in favour of contact fuses and their faulty depth control systems. In no fewer than 40 attacks on Allied warships, not a single sinking was achieved. The statistics show that from the outbreak of war to approximately the spring of 1940, faulty German torpedoes saved 50\u201360 ships equating to \u00a0GRT.\nD\u00f6nitz was encouraged in operations against warships by the sinking of the aircraft carrier \"Courageous\". On 28 September 1939 he said, \"it is not true Britain possesses the means to eliminate the U-boat menace.\" The first specific operation\u2014named \"Special Operation P\"\u2014authorised by D\u00f6nitz was G\u00fcnther Prien's attack on Scapa Flow, which sank the battleship \"Royal Oak\". The attack became a propaganda success though Prien purportedly was unenthusiastic about being used that way. Historian Stephen Roskill wrote, \"It is now known that this operation was planned with great care by Admiral D\u00f6nitz, who was correctly informed of the weak state of the defences of the eastern entrances. Full credit must also be given to Lieutenant Prien for the nerve and determination with which he put D\u00f6nitz's plan into execution.\"\nIn May 1940, 101 ships were sunk\u2014but only nine in the Atlantic\u2014followed by 140 in June; 53 of them in the Atlantic for a total of \u00a0GRT that month. The first six months in 1940 cost D\u00f6nitz 15 U-boats. Until mid-1940 there remained a chronic problem with the reliability of the G7e torpedo. As the battles of Norway and Western Europe raged, the \"Luftwaffe\" sank more ships than the U-boats. In May 1940, German aircraft sank 48 ships (\u00a0GRT), three times that of German submarines. The Allied evacuations from western Europe and Scandinavia in June 1940 attracted Allied warships in large numbers, leaving many of the Atlantic convoys travelling through the Western Approaches unprotected. From June 1940, the German submarines began to exact a heavy toll. In the same month, the \"Luftwaffe\" sank just 22 ships (\u00a0GRT) in a reversal of the previous months.\nGermany's defeat of Norway gave the U-boats new bases much nearer to their main area of operations off the Western Approaches. The U-boats operated in groups or 'wolf packs' which were coordinated by radio from land. With the fall of France, Germany acquired U-boat bases at Lorient, Brest, Saint-Nazaire, La Pallice/La Rochelle and Bordeaux. This extended the range of Type VIIs. Regardless, the war with Britain continued. The admiral remained sceptical of Operation Sea Lion, a planned invasion and expected a long war. The destruction of seaborne trade became German strategy against Britain after the defeat of the \"Luftwaffe\" in the Battle of Britain. Hitler was content with the Blitz and cutting off Britain's imports. D\u00f6nitz gained importance as the prospect of a quick victory faded. D\u00f6nitz concentrated groups of U-boats against the convoys and had them attack on the surface at night. In addition the Germans were helped by Italian submarines which in early 1941 actually surpassed the number of German U-boats. Having failed to persuade the Nazi leadership to prioritise U-boat construction, a task made more difficult by military victories in 1940 which convinced many people that Britain would give up the struggle, D\u00f6nitz welcomed the deployment of 26 Italian submarines to his force. D\u00f6nitz complimented Italian bravery and daring, but was critical of their training and submarine designs. D\u00f6nitz remarked they lacked the necessary toughness and discipline and consequently were \"of no great assistance to us in the Atlantic.\"\nThe establishment of German bases on the French Atlantic coast allowed for the prospect of aerial support. Small numbers of German aircraft, such as the long-range Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor, sank a large number of ships in the Atlantic in the last quarter of 1940. In the long term, G\u00f6ring proved an insurmountable problem in effecting cooperation between the navy and the \"Luftwaffe\". In early 1941, while G\u00f6ring was on leave, D\u00f6nitz approached Hitler and secured from him a single bomber/maritime patrol unit for the navy. G\u00f6ring succeeded in overturning this decision and both D\u00f6nitz and Raeder were forced to settle for a specialist maritime air command under \"Luftwaffe\" control. Poorly supplied, achieved modest success in 1941, but thereafter failed to have an impact as British counter-measures evolved. Cooperation between the and remained dysfunctional to the war's end. G\u00f6ring and his unassailable position at the (Air Ministry) prevented all but limited collaboration.\nThe U-boat fleet's successes in 1940 and early 1941 were spearheaded by a small number of highly trained and experienced pre-war commanders. Otto Kretschmer, Joachim Schepke, and G\u00fcnther Prien were the most famous, but others included Hans Jenisch, Victor Oehrn, Engelbert Endrass, Herbert Schultze and Hans-Rudolf R\u00f6sing. Although they were skilled and had impeccable judgement, the shipping lanes they descended upon were poorly defended. The U-boat force did not escape unscathed. Within the space of several days in March 1941, Prien and Schepke were dead and Kretschmer was a prisoner. All of them fell in battle with a convoy system. The number of boats in the Atlantic remained low. Six fewer existed in May 1940 than in September 1939. In January 1941 there were just six on station in the Atlantic\u2014the lowest during the war, while still suffering from unreliable torpedoes. D\u00f6nitz insisted that operations continue while \"the smallest prospect of hits\" remained.\nFor his part, D\u00f6nitz was involved in the daily operations of his boats and all the major operational level decisions. His assistant, Eberhard Godt, was left to manage daily operations as the war continued. D\u00f6nitz was debriefed personally by his captains which helped establish a rapport between leader and led. D\u00f6nitz neglected nothing that would make the bond firmer. Often there would be a distribution of medals or awards. As an ex-submariner, D\u00f6nitz did not like to contemplate the thought of a man who had done well heading out to sea, perhaps never to return, without being rewarded or receiving recognition. D\u00f6nitz acknowledged where decorations were concerned there was no red tape and that awards were \"psychologically important\".\nIntelligence battle.\nIntelligence played an important role in the Battle of the Atlantic. In general, BdU intelligence was poor. Counter-intelligence was not much better. At the height of the battle in mid-1943 some 2,000 signals were sent from the 110 U-boats at sea. Radio traffic compromised his ciphers by giving the Allies more messages to work with. Furthermore, replies from the boats enabled the Allies to use High-frequency direction finding (HF/DF, called \"Huff-Duff\") to locate a U-boat using its radio, track it and attack it. The over-centralised command structure of BdU and its insistence on micro-managing every aspect of U-boat operations with endless signals provided the Allied navies with ample intelligence. The enormous \"paper chase\" [cross-referencing of materials] operations pursued by Allied intelligence agencies was not thought possible by BdU. The Germans did not suspect the Allies had identified the codes broken by B-Dienst. Conversely, when D\u00f6nitz suspected the enemy had penetrated his own communications BdU's response was to suspect internal sabotage and reduce the number of the staff officers to the most reliable, exacerbating the problem of over-centralisation. In contrast to the Allies, the was suspicious of civilian scientific advisors and generally distrusted outsiders. The Germans were never as open to new ideas or thinking of war in intelligence terms. According to one analyst BdU \"lacked imagination and intellectual daring\" in the naval war. These Allied advantages failed to avert heavy losses in the June 1940 to May 1941 period, known to U-boat crews as the \"First Happy Time.\" In June 1941, 68 ships were sunk in the North Atlantic (\u00a0GRT) at a cost of four U-boats, but the German submarines would not eclipse that number for the remainder of the year. Just 10 transports were sunk in November and December 1941.\nOn 7 May 1941, the Royal Navy captured the German Arctic meteorological vessel and took its Enigma machine intact, which allowed the Royal Navy to decode U-boat radio communications in June 1941. Two days later the capture of \"U-110\" was an intelligence coup for the British. The settings for high-level \"officer-only\" signals, \"short-signals\" () and codes standardising messages to defeat HF/DF fixes by sheer speed were found. Only the \"Hydra\" settings for May were missing. The papers were the only stores destroyed by the crew. The capture on 28 June of another weather ship, , enabled British decryption operations to read radio traffic in July 1941. Beginning in August 1941, Bletchley Park operatives could decrypt signals between D\u00f6nitz and his U-boats at sea without any restriction. The capture of the \"U-110\" allowed the Admiralty to identify individual boats, their commanders, operational readiness, damage reports, location, type, speed, endurance from working up in the Baltic to Atlantic patrols. On 1 February 1942, the Germans had introduced the M4 cipher machine, which secured communications until it was cracked in December 1942. Even so, the U-boats achieved their best success against the convoys in March 1943, due to an increase in U-boat numbers, and the protection of the shipping lanes was in jeopardy. Due to the cracked M4 and the use of radar, the Allies began to send air and surface reinforcements to convoys under threat. The shipping lanes were secured, which came as a great surprise to D\u00f6nitz. The lack of intelligence and increased numbers of U-boats contributed enormously to Allied losses that year.\nSignals security aroused D\u00f6nitz's suspicions during the war. On 12 January 1942 German supply submarine \"U-459\" arrived 800 nautical miles west of Freetown, well clear of convoy lanes. It was scheduled to rendezvous with an Italian submarine, until intercepted by a warship. The German captain's report coincided with reports of a decrease in sightings and a period of tension between D\u00f6nitz and Raeder. The number of U-boats in the Atlantic, by logic, should have increased, not lowered the number of sightings and the reasons for this made D\u00f6nitz uneasy. Despite several investigations, the conclusion of the BdU staff was that \"Enigma\" was impenetrable. His signals officer responded to the \"U-459\" incident with answers ranging from coincidence, direction finding, to Italian treachery. General Erich Fellgiebel, Chief Signal Officer of Army High Command and of Supreme Command of Armed Forces (), apparently concurred with D\u00f6nitz. He concluded that there was \"convincing evidence\" that, after an \"exhaustive investigation\" that the Allied codebreakers had been reading high level communications. Other departments in the navy downplayed or dismissed these concerns. They vaguely implied \"some components\" of Enigma had been compromised, but there was \"no real basis for acute anxiety as regards any compromise of operational security\".\nAmerican entry.\nFollowing Germany's declaration of war on the United States on 11 December 1941, D\u00f6nitz implemented Operation Drumbeat (). The entry of the United States benefited German submarines in the short term. D\u00f6nitz intended to strike close to shore in American and Canadian waters and prevent the convoys\u2014the most effective anti\u2013U-boat system\u2014from ever forming. D\u00f6nitz was determined to take advantage of Canadian and American unpreparedness before the situation changed.\nThe problem inhibiting D\u00f6nitz's plan was a lack of boats. On paper he had 259, but in January 1942, 99 were still undergoing sea trials and 59 were assigned to training flotillas, leaving only 101 on war operations. 35 of these were under repair in port, leaving 66 operational, of which 18 were low on fuel and returning to base, 23 were en route to areas where fuel and torpedoes needed to be conserved, and one was heading to the Mediterranean. Therefore, on 1 January D\u00f6nitz had a fighting strength of 16\u201325 in the Atlantic (six of them close to Iceland on \"Norwegian operations\"), three in the Arctic Ocean, three in the Mediterranean and three operating west of Gibraltar. D\u00f6nitz was severely limited to what he could accomplish in American waters in an initial offensive.\nFrom 13 January 1942, D\u00f6nitz planned to begin a surprise offensive from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Cape Hatteras. Unknown to him, Ultra had read his Enigma signals and knew the position, size, and intentions of his boats, down to the date the operation was scheduled to begin. The attacks, when they came, were not a surprise. Of the 12 U-boats that began the offensive from the Grand Banks southward, just two survived the war. The operation began the Battle of the St. Lawrence, a series of battles which lasted into 1944. It remained possible for a U-boat to operate in the Gulf into 1944, but countermeasures were strong. In 1942, the global ratio of ships-to-U-boats sunk in Canadian waters was 112:1. The global average was 10.3:1. The solitary kill was achieved by the RCAF. Canadian operations, as with American efforts, were a failure during this year.\nAlong with conventional U-boat operations D\u00f6nitz authorised clandestine activities in Canadian waters, including spying, mine-laying, and recovery of German prisoners of war (as D\u00f6nitz wished to extract information from rescued submariners concerning Allied tactics). All of these things tied down Canadian military power and imposed industrial, fiscal, and psychological costs. The impunity with which U-boats carried out these operations in Canadian waters into 1944 provided a propaganda effect. One of these operations was the well-known Operation Kiebitz to rescue Otto Kretschmer.\nEven with operational problems great success was achieved in American waters. From January to July 1942, D\u00f6nitz's submarines were able to attack unescorted ships off the United States' east coast and in the Caribbean Sea; U-boats sank more ships and tonnage than at any other time in the war. After a convoy system was introduced to protect the shipping, D\u00f6nitz shifted his U-boats back to the North Atlantic. The period, known in the U-boat Arm as the \"Second Happy Time\", represented one of the greatest naval disasters of all time, and largest defeat suffered by American sea power. The success was achieved with only five U-boats initially which sank 397 ships in waters protected by the United States Navy with an additional 23 sunk at the Panama Sea Frontier. D\u00f6nitz put the successes down to the American failure to initialise a blackout along the East Coast of the United States and ship captains' insistence on following peace-time safety procedures. The failure to implement a blackout stemmed from the American government's concern it would affect the tourism trade. D\u00f6nitz wrote in his memoirs that the lighthouses and buoys \"shone forth, though perhaps a little less brightly than usually\".\nBy the time improved American air and naval defences had driven German submarines from American shores, 5,000 Allied sailors had been killed for negligible losses in U-boats. D\u00f6nitz ordered simultaneous operations in the Caribbean Sea. The ensuing Battle of the Caribbean resulted in immediate dividends for U-boats. In a short time, at least 100 transports had been destroyed or sunk. The sinkings damaged inter-island trade substantially. Operation Neuland was among the most damaging naval campaigns in the region. Oil refinery production in region declined while the tanker fleet suffered losses of up to ten per cent within twenty-four hours. However, ultimately D\u00f6nitz could not hope to sink more ships than American industry could build, so he targeted the tanker fleet in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the hope that depleting oil transports would paralyse shipyard output. 33 transports were sunk in July before D\u00f6nitz lost his first crew. The USN introduced effective convoy systems thereafter, ending the \"carnage\".\nD\u00f6nitz maintained his demands for the concentration of all his crews in the Atlantic. As the military situation in North Africa and on the Eastern Front began to deteriorate Hitler diverted a number of submarines to the Battle of the Mediterranean upon the suggestions of Admiral Eberhard Weichold. Raeder and D\u00f6nitz resisted the deployment to the Mediterranean to no avail. Hitler felt compelled to act against Allied sea forces which were having an enormous impact on Axis supply lines to North Africa. The decision defied logic, for a victory in the Atlantic would end the war in the Mediterranean. The U-boat war in the Mediterranean was a costly failure, despite successes against warships. Approximately 60 crews were lost and only one crew managed to withdraw through the Strait of Gibraltar. Albrecht Brandi was one of D\u00f6nitz's highest performers but his record is a matter of controversy; post-war records prove systematic over-claiming of sinkings. He survived his boat's sinking and was smuggled to Germany through Spain. D\u00f6nitz had met his end as a submarine commander in the Mediterranean two decades earlier.\nIn 1942 D\u00f6nitz summed up his philosophy in one simple paragraph; \"The enemy's shipping constitutes one single, great entity. It is therefore immaterial where a ship is sunk. Once it has been destroyed it has to be replaced by a new ship; and that's that.\" The remark was the green light to unrestricted submarine warfare and began the tonnage war proper. BdU intelligence concluded the Americans could produce 15,300,000 tons of shipping in 1942 and 1943\u2014two million tons under actual production figures. D\u00f6nitz always calculated the worst-case scenario using the highest figures of enemy production potential. Some 700,000 tons per month needed to be sunk to win the war. The \"second happy time\" reached a peak in June 1942, with 325,000 tons sunk, up from 311,000 in May, 255,000 in April and the highest since the 327,000 tons sunk in March 1942. With support from the Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy, the new convoy systems compelled D\u00f6nitz to withdraw his captains to the mid-Atlantic once again. Nevertheless, there was still cause for optimism. B-Dienst had cracked the convoy ciphers and by July 1942 D\u00f6nitz could call upon 311 boats, 140 operational, to conduct a renewed assault. By October 1942 he had 196 operational from 365. D\u00f6nitz's force finally reached the desired number both he and Raeder had hoped for in 1939. Unaware of it, D\u00f6nitz and his men were aided by the Ultra blackout. The addition of a fourth rotor to the Enigma left radio detection the only way to gather intelligence on dispositions and intentions of the German naval forces. German code breakers had their own success in the capture of the code book to Cipher Code Number 3 from a merchant ship. It was a treble success for the BdU.\nD\u00f6nitz was content that he now had the naval power to extend U-boat operations to other areas aside the North Atlantic. The Caribbean, Brazilian waters with the coast of West Africa designated operational theatres. Waters in the southern hemisphere to South Africa could also be attacked with the new Type IX submarine. The strategy was sound and his tactical ideas were effective. The number of boats available allowed him to form Wolfpacks to comb convoy routes from east to west attacking one when found and pursuing it across the ocean. The pack then refuelled from a U-boat tanker and worked from west to east. Raeder and the operations staff disputed the value in attacking convoys heading westward with empty cargo holds. The tactics were successful but placed great strain on crews who spent up to eight days in constant action.\nNovember 1942 was a new high in the Atlantic. 134 ships were sunk for 807,754 tons. 119 were destroyed by submarines, 83 (508,707 tons) in the Atlantic. The same month D\u00f6nitz suffered strategic defeat. His submarines failed to prevent Operation Torch, even with 196 of them operating in the Atlantic. D\u00f6nitz considered it a major self-inflicted defeat. Allied morale radically improved after the victories of Torch, the Second Battle of El Alamein and the Battle of Stalingrad; all occurred within days of one another. The U-boat war was the only military success the Germans enjoyed at the end of the year.\nCommander-in-chief and Grand Admiral.\nOn 30 January 1943, D\u00f6nitz replaced Erich Raeder as Commander-in-chief of the navy () and (grand admiral) of the Naval High Command (). In a communique to the navy he announced his intentions to retain practical control of the U-boats and his desire to fight to the end for Hitler. D\u00f6nitz's inability to delegate control of the U-boat service has been construed as a weakness in the U-boat arm, contributing to the perception that D\u00f6nitz was an \"impatient warrior\", preoccupied with fighting battles and tactics rather than a strategist or organiser.\nD\u00f6nitz's promotion earned Hitler his undying loyalty. For D\u00f6nitz, Hitler had given him a \"true home-coming at last, to a country in which unemployment appeared to have been abolished, the class war no longer tore the nation apart, and the shame of defeat in 1918 was being expunged.\" When war came, D\u00f6nitz became more firmly wedded to his Nazi faith. Hitler recognised his patriotism, professionalism but above all, his loyalty. D\u00f6nitz remained so, long after the war was lost. In so doing, he wilfully ignored the genocidal nature of the regime and claimed ignorance of The Holocaust.\nIn the last quarter of 1942, 69 submarines had been commissioned taking the total number to 393, with 212 operational. D\u00f6nitz was not satisfied and immediately began a naval construction programme which in contrast to Raeder's, laid all its emphasis on torpedo boats and submarines. D\u00f6nitz's proposed expansion ran into difficulties experienced by all of his predecessors; the lack of steel. The navy had no representation on Albert Speer's armaments ministry, for naval production was the only sphere not under his control. D\u00f6nitz understood this worked against the navy because it lacked the elasticity to cope with breakdowns of production at any point, whereas the other services could make good production by compensating one sector at the expense of another. Without any representatives the battle of priorities was left to Speer and G\u00f6ring. D\u00f6nitz had the sense to place U-boat production under Speer on the provision 40 per month were completed. D\u00f6nitz persuaded Hitler not to scrap the surface fleet capital ships, though they played no role in the Atlantic during his time in command. D\u00f6nitz reasoned the destruction of the surface fleet would provide the British with a victory and heap pressure on the U-boats, for these warships were tying down British air and naval forces that would otherwise be sent into the Atlantic.\nNew construction procedures, dispensing with prototypes and the abandonment of modifications reduced construction times from 460,000-man hours to 260\u2013300,000 to meet Speer's quota. In the spring 1944, the Type XXI submarine was scheduled to reach frontline units. In 1943 the Combined Bomber Offensive undid German plans. D\u00f6nitz and Speer were appalled by the destruction of Hamburg, a major construction site. The battles of 1943 and 1944 were fought with the existing Type VII and Type IX submarines. The Type VII remained the backbone of the fleet in 1943.\nAt the end of 1942, D\u00f6nitz was faced with the appearance of escort carriers, and long-range aircraft working with convoy escorts. To protect his boats against the latter, he ordered his boats to restrict their operations to the Mid-Atlantic Gap, a stretch of ocean out of the range of land-based aircraft. Allied air forces had few aircraft equipped with ASV radar for U-boat detection into April and May 1943, and such units would not exist in Newfoundland until June. Convoys relied on RAF Coastal Command aircraft operating from Northern Ireland and Iceland. The aircraft imposed restraints on U-boat captains, who feared them for their ability to sink a submarine or alert surface warships to their position. In 1942 Coastal Command began forming units combined with ASV and Leigh Light to attack U-boats at night in transit to the Atlantic via the Bay of Biscay, which continued into 1943. The Command was moderately successful after mid-1942.\n1943 began with continued tactical success for D\u00f6nitz in battle. In January Convoy TM 1 was nearly destroyed. The loss of 100,000 tons of fuel in one convoy represented the most devastating loss percentage of the war\u2014only two of nine tankers reached port. The Eighth Army were forced to ration their fuel for a time, earning D\u00f6nitz the gratitude of the \"Afrika Korps\". The Casablanca Conference, held that month, identified the Atlantic as the priority. It was agreed that until the defeat of D\u00f6nitz and his men, there could be no amphibious landings in continental Europe. Unknown to D\u00f6nitz, Bletchley Park had broken the Shark cypher and restored the flow of Enigma information; the Admiralty was able to route convoys around wolfpacks. During January and February 1943 information was decrypted within 24 hours proving operationally useful, although this slipped at the end of the second month contributing to German interceptions. Even so, in appalling weather, the Germans sank only 44 ships during the month, even with 100 U-boats at sea, the majority stationed in the mid-Atlantic gap.\nIn February 1943 the strength of Allied defences were ominous for D\u00f6nitz. The battle of convoy HX 224 was ended upon the intervention of air power from Iceland. D\u00f6nitz sent 20 boats to attack SC 118 and both sides suffered heavy losses\u201411 merchant ships for three U-boats plus four damaged. It was \"what both sides considered one of the hardest fought battles of the Atlantic war\". Despite sending 20 crews into action, D\u00f6nitz was concerned that most captains did not press home attacks. The majority of the ships sunk were by one crew, commanded by Siegfried von Forstner\u2014he sank seven.\nIn March, Convoy SC 121 was attacked by 31 U-boats in two patrol lines. It was the most successful battle of the war for D\u00f6nitz. The battle of Convoys HX 229/SC 122 was the largest convoy battle, with 40 U-boats involved. Each operation was successful but all were fought in the mid-Atlantic. Allied losses reached a peak in March 1943. The Admiralty later issued a report on the matter; \"The Germans never came so near [to] disrupting communications between the new world and the old as in the first twenty days of March 1943.\" D\u00f6nitz later conceded the March battles were to be the U-boats' last victories. New Allied techniques, tactics and technology began to turn the tide. By April 1943 U-boat morale was reaching a crisis point. Ninety-eight new boats were sent into the Atlantic that month and although the training was thorough the crews were inexperienced and it showed. Fifteen U-boats were destroyed in March 1943 and another 15 in April. Werner Hartenstein and Johann Mohr were notable casualties over the course of these eight weeks; the former's decision to rescue survivors of a sunken ship led to D\u00f6nitz's Laconia Order, which later formed part of the criminal case against D\u00f6nitz.\nOminous for BdU was the sudden growth of Allied air power. The Allied command accepted that air cover over the mid-Atlantic was inadequate and had drawn attention to the fact that not one VLR (Very Long Range) aircraft was to be found at any Allied air base west of Iceland. The Americans released 255 Liberators for the North Atlantic. At the end of March 1943 20 VLR aircraft were operational rising to 41 by mid-April, all of them flown by British crews. Twenty-eight anti-submarine and 11 anti-shipping squadrons were available to RAF Coastal Command, 619 aircraft in all\u2014a striking change since September 1939. The influx of radar equipped aircraft into mid-Atlantic was matched by air patrols over the Bay of Biscay. D\u00f6nitz detected a drop in morale among his captains, as did the British. D\u00f6nitz encouraged his commanders to show a \"hunter's instinct\" and \"warrior spirit\" in the face of the air\u2013surface support group threat.\nAlong with air power, the BdU was forced to contend with a large increase in Allied convoy escorts which fuelled from tankers in the convoys allowing escort across the ocean. The escort carrier support groups, protected by destroyers, which, in the words of the official naval historian of the Second World War, proved decisive; \"it was the advent of the Support Groups, the Escort Carriers and the Very Long Range Aircraft which turned the tables on the U-boats-and did so with astonishing rapidity\".\nOne hundred eight ships were sunk in the first 20 days of March, and just 15 in the last 10. The official naval historian wrote, \"The collapse of the enemy's offensive, when it came, was so sudden that it took him completely by surprise. We now know that, in fact, a downward trend in the U-boats' recent accomplishments could have forewarned him, but was concealed from him by the exaggerated claims made by their commanders.\" In April D\u00f6nitz lost five crews to the Coastal Command ASV Biscay offensive. Encouraged by the isolated successes of anti-aircraft artillery installed on submarines, he ordered crews to stay on the surface and fight it out with the aircraft. The decision caused casualties\u2014four boats were lost in the first week of May alone, and three more by the end.\nFor the month of April Allied losses fell to 56 ships of 327,943 tons. In May 1943 the battle reached a climax with the battles of Convoy ONS 5, Convoy SC 129, Convoy SC 130. Throughout the battles only two ships were sunk in convoy in the Atlantic while an air anti-submarine escort was present. D\u00f6nitz depended on the surface manoeuvrability of his U-boats to locate targets, assemble wolfpacks and the complicated business of positioning his forces ahead of a convoy for an attack. Allied air power determined where and when U-boats could move freely on the surface. It was the combination of convoy escorts and air power that made the Atlantic unsuitable for pack operations. The US Navy introduced the K-class blimp. They forced a commander to dive to prevent the aircraft marking his position or attacking. From 10 to 24 May 1943, ten convoys passed through the mid-Atlantic. Six of the 370 ships were sunk; three were stragglers. Thirteen U-boats were sunk; four by warships, seven by aircraft, and two shared.\nBy 24 May, when D\u00f6nitz conceded defeat and withdrew the surviving crews from the field of battle, they had already lost 33 U-boats. At the end of May it had risen to 41. D\u00f6nitz tried to limit the damage to morale by declaring that the withdrawal was only temporary \"to avoid unnecessary losses in a period when our weapons are shown to be at a disadvantage\" and that \"the battle in the north Atlantic\u2014the decisive area\u2014will be resumed\". D\u00f6nitz did make a further attempt to regain the initiative, but the battle never reached the same pitch of intensity or hung in the balance, as during the spring of 1943. The Allied success won the Battle of the Atlantic. On 24 May D\u00f6nitz ordered the suspension of Atlantic operations, bringing an end to Black May.\nDefeat in the mid-Atlantic left D\u00f6nitz in a dilemma. The U-boats had proven unable to elude convoy escorts and attack convoys with success. He was concerned about crew morale suffering from idleness and a loss of experience with the latest Allied developments in anti-submarine warfare. Aside from problems of seaworthiness among machines and crew, there were not enough Submarine pens to store idle boats and they were a target for aircraft in port. D\u00f6nitz would not withdraw his submarines from combat operations, for he felt the ships, men and aircraft engaged in suppressing the U-boats could then be turned on Germany directly; the U-boat war was to continue.\nHunter-killer era.\nFrom mid-June 1943 the technological and industrial superiority of the Allied navies allowed the Americans, Canadians, and British to form hunter-killer groups consisting of fast anti-submarine escorts and aircraft carriers. The purpose of naval operations changed from avoiding U-boats and safeguarding convoys to seeking them out and destroying them wherever they operated. USN hunter-killer groups operated throughout the Atlantic. Argentia had been an important base for the naval taskforces until superseded by the Royal Canadian Navy in early 1943. U-boat operations were \"crushed\" by these task forces: 14 were sunk and only two of seven crews operating in Brazilian waters returned to Germany.\nD\u00f6nitz reacted by deploying his U-boats near the Azores where land-based aircraft still had difficulty reaching them. In this region he hoped to threaten the Gibraltar\u2013Britain convoy route. D\u00f6nitz intended to concentrate his power in a rough arc from West Africa to South America and the Caribbean. He hoped to maintain a presence in the western and central Atlantic, reduce losses and await new weapons and anti-detection devices. In this, he failed to \"stem the tide of U-boat losses.\" A large portion of the 39 U-boats deployed on these operations were intercepted. From May 1943, one historian wrote \"U-boats rash enough to close with an Atlantic convoy...were simply inviting destruction.\"\nD\u00f6nitz's crews faced danger from the outset. The transit routes through the Bay of Biscay were heavily patrolled by aircraft. From May to December 1943, 25 U-boats were sunk by Coastal Command, more were sunk by the USAAF and Royal Navy\u2014five and four respectively; with one shared by the navy and Coastal Command. To counter radar aircraft, D\u00f6nitz ordered his submarines to group together and merge their powerful anti-aircraft armament together while surfaced and recharging their batteries, after initially ordering the groups to remain surfaced throughout the journey and fight off aerial attackers with gunfire. The decision was to cost BdU heavy casualties. A group of U-boats were more likely to attract a radar contact, and Allied pilots soon learned to swarm their targets. D\u00f6nitz ordered his captains to traverse the Bay under the lee of the neutral Spanish coast, with a sharply rising coast which shielded U-boats from radar. After 4 August 1943, the number of destroyed U-boats fell from one every four days, to one every 27 until June 1944.\nUS hunter\u2013killer groups extended their patrols to the central Atlantic in the summer. They sank 15 U-boats from June through to August 1943. A number of supply submarines were destroyed crippling the Germans' ability to conduct long range operations. At the end of the summer, practically all supply U-boats had been destroyed. In September 1943, D\u00f6nitz ordered his submarines back to the North Atlantic. U-boats were equipped with the G7es torpedo, an acoustic torpedo, which the grand admiral hoped would wrest the technological initiative back. The torpedo was the centrepiece to D\u00f6nitz's plan. Great faith was also placed in the installation of radar to detect aircraft. It was intended as a successor to the Metox radar detector. A number of his boats were later retrofitted with the submarine snorkel, permitting the submarine to stay submerged. D\u00f6nitz placed much faith in the Type XXI submarine. He accepted that the older submarines were obsolete now that Allied defences in the air were complete. He required a \"true submarine\", equipped with a snorkel to allow his crews to stay submerged, at least to snorkel-depth, and evade radar-equipped aircraft. D\u00f6nitz was pleased with the promised top speed of 18 knots.\nThat month, 21 boats fought a battle with two formations; Convoys ONS 18/ON 202. The battle was a failure. In October an attack on Convoy SC 143 failed, even with limited air support from the \"Luftwaffe\". The battle with Convoys ONS 20/ON 206 in the same month was a comprehensive defeat. A fourth major battle, Convoy SL 138/MKS 28, developed in the last days of October and ended in another failure for D\u00f6nitz. The November battle around Convoy SL 139/MKS 30 ended in the repulse of 29 U-boats with the loss of only a single ship. Intelligence proved its worth. During the battles of convoys ONS 18/ON 202, D\u00f6nitz's admonitions to his commanders allowed the Allied intelligence services to uncover German tactical intentions. D\u00f6nitz had tried and failed to push his forces through lethal convoy defences. The hunter-killer groups were called in to hunt the remaining members of the wolfpacks, with predictable results. In mid-December 1943, D\u00f6nitz finally conceded not only the Atlantic, but the Gibraltar routes as well.\nThe hunter-killer and convoy escorts brought the wolfpack era to an end at the close of 1943. D\u00f6nitz resorted to sending out single submarines to the far reaches of the oceans in a bid to escape Allied naval power. In November 1943 he sent the last U-boat into the Gulf of Mexico just after the blackout restrictions were lifted. \"U-193\" achieved one final success. The end of 1943 ended the attempt of the U-boat arm to achieve a strategic victory in the Atlantic. That left only the Arctic convoys to the Soviet Union. On Christmas Eve, this became the sole preserve of the U-boats after the dispatch of \"Scharnhorst\" at the Battle of the North Cape.\nD\u00f6nitz's plan for 1944 was simply to survive and await the XXI and Type XXIII submarines. New radars were on the horizon and a direction finding antenna for \"Naxos\" was scheduled for use. D\u00f6nitz established a naval operations scientific staff to focus on more powerful centimetric radars. Production of submarines was streamlined. Parts for eight major sections were fabricated across 60 plants in Europe and assembled at Hamburg, Danzig and Bremen to ease the pressure of bombing and congestion at shipyards. The first of the new generation boats were expected by April 1944. D\u00f6nitz hoped for 33 per month by September. In early 1944, D\u00f6nitz opted to concentrate west of Ireland, at 15 and 17\u00b0 west, in the hope convoys would come to them. Single boats were still sent to the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean. With 66 vessels at sea at any one time, and with 200 boats operational, the BdU was still a viable threat and he believed the force could achieve modest success. The U-boats were painfully slow, strategically, operationally and tactically. Crossing the Atlantic took up to a month compared to a week in 1942. Positioning west of Ireland could take several weeks submerged. In the first quarter of 1944, U-boats sank only three of the 3,360 ships that passed south of Ireland. In return 29 crews were lost.A major concern to D\u00f6nitz was Operation Overlord, the long predicted landing in France, and what role the U-boat arm and surface forces could play in the defence. He was sensitive to a landing on the Bay of Biscay but retained boats there only for operational readiness. D\u00f6nitz ended reconnaissance operations in the region. In the BdU war diary he wrote of ending operations since \"otherwise the strong enemy air activity will lead to high losses which would only be acceptable if an immediate landing on the Biscay coast were expected. As this is no longer considered an acute danger the boats will remain at readiness in the concrete shelters.\"When the D-day landings took place on 6 June 1944, the U-boats were ordered into action with the awareness that the western flank of the invasion would be well protected at sea. Operational experience with the snorkel was too scant to devise instructions for its use. The narrow, shallow, waters of the English Channel provided few opportunities for charging the batteries. D\u00f6nitz feared the task was impossible. The group based at Brest, sent 15 submarines into action against the Cherbourg peninsula landings part of a 36-strong flotilla. Only eight had snorkels. The seven non-snorkel boats were ordered to attack on the surface. The BdU war diary entry on 6 June 1944 states that \"for those boats without schnorchel this means the last operation\". Of the 15, only five got near to the invasion fleet. Five of the snorkel boats survived. In exchange for 10 U-boats with the survivors damaged, two frigates, four freighters, and one tank landing ship were sunk. 22 U-boats were sunk from 6 to 30 June 1944. On 5 July 1944, the Allied Operation \"Dredger\" permitted hunter-killer groups to roam the Western Approaches and Biscay making it a \"no-go area\" for U-boats. U-boat operations against Normandy landings were a fiasco. D\u00f6nitz and the high command had been ignorant of the true scale of the naval D-day effort. D\u00f6nitz claimed his men sank five escorts, 12 merchant ships and four landing craft for 20 submarines and 1,000 men, of whom 238 were rescued. D\u00f6nitz's claims underplayed German losses, which were, in fact, 41 submarines from 82 in France, a 50 per cent loss rate.\nThe collapse of the German front in Normandy left only the bases in German-occupied Norway nearest to the Atlantic. The newer boats were not forthcoming either. Ninety Type XXI and 31 Type XIII boats were built by the end of 1944. Sixty of the former and 23 of the latter were in service but none were operational. D\u00f6nitz was left with the old VIIs to carry the war into 1945. A large number had snorkels, which enabled them to surface only upon reaching port. Submerged, this meant no radio or Enigma communications and far fewer sightings for the Allied intelligence network to exploit. D\u00f6nitz ordered his submarines to British coastal waters with some success in November and December 1944, achieving 85,639 tons. Admiral Andrew Cunningham remarked of the strategy, \"We are having a difficult time with the U-boats...the air are about 90 percent out of business and Asdic is failing us.\" The inshore waters impeded the use of Asdic, which became confused with wrecks, rocks, and tidal swirls. The new types could conceivably have capitalised on these developments but the war was nearly over. On 1 January 1945, D\u00f6nitz had 425 submarines; 144 operational. On 1 April 1945, it was 166 from 429. He threw into battle every available weapon as the German Reich collapsed. D\u00f6nitz supported the use of Human torpedoes; the Neger, Marder, Seehund and Biber were all used in suicide missions on his orders, perhaps inspired by the Japanese Kamikaze.\nOn 30 April 1945 Adolf Hitler committed suicide. D\u00f6nitz succeeded him as head of state. Admiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg succeeded D\u00f6nitz as commander-in-chief of the . On 4 May 1945 the German surrender at L\u00fcneburg Heath took place. D\u00f6nitz issued an order to all U-boats to cease combat operations and return to port or surrender to Allied naval vessels. The order was obeyed with a handful of notable exceptions\u2014the Actions of 5\u20136 May 1945, and Actions of 7\u20138 May 1945 occurred after the surrender. The surrendered U-boats numbered into the hundreds and were destroyed in the postwar Operation Deadlight. The U-boat war finally came to an end on 9 May 1945, the date of the German Instrument of Surrender.\nPresident of Germany.\nD\u00f6nitz admired Hitler and was vocal about the qualities he perceived in Hitler's leadership. In August 1943, he praised his foresightedness and confidence; \"anyone who thinks he can do better than the \"F\u00fchrer\" is stupid.\" D\u00f6nitz's relationship with Hitler strengthened through to the end of the war, particularly after the 20 July plot, for the naval staff officers were not involved; when news of it came there was indignation in the OKM. Even after the war, D\u00f6nitz said he could never have joined the conspirators. D\u00f6nitz tried to imbue Nazi ideas among his officers, though the indoctrination of the naval officer corps was not the brainchild of D\u00f6nitz, but rather a continuation of the Nazification of the navy begun under his predecessor Raeder. Naval officers were required to attend a five-day education course in Nazi ideology. D\u00f6nitz's loyalty to him and the cause was rewarded by Hitler, who, owing to D\u00f6nitz's leadership, never felt abandoned by the navy. In gratitude, Hitler appointed the navy's commander as his successor before he committed suicide.\nD\u00f6nitz's influence on military matters was also evident. Hitler acted on D\u00f6nitz's advice in September 1944 to block the Gulf of Finland after Finland abandoned the Axis powers. Operation Tanne Ost was a poorly executed disaster. D\u00f6nitz shared Hitler's senseless strategic judgement\u2014with the Courland Pocket on the verge of collapse, and the air and army forces requesting a withdrawal, the two men were preoccupied in planning an attack on an isolated island in the far north. Hitler's willingness to listen to the naval commander was based on his high opinion of the navy's usefulness at this time. It reinforced isolated coastal garrisons along the Baltic and evacuated thousands of German soldiers and civilians in order that they might continue to participate in the war effort into the spring of 1945.\nThrough 1944 and 1945, the D\u00f6nitz-initiated Operation Hannibal had the distinction of being the largest naval evacuation in history. The Baltic Fleet was presented with a mass of targets, the subsequent Soviet Baltic Sea submarine campaign in 1944 and Soviet Baltic Sea campaign in 1945 inflicted grievous losses during \"Hannibal\". The most notable was the sinking of the \"MV Wilhelm Gustloff\" by a Soviet submarine. The liner had nearly 10,000 people on board. The evacuations continued after the surrender. From 3 to 9 May 1945, 81,000 of the 150,000 persons waiting on the Hel Peninsula were evacuated without loss. Albrecht Brandi, commander of the eastern Baltic, initiated a counter operation, the Gulf of Finland campaign, but failed to have an impact.\nIn the final days of the war, after Hitler had taken refuge in the beneath the Reich Chancellery garden in Berlin, Hermann G\u00f6ring was considered the obvious successor to Hitler, followed by Heinrich Himmler. G\u00f6ring, however, infuriated Hitler by radioing him in Berlin to ask for permission to assume leadership of the Reich. Himmler also tried to seize power by entering into negotiations with Count Bernadotte. On 28 April 1945, the BBC reported Himmler had offered surrender to the western Allies and that the offer had been declined.\nFrom mid-April 1945, D\u00f6nitz and elements of what remained of the Reich government moved into the buildings of the \"Stadtheide Barracks\" in Pl\u00f6n. In his last will and testament, dated 29 April 1945, Hitler named D\u00f6nitz his successor as (Head of state), with the titles of \"Reichspr\u00e4sident\" (President) and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. The same document named Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels as Head of government with the title of (Chancellor). Hitler would not name any successors to hold his titles of F\u00fchrer or leader of the Nazi Party. Furthermore, Hitler declared both G\u00f6ring and Himmler traitors and expelled them from the party. He committed suicide on 30 April.\nOn 1 May, the day after Hitler's own suicide, Goebbels committed suicide. D\u00f6nitz thus became the sole representative of the collapsing German Reich. On 2 May, the new government of the Reich fled to Flensburg-M\u00fcrwik. That night, 2 May, D\u00f6nitz made a nationwide radio address in which he announced Hitler's death and said the war would continue in the East \"to save Germany from destruction by the advancing Bolshevik enemy.\" D\u00f6nitz remained in Flensburg\u2013M\u00fcrwik until his arrest on 23 May 1945.\nD\u00f6nitz knew that Germany's position was untenable and the \"Wehrmacht\" was no longer capable of offering meaningful resistance. During his brief period in office, he devoted most of his effort to ensuring the loyalty of the German armed forces and trying to ensure German personnel would surrender to the British or Americans and not the Soviets. He feared vengeful Soviet reprisals, and hoped to strike a deal with the Western Allies. In the end, D\u00f6nitz's tactics were moderately successful, enabling about 1.8\u00a0million German soldiers to escape Soviet capture. As many as 2.2\u00a0million may have been evacuated.\nFlensburg Government.\nOn 4 May, Admiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg, representing D\u00f6nitz, surrendered all German forces in the Netherlands, Denmark, and northwestern Germany to Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery at L\u00fcneburg Heath southeast of Hamburg. A day later, D\u00f6nitz sent Friedeburg to US General Dwight D. Eisenhower's headquarters in Reims, France, to negotiate a complete surrender to the Allies.\nThe Chief of Staff of OKW, (Colonel-General) Alfred Jodl, arrived a day later. D\u00f6nitz had instructed them to draw out the negotiations for as long as possible so that German troops and refugees could surrender to the Western powers, but when Eisenhower let it be known he would not tolerate their stalling, D\u00f6nitz authorised Jodl to sign the instrument of unconditional surrender at 1:30 on the morning of 7 May. Just over an hour later, Jodl signed the documents. The surrender documents included the phrase, \"All forces under German control to cease active operations at 23:01 hours Central European Time on 8 May 1945.\" At Stalin's insistence, on 8 May, shortly before midnight, () Wilhelm Keitel repeated the signing in Berlin at Marshal Georgy Zhukov's headquarters, with General Carl Spaatz of the USAAF present as Eisenhower's representative. At the time specified, World War II in Europe ended.\nOn 23 May, the Flensburg Government (also known as the \"D\u00f6nitz government\") was dissolved when D\u00f6nitz was arrested by an RAF Regiment task force. Jodl, Speer and other members were also handed over to troops of the Herefordshire Regiment at Flensburg.\nDonitz's \"Gro\u00dfadmiral's\" ceremonial baton, awarded to him by Hitler, can be seen in the regimental museum of the King's Shropshire Light Infantry in Shrewsbury Castle. His \"Kriegsmarine\" flag, which was removed from his headquarters, can be seen at the RAF Regiment Heritage Centre at RAF Honington and his car pennant in the regimental museum of the Herefordshire Light Infantry.\nNazism and antisemitism.\nD\u00f6nitz was a dedicated Nazi and a passionate supporter of Hitler, something he attempted to obscure after the war. Raeder described him as \"a picture-book Nazi and confirmed anti-Semite\". Several naval officers described him as \"closely tied to Hitler and Nazi ideology.\" On occasion, he spoke of Hitler's humanity. His fervent pro-Hitler attitude led to him being known ironically as \"Hitler Youth Quex\", after the fictionalised hero of a Nazi novel and feature film. He refused to help Albert Speer stop the scorched earth policy dictated by Hitler and is also noted to have declared, \"In comparison to Hitler we are all pipsqueaks. Anyone who believes he can do better than the F\u00fchrer is stupid.\"\nD\u00f6nitz contributed to the spread of Nazism within the . He insisted that officers share his political views and, as head of the , formally joined the Nazi Party on 1 February 1944, as member 9,664,999. He was awarded the Golden Party Badge for his loyalty to the party later that year. D\u00f6nitz's influence over naval officers contributed to none joining the attempts to kill Hitler.\nFrom an ideological standpoint, D\u00f6nitz was anti-Marxist and antisemitic and believed that Germany needed to fight the \"poison of Jewry\". Several antisemitic statements by D\u00f6nitz are known. When Sweden closed its international waters to Germany, D\u00f6nitz blamed this action on their fear and dependence on \"international Jewish capital.\" In August 1944 he declared, \"I would rather eat dirt than see my grandchildren grow up in the filthy, poisonous atmosphere of Jewry.\"\nHis fellow officers noted he was under Hitler's influence, and closely wedded to Nazi ideology. On German Heroes' Day (12 March) of 1944, D\u00f6nitz declared that, without Adolf Hitler, Germany would be beset by \"the poison of Jewry,\" and the country destroyed for lack of the \"uncompromising ideology\" of Nazism:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What would have become of our country today, if the F\u00fchrer had not united us under National Socialism? Divided along party lines, beset with the spreading poison of Jewry and vulnerable to it, because we lacked the defense of our present uncompromising ideology, we would have long since succumbed under the burden of this war and delivered ourselves to the enemy who would have mercilessly destroyed us.\nAt the Nuremberg trials, D\u00f6nitz claimed the statement about the \"poison of Jewry\" was regarding \"the endurance, the power to endure, of the people, as it was composed, could be better preserved than if there were Jewish elements in the nation.\" Later, during the Nuremberg trials, D\u00f6nitz claimed to know nothing about the extermination of Jews and declared that \"nobody among my men thought about violence against Jews.\" D\u00f6nitz told Leon Goldensohn, an American psychiatrist at Nuremberg, \"I never had any idea of the goings-on as far as Jews were concerned. Hitler said each man should take care of his business and mine was U-boats and the Navy.\" Following the war, D\u00f6nitz tried to hide his knowledge of the Holocaust. He was present at the October 1943 Posen Conference where Himmler described the mass murder of Jews with the intent of making the audience complicit in this crime. It cannot be proven beyond doubt that he was present during Himmler's segment of the conference, which openly discussed the mass murder of European Jews.\nEven after the Nuremberg Trials, with the crimes of the Nazi state well-known, D\u00f6nitz remained an antisemite. In April 1953, he told Speer that if it was the choice of the Americans and not the Jews, he would have been released.\nNuremberg war crimes trials.\nFollowing the war, D\u00f6nitz was held as a prisoner of war by the Allies. He was indicted as a major war criminal at the Nuremberg trials on three counts. One: conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Two: planning, initiating, and waging wars of aggression. Three: crimes against the laws of war. D\u00f6nitz was found not guilty on count one of the indictment, but guilty on counts two and three.\nDuring the trial, the army psychologist Gustave Gilbert was allowed to examine Nazi leaders on trial for war crimes. Among other tests, a German version of the Wechsler\u2013Bellevue IQ test was administered. D\u00f6nitz and Hermann G\u00f6ring scored 138, which made them equally the third-highest among the Nazi leaders tested. D\u00f6nitz was also examined by Chief Medical Officer Lt. Col. Rene Juchli who reported that D\u00f6nitz suffered from \"a chronic prostate disorder\".\nAt the trial, D\u00f6nitz was charged with waging unrestricted submarine warfare against neutral shipping, permitting Hitler's Commando Order of 18 October 1942 to remain in full force when he became commander-in-chief of the Navy, and to that extent responsibility for that crime. His defence was that the order excluded men captured in naval warfare, and that the order had not been acted upon by any men under his command. Added to that was his knowledge of 12,000 involuntary foreign workers working in the shipyards, and doing nothing to stop it. D\u00f6nitz was unable to defend himself on this charge convincingly when cross-examined by prosecutor Sir David Maxwell Fyfe.\nOn 25 February 1945, Hitler asked D\u00f6nitz whether the Geneva Convention should be denounced. Hitler's motives were twofold. The first was that reprisals could be taken against Western Allied prisoners of war; second, it would deter German forces from surrendering to the Western Allies, as was happening on the Eastern Front where the convention was in abeyance. Instead of arguing the conventions should never be denounced, D\u00f6nitz suggested it was not expedient to do so, so the court found against him on this issue; but as the convention was not denounced by Germany, and British prisoners in camps under D\u00f6nitz's jurisdiction were treated strictly according to the Convention, the Court considered these mitigating circumstances.\nAmong the war-crimes charges, D\u00f6nitz was accused of waging unrestricted submarine warfare for issuing War Order No. 154 in 1939, and another similar order after the \"Laconia\" incident in 1942, not to rescue survivors from ships attacked by submarine. By issuing these two orders, he was found guilty of causing Germany to be in breach of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936. However, as evidence of similar conduct by the Allies was presented at his trial, his sentence was not assessed on the grounds of this breach of international law.\nOn the specific war crimes charge of ordering unrestricted submarine warfare, D\u00f6nitz was found \"[not] guilty for his conduct of submarine warfare against British armed merchant ships\", because they were often armed and equipped with radios which they used to notify the admiralty of attack. As stated by the judges:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;D\u00f6nitz is charged with waging unrestricted submarine warfare contrary to the Naval Protocol of 1936 to which Germany acceded, and which reaffirmed the rules of submarine warfare laid down in the London Naval Agreement of 1930\u00a0... The order of D\u00f6nitz to sink neutral ships without warning when found within these zones was, therefore, in the opinion of the Tribunal, violation of the Protocol\u00a0... The orders, then, prove D\u00f6nitz is guilty of a violation of the Protocol\u00a0... The sentence of D\u00f6nitz is not assessed on the ground of his breaches of the international law of submarine warfare.\nHis sentence on unrestricted submarine warfare was not assessed because of similar actions by the Allies. In particular, the British Admiralty, on 8 May 1940, had ordered all vessels in the Skagerrak sunk on sight, and Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, wartime commander-in-chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, stated the US Navy had waged unrestricted submarine warfare against Japan in the Pacific from the day the US officially entered the war. Thus, D\u00f6nitz was not charged of waging unrestricted submarine warfare against unarmed neutral shipping by ordering all ships in designated areas in international waters to be sunk without warning.\nD\u00f6nitz was imprisoned for 10 years in Spandau Prison in what was then West Berlin. During his period in prison he was unrepentant, and maintained that he had done nothing wrong. He also rejected Speer's attempts to persuade him to end his devotion to Hitler and accept responsibility for the wrongs the German Government had committed. Conversely, over 100 senior Allied officers sent letters to D\u00f6nitz conveying their disappointment over the unfairness and verdict of his trial.\nLater years and death.\nD\u00f6nitz was released on 1 October 1956 and retired to the small village of Aum\u00fchle in Schleswig-Holstein in northern West Germany. There, he worked on two books. His memoirs, \"Zehn Jahre, Zwanzig Tage\" (\"Memoirs: Ten Years and Twenty Days\"), were released in Germany in 1958 and became available in an English translation the following year. This book recounted D\u00f6nitz's experiences as U-boat commander (10 years) and President of Germany (20 days). In it, D\u00f6nitz explains the Nazi regime as a product of its time, but argues he was not a politician and thus not morally responsible for many of the regime's crimes. He likewise criticises dictatorship as a fundamentally flawed form of government and blames it for many of the Nazi era's failings. The historian Alan P. Rems has written that D\u00f6nitz's memoirs are unconvincing and that, \"unimpeded by a meaningful Nuremberg verdict, D\u00f6nitz fashioned a legend that could be embraced by the most unregenerate Nazis as well as credulous Allied officers who accepted his sanitized version of history and showered D\u00f6nitz with letters of support as a wronged brother-in-arms\".\nD\u00f6nitz's second book, (\"My Ever-Changing Life\") is less known, perhaps because it deals with the events of his life before 1934. This book was first published in 1968, and a new edition was released in 1998 with the revised title (\"My Martial Life\"). In 1973, he appeared in the Thames Television production \"The World at War\", in one of his few television appearances.\nD\u00f6nitz was unrepentant regarding his role in World War II, saying that he had acted at all times out of duty to his nation. In 1976, D\u00f6nitz appeared in \"The Memory of Justice\". In the documentary, D\u00f6nitz discusses the Nuremberg trials and his experience of 1946 along with Albert Speer. He lived out the rest of his life in relative obscurity in Aum\u00fchle, occasionally corresponding with collectors of German naval history. Around 1974, D\u00f6nitz was contacted by the neo-Nazi conspiracy theorist and early \"Reichsb\u00fcrger\" Manfred Roeder, who tried to prove that the German Reich still existed. Roeder assumed that D\u00f6nitz remained the legal head of state, but the former admiral considered the idea ridiculous and firmly stated that he no longer considered himself President of Germany. Regarding this as a resignation declaration, Roeder subsequently declared himself the new leader of Germany and eventually became active as a terrorist.\nD\u00f6nitz died in Aum\u00fchle of a heart attack on Christmas Eve in 1980 at the age of 89. As the last German officer with the rank of \"\" (grand admiral), he was honoured by many former servicemen and foreign naval officers who came to pay their respects at his funeral on 6 January 1981. He was buried in Waldfriedhof Cemetery in Aum\u00fchle without military honours, and service members were not allowed to wear uniforms to the funeral. Also in attendance were over 100 holders of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAttribution:"}
{"id": "16775", "revid": "36336112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16775", "title": "Kyoto Protocol", "text": "1997 international treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\nThe was an international treaty which extended the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that commits state parties to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, based on the scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and that human-made CO2 emissions are driving it. The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on 11 December 1997 and entered into force on 16 February 2005. There were 192 parties (Canada withdrew from the protocol, effective December 2012) to the Protocol in 2020.\nThe Kyoto Protocol implemented the objective of the UNFCCC to reduce the onset of global warming by reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to \"a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\" (Article 2). The Kyoto Protocol applied to the seven greenhouse gases listed in Annex A: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). Nitrogen trifluoride was added for the second compliance period during the Doha Round.\nThe Protocol was based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities: it acknowledged that individual countries have different capabilities in combating climate change, owing to economic development, and therefore placed the obligation to reduce current emissions on developed countries on the basis that they are historically responsible for the current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nThe Protocol's first commitment period started in 2008 and ended in 2012. All 36 countries that fully participated in the first commitment period complied with the Protocol. However, nine countries had to resort to the flexibility mechanisms by funding emission reductions in other countries because their national emissions were slightly greater than their targets. The 2008 financial crisis reduced emissions. The greatest emission reductions were seen in the former Eastern Bloc countries because the dissolution of the Soviet Union reduced their emissions in the early 1990s. Even though the 36 developed countries reduced their emissions, the global emissions increased by 32% from 1990 to 2010.\nA second commitment period was agreed to in 2012 to extend the agreement to 2020, known as the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, in which 37 countries had binding targets: Australia, the European Union (and its then 28 member states, now 27), Belarus, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, and Ukraine. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine stated that they may withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol or not put into legal force the Amendment with second round targets. Japan, New Zealand, and Russia had participated in Kyoto's first-round but did not take on new targets in the second commitment period. Other developed countries without second-round targets were Canada (which withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in 2012) and the United States (which did not ratify). If they were to remain as a part of the protocol, Canadian politicians claimed Canada would be hit with a $14 billion fine, which would be devastating to their economy, hence the reluctant decision to exit. As of October 2020, 147 states had accepted the Doha Amendment. It entered into force on 31 December 2020, following its acceptance by the mandated minimum of at least 144 states, although the second commitment period ended on the same day. Of the 37 parties with binding commitments, 34 had ratified.\nNegotiations were held in the framework of the yearly UNFCCC Climate Change Conferences on measures to be taken after the second commitment period ended in 2020. This resulted in the 2015 adoption of the Paris Agreement, which is a separate instrument under the UNFCCC rather than an amendment of the Kyoto Protocol.\nChronology.\n1992 \u2013 The UN Conference on the Environment and Development is held in Rio de Janeiro. It results in the Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) among other agreements.\n1995 \u2013 Parties to the UNFCCC meet in Berlin (the 1st Conference of Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC) to outline specific targets on emissions.\n1997 \u2013 In December the parties conclude the Kyoto Protocol in Kyoto, Japan, in which they agree to the broad outlines of emissions targets.\n2004 \u2013 Russia and Canada ratify the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC bringing the treaty into effect on 16 February 2005.\n2011 \u2013 Canada became the first signatory to announce its withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol.\n2012 \u2013 On 31 December 2012, the first commitment period under the Protocol expired.\nThe official meeting of all states party to the Kyoto Protocol is the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The first conference was held in 1995 in Berlin (COP 1). The first Meeting of Parties of the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) was held in 2005 in conjunction with COP 11.\nObjectives.\nThe main goal of the Kyoto Protocol was to control emissions of the main anthropogenic (human-emitted) greenhouse gases (GHGs) in ways that reflect underlying national differences in GHG emissions, wealth, and capacity to make the reductions. The treaty follows the main principles agreed in the original 1992 UN Framework Convention. According to the treaty, in 2012, Annex I Parties who have ratified the treaty must have fulfilled their obligations of greenhouse gas emissions limitations established for the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period (2008\u20132012). These emissions limitation commitments are listed in Annex B of the Protocol.\nThe Kyoto Protocol's first round commitments are the first detailed step taken within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Protocol establishes a structure of rolling emission reduction commitment periods. It set a timetable starting in 2006 for negotiations to establish emission reduction commitments for a second commitment period. The first period emission reduction commitments expired on 31 December 2012.\nThe first-round Kyoto emissions limitation commitments were not sufficient to stabilize the atmospheric concentration of GHGs. Stabilization of atmospheric GHG concentrations will require further emissions reductions after the end of the first-round Kyoto commitment period in 2012.\nThe ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is the \"stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would stop dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\" Even if Annex I Parties succeed in meeting their first-round commitments, much greater emission reductions will be required in future to stabilize atmospheric GHG concentrations.\nFor each of the different anthropogenic GHGs, different levels of emissions reductions would be required to meet the objective of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important anthropogenic GHG. Stabilizing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere would ultimately require the effective elimination of anthropogenic CO2 emissions.\nTo achieve stabilization, global GHG emissions must peak, then decline. The lower the desired stabilization level, the sooner this peak and decline must occur. For a given stabilization level, larger emissions reductions in the near term allow for less stringent emissions reductions later. On the other hand, less stringent near term emissions reductions would, for a given stabilization level, require more stringent emissions reductions later on.\nThe first period Kyoto emissions limitations can be viewed as a first-step towards achieving atmospheric stabilization of GHGs. In this sense, the first period Kyoto commitments may affect what future atmospheric stabilization level can be achieved.\nPrincipal concepts.\nSome of the principal concepts of the Kyoto Protocol are:\nFlexibility mechanisms.\nThe Protocol defines three \"Flexibility Mechanisms\" that can be used by Annex I Parties in meeting their emission limitation commitments. The flexibility mechanisms are International Emissions Trading (IET), the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and Joint Implementation (JI). IET allows Annex I Parties to \"trade\" their emissions (Assigned Amount Units, AAUs, or \"allowances\" for short).\nThe economic basis for providing this flexibility is that the marginal cost of reducing (or abating) emissions differs among countries. \"Marginal cost\" is the cost of abating the last tonne of CO2-eq for an Annex I/non-Annex I Party. At the time of the original Kyoto targets, studies suggested that the flexibility mechanisms could reduce the overall (aggregate) cost of meeting the targets. Studies also showed that national losses in Annex I gross domestic product (GDP) could be reduced by the use of the flexibility mechanisms.\nThe CDM and JI are called \"project-based mechanisms\", in that they generate emission reductions from projects. The difference between IET and the project-based mechanisms is that IET is based on the setting of a quantitative restriction of emissions, while the CDM and JI are based on the idea of \"production\" of emission reductions. The CDM is designed to encourage production of emission reductions in non-Annex I Parties, while JI encourages production of emission reductions in Annex I Parties.\nThe production of emission reductions generated by the CDM and JI can be used by Annex I Parties in meeting their emission limitation commitments. The emission reductions produced by the CDM and JI are both measured against a hypothetical baseline of emissions that would have occurred in the absence of a particular emission reduction project. The emission reductions produced by the CDM are called Certified emission reductions (CERs); reductions produced by JI are called emission reduction units (ERUs). The reductions are called \"credits\" because they are emission reductions credited against a hypothetical baseline of emissions.\nOnly emission reduction projects that do not involve using nuclear energy are eligible for accreditation under the CDM, in order to prevent nuclear technology exports from becoming the default route for obtaining credits under the CDM.\nEach Annex I country is required to submit an annual report of inventories of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from sources and removals from sinks under UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. These countries nominate a person (called a \"designated national authority\") to create and manage its greenhouse gas inventory. Virtually all of the non-Annex I countries have also established a designated national authority to manage their Kyoto obligations, specifically the \"CDM process\". This determines which GHG projects they wish to propose for accreditation by the CDM Executive Board.\nInternational emissions trading.\nIntergovernmental emissions trading.\nThe design of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) implicitly allows for trade of national Kyoto obligations to occur between participating countries. The Carbon Trust found that other than the trading that occurs as part of the EU ETS, no intergovernmental emissions trading had taken place.\nOne of the environmental problems with IET is the large surplus of allowances that are available. Russia, Ukraine, and the new EU-12 member states (the Kyoto Parties Annex I Economies-in-Transition, abbreviated \"EIT\": Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine) have a surplus of allowances, while many OECD countries have a deficit. Some of the EITs with a surplus regard it as potential compensation for the trauma of their economic restructuring. When the Kyoto treaty was negotiated, it was recognized that emissions targets for the EITs might lead to them having an excess number of allowances. This excess of allowances were viewed by the EITs as \"headroom\" to grow their economies. The surplus has, however, also been referred to by some as \"hot air\", a term which Russia (a country with an estimated surplus of 3.1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent allowances) views as \"quite offensive\".\nOECD countries with a deficit could meet their Kyoto commitments by buying allowances from transition countries with a surplus. Unless other commitments were made to reduce the total surplus in allowances, such trade would not actually result in emissions being reduced (see also the section below on the Green Investment Scheme).\n\"Green Investment Schemes\".\nThe \"Green Investment Scheme\" (GIS) is a plan for achieving environmental benefits from trading surplus allowances (AAUs) under the Kyoto Protocol. The Green Investment Scheme (GIS), a mechanism in the framework of International Emissions Trading (IET), is designed to achieve greater flexibility in reaching the targets of the Kyoto Protocol while preserving environmental integrity of IET. However, using the GIS is not required under the Kyoto Protocol, and there is no official definition of the term.\nUnder the GIS a party to the protocol expecting that the development of its economy will not exhaust its Kyoto quota, can sell the excess of its Kyoto quota units (AAUs) to another party. The proceeds from the AAU sales should be \"greened\", i.e. channelled to the development and implementation of the projects either acquiring the greenhouse gases emission reductions (hard greening) or building up the necessary framework for this process (soft greening).\nTrade in AAUs.\nLatvia was one of the front-runners of GISs. World Bank (2011) reported that Latvia has stopped offering AAU sales because of low AAU prices. In 2010, Estonia was the preferred source for AAU buyers, followed by the Czech Republic and Poland.\nJapan's national policy to meet their Kyoto target includes the purchase of AAUs sold under GISs. In 2010, Japan and Japanese firms were the main buyers of AAUs. In terms of the international carbon market, trade in AAUs are a small proportion of overall market value. In 2010, 97% of trade in the international carbon market was driven by the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS).\nClean Development Mechanism.\nBetween 2001, which was the first year Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects could be registered, and 2012, the end of the first Kyoto commitment period, the CDM is expected to produce some 1.5\u00a0billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in emission reductions. Most of these reductions are through renewable energy commercialisation, energy efficiency, and fuel switching (World Bank, 2010, p.\u00a0262). By 2012, the largest potential for production of CERs are estimated in China (52% of total CERs) and India (16%). CERs produced in Latin America and the Caribbean make up 15% of the potential total, with Brazil as the largest producer in the region (7%).\nJoint Implementation.\nThe formal crediting period for Joint Implementation (JI) was aligned with the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, and did not start until January 2008 (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.\u00a020). In November 2008, only 22 JI projects had been officially approved and registered. The total projected emission savings from JI by 2012 are about one tenth that of the CDM. Russia accounts for about two-thirds of these savings, with the remainder divided up roughly equally between Ukraine and the EU's New Member States. Emission savings include cuts in methane, HFC, and N2O emissions.\nDetails of the agreement.\nThe agreement is a protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which did not set any legally binding limitations on emissions or enforcement mechanisms. Only Parties to the UNFCCC can become Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol was adopted at the third session of the Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan.\nNational emission targets specified in the Kyoto Protocol exclude international aviation and shipping. Kyoto Parties can use land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) in meeting their targets. LULUCF activities are also called \"sink\" activities. Changes in sinks and land use can have an effect on the climate, and indeed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Special Report on Land use, land-use change, and forestry estimates that since 1750 a third of global warming has been caused by land use change. Particular criteria apply to the definition of forestry under the Kyoto Protocol.\nForest management, cropland management, grazing land management, and revegetation are all eligible LULUCF activities under the Protocol. Annex I Parties use of forest management in meeting their targets is capped.\nFirst commitment period: 2008\u20132012.\nUnder the Kyoto Protocol, 37 industrialized countries and the European Community (the European Union-15, made up of 15 states at the time of the Kyoto negotiations) commit themselves to binding targets for GHG emissions. The targets apply to the four greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (), nitrous oxide (), sulphur hexafluoride (), and two groups of gases, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). The six GHG are translated into CO2 equivalents in determining reductions in emissions. These reduction targets are in addition to the industrial gases, chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which are dealt with under the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.\nUnder the Protocol, only the Annex I Parties have committed themselves to national or joint reduction targets (formally called \"quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives\" (QELRO) \u2013 Article 4.1). Parties to the Kyoto Protocol not listed in Annex I of the convention (the non-Annex I Parties) are mostly low-income developing countries, and may participate in the Kyoto Protocol through the Clean Development Mechanism (explained below).\nThe emissions limitations of Annex I Parties varies between different Parties. Some Parties have emissions limitations reduce below the base year level, some have limitations at the base year level (no permitted increase above the base year level), while others have limitations above the base year level.\nEmission limits do not include emissions by international aviation and shipping. Although Belarus and Turkey are listed in the convention's Annex I, they do not have emissions targets as they were not Annex I Parties when the Protocol was adopted. Kazakhstan does not have a target, but has declared that it wishes to become an Annex I Party to the convention.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Annex I countries under the Kyoto Protocol, their 2008\u20132012 commitments as % of base year, and 1990 emission levels (% of all Annex I countries)\nFor most state parties, 1990 is the base year for the national GHG inventory and the calculation of the assigned amount. However, five state parties have an alternative base year:\nAnnex I Parties can use a range of sophisticated \"flexibility\" mechanisms (see below) to meet their targets. Annex I Parties can achieve their targets by allocating reduced annual allowances to major operators within their borders, or by allowing these operators to exceed their allocations by offsetting any excess through a mechanism that is agreed by all the parties to the UNFCCC, such as by buying emission allowances from other operators which have excess emissions credits.\nNegotiations.\nArticle 4.2 of the UNFCCC commits industrialized countries to \"[take] the lead\" in reducing emissions. The initial aim was for industrialized countries to stabilize their emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. The failure of key industrialized countries to move in this direction was a principal reason why Kyoto moved to binding commitments.\nAt the first UNFCCC Conference of the Parties in Berlin, the G77 was able to push for a mandate (the \"Berlin mandate\") where it was recognized that:\nDuring negotiations, the G-77 represented 133 developing countries. China was not a member of the group but an associate. It has since become a member.\nThe Berlin mandate was recognized in the Kyoto Protocol in that developing countries were not subject to emission reduction commitments in the first Kyoto commitment period. However, the large potential for growth in developing country emissions made negotiations on this issue tense. In the final agreement, the Clean Development Mechanism was designed to limit emissions in developing countries, but in such a way that developing countries do not bear the costs for limiting emissions. The general assumption was that developing countries would face quantitative commitments in later commitment periods, and at the same time, developed countries would meet their first round commitments.\nEmissions cuts.\nThere were multiple emissions cuts proposed by UNFCCC parties during negotiations. The G77 and China were in favour of strong uniform emission cuts across the developed world. The US originally proposed for the second round of negotiations on Kyoto commitments to follow the negotiations of the first. In the end, negotiations on the second period were set to open no later than 2005. Countries over-achieving in their first period commitments can \"bank\" their unused allowances for use in the subsequent period.\nThe EU initially argued for only three GHGs to be included \u2013 CO2, , and \u2013 with other gases such as HFCs regulated separately. The EU also wanted to have a \"bubble\" commitment, whereby it could make a collective commitment that allowed some EU members to increase their emissions, while others cut theirs.\nThe most vulnerable nations \u2013 the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) \u2013 pushed for deep uniform cuts by developed nations, with the goal of having emissions reduced to the greatest possible extent. Countries that had supported differentiation of targets had different ideas as to how it should be calculated, and many different indicators were proposed. Two examples include differentiation of targets based on gross domestic product (GDP), and differentiation based on energy intensity (energy use per unit of economic output).\nThe final targets negotiated in the Protocol are the result of last minute political compromises. The targets closely match those decided by Argentinian Raul Estrada, the diplomat who chaired the negotiations. The numbers given to each Party by Chairman Estrada were based on targets already pledged by Parties, information received on latest negotiating positions, and the goal of achieving the strongest possible environmental outcome. The final targets are weaker than those proposed by some Parties, e.g., the Alliance of Small Island States and the G-77 and China, but stronger than the targets proposed by others, e.g., Canada and the United States.\nRelation to temperature targets.\nAt the 16th Conference of the Parties held in 2010, Parties to the UNFCCC agreed that future global warming should be limited below 2\u00b0C relative to the pre-industrial temperature level. One of the stabilization levels discussed in relation to this temperature target is to hold atmospheric concentrations of GHGs at 450 parts per million (ppm) CO2- eq. Stabilization at 450\u00a0ppm could be associated with a 26 to 78% risk of exceeding the 2\u00a0\u00b0C target.\nScenarios assessed by Gupta \"et al.\" (2007) suggest that Annex I emissions would need to be 25% to 40% below 1990 levels by 2020, and 80% to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050. The only Annex I Parties to have made voluntary pledges in line with this are Japan (25% below 1990 levels by 2020) and Norway (30\u201340% below 1990 levels by 2020).\nGupta \"et al.\" (2007) also looked at what 450\u00a0ppm scenarios projected for non-Annex I Parties. Projections indicated that by 2020, non-Annex I emissions in several regions (Latin America, the Middle East, East Asia, and centrally planned Asia) would need to be substantially reduced below \"business-as-usual\". \"Business-as-usual\" are projected non-Annex I emissions in the absence of any new policies to control emissions. Projections indicated that by 2050, emissions in all non-Annex I regions would need to be substantially reduced below \"business-as-usual\".\nFinancial commitments.\nThe Protocol also reaffirms the principle that developed countries have to pay billions of dollars, and supply technology to other countries for climate-related studies and projects. The principle was originally agreed in UNFCCC. One such project is The Adaptation Fund, which has been established by the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are Parties to the Kyoto Protocol.\nImplementation provisions.\nThe protocol left several issues open to be decided later by the sixth Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC, which attempted to resolve these issues at its meeting in the Hague in late 2000, but it was unable to reach an agreement due to disputes between the European Union (who favoured a tougher implementation) and the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia (who wanted the agreement to be less demanding and more flexible).\nIn 2001, a continuation of the previous meeting (COP6-bis) was held in Bonn, where the required decisions were adopted. After some concessions, the supporters of the protocol (led by the European Union) managed to secure the agreement of Japan and Russia by allowing more use of carbon dioxide sinks.\n was held from 29 October 2001 through 9 November 2001 in Marrakesh to establish the final details of the protocol.\nThe first Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (MOP1) was held in Montreal from 28 November to 9 December 2005, along with the 11th conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP11). See United Nations Climate Change Conference.\nDuring COP13 in Bali, 36 developed Contact Group countries (plus the EU as a party in the European Union) agreed to a 10% emissions increase for Iceland; but, since the EU's member states each have individual obligations, much larger increases (up to 27%) are allowed for some of the less developed EU countries (see below ). Reduction limitations expired in 2013.\nMechanism of compliance.\nThe protocol defines a mechanism of \"compliance\" as a \"monitoring compliance with the commitments and penalties for non-compliance.\" According to Grubb (2003), the explicit consequences of non-compliance of the treaty are weak compared to domestic law. Yet, the compliance section of the treaty was highly contested in the Marrakesh Accords.\nMonitoring emissions.\nMonitoring emissions in international agreements is tough as in international law, there is no police power, creating the incentive for states to find 'ways around' monitoring. The Kyoto Protocol regulated six sinks and sources of Gases. Carbon dioxide, Methane, Nirous oxide, Hydroflurocarbons, Sulfur hexafluouride and Perfluorocarbons. Monitoring these gases can become quite a challenge. Methane can be monitored and measured from irrigated rice fields and can be measured by the seedling growing up to harvest. Future implications state that this can be affected by more cost effective ways to control emissions as changes in types of fertilizer can reduce emissions by 50%. In addition to this, many countries are unable to monitor certain ways of carbon absorption through trees and soils to an accurate level.\nEnforcing emission cuts.\nIf the enforcement branch determines that an Annex I country is not in compliance with its emissions limitation, then that country is required to make up the difference during the second commitment period plus an additional 30%. In addition, that country will be suspended from making transfers under an emissions trading program.\nRatification process.\nCountries that ratified the Protocol.\nThe Protocol was adopted by COP 3 of UNFCCC on 11 December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan. It was opened on 16 March 1998 for signature during one year by parties to UNFCCC, when it was signed Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, the Maldives, Samoa, St. Lucia and Switzerland. At the end of the signature period, 82 countries and the European Community had signed. Ratification (which is required to become a party to the Protocol) started on 17 September with ratification by Fiji. Countries that did not sign acceded to the convention, which has the same legal effect.\nArticle 25 of the Protocol specifies that the Protocol enters into force \"on the ninetieth day after the date on which not less than 55 Parties to the Convention, incorporating Parties included in Annex I which accounted in total for at least 55% of the total carbon dioxide emissions for 1990 of the Annex I countries, have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.\"\nThe EU and its Member States ratified the Protocol in May 2002. Of the two conditions, the \"55 parties\" clause was reached on 23 May 2002 when Iceland ratified the Protocol. The ratification by Russia on 18 November 2004 satisfied the \"55%\" clause and brought the treaty into force, effective 16 February 2005, after the required lapse of 90 days.\nAs of May 2013, 191 countries and one regional economic organization (the EC) have ratified the agreement, representing over 61.6% of the 1990 emissions from Annex I countries. One of the 191 ratifying states\u2014Canada\u2014has renounced the protocol.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Convention Parties\nNon-ratification by the US.\nThe US signed the Protocol on 12 November 1998, during the Clinton presidency. To become binding in the US, however, the treaty had to be ratified by the Senate, which had already passed the 1997 non-binding Byrd-Hagel Resolution, expressing disapproval of any international agreement that did not require developing countries to make emission reductions and \"would seriously harm the economy of the United States\". The resolution passed 95\u20130. Therefore, even though the Clinton administration signed the treaty, it was never submitted to the Senate for ratification.\nAt the outset of the Bush administration, Senators Chuck Hagel, Jesse Helms, Larry Craig, and Pat Roberts wrote a letter to President George W. Bush seeking to identify his position on the Kyoto Protocol and climate change policy. In a letter dated March 13, 2001, President Bush responded that his \"Administration takes the issue of global climate change very seriously\", but that \"I oppose the Kyoto Protocol because it exempts 80 percent of the world, including major population centers such as China and India, from compliance, and would cause serious harm to the U.S. economy. The Senate's vote, 95-0, shows that there is a clear consensus that the Kyoto Protocol is an unfair and ineffective means of addressing global climate change concerns.\" The administration also questioned the scientific certainty around climate change and cited potential harms of emissions reduction to the US economy.\nThe Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research reported in 2001:This policy reversal received a massive wave of criticism that was quickly picked up by the international media. Environmental groups blasted the White House, while Europeans and Japanese alike expressed deep concern and regret. ... Almost all world leaders (e.g. China, Japan, South Africa, Pacific Islands, etc.) expressed their disappointment at Bush's decision.In response to this criticism, Bush stated: \"I was responding to reality, and reality is the nation has got a real problem when it comes to energy\". The Tyndall Centre called this \"an overstatement used to cover up the big benefactors of this policy reversal, i.e., the US oil and coal industry, which has a powerful lobby with the administration and conservative Republican congressmen.\"\nAs of 2023, the US is the only signatory that has not ratified the Protocol. The US accounted for 36.1% of emissions in 1990. As such, for the treaty to go into legal effect without US ratification, it would require a coalition including the EU, Russia, Japan, and small parties. A deal, without the US Administration, was reached in the Bonn climate talks (COP-6.5), held in 2001.\nWithdrawal of Canada.\nIn 2011, Canada, Japan and Russia stated that they would not take on further Kyoto targets. The Canadian government announced its withdrawal\u2014possible at any time three years after ratification\u2014from the Kyoto Protocol on 12 December 2011, effective 15 December 2012. Canada was committed to cutting its greenhouse emissions to 6% below 1990 levels by 2012, but in 2009 emissions were 17% higher than in 1990. The Harper government prioritized oil sands development in Alberta, and deprioritized the reduction of greenhouse emissions. Environment minister Peter Kent cited Canada's liability to \"enormous financial penalties\" under the treaty unless it withdrew. He also suggested that the recently signed Durban agreement may provide an alternative way forward. The Harper government claimed it would find a \"Made in Canada\" solution. Canada's decision received a generally negative response from representatives of other ratifying countries.\nOther states and territories where the treaty was not applicable.\nAndorra, Palestine, South Sudan, the United States and, following their withdrawal on 15 December 2012, Canada are the only UNFCCC Parties that are not party to the Protocol. Furthermore, the Protocol is not applied to UNFCCC observer the Holy See. Although the Kingdom of the Netherlands approved the protocol for the whole Kingdom, it did not deposit an instrument of ratification for Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, Sint Maarten or the Caribbean Netherlands.\nCountry types and their emissions.\nAnnex I countries.\nTotal aggregate GHG emissions excluding emissions/removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF, i.e., carbon storage in forests and soils) for all Annex I Parties (see list below) including the United States taken together decreased from 19.0 to 17.8 thousand teragrams (Tg, which is equal to 109\u00a0kg) CO2 equivalent, a decline of 6.0% during the 1990\u20132008 period. Several factors have contributed to this decline. The first is due to the economic restructuring in the Annex I Economies in Transition (the EITs \u2013 see Intergovernmental Emissions Trading for the list of EITs). Over the period 1990\u20131999, emissions fell by 40% in the EITs following the collapse of central planning in the former Soviet Union and east European countries. This led to a massive contraction of their heavy industry-based economies, with associated reductions in their fossil fuel consumption and emissions.\nEmissions growth in Annex I Parties have also been limited due to policies and measures (PaMs). In particular, PaMs were strengthened after 2000, helping to enhance energy efficiency and develop renewable energy sources. Energy use also decreased during the economic crisis in 2007\u20132008.\nAnnex I parties with targets.\nCollectively the group of industrialized countries committed to a Kyoto target, i.e., the Annex I countries excluding the US, had a target of reducing their GHG emissions by 4.2% on average for the period 2008\u20132012 relative to the base year, which in most cases is 1990.\nAs noted in the preceding section, between 1990 and 1999, there was a large reduction in the emissions of the EITs. The reduction in the EITs is largely responsible for the total (aggregate) reduction (excluding LULUCF) in emissions of the Annex I countries, excluding the US. Emissions of the Annex II countries (Annex I minus the EIT countries) have experienced a limited increase in emissions from 1990 to 2006, followed by stabilization and a more marked decrease from 2007 onwards. The emissions reductions in the early nineties by the 12 EIT countries who have since joined the EU, assist the present EU-27 in meeting its collective Kyoto target.\nIn December 2011, Canada's environment minister, Peter Kent, formally announced that Canada would withdraw from the Kyoto accord a day after the end of the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference (see the section on the withdrawal of Canada).\nAnnex I parties without Kyoto targets.\nBelarus, Malta, and Turkey are Annex I Parties but did not have first-round Kyoto targets. The US had a Kyoto target of a 7% reduction relative to the 1990 level, but has not ratified the treaty. If the US had ratified the Kyoto Protocol, the average percentage reduction in total GHG emissions for the Annex I group would have been a 5.2% reduction relative to the base year.\nNon-Annex I.\nUNFCCC (2005) compiled and synthesized information reported to it by non-Annex I Parties. Most non-Annex I Parties belonged in the low-income group, with very few classified as middle-income. Most Parties included information on policies relating to sustainable development. Sustainable development priorities mentioned by non-Annex I Parties included poverty alleviation and access to basic education and health care. Many non-Annex I Parties are making efforts to amend and update their environmental legislation to include global concerns such as climate change.\nA few Parties, e.g., South Africa and Iran, stated their concern over how efforts to reduce emissions by Annex I Parties could adversely affect their economies. The economies of these countries are highly dependent on income generated from the production, processing, and export of fossil fuels.\nGHG emissions, excluding land use change and forestry (LUCF), reported by 122 non-Annex I Parties for the year 1994 or the closest year reported, totalled 11.7\u00a0billion tonnes (billion\u00a0=\u00a01,000,000,000) of CO2-eq. CO2 was the largest proportion of emissions (63%), followed by methane (26%) and nitrous oxide (N2O) (11%).\nThe energy sector was the largest source of emissions for 70 Parties, whereas for 45 Parties the agriculture sector was the largest. Per capita emissions (in tonnes of CO2-eq, excluding LUCF) averaged 2.8\u00a0tonnes for the 122 non-Annex I Parties.\nParties reported a high level of uncertainty in LUCF emissions, but in aggregate, there appeared to only be a small difference of 1.7% with and without LUCF. With LUCF, emissions were 11.9\u00a0billion\u00a0tonnes, without LUCF, total aggregate emissions were 11.7\u00a0billion\u00a0tonnes.\nProblem areas.\nViews and criticism of the Protocol.\nGupta \"et al.\" (2007) assessed the literature on climate change policy. They found that no authoritative assessments of the UNFCCC or its Protocol asserted that these agreements had, or will, succeed in solving the climate problem. In these assessments, it was assumed that the UNFCCC or its Protocol would not be changed. The Framework Convention and its Protocol include provisions for future policy actions to be taken.\nGupta \"et al.\" (2007) described the Kyoto first-round commitments as \"modest\", stating that they acted as a constraint on the treaty's effectiveness. It was suggested that subsequent Kyoto commitments could be made more effective with measures aimed at achieving deeper cuts in emissions, as well as having policies applied to a larger share of global emissions. In 2008, countries with a Kyoto cap made up less than one-third of annual global carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion.\nWorld Bank (2010) commented on how the Kyoto Protocol had only had a slight effect on curbing global emissions growth. The treaty was negotiated in 1997, but in 2006, energy-related carbon dioxide emissions had grown by 24%. World Bank (2010) also stated that the treaty had provided only limited financial support to developing countries to assist them in reducing their emissions and adapting to climate change.\nSome environmentalists have supported the Kyoto Protocol because it is \"the only game in town\", and possibly because they expect that future emission reduction commitments may demand more stringent emission reductions (Aldy \"et al.\"., 2003, p.\u00a09). In 2001, seventeen national science academies stated that ratification of the Protocol represented a \"small but essential first step towards stabilising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.\" Some environmentalists and scientists have criticized the existing commitments for being too weak (Grubb, 2000, p.\u00a05).\nThe United States (under former President George W. Bush) and Australia (initially, under former Prime Minister John Howard) did not ratify the Kyoto treaty. According to Stern (2006), their decision was based on the lack of quantitative emission commitments for emerging economies (see also the 2000 onwards section). Australia, under former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, has since ratified the treaty, which took effect in March 2008.\nCompliance.\n38 developed countries committed to limiting their greenhouse gas emissions. Because the United States did not ratify and Canada withdrew, the emission limits remained in force for 36 countries. All of them complied with the Protocol. However, nine countries (Austria, Denmark, Iceland, Japan, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain and Switzerland) had to resort to the flexibility mechanisms because their national emissions were slightly greater than their targets.\nIn total, the 36 countries that fully participated in the Protocol were committed to reducing their aggregate emissions by 4% from the 1990 base year. Their average annual emissions in 2008\u20132012 were 24.2% below the 1990 level. Hence, they surpassed their aggregate commitment by a large margin. If the United States and Canada are included, the emissions decreased by 11.8%. The large reductions were mainly thanks to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which reduced the emissions of the Eastern Bloc by tens of percents in the early 1990s. In addition, the 2008 financial crisis significantly reduced emissions during the first Kyoto commitment period.\nThe 36 countries that were committed to emission reductions only accounted for 24% of the global greenhouse gas emissions in 2010. Even though these countries significantly reduced their emissions during the Kyoto commitment period, other countries increased their emissions so much that the global emissions increased by 32% from 1990 to 2010.\nEmission trends in developing countries.\nIn several large developing countries and fast growing economies (China, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Egypt, and Iran) GHG emissions have increased rapidly (PBL, 2009). For example, emissions in China have risen strongly over the 1990\u20132005 period, often by more than 10% year. Emissions per-capita in non-Annex I countries are still, for the most part, much lower than in industrialized countries. Non-Annex I countries do not have quantitative emission reduction commitments, but they are committed to mitigation actions. China, for example, has had a national policy programme to reduce emissions growth, which included the closure of old, less efficient coal-fired power plants.\nViews on the flexibility mechanisms.\nAnother area which has been commented on is the role of the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms \u2013 carbon emission trading, Joint Implementation, and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The flexibility mechanisms have attracted both positive and negative comments.\nOne of the arguments made in favour of the flexibility mechanisms is that they can reduce the costs incurred by Annex I Parties in meeting their Kyoto commitments. Criticisms of flexibility have, for example, included the ineffectiveness of emissions trading in promoting investment in non-fossil energy sources, and adverse impacts of CDM projects on local communities in developing countries.\nChina, India, Indonesia and Brazil were not required to reduce their CO2 emissions. The remaining signatory countries were not obliged to implement a common framework nor specific measures, but to reach an emission reduction target for which they can benefit of a secondary market for carbon credits multilaterally exchanged from each other. The Emissions-trading Scheme (ETS) allowed countries to host polluting industries and to buy from other countries the property of their environmental merits and virtuous patterns.\nA 2021 review considers both the institutional design and the political strategies that have affected the adoption of the Kyoto protocol. It concludes that the Kyoto protocol's relatively small impact on global carbon dioxide emissions reflects a number of factors, including \"deliberate political strategy, unequal power, and the absence of leadership\" among and within nations. The efforts of fossil fuel interests and conservative think tanks to spread disinformation and climate change denial have influenced public opinion and political action both within the United States and beyond it. The direct lobbying of fossil fuel companies and their funding of political actors have slowed political action to address climate change at regional, national, and international levels.\nAmendment and successor.\nIn the non-binding \"Washington Declaration\" agreed on 16 February 2007, heads of governments from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa agreed in principle on the outline of a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. They envisaged a global cap-and-trade system that would apply to both industrialized nations and developing countries, and initially hoped that it would be in place by 2009.\nThe United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December 2009 was one of the annual series of UN meetings that followed the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio. In 1997 the talks led to the Kyoto Protocol, and the conference in Copenhagen was considered to be the opportunity to agree a successor to Kyoto that would bring about meaningful carbon cuts.\nThe 2010 Canc\u00fan agreements include voluntary pledges made by 76 developed and developing countries to control their emissions of greenhouse gases. In 2010, these 76 countries were collectively responsible for 85% of annual global emissions.\nBy May 2012, the US, Japan, Russia, and Canada had indicated they would not sign up to a second Kyoto commitment period. In November 2012, Australia confirmed it would participate in a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol and New Zealand confirmed that it would not.\nNew Zealand's climate minister Tim Groser said the 15-year-old Kyoto Protocol was outdated, and that New Zealand was \"ahead of the curve\" in looking for a replacement that would include developing nations. Non-profit environmental organisations such as the World Wildlife Fund criticised New Zealand's decision to pull out.\nOn 8 December 2012, at the end of the 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference, an agreement was reached to extend the Protocol to 2020 and to set a date of 2015 for the development of a successor document, to be implemented from 2020 (see lede for more information). The outcome of the Doha talks has received a mixed response, with small island states critical of the overall package. The Kyoto second commitment period applies to about 11% of annual global emissions of greenhouse gases. Other results of the conference include a timetable for a global agreement to be adopted by 2015 which includes all countries. At the Doha meeting of the parties to the UNFCCC on 8 December 2012, the European Union chief climate negotiator, Artur Runge-Metzger, pledged to extend the treaty, binding on the 27 European Member States, up to the year 2020 pending an internal ratification procedure.\nBan Ki Moon, Secretary General of the United Nations, called on world leaders to come to an agreement on halting global warming during the 69th Session of the UN General Assembly on 23 September 2014 in New York. The next climate summit was held in Paris in 2015, out of which emerged the Paris Agreement, the successor to the Kyoto Protocol.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The central theme of the Kaddish is the magnification and sanctification of God's name. In the liturgy, different versions of the Kaddish are functionally chanted or sung as separators of the different sections of the service.\nThe term \"Kaddish\" is often used to refer specifically to the Mourner's Kaddish, which is chanted as part of the mourning rituals in Judaism in all prayer services, as well as at funerals (other than at the gravesite) and memorials; for 11 Hebrew months after the death of a parent; and in some communities for 30 days after the death of a spouse, sibling, or child. A person is described as \"saying Kaddish\" if they are carrying out these rituals of mourning. Mourners recite Kaddish to show that despite the loss they still praise God.\nAlong with the Shema Yisrael and the Amidah, the Kaddish is one of the most important and central elements in the Jewish liturgy. Kaddish is traditionally only recited with a minyan - a quorum of ten adult Jews.\nVariant forms.\nThe various versions of the Kaddish are as follows. Each one generally has a descriptive name and an alternative name which points to a word which appears in that version of Kaddish.\nAll versions of the Kaddish begin with the text of the \"Chatzi Kaddish\" (in the case of the Great Kaddish, with an extra passage inserted). The other versions contain additional paragraphs, and are often named after distinctive words in those paragraphs.\nHistorically there existed another type of Kaddish, called \"Kaddish Yachid\" (\"Individual's Kaddish\"). This is included in the \"Siddur of Amram Gaon\", but is a meditation taking the place of Kaddish rather than a Kaddish in the normal sense. It had not been recited in modern times until the COVID-19 pandemic, which made coming together to form a minyan difficult. Some communities began reciting the \"Kaddish Yachid\", or a portion thereof, in lieu of the Mourner's Kaddish.\nText.\nThe following includes the Half, Complete, Mourner's and Rabbis' Kaddish. The variant lines of the Great Kaddish are given below, as well as variants used by some Jewish communities.\nText of the burial kaddish.\nIn the burial kaddish, and that after a siyum according to Ashkenazim,i, lines 2-3 are replaced by:\nRecent changes to Oseh Shalom.\nIn some recent non-Orthodox prayerbooks, for example, the American Reform Machzor, line 36 is replaced with:\nThis effort to extend the reach of Oseh Shalom to non-Jews is said to have been started by the British Liberal Jewish movement in 1967, with the introduction of \"v'al kol bnei Adam\" (\"and upon all humans\"); these words continue to be used by some in the UK.\nAnalysis of the text.\nThe opening words of the Kaddish are inspired by the vision in Ezekiel 38:23 of God becoming great in the eyes of all the nations.\nThe central line of the Kaddish is the congregation's response: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05b5\u05d0 \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05b5\u05d4\u05bc \u05e8\u05b7\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d0 \u05de\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05e8\u05b7\u05da\u05b0 \u05dc\u05b0\u05e2\u05b8\u05dc\u05b7\u05dd \u05d5\u05bc\u05dc\u05b0\u05e2\u05b8\u05dc\u05b0\u05de\u05b5\u05d9 \u05e2\u05b8\u05dc\u05b0\u05de\u05b7\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05d0\u200e (\"Yehei shmeih rabba mevarakh lealam ulealemai alemaya\", \"May His great name be blessed for ever, and to all eternity\"), a public declaration of God's greatness and eternality. This response is similar to the wording of Daniel 2:20. It is also parallel to the Hebrew \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05da\u05b0 \u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05dd \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d3 \u05de\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05db\u05d5\u05bc\u05ea\u05d5\u05b9 \u05dc\u05b0\u05e2\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc\u05b8\u05dd \u05d5\u05b8\u05e2\u05b6\u05d3\u200e\" ('Blessed be the name is His glorious kingdom forever and ever]], which is commonly recited after the first verse of the Shema. Aramaic versions of both wordings appear in the various versions of Targum Pseudo-Jonathan to Genesis 49:2 and Deuteronomy 6:4.\nThe Mourner's, Rabbis' and Complete Kaddish end with a supplication for peace (\"Oseh Shalom...\"), which is in Hebrew, and is somewhat similar to the Tanakh Job 25:2.\nKaddish does not contain God's name. It is said that this is because the first section of Kaddish has 26 words, equalling the \"gematria\" (numerological value) of the Tetragrammaton, and the Kaddish text proves that from the very beginning with words \"May His great name be exalted and sanctified\".\nCustoms.\nKaddish may be spoken or chanted. In services on certain special occasions, it may be sung to special melodies. There are different melodies in different Jewish traditions, and within each tradition the melody can change according to the version, the day it is said and even the position in the service. Many mourners recite Kaddish slowly and contemplatively.\nIn Sephardi synagogues the whole congregation sits for Kaddish, except:\nIn Ashkenazi synagogues, the custom varies. Very commonly, in both Orthodox and Reform congregations, everyone stands for the Mourner's Kaddish; but in some (especially many Conservative and Sephardic) synagogues, most of the congregants sit. Sometimes, a distinction is made between the different forms of Kaddish, or each congregant stands or sits according to his or her own custom. The Mourner's Kaddish is often treated differently from the other variations of Kaddish in the service, as is the Half Kaddish after a morning Torah reading.\nThose standing to recite Kaddish bow, by widespread tradition, at various places. This generally includes the first word of the prayer, at each \"Amen\", at \"Yitbarakh\", at \"Brikh hu\", and for the last verse \"Oseh shalom\". For \"Oseh shalom\" it is customary to take three steps back then bow to one's left, then to one's right, and finally bow forward, as if taking leave of the presence of a king, in the same way as when the same words are used as the concluding line of the Amidah.\nAccording to the original Ashkenazic custom, as well as the Yemenite custom, one mourner recites each Kaddish, and the Halachic authorities set down extensive rules to determine who has priority for each kaddish. Most (but not all) Ashkenazic communities have adopted the Sephardic custom to allow multiple mourners to recite Kaddish together.\nMinyan requirement.\n\"Masekhet Soferim\", an eighth-century compilation of Jewish laws regarding the preparation of holy books and public reading, states in 10:7 that Kaddish may be recited only in the presence of a minyan - a quorum of ten. The traditional view is that \"If \"kaddish\" is said in private, then by definition it is not \"kaddish\"\". \nHowever some alternatives have been suggested, including the \"Kaddish l'yachid\" \"Kaddish for an individual\", attributed to the ninth-century Amram Gaon, and the use of kavanah prayer, asking heavenly beings to join with the individual \"to make a minyan of both Earth and heaven\". In some Reform congregations, a minyan is not required for recitation of the Kaddish, but other Reform congregations disagree and believe that the Kaddish should be said publicly.\nHistory and background.\nDavid de Silva Pool describes the origin of Kaddish as \"a closing doxology to an Aggadic discourse.\" Most of it is written in Aramaic which, at the time of its original composition, was the lingua franca of the Jewish people. It is not composed in the vernacular Aramaic, however, but rather in a \"literary, jargon Aramaic\" that was used in the academies, and is identical to the dialect of the Targumim.\nProfessor Yoel Elitzur, however, argues that the Kaddish was originally written in Hebrew, and later translated to Aramaic to be better understood by the masses. He notes that quotations from the Kaddish in the Talmud and Sifrei are in Hebrew, and that even today some of the words are Hebrew rather than Aramaic.\nThe oldest version of the Kaddish is found in the \"Siddur of Rab Amram Gaon\", c. 900. \"The first mention of mourners reciting Kaddish at the end of the service is in a thirteenth century halakhic writing called the Or Zarua. The Kaddish at the end of the service became designated as Kaddish Yatom or Mourner's Kaddish (literally, \"Orphan's Kaddish\").\"\nThe Kaddish was not always recited by mourners and instead became a prayer for mourners sometime between the 12th and 13th centuries when it started to be associated with a medieval legend about Rabbi Akiva who meets a dead man seeking redemption in the afterlife.\nHebrew reconstruction.\nElitzur made an attempt at reconstructing the theorized original Hebrew version of Kaddish:\n \u05d9\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05d2\u05b7\u05bc\u05d3\u05b5\u05bc\u05dc \u05d5\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05e7\u05b7\u05d3\u05b5\u05bc\u05e9\u05c1 \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05d5\u05b9 \u05d4\u05b7\u05d2\u05b8\u05bc\u05d3\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc\n \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e2\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc\u05b8\u05dd \u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0 \u05db\u05b4\u05bc\u05e8\u05b0\u05e6\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05d5\u05b9\n \u05d5\u05b0\u05ea\u05b4\u05de\u05dc\u05d5\u05b9\u05da\u05b0 \u05de\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05db\u05d5\u05bc\u05ea\u05d5\u05b9 \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05d7\u05b7\u05d9\u05b5\u05bc\u05d9\u05db\u05b6\u05dd \u05d5\u05bc\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05de\u05b5\u05d9\u05db\u05b6\u05dd \u05d5\u05bc\u05d1\u05b0\u05d7\u05b7\u05d9\u05b5\u05bc\u05d9\u05d4\u05b6\u05dd \u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05dc \u05db\u05b9\u05bc\u05dc \u05d1\u05b5\u05bc\u05d9\u05ea \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc \u05d1\u05b4\u05bc\u05de\u05b0\u05d4\u05b5\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d5\u05bc\u05d1\u05b4\u05d6\u05b0\u05de\u05b7\u05df \u05e7\u05b8\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05d1\n \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9 \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05d5\u05b9 \u05d4\u05b7\u05d2\u05b8\u05bc\u05d3\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc \u05de\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05b8\u05da\u05b0 \u05dc\u05b0\u05e2\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc\u05b8\u05dd \u05d5\u05bc\u05dc\u05b0\u05e2\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc\u05b0\u05de\u05b5\u05d9 \u05e2\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc\u05b8\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd\nMourner's Kaddish.\nMourner's Kaddish is said in most communities at all prayer services and certain other occasions. It is written in Aramaic. It is traditionally recited several times, most prominently at or towards the end of the service, after the Aleinu, closing Psalms or, on the Sabbath, following the \"Anim Zemirot\" hymn. In most communities, Kaddish is recited during the eleven months after the death of a parent, and then at every anniversary of the death (the Yahrzeit). Technically, there is no obligation to recite Kaddish for other relatives, even though there is an obligation to mourn for them.\nCustoms for reciting the Mourner's Kaddish vary markedly among various communities. In Sephardi synagogues, the custom is that all the mourners stand and chant the Kaddish together. In Ashkenazi synagogues before the 19th century, one mourner was chosen to lead the prayer on behalf of the rest, but gradually over the last two centuries, most (but certainly not all) communities have adopted the Sephardi custom. In many Reform synagogues, the entire congregation recites the Mourner's Kaddish together. This is sometimes said to be for those victims of the Holocaust who have no one left to recite the Mourner's Kaddish on their behalf and in support of the mourners. In some congregations (especially Reform and Conservative ones), the Rabbi reads a list of the deceased who have a Yahrzeit on that day (or who have died within the past month), and then ask the congregants to name any people they are mourning for. Some synagogues, especially Orthodox and Conservative ones, multiply the number of times that the Mourner's Kaddish is recited, for example by reciting a separate Mourner's Kaddish after both Aleinu and then each closing Psalm. Other synagogues limit themselves to one Mourner's Kaddish at the end of the service. And still in other communities where they preserve the original custom to only allow one person to recite each Kaddish, the number of Kaddishim recited depends on how many mourners are present.\nNotably, the Mourner's Kaddish does not mention death at all, but instead praises God. Though the Kaddish is often popularly referred to as the \"Jewish Prayer for the Dead,\" that designation more accurately belongs to the prayer called \"El Malei Rachamim\", which specifically prays for the soul of the deceased. The Mourner's Kaddish can be more accurately represented as an expression of \"justification for judgment\" by the mourners on their loved ones' behalf. It is believed that mourners adopted this version of the Kaddish around the 13th century during harsh persecution of Jews by crusaders in Germany because of the opening messianic line about God bringing the dead back to life, although this line is no longer said in the Ashkenazi rite.\nWomen and the Mourner's Kaddish.\nThere is evidence of some women saying the Mourner's Kaddish for their parents at the grave, during shiva, and in daily prayers since the 17th century. Rabbi Yair Bacharach concluded that technically a woman can recite the Mourner's Kaddish, but since this is not the common practice, it should be discouraged. As such, women reciting kaddish is controversial in some Orthodox communities, and it is almost unheard of in Haredi communities. Nevertheless, Rabbi Aharon Soloveichik ruled that in our time, we should permit women to say Kaddish, and this is a common (but not universal) practice in Modern Orthodox circles. In 2013, the Israeli Orthodox rabbinical organization Beit Hillel issued a halachic ruling that women may say the Kaddish in memory of their deceased parents (in presence of a male minyan). In Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist Judaism, the Mourner's Kaddish is traditionally said by women who are there also counted in the minyan.\nIn the arts.\nThe Kaddish has been a particularly common theme and reference point in the arts, including the following:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16777", "revid": "1312915623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16777", "title": "Kalevala", "text": "1835 Finnish epic poem compiled by Elias L\u00f6nnrot\nThe Kalevala () is a 19th-century compilation of epic poetry, compiled by Elias L\u00f6nnrot from Finnish, Karelian and Ingrian folklore and mythology, telling a story about the Creation of the Earth, describing the controversies and retaliatory voyages between the peoples of the land of Kalevala called V\u00e4in\u00f6l\u00e4 and the land of Pohjola and their various protagonists and antagonists, as well as the construction and robbery of the mythical wealth-making machine Sampo.\nThe \"Kalevala\" is regarded as the national epic of Finland and Karelia, and is one of the most significant works of Finnish literature along with J. L. Runeberg's \"The Tales of Ensign St\u00e5l\" and Aleksis Kivi's \"The Seven Brothers\". The \"Kalevala\" was instrumental in the development of the Finnish national identity and the intensification of Finland's language strife that ultimately led to Finland's independence from Russia in 1917. The work is known internationally and has partly influenced, for example, J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium (i.e. Middle-earth mythology, especially \"The Children of H\u00farin\").\nThe first version of the \"Kalevala\", called the \"Old Kalevala\", was published in 1835, consisting of 12,078 verses. The version most commonly known today was first published in 1849 and consists of 22,795 verses, divided into fifty folk stories (). An abridged version, containing all fifty poems but just 9,732 verses, was published in 1862. In connection with the \"Kalevala\", there is another much more lyrical collection of poems, also compiled by L\u00f6nnrot, called \"Kanteletar\" from 1840, which is mostly seen as a \"sister collection\" of the \"Kalevala\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCollection and compilation.\nElias L\u00f6nnrot.\nElias L\u00f6nnrot (9 April 1802 \u2013 19 March 1884) was a physician, botanist, linguist, and poet. At the time he was compiling the \"Kalevala\" he was the district health officer based in Kajaani responsible for the whole Kainuu region in the eastern part of what was then the Grand Duchy of Finland. He was the son of Fredrik Johan L\u00f6nnrot, a tailor, and Ulrika L\u00f6nnrot; he was born in the village of Sammatti, Uusimaa.\nAt the age of 21, he entered the Imperial Academy of Turku and obtained a master's degree in 1826. His thesis was entitled \"De Vainamoine priscorum fennorum numine\" (\"V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen, a Divinity of the Ancient Finns\"). The monograph's second volume was destroyed in the Great Fire of Turku the same year.\nIn the spring of 1828, he set out with the aim of collecting folk songs and poetry. Rather than continue this work, though, he decided to complete his studies and entered Imperial Alexander University in Helsinki to study medicine. He earned a master's degree in 1832. In January 1833, he started as the district health officer of Kainuu and began his work on collecting poetry and compiling the \"Kalevala\". Throughout his career L\u00f6nnrot made a total of eleven field trips within a period of fifteen years.\nPrior to the publication of the \"Kalevala\", Elias L\u00f6nnrot compiled several related works, including the three-part \"Kantele\" (1829\u20131831), the \"Old Kalevala\" (1835) and the \"Kanteletar\" (1840).\nL\u00f6nnrot's field trips and endeavours helped him to compile the \"Kalevala\", and brought considerable enjoyment to the people he visited; he would spend much time retelling what he had collected as well as learning new poems.\nPoetry.\nHistory.\nBefore the 18th century, \"Kalevala\" poetry, also known as runic song, was common throughout Finland and Karelia, but in the 18th century it began to disappear in Finland, first in western Finland, because European rhymed poetry became more common in Finland. Finnish folk poetry was first written down in the 17th century and collected by hobbyists and scholars through the following centuries. Despite this, the majority of Finnish poetry remained only in the oral tradition.\nFinnish-born nationalist and linguist Carl Axel Gottlund (1796\u20131875) expressed his desire for a Finnish epic in a similar vein to the \"Iliad\", \"Ossian\" and the \"Nibelungenlied\" compiled from the various poems and songs spread over most of Finland. He hoped that such an endeavour would incite a sense of nationality and independence in the native Finnish people. In 1820, Reinhold von Becker founded the journal \"Turun Wiikko-Sanomat\" (Turku Weekly News) and published three articles entitled \"V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6isest\u00e4\" (\"Concerning V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen\"). These works were an inspiration for Elias L\u00f6nnrot in creating his masters thesis at Turku University.\nIn the 19th century, collecting became more extensive, systematic and organised. Altogether, almost half a million pages of verse have been collected and archived by the Finnish Literature Society and other collectors in what are now Estonia and Russia's Republic of Karelia. The publication \"Suomen Kansan Vanhat Runot\" (\"Ancient Poems of the Finns\") published 33 volumes containing 85,000 items of poetry over a period of 40 years. They have archived 65,000 items of poetry that remain unpublished. By the end of the 19th century this pastime of collecting material relating to Karelia and the developing orientation towards eastern lands had become a fashion called Karelianism, a form of national romanticism.\nThe chronology of this oral tradition is uncertain. The oldest themes, the origin of Earth, have been interpreted to have their roots in distant, unrecorded history and could be as old as 3,000 years.\nThe newest events, e.g. the arrival of Christianity, seem to be from the Iron Age, which in Finland lasted until c. 1300 CE. Finnish folklorist Kaarle Krohn proposes that 20 of the 45 poems of the \"Kalevala\" are of possible Ancient Estonian origin or at least deal with a motif of Estonian origin (of the remainder, two are Ingrian and 23 are Western Finnish).\nIt is understood that during the Finnish reformation in the 16th century the clergy forbade all telling and singing of pagan rites and stories. In conjunction with the arrival of European poetry and music this caused a significant reduction in the number of traditional folk songs and their singers. Thus the tradition faded somewhat but was never totally eradicated.\nL\u00f6nnrot's field trips.\nIn total, L\u00f6nnrot made eleven field trips in search of poetry. His first trip was made in 1828 after his graduation from Turku University, but it was not until 1831 and his second field trip that the real work began. By that time he had already published three articles entitled \"Kantele\" and had significant notes to build upon. This second trip was not very successful and he was called back to Helsinki to attend to victims of the Second cholera pandemic.\nThe third field trip was much more successful and led Elias L\u00f6nnrot to Viena in east Karelia where he visited the town of Akonlahti, which proved most successful. This trip yielded over 3,000 verses and copious notes. In 1833, L\u00f6nnrot moved to Kajaani where he was to spend the next 20 years as the district health officer for the region, living in the H\u00f6vel\u00f6 croft located near the Lake Ouluj\u00e4rvi in the Paltaniemi village, spending his spare time searching for poems. His fourth field trip was undertaken in conjunction with his work as a doctor; a 10-day jaunt into Viena. This trip resulted in 49 poems and almost 3,000 new lines of verse. It was during this trip that L\u00f6nnrot formulated the idea that the poems might represent a wider continuity, when poem entities were performed to him along with comments in normal speech connecting them.\nOn the fifth field trip, L\u00f6nnrot met Arhippa Perttunen who, over two days of continuous recitation, provided him with some 4,000 verses for the \"Kalevala\". He also met a singer called Matiska in the hamlet of Lonkka on the Russian side of the border. Although this singer had a somewhat poor memory, he did help to fill in many gaps in the work L\u00f6nnrot had already catalogued. This trip resulted in the discovery of almost 300 poems at just over 13,000 verses.\nIn the autumn of 1834, L\u00f6nnrot had written the vast majority of the work needed for what was to become the \"Old Kalevala\"; all that was required was to tie up some narrative loose ends and complete the work. His sixth field trip took him into Kuhmo, a municipality in Kainuu to the south of Viena. There he collected over 4,000 verses and completed the first draft of his work. He wrote the foreword and published in February of the following year.\nWith the \"Old Kalevala\" well into its first publication run, L\u00f6nnrot decided to continue collecting poems to supplement his existing work and to understand the culture more completely. The seventh field trip took him on a long winding path through the southern and eastern parts of the Viena poem singing region. He was delayed significantly in Kuhmo because of bad skiing conditions. By the end of that trip, L\u00f6nnrot had collected another 100 poems consisting of over 4,000 verses. L\u00f6nnrot made his eighth field trip to the Russian border town of Lapukka where the great singer Arhippa Perttunen had learned his trade. In correspondence he notes that he has written down many new poems but is unclear on the quantity.\nElias L\u00f6nnrot departed on the first part of his ninth field trip on 16 September 1836. He was granted a 14-month leave of absence and a sum of travelling expenses from the Finnish Literary Society. His funds came with some stipulations: he must travel around the Kainuu border regions and then on to the north and finally from Kainuu to the south-east along the border. For the expedition into the north he was accompanied by Juhana Fredrik Cajan. The first part of the trip took L\u00f6nnrot all the way to Inari in northern Lapland. The second, southern part of the journey was more successful than the northern part, taking L\u00f6nnrot to the town of Sortavala on Lake Ladoga then back up through Savo and eventually back to Kajaani. Although these trips were long and arduous, they resulted in very little Kalevala material; only 1,000 verses were recovered from the southern half and an unknown quantity from the northern half.\nThe tenth field trip is a relative unknown. What is known however, is that L\u00f6nnrot intended to gather poems and songs to compile into the upcoming work \"Kanteletar\". He was accompanied by his friend C. H. St\u00e5hlberg for the majority of the trip. During that journey the pair met Mateli Magdalena Kuivalatar in the small border town of Ilomantsi. Kuivalatar was very important to the development of the \"Kanteletar\". The eleventh documented field trip was another undertaken in conjunction with his medical work. During the first part of the trip, L\u00f6nnrot returned to Akonlahti in Russian Karelia, where he gathered 80 poems and a total of 800 verses. The rest of the trip suffers from poor documentation.\nMethodology.\nL\u00f6nnrot and his contemporaries, e.g. Matthias Castr\u00e9n, Anders Johan Sj\u00f6gren,\nand David Emmanuel Daniel Europaeus collected most of the poem variants; one poem could easily have countless variants, scattered across rural areas of Karelia and Ingria. L\u00f6nnrot was not really interested in, and rarely wrote down the name of the singer except for some of the more prolific cases. His primary purpose in the region was that of a physician and of an editor, not of a biographer or counsellor. He rarely knew anything in-depth about the singer himself and primarily only catalogued verse that could be relevant or of some use in his work.\nThe student David Emmanuel Daniel Europaeus is credited with discovering and cataloguing the majority of the Kullervo story.\nOf the dozens of poem singers who contributed to the \"Kalevala\", significant ones are:\nForm and structure.\nThe poetry was often sung to music built on a pentachord, sometimes assisted by a kantele player. The rhythm could vary but the music was arranged in either two or four lines in metre. The poems were often performed by a duo, each person singing alternative verses or groups of verses. This method of performance is called an antiphonic performance, it is a kind of \"singing match\".\nMetre.\nDespite the vast geographical distance and customary spheres separating individual singers, the folk poetry the \"Kalevala\" is based on was always sung in the same metre.\nThe \"Kalevala\"'s metre is a form of trochaic tetrameter that is now known as the \"Kalevala metre\". The metre is thought to have originated during the Proto-Finnic period. Its syllables fall into three types: strong, weak, and neutral. Its main rules are as follows:\nIn the second, third, and fourth foot of a line, a strong syllable can occur in only the rising part:\n (1:11)\n (\"Dearest friend, and much-loved brother\")\nThe first foot has a freer structure, allowing strong syllables in a falling position as well as a rising one:\n (1:37)\n (\"These my father sang aforetime\")\nIn the second, third, and fourth feet, a weak syllable can occur only in the falling part:\n (1:1)\n (\"I am driven by my longing\")\nAgain, the first foot's structure is more free, allowing weak syllables in a rising position as well as a falling one:\n (1:56)\n (\"Others taken from the saplings\")\nThere are two main types of line:\nTraditional poetry in the Kalevala metre uses both types with approximately the same frequency. The alternating normal and broken tetrameters is a characteristic difference between the Kalevala metre and other forms of trochaic tetrameter.\nThere are four additional rules:\nSchemes.\nThere are two main schemes featured in the \"Kalevala\":\nAlliteration can be broken into two forms. Weak: where only the opening consonant is the same, and strong: where both the first vowel or vowel and consonant are the same in the different words. (e.g. ).\nParallelism in \"The Kalevala\" refers to the stylistic feature of repeating the idea presented in the previous line, often by using synonyms, rather than moving the plot forward. (e.g. ). L\u00f6nnrot has been criticised for overusing parallelism in \"The Kalevala\": in the original poems, a line was usually followed by only one such parallel line.\nThe verses are sometimes inverted into chiasmus.\nPoetry example.\nVerses 221 to 232 of song forty.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nL\u00f6nnrot's contribution to the \"Kalevala\".\nVery little is actually known about Elias L\u00f6nnrot's personal contributions to the \"Kalevala\". Scholars to this day still argue about how much of the \"Kalevala\" is genuine folk poetry and how much is L\u00f6nnrot's own work \u2013 and the degree to which the text is 'authentic' to the oral tradition. During the compilation process it is known that he merged poem variants and characters together, left out verses that did not fit and composed lines of his own to connect certain passages into a logical plot. Similarly, as was normal in the preliterate conventions of oral poetry\u2014according to the testimony of Arhippa Perttunen\u2014traditional bards in his father's days would always vary the language of songs from performance to performance when reciting from their repertoire.\nThe Finnish historian V\u00e4in\u00f6 Kaukonen suggests that 3% of the 's lines are L\u00f6nnrot's own composition, 14% are L\u00f6nnrot compositions from variants, 50% are verses which L\u00f6nnrot kept mostly unchanged except for some minor alterations, and 33% are original unedited oral poetry.\nPublishing.\nFinnish language.\nThe first version of L\u00f6nnrot's compilation was entitled \"Kalewala, taikka Wanhoja Karjalan Runoja Suomen Kansan muinoisista ajoista\" (\"The Kalevala, or old Karelian poems about ancient times of the Finnish people\"), also known as the \"Old Kalevala\". It was published in two volumes in 1835\u20131836. The \"Old Kalevala\" consisted of 12,078 verses making up a total of thirty-two poems.\nEven after the publication of the \"Old Kalevala\" L\u00f6nnrot continued to collect new material for several years. He later integrated this additional material, with significantly edited existing material, into a second version, the \"Kalevala\". This \"New Kalevala\", published in 1849, contains fifty poems, with a number of plot differences compared with the first version, and is the standard text of the \"Kalevala\" read and translated to this day. (Published as: Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seuran Toimituksia. 14 Osa. KALEVALA.)\nThe word \"Kalevala\" rarely appears in the original folk songs. The first appearance of the word in folk songs was recorded in April 1836. L\u00f6nnrot chose it as the title for his project sometime at the end of 1834, but his choice was not random. The name \"Kalev\" appears in Finnic and Baltic folklore in many locations, and the \"Sons of Kalev\" are known throughout Finnish and Estonian folklore.\nL\u00f6nnrot produced \"Lyhennetty laitos\", an abridged version of the Kalevala, in 1862. It was intended for use in schools. It retains all 50 poems from the 1849 version, but omits more than half of the verses.\nTranslations.\nOf the few complete translations into English, it is only the older translations by John Martin Crawford (1888) and William Forsell Kirby (1907) which attempt to strictly follow the original (Kalevala metre) of the poems.\nA notable partial translation of Franz Anton Schiefner's German translation was made by Prof. John Addison Porter in 1868 and published by Leypoldt &amp; Holt.\nEdward Taylor Fletcher, a British-born Canadian literature enthusiast, translated selections of the \"Kalevala\" in 1869. He read them before the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec on 17 March 1869.\nFrancis Peabody Magoun published a scholarly translation of the \"Kalevala\" in 1963 written entirely in prose. The appendices of this version contain notes on the history of the poem, comparisons between the original \"Old Kalevala\" and the current version, and a detailed glossary of terms and names used in the poem. Magoun translated the \"Old Kalevala\", which was published six years later entitled \"The Old Kalevala and Certain Antecedents\".\nEino Friberg's 1988 translation uses the original metre selectively but in general is more attuned to pleasing the ear than being an exact metrical translation; it also often reduces the length of songs for aesthetic reasons. In the introduction to his 1989 translation, Keith Bosley stated: \"The only way I could devise of reflecting the vitality of Kalevala metre was to invent my own, based on syllables rather than feet. While translating over 17,000 lines of Finnish folk poetry before I started on the epic, I found that a line settled usually into seven syllables of English, often less, occasionally more. I eventually arrived at seven, five and nine syllables respectively, using the \"impair\" (odd number) as a formal device and letting the stresses fall where they would.\"\nMost recently, Finnish/Canadian author and translator Kaarina Brooks translated into English the complete runic versions of \"Old Kalevala\" 1835 (Wisteria Publications 2020) and \"Kalevala\" (Wisteria Publications 2021). These works, unlike some previous versions, faithfully follow the Kalevala meter (Trochaic tetrameter) throughout and can be sung or chanted as Elias L\u00f6nnrot had intended. Brooks says, \"It is essential that the translation of Kalevala into any language follows the Kalevala metre, for that was how these runes were sung in times immemorial. So that readers get the full impact of these ancient runes, it is imperative that they be presented in the same chanting style.\" Kaarina Brooks is also the translator of, An Illustrated Kalevala Myths and Legends from Finland, published by Floris Books UK.\nModern translations were published in the Karelian and Urdu languages between 2009 and 2015. Thus, the \"Kalevala\" was published in its originating Karelian language only after 168 years since its first translation into Swedish.\nAs of 2010, the \"Kalevala\" had been translated into sixty-one languages and is Finland's most translated work of literature.\nThe story.\nIntroduction.\nThe \"Kalevala\" begins with the traditional Finnish creation myth, leading into stories of the creation of the earth, plants, creatures, and the sky. Creation, healing, combat and internal story telling are often accomplished by the character(s) involved singing of their exploits or desires. Many parts of the stories involve a character hunting or requesting lyrics (prayers) to acquire some skill, such as boatbuilding or the mastery of iron making. As well as prayer casting and singing, there are many stories of lust, romance, kidnapping and seduction. The protagonists of the stories often have to accomplish feats that are unreasonable or impossible which they often fail to achieve, leading to tragedy and humiliation.\nThe Sampo is a pivotal element of the whole work. Many actions and their consequences are caused by the Sampo itself or a character's interaction with the Sampo. It is described as a device that brings its possessor great fortune and prosperity, but its precise nature has been the subject of debate to the present day.\nCantos.\nFirst V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen Cycle.\nCantos 1 to 2: The poem begins with an introduction by the singers. The Earth is created from the shards of the egg of a sotka bird, from which the first man, V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen, is born to Ilmatar, the Holy Spirit of the Heaven.

He makes a deal with Louhi to get Ilmarinen the smith to create the Sampo. Ilmarinen refuses to go to Pohjola so V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen forces him against his will. The Sampo is forged.

At Pohjola Louhi assigns dangerous tasks to him in exchange for her daughter's hand. While hunting for the swan of Tuonela, Lemmink\u00e4inen is killed and falls into the river of death. The brush he gave to his mother begins to bleed. Remembering her son's words, she goes in search of him. With a rake given to her by Ilmarinen, she collects the pieces of Lemmink\u00e4inen scattered in the river and pieces him back together.\nSecond V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen Cycle.\nCantos 16\u201318: V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen builds a boat to travel to Pohjola once again in search of a bride.

He goes to Pohjola with his companion Tiera to exact his revenge, but Louhi freezes the seas and Lemmink\u00e4inen has to return home. When he arrives home he is reunited with his mother and vows to build larger better houses to replace the ones burned down.\nKullervo Cycle.\nCantos 31\u201336: Untamo kills his brother Kalervo's people, but spares his wife who later conceives Kullervo. Untamo sees the boy as a threat, and after trying to have him killed several times without success, sells Kullervo as a slave to Ilmarinen.

Kullervo escapes from Ilmarinen's homestead and learns from an old lady in the forest that his family is still alive, and is soon reunited with them. While returning home from paying taxes, he meets and seduces a young maiden, only to find out that she is his sister. Upon realizing this, she kills herself and Kullervo returns home distressed.

He heads for Pohjola and kidnaps the youngest daughter of Louhi. The daughter insults him so badly that he instead sings a spell to turn her into a bird and returns to Kalevala without her. He tells V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen about the prosperity and wealth that has met Pohjola's people thanks to the Sampo.\nTheft of the Sampo.\nCantos 39\u201344: V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen, Ilmarinen and Lemmink\u00e4inen sail to Pohjola to recover the Sampo. While on their journey they kill a monstrous pike and from its jaw bone the first is made, with which V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen sings so beautifully even deities gather to listen. The heroes arrive in Pohjola and demand a share of the Sampo's wealth or they will take the whole Sampo by force. Louhi musters her army; however, V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen lulls everyone in Pohjola to sleep with his music. The Sampo is taken from its vault of stone and the heroes set out for home. Louhi conjures a great army, turns herself into a massive eagle and fights for the Sampo. In the battle the Sampo is lost to the sea and destroyed.\nLouhi's Revenge on Kalevala.\nCantos 45\u201349: Enraged at the loss of the Sampo, Louhi sends the people of Kalevala diseases and a great bear to kill their cattle. She hides the sun and the moon and steals fire from Kalevala. V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen heals all of the ailments and, with Ilmarinen, restores the fire. V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen forces Louhi to return the Sun and the Moon to the skies.\nMarjatta cycle.\nCanto 50: The shy young virgin Marjatta becomes impregnated from a lingonberry she ate while tending to her flock.

The child is then baptised King of Karelia. V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen sails away leaving only his songs and kantele as legacy but vowing to return when there's no moon or sun and happiness isn't free anymore.\nThe poem ends and the singers sing a farewell and thank their audience.\nCharacters.\nV\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen.\nV\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen, the central character of \"The Kalevala\", is a shamanistic hero with a magical power of song and music similar to that of Orpheus. He is born of Ilmatar and contributes to the creation of Earth as it is today. Many of his travels resemble shamanistic journeys, most notably one where he visits the belly of a ground-giant, Antero Vipunen, to find the songs of boat building. V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen's search for a wife is a central element in many stories, but he never finds one.\nV\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen is associated with playing a , a Finnish stringed instrument that resembles and is played like a zither.\nIlmarinen.\nSeppo Ilmarinen is a heroic artificer (comparable to the Germanic Weyland and the Greek Daedalus). He crafted the dome of the sky, the Sampo and various other magical devices featured in \"The Kalevala\". Ilmarinen, like V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen, also has many stories told of his search for a wife, reaching the point where he forges one of gold.\nLemmink\u00e4inen.\nLemmink\u00e4inen, a handsome, arrogant and reckless seducer, is the son of . He has a close relationship with his mother, who revives him after he has been drowned in the river of Tuonela while pursuing the object of his romantic desires.\nUkko.\n is the god of sky and thunder, and the leading deity mentioned within \"The Kalevala\". He corresponds to Thor and Zeus.\nJoukahainen.\nJoukahainen is a base young man who arrogantly challenges V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen to a singing contest, which he loses. In exchange for his life Joukahainen promises his young sister Aino to V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen. Joukahainen attempts to gain his revenge on V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen by killing him with a crossbow, but only succeeds in killing V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen's horse. Joukahainen's actions lead to V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen promising to build a Sampo in return for Louhi rescuing him.\nLouhi.\nLouhi, the Mistress of the North, is the shamanistic matriarch of the people of Pohjola, a people rivalling those of Kalevala. She is the cause of much trouble for Kalevala and its people.\nLouhi at one point saves V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen's life. She has many daughters whom the heroes of Kalevala make many attempts, some successful, to seduce. Louhi plays a major part in the battle to prevent the heroes of Kalevala from stealing back the Sampo, which as a result is ultimately destroyed. She is a powerful witch with a skill almost on a par with that of V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen.\nKullervo.\nKullervo is the vengeful, mentally ill, tragic son of Kalervo. He was abused as a child and sold into slavery to Ilmarinen. He is put to work and treated badly by Ilmarinen's wife, whom he later kills. Kullervo is a misguided and troubled youth, at odds with himself and his situation. He often goes into berserk rage, and in the end commits suicide.\nMarjatta.\nMarjatta is a young virgin of Kalevala. She becomes pregnant from eating a lingonberry. When her labour begins she is expelled from her parents' home and leaves to find a place where she can sauna and give birth. She is turned away from numerous places but finally finds a place in the forest and gives birth to a son. Marjatta's nature, impregnation and searching for a place to give birth are in allegory to the Virgin Mary and the Christianisation of Finland. Marjatta's son is later condemned to death by V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen for being born out of wedlock. The boy in turn chastises V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen and is later crowned King of Karelia. This angers V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen, who leaves Kalevala after bequeathing his songs and kantele to the people as his legacy.\nInfluence.\nThe \"Kalevala\" is a major part of Finnish culture and history. It has influenced the arts in Finland and in other cultures around the world. In 2024, the European Commission granted the epic with a European Heritage Label.\nFinnish daily life.\nThe influence of the \"Kalevala\" in daily life and business in Finland is tangible. Names and places associated with the \"Kalevala\" have been adopted as company and brand names and as place names.\nThere are several places within Finland with \"Kalevala\"-related names, for example: the district of Tapiola in the city of Espoo; the district of Pohjola in the city of Turku, the district of Metsola in the city of Vantaa, and the districts of Kaleva and Sampo in the city of Tampere. In addition, the Russian town of Ukhta was in 1963 renamed Kalevala. In the United States a small community founded in 1900 by Finnish immigrants is named Kaleva, Michigan; many of the street names are taken from the \"Kalevala\".\nThe banking sector of Finland has had at least three \"Kalevala\"-related brands: Sampo Bank (name changed to Danske Bank in late 2012), OP-Pohjola Group and Tapiola Bank.\nThe jewellery company Kalevala Koru was founded in 1935 on the 100th anniversary of the publication of the \"Old Kalevala\". It specialises in the production of unique and culturally important items of jewellery. It is co-owned by the Kalevala Women's League and offers artistic scholarships to a certain number of organisations and individuals every year.\nThe Finnish dairy company Valio has a brand of ice-cream named Aino, specialising in more exotic flavours than their normal brand.\nThe construction group Lemmink\u00e4inen was formed in 1910 as a roofing and asphalt company. The name was chosen specifically to emphasise that they were a wholly Finnish company. They now operate internationally.\nThe private healthcare company Mehil\u00e4inen was formed in 1909. \"Mehil\u00e4inen\" means bee in Finnish, and the name was chosen to represent the \"selfless and hardworking healer\" in the \"Kalevala\". After Lemmink\u00e4inen is drowned, his mother collects the pieces of him, but cannot bring him back to life. It is not until a bee has retrieved a drop of honey as ointment that Lemmink\u00e4inen is saved. \nFinnish calendar.\nKalevala Day is celebrated in Finland on 28 February, to celebrate the publication date of Elias L\u00f6nnrot's first version of the \"Kalevala\" in 1835. By its other official name, the day is known as the Finnish Culture Day.\nSeveral of the names in the \"Kalevala\" are celebrated as Finnish name days. The name days themselves and the dates they fall upon have no direct relationship with the \"Kalevala\" itself; however, the adoption of the names became commonplace after the release of the \"Kalevala\".\nArt.\nSeveral artists have been influenced by the \"Kalevala\", most notably Akseli Gallen-Kallela.\nIittala group's Arabia brand kilned a series of \"Kalevala\" commemorative plates, designed by Raija Uosikkinen (1923\u20132004). The series ran from 1976 to 1999, and the plates are highly sought-after collectibles.\nOne of the earliest artists to depict the \"Kalevala\" was Robert Wilhelm Ekman.\nIn 1989, the fourth full translation of the \"Kalevala\" into English was published, illustrated by Bj\u00f6rn Landstr\u00f6m.\nLiterature.\nThe \"Kalevala\" has been translated over 150 times, into over 60 different languages. (See \u00a7 translations.)\nRe-tellings.\nFinnish cartoonist Kristian Huitula illustrated a comic book adaptation of the \"Kalevala\". The \"Kalevala Graphic Novel\" contains the storyline of all the 50 chapters in original text form.\nFinnish cartoonist and children's writer Mauri Kunnas wrote and illustrated . The story is that of the \"Kalevala\", with the characters presented as anthropomorphised dogs, wolves and cats. The story deviates from the full \"Kalevala\" to make the story more appropriate for children.\nIn the late 1950s, students from the Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama performed excerpts from the Kalevala in a presentation to the poet laureate John Masefield at Oxford. Some images from this presentation can be viewed https:// .\nThe \"Kalevala\" inspired the American Disney cartoonist Don Rosa to draw a Donald Duck (who is himself a popular character in Finland) story based on the \"Kalevala\", called \"The Quest for Kalevala\". The comic was released on the 150th anniversary of the \"Kalevala\".\nWorks inspired by.\nFranz Anton Schiefner's translation of the \"Kalevala\" was one inspiration for Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 1855 poem \"The Song of Hiawatha\", which is written in a similar trochaic tetrameter.\nFriedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald's Estonian national epic \"Kalevipoeg\" was inspired by the \"Kalevala\". Both V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen and Ilmarinen are mentioned in the work, and the overall story of Kalevipoeg, Kalev's son, bears similarities to the Kullervo story.\nJ. R. R. Tolkien claimed the \"Kalevala\" as one of his sources for \"The Silmarillion\". For example, the tale of Kullervo is the basis of T\u00farin Turambar in \"Narn i Ch\u00een H\u00farin\", including the sword that speaks when the anti-hero uses it to commit suicide. Aul\u00eb, the Lord of Matter and the Master of All Crafts, was influenced by Ilmarinen, the Eternal Hammerer. Echoes of the \"Kalevala\"'s characters, V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen in particular, can be found in Tom Bombadil of \"The Lord of the Rings\".\nPoet and playwright Paavo Haavikko took influence from the \"Kalevala\", including in his poem \"Kaksikymment\u00e4 ja yksi\" (1974), and the TV drama \"Rauta-aika\" (1982).\nAmerican science fiction and fantasy authors L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt used the \"Kalevala\" as source materials for their 1953 fantasy novella \"The Wall of Serpents\". This is the fourth story in the authors' Harold Shea series, in which the hero and his companions visit various mythic and fictional worlds. In this story, the characters visit the world of the Kalevala, where they encounter characters from the epic, drawn with a skeptical eye.\nEmil Petaja was an American science fiction and fantasy author of Finnish descent. His best known works, known as the \"Otava Series\", were a series of novels based on the \"Kalevala\". The series brought Petaja readers from around the world, while his mythological approach to science fiction was discussed in scholarly papers presented at academic conferences. He has a further \"Kalevala\" based work which is not part of the series, entitled \"The Time Twister\".\nBritish fantasy author Michael Moorcock's sword and sorcery anti-hero, Elric of Melnibon\u00e9 was influenced by the character Kullervo.\nBritish fantasy author Michael Scott Rohan's \"Winter of the World\" series feature Louhi as a major antagonist and include many narrative threads from the \"Kalevela\".\nThe web comic \"A Redtail's Dream\", written and illustrated by Minna Sundberg, cites the \"Kalevala\" as an influence. (Physical edition 2014.)\nThe British science fiction writer Ian Watson's \"Books of Mana\" duology, \"Lucky's Harvest\" and \"The Fallen Moon\", both contain references to places and names from the \"Kalevala\".\nIn 2008, Vietnamese author and translator B\u00f9i Vi\u00eat Hoa published a piece of epic poetry \"The Children of Mon and Man\" (), which delves into Vietnamese folk poetry and mythology, but was partially influenced by the \"Kalevala\". The work was written mainly in Finland and the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs co-financed it.\nMusic.\nFinnish music has been greatly influenced by the \"Kalevala\", following in the tradition of the original song-poems.\nClassical music.\nThe first recorded example of a musician influenced by the \"Kalevala\" is Filip von Schantz. In 1860, he composed the Kullervo Overture. The piece premi\u00e8red at the opening of a new theatre in Helsinki on November of the same year. Von Schantz's work was followed by Robert Kajanus' \"Kullervo's Funeral March\" and the symphonic poem \"Aino\" in 1880 and 1885, respectively. \"Aino\" is credited with inspiring Jean Sibelius to investigate the richness of the \"Kalevala\". \"Die Kalewainen in Pochjola\", the first opera freely based upon the \"Kalevala\", was composed by Karl M\u00fcller-Berghaus in 1890.\nJean Sibelius is the best-known \"Kalevala\"-influenced classical composer. Twelve of Sibelius' best-known works are based upon or influenced by the \"Kalevala\", including his \"Kullervo\", a tone poem for soprano, baritone, chorus and orchestra composed in 1892. Sibelius also composed the music of to words written by Finnish soldier and writer Heikki Nurmio. The march features the line .\nOther classical composers influenced by the \"Kalevala\":\nFolk metal.\nA number of folk metal bands have drawn on the \"Kalevala\" heavily for inspiration. In 1993, the Finnish bands Amorphis and Sentenced released two concept albums, \"Tales from the Thousand Lakes\" and \"North from Here\" respectively, which were the first of many \"Kalevala\"-inspired albums that have followed since. Amorphis's 2009 album \"Skyforger\" also draws heavily on the \"Kalevala\". The Finnish folk metal band Ensiferum have released songs such as \"Old Man\" and \"Little Dreamer\", which are influenced by the \"Kalevala\". The third track of their \"Dragonheads\" EP, entitled \"Kalevala Melody\", is an instrumental piece following the rhythm of the Kalevala metre. Another Finnish folk metal band, Turisas, have adapted several verses from song nine of the \"Kalevala\", \"The Origin of Iron\", for the lyrics of their song \"Cursed Be Iron\", which is the third track of the album \"The Varangian Way\". Finnish metal band Amberian Dawn use lyrics inspired by the \"Kalevala\" on their album \"River of Tuoni\", as well as on its successor, \"The Clouds of Northland Thunder\". On 3 August 2012, Finnish folk metal band Korpiklaani released a new album entitled \"Manala\". Jonne J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 from the band said, \" is the realm of the dead \u2013 the underworld in Finnish mythology. and are used synonymously. This place is best known for its appearance in the Finnish national epic \"Kalevala\", on which many of our new songs are based.\"\nOther musical genres.\nIn the mid-1960s, the progressive rock band Kalevala was active within Finland and in 1974, the now prolific singer-songwriter Jukka Kuoppam\u00e4ki released the song \"V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen\". These were some of the first pieces of modern popular music inspired by the \"Kalevala\".\nIn 1998, Ruth MacKenzie recorded the album \"Kalevala: Dream of the Salmon Maiden\", a song cycle covering the story of Aino and her choice to refuse the hand of the sorcerer V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen, instead transforming herself into a salmon. MacKenzie has continued to perform the piece live.\nThe Karelian Finnish folk music group V\u00e4rttin\u00e4 has based some of its lyrics on motifs from the \"Kalevala\". The Vantaa Chamber Choir have songs influenced by the \"Kalevala\". Their \"Kalevala\"-themed third album, \"Marian virsi\" (2005), combines contemporary folk with traditionally performed folk poetry.\nIn 2003, the Finnish progressive rock quarterly Colossus and French Musea Records commissioned 30 progressive rock groups from around the world to compose songs based on parts of the \"Kalevala\". The publication assigned each band with a particular song from the \"Kalevala\", which the band was free to interpret as they saw fit. The result, titled \"Kalevala\", is a three-disc, multilingual, four-hour epic telling.\nIn the beginning of 2009, in celebration of the 160th anniversary of the \"Kalevala\"'s first published edition, the Finnish Literature Society and the Kalevala Society premi\u00e8red ten new and original works inspired by the \"Kalevala\". The works included poems, classical and contemporary music and artwork. A book was published by the Finnish Literature Society in conjunction with the event and a large exhibition of \"Kalevala\"-themed artwork and cultural artefacts was put on display at the Ateneum museum in Helsinki.\nIn 2017, a New York-based production \"Kalevala the Musical\" premiered in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Finland. The production featured original pop, folk and world music score written by Johanna Telander. The concert version was performed across the United States and Finland.\nFilm and television.\nIn 1959, a joint Finnish-Soviet production entitled \"Sampo\", also known as \"The Day the Earth Froze\", was released, inspired by the story of the \"Sampo\" from the \"Kalevala\", which is also featured in a 1993 episode of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\".\nIn 1982, the Finnish Broadcasting Company (YLE) produced a television mini-series called , with music composed by Aulis Sallinen and book by Paavo Haavikko. The series was set \"during the Kalevala times\" and based upon events which take place in the \"Kalevala\". The series' part 3/4 won Prix Italia in 1983.\nThe martial arts film \"Jadesoturi\", also known as \"Jade Warrior\", released in Finland on 13 October 2006, was based upon the \"Kalevala\" and set in Finland and China. Also, the 2013 film \"\", directed by Jari Halonen, takes place both in the ancient land of the Kalevala and also in modern Finland. The film, made with a budget of \u20ac250,000, turned out to be a box-office bomb and received a mostly negative reception from critics.\nIn \"Chapter 17: The Apostate\", the first episode of the third season of \"The Mandalorian\" series, Din Djarin meets with Bo-Katan in an old Mandalorian castle, which is located in the Mandalore system planet called Kalevala. The same planet has also previously been mentioned in \"\" series.\nIn August 2024, it was announced that Antti Jokinen has been attached to direct the upcoming film \"\", and Elias Salonen has been cast as the title character in the film. The film will be premiered at the beginning of 2026.\nMilitary.\nHeinrich Himmler had designated the 41th Waffen SS Division as Grenadier Division Kalevala.\nInterpretations.\nThe \"Kalevala\" has attracted many scholars and enthusiasts to interpret its contents in a historical context. Many interpretations of the themes have been tabled. Some parts of the epic have been perceived as ancient conflicts between the early Finns and the Sami. In this context, the country of \"Kalevala\" could be understood as Southern Finland and \"Pohjola\" as Lapland.\nHowever, the place names in \"Kalevala\" seem to transfer the \"Kalevala\" further south, which has been interpreted as reflecting the Finnic expansion from the South that came to push the Sami further to the north. Some scholars locate the lands of \"Kalevala\" in East Karelia, where most of the \"Kalevala\" stories were written down. In 1963, the small town of \"Uhtua\" in the then Soviet Republic of Karelia was renamed Kalevala, perhaps to promote that theory.\nFinnish politician and linguist Eemil Nestor Set\u00e4l\u00e4 rejected the idea that the heroes of \"Kalevala\" are historical in nature and suggested they are personifications of natural phenomena. He interprets Pohjola as the northern heavens and the Sampo as the pillar of the world. Set\u00e4l\u00e4 suggests that the journey to regain the Sampo is a purely imaginary one with the heroes riding a mythological boat or magical steed to the heavens.\nThe practice of bear worship was once very common in Finland and there are strong echoes of this in the \"Kalevala\".\nThe old Finnish word (a strait of deep water with a slow current) appears to be the origin of the name V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen; one of V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen's other names is Suvantolainen, being the modern word for . Consequently, it is possible that the might be the island of Saaremaa in Estonia and \"Kalevala\" the Estonian mainland.\nFinnish folklorists Matti Kuusi and Pertti Anttonen state that terms such as \"the people of Kalevala\" or \"the tribe of Kalevala\" were fabricated by Elias L\u00f6nnrot. Moreover, they contend that the word \"Kalevala\" is very rare in traditional poetry and that by emphasizing dualism (Kalevala vs. Pohjola) Elias L\u00f6nnrot created the required tension that made the \"Kalevala\" dramatically successful and thus fit for a national epic of the time.\nThere are similarities with mythology and folklore from other cultures, for example, the Kullervo character and his story bearing some likeness to the Greek Oedipus. The similarity of the virginal maiden Marjatta to the Christian Virgin Mary is striking. The arrival of Marjatta's son in the final song spelling the end of V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen's reign over Kalevala is similar to the arrival of Christianity bringing about the end of Paganism in Finland and Europe at large.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nTranslations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRetellings.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAnalysis.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEncyclopedia.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded in 1865 during Reconstruction in the devastated South. Various historians have characterized the Klan as America's first terrorist group. The group is typically structured as a secret society containing several different organizations, that have historically resorted to terrorism, violence and acts of intimidation to impose their criteria and oppress their victims, most notably African Americans, Jews, and Catholics. A leader of one of these organizations is called a grand wizard, and there have been three distinct iterations with various other targets relative to time and place.\nThe first Klan was established in the Reconstruction era for men opposed to Reconstruction and founded by Confederate veterans that assaulted and murdered politically active Black people and their white political allies in the South. Federal law enforcement began taking action against it around 1871 and effectively shut it down. The Klan sought to overthrow Republican state governments in the South, especially by using voter intimidation and targeted violence against African-American leaders. The Klan was organized into numerous independent chapters across the Southern United States. Each chapter was autonomous and highly secretive about membership and plans. Members made their own, often colorful, costumes: robes, masks and pointed hats, designed to be terrifying and to hide their identities.\nThe second iteration of the Klan originated in the late 1910s, and was the first to use cross burnings and standardized white-hooded robes. The KKK of the 1920s had a nationwide membership in the millions and reflected a cross-section of the native born white Protestant population. The third and current Klan formed in the mid 20th century, was largely a reaction to the growing civil rights movement. It used murder and bombings to achieve its aims. All three iterations have called for the \"purification\" of American society. In each era, membership was secret and estimates of the total were highly exaggerated by both allies and enemies.\nEach iteration of the Klan is defined by non-overlapping time periods, comprising local chapters with little or no central direction. Each has advocated reactionary positions such as white nationalism, anti-immigration and\u2014especially in later iterations\u2014Nordicism, antisemitism, anti-Catholicism, right-wing populism, anti-communism, homophobia, anti-atheism, anti-globalization, and Islamophobia.\nOverview.\nFirst Klan.\nThe first Klan was founded in Pulaski, Tennessee, on December 24, 1865, by six former officers of the Confederate Army: Frank McCord, Richard Reed, John Lester, John Kennedy, J. Calvin Jones, and James Crowe. It started as a fraternal social club inspired at least in part by the then largely defunct Sons of Malta. It borrowed parts of the initiation ceremony from that group, with the same purpose: \"ludicrous initiations, the baffling of public curiosity, and the amusement for members were the only objects of the Klan\", according to Albert Stevens in 1907. The manual of rituals was printed by Laps D. McCord of Pulaski. The origins of the hood are uncertain; it may have been appropriated from the Spanish capirote hood, or it may be traced to the \"folk traditions of carnival, circus, minstrelsy, Mardi Gras - or mid-century 'Calico Indians'\" of the upstate New York Anti-Rent War.\nAccording to \"The Cyclop\u00e6dia of Fraternities\" (1907), \"Beginning in April, 1867, there was a gradual transformation.\u00a0... The members had conjured up a veritable Frankenstein. They had played with an engine of power and mystery, though organized on entirely innocent lines, and found themselves overcome by a belief that something must lie behind it all\u2014that there was, after all, a serious purpose, a work for the Klan to do.\"\nThe KKK had no organizational structure above the chapter level. However, there were similar groups across the South that adopted similar goals. Klan chapters promoted white supremacy and spread throughout the South as an insurgent movement in resistance to Reconstruction. Confederate veteran John W. Morton founded a KKK chapter in Nashville, Tennessee. As a secret vigilante group, the Klan targeted freedmen and their allies; it sought to restore white supremacy by threats and violence, including murder. \"They targeted white Northern leaders, Southern sympathizers and politically active Blacks.\" In 1870 and 1871, the federal government passed the Enforcement Acts, which were intended to prosecute and suppress Klan crimes.\nThe first Klan had mixed results in terms of achieving its objectives. It seriously weakened the Black political leadership through its use of assassinations and threats of violence, and it drove some people out of politics. On the other hand, it caused a sharp backlash, with passage of federal laws that historian Eric Foner says were a success in terms of \"restoring order, reinvigorating the morale of Southern Republicans, and enabling Blacks to exercise their rights as citizens\". Historian George C. Rable argues that the Klan was a political failure and therefore was discarded by the Democratic Party leaders of the South. He says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Klan declined in strength in part because of internal weaknesses; its lack of central organization and the failure of its leaders to control criminal elements and sadists. More fundamentally, it declined because it failed to achieve its central objective \u2013 the overthrow of Republican state governments in the South.\nAfter the Klan was suppressed, similar insurgent paramilitary groups arose that were explicitly directed at suppressing Republican voting and turning Republicans out of office: the White League, which started in Louisiana in 1874; and the Red Shirts, which started in Mississippi and developed chapters in the Carolinas. For instance, the Red Shirts are credited with helping elect Wade Hampton as governor in South Carolina. They were described as acting as the military arm of the Democratic Party and are attributed with helping white Democrats regain control of state legislatures throughout the South.\nSecond Klan.\nIn 1915, the second Klan was founded atop Stone Mountain, Georgia, by William Joseph Simmons. While Simmons relied on documents from the original Klan and memories of some surviving elders, the revived Klan was based significantly on the wildly popular film \"The Birth of a Nation\". The earlier Klan had not worn the white costumes and had not burned crosses; these aspects were introduced in Thomas Dixon's 1905 fictional novel \"\", on which the film was based. When the film was shown in Atlanta in December of that year, Simmons and his new Klansmen paraded to the theater in robes and pointed hoods\u2014many on robed horses\u2014just like in the film. These mass parades became another hallmark of the new Klan that had not existed in the First Klan.\nBeginning in 1921, the Second Klan adopted a modern business system of using full-time, paid recruiters and it appealed to new members as a fraternal organization, of which many examples were flourishing at the time. The national headquarters made its profit through a monopoly on costume sales, while the organizers kept the initiation fees. It grew rapidly nationwide at a time of prosperity. \nWriter W. J. Cash, in his 1941 book \"The Mind of the South\" characterized the second Klan as \"anti-Negro, anti-Alien, anti-Red, anti-Catholic, anti-Jew, anti-Darwin, anti-Modern, anti-Liberal, Fundamentalist, vastly Moral, [and] militantly Protestant. And summing up these fears, it brought them into focus with the tradition of the past, and above all with the ancient Southern pattern of high romantic histrionics, violence and mass coercion of the scapegoat and the heretic.\" It preached \"One Hundred Percent Americanism\" and demanded the purification of politics, calling for strict morality and better enforcement of Prohibition. Its official rhetoric focused on the threat of the Catholic Church, using anti-Catholicism and nativism. Its appeal was directed exclusively toward white Protestants; it opposed Jews, Black people, Catholics, and newly arriving Southern and Eastern European immigrants, most of whom were Jewish or Catholic.\nSome local groups threatened violence against rum runners and those they deemed \"notorious sinners\"; the relatively few violent episodes led by the Second KKK nearly all took place in the South. The Red Knights were a militant group organized in opposition to the Klan and it responded violently to Klan provocations on several occasions.\nThe Second Klan was a formal fraternal organization, with a national and state structure. During its heyday, its publicity was handled by the Southern Publicity Association. Within the first six months of the Association's national recruitment campaign, Klan membership had increased by 85,000. At its peak in the mid-1920s, the organization's membership was estimated as high as three to eight million members.\nIn 1923, Simmons was ousted as leader of the KKK by Hiram Wesley Evans. From September 1923 there were two Ku Klux Klan national organizations: the one founded by Simmons and led by Evans with its strength primarily in the southern United States, and a breakaway group led by Grand Dragon D. C. Stephenson based in Evansville, Indiana with its membership primarily in the midwest.\nInternal divisions, criminal behavior by leaders\u2014especially Stephenson's conviction for the abduction, rape, and murder of Madge Oberholtzer\u2014and external opposition brought about a collapse in the membership of both national Klan groups. The main group's membership had dropped to about 30,000 by 1930. It finally faded away in the 1940s.\nKlan organizers also operated in Canada, especially in Saskatchewan in 1926\u20131928, where Klansmen denounced immigrants from Eastern Europe as a threat to Canada's \"Anglo-Saxon\" heritage.\nThird Klan.\nThe \"Ku Klux Klan\" name was used by numerous independent local secret groups opposing the civil rights movement and desegregation, especially in the 1950s and 1960s. They sometimes forged informal alliances with Southern police departments, as in Birmingham, Alabama; or with governor's offices, as with George Wallace of Alabama. Several activists of the Third Klan were convicted of murder in the deaths of civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964 and of children in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham in 1963.\nThe United States government considers the Third Klan to be a \"subversive terrorist organization\". In April 1997, FBI agents arrested four members of the True Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Dallas for conspiracy to commit robbery and for conspiring to blow up a natural gas processing plant. In 1999, the city council of Charleston, South Carolina, passed a resolution declaring the Klan a terrorist organization.\nThe Third Klan groups have been in a state of consistent decline. A variety of factors are involved: the public's negative distaste of the group's image, platform, and history; infiltration and prosecution by law enforcement; civil lawsuit financial forfeitures; and the radical right-wing's perception of the Klan as outdated and unfashionable. The Southern Poverty Law Center reported that between 2016 and 2019, the number of Klan groups in America dropped from 130 to just 51. A 2016 report by the Anti-Defamation League claims an estimate of just over 30 Third Klan groups still active. Estimates of total collective membership range from about 3,000 to 8,000. In addition to its active membership, the Third Klan has an \"unknown number of associates and supporters\".\nHistory.\nEtymology.\nThe name was probably formed in 1865 by combining the Greek ' (\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, which means circle) with \"clan\". The word had previously been used for other fraternal organizations in the South such as Kuklos Adelphon.\nFirst Klan: 1865\u20131871.\nCreation and naming.\nSix Confederate veterans from Pulaski, Tennessee, created the First Ku Klux Klan on December 24, 1865, during the Reconstruction of the South. The group was known for a short time as the \"Kuklux Clan\". The Ku Klux Klan was one of a number of secret, oath-bound organizations using violence, which included the Southern Cross in New Orleans (1865) and the Knights of the White Camelia (1867) in Louisiana.\nHistorians see the First KKK as part of the post-Civil War violent efforts to reverse the dramatically changed social situation by using extrajudicial means to restore white supremacy. In 1866, Mississippi governor William L. Sharkey reported widespread disorder, lack of control, and lawlessness. In other Southern states, armed bands of Confederate soldiers roamed at will. The Klan systematically used violence against black people and their white allies as intimidation. They burned houses and attacked and killed black people, leaving their bodies on the roads.\nAt an 1867 meeting in Nashville, Tennessee, First Klan activists tried to create a hierarchical organization with local chapters eventually reporting to a national headquarters. Since most of the Klansmen were veterans, they were used to such military hierarchy. The effort did not succeed: the First Klan never operated under any centralized structure. Local chapters and bands were always highly independent.\nFormer Confederate brigadier general George Gordon developed the \"Prescript\", which espoused white supremacist belief. For instance, an applicant should be asked if he was in favor of \"a white man's government\", \"the reenfranchisement and emancipation of the white men of the South, and the restitution of the Southern people to all their rights\". The latter is a reference to the Ironclad Oath, which stripped the vote from white persons who refused to swear that they had not borne arms against the Union.\nConfederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest was elected the first grand wizard, and claimed to be the Klan's national leader. In an 1868 newspaper interview, Forrest stated that the Klan's primary opposition was to the Loyal Leagues, radical Republican state governments. They opposed people such as Tennessee governor William Gannaway Brownlow, and other \"carpetbaggers\" and \"scalawags\". Forrest argued that many Southerners believed that Black people were voting for the Republican Party because they were being hoodwinked by the Loyal Leagues. One Alabama newspaper editor declared \"The League is nothing more than a nigger Ku Klux Klan.\"\nDespite Gordon's and Forrest's work, local Klan units never accepted the \"Prescript\" and continued to operate autonomously. There were never hierarchical levels or state headquarters. Klan members used violence to settle old personal feuds and local grudges, as they worked to restore general white dominance in the disrupted postwar society. The historian Elaine Frantz Parsons describes the membership:\nLifting the Klan mask revealed a chaotic multitude of anti\u00adblack vigilante groups, dis\u00adgruntled poor white farmers, wartime guerrilla bands, displaced Democratic politicians, illegal whiskey distillers, coercive moral reformers, bored young men, sadists, rapists, white work\u00admen fearful of black competition, employers trying to enforce labor discipline, common thieves, neighbors with decades-old grudges, and even a few freed\u00admen and white Republicans who allied with Democratic whites or had criminal agendas of their own. Indeed, all they had in common, besides being over\u00adwhelmingly white, southern, and Democratic, was that they called them\u00adselves, or were called, Klansmen.\nHistorian Eric Foner observed: \"In effect, the Klan was a military force serving the interests of the Democratic party, the planter class, and all those who desired restoration of white supremacy. Its purposes were political, but political in the broadest sense, for it sought to affect power relations, both public and private, throughout Southern society. It aimed to reverse the interlocking changes sweeping over the South during Reconstruction: to destroy the Republican party's infrastructure, undermine the Reconstruction state, reestablish control of the Black labor force, and restore racial subordination in every aspect of Southern life.\" To that end they worked to curb the education, economic advancement, voting rights, and right to keep and bear arms of Black people.The First Klan soon spread into every Southern state, launching a reign of terror against Republican leaders both Black and white.\nActivities.\nIn a 1933 interview, William Sellers, born enslaved in Virginia, recalled the post-war \"raids of the Ku Klux, young white men of Rockingham County who would go into the huts of the recently freed negroes or catch some negro who had been working for thirty cents a day on his way home from work...and cruelly whip him, leaving him to live or die.\" Seemingly random whipping attacks, meant to be suggestive of previous condition of servitude, were a widespread aspect of the early Klan; for example in 1870\u201371 in Limestone Township (now Cherokee County), South Carolina, of 77 documented attacks, \"four were shot, sixty-seven whipped and six had had their ears cropped.\"\nKlan members adopted masks and robes that hid their identities and added to the drama of their night rides. The South was heavily rural and most people knew each other's faces, and sometimes could recognize the attackers by voice and mannerisms. \"The kind of thing that men are afraid or ashamed to do openly, and by day, they accomplish secretly, masked, and at night.\" The night riders of the First Klan \"sometimes claimed to be ghosts of Confederate soldiers so, as they claimed, to frighten superstitious Blacks. Few freedmen took such nonsense seriously.\"\nThe First Klan attacked Black members of the Loyal Leagues and intimidated white Republicans and Freedmen's Bureau workers. When they killed Black political leaders, they also took heads of families, along with the leaders of churches and community groups, because these people had many roles in society. Agents of the Freedmen's Bureau reported weekly assaults and murders of Black people.\n\"Armed guerrilla warfare killed thousands of Negroes; political riots were staged; their causes or occasions were always obscure, their results always certain: ten to one hundred times as many Negroes were killed as whites.\" Masked men shot into houses and burned them, sometimes with the occupants still inside. They drove successful Black farmers off their land. \"Generally, it can be reported that in North and South Carolina, in 18 months ending in June 1867, there were 197 murders and 548 cases of aggravated assault.\"\nKlan violence worked to suppress Black voting, and campaign seasons were deadly. More than 2,000 people were killed, wounded, or otherwise injured in Louisiana within a few weeks prior to the Presidential election of November 1868. Although St. Landry Parish had a registered Republican majority of 1,071, after the murders, no Republicans voted in the fall elections. White Democrats cast the full vote of the parish for President Grant's opponent. The KKK killed and wounded more than 200 Black Republicans, hunting and chasing them through the woods. Thirteen captives were taken from jail and shot; a half-buried pile of 25 bodies was found in the woods. The KKK made people vote Democratic and gave them certificates of the fact.\nIn the April 1868 Georgia gubernatorial election, Columbia County cast 1,222 votes for Republican Rufus Bullock. By the November presidential election, Klan intimidation led to suppression of the Republican vote and only one person voted for Ulysses S. Grant.\nKlansmen killed more than 150 African Americans in Jackson County, Florida, and hundreds more in other counties including Madison, Alachua, Columbia, and Hamilton. Florida Freedmen's Bureau records provided a detailed recounting of Klansmen's beatings and murders of freedmen and their white allies.\nMilder encounters, including some against white teachers, also occurred. In Mississippi, according to the Congressional inquiry:\nOne of these teachers (Miss Allen of Illinois), whose school was at Cotton Gin Port in Monroe County, was visited ... between one and two o'clock in the morning in March 1871, by about fifty men mounted and disguised. Each man wore a long white robe and his face was covered by a loose mask with scarlet stripes. She was ordered to get up and dress which she did at once and then admitted to her room the captain and lieutenant who in addition to the usual disguise had long horns on their heads and a sort of device in front. The lieutenant had a pistol in his hand and he and the captain sat down while eight or ten men stood inside the door and the porch was full. They treated her \"gentlemanly and quietly\" but complained of the heavy school-tax, said she must stop teaching and go away and warned her that they never gave a second notice. She heeded the warning and left the county.\nBy 1868, two years after the Klan's creation, its activity was beginning to decrease. Members were hiding behind Klan masks and robes as a way to avoid prosecution for freelance violence. Many influential Southern Democrats feared that Klan lawlessness provided an excuse for the federal government to retain its power over the South, and they began to turn against it. There were outlandish claims made, such as Georgian B. H. Hill stating \"that some of these outrages were actually perpetrated by the political friends of the parties slain.\"\nResistance.\nUnion Army veterans in mountainous Blount County, Alabama, organized \"the anti-Ku Klux\". They put an end to violence by threatening Klansmen with reprisals unless they stopped whipping Unionists and burning Black churches and schools. Armed Black people formed their own defense in Bennettsville, South Carolina, and patrolled the streets to protect their homes.\nNational sentiment gathered to crack down on the Klan, even though some Democrats at the national level questioned whether the Klan really existed, or believed that it was a creation of nervous Southern Republican governors. Many southern states began to pass anti-Klan legislation.\nIn January 1871, Pennsylvania Republican senator John Scott convened a congressional committee which took testimony from 52 witnesses about Klan atrocities, accumulating 12 volumes. In February, former Union general and congressman Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts introduced the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (Ku Klux Klan Act). This added to the enmity that Southern white Democrats bore toward him. While the bill was being considered, further violence in the South swung support for its passage. The governor of South Carolina appealed for federal troops to assist his efforts in keeping control of the state. A riot and massacre occurred in a Meridian, Mississippi, courthouse, from which a Black state representative escaped by fleeing to the woods. The 1871 Civil Rights Act allowed the president to suspend \"habeas corpus.\"\nIn 1871, President Ulysses S. Grant signed Butler's legislation. The Ku Klux Klan Act and the Enforcement Act of 1870 were used by the federal government to enforce the civil rights provisions for individuals under the constitution. The Klan refused to voluntarily dissolve after the 1871 Klan Act, so President Grant issued a suspension of \"habeas corpus\" and stationed federal troops in nine South Carolina counties by invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807. The Klansmen were apprehended and prosecuted in federal court. Judges Hugh Lennox Bond and George S. Bryan presided over South Carolina Ku Klux Klan Trials in Columbia, S.C., during December 1871. The defendants were given from three months to five years of incarceration with fines. More Black people served on juries in federal court than on local or state juries, so they had a chance to participate in the process. Hundreds of Klan members were fined or imprisoned during the crackdown, \"once the national government became set upon a policy of military intervention whole populations which had scouted the authority of the weak 'Radical' government of the State became meek.\"\nEnd of the first Klan.\nKlan leader Nathan Bedford Forrest boasted that the Klan was a nationwide organization of 550,000 men and that he could muster 40,000 Klansmen within five days' notice. However, the Klan had no membership rosters, no chapters, and no local officers, so it was difficult for observers to judge its membership. It had created a sensation by the dramatic nature of its masked forays and because of its many murders.\nIn 1870, a federal grand jury determined that the Klan was a \"terrorist organization\" and issued hundreds of indictments for crimes of violence and terrorism. Klan members were prosecuted, and many fled from areas that were under federal government jurisdiction, particularly in South Carolina. Many people not formally inducted into the Klan had used the Klan's costume to hide their identities when carrying out independent acts of violence. Forrest called for the Klan to disband in 1869, arguing that it was \"being perverted from its original honorable and patriotic purposes, becoming injurious instead of subservient to the public peace\". Historian Stanley Horn argues that \"generally speaking, the Klan's end was more in the form of spotty, slow, and gradual disintegration than a formal and decisive disbandment\". A Georgia-based reporter wrote in 1870: \"A true statement of the case is not that the Ku Klux are an organized band of licensed criminals, but that men who commit crimes call themselves Ku Klux\".\nIn many states, officials were reluctant to use Black militia against the Klan out of fear that racial tensions would be raised. Republican governor of North Carolina William Woods Holden called out the militia against the Klan in 1870, adding to his unpopularity. This and extensive violence and fraud at the polls caused the Republicans to lose their majority in the state legislature. Disaffection with Holden's actions contributed to white Democratic legislators impeaching him and removing him from office, but their reasons for doing so were numerous.\nKlan operations ended in South Carolina and gradually withered away throughout the rest of the South. Attorney General Amos Tappan Ackerman led the prosecutions.\nFoner argues that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;By 1872, the federal government's evident willingness to bring its legal and coercive authority to bear had broken the Klan's back and produced a dramatic decline in violence throughout the South. So ended the Reconstruction career of the Ku Klux Klan.\nNew groups of insurgents emerged in the mid-1870s, local paramilitary organizations such as the White League, Red Shirts, saber clubs, and rifle clubs, that intimidated and murdered Black political leaders. The White League and Red Shirts were distinguished by their willingness to cultivate publicity, working directly to overturn Republican officeholders and regain control of politics.\nIn 1882, the Supreme Court ruled in \"United States v. Harris\" that the Klan Act was partially unconstitutional. It ruled that Congress's power under the Fourteenth Amendment did not include the right to regulate against private conspiracies. It recommended that persons who had been victimized should seek relief in state courts, which were entirely unsympathetic to such appeals.\nKlan costumes, also called \"regalia\", disappeared from use by the early 1870s, after Grand Wizard Forrest called for their destruction as part of disbanding the Klan. The Klan was broken as an organization by 1872.\nSecond Klan: 1915\u20131944.\nRefounding in 1915.\nIn 1915, the film \"The Birth of a Nation\" was released, mythologizing and glorifying the first Klan and its endeavors. The second Ku Klux Klan was founded in 1915 by William Joseph Simmons at Stone Mountain, near Atlanta, with fifteen \"charter members\". Its growth was based on a new anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic, Prohibitionist and anti-Semitic agenda, which reflected contemporary social tensions, particularly recent immigration. The new organization and chapters adopted regalia featured in \"The Birth of a Nation\"; membership was kept secret by wearing masks in public.\n\"The Birth of a Nation\".\nDirector D.\u00a0W. Griffith's \"The Birth of a Nation\" glorified the original Klan. The film was based on the book and play \"\", as well as the book \"The Leopard's Spots\", both by Thomas Dixon Jr. Much of the modern Klan's iconography is derived from it, including the standardized white costume and the burning cross. Its imagery was based on Dixon's romanticized concept of old England and Scotland, as portrayed in the novels and poetry of Sir Walter Scott. The film's influence was enhanced by an alleged claim of endorsement by President Woodrow Wilson. Dixon was an old friend of Wilson's and, before its release, there was a private showing of the film at the White House. A publicist claimed that Wilson said, \"It is like writing history with lightning, and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true.\" The likelihood of him saying this is doubtful, and he wrote a letter condemning the film following protests.\nGoals.\nThe first and third Klans were primarily Southeastern groups aimed against Black people. The second Klan, in contrast, broadened the scope of the organization to appeal to people in the Midwestern and Western states who considered Catholics, Jews, and foreign-born minorities to be anti-American.\nThe Second Klan saw threats from every direction. According to historian Brian R. Farmer, \"two-thirds of the national Klan lecturers were Protestant ministers\". Much of the Klan's energy went into guarding the home, and historian Kathleen Blee says that its members wanted to protect \"the interests of white womanhood\". Joseph Simmons published the pamphlet \"ABC of the Invisible Empire\" in Atlanta in 1917; in it, he identified the Klan's goals as \"to shield the sanctity of the home and the chastity of womanhood; to maintain white supremacy; to teach and faithfully inculcate a high spiritual philosophy through an exalted ritualism; and by a practical devotedness to conserve, protect and maintain the distinctive institutions, rights, privileges, principles and ideals of a pure Americanism\". Such moral-sounding purpose underlay its appeal as a fraternal organization, recruiting members with a promise of aid for settling into the new urban societies of rapidly growing cities such as Dallas and Detroit. During the 1930s, particularly after James A. Colescott of Indiana took over as imperial wizard, opposition to Communism became another primary aim of the Klan.\nOrganization.\nNew Klan founder William J. Simmons joined 12 different fraternal organizations and recruited for the Klan with his chest covered with fraternal badges, consciously modeling the Klan after fraternal organizations. Klan organizers called \"Kleagles\" signed up hundreds of new members, who paid initiation fees and received KKK costumes in return. The organizer kept half the money and sent the rest to state or national officials. When the organizer was done with an area, he organized a rally, often with burning crosses, and perhaps presented a Bible to a local Protestant preacher. He left town with the money collected. The local units operated like many fraternal organizations and occasionally brought in speakers.\nSimmons initially met with little success in either recruiting members or in raising money, and the Klan remained a small operation in the Atlanta area until 1920. The group produced publications for national circulation from its headquarters in Atlanta: \"Searchlight\" (1919\u20131924), \"Imperial Night-Hawk\" (1923\u20131924), and \"The Kourier\".\nPerceived moral threats.\nThe second Klan was a response to fears regarding the growing power of Catholics and American Jews and the accompanying proliferation of non-Protestant cultural values. The Klan had a nationwide reach by the mid-1920s, with its densest per capita membership in Indiana. It became most prominent in cities with high growth rates between 1910 and 1930, as rural Protestants flocked to jobs in Detroit and Dayton in the Midwest, and Atlanta, Dallas, Memphis, and Houston in the South. Close to half of Michigan's 80,000 Klansmen lived in Detroit.\nMembers of the KKK swore to uphold American values and Protestant, and some Protestant ministers became involved at the local level. However, no major Protestant denomination officially endorsed the KKK; indeed, the Klan was repeatedly denounced by the major Protestant magazines, as well as by all major secular newspapers. It was supported by one small cult, the Pillar of Fire Church controlled by Bishop Alma Bridwell White, but she said she and her followers did not belong to the Klan.\nHistorian Robert Moats Miller reports that \"not a single endorsement of the Klan was found by the present writer in the Methodist press, while many of the attacks on the Klan were quite savage.\u00a0...The Southern Baptist press condoned the aims but condemned the methods of the Klan.\" National denominational organizations never endorsed the Klan, but they rarely condemned it by name. Many nationally and regionally prominent churchmen did condemn it by name, and none endorsed it.\nThe second Klan was less violent than either the first or third Klan were. However, the second Klan, especially in the Southeast, was not an entirely non-violent organization. The most violent Klan was in Dallas, Texas. In April 1921, several members of the Klan kidnapped Alex Johnson, a Black man who had been accused of having sex with a white woman. They burned the letters \"KKK\" into his forehead and gave him a severe beating by a riverbed. The police chief and district attorney refused to prosecute, explicitly and publicly stating they believed that Johnson deserved this treatment. Encouraged by the approval of this whipping, Klansmen in Dallas whipped 68 people by the riverbed in 1922 alone. Although Johnson had been Black, most of the Dallas KKK's whipping victims were white men who were accused of offenses against their wives such as adultery, wife beating, abandoning their wives, refusing to pay child support or gambling. Klansmen often invited local newspaper reporters to attend their whippings so they could write a story about it in the next day's newspaper. All the Dallas newspapers strongly condemned the Klan. Historians report that the \"Morning News\": \"diligently published thousands of anti-Klan editorials, expos\u00e9s, and critical stories, informing its readership of Klan activities in their community as well as from around the state and the nation.\"\nThe Alabama KKK whipped both white and Black women who were accused of fornication or adultery. Although many people in Alabama were outraged by the whippings of white women, no Klansmen were ever convicted for the violence. Anti-Catholicism was a main concern of the Alabama Klan, and Hugo Black built his political career in the 1920s on fighting Catholicism. Black, a Democrat, went on to the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Supreme Court.\nRapid growth.\nIn 1920, Simmons handed the day-to-day activities of the national office over to two professional publicists, Elizabeth Tyler and Edward Young Clarke. The new leadership invigorated the Klan and it grew rapidly. It appealed to new members based on current social tensions, and stressed responses to fears raised by defiance of Prohibition and new sexual freedoms. It emphasized anti-Jewish, anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant and later anti-Communist positions. It presented itself as a fraternal, nativist and strenuously patriotic organization; and its leaders emphasized support for vigorous enforcement of Prohibition laws. It expanded membership dramatically to a 1924 peak of 1.5\u00a0million to 4\u00a0million, which was between 4\u201315% of the eligible population.\nBy the 1920s, most of its members lived in the Midwest and West. Nearly one in five of the eligible Indiana population were members. It had a national base by 1925. In the South, where the great majority of whites were Democrats, the Klansmen were Democrats. In the rest of the country, the membership comprised both Republicans and Democrats, as well as independents. Klan leaders tried to infiltrate political parties; as Cummings notes, \"it was non-partisan in the sense that it pressed its nativist issues to both parties\". Sociologist Rory McVeigh has explained the Klan's strategy in appealing to members of both parties:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Klan leaders hope to have all major candidates competing to win the movement's endorsement. ... The Klan's leadership wanted to keep their options open and repeatedly announced that the movement was not aligned with any political party. This non-alliance strategy was also valuable as a recruiting tool. The Klan drew its members from Democratic as well as Republican voters. If the movement had aligned itself with a single political party, it would have substantially narrowed its pool of potential recruits.\nReligion was a major selling point. Kelly J. Baker argues that Klansmen seriously embraced Protestantism as an essential component of their white supremacist, anti-Catholic, and paternalistic formulation of American democracy and national culture. Their cross was a religious symbol, and their ritual honored Bibles and local ministers. But no nationally prominent religious leader said he was a Klan member.\nEconomists Fryer and Levitt argue that the rapid growth of the Klan in the 1920s was partly the result of an innovative, multi-level marketing campaign. They also argue that the Klan leadership focused more intently on monetizing the organization during this period than fulfilling the political goals of the organization. Local leaders profited from expanding their membership.\nProhibition.\nHistorians agree that the Klan's resurgence in the 1920s was aided by the national debate over Prohibition. The historian Prendergast says that the KKK's \"support for Prohibition represented the single most important bond between Klansmen throughout the nation\". The Klan opposed bootleggers, sometimes with violence. In 1922, two hundred Klan members set fire to saloons in Union County, Arkansas. Membership in the Klan and in other Prohibition groups overlapped, and they sometimes coordinated activities.\nUrbanization.\nA significant characteristic of the second Klan was that it was an organization based in urban areas, reflecting the major shifts of population to cities in the North, West, and the South. In Michigan, for instance, 40,000 members lived in Detroit, where they made up more than half of the state's membership. Most Klansmen were lower- to middle-class whites who feared the waves of newcomers to the industrial cities: immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, who were mostly Catholic or Jewish; and Black and white migrants from the South. As new populations poured into cities, rapidly changing neighborhoods created social tensions. Because of the rapid pace of population growth in industrializing cities such as Detroit and Chicago, the Klan grew rapidly in the Midwest. The Klan also grew in booming Southern cities such as Dallas and Houston.\nIn the medium-size industrial city of Worcester, Massachusetts, in the 1920s, the Klan ascended to power quickly but declined as a result of opposition from the Catholic Church. There was no violence and the local newspaper ridiculed Klansmen as \"night-shirt knights\". Half of the members were Swedish Americans, including some first-generation immigrants. The ethnic and religious conflicts among more recent immigrants contributed to the rise of the Klan in the city. Swedish Protestants were struggling against Irish Catholics, who had been entrenched longer, for political and ideological control of the city.\nIn some states, historians have obtained membership rosters of some local units and matched the names against city directory and local records to create statistical profiles of the membership. Big city newspapers were often hostile and ridiculed Klansmen as ignorant farmers. Detailed analysis from Indiana showed that the rural stereotype was false for that state:\nIndiana's Klansmen represented a wide cross section of society: they were not disproportionately urban or rural, nor were they significantly more or less likely than other members of society to be from the working class, middle class, or professional ranks. Klansmen were Protestants, of course, but they cannot be described exclusively or even predominantly as fundamentalists. In reality, their religious affiliations mirrored the whole of white Protestant society, including those who did not belong to any church.\nThe Klan attracted people but most of them did not remain in the organization for long. Membership in the Klan turned over rapidly as people found out that it was not the group which they had wanted. Millions joined and at its peak in the 1920s the organization claimed numbers that amounted to 15% of the nation's eligible population. The lessening of social tensions contributed to the Klan's decline.\nCostumes and the burning cross.\nThe distinctive white costume permitted large-scale public activities, especially parades and cross-burning ceremonies, while keeping the membership roles a secret. Sales of the costumes provided the main financing for the national organization, while initiation fees funded local and state organizers.\nThe second Klan embraced the burning Latin cross as a dramatic display of symbolism, with a tone of intimidation. No crosses had been used as a symbol by the first Klan, but it became a symbol of the Klan's quasi-Christian message. Its lighting during meetings was often accompanied by prayer, the singing of hymns, and other overtly religious symbolism. In his novel \"The Clansman\", Thomas Dixon Jr. borrows the idea that the first Klan had used fiery crosses from 'the call to arms' of the Scottish Clans, and film director D.\u00a0W. Griffith used this image in \"The Birth of a Nation\"; Simmons adopted the symbol wholesale from the movie, and the symbol and action have been associated with the Klan ever since.\nWomen.\nBy the 1920s, the KKK developed a women's auxiliary, with chapters in many areas. Its activities included participation in parades, cross lightings, lectures, rallies, and boycotts of local businesses owned by Catholics and Jews. The Women's Klan was active in promoting Prohibition, stressing liquor's negative impact on wives and children. Its efforts in public schools included distributing Bibles and petitioning for the dismissal of Catholic teachers. As a result of the Women's Klan's efforts, Texas would not hire Catholic teachers to work in its public schools. As sexual and financial scandals rocked the Klan leadership late in the 1920s, the organization's popularity among both men and women dropped off sharply.\nPolitical role.\nThe second Klan expanded with new chapters in cities in the Midwest and West, and reached both Republicans and Democrats, as well as men without a party affiliation. The goal of Prohibition in particular helped the Klan and some Republicans to make common cause in the North.\nThe Klan had numerous members in every part of the United States but was particularly strong in the South and Midwest. At its peak, claimed Klan membership exceeded four million and comprised 20% of the adult white male population in many broad geographic regions, and 40% in some areas. The Klan also moved north into Canada, especially Saskatchewan, where it opposed Catholics.\nIn Indiana, members were American-born, white Protestants and covered a wide range of incomes and social levels. The Indiana Klan was perhaps the most prominent Ku Klux Klan in the nation. It claimed more than 30% of white male Hoosiers as members. In 1924 it supported Republican Edward Jackson in his successful campaign for governor.\nCatholic and liberal Democrats\u2014who were strongest in northeastern cities\u2014decided to make the Klan an issue at the 1924 Democratic National Convention in New York City. Their delegates proposed a resolution indirectly attacking the Klan; it was defeated by one vote out of 1,100. The leading presidential candidates were William Gibbs McAdoo, a Protestant with a base in the South and West where the Klan was strong, and New York governor Al Smith, a Catholic with a base in the large cities. After weeks of stalemate and bitter argumentation, both candidates withdrew in favor of a compromise candidate.\nIn some states, such as Alabama and California, KKK chapters had worked for political reform. In 1924, Klan members were elected to the city council in Anaheim, California. The city had been controlled by an entrenched commercial-civic elite that was mostly German American. Given their tradition of moderate social drinking, the German Americans did not strongly support Prohibition laws \u2013 the mayor had been a saloon keeper. Led by the minister of the First Christian Church, the Klan represented a rising group of politically oriented non-ethnic Germans who denounced the elite as corrupt, undemocratic and self-serving. The historian Christopher Cocoltchos says the Klansmen tried to create a model, orderly community. The Klan had about 1,200 members in Orange County, California. The economic and occupational profile of the pro- and anti-Klan groups shows the two were similar and about equally prosperous. Klan members were Protestants, as were most of their opponents, but the latter also included many Catholic Germans. Individuals who joined the Klan had earlier demonstrated a much higher rate of voting and civic activism than did their opponents. Cocoltchos suggests that many of the individuals in Orange County joined the Klan out of that sense of civic activism. The Klan representatives easily won the local election in Anaheim in April 1924. They fired city employees who were known to be Catholic and replaced them with Klan appointees. The new city council tried to enforce Prohibition. After its victory, the Klan chapter held large rallies and initiation ceremonies over the summer. The opposition organized, bribed a Klansman for the secret membership list, and exposed the Klansmen running in the state primaries; they defeated most of the candidates. Klan opponents in 1925 took back local government and succeeded in a special election in recalling the Klansmen who had been elected in April 1924. The Klan in Anaheim quickly collapsed, its newspaper closed after losing a libel suit, and the minister who led the local Klavern moved to Kansas.\nIn the South, Klan members were still Democratic, as it was essentially a one-party region for whites. Klan chapters were closely allied with Democratic police, sheriffs, and other functionaries of local government. Due to disenfranchisement of most African Americans and many poor whites around the start of the 20th century, the only political activity for whites took place within the Democratic Party.\nIn Alabama, Klan members advocated better public schools, effective Prohibition enforcement, expanded road construction, and other political measures to benefit lower-class white people. By 1925, the Klan was a political force in the state, as leaders such as J. Thomas Heflin, David Bibb Graves, and Hugo Black tried to build political power against the Black Belt wealthy planters, who had long dominated the state. In 1926, with Klan support, Bibb Graves won the Alabama governor's office. He was a former Klan chapter head. He pushed for increased education funding, better public health, new highway construction, and pro-labor legislation. Because the Alabama state legislature refused to redistrict until 1972, and then under court order, the Klan was unable to break the planters' and rural areas' hold on legislative power.\nScholars and biographers have recently examined Hugo Black's Klan role. Ball finds regarding the KKK that Black \"sympathized with the group's economic, nativist, and anti-Catholic beliefs\". Newman says Black \"disliked the Catholic Church as an institution\" and gave over 100 anti-Catholic speeches to KKK meetings across Alabama in his 1926 election campaign. Black was elected US senator in 1926 as a Democrat. In 1937 President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Black to the Supreme Court without knowing how active in the Klan he had been in the 1920s. He was confirmed by his fellow senators before the full KKK connection was known; Justice Black said he left the Klan when he became a senator.\nAlthough the KKK has generally been seen as anti-labor, according to historian Thomas R. Pegram, \"local Klans supported striking white Protestant workers\" but opposed mixed-race labor unions, and working-class Klan \"sympathies complicated urban socialist politics in the Midwest\".\nResistance and decline.\nMany groups and leaders, including prominent Protestant ministers such as Reinhold Niebuhr in Detroit, spoke out against the Klan, gaining national attention. The Jewish Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith was formed in the early 20th century in response to attacks on Jewish Americans, including the lynching of Leo Frank in Atlanta, and to the Klan's campaign to prohibit private schools (which was chiefly aimed at Catholic parochial schools). Opposing groups worked to penetrate the Klan's secrecy. After one civic group in Indiana began to publish Klan membership lists, there was a rapid decline in the number of Klan members. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) launched public education campaigns in order to inform people about Klan activities and lobbied in Congress against Klan abuses. After its peak in 1925, Klan membership in most areas began to decline rapidly. Specific events contributed to the Klan's decline as well. In Indiana, the scandal surrounding the 1925 murder trial of Grand Dragon D. C. Stephenson destroyed the image of the KKK as upholders of law and order. By 1926 the Klan was \"crippled and discredited\". D. C. Stephenson was the grand dragon of Indiana and 22 northern states. In 1923 he had led the states under his control in order to break away from the national KKK organization. At his 1925 trial, he was convicted of second-degree murder for his part in the rape, and subsequent death, of Madge Oberholtzer. After Stephenson's conviction, the Klan declined dramatically in Indiana.\nThe historian Leonard Moore says that a failure in leadership caused the Klan's collapse:\nStephenson and the other salesmen and office seekers who maneuvered for control of Indiana's Invisible Empire lacked both the ability and the desire to use the political system to carry out the Klan's stated goals. They were uninterested in, or perhaps even unaware of, grass roots concerns within the movement. For them, the Klan had been nothing more than a means for gaining wealth and power. These marginal men had risen to the top of the hooded order because, until it became a political force, the Klan had never required strong, dedicated leadership. More established and experienced politicians who endorsed the Klan, or who pursued some of the interests of their Klan constituents, also accomplished little. Factionalism created one barrier, but many politicians had supported the Klan simply out of expedience. When charges of crime and corruption began to taint the movement, those concerned about their political futures had even less reason to work on the Klan's behalf.\nIn Alabama, KKK vigilantes launched a wave of physical terror in 1927. They targeted both Black and white people for violations of racial norms and for perceived moral lapses. This led to a strong backlash, beginning in the media. Grover C. Hall Sr., editor of the \"Montgomery Advertiser\" from 1926, wrote a series of editorials and articles that attacked the Klan. (Today the paper says it \"waged war on the resurgent [KKK]\".) Hall won a Pulitzer Prize for the crusade, the 1928 Editorial Writing Pulitzer, citing \"his editorials against gangsterism, floggings and racial and religious intolerance\". Other newspapers kept up a steady, loud attack on the Klan, referring to the organization as violent and \"un-American\". Sheriffs cracked down on activities. In the 1928 presidential election, the state voters overcame their initial opposition to the Catholic candidate Al Smith and voted the Democratic Party line as usual.\nAlthough in decline, a measure of the Klan's influence was still evident when it staged its march along Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., in 1928. By 1930, Klan membership in Alabama dropped to less than 6,000. Small independent units continued to be active in the industrial city of Birmingham.\nKKK units were active through the 1930s in parts of Georgia, with a group of \"night riders\" in Atlanta enforcing their moral views by flogging people who violated them, whites as well as Black people. In March 1940, they were implicated in the beating murders of a young white couple taken from their car on a lovers lane, and flogged a white barber to death for drinking, both in East Point, a suburb of Atlanta. More than 20 others were \"brutally flogged\". As the police began to investigate, they found the records of the KKK had disappeared from their East Point office. The cases were reported by the \"Chicago Tribune\" and the NAACP in its \"Crisis\" magazine, as well as local papers.\nNational changes.\nIn 1939, after experiencing several years of decline due to the Great Depression, the Imperial Wizard Hiram Wesley Evans sold the national organization to James A. Colescott, an Indiana veterinary physician, and Samuel Green, an Atlanta obstetrician. They could not revive the Klan's declining membership. In 1944, the Internal Revenue Service filed a lien for $685,000 in back taxes against the Klan, and Colescott dissolved the organization by decree on April 23 of that year. Local Klan groups closed down over the following years.\nAfter World War II, the folklorist and author Stetson Kennedy infiltrated the Klan; he provided internal data to media and law enforcement agencies. He also provided secret code words to the writers of the \"Superman\" radio program, resulting in episodes in which Superman took on a thinly disguised version of the KKK. Kennedy stripped away the Klan's mystique and trivialized its rituals and code words, which may have contributed to the decline in Klan recruiting and membership. In the 1950s Kennedy wrote a bestselling book about his experiences, which further damaged the Klan.\nHistoriography of the second Klan.\nThe historiography of the second Klan of the 1920s has changed over time. Early histories were based on mainstream sources of the time, but since the late 20th century, other histories have been written drawing from records and analysis of members of the chapters in social histories.\nAnti-modern interpretations.\nThe KKK was a secret organization; apart from a few top leaders, most members never identified as such and wore masks in public. Investigators in the 1920s used KKK publicity, court cases, expos\u00e9s by disgruntled Klansmen, newspaper reports, and speculation to write stories about what the Klan was doing. Almost all the major national newspapers and magazines were hostile to its activities. The historian Thomas R. Pegram says that published accounts exaggerated the official viewpoint of the Klan leadership and repeated the interpretations of hostile newspapers and the Klan's enemies. There was almost no evidence in that time regarding the behavior or beliefs of individual Klansmen. According to Pegram, the resulting popular and scholarly interpretation of the Klan from the 1920s into the mid-20th century emphasized its Southern roots and the violent vigilante-style actions of the Klan in its efforts to turn back the clock of modernity. Scholars compared it to fascism in Europe. Amann states that, \"Undeniably, the Klan had some traits in common with European fascism\u2014chauvinism, racism, a mystique of violence, an affirmation of a certain kind of archaic traditionalism\u2014yet their differences were fundamental. ...[The KKK] never envisioned a change of political or economic system.\"\nPegram says this original interpretation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...depicted the Klan movement as an irrational rebuke of modernity by undereducated, economically marginal bigots, religious zealots, and dupes willing to be manipulated by the Klan's cynical, mendacious leaders. It was, in this view, a movement of country parsons and small-town malcontents who were out of step with the dynamism of twentieth-century urban America.\nNew social history interpretations.\nThe \"social history\" revolution in historiography from the 1960s explored history from the bottom up. In terms of the Klan, it developed evidence based on the characteristics, beliefs, and behavior of the typical membership, and downplayed accounts by elite sources. Historians discovered membership lists and the minutes of local meetings from KKK chapters scattered around the country. They discovered that the original interpretation was largely mistaken about the membership and activities of the Klan; the membership was not anti-modern, rural or rustic and consisted of fairly well-educated middle-class joiners and community activists. Half the members lived in the fast-growing industrial cities of the period: Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Denver, and Portland, Oregon, were Klan strongholds during the 1920s.\nStudies find that in general, the KKK membership in these cities was from the stable, successful middle classes, with few members drawn from the elite or the working classes. Pegram, reviewing the studies, concludes, \"the popular Klan of the 1920s, while diverse, was more of a civic exponent of white Protestant social values than a repressive hate group.\"\nKelly J. Baker argues that religion was critical\u2014the KKK based its hatred on a particular brand of Protestantism that resonated with mainstream Americans: \"Members embraced Protestant Christianity and a crusade to save America from domestic as well as foreign threats.\" Member were primarily Baptists, Methodists, and members of the Disciples of Christ, while men of \"more elite or liberal\" Protestant denominations such as Unitarians, Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Lutherans, were less likely to join.\nIndiana.\nIn Indiana, traditional political historians focused on notorious leaders, especially D. C. Stephenson, the Grand Dragon of the Indiana Klan, whose conviction for the 1925 kidnap, rape, and murder of Madge Oberholtzer helped destroy the Ku Klux Klan movement nationwide. In his history of 1967, Kenneth T. Jackson described the Klan of the 1920s as associated with cities and urbanization, with chapters often acting as a kind of fraternal organization to aid people coming from other areas.\nSocial historian Leonard Moore titled his monograph \"Citizen Klansmen\" (1997) and contrasted the intolerant rhetoric of the group's leaders with the actions of most of the membership. The Klan was white Protestant, established Americans who were fearful of change represented by new immigrants and Black migrants to the North. They were highly suspicious of Catholics, Jews and Black people, who they believed subverted ideal, Protestant moral standards. Violence was uncommon in most chapters. In Indiana, KKK members directed more threats and economic blacklisting primarily against fellow white Protestants for transgressions of community moral standards, such as adultery, wife-beating, gambling and heavy drinking. Up to one third of Indiana's Protestant men joined the order making it, Moore argued, \"a kind of interest group for average white Protestants who believed that their values should be dominant in their community and state.\"\nNorthern Indiana's industrial cities had attracted a large Catholic population of European immigrants and their descendants. They established the University of Notre Dame, a major Catholic college near South Bend. In May 1924, when the KKK scheduled a regional meeting in the city, Notre Dame students blocked the Klansmen and stole some KKK regalia. On the next day, the Klansmen counterattacked. Finally, the college president and the football coach Knute Rockne kept the students on campus to avert further violence.\nAlabama.\nIn Alabama, some young, white, urban activists joined the KKK to fight the old guard establishment. Hugo Black was a member and won a seat in the U.S. Senate by campaigning in KKK chapters where he focused on anti-Catholicism. However, in rural Alabama the Klan continued to operate to enforce Jim Crow laws; its members resorted more often to violence against Black people for infringements of the social order of white supremacy.\nRacial terrorism was used in smaller towns to suppress Black political activity. Elbert Williams of Brownsville, Tennessee, was lynched in 1940 for trying to organize Black residents to register and vote; also that year, Jesse Thornton of Luverne, Alabama, was lynched for failing to address a police officer as \"Mister\".\nLater \"Third\" Klans: 1940s\u2013present.\nIn 1944, the second KKK was disbanded by Imperial Wizard James A. Colescott after the IRS levied a large tax liability against the organization. In 1946, Samuel Green reestablished the KKK at a ceremony on Stone Mountain. His group primarily operated in Georgia. Green was succeeded by Samuel Roper as Imperial Wizard in 1949, and Roper was succeeded by Eldon Edwards in 1950. Based in Atlanta, Edwards worked to rebuild the organization by uniting the different factions of the KKK from other parts of the United States, but the strength of the organization was short-lived, and the group fractured as it competed with other klan organizations. In 1959, Roy Davis was elected to follow Edwards as national leader. Edwards had previously appointed Davis Grand Dragon of Texas in an effort to unite their two klan organizations. Davis was already leading the Original Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Davis held rallies Florida and other southern states during 1961 and 1962 recruiting members. Davis had been a close associate of William J. Simmons and been active in the KKK since it first reformed in 1915.\nCongress launched an investigation into the KKK in early 1964, following the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas. Davis, based in Dallas, resigned as Imperial Wizard of the Original Knights shortly after the Original Knights received a Congressional subpoena. The Original Knights became increasingly fractured in the immediate aftermath as many members were forced to testify before Congress. The White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan formed in 1964 after splitting from the Original Knights. According to an FBI report published in May 1965, the KKK was divided into 14 different organizations at the time with a total membership of approximately 9,000. The FBI reported that Roy Davis's Original Knights was the largest faction and had about 1,500 members. Robert Shelton of Alabama was leading a faction of 400\u2013600 members. Congressional investigators found that by the end of 1965 most members of Original Knights organization joined Shelton's United Klans and the Original Knights of the KKK disbanded. Shelton's United Klan continued to absorb members from the competing factions and remained the largest Klan group unto the 1970s, peaking with an estimated 30,000 members and another 250,000 non-member supporters during the late 1960s.\n1950s\u20131960s: post-war opposition to civil rights.\nAfter the decline of the national organization, small independent groups adopted the name \"Ku Klux Klan\", along with variations. They had no formal relationships with each other, and most had no connection to the second KKK, except for the fact that they copied its terminology and costumes. Beginning in the 1950s, for instance, individual Klan groups in Birmingham, Alabama, began to resist social change and Black people's efforts to improve their lives by bombing houses in transitional neighborhoods. The white men worked in mining and steel industries, with access to these materials. There were so many bombings of Black people's homes in Birmingham by Klan groups in the 1950s that the city was nicknamed \"Bombingham\".\nDuring the tenure of Bull Connor as police commissioner in Birmingham, Klan groups were closely allied with the police and operated with impunity. When the Freedom Riders arrived in Birmingham in 1961, Connor gave Klan members fifteen minutes to attack the riders before sending in the police to quell the attack. When local and state authorities failed to protect the Freedom Riders and activists, the federal government began to establish intervention and protection. In states such as Alabama and Mississippi, Klan members forged alliances with governors' administrations. In Birmingham and elsewhere, the KKK groups bombed the houses of civil rights activists. In some cases they used physical violence, intimidation, and assassination directly against individuals. Continuing disfranchisement of Black people across the South meant that most could not serve on juries, which were all-white and demonstrably biased verdicts and sentences.\nAccording to a report from the Southern Regional Council in Atlanta, the homes of 40 Black Southern families were bombed during 1951 and 1952. Some of the bombing victims were social activists whose work exposed them to danger, but most were either people who refused to bow to racist convention or were innocent bystanders, unsuspecting victims of random violence.\nAmong the more notorious murders by Klan members in the 1950s and 1960s were:\nResistance.\nThere was considerable resistance among African Americans and white allies to the Klan. In 1953, newspaper publishers W. Horace Carter (Tabor City, North Carolina), who had campaigned for three years, and Willard Cole (Whiteville, North Carolina) shared the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service citing \"their successful campaign against the Ku Klux Klan, waged on their own doorstep at the risk of economic loss and personal danger, culminating in the conviction of over one hundred Klansmen and an end to terrorism in their communities\". In a 1958 incident in North Carolina, the Klan burned crosses at the homes of two Lumbee Native Americans for associating with white people, and threatened more actions. When the KKK held a nighttime rally nearby, they were quickly surrounded by hundreds of armed Lumbee. Gunfire was exchanged, and the Klan was routed at what became known as the Battle of Hayes Pond.\nWhile the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had paid informants in the Klan (for instance, in Birmingham in the early 1960s), its relations with local law enforcement agencies and the Klan were often ambiguous. The head of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, appeared more concerned about Communist links to civil rights activists than about controlling Klan excesses against citizens. In 1964, the FBI's COINTELPRO program began attempts to infiltrate and disrupt civil rights groups.\nAs 20th-century Supreme Court rulings extended federal enforcement of citizens' civil rights, the government revived the Enforcement Acts and the Klan Act from Reconstruction days. Federal prosecutors used these laws as the basis for investigations and indictments in the 1964 murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner; and the 1965 murder of Viola Liuzzo. They were also the basis for prosecution in 1991 in \"Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic\".\nIn 1965, the House Un-American Activities Committee started an investigation on the Klan, putting in the public spotlight its front organizations, finances, methods and divisions.\n1970s\u2013present.\nAfter federal legislation was passed prohibiting legal segregation and authorizing enforcement of protection of voting rights, KKK groups began to oppose court-ordered busing to desegregate schools, affirmative action, and the more open immigration authorized in the 1960s. In 1971, KKK members used bombs to destroy 10 school buses in Pontiac, Michigan. By 1975, there were known KKK groups on most college campuses in Louisiana as well as at Vanderbilt University, the University of Georgia, the University of Mississippi, the University of Akron, and the University of Southern California. The KKK was involved in intimidating Vietnamese refugees in the Galveston Bay Area.\nMassacre of Communist Workers' Party protesters.\nOn November 3, 1979, five communist protesters were killed by KKK and American Nazi Party members in Greensboro, North Carolina, in what is known as the Greensboro massacre. The Communist Workers' Party had sponsored a rally against the Klan in an effort to organize predominantly Black industrial workers in the area. Klan members drove up with arms in their car trunks, and attacked marchers.\nKlan infiltrations.\nJerry Thompson, a newspaper reporter who infiltrated the KKK in 1979, reported that the FBI's COINTELPRO efforts were highly successful. Rival KKK factions accused each other's leaders of being FBI informants. William Wilkinson of the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, was revealed to have been working for the FBI.\nThompson also related that KKK leaders showed great concern about a series of civil lawsuits filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center, claiming damages amounting to millions of dollars. These were filed after KKK members shot into a group of African Americans. Klansmen curtailed their activities in order to conserve money for defense against the lawsuits. The KKK also used lawsuits as tools; they filed a libel suit in order to prevent the publication of a paperback edition of Thompson's book but were unsuccessful.\nA Jewish Defense League member known by the pseudonym \"Annette\" infiltrated neo-Nazi and Klan groups in 1979 and informed on two dozen Klansmen and neo-Nazis to JDL leader Edward Rainov. Edwin L. Reynolds, the Grand Dragon of the White Knights, a New Jersey Ku Klux Klan group, and two others were arrested \"on charges of rape, aggravated assault and threatening to kill the woman\". According to Annette the men lured her to a hotel room, handcuffed her and sexually assaulted her, breaking her wrists.\nChattanooga shooting.\nIn 1980, three KKK members shot four elderly Black women (Viola Ellison, Lela Evans, Opal Jackson, and Katherine Johnson) in Chattanooga, Tennessee, following a KKK initiation rally. A fifth woman, Fannie Crumsey, was injured by flying glass in the incident. Attempted murder charges were filed against the three KKK members, two of whom\u2014Bill Church and Larry Payne\u2014were acquitted by an all-white jury. The third defendant, Marshall Thrash, was sentenced by the same jury to nine months on lesser charges. He was released after three months. In 1982, a jury awarded the five women $535,000 in a civil trial.\nMichael Donald lynching.\nAfter Michael Donald was lynched in 1981 in Alabama, the FBI investigated his death. The US attorney prosecuted the case. Two local KKK members were convicted for his murder, including Henry Francis Hays who was sentenced to death. After exhausting the appeals process, Hays was executed by electric chair for Donald's death in Alabama on June 6, 1997. It was the first time since 1913 that a white person had been executed in Alabama for a crime against a black person.\nWith the support of attorneys Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and state senator Michael A. Figures, Donald's mother Beulah Mae Donald sued the KKK in civil court in Alabama. Her lawsuit against the United Klans of America was tried in February 1987. The all-white jury found the Klan responsible for the lynching of Donald, and ordered the Klan to pay US$7\u00a0million, but the KKK did not have sufficient funds to pay the fine. They had to sell off their national headquarters building in Tuscaloosa.\nNeo-Nazi alliances and Stormfront.\nIn 1995, Don Black and Chlo\u00ea Hardin, the ex-wife of the KKK grand wizard David Duke, began a small bulletin board system (BBS) called Stormfront, which has become a prominent online forum for white nationalism, Neo-Nazism, hate speech, racism, and antisemitism in the early 21st century.\nIn a 2007 article by the ADL, it was reported that many KKK groups had formed strong alliances with other white supremacist groups, such as neo-Nazis. Some KKK groups have become increasingly \"nazified\", adopting the look and emblems of white power skinheads.\nCurrent developments.\nThe modern KKK is not one organization; rather, it is composed of small independent chapters across the United States. According to a 1999 ADL report, the KKK's estimated size then was \"no more than a few thousand, organized into slightly more than 100 units\". In 2017, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which monitors extremist groups, estimated that there were \"at least 29 separate, rival Klan groups currently active in the United States, and they compete with one another for members, dues, news media attention and the title of being the true heir to the Ku Klux Klan\". The formation of independent chapters has made KKK groups more difficult to infiltrate, and researchers find it hard to estimate their numbers. Analysts believe that about two-thirds of KKK members are concentrated in the Southern United States, with another third situated primarily in the lower Midwest.\nFor some time, the Klan's numbers have been steadily dropping. This decline has been attributed to the Klan's lack of competence in the use of the Internet, their history of violence, a proliferation of competing hate groups, and a decline in the number of young racist activists who are willing to join groups at all.\nIn 2015, the number of KKK chapters nationwide grew from 72 to 190. The SPLC released a similar report stating that \"there were significant increases in Klan as well as Black separatist groups\".\nA 2016 analysis by the SPLC found that hate groups in general were on the rise in the United States. The ADL published a report in 2016 that concluded: \"Despite a persistent ability to attract media attention, organized Ku Klux Klan groups are actually continuing a long-term trend of decline. They remain a collection of mostly small, disjointed groups that continually change in name and leadership.\"\nRecent KKK membership campaigns have exploited people's anxieties about illegal immigration, urban crime, and same-sex marriage. In 2006, J. Keith Akins argued that \"Klan literature and propaganda is rabidly homophobic and encourages violence against gays and lesbians.\u00a0...Since the late 1970s, the Klan has increasingly focused its ire on this previously ignored population.\" Since the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Klan has produced Islamophobic propaganda and distributed anti-Islamic flyers.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has provided legal support to various factions of the KKK in defense of their First Amendment rights to hold public rallies, parades, and marches, as well as their right to field political candidates.\nThe February 14, 2019, edition of the Linden, Alabama, weekly newspaper \"The Democrat-Reporter\" carried an editorial titled \"Klan needs to ride again\" written by Goodloe Sutton\u2014the newspaper's owner, publisher and editor\u2014which urged the Klan to return to staging their night rides, because proposals were being made to raise taxes in the state. In an interview, Sutton suggested that Washington, D.C., could be \"clean[ed] out\" by way of lynchings. \"We'll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them,\" Sutton said. He also specified that he was only referring to hanging \"socialist-communists\" and compared the Klan to the NAACP. The editorial and Sutton's subsequent comments provoked calls for his resignation from Alabama politicians and the Alabama Press Association, which later censured Sutton and suspended the newspaper's membership. In addition, the University of Southern Mississippi's School of Communication removed Sutton\u2014who is an alumnus of that school\u2014from its Mass Communication and Journalism Hall of Fame, and \"strongly condemns\" his remarks. Sutton was also stripped of a distinguished community journalism award he had been presented in 2009 by Auburn University's Journalism Advisory Council. Sutton expressed no regret and said that the editorial was intended to be \"ironic\", but that \"not many people understand irony today.\"\nCurrent Klan organizations.\nA list is maintained by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL):\nOutside the United States and Canada.\nRegarded by historians as America's first terrorist group, there have been various attempts to organize KKK chapters outside America in places such as: Asia, Europe and Oceania, with negligible results.\nAfrica.\nIn apartheid South Africa in the 1960s, some far-right activists copied KKK actions, for example by writing \"Ku Klux Klan Africa\" on the ANC Cape Town offices or by wearing their costumes. In response, American Klan leader Terry Venable attempted to establish a branch at Rhodes University.\nIn the 1970s, Rhodesia had a Ku Klux Klan, led by Len Idensohn, attacking Ian Smith for his perceived moderation.\nAmericas.\nIn Mexico, on 1924 vigilantes claimed to have organized themselves into a Klan against \"criminals\", publishing a program of \"social epuration\".\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, the website of a group called Imperial Klans of Brazil was shut down in 2003, and the group's leader was arrested.\nThe Klan has also been established in the Canal Zone.\nThe Klan was present in Cuba, under the name of Ku Klux Klan Kubano, directed against both West Indian migrant workers and Afro-Cuban and using the fear of the 1912 Negro Rebellion.\nAsia.\nDuring the Vietnam War, klaverns were established on some US military bases, often tolerated by military authorities.\nIn the 1920s, the Klan briefly existed in Shanghai.\nEurope.\nRecruitment activity has also been reported in the United Kingdom. In the 1960s, \"klaverns\" were established in the Midlands, the following decade saw visits by leading Klansmen, and the 1990s saw recruitment drives in London, Scotland and the Midlands and huge internal turmoil and splintering: for example a leader, Allan Beshella, had to resign after a 1972 conviction for child sex abuse was revealed. In 2018, Klan-clad far-right activists marched in front of a Northern Irish mosque.\nIn Germany, a KKK-related group, \"Ritter des Feurigen Kreuzes\" (\"Knights of the Fiery Cross\"), was established in 1925 by returning naturalized German-born US citizens in Berlin who managed to gather around 300 persons of middle-class occupations such as merchants and clerks. It soon saw the original founders being removed by internal conflicts, and mocking newspapers about the affair. After the Nazis took over Germany, the group disbanded and its members joined the Nazis. In 1991, Dennis Mahon, then of Oklahoma's White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, reportedly helped to organize Klan groups. Another German KKK-related group, the European White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, has organized and it gained notoriety in 2012 when the German media reported that two police officers who held membership in the organization would be allowed to keep their jobs. In 2019, the German authorities conducted raids against a possibly dangerous group called National Socialist Knights of the Ku Klux Klan Deutschland.\nIn 2001, David Duke came to Moscow to network with local anti-Semitic Russian nationalists. Duke said that Russia was \"the key to white survival\" and blamed most of the events of the 20th century Russian history on the Jews.\nIn the 1920s, the Klan was rumoured to exist in Lithuania and Czechoslovakia.\nSome dozens of people rioted in Hennala, Finland in September 2015 and threw rocks and fireworks at refugees and the Red Cross staff working in the Hennala refugee center. The riot attracted national attention due to Ku Klux Klan imagery used in the riot. Then Finance Minister Alexander Stubb condemned the riot, saying people clad in Ku Klux Klan robes with a Finnish flag is a \"travesty\".\nOceania.\nIn Australia in the late 1990s, former One Nation member Peter Coleman established branches throughout the country, and circa 2012 the KKK has attempted to infiltrate other political parties such as Australia First. Branches of the Klan have previously existed in New South Wales and Victoria, as well as allegedly in Queensland. Unlike in the United States, the Australian branches did not require members to be Christian, but did require them to be white.\nOn 16 February 1872, white settlers in the Kingdom of Fiji formed a chapter of the KKK. Established as part of settler efforts to resist the Fijian government, the chapter's members swore an oath to carry arms and not pay taxes. Its headquarters, a former hotel in Levuka, was fortified with several artillery pieces. On 24 February, the Fijian KKK hosted its first general meeting which published resolutions that asserted \"the existing mode of government was contrary to the welfare of the community\". The chapter's existence increased the level of chaos in Levuka and in one instance a white settler charged with the murder of a Fijian was released from prison by 70 KKK members. In March of that year, the chapter was renamed as the \"British Subjects' Mutual Protection Society\" (BSMPS), which advocated for Fiji's annexation by Britain. Fiji became a British colony in 1874, and Governor Sir Hercules Robinson fully suppressed the BSMPS by 1875.\nIn the 1920s, the Klan had been rumoured to exist in New Zealand.\nTitles and vocabulary.\nMembership in the Klan is secret. Like many fraternal organizations, the Klan uses signs and coded language that members can use to recognize one another. In conversation, a member may use the acronym \"AYAK\" (Are you a Klansman?) to surreptitiously identify themselves to another potential member. The response \"AKIA\" (A Klansman, I am.) completes the greeting.\nThroughout its varied history, the Klan has coined many words beginning with \"Kl\", including:\nAll of the above terminology was created by William Joseph Simmons, as part of his 1915 revival of the Klan. The Reconstruction-era Klan used different titles; the only titles to carry over were \"Wizard\" for the overall leader of the Klan and \"Night Hawk\" for the official in charge of security.\nThe Imperial Kludd was the chaplain of the Imperial Klonvocation and he performed \"such other duties as may be required by the Imperial Wizard\".\nThe Imperial Kaliff was the second-highest position, after the imperial wizard.\nSymbols.\nThe Ku Klux Klan has utilized a variety of symbols over its history.\nBlood Drop Cross.\nThe most identifiable symbol used by the Klan for the past century has been the \"Mystic Insignia of a Klansman\", commonly known as the \"Blood Drop Cross\", a white cross on a red disk with what appears to be a blood drop in the middle. It was first used in the early 1900s, with the symbol in the center originally appearing as a red and white \"taijitu\" which in the subsequent years, lost the white lobe and was reinterpreted as a \"blood drop\".\nTriangular Klan symbol.\nThe Triangular Ku Klux Klan symbol is made of what looks like a triangle inside a triangle, similar to a Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, but in fact represents three letter Ks interlocked and facing inward, referencing the name of the group. A variation on this symbol has the K's facing outwards instead of inwards. It is an old Klan symbol that has also been resurrected as a modern-day hate symbol.\nBurning cross.\nAlthough predating the Klan, in modern times the symbol of the burning cross has become almost solely associated with the Ku Klux Klan and has become one of the most potent hate symbols in the United States. Burning crosses did not become associated with the Klan until Thomas Dixon's \"The Clansman\", and its film adaptation, D.\u00a0W. Griffith's \"The Birth of a Nation\" inspired members of the second Klan to take up the practice. In the modern day, the symbol of the burning cross is so associated with racial intimidation that it is used by many non-Klan racist elements and has spread to locations outside the United States.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nOfficial websites.\nBecause there are multiple Ku Klux Klan organizations, there are multiple official websites.

Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack\nKing Kong is a 1933 American pre-Code adventure horror monster film directed and produced by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, with special effects by Willis H. O'Brien and music by Max Steiner. Produced and distributed by RKO Radio Pictures, \"King Kong\" is the first film in the self-titled franchise, combining live action sequences with stop-motion animation using rear-screen projection. The idea for the film came when Cooper decided to create a motion picture about a giant gorilla struggling against modern civilization. The film stars Fay Wray, Robert Armstrong, and Bruce Cabot. The film follows a giant ape dubbed Kong who feels affection for a beautiful young woman offered to him as a sacrifice. \n\"King Kong\" premiered in New York City on March 2, 1933, to many rave reviews, with praise for its stop-motion animation and musical score. During its initial run, the film earned a profit of $650,000, which increased to $2,847,000 by the time of its re-release in 1952. Various scenes were deleted by censors, and in 1970, they were restored. Later, in 1991, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically and aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 2010, the film was ranked by Rotten Tomatoes as the greatest horror film of all time and the fifty-sixth greatest film of all time. Various new editions of the film have also been released. A sequel, entitled \"Son of Kong,\" was made the same year as the original film, and several more films have been made, including two remakes in 1976 and 2005, respectively. The characters and story have since entered the public domain; the film's copyright is set to expire in 2029 in the US. Analysis of the film has included such topics as racial stereotypes, Ann's relationship with the other characters, and the struggle between nature and civilization.\nPlot.\nIn New York Harbor, filmmaker Carl Denham, known for wildlife films in remote exotic locations, is chartering Captain Englehorn's ship, the \"Venture,\" for his new project. However, he is unable to secure an actress for a female role he has been reluctant to disclose. In the streets of New York City, he finds struggling actress Ann Darrow and promises her \"the thrill of a lifetime\". The \"Venture\" sets off, during which Denham reveals that their destination is an uncharted island with a mountain the shape of a skull. He alludes to a mysterious entity named Kong, rumored to dwell on the island. The crew arrives and anchors offshore. They encounter a native village separated from the rest of the island by an enormous stone wall with a large wooden gate. They witness a group of natives preparing to sacrifice a young woman, termed the \"bride of Kong\". The intruders are spotted and the native chief stops the ceremony. When he sees the blonde-haired Ann, he offers to trade six of his tribal women for the \"golden woman\". They refuse him and return to the ship.\nThat night, after the ship's first mate, Jack Driscoll, admits his love for Ann, the natives kidnap Ann from the ship and take her through the gate and onto an altar. There she is offered to Kong, who is revealed to be a giant gorilla-like beast. Kong carries a terrified Ann away into the jungle as Denham, Jack, and some crewmen give chase. The men encounter living dinosaurs; they manage to kill a charging \"Stegosaurus\", but are attacked by an aggressive \"Brontosaurus\" and eventually Kong himself, leaving Jack and Denham as the only survivors. After Kong slays a \"Tyrannosaurus\" to save Ann, Jack keeps following them while Denham returns to the village. Upon arriving in Kong's mountain lair, Ann is menaced by a serpent-like \"Elasmosaurus\", which Kong also kills. When a \"Pteranodon\" tries to fly away with Ann, and is killed by Kong, Jack saves her and they climb down a vine dangling from a cliff ledge. When Kong starts pulling them back up, the two drop into the water below; they flee back to the village, where Denham, Englehorn, and the surviving crewmen await. Kong pursues, breaks open the gate, and relentlessly rampages through the village. Onshore, Denham, determined to bring Kong back alive, renders him unconscious with a gas bomb.\nShackled in chains, Kong is taken to New York City and presented to a Broadway theatre audience as, \"King Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World!\" Ann and Jack join him on stage, surrounded by press photographers. The ensuing flash photography causes Kong to break loose as the audience flees in terror. Ann is whisked away to a hotel room on a high floor, but Kong scales the building and reclaims her. He makes his way through the city with Ann in his grasp, wrecks a crowded elevated train, and begins climbing the Empire State Building. Jack suggests that airplanes shoot Kong off the building without hitting Ann. Four biplanes take off; seeing them arrive, Jack becomes agitated for Ann's safety and rushes inside with Denham. At the top, Kong is shot at by the planes as he swats at them. Kong destroys one, but is wounded by the gunfire. After he gazes at Ann, he is shot more, loses his strength, and plummets to the streets below to his death. Jack reunites with Ann. Denham heads back down and is allowed through a crowd surrounding Kong's corpse in the street. When a policeman remarks that the planes got him, Denham sadly states, \"Oh, no, it wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast.\"\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Fay Wray as Ann Darrow\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\n\"King Kong\" co-director Ernest B. Schoedsack had earlier experience filming monkeys while directing \"\" (1927), also with Merian C. Cooper, and \"Rango\" (1931), both of which prominently featured monkeys in authentic jungle settings. Capitalizing on this trend, Congo Pictures released the hoax documentary \"Ingagi\" (1930), advertising the film as \"an authentic incontestable celluloid document showing the sacrifice of a living woman to mammoth gorillas.\" \"Ingagi\" is now often recognized as a racial exploitation film as it implicitly depicted black women having sex with gorillas and baby offspring that looked more ape than human. The film was an immediate hit, and by some estimates, it was one of the highest-grossing films of the 1930s at over $4 million. Although Cooper never listed \"Ingagi\" among his influences for \"King Kong,\" it has long been held that RKO greenlighted \"Kong\" because of the bottom-line example of \"Ingagi\" and the formula that \"gorillas plus sexy women in peril equals enormous profits.\"\nSince 1929 Cooper had wanted to create a film about gorillas. Inspired by the travels of his friend W. Douglas Burden, Cooper considered filming in the jungles of Komodo. He had read Burden's \"The Dragon Lizards of Komodo\" and as a result conceived the idea to film a gorilla fighting giant lizards. Cooper later remarked that this was \"the most important influence\" on the final film. By the time he joined RKO in 1931, Cooper decided to incorporate a \"beauty and the beast\" theme into the plot. The \"Arabian proverb\" at the beginning of the film was created by Cooper: \"And lo! The Beast looked upon the face of Beauty, and it stayed its hand from killing. And from that day, it was as one dead.\" Initially Cooper planned to film in Africa and Komodo Island, but the idea was abandoned when RKO executives decided it would be too expensive. RKO was at risk for bankruptcy because of the Great Depression. Stop-motion animator Willis O'Brien, hearing that Cooper wanted to make a gorilla film, painted a picture depicting a large gorilla carrying a woman and gave it to Cooper. Afterward Cooper requested a test reel, which was approved by Selznick. O'Brien experimented with different scenes in the test reel. These two scenes, which were incorporated into the final film, portray a fight between King Kong and a Tyrannosaurus Rex as well as Kong shaking men off a log. The test reel was created concurrently with the production of \"The Most Dangerous Game.\" Meanwhile, Cooper hired actors and had sets built for \"King Kong\". For live-action sequences in the jungle, Cooper utilized the set of \"The Most Dangerous Game\". Cooper directed the live-action sequences until Schoedsack completed work on \"The Most Dangerous Game.\" Afterward Shoedsack directed the live action scenes while Cooper focused on the live action scenes that were to be combined with the already-filmed animated sequences. Marcel Delgado developed sample models of King Kong, the dinosaurs, and the people; the models did not have armatures. After about three months the test reel was complete. After studio executives approved the film for production, Cooper developed the story further. O'Brien's ideas also helped with story development. He suggested that King Kong be seen by the characters as a sort of deity. \nFilming commenced without a complete screenplay. Cooper hired Edgar Wallace to write the screenplay, which he started in December 1931. Cooper told Wallace what he wanted included in the script. Wallace's draft included several instances of attempted sexual assault, which were later removed by Ruth Rose. His draft also included racial tensions between characters. While drafting he wrote, \"I am hoping still to get a good horror picture without corpses, and I am certain that \"Kong\" is going to be a wow.\" Wallace had a rough draft ready in January 1932 and died a month later\".\" Some of his ideas ended up in the final film, such as Kong removing Ann's clothes from her body. He also roughly outlined the New York scenes, which were similar to how they appeared in the completed film, as well as a jungle chase scene. James A. Creelman picked up work on the screenplay. In his draft he changed character roles, making Denham Ann's cruel uncle. Cooper disliked it, remarking that \"The heavy is far too heavy.\" Creelman adapted Wallace's jungle chase scene to appear as it does in the finished film. Creelman found it difficult to meet Cooper's plot requests, feeling that there were too many fantastical elements for the film to be believable. He objected, \"[T]here is certainly such a thing as reaching a limit to the number of elements a story can contain and make sense.\" Though he incorporated Cooper's requests, the dialogue proved to be too extensive. Cooper was unsatisfied with Creelman's work, and in June Creelman decided to quit. After some difficulty finding a replacement for Creelman, in July Cooper hired Ruth Rose, who had never written a screenplay before. She rewrote the majority of Creelman's dialogue. Though Creelman initially wrote the film's New York prologue, Rose polished it while writing most of the city scenes. Rose was able to incorporate the love story between Ann and Jack, something the other screenwriters had struggled with. Rose also added more \"fairy tale-like\" aspects. Upon the film's release Wallace was credited with the screenplay, as Cooper had promised to give him the credit. The studio also saw it as an opportunity to gain positive publicity because Wallace was a well-established writer.\nCopyright concerns.\nThe creators of \"King Kong\" took inspiration from other films such as \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\". The influence was heavy enough that RKO executives were worried about copyright violation. Executives discussed the potential issue with RKO's lawyers. Also among their concerns were the film's connections to \"Ingagi\", \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\", \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\", and \"The Lost World\". The other works being ruled out, Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Lost World\" posed the most concern. Both \"The Lost World\" and \"King Kong\" concerned primitive creatures being taken to modern society. Even though Cooper argued against the similarities, the studio purchased the novel's copyright. Afterward Cooper feared that if the studio were to connect Doyle's name to the film for promotional purposes, consumers might not think the film was fresh. Eventually the Doyle estate granted the studio permission to not associate the film with Doyle's name.\nSpecial effects.\n\"King Kong\" is groundbreaking in the use of special effects, such as stop-motion animation, matte painting, rear projection, and miniatures. The prehistoric creatures inhabiting Skull Island were brought to life through the use of stop-motion animation by Willis H. O'Brien and his assistant animators, E. B. \"Buzz\" Gibson, Carroll Shepphird, Marcel Delgado, Orville Goldner, and Fred Reefe. The stop-motion animation scenes were painstaking and difficult to achieve and complete. The special effects crew could not leave the studio during the day because the lighting would not be consistent. The jungle scenery was created by layering glass paintings, which were created by Mario Larrinaga and Byron L. Crabbe. They were used when Denham's crew first arrives. The scene was composited with separate bird elements and rear-projected behind the ship and actors.\nThe most difficult task for the special effects crew to achieve was to make live-action footage interact with separately filmed stop-motion animation, making the interaction between the humans and the creatures seem believable. The most simple of these effects were accomplished by exposing part of the frame, then running the same piece of the film through the camera again by exposing the other part of the frame with a different image. This process is called a matte. The most complex shots, where the live-action actors interacted with the stop-motion animation, were achieved via two different techniques, the Dunning process and the Williams process, to produce the effect of a traveling matte.\nAnother technique that was used in combining live actors and stop-motion animation was rear-screen projection. The actor would have a translucent screen behind him where a projector would project footage onto the back of the translucent screen. This was the first film for which RKO used the method. It was used in the scene where Kong and the \"Tyrannosaurus\" fight while Ann watches from the branches of a nearby tree. The stop-motion animation was filmed first. Afterward Fay Wray spent a 22-hour period sitting in a fake tree acting out her observation of the battle, which was projected onto the translucent screen while the camera filmed her witnessing the projected stop-motion battle. She was sore for days after the shoot. The same process was also used for the scene where sailors from the \"Venture\" kill a Stegosaurus. O'Brien and his special effects crew also devised a way to use rear projection in miniature sets. A tiny screen was built into the miniature onto which live-action footage would then be projected. A fan was used to prevent the footage that was projected from melting or catching fire. This miniature rear projection was used in the scene where Kong tries to grab Driscoll, who is hiding in a cave. For the scene in which Kong places Ann in a tree, Wray acted out her sequences as Kong's sequences were projected in the rear. She was unable to clearly see the projected images and had to act based on the blurs she saw. Animation for the film was completed after 55 weeks.\nCooper, wishing to create a point of authenticity, insisted that Kong not be played by an actor in a gorilla suit. Over the years, some media reports have alleged that in certain scenes Kong was played by an actor wearing a gorilla suit. However, film historians have generally agreed that all scenes involving Kong were achieved with animated models. These models were about in height. They were made of metal armatures padded with cotton, latex, and rabbit fur. The fur moved as the animators handled the models, becoming an unintentional feature of Kong. The models required maintenance after each day of filming. Closeups of Kong's face and upper body were accomplished by filming a full-size mechanical model of Kong's head and shoulders, designed by Delgado. The model, scaled to the dimensions of a fifty-foot creature, was covered with forty bearskins. Six operators were required to manipulate the eyes and mouth to simulate a living monster. A proportionally large arm and paw were also created for closeup shots of Kong holding Ann. Dinosaur models were reused from O'Brien's aborted film project \"Creation.\" Production was completed in January 1933. Production costs added up to $672,254.75, part of which included costs for \"Creation\".\nSound effects and score.\nMurray Spivack developed the sound effects for the film. Kong's roar was created by mixing the recorded vocals of lions and tigers and slowly playing them backward. Spivak himself provided Kong's \"love grunts\" by grunting into a megaphone and playing it at a slow speed. For Kong's footsteps, Spivak stomped across a gravel-filled box with plungers attached to his feet and wrapped in foam. The sounds of Kong's chest beats are recordings of Spivak hitting his assistant, who had a microphone held to his back, on the chest with a drumstick. Spivak created the hisses and croaks of the dinosaurs with an air compressor for the former and his own vocals for the latter. The vocalizations of the Tyrannosaurus were additionally mixed in with puma growls. Spivak also provided the screams of the various sailors. Fay Wray herself provided all of her character's screams in a single recording session. Wray explained that afterward she \"couldn't speak even in a whisper for days\". Her screams have been used in other movies such as \"Son of Kong\" and \"Game of Death\".\nEven though funding for the film was nearly gone, Cooper and Schoedsack decided it needed an original score because they worried that Kong might be too unbelievable as a character and also did not want to use a generic soundtrack. They hired Max Steiner for the job. Steiner began composing the score on December 9, 1932, and completed it after eight weeks. The orchestra comprised 46 members, but upon recording sounded so full it is sometimes described as having 80 members. A 46-member orchestra was large compared to many other film orchestras of the time. According to Steiner, Cooper paid him $50,000 of his own money to pay for the orchestra.\nSteiner decided to make the music, in his own words, \"impressionistic and terrifying\". During composition he took inspiration from Debussy and Ravel, specifically for the music that was to play during the ocean scene when Denham and his crew travel to Skull Island. During this scene \"Boat in the Fog\" begins to play; the harp reflects the waves and the stringed instruments reflect of the fog. Steiner also incorporated dissonance into the score for action scenes, such as when Kong falls to his death. Laurence MacDonald explains that this dissonance is also reflective of Debussy's compositions. The ocean scene is the first instance in which music begins to play. This is because Steiner wanted an association between music and the film's fantasy elements. Music historian Michael Slowik suggests that such an association invokes a sense of the unfamiliar, also pointing out that music is connected to the audience's need to suspend belief. Music does not play during Kong's fight with the T-rex and is replaced by animal sounds, making it the only Skull Island scene without music. Music plays in the later New York City scenes except for when the airplanes surround Kong. One of the techniques that Steiner often wrote into the score is called mickey-mousing. MacDonald dubs it \"perhaps the single most noteworthy aspect of Steiner's score\". According to Slowik, the score includes more mickey-mousing than other film scores of its period. He remarks that its \"obsessive mickey-mousing\" is reminiscent of the music that would play for a cartoon rather than for a Hollywood production. In one scene the chief of the island people walks toward Denham's group and the music aligns with his steps. The score also reflects actions happening off-screen, such as when Kong walks toward the altar where Ann is to be offered to him. Formerly, this technique had been used for silent films.\nSlowik identifies three musical themes throughout the score: Kong's theme, Ann's theme, and the jungle theme. Steiner took inspiration from Wagner in creating Kong's theme. Steiner used a method called chromaticism in Kong's theme, which comprises three descending notes. According to Peter Franklin, the other themes stem from the three-note sequence in Kong's theme. \"King Kong March\", a Broadway-style score played during Denham's show, is an adaptation of Kong's theme, though the notes ascend rather than descend. Ann's theme (\"Stolen Love\") is a Viennese waltz and begins with notes similar to those in Kong's theme. Steiner eventually combined both themes in one song just before Kong dies. Musician biographer Steven C. Smith identifies what he calls the \"danger theme\". It is written with four notes and is meant to sound \"questioning\". It first appears in \"The Forgotten Island\". Later, it is reworked into a major key when Driscoll confesses his love for Ann. Smith suggests that this points to what he calls \"the perils of romance\". Later in life Cooper expressed that \"much of the reason for [\"King Kong\"'s success] is because Maxie Steiner was able to create what no other man that I knew of in Hollywood at that time could\". Steiner himself remarked that the film \"was made for music\".\nUpon the film's release its score received little critical review, being overshadowed by the film's innovations in special effects. However, it received more attention as the movie became more famous in the years that followed. Christopher Palmer wrote that the score \"marked the real beginnings of Hollywood music\". Mervyn Cooke adds that it \"almost single-handedly marked the coming-of-age of nondiegetic film music\". In his book \"After the Silents: Hollywood Film Music in the Early Sound Era, 1926\u20131934,\" Slowik argues that \"King Kong\"'s score did not influence Hollywood film scores that many music scholars think it did. He suggests that, because the movie was unusual, the score was unable to introduce an alternate way to write film scores. He also suggests that Steiner drew upon already-established patterns of Hollywood music. He writes that rather than single-handedly shaping the Golden Age of Hollywood music, King Kong is just one film among others that helped shape it. Slowik explains that the score features both \"original and symphonic music\", something that was not common in film scores of the time. Portions of the score were reused in \"Double Harness\", \"The Last Days of Pompeii\", and \"The Last of the Mohicans\", among others. The island music appears as an orchestra scene in Jackson's 2005 remake. Over the years, Steiner's score was recorded by multiple record labels and the original motion picture soundtrack has been issued on a compact disc.\nRelease and censorship.\nInitial release and box office.\nKing Kong\u2019s campaign included newspaper ads, radio ads, and posters. It premiered in the Radio City Music Hall and RKO Roxy in New York City on March 2, 1933. U. S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared the four-day nationwide bank holiday three days after the film's premiere in New York City. The film was a box-office success and during the opening weekend earned an estimated $90,000. Receipts fell by up to 50% during the second week of the film's release because of the national bank holiday. Attendance of the film dropped within the second and third weeks of its New York release. During the film's first run it made a profit of $650,000. Before the 1952 re-release, the film is reported to have worldwide rentals of $2,847,000 including $1,070,000 from the United States and Canada and profits of $1,310,000. The Hollywood premiere was held on March 24, 1933, in Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theatre. The screening was preceded by a performance featuring dances of Indigenous people and trapeze performances. It was not officially released until April 7, 1933. It was re-released in 1952 following the promising re-release of \"Snow White\". After the 1952 re-release, \"Variety\" estimated the film had earned an additional $1.6 million in the United States and Canada, bringing its total to $3.9 million in cumulative rentals in the United States. Profits from the re-release were estimated by the studio to be at about $2.5 million, which was about double of what the film earned in 1933.\nCensorship and restorations.\nThe Production Code's stricter rules were put into effect in Hollywood after the film's 1933 premiere and it was progressively censored further, with several scenes being either trimmed or excised altogether for the 1938\u20131956 rereleases. Censors removed the scene of the Brontosaurus mauling crewmen in the water, chasing one up a tree and killing him. They also removed the scenes where Kong undresses Ann Darrow, bites and steps on people. The scene where Kong mistakes a sleeping woman for Ann and drops her to her death after realizing his mistake was also removed. An additional scene portraying giant insects, spiders, a reptile-like predator and a tentacled creature devouring the crew members shaken off the log by Kong onto the floor of the canyon below was deemed too gruesome by RKO even by pre-Code standards. Cooper thought it \"stopped the story\", and thus the scene was censored by the studio before the original release. Members of the preview audience also left the film early because they were concerned about the scene. The footage is considered lost, except for only a few stills and pre-production drawings. There are also claims that it was never filmed and was only in the script and novelization.\nThe film was initially banned in Nazi Germany, with the censors describing it as an \"attack against the nerves of the German people\" and a \"violation of German race feeling\". Shortly following its release the film was also banned in Finland for violence; the ban was released in 1939. RKO did not preserve copies of the film's negative or release prints with the excised footage, and the cut scenes were considered lost for many years. In 1969, a 16mm print, including the censored footage, was found in Philadelphia. The cut scenes were added to the film, restoring it to its original theatrical running time of 100 minutes. This version was re-released to art houses by Janus Films in 1970. Over the next two decades, Universal Studios undertook further photochemical restoration of \"King Kong.\" This was based on a 1942 release print with missing censor cuts taken from a 1937 print, which \"contained heavy vertical scratches from projection.\" An original release print located in the UK in the 1980s was found to contain the cut scenes in better quality. After a 6-year worldwide search for the best surviving materials, a further, fully digital restoration utilizing 4K resolution scanning was completed by Warner Bros. in 2005. This restoration also had a 4-minute overture added, bringing the overall running time to 104 minutes. The project was funded by The Film Foundation and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Somewhat controversially, \"King Kong\" was colorized for a 1989 Turner Home Entertainment video release.\nTelevision and home media.\nAfter the 1956 re-release, the film was sold to television and was first broadcast on March 5, 1956\". King Kong\" had numerous VHS and LaserDisc releases of varying quality before receiving an official studio release on DVD. In 1984, \"King Kong\" was one of the first films to be released on LaserDisc as part of the Criterion Collection, and was the first movie to have an audio commentary track included. Criterion's audio commentary was by film historian Ron Haver. The Haver commentary was available on the FilmStruck streaming service. Image Entertainment released another LaserDisc around 1993. The VHS release from Turner was a 60th-anniversary edition in 1992 featuring a front cover that had the sound effect of Kong roaring when his chest was pressed. It had orders for over 140,000 copies, with the colorized version being preferred. It also included a 25-minute documentary, \"It Was Beauty Killed the Beast\" (1992). \nIn 2005, Warner Bros. released its digital restoration of \"King Kong\" in a US 2-disc Special Edition DVD, coinciding with the theatrical release of Peter Jackson's remake. The restoration was funded partially by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. The DVD release had numerous extra features, including a new, third audio commentary by visual effects artists Ray Harryhausen and Ken Ralston, with archival excerpts from actress Fay Wray and producer/director Merian C. Cooper. At \"American Cinematographer\", Kenneth Sweeney found the extras on disc 1 lackluster for such an important release. Disc 2 included more in-depth features, with a short biographical film on Cooper, and \"RKO Production 601: The Making of \"King Kong\"\", produced by Peter Jackson. Disc 2 included additional interviews with many relevant people. The DVD was also sold in a limited edition with \"Son of Kong\" and \"Mighty Joe Young\" Warners issued a US digibook-packaged Blu-ray in 2010. Rudy Behlmer wrote the accompanying 32-page booklet. \nReception.\nContemporary.\n\"King Kong\" received generally positive reviews upon its release. Meehan of \"Motion Picture Herald\" predicted it would be \"one of the sensational pictures of the year\", opining that \"no more thrilling climax ever was filmed\". A reviewer for \"The Hollywood Reporter\" claimed the film \"bears all the earmarks of a winner\", predicting it would make \"plenty of money\". Another review in the same periodical declared it was \"superbly produced-acted\", a \"great piece of imagination, hatched in the brain of a showman for showmen\". A \"Motion Picture Herald\" review by McCarthy called \"King Kong\" \"imagination-stunning\" and praised the \"buildup of suspense\", dubbing it \"a showman's picture\". The \"Chicago Tribune\" called it \"one of the most original, thrilling and mammoth novelties to emerge from a movie studio.\" The New York Times gave readers an enthusiastic account of the plot and thought the film a fascinating adventure. The \"New York World-Telegram\" said it was \"one of the very best of all the screen thrillers, done with all the cinema's slickest camera tricks.\" \n\"The Film Daily\" wrote, \"The picture has plenty of shocker stuff, and the terror is heightened by [Fay Wray's screaming], while the film's musical score adds its blare to keep the audience in a state of turmoil.\" The reviewer cautioned that \"some women and children\" might dislike the film's intensity. John Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" called it \"ridiculous,\" but wrote that there were \"many scenes in this picture that are certainly diverting.\" Joe Bigelow of \"Variety\" thought the film held \"power\" once a viewer got used to the \"phoney atmosphere\". He remarked that \"a few details were too strong to swallow the picture\" and the technical innovations overshadowed the plot and acting. The film's \"many flaws\", he added, were \"overcome by the general results\". \"Newsweek\" wrote that Cooper and Schoedsack were no longer \"scientists\" because the film was \"exaggerated in its faked views of wild life\".\n\"The Hollywood Reporter\" included a multi-page booklet in its March issue, featuring production stills and concept sketches alongside critical praise for the film. The booklet was the program for the film's Los Angeles premiere. \nRecent.\nEd Symkus of \"USA Today\" claims the film \"stands tall as a groundbreaking piece of jaw-dropping, eye-widening entertainment\". The Washington City Paper called it \"a movie upon whose foundation we\u2019ve built a sizable section of contemporary pop culture\". Film historian Michael Price calls the film \"the product of a remarkable group of daredevils, artists, and craftsmen.\" Brian Eggert claims that \"\"King Kong's\" greatness remains in part because it demonstrates a compendium of Classic Hollywood production strategies.\" He additionally praises the music as \"guid[ing] every emotion\". Almar Haflidason of BBC praises the \"fantastic atmosphere\" of the score and the \"richness of Kong's character.\" Haflidason adds that the animation is \u201ctechnically brilliant [and] highly imaginative in terms of cinematic action\u201d. Roger Ebert included \"King Kong\" in his \"Great Movies\" list, writing that \"in the very artificiality of some of the special effects, there is a creepiness that isn't there in today's slick, flawless, computer-aided images... Even allowing for its slow start, wooden acting, and wall-to-wall screaming, there is something ageless and primeval about \"King Kong\" that still somehow works.\" \nJames Berardinelli writes that \"advances in technology and acting have dated aspects of the production\". He also adds that the acting is weak and that he feels \"some sense of awe\" in consideration of the special effects. \"The Guardian\" pointed out Kong's perceptible size changes, and remarked that compared to today's filmmaking techniques, \"King Kong\" \"has ceased to be the thriller...and has become of the best comedies seen for years\". In its review \"Time\" wrote that Kong \"sometimes doubled in size\". TIFF wrote that it is \"reductive in its portrayal of humans, especially the Indigenous people\". \nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 116 reviews, with an average rating of 9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"King Kong\" explores the soul of a monster \u2013 making audiences scream and cry throughout the film \u2013 in large part due to Kong's breakthrough special effects.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 92 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nAnalysis.\nRacial stereotypes.\n\"King Kong\" has undergone extensive analysis of its portrayal of race. NPR producer Robert Malesky remarks that, \"To many, the eroticism and racism of the original film are just side themes and part of the fabric of 1930s America.\" Author Ryan Britt feels that critics were willing to overlook the film's problematic aspects as \"just unattractive byproducts of the era in which the film was made\". He adds, \"the meta-fictional aspects almost excuse some of the cultural insensitivity\". In the 19th and early 20th century, people of African descent were commonly represented visually as ape-like, a metaphor that fit racist stereotypes further bolstered by the emergence of scientific racism. Early films frequently mirrored racial tensions. While \"King Kong\" is often compared to the story of \"Beauty and the Beast,\" many film scholars have argued that the film was a cautionary tale about interracial romance, in which the film's \"carrier of blackness is not a human being, but an ape.\" Jordan Zakarin of \"Inverse\" quotes author John Michlig, who explains that even though many modern viewers see the film as racist, it exhibits 1930s perceptions of obscure locations and peoples.\nThe film has been criticized for racial stereotyping of the native people and Charlie the cook, the latter of whom exclaims, \"Crazy black man been here!\" when he discovers Ann has been kidnapped. Filmmaker Fatimah Rony argues that Charlie is feminized in his occupation and gesticulations. She also views the native people's \"savagery\" as being associated with their dark skin. In 2013 \"Atlanta Black Star\" described the people native to the island \"as subhuman, or primate...[without] a distinct way of communicating\". Rony points out that African Americans and a Yaqui man were cast to portray Indonesian people. In her view, racial undertones are present when Ann is preferred for the sacrifice rather than the girl who is native to Skull Island. Wayne State University film professor Cynthia Erb remarks that \"Ann's prized whiteness\" is \"the most disturbing racial\" component, rather than \"Kong's blackness\". Erb explains that in jungle films \"the depiction of natives was often patronizing, stereotypical, racist.\" She adds, \"I think it does happen with the Skull Islanders.\"\nCritics have also seen Kong himself as a perpetuation of racial tensions. \"Atlanta Black Star\" perceived a racial allegory between Kong and black men, remarking that Kong \"meets his demise due to his insatiable desire for a white woman\". Erb argues that the portrayal of Kong is one of a \"noble savage\" and a fighter rather than a \"sexual aggressor\". In her analysis Rony relates Kong to the \"noble savage\" because he fights off the dinosaurs due to his affection for Ann. She remarks that Kong is \"not exclusively black\", as he is connected to Asia due to his Eastern-inspired name as well as the Indonesian location of Skull Island. She calls it \"one of the most outrageous 'racial films' ever made\", opining that it is one among several films of the time that portrays a person with African, Asian, or Pacific Islander ancestry \"as an ape-monster\". According to Rony, Cooper decided to make Ann blonde to emphasize the difference between her and Kong, and as a white woman she was established as \"a kind of lure for the monster-like beast\". Her fair complexion contrasts with his dark complexion, which film analyst Rhona Berenstein argues is implicitly associated with his \"monstrosity\".\nConcerns surrounding biracial interactions in the film have also arisen. Rony claims the film \"ultimately celebrates cinema's tendency to create monsters which mirror the anxieties of any given age\". According to Rony, Kong symbolizes biracial sexual relationships, which were looked down upon at the time of the film's release. Berenstein sees Kong and Ann's relationship as \"a vehicle for racial crossing\", arguing that the film both \"confirms\" and \"destablizes\" the idea of \"white supremacy\". She explains that Ann serves as a warning against and as a summons for \"the monstrous possibility of miscegenation\". Writer James A. Snead and German Studies professor Dagmar Lorenz compare Denham to a colonialist and link Kong's capture to the slave trade. Erb takes the idea of Denham as colonialist to argue that, following the prologue, the film appears to \"challenge\" colonialism. Zakarin claims that elements that may be seen as disturbing stemmed from what Cooper believed would make the film adventurous.\nAnn's relationships.\nThe film has been called sexist in its portrayal of women. J. P. Telotte claims that the film \"sets up a pattern of repression\" in the largely male ship crew as well as with Denham's and Jack's \"antiromantic remarks\". According to author Joseph Andriano, the film attempts to reduce the idea of sexism by creating a relationship between King Kong and Ann. He adds that this attempt does not work because Ann is portrayed as helpless. Because Kong's eventual downfall results from \"feminine charm\", Andriano suggests that the film implies a \"helpless female\" is more powerful than an able male. According to Rhona Berenstein, screaming women are \"central to [the] jungle-horror\" genre. Denham coaches Ann's screaming when there is nothing to scream at. Berenstein remarks that this coached screaming may bleed into her reaction to Kong, rendering it a performance. She furthers the argument by stating that the practiced screaming indicates that Ann's and Kong's relationship \"is not simply that between a victim and a monster\", adding that Ann's victimization via Kong comes only after she seeks independence.\nBerenstein parallels Ann's sacrifice to Kong with Denham's Kong exhibit in New York City, suggesting that this makes Ann and Kong \"both doubles and adversaries\". She views the film as creating a relatability between \"people of color, a white woman, and a simian monster\". Mark Rubinstein parallels Kong's New York rampage to his efforts to protect Ann on Skull Island, remarking that Kong both protects Ann and acts as if she belongs to him. Rubinstein argues that the proverb appearing at the film's beginning warns about love, specifically that if a man is romantically attracted to a woman he will experience a \"downfall\". He argues that Ann does not return Kong's affection. Wray herself claimed that Ann had no romantic feelings for Kong but instead feared him.\nIt has also been suggested that Ann is under Denham's control. Erb remarks that while Kong seeks a romantic relationship with Ann, Denham seeks to earn money because of her. She explains that Denham appears \"control-oriented\" to modern viewers, whereas to 1930s viewers he would have appeared \"more as the enterprising showman\". According to Rony and Berenstein, Ann is controlled by Denham, who uses her \"as an object of trade and of spectacle\", subjecting her to the male gaze while practicing her screams under Denham's direction. Snead remarks that in the film women become \"a sort of visual capital\" rather than \"people or potential partners\".\nNature and civilization.\nWhile Cooper and Schoedsack insisted in contemporary interviews that there was no hidden meaning to \"King Kong,\" a posthumously published interview with Cooper revealed that his inspiration for the film was rooted in the image of a giant ape falling from the tallest building, which would represent how primitive people are doomed by modern civilization. This idea has been taken up in scholarly analysis of the film. In her analysis Erb focuses on the struggle between primitivism and civilization. In her view, Kong invokes a sense of primitivism and symbolizes nature, while Denham symbolizes modern society. The film, she argues, demonstrates \"nature's revenge on culture\" and nature's eventual defeat. While Erb explains that she does not disagree with views of the film involving sexism and racism, she argues that Kong's interactions with Ann reach beyond race and sex. She argues that when Kong partially undresses Ann, it \"initiate[s] her into the realm of the wild\". Touching her and smelling her clothes are primitivist actions, Erb suggests, because it focuses on senses other than sight. Heavy reliance on sight is associated with modern society. Erb explains that Kong's alternation of aggressiveness and gentleness \"arguably embodies both the demonic and Edenic impulses of the jungle tradition\" common in 1930s film. According to Erb, through contrast Skull Island is set up as a counterpart to New York City.\nTelotte takes a similar approach, pointing out that many of the island scenes reflect the events of the city scenes. According to Telotte, Kong is taken from an \"Edenic world\" to be exploited in the modern world. Kong's New York City rampage is an \"effort to tear down the base of modern culture itself\". Dagmar Lorenz argues that the film establishes \"Western civilization as the source of Kong's destruction\" and explains that portraying Skull Island's \"wildness\" seems to convey an idea of \"barbarity\". Tom Shales of \"The Washington Post\" takes a different approach, suggesting that the film is \"an allegory about modern man, sort of, facing his own nature\", rather than about beauty killing the beast.\nSocial Impact During the Great Depression.\nThe weekend after Kong\u2019s release, newly-elected President Franklin Roosevelt ordered a bank holiday to halt the panic in the financial sector. Innovation historian Jason Voiovich calls the film \"The First Popcorn Movie,\" making the case that King Kong helped nervous people process the extreme economic stress. The movie served its purpose as an escape on one level, but on another, the monster represented the fear of the Great Depression and that people could conquer it in the end.\nLegacy and franchise.\nLegacy.\nSince its release the film has received some significant honors. In 1975, \"Kong\" was named one of the 50 best American films by the American Film Institute. Around this time it also gained academic attention. In 1981 a video game titled \"Donkey Kong,\" starring a character with similarities to Kong, was released. In 1991, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically and aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. In 1998, the AFI ranked the film #43 on its list of the 100 greatest movies of all time.\nThe film's stop motion effects by Willis H. O'Brien left a lasting impact on the film industry worldwide and inspired other genre films such as \"Mighty Joe Young\", \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\", \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\", \"Mothra\", and \"Jurassic Park\". The film was also one of the biggest inspirations for \"Godzilla,\" with Tomoyuki Tanaka stating, \"I felt like doing something big. That was my motivation. I thought of different ideas. I like monster movies, and I was influenced by King Kong.\"\nDaiei Film, the company which later produced \"Gamera\", \"Daimajin\" and other tokusatsu films, distributed the 1952 re-release of \"King Kong\" in Japan, making it the first post-war release of monster movies in the country. The company also distributed \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\" in Japan in 1954, and these distributions presumably influenced productions of both \"Godzilla\" and \"Gamera\" franchises.\nAuthor Daniel Loxton suggested that \"King Kong\" inspired the modern day legend of the Loch Ness Monster.\nIn 2025, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" listed \"King Kong\" as having the best stunts of 1932 to 1933.\nSequel and franchise.\nDelos W. Lovelace was hired by Cooper to compose a novel version of \"King Kong\". Lovelace appeared as the author alongside the credit \"conceived by Edgar Wallace and Merian C. Cooper\". Walter Ripperger wrote a two-part serial version for \"Mystery\", which was credited as \"the last creation of Edgar Wallace\".\nThe film and characters inspired imitations and installments. The same year of \"King Kong\"'s release, \"Son of Kong,\" a sequel, was fast-tracked and released. In the 1960s, RKO licensed the King Kong character to Japanese studio Toho, which made two films, \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\", the third film in Toho's long-running\" Godzilla\" series, and \"King Kong Escapes.\" Both were directed by Ishir\u014d Honda. These films are mostly unrelated to the original and follow a very different style. In 1976 producer Dino De Laurentiis released a modern remake of \"King Kong.\" It follows the same basic plot, but the setting is moved to the present day and several other details are different. This remake was followed by a 1986 sequel \"King Kong Lives.\" In 1998, a loosely-adapted direct-to-video animated version, \"The Mighty Kong,\" was distributed by Warner Bros. In 2005, Universal Pictures released another remake of \"King Kong,\" co-written and directed by Peter Jackson, which is set in the 1930s, as in the original film. Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros. made ' (2017), which serves as part of a cinematic universe, \"MonsterVerse,\" followed by the sequels \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" (2021) and ' (2024).\nThe search for censored scenes inspired a play called \"Censored Scenes from King Kong,\" performed in 1980. A reviewer in \"The Hollywood Reporter\" called it the \"worst offering\" in a bad season.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16788", "revid": "20126179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16788", "title": "Kenning", "text": "Figure of speech\nA kenning (Icelandic: ) is a figure of speech, a figuratively-phrased compound term that is used in place of a simple single-word noun. For instance, the Old English kenning 'whale's road' () means 'sea', as does ('swan's road').\nA kenning has two parts: a base-word (also known as a head-word) and a determinant. So in \"whale's road\", \"road\" is the base-word, and \"whale's\" is the determinant. This is the same structure as in the modern English term \"skyscraper\"; the base-word here would be \"scraper\", and the determinant \"sky\". In some languages, kennings can recurse, with one element of the kenning being replaced by another kenning.\nKennings are strongly associated with Old Norse-Icelandic and Old English alliterative verse. They continued to be a feature of Icelandic poetry (including ) for centuries, together with the closely related . Although kennings are sometimes hyphenated in English translation, Old Norse poetry did not require kennings to be in normal word order, nor do the parts of the kenning need to be side-by-side. The lack of grammatical cases in modern English makes this aspect of kennings difficult to translate. Kennings are now rarely used in English, but are still used in the Germanic language family.\nEtymology.\nThe corresponding modern verb \"to ken\" survives in Scots and English dialects and in general English through the derivative existing in the standard language in the set expression \"beyond one's ken\", \"beyond the scope of one's knowledge\" and in the phonologically altered forms \"uncanny\", 'surreal, supernatural', and \"canny\", 'shrewd, prudent'. Modern Scots retains (with slight differences between dialects) 'to know', 'knew' or 'known', Afrikaans 'be acquainted with' and 'to know' and 'knowledge'. Old Norse (Modern Icelandic , Swedish , Danish , Norwegian or ) is cognate with Old English , Old Frisian , , Old Saxon () (Middle Dutch and Dutch ), Old High German (, , ) (Middle High German and German ), Gothic &lt; Proto-Germanic , originally causative of 'to know (how to)', whence Modern English \"can\" 'to be able'. The word ultimately derives from , the same Proto-Indo-European root that yields Modern English \"know\", Latin-derived terms such as \"cognition\" and \"ignorant\", and Greek .\nStructure.\nOld Norse kennings take the form of a genitive phrase ( 'wave's horse' = 'ship' (\u00deorbj\u00f6rn Hornklofi: Glymdr\u00e1pa 3)) or a compound word ( 'sea-steed' = 'ship' (Anon.: \"Hervararkvi\u00f0a\" 27)). The simplest kennings consist of a base-word (Icelandic , German ) and a determinant (Icelandic , German ) which qualifies, or modifies, the meaning of the base-word. The determinant may be a noun used uninflected as the first element in a compound word, with the base-word constituting the second element of the compound word. Alternatively the determinant may be a noun in the genitive case placed before or after the base-word, either directly or separated from the base-word by intervening words.\nThus the base-words in these examples are 'horse' and 'steed', the determinants 'waves' and 'sea'. The unstated noun which the kenning refers to is called its referent, in this case: 'ship'.\nThe base-word of the kenning ('icicle of red shields' [SWORD], Einarr Sk\u00falason: \"\u00d8xarflokkr\" 9) is ('ice, icicle') and the determinant is ('rim, shield-rim, shield'). The referent is 'sword'.\nIn Old Norse poetry, either component of a kenning (base-word, determinant or both) could consist of an ordinary noun or a \"heiti\" \"poetic synonym\". In the above examples, and are distinctively poetic lexemes; the normal word for 'horse' in Old Norse prose is .\nComplex kennings.\nThe skalds also employed complex kennings in which the determinant, or sometimes the base-word, is itself made up of a further kenning: 'feeder of war-gull' = 'feeder of raven' = 'warrior' (\u00deorbj\u00f6rn Hornklofi: \"Glymdr\u00e1pa\" 6); 'destroyers of eagle's hunger' = 'feeders of eagle' = 'warrior' (\u00deorbj\u00f6rn \u00deakkask\u00e1ld: Erlingsdr\u00e1pa 1) (referring to carrion birds scavenging after a battle). Where one kenning is embedded in another like this, the whole figure is said to be 'doubly determined, twice modified'.&lt;ref name=\"Faulkes 1999, p. 5/12\"&gt;Faulkes (1999), p. 5/12.&lt;/ref&gt;\nFrequently, where the determinant is itself a kenning, the base-word of the kenning that makes up the determinant is attached uninflected to the front of the base-word of the whole kenning to form a compound word: 'son-slayer of giantess' = 'slayer of sons of giantess' = 'slayer of giants' = 'the god Thor' (Steinunn Refsd\u00f3ttir: Lausav\u00edsa 2).\nIf the figure comprises more than three elements, it is said to be \"extended\". Kennings of up to seven elements are recorded in skaldic verse. Snorri himself characterises five-element kennings as an acceptable license but cautions against more extreme constructions: \"The ninth [license] is extending a kenning to the fifth determinant, but it is out of proportion if it is extended further. Even if it can be found in the works of ancient poets, we no longer tolerate it.\" The longest kenning found in skaldic poetry occurs in \"Hafger\u00f0ingadr\u00e1pa\" by \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0r Sj\u00e1reksson and reads 'fire-brandisher of blizzard of ogress of protection-moon of steed of boat-shed', which simply means 'warrior'.\nWord order and comprehension.\nWord order in Old Norse was generally much freer than in Modern English because Old Norse and Old English are synthetic languages, where added prefixes and suffixes to the root word (the core noun, verb, adjective or adverb) carry grammatical meanings, whereas Middle English and Modern English use word order to carry grammatical information, as analytic languages. This freedom is exploited to the full in skaldic verse and taken to extremes far beyond what would be natural in prose. Other words can intervene between a base-word and its genitive determinant, and occasionally between the elements of a compound word (tmesis). Kennings, and even whole clauses, can be interwoven. Ambiguity is usually less than it would be if an English text were subjected to the same contortions, thanks to the more elaborate morphology of Old Norse.\nAnother factor aiding comprehension is that Old Norse kennings tend to be highly conventional. Most refer to the same small set of topics, and do so using a relatively small set of traditional metaphors. Thus a leader or important man will be characterised as generous, according to one common convention, and called an \"enemy of gold\", \"attacker of treasure\", \"destroyer of arm-rings\", etc. and a friend of his people. Nevertheless, there are many instances of ambiguity in the corpus, some of which may be intentional, and some evidence that, rather than merely accepting it from expediency, skalds favoured contorted word order for its own sake.\nSemantics.\nKennings could be developed into extended, and sometimes vivid, metaphors: 'shields were trodden under the hard feet of the hilt (sword blades)' (Eyvindr Sk\u00e1ldaspillir: H\u00e1konarm\u00e1l 6); '' (Eyvindr Sk\u00e1ldaspillir: H\u00e1konarm\u00e1l 7). Snorri calls such examples and exemplifies them in verse 6 of his H\u00e1ttatal. The effect here seems to depend on an interplay of more or less naturalistic imagery and jarring artifice. But the skalds were not averse either to arbitrary, purely decorative, use of kennings: \"That is, a ruler will be a distributor of gold even when he is fighting a battle and gold will be called the fire of the sea even when it is in the form of a man's arm-ring on his arm. If the man wearing a gold ring is fighting a battle on land the mention of the sea will have no relevance to his situation at all and does not contribute to the picture of the battle being described\" (Faulkes (1997), pp.\u00a08\u20139).\nSnorri draws the line at mixed metaphor, which he terms 'made monstrous' (Snorri Sturluson: H\u00e1ttatal 6), and his nephew called the practice 'a fault' (\u00d3l\u00e1fr hv\u00edtask\u00e1ld: Third Grammatical Treatise 80). In spite of this, it seems that \"many poets did not object to and some must have preferred baroque juxtapositions of unlike kennings and neutral or incongruous verbs in their verses\" (Foote &amp; Wilson (1970), p.\u00a0332). E.g. 'listen, earl, to Kvasir's blood (=poetry)' (Einarr sk\u00e1laglamm: Vellekla 1).\nSometimes there is a kind of redundancy whereby the referent of the whole kenning, or a kenning for it, is embedded: 'brother of hostility-swallow' = 'brother of raven' = 'raven' (Oddr brei\u00f0fir\u00f0ingr: Illugadr\u00e1pa 1); 'gleam-harmers of the land of rings' = 'harmers of gleam of arm' = 'harmers of ring' = 'leaders, nobles, men of social standing (conceived of as generously destroying gold, i.e. giving it away freely)' (Anon.: L\u00edknarbraut 42).\nWhile some Old Norse kennings are relatively transparent, many depend on a knowledge of specific myths or legends. Thus the sky might be called naturalistically 'squall-vat' (Mark\u00fas Skeggjason: Eir\u00edksdr\u00e1pa 3) or described in mythical terms as 'Ymir's skull' (Arn\u00f3rr jarlask\u00e1ld: Magn\u00fasdr\u00e1pa 19), referring to the idea that the sky was made out of the skull of the primeval giant Ymir. Still others name mythical entities according to certain conventions without reference to a specific story: 'Odin of battle' = 'warrior' (Arn\u00f3rr jarlask\u00e1ld: Magn\u00fasdr\u00e1pa 5).\nPoets in medieval Iceland even treated Christian themes using the traditional repertoire of kennings complete with allusions to heathen myths and aristocratic epithets for saints: 'goddess of headdresses' = 'Saint Catherine' (K\u00e1lfr Hallsson: K\u00e1tr\u00ednardr\u00e1pa 4).\nKennings of the type AB, where B routinely has the characteristic A and thus this AB is tautological, tend to mean \"like B in that it has the characteristic A\", e.g. 'shield-Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r', tautological because the god Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r by nature has his own shield, means 'like Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r in that he has a shield', i.e. 'warrior'. A modern English example is \"painted Jezebel\" as a disapproving expression for a woman too fond of using cosmetics.\nKennings may include proper names. A modern example of this is an ad hoc usage by a helicopter ambulance pilot: \"the Heathrow of hang gliders\" for the hills behind Hawes in Yorkshire in England, when he found the air over the emergency site crowded with hang-gliders.\nSometimes a name given to one well-known member of a species is used to mean any member of that species. For example, Old Norse means 'falcon', but Old Norse mythology mentions a horse named Valr, and thus in Old Norse poetry is sometimes used to mean 'horse'.\nEllipsis.\nA term may be omitted from a well-known kenning: 'hawk-ground's valkyrie/goddess' (Haraldr Har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0i: Lausav\u00edsa 19). The full expression implied here is 'goddess of gleam/fire/adornment of ground/land/seat/perch of hawk' = 'goddess of gleam of arm' = 'goddess of gold' = 'lady' (characterised according to convention as wearing golden jewellery, the arm-kenning being a reference to falconry). The poet relies on listeners' familiarity with such conventions to carry the meaning.\nDefinitions.\nSome scholars take the term kenning broadly to include any noun-substitute consisting of two or more elements, including merely descriptive epithets (such as Old Norse 'bane of wood' = 'fire' (Snorri Sturluson: Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l 36)), while others would restrict it to metaphorical instances (such as Old Norse 'sun of the houses' = 'fire' (Snorri Sturluson: Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l 36)), specifically those where \"[t]he base-word identifies the referent with something which it is not, except in a specially conceived relation which the poet imagines between it and the sense of the limiting element'\" (Brodeur (1959) pp.\u00a0248\u2013253). Some even exclude naturalistic metaphors such as Old English 'bond of frost' = 'ice' or 'winter-raiment' = 'snow': \"A metaphor is a kenning only if it contains an incongruity between the referent and the meaning of the base-word; in the kenning the limiting word is essential to the figure because without it the incongruity would make any identification impossible\" (Brodeur (1959) pp.\u00a0248\u2013253). Descriptive epithets are a common literary device in many parts of the world, whereas kennings in this restricted sense are a distinctive feature of Old Norse and, to a lesser extent, Old English poetry.\nSnorri's own usage, however, seems to fit the looser sense: \"Snorri uses the term 'kenning' to refer to a structural device, whereby a person or object is indicated by a periphrastic description containing two or more terms (which can be a noun with one or more dependent genitives or a compound noun or a combination of these two structures)\" (Faulkes (1998 a), p. xxxiv). The term is certainly applied to non-metaphorical phrases in Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l: 'And that kenning which was written before, calling Christ the king of men, any king can have that kenning.' Likewise in H\u00e1ttatal: 'It is a kenning to call battle 'spear-crash' [...]'.\nSnorri's expression 'qualified terms' appears to be synonymous with , although Brodeur applies this more specifically to those periphrastic epithets which do not come under his strict definition of kenning.\nSverdlov approaches the question from a morphological standpoint. Noting that the modifying component in Germanic compound words can take the form of a genitive or a bare root, he points to behavioural similarities between genitive determinants and the modifying element in regular Old Norse compound words, such as the fact that neither can be modified by a free-standing (declined) adjective. According to this view, all kennings are formally compounds, notwithstanding widespread tmesis.\nOld Norse kennings in context.\nIn the following stanza, the Norwegian skald Eyvindr sk\u00e1ldaspillir (died ca. 990) compares the greed of King Harald Greycloak () to the generosity of his predecessor, Haakon the Good ():\n&lt;poem&gt;\n\u2014Eyvindr sk\u00e1ldaspillir, \"Lausav\u00edsa\"\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nA literal translation reveals several kennings: \"Ullr of the war-leek! We carried the seed of F\u00fdrisvellir on our hawk-mountains during all of Haakon's life; now the enemy of the people has hidden the flour of Fr\u00f3\u00f0i's hapless slaves in the flesh of the mother of the enemy of the giantess.\"\nThis could be paraphrased as \"O warrior, we carried gold on our arms during all of King Haakon's life; now the enemy of the people has hidden gold in the earth.\" The kennings are:\n, 'warrior', from \"Ullr\", the name of a god, and , 'sword' (literally 'war-leek'). By convention, the name of any god can be associated with another word to produce a kenning for a certain type of man; here \"Ullr of the sword\" means 'warrior'. \"War-leek\" is a kenning for 'sword' that likens the shape of the sword to that of a leek. The warrior referred to may be King Harald.\n, 'arms', from 'hawk' and 'mountain'. This is a reference to the sport of falconry, where a bird of prey is perched on the arm of the falconer. By convention, 'hawk' combined with a term for a geographic feature forms a kenning for 'arm'.\n, 'gold', from \"F\u00fdrisvellir\", the plains of the river F\u00fdri, and , 'seed'. This is an allusion to a legend retold in \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\" and \"Hr\u00f3lfs saga kraka\" in which King Hrolf and his men scattered gold on the plains () of the river F\u00fdri south of Gamla Uppsala to delay their pursuers.\n, 'flour of Fr\u00f3\u00f0i's hapless slaves', is another kenning for 'gold'. It alludes to the Grottas\u00f6ngr legend.\n, 'flesh of the mother of the enemy of the giantess', 'earth'. Here the earth is personified as the goddess J\u00f6r\u00f0, mother of Thor, enemy of the j\u01ebtnar.\nOld English and other kennings.\nThe practice of forming kennings has traditionally been seen as a common Germanic inheritance, but this has been disputed since, among the early Germanic languages, their use is largely restricted to Old Norse and Old English poetry. A possible early kenning for 'gold' ( \"Roman/Gallic grain\") is attested in the Proto-Norse runic inscription on the Tjurk\u00f6 (I)-C bracteate. Kennings are virtually absent from the surviving corpus of continental West Germanic verse; the Old Saxon Heliand contains only one example: 'body-raiment' = 'body' (Heliand 3453 b), a compound which, in any case, is normal in West Germanic and North Germanic prose (Old English , Old High German , , Dutch , Old Icelandic , , Old Swedish , Swedish , Danish and Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l , Norwegian Nynorsk ).\nOld English kennings are all of the simple type, possessing just two elements. Examples for 'sea': 'sail-road' (Beowulf 1429 b), 'swan-road' (Beowulf 200 a), 'bath-way' (Andreas 513 a), 'whale-road' (Beowulf 10), 'whale-way' (The Seafarer 63 a). Most Old English examples take the form of compound words in which the first element is uninflected: 'sky-candle' = 'the sun' (Exodus 115 b). Kennings consisting of a genitive phrase occur too, but rarely: 'heaven's gem' = 'the sun' (The Phoenix 183).\nOld English poets often place a series of synonyms in apposition, and these may include kennings (loosely or strictly defined) as well as the literal referent: ... '' (Beowulf 456).\nOld Frisian also had kennings, though they were relatively rare. In legal documents regarding the protection of children and pregnant women, the term ('fortress of the bones') is used for 'womb'.\nAlthough the word \"kenning\" is not often used for non-Germanic languages, a similar form can be found in Biblical poetry in its use of parallelism. Some examples include Genesis 49:11, in which \"blood of grapes\" is used as a kenning for 'wine', and Job 15:14, where \"born of woman\" is a parallel for 'man'.\nModern usage.\nFigures of speech similar to kennings occur in Modern English (both in literature and in regular speech), and are often found in combination with other poetic devices. For example, the Madness song \"The Sun and the Rain\" contains the line \"standing up in the falling-down\", where \"the falling-down\" refers to rain and is used in juxtaposition to \"standing up\". Some recent English writers have attempted to use approximations of kennings in their work. John Steinbeck used kenning-like figures of speech in his 1950 novella \"Burning Bright\", which was adapted into a Broadway play that same year. According to Steinbeck biographer Jay Parini, \"The experiment is well-intentioned, but it remains idiosyncratic to the point of absurdity. Steinbeck invented compound phrases (similar to the Old English use of kennings), such as 'wife-loss' and 'friend-right' and 'laughter-starving,' that simply seem eccentric.\"\nKennings remain somewhat common in German ( 'wire-donkey' for bicycle, 'fire-chair' for motorcycle, 'chamber-tiger' for cat, and so on).\nThe poet Seamus Heaney regularly employed kennings in his work; for example, \"bone-house\" for 'skeleton'.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 2018 current licensor Helmgast released the fourth edition, Kult: Divinity Lost, created by Robin Liljenberg and Petter Nallo. This edition updated the setting from the 1990s to the 2010s and was completely rewritten with new art and layout, and a ruleset based on \"Powered by the Apocalypse\". The fourth edition was well received by critics and fans and won two Ennies for Best Writing and Best Cover 2019, and was also nominated for Best Interior Art.\nSetting.\nThe default backdrop is that of our present-day large cities. Players take the roles of contemporary protagonists from across genres, such as private investigators, femmes fatales, vigilantes, drug dealers, artists, journalists, secret agents, and mad scientists. In the game, however, the entire visible world is an illusion (\"the\" Illusion) held together by a monotheistic belief which is unravelling to reveal the darker \"reality\" beneath\u2014where nightmarish monsters lurk. The Illusion was created by the Demiurge to hold humanity prisoner and to prevent us from regaining the divinity we once had. In the absence of the Demiurge, sinister forces plot to keep humanity from realizing the truth, or even to plunge the world into an apocalyptic war to restore humanity's ignorance and blind faith in the divine order.\nSome symbols and creatures appearing in \"Kult\" also appear in other Swedish games to which the same authors and production team contributed. \"The Mutant Chronicles\" universe (created by Nils Gulliksson and Michael Stenmark) and its spin-offs share creatures such as Nepharites and Razides which appear in \"Kult\".\nRules.\nThe original system is a skill-based system using a 20-sided dice (related to Chaosium's BRP system, which had already been used by \u00c4ventyrsspel for their \"Drakar och Demoner\" RPGs), with point-based characters. In the game, a natural 1 usually means a great success with added bonuses and a natural 20 means a complete failure. Normal characters usually have skill ratings of 3\u201320; to succeed in a skill roll, the player must roll equal to or lower than their skill. The lower the player rolls under their skill rating, the greater the success. Extraordinary characters and inhuman entities can have skill ratings far above the normal range.\nThe fourth edition, \"Kult: Divinity Lost\", uses rules that are based on the Apocalypse World rules engine. Players roll two 10-sided dice, add possible modifications, and try to reach at least 10 to avoid failure or 15 to gain a complete success. \"Kult: Divinity Lost\" also has a system where the Gamemaster builds the campaign around the player characters and aims to evoke personal horror.\nOver the various editions, there were several different rulesets for combat. The second and third English edition rules use a system based on Damage Effect Factors (DEF). The fourth edition, \"Kult: Divinity Lost\", has less focus on combat than previous editions.\nThe magic rules in \"Kult\" are loosely inspired by real-world occult practices, such as Hermeticism, in order to heighten the setting's realism. Sorcerers can cast spells from one (or rarely more) of five different Lores: Death, Dream, Madness, Passion and Time &amp; Space. Because these spells have (very) long casting times (up to several days); require highly specific and exacting verbal, material and somatic requirements; and can only be cast inside the sorcerer's consecrated temple, they resemble religious rituals. \nMental Balance.\nEarly editions of the game use \"Mental Balance\" as a gauge of player characters' sanity. Both a high or low (+25/-25) Mental Balance affects how normal people and animals react to the character. Characters with an extremely high or low Mental Balance can transcend the Illusion and regain their lost divine status through Awakening. This occurs if Mental Balance reaches +500 or -500.\nA character's mental balance can move in a positive or negative direction due to trauma, influence from creatures or places, or by advantages and disadvantages from talents or traits, such as (on the positive side) animal friendship, artistic talent, body awareness, a code of honor, or (on the negative side) social ineptitude, addiction, paranoia, or a mystic curse. The further the character strays away from the zero point, the more sociopathic, strange or eccentric they become. Characters with a very high or very low mental balance start to involuntarily manifest outward physical signs. \nIn the fourth edition of \"Kult\", the mental balance system was removed, as the developers found it impractical during gameplay. Instead, characters take on different archetypes in the path toward Awakening: \"The Sleeper\", \"The Aware\", and \"The Enlightened.\"\nPublication history.\n\"Kult\" was originally published in Swedish by Target Games in 1991, and was later translated into German, English, Italian, Spanish, Polish and French. American game company Metropolis Ltd. published the English-language game through its first three editions, creating new supplements with a new US background, and with revised page design and editing. Terry K. Amthor left Iron Crown Enterprises in 1992 to co-found Metropolis Ltd., specifically to produce the English-language version of the game. Between 1992 and 1994, Amthor edited, co-authored and art-directed several books for the line.\nThe third English edition of \"Kult\" had two English books released in print form: a player's handbook named \"Kult Rumours\" in 2001 and the core rulebook, \"Kult: Beyond The Veil\", printed in 2004. Other editions were published \nby 7\u00e8me Cercle (French) and Raven Distribution (Italian).\nThe license has been the property of first Target Games, then Paradox Entertainment, and, in 2015, Cabinet Holdings. \"Kult\" is currently licensed by Helmgast. A 2016 Kickstarter campaign funded the fourth edition of the game, \"Kult: Divinity Lost\". This edition uses a different rules engine than previous editions, based on \"Apocalypse World\" and its Powered by the Apocalypse rules. It updates the timeline to the modern setting. The fourth edition was released in 2018.\nSupplements.\nMany supplements have been produced in both Swedish and English. Its first supplement was \"Legions of Darkness\" in 1993. The \"Kult GM Screen\" was published in 1993, and \"Taroticum\" was published in 1994. The \"Kult Player's Companion\", \"Beyond the Boundaries\", \"Heart, Mind and Soul\", and the adventure \"The Judas Grail\" were published in 1996.\nReception.\nJeff Koke reviewed \"Kult\" for \"Pyramid\" #3 (Sept./Oct., 1993), and said, \"All in all, Kult is a very good system and background for roleplayers who are mature enough to delve into truly dark roleplaying. Even for those players who dislike being immersed in depressing, hopeless worlds, the background has enough tidbits of bleak imagery and morsels of horrific scenery that it's worth the cover price just to browse through the Metropolis.\" \nDenys Bakriges reviewed \"Kult\" in \"White Wolf\" #39 (1994), rating it a 5 out of 5 and stated that \"\"Kult\" is an excellent roleplaying game. It's one of the greatest horror games released in recent years. While its mythology is steeped in Christian ideology and Jungian philosophy, its ideas are very original. However, there's a note of 'caution.' The game setting can be unremittingly bleak and depressing. This is gut-level horror. You know what you like. Take it as you will.\"\nLucya Szachowski reviewed \"Kult: Second Edition\" for \"Arcane\" magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall, and stated that \"\"Kult\" particularly appeals to people who have become a bit jaded with Lovecraft's vision of horror and want something different. If you're a dark horror fan and you haven't already got the game, give it a go.\"\nWriting for \"Gizmodo\", Ed Grabianowski described shopping for \"Kult\" as a teenager: \"\u2009'It's banned in Sweden,' is pretty much the best possible sales pitch you can make to a couple of 14-year-old boys. And indeed \"Kult\" turns out to be a pretty interesting, intense RPG.\" Grabianoski said, \"Some of \"Kult's\" controversy stems from the inclusion of rape among the many horrors that could be experienced by a character. Like me, you may not be interested in dealing with those kinds of issues during a gaming session, but to its credit, \"Kult\" made it clear that rape had serious and terrible consequences for both the victim and the perpetrator.\" Grabianoswki concluded, \"Although \"Kult\" was never a big success in North America, it still holds that strange frisson of ominous allure.\" \nIn his 2023 book \"Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground\", RPG historian Stu Horvath said, \"The characters all harbor sordid secrets that range from enduring supernatural curses to being the subject of medical experimentation to being possessed by a demon. The secrets taint the characters and, most likely, provide the means for their eventual destruction.\"\nMoral panic in Sweden.\nSimilar to the 1980s Dungeons &amp; Dragons controversies in the United States, \"Kult\" figured in several Swedish moral panics during the 1990s. At the time of the game's initial publication, role-playing games in Sweden were still sold primarily through toy stores rather than bookstores or specialized hobby shops. \"Kult\" appeared in the press several times during the decade after its initial publication, and in 1997 the \"Kult\" core rules were quoted in a motion in the Parliament of Sweden. The motion was to stop taxpayer funding of youth groups that were active with role-playing games. It refers to the Bjuv murder, where a 15-year-old in the small southern town of Bjuv was killed by two friends, aged 16- and 17-years-old, who (according to the legal motion) were influenced by \"Kult\".\nWriter Didi \u00d6rnstedt and painter Bj\u00f6rn Sj\u00f6stedt wrote a book, \"De \u00d6vergivnas Arm\u00e9\" (\"Army of the Abandoned\"), where they warn against the role-playing game hobby, with a particular focus on \"Kult\". The title refers to children supposedly ignored by their parents and therefore assumed to be susceptible to radicalization by RPGs.\nCritics of role-playing games have also attempted to tie \"Kult\" to a 16-year-old Swedish boy who died by suicide with a shotgun in November 1996. The local newspaper \"T\u00f8nsbergs Blad\" in T\u00f8nsberg, Norway similarly attempted to link \"Kult\" to the disappearance of a boy called Andreas Hammer on July 1, 1994, who allegedly played \"Kult\" the week prior to his disappearance. He is still missing.\nFiction.\nIn 2017 Free League Publishing published Anders Fager's novel \"F\u00f6r Gudinnan\" (\"For the Love of the Goddess\") set in the \"Kult\" universe. Fager has also written a short audiobook called \"Faraday\", set in the \"Kult\" adventure \"Tarroticum\". \nIn 2018 and 2020, Free League Publishing published two novels written by the original creators of \"Kult\", Gunilla Jonsson and Michael Peters\u00e9n. They are both set in the Kult universe called \"D\u00f6den \u00e4r bara b\u00f6rjan\" (\"Death Is Only the Beginning\", 2018) and \"De levande d\u00f6da\" (\"The Living Dead\", 2020)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a renowned player of the viola da gamba, and produced significant compositions for that instrument. He was director of music at the Dresden court from 1743, and moved to London in 1759, becoming chamber-musician to Queen Charlotte in 1764. He founded a subscription concert series there with Johann Christian Bach. According to the \"Catalogue of Works of Carl Friedrich Abel\" (AbelWV), he left 420 compositions, with a focus on chamber music.\nLife.\nAbel was born in K\u00f6then, where his father, Christian Ferdinand Abel, had worked for years as the principal viola da gamba and cello player in the court orchestra of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-K\u00f6then. In 1723 Abel senior became director of the orchestra, when the previous director, Johann Sebastian Bach, moved to Leipzig. The young Abel later boarded at St. Thomas School, Leipzig, where he was taught by Bach.\nOn Bach's recommendation in 1743 he was able to join Johann Adolph Hasse's orchestra at the Dresden court, where he remained for fifteen years. In 1759 (or 1758 according to \"Chambers\"), he went to England and became chamber-musician to Queen Charlotte, in 1764. He gave a concert of his own compositions in London, performing on various instruments, one of which was a five-string cello known as a pentachord, which had been recently invented by John Joseph Merlin.\nIn 1762, Johann Christian Bach, a son of J. S. Bach, joined him in London, and the friendship between him and Abel led, in 1764 or 1765, to the establishment of the famous Bach-Abel concerts, England's first subscription concerts. In those concerts, many celebrated guest artists appeared, and many works of Haydn received their first English performance.\nFor ten years the concerts were organized by Teresa Cornelys, a retired Venetian opera singer who owned a concert hall at Carlisle House in Soho Square, then the height of fashionable events. In 1775 the concerts became independent of her, to be continued by Abel and Bach until Bach's death in 1782. Abel still remained in great demand as a player on various instruments new and old. He traveled to Germany and France between 1782 and 1785, and upon his return to London, became a leading member of the Grand Professional Concerts at the Hanover Square Rooms in Soho. Throughout his life he had enjoyed excessive living, and his drinking probably hastened his death.\nAbel died in London on 20 June 1787. He was buried in the churchyard of St Pancras Old Church.\nWorks.\nOne of Abel's works became famous due to a misattribution: in the 19th century, a manuscript symphony in the hand of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was catalogued as his Symphony No. 3 in E flat, K. 18, and was published as such in the first complete edition of Mozart's works by Breitkopf &amp; H\u00e4rtel. Later, it was discovered that this symphony was actually the work of Abel, copied by the boy Mozart, evidently for study purposes, while he was visiting London in 1764. That symphony was originally published as the concluding work in Abel's Six Symphonies, Op. 7.\nA first catalogue of Abel's works was published in 1971 by Walter Knape, \"Abel-Werkverzeichnis\", with 233 work numbers.\nIn 2015 new manuscripts of Abel's viola da gamba music were found in the library of the Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144, in a collection from the Maltzahn family palace in the town of Milicz in Poland, originally brought back from London by Count Joachim Carl of Maltzan. Many of them were published by Edition G\u00fcntersberg.\nA new catalogue, of now 420 works, was published by Ortus Musikverlag in 2023, \"Catalogue of Works of Carl Friedrich Abel\" or AbelWV, edited by G\u00fcnter von Zadow. It takes into account many newly discovered works, and additional sources for known works.\nAbel Fest.\nAs Abel was born in 1723, the city of K\u00f6then announced an international tricentennial festival around his music on four days in June 2023, held at historic locations including the palace and its gardens. It was initiated by gambist and musicologist Thomas Fritzsch. The city also created a biennial Abel Prize. The first recipients in 2023 were Leonore von Zadow-Reichling and G\u00fcnter von Zadow of Edition G\u00fcntersberg for their efforts to retrieve and publish Abel's works. They published more than 150, many as first publications.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has a strategic position located in between Sweden's main airport, the Stockholm-Arlanda International Airport and central Stockholm, and alongside the main national highway E4 economic artery. \nKista comprises residential and commercial areas, the latter in the highly technological telecommunications and information technology industry. There are large research efforts in this entire area, which therefore is dubbed Kista Science City. It is the research park of KTH Royal Institute of Technology.\nKista Science City is the location where a large portion of the research and development of the world's 4G LTE mobile telephony infrastructure is being developed, to a European ETSI standard used worldwide. A majority is done at Ericsson, with 100,000 employees worldwide, but with its research and worldwide headquarters in the Kista Science City.\nKista was named after an old farm \"Kista G\u00e5rd\", still located in the area. The construction of the modern parts were started in the 1970s. Most of the streets in Kista are named after towns and places in Denmark, Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands. Before the opening of the Mall of Scandinavia, Kista Galleria was the biggest shopping center in the Stockholm region. \nBecause of its ICT industries, it became in the 1980s referred to as \"Chipsta\" and, after Sweden joined the EU in 1995, also as Europe's \"Silicon Valley\".\nOverview.\nEtymology.\nKista got its name sometime in during 1600s and was named after a farmhouse in this area. The word Kista historically meant \"place where livestock is traded\", from the Old Swedish word \"kvi\", meaning livestock, and \"sta(d)\", meaning place.\nEconomy.\nKista is the largest corporate area in Sweden and important to the national economy.\nThe construction of the industrial section of Kista began in the 1970s with companies such as SRA (Svenska Radioaktiebolaget, now a part of Ericsson), RIFA AB (later Ericsson Components AB, and later still Ericsson Microelectronics AB, and now Infineon Technologies), and IBM Svenska AB (the Swedish branch of IBM). Ericsson has had its headquarters in Kista since 2003. Cellmax is another local company founded and headquartered in Kista.\nKista is the largest Information and Communications Technology (ICT) cluster in Europe, and was ranked the world's second largest cluster after Silicon Valley in California during the internet boom of 2000. It is the largest corporate area in Sweden, important to the national economy due to the presence of, among others, Ericsson, one of the largest corporations in Sweden.\nSafety.\nIncreasing crime rates and worsening safety has made the area much less attractive since the late 2010s. Nearly half of inhabitants report feeling unsafe and at risk of becoming a victim of a crime. In the 2020s, Kista became classified as a vulnerable area by the Swedish Police Authority.\nCompanies that used to define Kista began leaving the area after many years of violent crime incidents. Kista neighborhood has seen many incidents of robberies, stabbings, shootings, attempted murders and murders. \nSwedish branch of IBM and Ericsson, two of the biggest employers in the area, both departed in the mid-2020s. Fujitsu, Coor Service Management, KTH Royal Institute of Technology as well as other organizations also left the area. Relocations include public institutions, e.g. the local police station moved from Kista to Solna. In the mid-2020s, more than a third of office space in Kista was vacant. Various retailers have also relocated from Kista. There are several ongoing initiatives to improve safety in Kista.\nResearch and higher learning.\nKista hosts entire departments of both KTH Royal Institute of Technology, such as Wireless@KTH, and Stockholm University (formerly jointly known as \"the IT University\").\nThere are also Swedish national research institutes (pure research, no students) such as the Swedish Institute of Computer Science and Swedish Defence Research Agency, FOI who has its headquarters there, just as Ericsson, Swedish IBM and Tele 2, among others has.\nAlso the Swedish Co-location Centre of EU innovation and entrepreneurial education organisation EIT Digital is located in Kista and offers a 2-year Master program in collaboration with KTH Royal Institute of Technology.\nParks and open spaces.\nKista does not have any large and notable parks, but it has many green areas. According to statistics from Stockholm Municipality, each person in Kista has on average 94 square meters of green spaces within 500 meter radius.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It lies around the Klondike River, a small river that enters the Yukon River from the east at Dawson City. The area is merely an informal geographic region, and has no function to the territory as any kind of administrative region.\nThe Klondike is famed due to the Klondike Gold Rush, which started in 1896 and lasted until 1899. Since then, gold has been mined continuously in that area, except for a pause in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nIn 2023, the cultural landscape of the Tr'ond\u00ebk-Klondike was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, because of its testimony to the adaptation of the Tr'ond\u00ebk Hw\u00ebch'in people to the European colonization that began in the late 19th century.\nClimate and ecology.\nKlondike has a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Dfc\"), bordering on a tundra climate (K\u00f6ppen \"ET\"). The climate is warm in the short summer, and very cold during the long winter. By late October, ice forms over the rivers. For the majority of the year, the ground is frozen to a depth of . The landscape is dominated by spruce, aspen, and birch trees interspersed with riparian vegetation.\nSalmon have likely been migrating from the Pacific Ocean to the Klondike River to spawn for at least 65,000 years, and archeological evidence suggests that they have been fished as early as 11,500 years ago. Caribou also migrate through the Klondike region during their seasonal migrations. Other species found in the region include moose, black bear, grizzly bear, lynx, marten, wolf, wolverine, Dall's sheep, and beaver.\nThere is a weather station for Klondike located along the Dempster Highway, near the southern entrance of Tombstone Territorial Park, at an elevation of 973\u00a0m (3192\u00a0ft).\nPolitics.\nKlondike is a district of the Legislative Assembly of Yukon. The former Premier of the Yukon, Liberal Sandy Silver, represents the electoral district of Klondike.\nHistory.\nThe Tr'ond\u00ebk Hw\u00ebch'in people have continuously occupied the Klondike region for over 9000 years, and UNESCO has stated this was \"fundamentally transformed during the colonial occupation of these lands.\" European traders began to arrive in the region in the mid 19th century, and in 1874, the first trading post in the Klondike (Fort Reliance) was established. Soon after, in 1876, the Indian Act was passed (without Indigenous negotiation), which restricted the ability of Indigenous Canadians to continue their cultural practices and live in their original lands. This act and the discovery of precious metals in the area led to a steady increase in the arrival of colonists during the 1880s, and in 1893, the first permanent non-Indigenous settlement was founded at Ch'\u00ebd\u00e4hd\u00ebk (Forty Mile), at the site of an ancient indigenous hunting spot. When gold was discovered nearby in 1896, several boomtowns were founded and the landscape around the Klondike transformed into an industrial hub. Nearly 30,000 people arrived in Dawson City over the next few years. In mid-1901 an expedition left California hoping to prove that the Klondike was the site of the Biblical Garden of Eden. It was sponsored ($50,000) by Morris Ketchum Jesup with an American naturalist (Norman Buxton) and two Russian scientists (Waldemar Bogoras and Waldemar Jochelson). The Tr'ond\u00ebk Hw\u00ebch'in were forced to relocate downriver to an ancestral camp called Moosehide, where it became the center of the Indigenous community until the 1950s.\nAfter the Klondike Gold Rush ended near the turn of the 20th century, many of the boomtowns quickly became ghost towns, but Dawson City remained the capital of the Yukon until 1953 (when the capital was moved to Whitehorse).\nTr'ond\u00ebk-Klondike World Heritage Site.\nSeveral archaeological sites in the Klondike were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2023 as a cultural landscape, described as follows: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Located along the Yukon River in the sub-arctic region of Northwest Canada, Tr'ond\u00ebk-Klondike lies within the homeland of the Tr'ond\u00ebk Hw\u00ebch'in First Nation. It contains archaeological and historic sources that reflect Indigenous people's adaptation to unprecedented changes caused by the Klondike Gold Rush at the end of the 19th century. The series illustrates different aspects of the colonization of this area, including sites of exchange between the Indigenous population and the colonists, and sites demonstrating the Tr'ond\u00ebk Hw\u00ebch'in's adaptations to colonial presence.The site contains eight subsites:\nThese sites show archaeological evidence of the transition from Indigenous to European land use, and the interactions between the two cultures.

{"id": "16793", "revid": "1839637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16793", "title": "Korean cuisine", "text": "Korean cuisine is the set of foods and culinary styles which are associated with Korean culture. This cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in Korea and southern Manchuria, Korean cuisine reflects a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends.\nKorean cuisine is largely based on rice, vegetables, seafood and (at least in South Korea) meats. Dairy is largely absent from the traditional Korean diet. Traditional Korean meals are named for the number of side dishes () that accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Kimchi is served at nearly every meal. Commonly used ingredients include sesame oil, (fermented bean paste), soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, (pepper flakes), (fermented red chili paste) and napa cabbage.\nIngredients and dishes vary by province. Many regional dishes have become national. Korean royal court cuisine once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Foods are regulated by Korean cultural etiquette.\nKimjang, which refers to the process of making kimchi, is listed on the UNESCO Intangible Heritage List.\nHistory.\nPrehistoric.\nIn the Jeulmun pottery period (approximately 8000 to 1500 BCE), hunter-gatherer societies engaged in fishing and hunting, and incipient agriculture in the later stages. Since the beginning of the Mumun pottery period (1500 BCE), agricultural traditions began to develop with new migrant groups from the Liao River basin of Manchuria. During the Mumun period, people grew millet, barley, wheat, legumes and rice, and continued to hunt and fish. Archaeological remains point to development of fermented beans during this period, and cultural contact with nomadic cultures to the north facilitated domestication of animals.\nThree Kingdoms period.\nThe Three Kingdoms period (57 BCE\u00a0\u2013 668 CE) was one of rapid cultural evolution. The kingdom of Goguryeo (37 BCE\u00a0\u2013 668 CE) was located in the northern part of the peninsula along much of modern-day Manchuria. The second kingdom, Baekje (18 BCE\u00a0\u2013 660 CE), was in the southwestern portion of the peninsula, and the third, Silla (57 BCE\u00a0\u2013 935 CE), was located at the southeastern portion of the peninsula. Each region had its own distinct set of cultural practices and foods. For example, Baekje was known for cold foods and fermented foods like \"kimchi\". The spread of Buddhism and Confucianism through cultural exchanges with China during the fourth century CE began to change the distinct cultures of Korea.\nAttributed with the earliest kimchi, the Goguryeo people were skilled at fermenting and widely consumed fermented food.\nGoryeo period.\nDuring the latter Goryeo period, the Mongols invaded Goryeo in the 13th century. Some traditional foods found today in Korea have their origins during this period. The dumpling dish, \"mandu\", grilled meat dishes, noodle dishes, and the use of seasonings such as black pepper, all have their roots in this period.\nJoseon period.\nAgricultural innovations were significant and widespread during this period, such as the invention of the rain gauge during the 15th century. During 1429, the government began publishing books on agriculture and farming techniques, which included \"Nongsa chiks\u014fl\" (literally \"Straight Talk on Farming\"), an agricultural book compiled under King Sejong.\nA series of invasions in the earlier half of the Joseon caused a dynamic shift in the culture during the second half of the period. Groups of \"silhak\" (\"practical learning\") scholars began to emphasize the importance of looking outside the country for innovation and technology to help improve the agricultural systems. Crops traded by Europeans from the New World began to appear, acquired through trade with China, Japan, Europe, and the Philippines; these crops included maize, sweet potatoes, chili peppers, tomatoes, peanuts, and squash. Potatoes and sweet potatoes were particularly favored as they grew in soils and on terrains that were previously unused.\nGovernment further developed agriculture through technology and lower taxation. Complex irrigation systems built by government allowed peasant farmers to produce larger crop volumes and produce crops not only for sustenance but also as cash crops. Reduced taxation of the peasantry also furthered the expanded commerce through increasing periodic markets, usually held every five days. One thousand such markets existed in the 19th century, and were communal centers for economic trade and entertainment.\nThe end of the Joseon period was marked by consistent encouragement to trade with the Western world, China and Japan. In the 1860s, trade agreements pushed by the Japanese government led the Joseon dynasty to open its trade ports with the west, and to numerous treaties with the United States, Britain, France, and other Western countries.\nThe opening of Korea to the Western world brought further exchange of culture and food. Western missionaries introduced new ingredients and dishes to Korea. Joseon elites were introduced to these new foods by way of foreigners who attended the royal court as advisers or physicians. This period also saw the introduction of various seasonings imported from Japan via western traders and alcoholic drinks from China.\nColonial period to modern period.\nJapan occupied the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945. Many of its agricultural systems were taken over by the Japanese to support Japan's food supply. Land changes resulting from the Japanese occupation included combining small farms into large-scale farms, which led to larger yields. Rice production increased during this period to support the Empire of Japan's war efforts. Many Koreans, in turn, increased the production of other grains for their own consumption.\nMeals during the Japanese occupation were quite varied. Koreans usually ate two meals a day during the cold seasons, and three during the warm seasons. For the lower classes, satiety, rather than quality, was most important. Those in even lower economic levels were likely to enjoy only a single bowl of white rice each year, while the remainder of the year's meals consisted of cheaper grains, such as millet and barley. For the Korean middle and upper classes during the occupation, things were quite different. Western foods began emerging in the Korean diet, such as white bread and commercially produced staples such as precooked noodles. The Japanese occupational period ended after the defeat of Japan during World War II.\nThe country remained in a state of turmoil through the Korean War (1950\u20131953) and the Cold War, which separated the country into North Korea and South Korea. Both of these periods continued the limited food provisions for Koreans, and the stew called \"budae jjigae\", which makes use of inexpensive meats such as sausage and Spam, originated during this period.\nAt this point, the history of North and South Korea sharply diverged. In the 1960s under President Park Chung Hee, industrialization began to give South Korea the economic and cultural power it holds in the global economy today. Agriculture was increased through use of commercial fertilizers and modern farming equipment. In the 1970s, food shortages began to lessen. Consumption of instant and processed foods increased, as did the overall quality of foods. Livestock and dairy production was increased during the 1970s through the increase of commercial dairies and mechanized farms. The consumption of pork and beef increased vastly in the 1970s. Per-capita consumption of meat was 3.6\u00a0kg in 1961 and 11\u00a0kg by 1979. The result of this increased meat consumption brought about the rise of \"bulgogi\" restaurants, which gave the middle class of South Korea the ability to enjoy meat regularly. Meat eating continued to rise, reaching 40\u00a0kg in 1997, with fish consumption at 49.5\u00a0kg in 1998. Rice consumption continually decreased through these years, from 128\u00a0kg consumed per person in 1985 to 106\u00a0kg in 1995 and 83\u00a0kg in 2003. The decrease in rice consumption has been accompanied by an increase in the consumption of bread and noodles. In 2009, the South Korean government launched a $77-million culinary diplomacy program called \"Korean Cuisine to the World\" to promote its cuisine and subsequently pivoted into the markets in the United States and Muslim countries.\nFood.\nGrains.\nGrains have been one of the most important staples of the Korean diet. Early myths of the foundations of various kingdoms in Korea center on grains. One foundation myth relates to Jumong, who received barley seeds from two doves sent by his mother after establishing the kingdom of Goguryeo. Yet another myth speaks of the three founding deities of Jeju Island, who were to be wed to the three princesses of Tamna; the deities brought seeds of five grains which were the first seeds planted, which in turn became the first instance of farming.\nDuring the pre-modern era, grains such as barley and millet were the main staples. They were supplemented by wheat, sorghum, and buckwheat. Rice is not an indigenous crop to Korea and millet was likely the preferred grain before rice was cultivated. Rice became the grain of choice during the Three Kingdoms period, particularly in the Silla and Baekje Kingdoms in the southern regions of the peninsula. Rice was such an important commodity in Silla that it was used to pay taxes. The Sino-Korean word for \"tax\" is a compound character that uses the character for the rice plant. The preference for rice escalated into the Joseon period, when new methods of cultivation and new varieties emerged that would help increase production.\nAs rice was prohibitively expensive when it first came to Korea, the grain was likely mixed with other grains to \"stretch\" the rice; this is still done in dishes such as \"boribap\" (rice with barley) and \"kongbap\" (rice with beans). White rice, which is rice with the bran removed, has been the preferred form of rice since its introduction into the cuisine. The most traditional method of cooking the rice has been to cook it in an iron pot called a \"sot\" () or \"musoe sot\" (). This method of rice cookery dates back to at least the Goryeo period, and these pots have even been found in tombs from the Silla period. The \"sot\" is still used today, much in the same manner as it was in the past centuries.\nRice is used to make a number of items, outside of the traditional bowl of plain white rice. It is commonly ground into a flour and used to make rice cakes called \"tteok\" in over two hundred varieties. It is also cooked down into a congee (\"juk\") or gruel (\"mieum\") and mixed with other grains, meat, or seafood. Koreans also produce a number of rice wines, both in filtered and unfiltered versions. Grains have also been used for centuries to make misu and misu-garu, drinks made from grain powder that are sometimes used as meal supplements.\nFruits.\nEncompassing a wide range of temperate climates, the Korean peninsula supports the growth of many cultivated and wild fruit species. Asian pears of numerous varieties, persimmons, apples, citrus, melons, berries and more are typical of summer and fall produce. Asian pears and persimmons, being Pre-Columbian era staples, are particularly well-represented in culture as gifts, ceremonies, medicine, marinades, and subjects of art and poetry.\nLegumes.\nLegumes have been significant crops in Korean history and cuisine, according to the earliest preserved legumes found in archaeological sites in Korea. The excavation at Okbang site, Jinju, South Gyeongsang Province indicates soybeans were cultivated as a food crop circa 1000\u2013900 BCE. They are still made into dubu (tofu), while soybean sprouts are sauteed as a vegetable (\"kongnamul\") and whole soybeans are seasoned and served as a side dish. They are also made into soy milk, which is used as the base for the noodle dish called \"kongguksu\". A byproduct of soy milk production is \"biji\" or \"kong-biji\", which is served as a stew and also used to thicken stews and porridges. Soybeans may also be one of the beans in \"kongbap\", boiled together with several types of beans and other grains, and they are also the primary ingredient in the production of fermented condiments collectively referred to as \"jang\", such as soybean pastes, \"doenjang\" and \"cheonggukjang\", a soy sauce called \"ganjang\", chili pepper paste or \"gochujang\" and others.\nNokdu (Mung bean) is commonly used in Korean cuisine. \"Sukju namuls (Mung bean sprouts)\" are often served as a side dish, blanched and saut\u00e9ed with sesame oil, garlic, and salt. Ground Nokdu is used to make a porridge called \"nokdujuk\", which is eaten as a nutritional supplement and digestive aid, especially for ill patients. A popular snack, \"bindaetteok\" (mung bean pancake), is made with ground nokdu and fresh sukju namul. Starch extracted from ground nokdu is used to make transparent dangmyeon ( cellophane noodles). The dangmyeons are the main ingredients for \"japchae\" (a salad-like dish) and \"sundae\" (a blood sausage), and are a subsidiary ingredient for soups and stews. The starch can be also used to make jelly-like foods, such as \"nokdumuk\" and \"hwangpomuk\". The \"muk\" have a bland flavor, so are served seasoned with soy sauce, sesame oil and crumbled seaweed or other seasonings such as \"tangpyeongchae\".\nCultivation of azuki beans dates back to ancient times according to an excavation from Odong-ri, Hoeryong, North Hamgyong Province, which is assumed to be that of Mumun period (approximately 1500\u2013300 BCE). Azuki beans are generally eaten as \"patbap\", which is a bowl of rice mixed with the beans, or as a filling and covering for \"tteok\" (rice cake) and breads. A porridge made with azuki beans, called \"patjuk\", is commonly eaten during the winter season. On Dongjinal, a Korean traditional holiday which falls on 22 December, Korean people eat \"donji patjuk\", which contains \"saealsim\" (), a ball made from glutinous rice flour. In old Korean tradition, \"patjuk\" is believed to have the power to drive evil spirits away.\nCondiments and seasoning.\nCondiments are divided into fermented and nonfermented variants. Fermented condiments include \"ganjang\", \"doenjang\", \"gochujang\" and vinegars. Nonfermented condiments or spices include red pepper, black pepper, cordifolia, mustard, chinensis, garlic, onion, ginger, leek, and scallion (spring onion).\nGochujang.\nGochujang can be found in many writings. Some of the writings are the \"Mangi Yoram\", \"The Three States\", the \"Nonggawolryeongga\", the \"Gijaejapgi\", and the \"Hyangyak-jipsongbang\". The \"Hyangyak-jipseongbang\", which dates back to around 1433 during the Chosun dynasty, is one of the oldest writings mentioning gochujang.\nGochujang is a fermented bean paste made with red pepper powder, fermented soybean powder (Meju) and rice flour. It typically can be added to most dishes. Gochujang can be used as a seasoning and sometimes as a dipping sauce. The taste is described as savory, peppery, salty, spicy and slightly sweet.\nMany variations come from \"jang\", fermented bean paste. Some variations can include doenjang (soybean and brine), kanjang (soybeans, water, and salt), chogochujang (gochujang and vinegar), and jeotgal (mixture of other jangs and seafoods).\nVegetables such as cucumbers, carrots, and cabbage use gochujang as a dip. Gochujang is a common seasoning for foods such as Korean barbecue including pork and beef. One popular snack food that is very commonly eaten with gochujang is bibimbap. Bibimbap includes rice, spinach, radish, bean sprouts. Sometimes beef is added to bibimbap. Another popular dish including gochujang is tteokbokki.\nGochujang was believed to revitalize people who were sick with colds or exhaustion during the Gio period. There have been some studies that show that red peppers fight obesity and diabetes. Gochujang is also added to many foods so that there can be additional nutritional value with each meal.\nMeat.\nIn antiquity, most meat in Korea was likely obtained through hunting and fishing. Ancient records indicate rearing of livestock began on a small scale during the Three Kingdoms period. Meat was consumed roasted or in soups or stews during this period. Those who lived closer to the oceans were able to complement their diet with more fish, while those who lived in the interior had a diet containing more meat.\nBeef.\nBeef is the most prized of all, with cattle holding an important cultural role in the Korean home. Beef is prepared in numerous ways today, including roasting, grilling (\"gui\") or boiling in soups. Beef can also be dried into \"yukpo\", a type of \"po\", as with seafood, called \"eopo\".\nThe cattle were valuable draught animals, often seen as equal to human servants, or in some cases, members of the family. Cattle were also given their own holiday during the first \"cow\" day of the lunar New Year. The importance of cattle does not suggest Koreans ate an abundance of beef, however, as the cattle were valued as beasts of burden and slaughtering one would create dire issues in farming the land. Pork and seafood were consumed more regularly for this reason. The Buddhist ruling class of the Goryeo period forbade the consumption of beef. The Mongols dispensed with the ban of beef during the 13th century, and they promoted the production of beef cattle. This increased production continued into the Joseon period, when the government encouraged both increased quantities and quality of beef. Only in the latter part of the 20th century has beef become regular table fare.\nChicken.\nChicken has played an important role as a protein in Korean history, evidenced by a number of myths. One myth tells of the birth of Kim Alji, founder of the Kim family of Gyeongju being announced by the cry of a white chicken. As the birth of a clan's founder is always announced by an animal with preternatural qualities, this myth speaks to the importance of chicken in Korean culture. Chicken is often served roasted or braised with vegetables or in soups. All parts of the chicken are used in Korean cuisine, including the gizzard, liver, and feet. Young chickens are braised with ginseng and other ingredients in medicinal soups eaten during the summer months to combat heat called \"samgyetang\". The feet of the chicken, called \"dakbal\" (), are often roasted and covered with hot and spicy \"gochujang\"-based sauce and served as an \"anju\", or side dish, to accompany alcoholic beverages, especially \"soju\".\nPork.\nPork has also been another important land-based protein for Korea. Records indicate pork has been a part of the Korean diet back to antiquity, similar to beef.\nA number of foods have been avoided while eating pork, including Chinese bellflower (\"doraji\", \ub3c4\ub77c\uc9c0) and lotus root (\"yeonn ppuri\", \uc5f0\ubfcc\ub9ac), as the combinations have been thought to cause diarrhea. All parts of the pig are used in Korean cuisine, including the head, intestines, liver, kidney and other internal organs. Koreans utilize these parts in a variety of cooking methods including steaming, stewing, boiling and smoking. Koreans especially like to eat grilled pork belly, which is called \"samgyeopsal\".\nFish and seafood.\nFish and shellfish have been a major part of Korean cuisine because of the oceans bordering the peninsula. Evidence from the 12th century illustrates commoners consumed a diet mostly of fish and shellfish, such as shrimp, clams, oysters, abalone, and loach, while sheep and hogs were reserved for the upper class.\nBoth fresh and saltwater fish are popular, and are served raw, grilled, broiled, dried or served in soups and stews. Common grilled fish include mackerel, hairtail, croaker and Pacific herring. Smaller fish, shrimp, squid, mollusks and countless other seafood can be salted and fermented as \"jeotgal\". Fish can also be grilled either whole or in fillets as banchan. Fish is often dried naturally to prolong storing periods and enable shipping over long distances. Fish commonly dried include yellow corvina, anchovies (\"myeolchi\") and croaker. Dried anchovies, along with kelp, form the basis of common soup stocks.\nShellfish is widely eaten in all different types of preparation. They can be used to prepare broth, eaten raw with \"chogochujang\", which is a mixture of \"gochujang\" and vinegar, or used as a popular ingredient in countless dishes. Raw oysters and other seafood can be used in making kimchi to improve and vary the flavor. Salted baby shrimp are used as a seasoning agent, known as \"saeujeot\", for the preparation of some types of kimchi. Large shrimp are often grilled as \"daeha gui\" () or dried, mixed with vegetables and served with rice. Mollusks eaten in Korean cuisine include octopus, cuttlefish, and squid.\nVegetables.\nKorean cuisine uses a wide variety of vegetables, which are often served uncooked, either in salads or pickles, as well as cooked in various stews, stir-fried dishes, and other hot dishes. Commonly used vegetables include Korean radish, napa cabbage, cucumber, potato, sweet potato, spinach, bean sprouts, scallions, garlic, chili peppers, seaweed, zucchini, mushrooms, lotus root. Several types of wild greens, known collectively as \"chwinamul\" (such as \"Aster scaber\"), are a popular dish, and other wild vegetables such as bracken fern shoots (\"gosari\") or Korean bellflower root (\"doraji\") are also harvested and eaten in season. Traditional medicinal herbs in Korean cuisine, such as ginseng, lingzhi mushroom, wolfberry, \"Codonopsis pilosula\", and \"Angelica sinensis\", are often used as ingredients in cooking, as in \"samgyetang\".\nMedicinal foods.\nMedicinal food (\"boyangshik\") is a wide variety of specialty foods prepared and eaten for their purported medicinal purposes, especially during the hottest 30-day period in the lunar calendar, called \"sambok\". Hot foods consumed are believed to restore \"ki\", as well as sexual and physical stamina lost in the summer heat. Commonly eaten \"boyangshik\" include ginseng, chicken, black goat, abalone, eel, carp, beef bone soups, pig kidneys.\nSamgyetang.\n\"Samgyetang\" is a chicken ginseng soup traditionally consumed during Boknal () days: the hottest days of summer. It is a Korean custom to eat hot food in hot weather called Iyeolchiyeol (), which means \"controlling heat with heat\". Consequently, Samgyetang is Koreans' favorite energizing food and it is common to have it on sambok () days\u2014Chobok (), Jungbok () and Malbok ()\u2014which are believed to be the hottest days in Korea.\nDishes.\nKorean foods can be largely categorized into groups of \"main staple foods\" (), \"subsidiary dishes\" (), and \"dessert\" (). The main dishes are made from grains such as \"bap\" (a bowl of rice), \"juk\" (porridge), and \"guksu\" (noodles).\nMany Korean \"banchan\" rely on fermentation for flavor and preservation, resulting in a tangy, salty, and spicy taste. Certain regions are especially associated with some dishes (for example, the city of Jeonju with \"bibimbap\") either as a place of origin or for a famous regional variety. Restaurants will often use these famous names on their signs or menus (e.g. \"Suwon galbi\").\nSoups and stews.\nSoups are a common part of any Korean meal. Unlike other cultures, in Korean culture, soup is served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal, as an accompaniment to rice along with other banchan. Soups known as \"guk\" are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Soups can be made into more formal soups known as \"tang\", often served as the main dish of the meal. \"Jjigae\" are a thicker, heavier seasoned soups or stews.\nSome popular types of soups are:\nStews are referred to as \"jjigae\", and are often a shared side dish. \"Jjigae\" is often both cooked and served in the glazed earthenware pot (\"ttukbaegi\") in which it is cooked. The most common version of this stew is \"doenjang jjigae\", which is a stew of soybean paste, with many variations; common ingredients include vegetables, saltwater or freshwater fish, and tofu. The stew often changes with the seasons and which ingredients are available. Other common varieties of \"jjigae\" contain kimchi (\"kimchi jjigae\") or tofu (\"sundubu jjigae\").\nKimchi.\nKimchi refers to often fermented vegetable dishes, usually made with napa cabbage, Korean radish, or sometimes cucumber. There are 4 types of raw materials which are major ones: spices, seasonings, and other additional materials. Red and black pepper, cinnamon, garlic, ginger, onion, and mustard are the example of spices. There are endless varieties with regional variations, and it is served as a side dish or cooked into soups and rice dishes. In the late 15th century, it depicted Korean's custom that Korean ancestors buried kimchi jars in the ground for storage for the entire winter season, as fermented foods can keep for several years. These were stored in traditional Korean mud pots known as jangdokdae, although with the advent of refrigerators, special kimchi freezers and commercially produced kimchi, this practice has become less common. Kimchi is a vegetable-based food which includes low calorie, low fat, and no cholesterol. Also, it is a rich source of various vitamins and minerals. It contains vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, and vitamin K and minerals which are calcium, iron, phosphorus, and selenium. The same lactobacilli bacteria found in yogurt and other fermented dairy products are also found in kimchi. In 2021, Koreans collectively consumed 1,965,000 tons of Kimchi, with average Korean consuming 88.3 grams of Kimchi daily.\nNoodles.\nNoodles or noodle dishes in Korean cuisine are collectively referred to as \"guksu\" in native Korean or \"myeon\" in hanja. While noodles were eaten in Korea from ancient times, productions of wheat was less than other crops, so wheat noodles did not become a daily food until 1945. Wheat noodles (\"milguksu\") were specialty foods for birthdays, weddings or auspicious occasions because the long and continued shape were thought to be associated with the bliss for longevity and long-lasting marriage.\nIn Korean traditional noodle dishes are \"onmyeon\" or \"guksu jangguk\" (noodles with a hot clear broth), \"naengmyeon\" (cold buckwheat noodles), \"bibim guksu\" (cold noodle dish mixed with vegetables), \"kalguksu\" (knife-cut noodles), \"kongguksu\" (noodles with a cold soybean broth), \"japchae\" (cellophane noodles made from sweet potato with various vegetables) and others. In royal court, \"baekmyeon\" (literally \"white noodles\") consisting of buckwheat noodles and pheasant broth, was regarded as the top quality noodle dish. \"Naengmyeon\" with a cold soup mixed with \"dongchimi\" (watery radish kimchi) and beef brisket broth was eaten in court during summer.\nBanchan.\nBanchan is a term referring collectively to side dishes in Korean cuisine. Soups and stews are not considered banchan.\n\"Gui\" are grilled dishes, which most commonly have meat or fish as their primary ingredient, but may in some cases also comprise grilled vegetables or other vegetable ingredients. At traditional restaurants, meats are cooked at the center of the table over a charcoal grill, surrounded by various \"banchan\" and individual rice bowls. The cooked meat is then cut into small pieces and wrapped with fresh lettuce leaves, with rice, thinly sliced garlic, \"ssamjang\" (a mixture of \"gochujang\" and \"dwenjang\"), and other seasonings. The suffix \"gui\" is often omitted in the names of meat-based \"gui\" such as \"galbi\", the name of which was originally \"galbi gui\".\n\"Jjim\" and \"seon\" (steamed dishes) are generic terms referring to steamed or boiled dishes in Korean cuisine. However, the former is made with meat or seafood-based ingredients marinated in \"gochujang\" or \"ganjang\" while \"seon\" is made with vegetable stuffed with fillings.\n\"Hoe\" (raw dishes): although the term originally referred to any kind of raw dish, it is generally used to refer to \"saengseonhweh\" (\uc0dd\uc120\ud68c, raw fish dishes). It is dipped in \"gochujang\", or soy sauce with wasabi, and served with lettuce or perilla leaves.\n\"Jeon\" (or \"buchimgae\") is a Korean savory pancake made from various ingredients. Chopped kimchi or seafood is mixed into a wheat flour-based batter, and then pan fried. This dish is typically dipped in a mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, and red pepper powder. It can be served as an appetizer, side dish (\"banchan\") or accompanied by alcohol (\"anju\").\nThere are some sweet varieties called Hwajeon () which means flower pancakes.\nCooking oils such as soy and corn are used today, though technology required for producing these oils was not available during the Joseon dynasty.\n\"Namul\" may refer to either \"saengchae\" (\uc0dd\ucc44, literally \"fresh vegetables\") or \"sukchae\" (\uc219\ucc44, literally \"heated vegetables\"), although the term generally indicates the latter. \"Saengchae\" is mostly seasoned with vinegar, chili pepper powder and salt to give a tangy and refreshing taste. On the other hand, \"sukchae\" () is blanched and seasoned with soy sauce, sesame oil, chopped garlic, or sometimes chili pepper powder.\n\"Anju\" (side dishes accompanying alcoholic beverages).\n\"Anju\" is a general term for a Korean side dish consumed with alcohol. It matches well with Korean traditional alcohol such as Soju or Makgeolli and helps people to enjoy their drinking more. Some examples of \"anju\" include steamed squid with \"gochujang\", assorted fruit, \"dubu kimchi\" (tofu with kimchi), peanuts, \"odeng\"/\"ohmuk\", \"sora\" () (a kind of shellfish popular in street food tents), and \"nakji\" (small octopus) and Jokbal (pig's leg served with salted shrimp sauce). Samgyupsal (pork belly) is also considered \"anju\" with Soju. Most Korean foods can be considered \"anju\", as the food consumed alongside the alcohol depends on the diner's taste and preferences.\nHoliday food.\n\"Songpyeon\".\n\"Songpyeon\" is a Korean dish made of rice powder mostly eaten during Chuseok to express gratitude towards ancestors. Songpyeon recordings appear from the 17th century. It is said in \u300eYorok \u8981 \u9304\u300f, \"Make rice cakes with white rice flour, steam them with pine and pine needles and wash them off with water.\" At the beginning of Songpyeon, rice cakes were made simply with white rice powder, pine needles were steamed and then washed in water. It is said that \"red beans, pine nuts, walnuts, ginger and cinnamon\" were added in the \"Buyin Pilji \u5a66\u4eba \u5fc5 \u77e5\". In \u300eKorean Rice Cakes, Hangwa, Eumcheongryu\u300f, \"In mountainous regions such as Gangwon-do and Chungcheong-do, potato songpyeon, acorn songpyeon and songgisongpyeon have been prepared and eaten. In the coastal areas of Hamgyeong-do, Pyeongan-do and Gyeonggi-do, shellfish songpyeon as produced and eaten, and in the southern regions of Jeolla-do and Gyeongsang-do, songpyeon with moss leaves was produced and eaten.\"\n\"Ogok-bap\".\n\"Ogok-bap\" means five rice dish, which consists of rice mixed with glutinous rice, cornstarch, red bean, perilla, and soybean. By consuming grains with the energy of blue, red, yellow, white, and black, Koreans pray for good health as well as a good year for our body with the energy of the five elements, and to chase away bad luck and happiness and well-being.\nBeverages.\nNon-alcoholic beverages.\nAll Korean traditional nonalcoholic beverages are referred to as \"eumcheong\" or \"eumcheongnyu\" (\uc74c\uccad\ub958 \u98ee\u6df8\u985e) which literally means \"clear beverages\". According to historical documents regarding Korean cuisine, 193 items of \"eumcheongnyu\" are recorded. \"Eumcheongnyu\" can be divided into the following categories: \"tea\", \"hwachae\" (fruit punch), \"sikhye\" (sweet rice drink), \"sujeonggwa\" (persimmon punch), \"tang\" (\ud0d5, boiled water), \"jang\" (\uc7a5, fermented grain juice with a sour taste), \"suksu\" (\uc219\uc218, beverage made of herbs), \"galsu\" (\uac08\uc218, drink made of fruit extract, and Oriental medicine), honeyed water, juice and milk by their ingredient materials and preparation methods. Among the varieties, tea, \"hwachae\", \"sikhye\", and \"sujeonggwa\" are still widely favored and consumed; however, the others almost disappeared by the end of the 20th century.\nIn Korean cuisine, tea, or \"cha\", refers to various types of herbal tea that can be served hot or cold. Not necessarily related to the leaves, leaf buds, and internodes of the \"Camellia sinensis\" plant, they are made from diverse substances, including fruits (e.g. \"yuja-cha\"), flowers (e.g. \"gukhwa-cha\"), leaves, roots, and grains (e.g. \"bori-cha\", \"hyeonmi-cha\") or herbs and substances used in traditional Korean medicine, such as ginseng (e.g. \"insam-cha\") and ginger (e.g. \"saenggang-cha\").\nAlcoholic beverages.\nWhile \"soju\" is the best known liquor, there are well over 100 different alcoholic beverages, such as beers, rice and fruit wines, and liquors produced in South Korea as well as a sweet rice drink. The top-selling domestic beers (\"maekju\" in Korean) are lagers, which differ from Western beers in that they are brewed from rice, rather than barley. Consequently, Korean beers are lighter, sweeter and have less head than their Western counterparts. The South Korean beer market is dominated by the two major breweries: Hite and OB. Taedonggang is a North Korean beer produced at a brewery based in Pyongyang since 2002. Microbrewery beers and bars are growing in popularity after 2002.\n\"Soju\" is a clear spirit which was originally made from grain, especially rice, and is now also made from sweet potatoes or barley. \"Soju\" made from grain is considered superior (as is also the case with grain vs. potato vodka). \"Soju\" is around 22% ABV, and is a favorite beverage of hard-up college students, hard-drinking businessmen, and blue-collar workers.\n\"Yakju\" is a refined pure liquor fermented from rice, with the best known being \"cheongju\". \"Takju\" is a thick unrefined liquor made with grains, with the best known being \"makgeolli\", a white, milky rice wine traditionally drunk by farmers.\nIn addition to the rice wine, various fruit wines and herbal wines exist in Korean cuisine. Acacia, \"maesil\" plum, Chinese quince, cherry, pine cone, and pomegranate are most popular. \"Majuang wine\" (a blended wine of Korean grapes with French or American wines) and ginseng-based wines are also available.\nSweets.\nTraditional rice cakes, \"tteok\" and Korean confectionery \"hangwa\" are eaten as treats during holidays and festivals. \"Tteok\" refers to all kinds of rice cakes made from either pounded rice (\uba54\ub5a1, \"metteok\"), pounded glutinous rice (\ucc30\ub5a1, \"chaltteok\"), or glutinous rice left whole, without pounding. It is served either filled or covered with sweetened mung bean paste, red bean paste, mashed red beans, raisins, a sweetened filling made with sesame seeds, sweet pumpkin, beans, jujubes, pine nuts or honey). \"Tteok\" is usually served as dessert or as a snack. Among varieties, \"songpyeon\" is a chewy stuffed \"tteok\" served at \"Chuseok\". Honey or another soft sweet material such as sweetened sesame or black beans are used as fillings. Pine needles can be used for imparting flavor during the steaming process. \"Yaksik\" is a sweet rice cake made with glutinous rice, chestnuts, pine nuts, jujubes, and other ingredients, while \"chapssaltteok\" is a \"tteok\" filled with sweet bean paste.\nOn the other hand, \"hangwa\" is a general term referring to all types of Korean traditional confectionery. The ingredients of \"hahngwa\" mainly consist of grain flour, honey, \"yeot\", and sugar, or of fruit and edible roots. \"Hangwa\" is largely divided into \"yumilgwa\" (fried confectionery), \"suksilgwa\", \"jeonggwa\", \"gwapyeon\", \"dasik\" (tea food) and \"yeot\". \"Yumilgwa\" is made by stir frying or frying pieces of dough, such as \"maejakgwa\" and \"yakgwa\". \"Maejakgwa\" is a ring-shaped confection made of wheat flour, vegetable oil, cinnamon, ginger juice, \"jocheong\", and pine nuts, while \"yakgwa\", literally \"medicinal confectionery\", is a flower-shaped biscuit made of honey, sesame oil and wheat flour.\n\"Suksilgwa\" is made by boiling fruits, ginger, or nuts in water, and then forming the mix into the original fruit's shape, or other shapes. \"Gwapyeon\" is a jelly-like confection made by boiling sour fruits, starch, and sugar. \"Dasik\", literally \"eatery for tea\", is made by kneading rice flour, honey, and various types of flour from nuts, herbs, sesame, or jujubes. \"Jeonggwa\", or \"jeongwa\", is made by boiling fruits, plant roots and seeds in honey, mullyeot (\"\ubb3c\uc5ff\", liquid candy) or sugar. It is similar to marmalade or jam/jelly. \"Yeot\" is a Korean traditional candy in liquid or solid form made from steamed rice, glutinous rice, glutinous kaoliang, corn, sweet potatoes or mixed grains. The steamed ingredients are lightly fermented and boiled in a large pot called \"sot\" () for a long time.\n\"Yugwa\" and Yakgwa. They are traditional desserts enjoyed during Chuseok, marriage or the sixtieth birthday.\nRegional and variant cuisines.\nKorean regional cuisines () are characterized by local specialties and distinctive styles within Korean cuisine. The divisions reflected historical boundaries of the provinces where these food and culinary traditions were preserved until modern times.\nAlthough Korea has been divided into two nation-states since 1948 (North Korea and South Korea), it was once divided into eight provinces (\"paldo\") according to the Joseon administrative districts. The northern region consisted of Hamgyeong Province, Pyeongan Province and Hwanghae Province. The central region comprised Gyeonggi Province, Chungcheong Province, and Gangwon Province. Gyeongsang Province and Jeolla Province made up the southern region.\nUntil the late 19th century, transportation networks were not well developed, and each provincial region preserved its own characteristic tastes and cooking methods. Geographic differences are also reflected by the local specialty foodstuffs depending on the climate and types of agriculture, as well as the natural foods available. With the modern development of transportation and the introduction of foreign foods, Korean regional cuisines have tended to overlap and integrate. However, many unique traditional dishes in Korean regional cuisine have been handed down through the generations.\nBuddhist cuisine.\nKorean temple cuisine originated in Buddhist temples of Korea. Since Buddhism was introduced into Korea, Buddhist traditions have strongly influenced Korean cuisine, as well. During the Silla period (57 BCE\u00a0\u2013 935 CE), \"chalbap\" (\ucc30\ubc25, a bowl of cooked glutinous rice) \"yakgwa\" (a fried dessert) and \"yumilgwa\" (a fried and puffed rice snack) were served for Buddhist altars and have been developed into types of \"hangwa\", Korean traditional confectionery. During the Goryeo period, \"sangchu ssam\" (wraps made with lettuce), \"yaksik\", and \"yakgwa\" were developed, and since spread to China and other countries. Since the Joseon dynasty, Buddhist cuisine has been established in Korea according to regions and temples.\nOn the other hand, royal court cuisine is closely related to Korean temple cuisine. In the past, when the royal court maids, \"sanggung\", who were assigned to \"Suragan\" (; ; the name of the royal kitchen), where they prepared the king's meals, became old, they had to leave the royal palace. Therefore, many of them entered Buddhist temples to become nuns. As a result, culinary techniques and recipes of the royal cuisine were integrated into Buddhist cuisine.\nVegetarian cuisine.\nVegetarian cookery in Korea may be linked to the Buddhist traditions that influenced Korean culture from the Goryeo dynasty onwards. There are hundreds of vegetarian restaurants in Korea, although historically they have been local restaurants that are unknown to tourists. Most have buffets, with cold food, and vegetarian kimchi and tofu being the main features. \"Bibimbap\" is a common vegan dish. Menus change with seasons. Wine with the alcohol removed and fine teas are also served. The Korean tea ceremony is suitable for all vegetarians and vegans, and began with Buddhist influences. All food is eaten with a combination of stainless steel oval chopsticks and a long-handled shallow spoon called together \"sujeo\".\nCeremonial food.\nFood is an important part of traditions of Korean family ceremonies, which are mainly based on the Confucian culture. Gwan Hon Sang Je (; ), the four family ceremonies (coming-of-age ceremony, wedding, funeral, and ancestral rite) have been considered especially important and elaborately developed, continuing to influence Korean life to these days. Ceremonial food in Korea has developed with variation across different regions and cultures.\nFor example, ancestral rites called \"jesa\" are mainly held on the anniversary of an ancestor's death. Ritual food includes rice, rice cakes, meat and fish, alcohol, and fruit.\nStreet food.\nIn South Korea, inexpensive food may be purchased from \"pojangmacha\", street carts during the day, where customers may eat standing beside the cart or have their food wrapped up to take home. At night, \"pojangmacha\" () become small tents that sell food, drinks, and alcoholic beverages.\nSeasonal street foods include \"hotteok\" and \"bungeoppang\", which are enjoyed in autumn and winter. \"Gyeran-ppang\" and \"hoppang\" are also enjoyed in winter.\nOther common street foods include \"gimbap\" (), \"tteokbokki\" (), \"sundae\", \"twigim\", and \"eomuk\". \"Dak-kkochi\" (), or skewered chicken grilled in various sauces, is also popular. \"Beondegi\" () and \"dalgona/ppopgi\" () are two examples of original street foods many people have enjoyed since childhood. \nEtiquette.\nDining.\nDining etiquette in Korea can be traced back to the Confucian philosophies of the Joseon period. Guidebooks, such as \"Sasojeol\" (\u58eb\u5c0f\u7bc0, \"Elementary Etiquette for Scholar Families\"), written in 1775 by Yi Deokmu (; ), comment on the dining etiquette for the period. Suggestions include items such as \"when you see a fat cow, goat, pig, or chicken, do not immediately speak of slaughtering, cooking or eating it\", \"when you are having a meal with others, do not speak of smelly or dirty things, such as boils or diarrhea,\" \"when eating a meal, neither eat so slowly as to appear to be eating against your will nor so fast as if to be taking someone else's food. Do not throw chopsticks on the table. Spoons should not touch plates, making a clashing sound\", among many other recommendations which emphasized proper table etiquette.\nOther than the etiquette mentioned above, blowing one's nose when having a meal is considered an inappropriate act as well.\nThe eldest male at the table was always served first, and was commonly served in the men's quarters by the women of the house. Women usually dined in a separate portion of the house after the men were served. The eldest men or women always ate before the younger family members. The meal was usually quiet, as conversation was discouraged during meals. In modern times, these rules have become lax, as families usually dine together now and use the time to converse. Of the remaining elements of this decorum, one is that the younger members of the table should not pick up their chopsticks or start eating before the elders of the table or guests and should not finish eating before the elders or guests finish eating.\nIn Korea, unlike in other East Asian cuisines such as Chinese and Japanese, the rice or soup bowl is not lifted from the table when eating from it. This is due to the fact that each diner is given a metal spoon along with the chopsticks known collectively as sujeo. The use of the spoon for eating rice and soups is expected. There are rules which reflect the decorum of sharing communal side dishes; rules include not picking through the dishes for certain items while leaving others, and the spoon used should be clean, because usually diners put their spoons in the same serving bowl on the table. Diners should also cover their mouths when using a toothpick after the meal.\nThe table setup is important as well, and individual place settings, moving from the diner's left should be as follows: rice bowl, spoon, then chopsticks. Hot foods are set to the right side of the table, with the cold foods to the left. Soup must remain on the right side of the diner along with stews. Vegetables remain on the left along with the rice, and kimchi is set to the back while sauces remain in the front.\nDrinking.\nThe manner of drinking alcoholic drinks while dining is significant in Korean dining etiquette. Each diner is expected to face away from the eldest male and cover his mouth when drinking alcohol.\nAccording to Hyang Eum Ju Rye (; ), the drinking etiquette established in Choseon dynasty, it is impolite for a king and his vassal, a father and his son, or a teacher and his student to drink face to face. Also, a guest should not refuse the first drink offered by host, and in the most formal situations, the diner should politely twice refuse a drink offered by the eldest male or a host. When the host offers for the third time, then finally the guest can receive it. If the guest refuses three times, drink is not to be offered any more.\nRoyal court cuisine.\nCollectively known as \"gungjung eumsik\" during the pre-modern era, the foods of the royal palace were reflective of the opulent nature of the past rulers of the Korean peninsula. This nature is evidenced in examples as far back as the Silla kingdom, where a man-made lake (Anapji Lake, located in Gyeongju), was created with multiple pavilions and halls for the sole purpose of opulent banquets, and a spring fed channel, Poseokjeong, was created for the singular purpose of setting wine cups afloat while they wrote poems.\nReflecting the regionalism of the kingdoms and bordering countries of the peninsula, the cuisine borrowed portions from each of these areas to exist as a showcase. The royalty would have the finest regional specialties and delicacies sent to them at the palace. Although there are records of banquets predating the Joseon period, the majority of these records mostly reflect the vast variety of foods, but do not mention the specific foods presented. The meals cooked for the royal family did not reflect the seasons, as the commoner's meals would have. Instead, their meals varied significantly day-to-day. Each of the eight provinces was represented each month in the royal palace by ingredients presented by their governors, which gave the cooks a wide assortment of ingredients to use for royal meals.\nFood was considered significant in the Joseon period. Official positions were created within the Six Ministries (\"State Council\", \uc721\uc870) that were charged with all matters related to procurement and consumption of food and drink for the royal court. The Board of Personnel (\"Ijo\", \uc774\uc870) contained positions specific for attaining rice for the royal family. The Board of Rights (\"Yejo\") were responsible for foods prepared for ancestor rites, attaining wines and other beverages, and medicinal foods. There were also hundreds of slaves and women who worked in the palace that had tasks such as making tofu, liquor, tea, and \"tteok\" (rice cakes). The women were the cooks to the royal palace and were of commoner or low-born families. These women would be split into specific skill sets or \"bureau\" such as the bureau of special foods (\"Saenggwa-bang\", \uc0dd\uacfc\ubc29) or the bureau of cooking foods (\"Soju-bang\", \uc18c\uc8fc\ubc29). These female cooks may have been assisted by male cooks from outside the palace during larger banquets when necessary.\nFive meals were generally served in the royal palace each day during the Joseon period, and records suggest this pattern had existed from antiquity. Three of these meals would be full meals, while the afternoon and after dinner meals would be lighter. The first meal, \"mieumsang\" (), was served at sunrise and was served only on days when the king and queen were not taking herbal medicines. The meal consisted of rice porridge (\"juk\", \uc8fd) made with ingredients such as abalone (\"jeonbokjuk\"), white rice (\"huinjuk\"), mushrooms (\"beoseotjuk\"), pine nuts (\"jatjuk\"), and sesame (\"kkaejuk\"). The side dishes could consist of \"kimchi\", \"nabak kimchi\", oysters, soy sauce, and other items. The porridge was thought to give vitality to the king and queen throughout the day.\nThe \"sura\" () were the main meals of the day. Breakfast was served at ten in the morning, and the evening meals were served between six and seven at night. The set of three tables (\"surasang\", \uc218\ub77c\uc0c1), were usually set with two types of rice, two types of soup, two types of stew (\"jjigae\"), one dish of \"jjim\" (meat stew), one dish of \"jeongol\" (a casserole of meat and vegetables), three types of \"kimchi\", three types of \"jang\" () and twelve side dishes, called 12 cheop (12\ucca9). The meals were set in the \"suragan\" (), a room specifically used for taking meals, with the king seated to the east and the queen to the west. Each had their own set of tables and were attended by three palace servant women known as \"sura sanggung\" (). These women would remove bowl covers and offer the foods to the king and queen after ensuring the dishes were not poisoned.\nBanquets () were held on special occasions in the Korean Royal Palace. These included birthdays of the royal family members, marriages, and national festivals, including Daeborum, Dano, Chuseok, and Dongji. Banquet food was served on individual tables which varied according to the rank of the person. Usually banquet food consisted of ten different types of dishes. Main dishes were prepared based on the seasonal foods. Main dishes of the banquet included \"sinseollo\", \"jeon\", \"hwayang jeok\", \"honghapcho\", \"nengmyun\" and \"mulgimchi\". A typical banquet ingredient was \"chogyetang\" (chicken broth with vinegar), which was prepared with five different chickens, five abalones, ten sea cucumbers, twenty eggs, half a bellflower root, mushrooms, two cups of black pepper, two peeled pine nuts, starch, soy sauce and vinegar. \"Yaksik\" was a favorite banquet dessert.\nHealth effects.\nTraditional Korean diet or Hansik is often associated with spiritual and physical health. While the diet of modern Korean people has become increasingly westernized and consists of numerous non-traditional foods, many believe in the healing power of Hansik. Vegetables and fermented foods are part of a healthy diet around the world, and Hansik includes many vegetable dishes and fermented foods. Three dishes, soup, Kimchi and multigrain rice make up the basic meal pattern of Hansik called three Cheopbansang. Fermented soybean paste Doenjang used in soups and fermented red chili paste Gochujang used in kimchi add health benefits to these foods.\nCertain foods are typically consumed to combat the heat of the summer or the cold months, regain strength during and after an illness, or for general health. Cool noodle Naengmyeon originally from the northern part of the Korean peninsula is now enjoyed in South Korea as well as many parts of the world especially during the hot summer months. Likewise, ginseng chicken soup Samgyetang is often eaten during summer to reduce heat exhaustion and regain stamina.\nFollowing a traditional Korean diet may lower the risk of some health issues including obesity and metabolic syndrome with a decrease in body mass index (BMI), body fat percent, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Fermented foods like kimchi and doenjang contain probiotics which may boost immunity and reduce the incidence or severity of allergic conditions such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. It may also lower the risk of cardiovascular and chronic metabolic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes.\nProbiotics typically found in kimchi include species of genera \"Lactobacillus\", \"Leuconostoc\", and \"Weissella\", and they have been linked to anti-inflammatory effects and health benefits such as improved gut health. Napa cabbage is prepared with much salt and approximately 20% of sodium intake comes from kimchi. An increased risk of gastric cancer among subjects with frequent or high consumption of kimchi was found in some case-control studies. As with other salted foods, moderate consumption may maximize health benefits of kimchi.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This definition, and the related definitions of the prefixes mega (), giga (), etc., are most commonly used for data transfer rates in computer networks, internal bus, hard drive and flash media transfer speeds, and for the capacities of most storage media, particularly hard disk drives, flash-based storage, and DVDs. It is also consistent with the other uses of the metric prefixes in computing, such as CPU clock speeds or measures of performance.\nThe international standard IEC 80000-13 uses the term \"byte\" to mean eight bits (1\u00a0B = 8\u00a0bit). Therefore, 1\u00a0kB = 8000\u00a0bit. One thousand kilobytes (1000\u00a0kB) is equal to one megabyte (1\u00a0MB), where 1\u00a0MB is one million bytes.\nBinary (1024\u00a0bytes).\nThe term \"kilobyte\" has traditionally been used to refer to 1024\u00a0bytes (210\u00a0B). The usage of the metric prefix \"kilo\" for binary multiples arose as a convenience, because 1024 is approximately 1000.\nThe binary interpretation of metric prefixes is still prominently used by the Microsoft Windows operating system. Binary interpretation is also used for random-access memory capacity, such as main memory and CPU cache size, due to the prevalent binary addressing of memory.\nThe binary meaning of the kilobyte for 1024\u00a0bytes typically uses the symbol KB, with an uppercase letter \"K\". The \"B\" is sometimes omitted in informal use. For example, a processor with 65,536\u00a0bytes of cache memory might be said to have \"64\u00a0K\" of cache. In this convention, one thousand and twenty-four kilobytes (1024\u00a0KB) is equal to one megabyte (1\u00a0MB), where 1\u00a0MB is 10242\u00a0bytes.\nIn December 1998, the IEC addressed such multiple usages and definitions by creating prefixes such as kibi, mebi, gibi, etc., to unambiguously denote powers of 1024. Thus the kibibyte, symbol KiB, represents 210\u00a0bytes = 1024\u00a0bytes. These prefixes are now part of IEC 80000-13. The IEC further specified that the kilobyte should only be used to refer to 1000\u00a0bytes. The International System of Units restricts the use of the SI prefixes strictly to powers of 10.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16796", "revid": "244946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16796", "title": "Kuiper belt", "text": "Area of the Solar System beyond the planets, comprising small bodies\nThe Kuiper belt () is a circumstellar disc in the outer Solar System, extending from the orbit of Neptune at 30 astronomical units (AU) to approximately 50\u00a0AU from the Sun. It is similar to the asteroid belt, but is far larger\u201420\u00a0times as wide and 20\u2013200\u00a0times as massive. Like the asteroid belt, it consists mainly of small bodies or remnants from when the Solar System formed. While many asteroids are composed primarily of rock and metal, most Kuiper belt objects are composed largely of frozen volatiles (termed \"ices\"), such as methane, ammonia, and water. The Kuiper belt is home to most of the objects that astronomers generally accept as dwarf planets: Orcus, Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, and Makemake. Some of the Solar System's moons, such as Neptune's Triton and Saturn's Phoebe, may have originated in the region.\nThe Kuiper belt is named in honor of the Dutch astronomer Gerard Kuiper, who conjectured the existence of a version of the belt in 1951. There were researchers before and after him who proposed similar hypoetheses, such as Kenneth Edgeworth in the 1930s. The most direct prediction of the belt was by astronomer Julio \u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez, who published a paper in 1980 suggesting the existence of a comet belt beyond Neptune which could serve as a source for short-period comets.\nIn 1992, minor planet 15760 Albion was discovered, the first Kuiper belt object (KBO) since Pluto (in 1930) and Charon (in 1978). Since its discovery, the number of known KBOs has increased to thousands, and more than \u00a0KBOs over in diameter are thought to exist. The Kuiper belt was initially thought to be the main repository for periodic comets, those with orbits lasting less than 200\u00a0years. Studies since the mid-1990s have shown that the belt is dynamically stable and that comets' true place of origin is the scattered disc, a dynamically active zone created by the outward motion of Neptune 4.5\u00a0billion years ago; scattered-disc objects such as Eris have extremely eccentric orbits that take them as far as 100\u00a0AU from the Sun.\nThe Kuiper belt is distinct from the hypothesized Oort cloud, which is believed to be a thousand times more distant and mostly spherical. The objects within the Kuiper belt, together with the members of the scattered disc and any potential Hills cloud or Oort cloud objects, are collectively referred to as trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). Pluto is the largest and most massive known member of the Kuiper belt and the largest and the second-most-massive known TNO, surpassed only by Eris in the scattered disc. Originally considered a planet, Pluto's status as part of the Kuiper belt caused it to be reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. It is compositionally similar to many other objects of the Kuiper belt, and its orbital period is characteristic of a class of KBOs, known as \"plutinos\", that share the same 2:3 resonance with Neptune.\nThe Kuiper belt and Neptune may be treated as a marker of the extent of the Solar System, alternatives being the heliopause and the distance at which the Sun's gravitational influence is matched by that of other stars (estimated to be between and ).\nHistory.\nAfter the discovery of Pluto in 1930, many speculated that it might not be alone. The region now called the Kuiper belt was hypothesized in various forms for decades. It was only in 1992 that the first direct evidence for its existence was found. The number and variety of prior speculations on the nature of the Kuiper belt have led to continued uncertainty as to who deserves credit for first proposing it.106\nHypotheses.\nThe first astronomer to suggest the existence of a trans-Neptunian population was Frederick C. Leonard. Soon after Pluto's discovery by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930, Leonard pondered whether it was \"likely that in Pluto there has come to light the \"first\" of a \"series\" of ultra-Neptunian bodies, the remaining members of which still await discovery but which are destined eventually to be detected\". That same year, astronomer Armin O. Leuschner suggested that Pluto \"may be one of many long-period planetary objects yet to be discovered\".\nIn 1943, in the \"Journal of the British Astronomical Association\", Kenneth Edgeworth hypothesized that, in the region beyond Neptune, the material within the primordial solar nebula was too widely spaced to condense into planets, and so rather condensed into a myriad smaller bodies. From this he concluded that \"the outer region of the solar system, beyond the orbits of the planets, is occupied by a very large number of comparatively small bodies\"xii and that, from time to time, one of their number \"wanders from its own sphere and appears as an occasional visitor to the inner solar system\",2 becoming a comet.\nIn 1951, in a paper in \"Astrophysics: A Topical Symposium\", Gerard Kuiper speculated on a similar disc having formed early in the Solar System's evolution and concluded that the disc consisted of \"remnants of original clusterings which have lost many members that became stray asteroids, much as has occurred with open galactic clusters dissolving into stars\". In another paper, based upon a lecture Kuiper gave in 1950, also called \"On the Origin of the Solar System\", Kuiper wrote about the \"outermost region of the solar nebula, from 38 to 50 astr. units (i.e., just outside proto-Neptune)\" where \"condensation products (ices of H2O, NH3, CH4, etc.) must have formed, and the flakes must have slowly collected and formed larger aggregates, estimated to range up to 1\u00a0km or more in size\". He continued to write that \"these condensations appear to account for the comets, in size, number and composition\". According to Kuiper \"the planet Pluto, which sweeps through the whole zone from 30 to 50 astr. units, is held responsible for having started the scattering of the comets throughout the solar system\". Kuiper was operating on the assumption, common in his time, that Pluto was far more massive than we now know it to be, and had therefore scattered these bodies out toward the Oort cloud or out of the Solar System; there would not be a Kuiper belt today if this were correct.\nThe hypothesis took many other forms in the following decades. In 1962, physicist Alastair G. W. Cameron postulated the existence of \"a tremendous mass of small material on the outskirts of the solar system\".14 In 1964, Fred Whipple, who popularised the famous \"dirty snowball\" hypothesis for cometary structure, thought that a \"comet belt\" might be massive enough to cause the purported discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus that had sparked the search for Planet X, or, at the very least, massive enough to affect the orbits of known comets. Observation ruled out this hypothesis.14\nIn 1977, Charles Kowal discovered 2060 Chiron, an icy object with an orbit between Saturn and Uranus. He used a blink comparator, the same device that had allowed Clyde Tombaugh to discover Pluto nearly 50 years before. In 1992, another object, 5145 Pholus, was discovered in a similar orbit. Today, an entire population of comet-like bodies, called the centaurs, is known to exist in the region between Jupiter and Neptune. The centaurs' orbits are unstable and have dynamical lifetimes of a few million years. From the time of Chiron's discovery in 1977, astronomers have speculated that the centaurs therefore must be frequently replenished by some outer reservoir.38\nFurther evidence for the existence of the Kuiper belt later emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been known for some time. As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their volatile surfaces to sublimate into space, gradually dispersing them. In order for comets to continue to be visible over the age of the Solar System, they must be replenished frequently. A proposal for such an area of replenishment is the Oort cloud, possibly a spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000\u00a0AU from the Sun first hypothesised by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950. The Oort cloud is thought to be the point of origin of long-period comets, which are those, like Hale\u2013Bopp, with orbits lasting thousands of years.105There is another comet population, known as short-period or periodic comets, consisting of those comets that, like Halley's Comet, have orbital periods of less than 200\u00a0years. By the 1970s, the rate at which short-period comets were being discovered was becoming increasingly inconsistent with their having emerged solely from the Oort cloud.39 For an Oort cloud object to become a short-period comet, it would first have to be captured by the giant planets. In a paper published in \"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society\" in 1980, Uruguayan astronomer Julio Fern\u00e1ndez stated that for every short-period comet to be sent into the inner Solar System from the Oort cloud, 600 would have to be ejected into interstellar space. He speculated that a comet belt from between 35 and 50\u00a0AU would be required to account for the observed number of comets. Following up on Fern\u00e1ndez's work, in 1988 the Canadian team of Martin Duncan, Tom Quinn and Scott Tremaine ran a number of computer simulations to determine if all observed comets could have arrived from the Oort cloud. They found that the Oort cloud could not account for all short-period comets, particularly as short-period comets are clustered near the plane of the Solar System, whereas Oort-cloud comets tend to arrive from any point in the sky. With a \"belt\", as Fern\u00e1ndez described it, added to the formulations, the simulations matched observations. Reportedly because the words \"Kuiper\" and \"comet belt\" appeared in the opening sentence of Fern\u00e1ndez's paper, Tremaine named this hypothetical region the \"Kuiper belt\".191\nDiscovery.\nIn 1987, astronomer David Jewitt, then at MIT, became increasingly puzzled by \"the apparent emptiness of the outer Solar System\". He encouraged then-graduate student Jane Luu to aid him in his endeavour to locate another object beyond Pluto's orbit, because, as he told her, \"If we don't, nobody will.\"50 Using telescopes at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, Jewitt and Luu conducted their search in much the same way as Clyde Tombaugh and Charles Kowal had, with a blink comparator.50 Initially, examination of each pair of plates took about eight hours,51 but the process was sped up with the arrival of electronic charge-coupled devices or CCDs, which, though their field of view was narrower, were not only more efficient at collecting light (they retained 90% of the light that hit them, rather than the 10% achieved by photographs) but allowed the blinking process to be done virtually, on a computer screen. Today, CCDs form the basis for most astronomical detectors. In 1988, Jewitt moved to the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Hawaii. Luu later joined him to work at the University of Hawaii's 2.24\u00a0m telescope at Mauna Kea. Eventually, the field of view for CCDs had increased to 1024 by 1024 pixels, which allowed searches to be conducted far more rapidly.65 Finally, after five years of searching, Jewitt and Luu announced on 30 August 1992 the \"Discovery of the candidate Kuiper belt object 1992 QB1\". This object would later be named 15760 Albion. Six months later, they discovered a second object in the region, (181708) 1993 FW. By 2018, over 2000\u00a0Kuiper belt objects had been discovered.\nOver one thousand bodies were found in a belt in the twenty years (1992\u20132012), after finding 1992 QB1 (named in 2018, 15760 Albion), showing a vast belt of bodies in addition to Pluto and Albion. Even in the 2010s the full extent and nature of Kuiper belt bodies was largely unknown. Finally, the unmanned spacecraft New Horizons conducted the first KBO flybys, providing much closer observations of the Plutonian system (2015) and then Arrokoth (2019).\nStudies conducted since the trans-Neptunian region was first charted have shown that the region now called the Kuiper belt is not the point of origin of short-period comets, but that they instead derive from a linked population called the scattered disc. The scattered disc was created when Neptune migrated outward into the proto-Kuiper belt, which at the time was much closer to the Sun, and left in its wake a population of dynamically stable objects that could never be affected by its orbit (the Kuiper belt proper), and a population whose perihelia are close enough that Neptune can still disturb them as it travels around the Sun (the scattered disc). Because the scattered disc is dynamically active and the Kuiper belt relatively dynamically stable, the scattered disc is now seen as the most likely point of origin for periodic comets.\nName.\nAstronomers sometimes use the alternative name Edgeworth\u2013Kuiper belt to credit Edgeworth, and KBOs are occasionally referred to as EKOs. Brian G. Marsden claims that neither deserves true credit: \"Neither Edgeworth nor Kuiper wrote about anything remotely like what we are now seeing, but Fred Whipple did\".199 David Jewitt comments: \"If anything ... Fern\u00e1ndez most nearly deserves the credit for predicting the Kuiper Belt.\"\nKBOs are sometimes called \"kuiperoids\", a name suggested by Clyde Tombaugh. The term \"trans-Neptunian object\" (TNO) is recommended for objects in the belt by several scientific groups because the term is less controversial than all others\u2014it is not an exact synonym, though, as TNOs include all objects orbiting the Sun past the orbit of Neptune, not just those in the Kuiper belt.\nStructure.\nAt its fullest extent, including its outlying regions (but excluding the scattered disc), the Kuiper belt stretches from roughly 30\u201355\u00a0AU. The main body of the belt is generally accepted to extend from the 2:3 mean-motion resonance (see below) at 39.5\u00a0AU to the 1:2 resonance at roughly 48\u00a0AU. The Kuiper belt is quite thick, with the main concentration extending as much as ten degrees outside the ecliptic plane and a more diffuse distribution of objects extending several times farther. Overall it more resembles a torus or doughnut than a belt. Its mean position is inclined to the ecliptic by 1.86 degrees.\nThe presence of Neptune has a profound effect on the Kuiper belt's structure due to orbital resonances. Over a timescale comparable to the age of the Solar System, Neptune's gravity destabilises the orbits of any objects that happen to lie in certain regions, and either sends them into the inner Solar System or out into the scattered disc or interstellar space. This causes the Kuiper belt to have pronounced gaps in its current layout, similar to the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt. In the region between 40 and 42\u00a0AU, for instance, no objects can retain a stable orbit over such times, and any observed in that region must have migrated there relatively recently.\nClassical belt.\nBetween the 2:3 and 1:2 resonances with Neptune, at approximately 42\u201348\u00a0AU, the gravitational interactions with Neptune occur over an extended timescale, and objects can exist with their orbits essentially unaltered. This region is known as the classical Kuiper belt, and its members comprise roughly two thirds of KBOs observed to date. Because the first modern KBO discovered (Albion, but long called 1992 QB1), is considered the prototype of this group, classical KBOs are often referred to as cubewanos (\"Q-B-1-os\"). The guidelines established by the IAU demand that classical KBOs be given names of mythological beings associated with creation.\nThe classical Kuiper belt appears to be a composite of two separate populations. The first, known as the \"dynamically cold\" population, has orbits much like the planets; nearly circular, with an orbital eccentricity of less than 0.1, and with relatively low inclinations up to about 10\u00b0 (they lie close to the plane of the Solar System rather than at an angle). The cold population also contains a concentration of objects, referred to as the kernel, with semi-major axes at 44\u201344.5\u00a0AU. The second, the \"dynamically hot\" population, has orbits much more inclined to the ecliptic, by up to 30\u00b0. The two populations have been named this way not because of any major difference in temperature, but from analogy to particles in a gas, which increase their relative velocity as they become heated up. Not only are the two populations in different orbits, the cold population also differs in color and albedo, being redder and brighter, has a larger fraction of binary objects, has a different size distribution, and lacks very large objects. The mass of the dynamically cold population is roughly 30 times less than the mass of the hot. The difference in colors may be a reflection of different compositions, which suggests they formed in different regions. The hot population is proposed to have formed near Neptune's original orbit and to have been scattered out during the migration of the giant planets. The cold population, on the other hand, has been proposed to have formed more or less in its current position because the loose binaries would be unlikely to survive encounters with Neptune. Although the Nice model appears to be able to at least partially explain a compositional difference, it has also been suggested the color difference may reflect differences in surface evolution.\nResonances.\nWhen an object's orbital period is an exact ratio of Neptune's (a situation called a mean-motion resonance), then it can become locked in a synchronised motion with Neptune and avoid being perturbed away if their relative alignments are appropriate. If, for instance, an object orbits the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits, and if it reaches perihelion with Neptune a quarter of an orbit away from it, then whenever it returns to perihelion, Neptune will always be in about the same relative position as it began, because it will have completed &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20442 orbits in the same time. This is known as the 2:3 (or 3:2) resonance, and it corresponds to a characteristic semi-major axis of about 39.4\u00a0AU. This 2:3 resonance is populated by about 200\u00a0known objects, including Pluto together with its moons. In recognition of this, the members of this family are known as plutinos. Many plutinos, including Pluto, have orbits that cross that of Neptune, although their resonance means they can never collide. Plutinos have high orbital eccentricities, suggesting that they are not native to their current positions but were instead thrown haphazardly into their orbits by the migrating Neptune. IAU guidelines dictate that all plutinos must, like Pluto, be named for underworld deities. The 1:2 resonance (whose objects complete half an orbit for each of Neptune's) corresponds to semi-major axes of ~47.7\u00a0AU, and is sparsely populated. Its residents are sometimes referred to as twotinos. Other resonances also exist at 3:4, 3:5, 4:7, and 2:5.104 Neptune has a number of trojan objects, which occupy its Lagrangian points, gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing it in its orbit. Neptune trojans are in a 1:1 mean-motion resonance with Neptune and often have very stable orbits.\nAdditionally, there is a relative absence of objects with semi-major axes below 39\u00a0AU that cannot apparently be explained by the present resonances. The currently accepted hypothesis for the cause of this is that as Neptune migrated outward, unstable orbital resonances moved gradually through this region, and thus any objects within it were swept up, or gravitationally ejected from it.107\nKuiper cliff.\nThe 1:2 resonance at 47.8\u00a0AU appears to be an edge beyond which few objects are known. It is not clear whether it is actually the outer edge of the classical belt or just the beginning of a broad gap. Objects have been detected at the 2:5\u00a0resonance at roughly 55\u00a0AU, well outside the classical belt; predictions of a large number of bodies in classical orbits between these resonances have not been verified through observation.\nBased on estimations of the primordial mass required to form Uranus and Neptune, as well as bodies as large as Pluto \"(see )\", earlier models of the Kuiper belt had suggested that the number of large objects would increase by a factor of two beyond 50\u00a0AU, so this sudden drastic falloff, known as the \"Kuiper cliff\", was unexpected, and to date its cause is unknown. Bernstein, Trilling, et al. (2003) found evidence that the rapid decline in objects of 100\u00a0km or more in radius beyond 50\u00a0AU is real, and not due to observational bias. Possible explanations include that material at that distance was too scarce or too scattered to accrete into large objects, or that subsequent processes removed or destroyed those that did. Patryk Lykawka of Kobe University claimed that the gravitational attraction of an unseen large planetary object, perhaps the size of Earth or Mars, might be responsible. An analysis of the TNO data available prior to September 2023 shows that the distribution of objects at the outer rim of the classical Kuiper belt resembles that of the outer main asteroid belt with a gap at about 72\u00a0AU, far from any mean-motion resonances with Neptune; the outer main asteroid belt exhibits a gap induced by the 5:6 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter at 5.875\u00a0AU.\nOrigin.\nThe precise origins of the Kuiper belt and its complex structure are still unclear, and astronomers are awaiting the completion of several wide-field survey telescopes such as Pan-STARRS and the future LSST, which should reveal many currently unknown KBOs. These surveys will provide data that will help determine answers to these questions. Pan-STARRS 1 finished its primary science mission in 2014, and the full data from the Pan-STARRS 1 surveys were published in 2019, helping reveal many more KBOs.\nThe Kuiper belt is thought to consist of planetesimals, fragments from the original protoplanetary disc around the Sun that failed to fully coalesce into planets and instead formed into smaller bodies, the largest less than in diameter. Studies of the crater counts on Pluto and Charon revealed a scarcity of small craters suggesting that such objects formed directly as sizeable objects in the range of tens of kilometers in diameter rather than being accreted from much smaller, roughly kilometer scale bodies. Hypothetical mechanisms for the formation of these larger bodies include the gravitational collapse of clouds of pebbles concentrated between eddies in a turbulent protoplanetary disk or in streaming instabilities. These collapsing clouds may fragment, forming binaries.\nModern computer simulations show the Kuiper belt to have been strongly influenced by Jupiter and Neptune, and also suggest that neither Uranus nor Neptune could have formed in their present positions, because too little primordial matter existed at that range to produce objects of such high mass. Instead, these planets are estimated to have formed closer to Jupiter. Scattering of planetesimals early in the Solar System's history would have led to migration of the orbits of the giant planets: Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune drifted outwards, whereas Jupiter drifted inwards. Eventually, the orbits shifted to the point where Jupiter and Saturn reached an exact 1:2 resonance; Jupiter orbited the Sun twice for every one Saturn orbit. The gravitational repercussions of such a resonance ultimately destabilized the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, causing them to be scattered outward onto high-eccentricity orbits that crossed the primordial planetesimal disc.\nWhile Neptune's orbit was highly eccentric, its mean-motion resonances overlapped and the orbits of the planetesimals evolved chaotically, allowing planetesimals to wander outward as far as Neptune's 1:2 resonance to form a dynamically cold belt of low-inclination objects. Later, after its eccentricity decreased, Neptune's orbit expanded outward toward its current position. Many planetesimals were captured into and remain in resonances during this migration, others evolved onto higher-inclination and lower-eccentricity orbits and escaped from the resonances onto stable orbits. Many more planetesimals were scattered inward, with small fractions being captured as Jupiter trojans, as irregular satellites orbiting the giant planets, and as outer belt asteroids. The remainder were scattered outward again by Jupiter and in most cases ejected from the Solar System reducing the primordial Kuiper belt population by 99% or more.\nThe original version of the currently most popular model, the \"Nice model\", reproduces many characteristics of the Kuiper belt such as the \"cold\" and \"hot\" populations, resonant objects, and a scattered disc, but it still fails to account for some of the characteristics of their distributions. The model predicts a higher average eccentricity in classical KBO orbits than is observed (0.10\u20130.13 versus 0.07) and its predicted inclination distribution contains too few high inclination objects. In addition, the frequency of binary objects in the cold belt, many of which are far apart and loosely bound, also poses a problem for the model. These are predicted to have been separated during encounters with Neptune, leading some to propose that the cold disc formed at its current location, representing the only truly local population of small bodies in the solar system.\nA recent modification of the Nice model has the Solar System begin with five giant planets, including an additional ice giant, in a chain of mean-motion resonances. About 400\u00a0million years after the formation of the Solar System the resonance chain is broken. Instead of being scattered into the disc, the ice giants first migrate outward several AU. This divergent migration eventually leads to a resonance crossing, destabilizing the orbits of the planets. The extra ice giant encounters Saturn and is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and after a series of encounters is ejected from the Solar System. The remaining planets then continue their migration until the planetesimal disc is nearly depleted with small fractions remaining in various locations.\nAs in the original Nice model, objects are captured into resonances with Neptune during its outward migration. Some remain in the resonances, others evolve onto higher-inclination, lower-eccentricity orbits, and are released onto stable orbits forming the dynamically hot classical belt. The hot belt's inclination distribution can be reproduced if Neptune migrated from 24\u00a0AU to 30\u00a0AU on a 30\u00a0Myr timescale. When Neptune migrates to 28\u00a0AU, it has a gravitational encounter with the extra ice giant. Objects captured from the cold belt into the 1:2 mean-motion resonance with Neptune are left behind as a local concentration at 44\u00a0AU when this encounter causes Neptune's semi-major axis to jump outward. The objects deposited in the cold belt include some loosely bound 'blue' binaries originating from closer than the cold belt's current location. If Neptune's eccentricity remains small during this encounter, the chaotic evolution of orbits of the original Nice model is avoided and a primordial cold belt is preserved. In the later phases of Neptune's migration, a slow sweeping of mean-motion resonances removes the higher-eccentricity objects from the cold belt, truncating its eccentricity distribution.\nComposition.\nBeing distant from the Sun and major planets, Kuiper belt objects are thought to be relatively unaffected by the processes that have shaped and altered other Solar System objects; thus, determining their composition would provide substantial information on the makeup of the earliest Solar System. Due to their small size and extreme distance from Earth, the chemical makeup of KBOs is very difficult to determine. The principal method by which astronomers determine the composition of a celestial object is spectroscopy. When an object's light is broken into its component colors, an image akin to a rainbow is formed. This image is called a spectrum. Different substances absorb light at different wavelengths, and when the spectrum for a specific object is unravelled, dark lines (called absorption lines) appear where the substances within it have absorbed that particular wavelength of light. Every element or compound has its own unique spectroscopic signature, and by reading an object's full spectral \"fingerprint\", astronomers can determine its composition.\nAnalysis indicates that Kuiper belt objects are composed of a mixture of rock and a variety of ices such as water, methane, and ammonia. The temperature of the belt is only about 50 K, so many compounds that would be gaseous closer to the Sun remain solid. The densities and rock\u2013ice fractions are known for only a small number of objects for which the diameters and the masses have been determined. The diameter can be determined by imaging with a high-resolution telescope such as the Hubble Space Telescope, by the timing of an occultation when an object passes in front of a star or, most commonly, by using the albedo of an object calculated from its infrared emissions. The masses are determined using the semi-major axes and periods of satellites, which are therefore known only for a few binary objects. The densities range from less than 0.4 to 2.6 g/cm3. The least dense objects are thought to be largely composed of ice and have significant porosity. The densest objects are likely composed of rock with a thin crust of ice. There is a trend of low densities for small objects and high densities for the largest objects. One possible explanation for this trend is that ice was lost from the surface layers when differentiated objects collided to form the largest objects.\nInitially, detailed analysis of KBOs was impossible, and so astronomers were only able to determine the most basic facts about their makeup, primarily their color. These first data showed a broad range of colors among KBOs, ranging from neutral grey to deep red. This suggested that their surfaces were composed of a wide range of compounds, from dirty ices to hydrocarbons. This diversity was startling, as astronomers had expected KBOs to be uniformly dark, having lost most of the volatile ices from their surfaces to the effects of cosmic rays.118 Various solutions were suggested for this discrepancy, including resurfacing by impacts or outgassing. Jewitt and Luu's spectral analysis of the known Kuiper belt objects in 2001 found that the variation in color was too extreme to be easily explained by random impacts. The radiation from the Sun is thought to have chemically altered methane on the surface of KBOs, producing products such as tholins. Makemake has been shown to possess a number of hydrocarbons derived from the radiation-processing of methane, including ethane, ethylene and acetylene.\nAlthough to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due to their faintness, there have been a number of successes in determining their composition. In 1996, Robert H. Brown et al. acquired spectroscopic data on the KBO 1993 SC, which revealed that its surface composition is markedly similar to that of Pluto, as well as Neptune's moon Triton, with large amounts of methane ice. For the smaller objects, only colors and in some cases the albedos have been determined. These objects largely fall into two classes: gray with low albedos, or very red with higher albedos. The difference in colors and albedos is hypothesized to be due to the retention or the loss of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the surface of these objects, with the surfaces of those that formed far enough from the Sun to retain H2S being reddened due to irradiation.\nThe largest KBOs, such as Pluto and Quaoar, have surfaces rich in volatile compounds such as methane, nitrogen and carbon monoxide; the presence of these molecules is likely due to their moderate vapor pressure in the 30\u201350\u00a0K temperature range of the Kuiper belt. This allows them to occasionally boil off their surfaces and then fall again as snow, whereas compounds with higher boiling points would remain solid. The relative abundances of these three compounds in the largest KBOs is directly related to their surface gravity and ambient temperature, which determines which they can retain. Water ice has been detected in several KBOs, including members of the Haumea family such as 1996 TO66, mid-sized objects such as 38628 Huya and 20000 Varuna, and also on some small objects. The presence of crystalline ice on large and mid-sized objects, including 50000 Quaoar where ammonia hydrate has also been detected, may indicate past tectonic activity aided by melting point lowering due to the presence of ammonia.\nMass and size distribution.\nDespite its vast extent, the collective mass of the Kuiper belt is relatively low. The total mass of the dynamically hot population is estimated to be 1% the mass of the Earth. The dynamically cold population is estimated to be much smaller with only 0.03% the mass of the Earth. While the dynamically hot population is thought to be the remnant of a much larger population that formed closer to the Sun and was scattered outward during the migration of the giant planets, in contrast, the dynamically cold population is thought to have formed at its current location. The most recent estimate (2018) puts the total mass of the Kuiper belt at Earth masses based on the influence that it exerts on the motion of planets.\nThe small total mass of the dynamically cold population presents some problems for models of the Solar System's formation because a sizable mass is required for accretion of KBOs larger than in diameter. If the cold classical Kuiper belt had always had its current low density, these large objects simply could not have formed by the collision and mergers of smaller planetesimals. Moreover, the eccentricity and inclination of current orbits make the encounters quite \"violent\" resulting in destruction rather than accretion. The removal of a large fraction of the mass of the dynamically cold population is thought to be unlikely. Neptune's current influence is too weak to explain such a massive \"vacuuming\", and the extent of mass loss by collisional grinding is limited by the presence of loosely bound binaries in the cold disk, which are likely to be disrupted in collisions. Instead of forming from the collisions of smaller planetesimals, the larger object may have formed directly from the collapse of clouds of pebbles.\nThe size distributions of the Kuiper belt objects follow a number of power laws. A power law describes the relationship between \"N\"(\"D\") (the number of objects of diameter greater than \"D\") and \"D\", and is referred to as brightness slope. The number of objects is inversely proportional to some power of the diameter \"D\":\n formula_1 which yields (assuming \"q\" is not 1):formula_2\nEarly estimates that were based on measurements of the apparent magnitude distribution found a value of q = 4 \u00b1 0.5, which implied that there are 8 (=23) times more objects in the 100\u2013200\u00a0km range than in the 200\u2013400\u00a0km range. \nRecent research has revealed that the size distributions of the hot classical and cold classical objects have differing slopes. The slope for the hot objects is q = 5.3 at large diameters and q = 2.0 at small diameters with the change in slope at 110\u00a0km. The slope for the cold objects is q = 8.2 at large diameters and q = 2.9 at small diameters with a change in slope at 140\u00a0km. The size distributions of the scattering objects, the plutinos, and the Neptune trojans have slopes similar to the other dynamically hot populations, but may instead have a divot, a sharp decrease in the number of objects below a specific size. This divot is hypothesized to be due to either the collisional evolution of the population, or to be due to the population having formed with no objects below this size, with the smaller objects being fragments of the original objects.\nThe smallest known Kuiper belt objects with radii below 1\u00a0km have only been detected by stellar occultations, as they are far too dim (magnitude 35) to be seen directly by telescopes such as the Hubble Space Telescope. The first reports of these occultations were from Schlichting et al. in December 2009, who announced the discovery of a small, sub-kilometre-radius Kuiper belt object in archival \"Hubble\" photometry from March 2007. With an estimated radius of or a diameter of , the object was detected by \"Hubble\"'s star tracking system when it briefly occulted a star for 0.3 seconds. In a subsequent study published in December 2012, Schlichting et al. performed a more thorough analysis of archival \"Hubble\" photometry and reported another occultation event by a sub-kilometre-sized Kuiper belt object, estimated to be in radius or in diameter. From the occultation events detected in 2009 and 2012, Schlichting et al. determined the Kuiper belt object size distribution slope to be \"q\" = 3.6 \u00b1 0.2 or \"q\" = 3.8 \u00b1 0.2, with the assumptions of a single power law and a uniform ecliptic latitude distribution. Their result implies a strong deficit of sub-kilometer-sized Kuiper belt objects compared to extrapolations from the population of larger Kuiper belt objects with diameters above 90\u00a0km.\nObservations made by NASA's \"New Horizons\" Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter showed \"higher than model-predicted dust fluxes\" as far as 55\u00a0au, not explained by any existing model.\nScattered objects.\nThe scattered disc is a sparsely populated region, overlapping with the Kuiper belt but extending to beyond 100\u00a0AU. Scattered disc objects (SDOs) have very elliptical orbits, often also very inclined to the ecliptic. Most models of Solar System formation show both KBOs and SDOs first forming in a primordial belt, with later gravitational interactions, particularly with Neptune, sending the objects outward, some into stable orbits (the KBOs) and some into unstable orbits, the scattered disc. Due to its unstable nature, the scattered disc is suspected to be the point of origin of many of the Solar System's short-period comets. Their dynamic orbits occasionally force them into the inner Solar System, first becoming centaurs, and then short-period comets.\nAccording to the Minor Planet Center, which officially catalogues all trans-Neptunian objects, a KBO is any object that orbits exclusively within the defined Kuiper belt region regardless of origin or composition. Objects found outside the belt are classed as scattered objects. In some scientific circles the term \"Kuiper belt object\" has become synonymous with any icy minor planet native to the outer Solar System assumed to have been part of that initial class, even if its orbit during the bulk of Solar System history has been beyond the Kuiper belt (e.g. in the scattered-disc region). They often describe scattered disc objects as \"scattered Kuiper belt objects\". Eris, which is known to be more massive than Pluto, is often referred to as a KBO, but is technically an SDO. A consensus among astronomers as to the precise definition of the Kuiper belt has yet to be reached, and this issue remains unresolved.\nThe centaurs, which are not normally considered part of the Kuiper belt, are also thought to be scattered objects, the only difference being that they were scattered inward, rather than outward. The Minor Planet Center groups the centaurs and the SDOs together as scattered objects.\nTriton.\nDuring its period of migration, Neptune is thought to have captured a large KBO, Triton, which is the only large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit (that is, it orbits opposite to Neptune's rotation). This suggests that, unlike the large moons of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, which are thought to have coalesced from rotating discs of material around their young parent planets, Triton was a fully formed body that was captured from surrounding space. Gravitational capture of an object is not easy: it requires some mechanism to slow down the object enough to be caught by the larger object's gravity. A possible explanation is that Triton was part of a binary when it encountered Neptune. (Many KBOs are members of binaries. See below.) Ejection of the other member of the binary by Neptune could then explain Triton's capture. Triton is only 14% larger than Pluto, and spectral analysis of both worlds shows that their surfaces are largely composed of similar materials, such as methane and carbon monoxide. All this points to the conclusion that Triton was once a KBO that was captured by Neptune during its outward migration.\nLargest KBOs.\nSince 2000, a number of KBOs with diameters of between 500 and , more than half that of Pluto (diameter 2370\u00a0km), have been discovered. Quaoar, a classical KBO discovered in 2002, is over across. Makemake and Haumea, both announced on 29 July 2005, are larger still. Other objects, such as 28978 Ixion (discovered in 2001) and 20000 Varuna (discovered in 2000), measure roughly across.\nPluto.\nThe discovery of these large KBOs in orbits similar to Pluto's led many to conclude that, aside from its relative size, Pluto was not particularly different from other members of the Kuiper belt. Not only are these objects similar to Pluto in size, but many also have natural satellites, and are of similar composition (methane and carbon monoxide have been found both on Pluto and on the largest KBOs). Thus, just as Ceres was considered a planet before the discovery of its fellow asteroids, some began to suggest that Pluto might also be reclassified.\nThe issue was brought to a head by the discovery of Eris, an object in the scattered disc far beyond the Kuiper belt, that is now known to be 27% more massive than Pluto. (Eris was originally thought to be larger than Pluto by volume, but the \"New Horizons\" mission found this not to be the case.) In response, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) was forced to define what a planet is for the first time, and in so doing included in their definition that a planet must have \"cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit\". As Pluto shares its orbit with many other sizable objects, it was deemed not to have cleared its orbit and was thus reclassified from a planet to a dwarf planet, making it a member of the Kuiper belt.\nIt is not clear how many KBOs are large enough to be dwarf planets. Consideration of the surprisingly low densities of many dwarf-planet candidates suggests that not many are. Orcus, Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, and Makemake are accepted by most astronomers; some have proposed other bodies, such as Salacia, M\u00e1ni, Aya, and Ixion.\nSatellites.\nThe six largest TNOs (Eris, Pluto, Gonggong, Makemake, Haumea and Quaoar) are all known to have satellites, and two of them have more than one. A higher percentage of the larger KBOs have satellites than the smaller objects in the Kuiper belt, suggesting that a different formation mechanism was responsible. There are also a high number of binaries (two objects close enough in mass to be orbiting \"each other\") in the Kuiper belt. The most notable example is the Pluto\u2013Charon binary, but it is estimated that around 11% of KBOs exist in binaries.\nExploration.\nOn 19 January 2006, the first spacecraft to explore the Kuiper belt, \"New Horizons\", was launched, which flew by Pluto on 14 July 2015. Beyond the Pluto flyby, the mission's goal was to locate and investigate other, farther objects in the Kuiper belt.\nOn 15 October 2014, it was revealed that \"Hubble\" had uncovered three potential targets, provisionally designated PT1 (\"potential target 1\"), PT2 and PT3 by the \"New Horizons\" team. The objects' diameters were estimated to be in the 30\u201355\u00a0km range; too small to be seen by ground telescopes, at distances from the Sun of 43\u201344\u00a0AU, which would put the encounters in the 2018\u20132019 period. The initial estimated probabilities that these objects were reachable within \"New Horizons\"' fuel budget were 100%, 7%, and 97%, respectively. All were members of the \"cold\" (low-inclination, low-eccentricity) classical Kuiper belt, and thus very different from Pluto. PT1 (given the temporary designation \"1110113Y\" on the HST web site), the most favorably situated object, was magnitude 26.8, 30\u201345\u00a0km in diameter, and was encountered in January 2019. Once sufficient orbital information was provided, the Minor Planet Center gave official designations to the three target KBOs: 2014 MU69 (PT1, now Arrokoth), (PT2), and (PT3). By the fall of 2014, a possible fourth target, , had been eliminated by follow-up observations. PT2 was out of the running before the Pluto flyby.\nOn 26 August 2015, the first target, 2014 MU69 (nicknamed \"Ultima Thule\" and later named 486958 Arrokoth), was chosen. Course adjustment took place in late October and early November 2015, leading to a flyby in January 2019. On 1 July 2016, NASA approved additional funding for \"New Horizons\" to visit the object.\nOn 2 December 2015, \"New Horizons\" detected what was then called 1994 JR1 (later named \"15810 Arawn\") from away.\nOn 1 January 2019, \"New Horizons\" successfully flew by Arrokoth, returning data showing Arrokoth to be a contact binary 32\u00a0km long by 16\u00a0km wide. The Ralph instrument aboard \"New Horizons\" confirmed Arrokoth's red color. Data from the fly-by will continue to be downloaded over the next 20 months.\nNo follow-up missions for \"New Horizons\" are planned, though at least two concepts for missions that would return to orbit or land on Pluto have been studied. Beyond Pluto, there exist many large KBOs that cannot be visited with \"New Horizons\", such as the dwarf planets Makemake and Haumea. New missions would be tasked to explore and study these objects in detail. Thales Alenia Space has studied the logistics of an orbiter mission to Haumea, a high priority scientific target due to its status as the parent body of a collisional family that includes several other TNOs, as well as Haumea's ring and two moons. The lead author, Joel Poncy, has advocated for new technology that would allow spacecraft to reach and orbit KBOs in 10\u201320 years or less. \"New Horizons\" Principal Investigator Alan Stern has informally suggested missions that would flyby the planets Uranus or Neptune before visiting new KBO targets, thus furthering the exploration of the Kuiper belt while also visiting these ice giant planets for the first time since the \"Voyager 2\" flybys in the 1980s.\nDesign studies and concept missions.\nQuaoar has been considered as a flyby target for a probe tasked with exploring the interstellar medium, as it currently lies near the heliospheric nose; Pontus Brandt at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and his colleagues have studied a probe that would flyby Quaoar in the 2030s before continuing to the interstellar medium through the heliospheric nose. Among their interests in Quaoar include its likely disappearing methane atmosphere and cryovolcanism. The mission studied by Brandt and his colleagues would launch using SLS and achieve 30\u00a0km/s using a Jupiter flyby. Alternatively, for an orbiter mission, a study published in 2012 concluded that Ixion and Huya are among the most feasible targets. For instance, the authors calculated that an orbiter mission could reach Ixion after 17 years cruise time if launched in 2039.\nExtrasolar Kuiper belts.\nBy 2006, astronomers had resolved dust discs thought to be Kuiper belt-like structures around nine stars other than the Sun. They appear to fall into two categories: wide belts, with radii of over 50\u00a0AU, and narrow belts (tentatively like that of the Solar System) with radii of between 20 and 30\u00a0AU and relatively sharp boundaries. Beyond this, 15\u201320% of solar-type stars have an observed infrared excess that is suggestive of massive Kuiper-belt-like structures. Most known debris discs around other stars are fairly young, but the two images on the right, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in January 2006, are old enough (roughly 300 million years) to have settled into stable configurations. The left image is a \"top view\" of a wide belt, and the right image is an \"edge view\" of a narrow belt. Computer simulations of dust in the Kuiper belt suggest that when it was younger, it may have resembled the narrow rings seen around younger stars.\nNote.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16797", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16797", "title": "Kraftwerk", "text": "German electronic music band\nKraftwerk (, lit.\u2009'power plant') is a German electronic band formed in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1970 by Ralf H\u00fctter and Florian Schneider. Widely considered innovators and pioneers of electronic music, Kraftwerk was among the first successful acts to popularise the genre. The group began as part of West Germany's experimental krautrock scene in the early 1970s before fully embracing electronic instrumentation, including synthesizers, drum machines, and vocoders. Wolfgang Fl\u00fcr joined the band in 1973 and Karl Bartos in 1975, expanding the band to a quartet.\nOn commercially successful albums such as \"Autobahn\" (1974), \"Trans-Europe Express\" (1977), \"The Man-Machine\" (1978), and \"Computer World\" (1981), Kraftwerk developed a self-described \"robot pop\" style that combined electronic music with pop melodies, sparse arrangements, and repetitive rhythms, while adopting a stylised image including matching suits. Following the release of \"Electric Caf\u00e9\" (1986), Fl\u00fcr left the group in 1987, followed by Bartos in 1990. The band released \"Tour de France Soundtracks\", its most recent studio and concept album, in 2003. Founding member Florian Schneider left in 2008 to pursue solo work until his death in 2020. The band, with new members, has continued to tour under the leadership of Ralf H\u00fctter.\nThe band's work has influenced a diverse range of artists and many genres of modern music, including synth-pop, hip hop, post-punk, techno, house music, ambient, and club music. In 2014, the Recording Academy honoured Kraftwerk with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. It later won the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album with its live album \"3-D The Catalogue\" (2017) at the 2018 ceremony. In 2021, Kraftwerk was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in the early influence category. As of 2024, the band continues to tour, with the members' live performances celebrating Kraftwerk's fiftieth anniversary.\nHistory.\nFormation and early years (1970\u20131973).\nFlorian Schneider (flutes, synthesizers, violin) and Ralf H\u00fctter (organ, synthesizers) met as students at the Robert Schumann Hochschule in D\u00fcsseldorf in the late 1960s, participating in the German experimental music and art scene of the time, which \"Melody Maker\" jokingly dubbed \"krautrock\".\nThey joined a quintet known as Organisation, which released one album, \"Tone Float\" in 1970, issued on RCA Records in the UK, and split shortly thereafter. Schneider became interested in synthesizers, deciding to acquire one in 1970. While visiting an exhibition in their hometown about visual artists Gilbert and George, they see \"two men wearing suits and ties, claiming to bring art into everyday life. The same year, H\u00fctter and Schneider started bringing everyday life into art and form Kraftwerk\".\nEarly Kraftwerk line-ups from 1970 to 1974 fluctuated, as H\u00fctter and Schneider worked with around a half-dozen other musicians during the preparations for and the recording of three albums and sporadic live appearances, including guitarist Michael Rother and drummer Klaus Dinger, who left to form Neu!. The only constant figure in these line-ups was Schneider, whose main instrument at the time was the flute; at times he also played the violin and guitar, all processed through a varied array of electronic devices. H\u00fctter, who left the band for eight months to focus on completing his university studies, played synthesizer and keyboards (including Farfisa organ and electric piano).\nThe band released two free-form experimental rock albums, \"Kraftwerk\" (1970) and \"Kraftwerk 2\" (1972). The albums were mostly exploratory musical improvisations played on a variety of traditional instruments including guitar, bass, drums, organ, flute, and violin. Post-production modifications to these recordings were used to distort the sound of the instruments, particularly audio-tape manipulation and multiple dubbings of one instrument on the same track. Both albums are purely instrumental. Live performances from 1972 to 1973 were mostly made as a duo, using a simple beat-box-type electronic drum machine with preset rhythms taken from an electric organ. Occasionally, they performed with bass players as well. These shows were mainly in Germany, with occasional shows in France. Later in 1973, Wolfgang Fl\u00fcr joined the group for rehearsals, and the unit performed as a trio on the television show \"Aspekte\" for German television network ZDF.\nWith \"Ralf &amp; Florian\", released in 1973, Kraftwerk began to rely more heavily on synthesizers and drum machines. Although almost entirely instrumental, the album marks Kraftwerk's first use of the vocoder in the song \"Ananas Symphonie\" (Pineapple Symphony,) which became one of its musical signatures. According to English music journalist Simon Reynolds, Kraftwerk were influenced by what he called the \"adrenalized insurgency\" of Detroit artists of the late '60s MC5 and the Stooges.\nThe input, expertise, and influence of producer and engineer Konrad \"Conny\" Plank was highly significant in the early years of Kraftwerk. Plank also worked with many of the other leading German electronic acts of that time, including members of Can, Neu!, Cluster, and Harmonia. As a result of his work with Kraftwerk, Plank's studio near Cologne became one of the most sought-after studios in the late 1970s. Plank co-produced the first four Kraftwerk albums.\nInternational breakthrough: \"Autobahn\" and \"Radioactivity\" (1974\u20131976).\nThe release of \"Autobahn\" in 1974 saw Kraftwerk moving away from the sound of its first three albums. H\u00fctter and Schneider had invested in newer technology such as the Minimoog and the EMS Synthi AKS, helping give Kraftwerk a newer, \"disciplined\" sound. \"Autobahn\" was also the last album that Conny Plank engineered. After the commercial success of \"Autobahn\" in the US, where it peaked at number 5 in the Billboard Top LPs &amp; Tapes, H\u00fctter and Schneider invested in updating their studio, thus lessening their reliance on outside producers. At this time the painter and graphic artist Emil Schult became a regular collaborator, designing artwork, cowriting lyrics, and accompanying the group on tour.\nThe year 1975 saw a turning point in Kraftwerk's live shows. With financial support from Phonogram Inc., in the US, they were able to undertake a tour to promote the \"Autobahn\" album, a tour which took them to the US, Canada and the UK for the first time. The tour also saw a new, stable, live line-up in the form of a quartet. H\u00fctter and Schneider continued playing keyboard synthesizers such as the Minimoog and ARP Odyssey, with Schneider's use of flute diminishing. The two men started singing live for the first time, and Schneider processing his voice with a vocoder live. Wolfgang Fl\u00fcr and new recruit Karl Bartos performed on home-made electronic percussion instruments. Bartos also used a Deagan vibraphone on stage. The H\u00fctter-Schneider-Bartos-Fl\u00fcr formation remained in place until the late 1980s and is now regarded as the classic live line-up of Kraftwerk. Emil Schult generally fulfilled the role of tour manager.\nAfter the 1975 \"Autobahn\" tour, Kraftwerk began work on a follow-up album, \"Radio-Activity\" (German title: \"Radio-Aktivit\u00e4t\"). After further investment in new equipment, the Kling Klang Studio became a fully working recording studio. The group used the central theme in radio communication, which had become enhanced on their last tour of the United States. With Emil Schult working on artwork and lyrics, Kraftwerk began to compose music for the new record. Even though \"Radio-Activity\" was less commercially successful than \"Autobahn\" in the UK and United States, the album served to open up the European market for Kraftwerk, earning them a gold disc in France. Kraftwerk made videos and performed several European live dates to promote the album. With the release of \"Autobahn\" and \"Radio-Activity\", Kraftwerk left behind avant-garde experimentation and moved towards the electronic pop tunes for which they are best known.\nIn 1976, Kraftwerk toured in support of the \"Radio-Activity\" album. David Bowie was among the fans of the record and invited the band to support him on his \"Station to Station\" tour, an offer the group declined. Despite some innovations in touring, Kraftwerk took a break from live performances after the \"Radio-Activity\" tour of 1976.\n\"Trans-Europe Express\", \"The Man-Machine\" and \"Computer World\" (1977\u20131982).\nAfter having finished the Radio-Activity tour Kraftwerk began recording \"Trans-Europe Express\" (German: \"Trans-Europa-Express\") at the Kling Klang Studio. \"Trans-Europe Express\" was mixed at the Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. It was around this time that H\u00fctter and Schneider met David Bowie at the Kling Klang Studio. A collaboration was mentioned in an interview (Brian Eno) with H\u00fctter, but it never materialised. The release of \"Trans-Europe Express\" in March 1977 was marked with an extravagant train journey used as a press conference by EMI France. The album won a disco award in New York later that year.\nIn May 1978 Kraftwerk released \"The Man-Machine\" (German: \"Die Mensch-Maschine\"), recorded at the Kling Klang Studio. Due to the complexity of the recording, the album was mixed at Studio Rudas in D\u00fcsseldorf. The band hired sound engineer Leanard Jackson from Detroit to work with Joschko Rudas on the final mix. \"The Man-Machine\" was the first Kraftwerk album where Karl Bartos was cocredited as a songwriter. The cover, produced in black, white and red, was inspired by Russian artist El Lissitzky and the Suprematism movement. Gunther Frohling photographed the group for the cover, a now-iconic image which featured the quartet dressed in red shirts and black ties. After it was released Kraftwerk did not release another album or tour for three years.\nIn May 1981 Kraftwerk released \"Computer World\" (German: \"Computerwelt\") on EMI Records. It was recorded at Kling Klang Studio between 1978 and 1981. Much of this time was spent modifying the studio to make it portable so the band could take it on tour. Some of the electronic vocals on \"Computer World\" were generated using a Texas Instruments language translator. \"Computer Love\" was released as a single backed with the \"Man-Machine\" track \"The Model\". Radio DJs were more interested in the B-side so the single was repackaged by EMI and re-released with \"The Model\" as the A-side. The single reached number one in the UK, making \"The Model\" Kraftwerk's most successful song in that country. As a result, the \"Man-Machine\" album also became a success in the UK, peaking at number 9 in the album chart in February 1982. The band's live set focused increasingly on song-based material, with greater use of vocals and the use of sequencing equipment for both percussion and music. In contrast to their cool and controlled image, the group used sequencers interactively, which allowed for live improvisation. Ironically, Kraftwerk did not own a computer at the time of recording \"Computer World\".\nKraftwerk returned to live performance with the \"Computer World\" tour of 1981, where the band effectively packed up its entire Kling Klang studio and took it along on the road. It also made greater use of live visuals including back-projected slides and films synchronised with the music as the technology developed, the use of hand-held miniaturised instruments during the set, and the use of replica mannequins of themselves to perform on stage during the song \"The Robots\".\n\"Electric Caf\u00e9\" (1982\u20131989).\nIn 1982 Kraftwerk began to work on a new album that initially had the working title \"Technicolor\" but due to trademark issues was changed to \"Electric Caf\u00e9\" for its original release in 1986 (for a remastered re-release in 2009, it was retitled again after its original working title, \"Techno Pop\"). One of the songs from these recording sessions was \"Tour de France\", which EMI released as a single in 1983. This song was a reflection of the band's new-found obsession with cycling. After the physically demanding \"Computer World\" tour, Ralf H\u00fctter had been looking for forms of exercise that fitted in with the image of Kraftwerk; subsequently he encouraged the group to become vegetarians and take up cycling. \"Tour de France\" included sounds that followed this theme including bicycle chains, gear mechanisms and the breathing of the cyclist. At the time of the single's release Ralf H\u00fctter tried to persuade the rest of the band that they should record a whole album based on cycling. The other members of the band were not convinced, and the theme was left to the single alone. \"Tour de France\" was released in German and French. The vocals of the song were recorded on the Kling Klang Studio stairs to create the right atmosphere. \"Tour de France\" was featured in the 1984 film \"Breakin\"', showing the influence that Kraftwerk had on West Coast Hip Hop.\nIn May or June 1982, during the recording of \"Tour de France\", Ralf H\u00fctter was involved in a serious cycling accident. He suffered head injuries and remained in a coma for several days. During 1983 Wolfgang Fl\u00fcr was beginning to spend less time in the studio. Since the band began using sequencers his role as a drummer was becoming less frequent. He preferred to spend his time travelling with his girlfriend. Fl\u00fcr was also experiencing artistic difficulties with the band. Though he toured the world with Kraftwerk as a drummer in 1981, his playing does not appear on that year's \"Computer World\" or on the 1986 album \"Electric Caf\u00e9\". In 1987 he made his last appearance with the band in \"The Telephone Call\" music video. As he declined to perform with the band in its Italian concerts in 1990 he was replaced on-stage by Fritz Hilpert.\n\"The Mix\" (1990\u20131999).\nAfter years of withdrawal from live performance Kraftwerk began to tour Europe more frequently. In February 1990 the band played a few secret shows in Italy. Karl Bartos left the band shortly afterwards. The next proper tour was in 1991, for the album \"The Mix\". H\u00fctter and Schneider wished to continue the synth-pop quartet style of presentation, and recruited Fernando Abrantes as a replacement for Bartos. Abrantes left the band shortly after though. In late 1991, long-time Kling Klang Studio sound engineer Henning Schmitz was brought in to finish the remainder of the tour and to complete a new version of the quartet that remained active until 2008.\nIn 1997 Kraftwerk made a famous appearance at the dance festival Tribal Gathering held in England. In 1998, the group toured the US and Japan for the first time since 1981, along with shows in Brazil and Argentina. Three new songs were performed during this period and a further two tested in soundchecks, which remain unreleased. Following this trek, the group decided to take another break.\nIn July 1999 the single \"Tour de France\" was reissued in Europe by EMI after it had been out of print for several years. It was released for the first time on CD in addition to a repressing of the 12-inch vinyl single. Both versions feature slightly altered artwork that removed the faces of Fl\u00fcr and Bartos from the four-man cycling paceline depicted on the original cover. In 1999 ex-member Fl\u00fcr published his autobiography in Germany, \"Ich war ein Roboter\". Later English-language editions of the book were titled \"Kraftwerk: I Was a Robot\".\nIn 1999, Kraftwerk were commissioned to create an a cappella jingle for the Hannover Expo 2000 world's fair in Germany. The jingle was subsequently developed into the single \"Expo 2000\", which was released in December 1999, and remixed and re-released as \"Expo Remix\" in November 2000.\n\"Tour de France Soundtracks\" and touring the world (2000\u20132009).\nIn August 2003 the band released \"Tour de France Soundtracks\", its first album of new material since 1986's \"Electric Caf\u00e9\". In January and February 2003, before the release of the album, the band started the extensive \"Minimum-Maximum\" world tour, using four customised Sony VAIO laptop computers, effectively leaving the entire Kling Klang studio at home in Germany. The group also obtained a new set of transparent video panels to replace its four large projection screens. This greatly streamlined the running of all of the group's sequencing, sound-generating, and visual-display software. From this point, the band's equipment increasingly reduced manual playing, replacing it with interactive control of sequencing equipment. H\u00fctter retained the most manual performance, still playing musical lines by hand on a controller keyboard and singing live vocals and having a repeating ostinato. Schneider's live vocoding had been replaced by software-controlled speech-synthesis techniques. In November, the group made a surprising appearance at the MTV European Music Awards in Edinburgh, Scotland, performing \"Aerodynamik\". The same year a promotional box set titled \"12345678\" (subtitled \"The Catalogue\") was issued, with plans for a proper commercial release to follow. The box featured remastered editions of the group's eight core studio albums, from \"Autobahn\" to \"Tour de France Soundtracks\". This long-awaited box-set was eventually released in a different set of remasters in November 2009.\nIn June 2005 the band's first-ever official live album, \"Minimum-Maximum\", which was compiled from the shows during the band's tour of spring 2004, received praise from \"NME\". The album contained reworked tracks from existing studio albums. This included a track titled \"Planet of Visions\" that was a reworking of \"Expo 2000\". In support of this release, Kraftwerk made another quick sweep around the Balkans with dates in Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Turkey, and Greece. In December, the \"Minimum-Maximum\" DVD was released. During 2006, the band performed at festivals in Norway, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Spain, Belgium, and Germany.\nIn April 2008 the group played three shows in US cities Minneapolis, Milwaukee, and Denver, and were a coheadliner at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. This was its second appearance at the festival since 2004. Further shows were performed in Ireland, Poland, Ukraine, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore later that year. The touring quartet consisted of Ralf H\u00fctter, Henning Schmitz, Fritz Hilpert, and video technician Stefan Pfaffe, who became an official member in 2008. Original member Florian Schneider was absent from the lineup. H\u00fctter stated that he was working on other projects. On 21 November, Kraftwerk officially confirmed Florian Schneider's departure from the band; \"The Independent\" commented: \"There is something brilliantly Kraftwerkian about the news that Florian Schneider, a founder member of the German electronic pioneers, is leaving the band to pursue a solo career. Many successful bands break up after just a few years. It has apparently taken Schneider and his musical partner, Ralf H\u00fctter, four decades to discover musical differences.\" Kraftwerk's headline set at Global Gathering in Melbourne, Australia, on 22 November was cancelled moments before it was scheduled to begin, due to Fritz Hilpert experiencing a medical emergency.\nIn 2009, Kraftwerk performed concerts with special 3D background graphics in Wolfsburg, Germany; Manchester, UK; and Randers, Denmark. Members of the audience were able to watch this multimedia part of the show with 3D glasses, which were given out. During the Manchester concert (part of the 2009 Manchester International Festival) four members of the GB cycling squad (Jason Kenny, Ed Clancy, Jamie Staff and Geraint Thomas) rode around the Velodrome while the band performed \"Tour de France\". The group also played several festival dates, the last being at the Bestival 2009 in September, on the Isle of Wight. 2009 also saw the release of \"The Catalogue\" box set in November. It is a 12-inch album-sized box set containing all eight remastered CDs in cardboard slipcases, as well as LP-sized booklets of photographs and artwork for each individual album.\n\"The Catalogue\" and continued touring (2010\u20132017).\nAlthough not officially confirmed, Ralf H\u00fctter suggested that a second boxed set of their first three experimental albums\u2014\"Kraftwerk\", \"Kraftwerk 2\" and \"Ralf and Florian\"\u2014could be on its way, possibly seeing commercial release after their next studio album: \"We've just never really taken a look at those albums. They've always been available, but as really bad bootlegs. Now we have more artwork. Emil has researched extra contemporary drawings, graphics, and photographs to go with each album, collections of paintings that we worked with, and drawings that Florian and I did. We took a lot of Polaroids in those days.\" Kraftwerk also released an iOS app called Kraftwerk Kling Klang Machine. The Lenbach House in Munich exhibited some Kraftwerk 3-D pieces in Autumn 2011. Kraftwerk performed three concerts to open the exhibit.\nKraftwerk played at Ultra Music Festival in Miami on 23 March 2012. Initiated by Klaus Biesenbach, the Museum of Modern Art of New York organised an exhibit titled \"Kraftwerk \u2013 Retrospective 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\" where the band performed their studio discography from \"Autobahn\" to \"Tour de France\" over the course of eight days to sell-out crowds. The exhibit later toured to the Tate Gallery as well as to https:// in D\u00fcsseldorf. Kraftwerk performed at the No Nukes 2012 Festival in Tokyo, Japan. Kraftwerk was also going to play at the Ultra Music Festival in Warsaw, but the event was cancelled; instead, Kraftwerk performed at Way Out West in Gothenburg. A limited edition version of the \"Catalogue\" box set was released during the retrospective, restricted to 2000 sets. Each box was individually numbered and inverted the colour scheme of the standard box. In December, Kraftwerk stated on its website that it would be playing its \"Catalogue\" in D\u00fcsseldorf and at London's Tate Modern. Kraftwerk tickets were priced at \u00a360 in London, but fans compared that to the $20 ticket price for tickets at New York's MoMA in 2012, which caused consternation. Even so, the demand for the tickets at The Tate was so high that it shut down the website.\nIn March 2013, the band was not allowed to perform at a music festival in China due to unspecified \"political reasons\". In an interview in June after performing the eight albums of \"The Catalogue\" in Sydney, Ralf H\u00fctter stated: \"Now we have finished one to eight, now we can concentrate on number nine.\" In July, it performed at the 47th Montreux Jazz Festival. The band also played a 3-D concert on 12 July at Scotland's biggest festival \u2013 T in the Park \u2013 in Balado, Kinross, as well as 20 July at Latitude Festival in Suffolk, and 21 July at the Longitude Festival in Dublin.\nIn October 2013 the band played four concerts, over two nights, in Eindhoven, Netherlands. The venue, Evoluon (the former technology museum of Philips Electronics, now a conference center) was handpicked by Ralf H\u00fctter, for its retro-futuristic UFO-like architecture. Bespoke visuals of the building, with the saucer section descending from space, were displayed during the rendition of \"Spacelab.\"\nIn 2014, Kraftwerk brought its four-night, 3D \"Catalogue\" tour to the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, and at NYC's United Palace Theatre. It also played at the Cirkus in Stockholm, Sweden and at the music festival Summer Sonic in Tokyo, Japan. In November 2014 the 3D \"Catalogue\" live set was played in Paris, France, at the brand new Fondation Louis-Vuitton from 6 to 14 November. and then in the iconic Paradiso concert hall in Amsterdam, Netherlands, where they played before in 1976. In 2015, Ralf H\u00fctter, being told that the Tour de France would be starting that year in the nearby Dutch city of Utrecht, decided that Kraftwerk would perform during the \"Grand D\u00e9part\". Eventually the band played three concerts 3 and 4 July in TivoliVredenburg performing \"Tour de France Soundtracks\" and visited the start of the Tour in-between.\nAt the request of race director Christian Prudhomme, Kraftwerk performed at the Tour de France on 1 July 2017, this time in Kraftwerk's hometown D\u00fcsseldorf. French electronic band Air opened the concert, invited by Kraftwerk. Concertgoers were offered 3D glasses to perceive stereoscopic effects on the video screen.\n\"3-D The Catalogue\" and Schneider's death (2017\u2013present).\nIn April 2017, Kraftwerk announced \"3-D The Catalogue\", a live album and video documenting performances of all eight albums in \"The Catalogue\" that was released 26 May 2017. It is available in multiple formats, the most extensive of which being a 4-disc Blu-ray set with a 236-page hardback book. The album was nominated for the Grammy Awards for Best Dance/Electronic Album and Best Surround Sound Album at the ceremony that took place on 28 January 2018, winning the former, which became the band's first Grammy win.\nOn 20 July 2018, at a concert in Stuttgart, German astronaut Alexander Gerst performed \"Spacelab\" with the band while aboard the International Space Station, joining via a live video link. Gerst played melodies using a tablet as his instrument alongside H\u00fctter as a duet, and delivered a short message to the audience.\nOn 20 July 2019, Kraftwerk headlined the Saturday night lineup on the Lovell Stage at Bluedot Festival, a music and science festival held annually at Jodrell Bank Observatory, Cheshire, UK. The 2019 festival celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing.\nOn 21 April 2020, Florian Schneider died at age 73 after a brief battle with cancer. On 3 July 2020, the German-language versions of \"Trans Europe Express\", \"The Man Machine\", \"Computer World\", \"Techno Pop\" and \"The Mix\", alongside \"3-D The Catalogue\", were released worldwide on streaming services for the first time.\nOn 21 December 2020, Parlophone/WEA released \"Remixes\", a digital compilation album. It includes remixed tracks taken from singles released 1991, 1999, 2000, 2004 and 2007, plus the previously unreleased \"Non Stop\", a version of \"Musique Non-Stop\" used as a jingle by MTV Europe beginning in 1993. The cover re-uses the cover from \"Expo Remix\". The compilation was released on CD and vinyl in 2022.\nOn 30 October 2021, Kraftwerk was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. In November 2021, the band announced plans for a 2022 North American tour. With the members' live performances celebrating Kraftwerk's fiftieth anniversary, the \"Remixes\" compilation album came out on compact disc and vinyl for the first time in addition.\nFrom 27 May to 10 July 2022, the formation undertook a successful North American tour, performing in 24 cities.\nSince 2023, it has begun visualising its music on the fa\u00e7ades of castles and other historic buildings in a special way.\nIn May 2024, it performed nine nights at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, presenting one of its eight albums each night and another concert as the ninth gig.\nOn 27 July 2024, at the Fuji Rock Festival in Naeba, Kraftwerk played a cover version of another artist's work for the first time: \"Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence\" by Ryuichi Sakamoto, who died in 2023. H\u00fctter had been friends with Sakamoto since 1981. After performing \"Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence\", Kraftwerk played \"Radioactivity\", for which Sakamoto wrote the Japanese lyrics in 2012.\nOn 4 December 2024, Kraftwerk announced their Multimedia Tour to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of \"Autobahn\", enlisting professional skateboarder Tony Hawk in doing so.\nMusic and artistry.\nStyle.\nKraftwerk have been recognised as pioneers of electronic music The group was also inspired by the funk music of James Brown and, later, punk rock. They were initially connected to the German krautrock scene. In the mid-1970s, they transitioned to an electronic sound which they described as \"robot pop\". Kraftwerk's lyrics dealt with post-war European urban life and technology\u2014traveling by car on the \"Autobahn\", traveling by train, using home computers, and the like. They were influenced by the modernist Bauhaus aesthetic, seeing art as inseparable from everyday function.\nThe lyrics tend towards minimalism but reveal both an innocent celebration of, and a knowing caution about, the modern world, as well as playing an integral role in the rhythmic structure of the songs. Many of Kraftwerk's songs express the paradoxical nature of modern urban life: a strong sense of alienation coexisting with a celebration of the joys of modern technology. In its early incarnation, the band pursued an avant-garde, experimental rock style inspired by the compositions of Karlheinz Stockhausen. H\u00fctter has also listed the Beach Boys as a major influence. The group was also inspired by the funk music of James Brown and, later, punk rock. They were initially connected to the German krautrock scene. In the mid-1970s, they transitioned to an electronic sound which they described as \"robot pop\". Kraftwerk's lyrics dealt with post-war European urban life and technology\u2014traveling by car on the \"Autobahn\", traveling by train, using home computers, and the like. They were influenced by the modernist Bauhaus aesthetic, seeing art as inseparable from everyday function. Usually, the lyrics are very minimal but reveal both an innocent celebration of, and a knowing caution about, the modern world, as well as playing an integral role in the rhythmic structure of the songs. Many of Kraftwerk's songs express the paradoxical nature of modern urban life: a strong sense of alienation existing side by side with a celebration of the joys of modern technology.\nStarting with the release of \"Autobahn\", Kraftwerk began to release a series of concept albums (\"Radio-Activity\", \"Trans-Europe Express\", \"The Man-Machine\", \"Computer World\", \"Tour de France Soundtracks\"). All of Kraftwerk's albums from \"Trans Europe Express\" onwards, except \"Tour de France Soundtracks\", have been released in separate versions: one with German vocals for sale in Germany, Switzerland and Austria and one with English vocals for the rest of the world, with occasional variations in other languages when conceptually appropriate. Live performance has always played an important part in Kraftwerk's activities. Also, despite its live shows generally being based around formal songs and compositions, live improvisation often plays a noticeable role in its performances. This trait can be traced back to the group's roots in the first experimental Krautrock scene of the late 1960s, but, significantly, it has continued to be a part of its playing even as it makes ever greater use of digital and computer-controlled sequencing in its performances. Some of the band's familiar compositions have been observed to have developed from live improvisations at its concerts or sound-checks.\nTechnological innovations.\nThroughout their career, Kraftwerk have pushed the limits of music technology with some notable innovations, such as home-made instruments and custom-built devices. The group has always perceived their Kling Klang Studio as a complex music instrument, as well as a sound laboratory; Florian Schneider in particular developed a fascination with music technology, with the result that the technical aspects of sound generation and recording gradually became his main fields of activity within the band. Alexei Monroe called Kraftwerk the \"first successful artists to incorporate representations of industrial sounds into non-academic electronic music\".\nKraftwerk used a custom-built vocoder on their albums \"Ralf &amp; Florian\" and \"Autobahn\"; the device was constructed by engineers P. Leunig and K. Obermayer of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt Braunschweig. H\u00fctter and Schneider received a patent for an electronic drum kit with sensor pads, filed in July 1975 and issued in June 1977. It must be hit with metal sticks, which are connected to the device to complete a circuit that triggers analog synthetic percussion sounds. The band first performed in public with this device in 1973, on the television program \"Aspekte\" (on the all-German channel Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen), where it was played by Wolfgang Fl\u00fcr. They created drum machines for \"Autobahn\" and \"Trans-Europe Express\".\nOn the \"Radio-Activity\" tour in 1976 Kraftwerk tested out an experimental light-beam-activated drum cage allowing Fl\u00fcr to trigger electronic percussion through arm and hand movements. Unfortunately, the device did not work as planned, and it was quickly abandoned. The same year Ralf H\u00fctter and Florian Schneider commissioned Bonn-based \"Synthesizerstudio Bonn, Matten &amp; Wiechers\" to design and build the Synthanorma Sequenzer with Intervallomat, a 4\u00d78 / 2\u00d716 / 1\u00d732 step-sequencer system with some features that commercial products couldn't provide at that time. The music sequencer was used by the band for the first time to control the electronic sources creating the rhythmic sound of the album \"Trans-Europe Express\".\nSince 2002, Kraftwerk's live performances have been conducted with the use of virtual technology (i.e. software replicating and replacing original analogue or digital equipment). According to Fritz Hilpert, \"the mobility of music technology and the reliability of the notebooks and software have greatly simplified the realization of complex touring setups: we generate all sounds on the laptops in real time and manipulate them with controller maps. It takes almost no time to get our compact stage system set up for performance. [...] This way, we can bring our Kling-Klang Studio with us on stage. The physical light weight of our equipment also translates into an enormous ease of use when working with software synthesizers and sound processors. Every tool imaginable is within immediate reach or just a few mouse clicks away on the Internet.\"\nReclusiveness and eccentricity.\nThe band is also known for being notoriously reclusive, providing rare and enigmatic interviews, using life-size mannequins and robots while conducting official photo shoots, refusing to answer fanmail and barring visitors from the Kling Klang Studio, the precise location of which they used to keep secret.\nAnother notable example of this eccentric behavior was reported to Johnny Marr of the Smiths by Karl Bartos, who explained that anyone trying to contact the band for collaboration would be told the studio telephone did not have a ringer since, while recording, the band did not like to hear any kind of noise pollution. Instead, callers were instructed to phone the studio precisely at a certain time, whereupon the phone would be answered by Ralf H\u00fctter, despite never hearing the phone ring.\nChris Martin of Coldplay recalled in a 2007 article in \"Q\" magazine the process of requesting permission to use the melody from the track \"Computer Love\" on \"Talk\" from the album \"X&amp;Y\". He sent a letter through the lawyers of the respective parties and several weeks later received an envelope containing a handwritten reply that simply said \"yes\".\nInfluence and legacy.\nAccording to music journalist Neil McCormick, Kraftwerk might be \"the most influential group in pop history\". \"NME\" wrote: \"'The Beatles and Kraftwerk' may not have the ring of 'the Beatles and the Stones', but nonetheless, these are the two most important bands in music history\". AllMusic wrote that their music \"resonates in virtually every new development to impact the contemporary pop scene of the late 20th century\".\nKraftwerk's musical style and image can be heard and seen in 1980s synth-pop groups such as Gary Numan, Ultravox, John Foxx, Visage, Simple Minds, The Human League, Soft Cell, and Yellow Magic Orchestra. Depeche Mode's composer Martin Gore said: \"For anyone of our generation involved in electronic music, Kraftwerk were the godfathers\". Daniel Miller, founder of Mute Records, purchased the vocoder used by Kraftwerk in their early albums, comparing it to owning \"the guitar Jimi Hendrix used on 'Purple Haze'\". Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys, founding members of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), have stated that Kraftwerk was a major reference on their early work; OMD covered \"Neon Lights\" on the 1991 album, \"Sugar Tax\". \nKraftwerk influenced other forms of music such as hip hop, house, and drum and bass, and they are also regarded as one of the pioneers of the electro genre. Karl Hyde of Underworld has referenced Kraftwerk as a prominent influence. Most notably, \"Trans Europe Express\" and \"Numbers\" were interpolated into \"Planet Rock\" by Afrika Bambaataa &amp; the Soul Sonic Force, one of the earliest hip-hop/electro hits. Kraftwerk helped ignite the New York electro-movement. Techno was created by three musicians from Detroit, often referred to as the 'Belleville three' (Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson &amp; Derrick May), who fused the repetitive melodies of Kraftwerk with funk rhythms. The Belleville three were heavily influenced by Kraftwerk and their sounds because Kraftwerk's sounds appealed to the middle-class black people residing in Detroit at this time.\nThe electronic band Ladytron were inspired by Kraftwerk's song \"The Model\" when they composed their debut single \"He Took Her to a Movie\". Aphex Twin noted Kraftwerk as one of his biggest influences and cited \"Computer World\" as a very influential album towards his music and sound. Bj\u00f6rk has cited the band as one of her main musical influences. Electronic musician Kompressor has cited Kraftwerk as an influence. The band was also mentioned in the song \"Rappers We Crush\" by Kompressor and MC Frontalot (\"I hurry away, get in my Chrysler. Oh, the dismay!/Someone's replaced all of my Backstreet Boys with Kraftwerk tapes!\"). Dr. Alex Paterson of the Orb listed \"The Man-Machine\" as one of his 13 favourite albums of all time. According to \"NME\", Kraftwerk's pioneering \"robot pop\" also spawned groups like The Prodigy and Daft Punk.\nKraftwerk inspired many acts from other styles and genres, along with having their work been repeatedly sampled. David Bowie's \"V-2 Schneider\", from the 1977's \"Heroes\" album, was a tribute to Florian Schneider. Post-punk bands Joy Division and New Order were heavily influenced by the band. Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis was a fan, and showed his colleagues records that would influence their music. New Order also sampled \"Uranium\" in its biggest hit \"Blue Monday\". Siouxsie and the Banshees recorded a cover of \"Hall of Mirrors\" on their 1987 album \"Through the Looking Glass\", which was lauded by Ralf H\u00fctter: \"In general, we consider cover versions as an appreciation of our work. The version of 'Hall of Mirrors' by Siouxsie and the Banshees is extraordinary, just like the arrangements of Alexander B\u0103l\u0103nescu for his Balanescu Quartet release [of \"Possessed\", 1992]. We also like the album \"El Baile Alem\u00e1n\" of Se\u00f1or Coconut a lot.\" Members of Blondie have admitted on several occasions that Kraftwerk were an important reference for their sound by the time they were working on their third album \"Parallel Lines\". The worldwide hit \"Heart of Glass\" turned radically from an initial reggae-flavoured style to its distinctive electronic sound in order to imitate the technological approach of Kraftwerk's albums and adapt it to a disco concept. Simple Minds and U2 each recorded cover versions of \"Neon Lights\"; Simple Minds' version was included on their 2001 all-covers album \"Neon Lights\", and U2 included \"Neon Lights\" as the B-side of their 2004 single \"Vertigo\". LCD Soundsystem's \"Get Innocuous!\" is built on a sample of \"The Robots\". Rammstein covered Kraftwerk's song \"Das Modell\", releasing it as a non-album single in 1997. John Frusciante cited the group's ability to experiment of as an inspiration when working in a recording studio.\nIn 1989, a sped up version of Kraftwerk's song \"Electric Caf\u00e9\" began appearing as the theme song for a series of sketches on \"Saturday Night Live\" called \"Sprockets\", a German television spoof by Mike Myers. A 1996 episode of sitcom Father Ted briefly featured a live musical performance by \"Fr. Tiernan, Fr. Rafter, Fr. Cafferty and Fr. Leonard\", whose music and stage presence are heavily inspired by Kraftwerk. The 1998 comedy \"The Big Lebowski\" features a fictional band called Autobahn, a parody of Kraftwerk and their 1974 record \"Autobahn\".\nIn January 2018, BBC Radio 4 broadcast the 30-minute documentary \"Kraftwerk: Computer Love\", which examined \"how Kraftwerk's classic album \"Computer World\" has changed people's lives.\"\nIn October 2019, Kraftwerk were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for 2020. On 12 May 2021, Kraftwerk were announced as an official inductee into the Hall, for the class of 2021.\nMembers.\nFormer members.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAwards and achievements.\nGrammy Awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16800", "revid": "50648167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16800", "title": "Kalmar Union", "text": "Personal union in Scandinavia\nThe Kalmar Union was a personal union in Scandinavia, agreed at Kalmar in Sweden as designed by Queen Margaret of Denmark. From 1397 to 1523, it joined under a single monarch the three kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden (then including much of present-day Finland), and Norway, together with Norway's maritime colonies (then including Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland).\nThe union was not quite continuous; there were several short interruptions. Legally, the countries remained separate sovereign states, but their domestic and foreign policies were directed by a common monarch. Gustav Vasa's election as King of Sweden on 6 June 1523, and his triumphant entry into Stockholm 11 days later, marked Sweden's final secession from the Kalmar Union. The Danish king formally renounced his claim to Sweden in 1524 at the Treaty of Malm\u00f6.\nHistory.\nInception.\nThe union was the work of Scandinavian aristocracy who sought to counter the influence of the Hanseatic League, a northern German trade league centered around the Baltic and North Seas. Denmark in particular was in a power struggle with the League and had recently suffered a humiliating defeat in the Danish-Hanseatic War (1361-1370) that allowed the League to become even more powerful. On the personal level, the union was achieved by Queen Margaret I of Denmark (1353\u20131412). She was a daughter of King Valdemar IV of Denmark and had married King Haakon VI of Norway and Sweden, who was the son of King Magnus IV of Sweden, Norway and Scania. Margaret succeeded in having her and Haakon's son Olaf recognized as heir to the throne of Denmark. In 1376, Olaf inherited the crown of Denmark from his maternal grandfather as King Olaf II, with his mother as guardian; when Haakon VI died in 1380, Olaf also inherited the crown of Norway.\nMargaret became regent of Denmark and Norway when Olaf died in 1387, leaving her without an heir. She adopted her great-nephew Eric of Pomerania the same year. In 1388, Swedish nobles called upon her help against King Albert. After Margaret defeated Albert in 1389, her heir Eric was proclaimed King of Norway. Eric was subsequently elected King of Denmark and Sweden in 1396 under the banner of the House of Griffin. His coronation was held in Kalmar on 17 June 1397.\nOne main impetus for the union's formation was to block German expansion northward into the Baltic region. The main reason for its failure to survive was the perpetual struggle between the monarch, who wanted a strong unified state, and the Swedish and Danish nobility, which did not.\nThe Union lost territory when Orkney and Shetland were pledged by Christian I, in his capacity as King of Norway, as security against the payment of the dowry of his daughter Margaret, betrothed to James III of Scotland in 1468. The money was never paid, so in 1472 the Kingdom of Scotland annexed the islands.\nInternal conflict.\nDiverging interests (especially the Swedish nobility's dissatisfaction with the dominant role played by Denmark and Holstein) gave rise to a conflict that hampered the union in several intervals starting in the 1430s. The Engelbrekt rebellion, which started in 1434, led to the overthrow of King Erik (in Denmark and Sweden in 1439, as well as Norway in 1442). The aristocracy sided with the rebels.\nKing Erik's foreign policy, in particular his conflict with the Hanseatic League, necessitated greater taxation and complicated exports of iron, which in turn may have precipitated the rebellion. Discontent with the nature of Erik's regime has also been cited as a motivating factor for the rebellion. Erik also lacked a standing army and had limited tax revenues.\nThe death of Christopher of Bavaria (who had no heirs) in 1448 ended a period in which the three Scandinavian kingdoms were uninterruptedly united for a lengthy period. Karl Knutsson Bonde ruled as king of Sweden (1448\u20131457, 1464\u20131465, and 1467\u20131470) and Norway (1449-1450). Christian of Oldenburg was king of Denmark (1448\u20131481), Norway (1450\u20131481) and Sweden (1457\u20131464). Karl and Christian fought over control of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, leading Christian to seize Sweden from him from 1457 to 1464 before a rebellion led Karl to become king of Sweden again. When Karl died in 1470, Christian tried to become king of Sweden again, but was defeated by Sten Sture the Elder in the 1471 battle of Brunkeberg outside Stockholm.\nAfter Karl's death, Sweden was mostly ruled by a series of \"protectors of the realm\" (\"riksf\u00f6rest\u00e5ndare\"), with the Danish kings attempting to assert control. First of these protectors was Sten Sture, who kept Sweden under his control until 1497, when the Swedish nobility deposed him. A peasant rebellion led Sture to become regent of Sweden again in 1501. After his death, Sweden was ruled by Svante Nilsson (1504\u20131512) and then Svante's son Sten Sture the Younger (1512\u20131520). Sten Sture the Younger was killed in the 1520 Battle of Bogesund when the Danish king Christian II invaded Sweden with a large army. Subsequently, Christian II was crowned King of Sweden, and supporters of Sten Sture were executed en masse in the Stockholm Bloodbath.\nSwedish War of Liberation.\nAfter the Stockholm Bloodbath, Gustav Vasa (whose father, Erik Johansson, was executed) travelled to Dalarna, where he organized a rebellion against Christian II. Vasa made an alliance with L\u00fcbeck and successfully conquered most of Sweden. He was elected King of Sweden in 1523, effectively ending the Kalmar Union. After the Northern Seven Years' War, the Treaty of Stettin (1570) saw Frederick II renounce all claims to Sweden.\nEnd and aftermath.\nOne of the union's last structures remained until 1536/1537, when the Danish Privy Council, in the aftermath of the Count's Feud, declared Norway a Danish province. In practice, Norway kept its status as a separate kingdom and its own laws, but its council and other central institutions were dissolved, and it became politically subordinate to Denmark. This Denmark\u2013Norway union lasted nearly three centuries, until Norway was ceded to Sweden in 1814. The later Swedish\u2013Norwegian union lasted until 1905, when Prince Carl of Denmark was elected king of independent Norway.\nAccording to historian Sverre Bagge, the Kalmar Union was unstable for several reasons:\nGallery.\nThe Kalmar Union monarchs were:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Developed for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), it is known for its focus on real-world situations.\nKrav Maga was originally developed by Hungarian-born Israeli martial artist Imi Lichtenfeld. Having grown up in Bratislava during a time of antisemitic unrest, Lichtenfeld used his training as a boxer and wrestler to defend Jewish neighborhoods against attackers in the mid-to-late 1930s, becoming an experienced street fighter. After his immigration to Mandatory Palestine in the late 1940s, he began to provide lessons on combat training to Jewish paramilitary groups that would later form the IDF during the 1948 Palestine war. As an instructor, he compiled his knowledge and experience into the combat system that would later become known as Krav Maga. This system would continue to be taught long after he left the IDF.\nFrom the outset, the original concept of Krav Maga was to take the most effective and practical techniques of other fighting styles (originally European boxing, wrestling, and street fighting) and make them rapidly teachable to conscripted soldiers. It has a philosophy emphasizing aggression and simultaneous defensive and offensive manoeuvres. It has been used by Israeli special forces and regular infantry units alike. Closely related variations have been developed and adopted by Israeli law enforcement and intelligence organizations, and there are several organizations teaching variations of Krav Maga internationally. There are two forms of Krav Maga, with one type adapted for Israeli security forces and the other type adapted for civilian use.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"krav maga\" in Hebrew is literally translated as 'contact combat' \u2013 the three letter root of the first word is \"q-r-b\" (), and the noun derived from this root means either \"combat\" or \"battle\", while the second word is a participle form derived from the verb root \"n-g-\u2018\" (), that literally means either \"contact\" or \"touch\".\nBasic principles.\nLike most martial arts, Krav Maga encourages students to avoid physical confrontation. If this is impossible or unsafe, it promotes finishing a fight as quickly and aggressively as possible. Attacks are aimed at the most vulnerable parts of the body, and training is not limited to techniques that avoid severe injury; some even permanently injure or kill the opponent.\nStudents learn to defend against all variety of attacks and are taught to counter in the quickest and most efficient way.\nIdeas in Krav Maga include:\nTraining can also cover the study and development of situational awareness to develop an understanding of one's surroundings, learning to understand the psychology of a street confrontation, and identifying potential threats before an attack occurs. It may also cover physical and verbal methods to avoid violence whenever possible. It also teaches mental toughness, using controlled scenarios to strengthen mental fortitude in order for students to control the impulse and not do something rash, but instead attack only when necessary and as a last resort.\nTechniques.\nSome of the key focuses of techniques in Krav Maga are\u2014as described above\u2014effectiveness and instinctive response under stress. To that end, Krav Maga is an eclectic system that has not sought to replace existing effective techniques, taking what is useful from available systems, for example:\nSince the early 21st century, a number of Krav Maga schools have introduced technical influences from other arts as well. These include Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Arnis/Kali/Escrima and Silat. This reflects Krav Maga's attitude, across a multitude of lineages, as an ever-evolving style, which continues to borrow ideas and methods from other martial arts.\nHistory.\nImre \"Imi\" Lichtenfeld (also known as Imi S'de-Or) was born in 1910 in Budapest, Austro-Hungary to a Jewish family and grew up in Pozsony, today's Bratislava (Slovakia). Lichtenfeld became active in a wide range of sports, including gymnastics, wrestling, and boxing. In 1928, Lichtenfeld won the Slovak Youth Wrestling Championship, and in 1929 the adult championship (light and middle weight divisions). That same year, he also won the national boxing championship and an international gymnastics championship. During the ensuing decade, Lichtenfeld's athletic activities focused mainly on wrestling, both as a contestant and a trainer.\nIn the mid-1930s, antisemitic riots began to threaten the Jews of Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. Lichtenfeld became the leader of a group of Jewish boxers and wrestlers who took to the streets to defend Jewish neighborhoods against the growing numbers of antisemitic Nazis. Lichtenfeld quickly discovered, however, that actual fighting was very different from competition fighting, and although boxing and wrestling were good sports, they were not always practical for the aggressive and brutal nature of street combat. It was then that he started to re-evaluate his ideas about fighting and started developing the skills and techniques that would eventually become Krav Maga. Having become a thorn in the side of the equally antisemitic local authorities, in 1940 Lichtenfeld left his home with his family and friends on the last refugee ship to escape Europe.\nAfter making his way to Mandatory Palestine, Lichtenfeld joined the Haganah paramilitary organization. In 1944, Lichtenfeld began training fighters in his areas of expertise: physical fitness, swimming, wrestling, use of the knife, and defense against knife attacks. During this period, Lichtenfeld trained several elite units of the Haganah, including the Palmach (striking force of the Haganah and forerunner of the special units of the Israel Defense Forces) and the Palyam, as well as groups of police officers.\nIn 1948, when the State of Israel was founded and the IDF was formed, Lichtenfeld became Chief Instructor for Physical Fitness and Krav Maga at the IDF School of Combat Fitness. He served in the IDF for about 20 years, during which time he developed and refined his unique method for self-defense and hand-to-hand combat. Self-defense was not a new concept, since nearly all martial arts had developed some form of defensive techniques in their quest for tournament or sport dominance. However, self-defense was based strictly upon the scientific and dynamic principles of the human body. In 1965 judo training was added as part of the Krav Maga training. Until 1968 there were no grades in Krav Maga. Then a trainee's grades were determined largely by his knowledge in judo.\nIn 1968, Eli Avikzar, one of Lichtenfeld's principal students and first black belt, began learning aikido. In 1971, Eli left for France, where he received a black belt in aikido. Upon his return, Avikzar started working as an instructor alongside Imi to integrate more traditional martial arts into Krav Maga. Then in 1974 Imre retired and gave Eli Avikzar control over the Krav Maga training center in Netanya. Shortly after, in 1976, Avikzar joined the permanent force of IDF, as head of the Krav Maga section. The role of Krav Maga in the army advanced greatly after Eli's appointment. More courses were given, and every P.E. instructor was obliged to learn Krav Maga. Avikzar continued to develop Krav Maga within the IDF until his retirement in 1987. Up to this date, Eli had trained 80,000 male soldiers and 12,000 female soldiers.\nFurther pursuing excellence as a student of martial arts, Eli went to Germany in 1977 and received a black belt in aikido from the European Federation. In 1978, the Krav Maga association was established, and in 1989, as an active member of the judo association, Eli Avikzar helped to contribute to the general development of professional and rank committees within the larger Krav Maga community by founding the Israeli Krav Magen Association (KAMI). KAMI is a parallel discipline to the original Krav Maga. Eli retired as the Chief Krav Maga instructor in 1987 and Boaz Aviram became the third person to hold the position, being the last head instructor to have studied directly with both Lichtenfeld and Avikzar.\nIsrael Defense Forces.\nThe IDF offers a five-week Krav Maga instructor course. It has held an annual Krav Maga competition since May 2013.\nCivilian use.\nUpon Imi Lichtenfeld's retirement from the IDF, he decided to open a school and teach Krav Maga to civilians.\nThe first Krav Maga course took place at the Wingate Institute, Netanya, Israel, in 1971, under his direct supervision.\nGrading system.\nMost of the Krav Maga organizations in Israel use Imi Lichtenfeld's colored belt grading system which is based upon the Judo ranking system. It starts with a white belt, and then yellow, orange, green, blue, brown and black belts. Black belt students can move up the ranks from 1st to 9th Dan. The time and requirements for advancing have some differences between the organizations.\nOther organizations that teach Krav Maga in and outside of Israel use similar grading systems.\nA patch system was developed by Eyal Yanilov in the late 1980s. The grades are divided into three main categories: Practitioner, Graduate and Expert. Each of the categories, which are often abbreviated to their initials, has five ranks. Grades P1 through to P5 are the student levels and make up the majority of the Krav Maga community. After P5 are G1\u2013G5, and in order to achieve Graduate level the student has to demonstrate a proficiency in all of the P-level techniques before advancing.\nAlthough there are some subtle differences, the various organizations teach the same core techniques and principles. Some other organizations have less formal grading ranks without belts or patches but do have levels by which students can monitor their progress.\nSparring.\nIn some organizations, sparring is slow and light until the student reaches G2 level. This takes approximately four to six years, because rising one level in the Practitioner and Graduate categories takes at minimum half a year of consistent training. It is, however, more common to observe regular trainees grading only once a year from P3 and up.\nOnce in G2, students also practice simulated \"real\" fighting with protective gear.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It debuted on December 12, 1897, in the \"American Humorist\", the Sunday supplement of William Randolph Hearst's \"New York Journal\". The comic strip was turned into a stage play in 1903. It inspired several animated cartoons and was one of 20 strips included in the Comic Strip Classics series of American commemorative postage stamps.\nAfter a series of legal battles between 1912 and 1914, Dirks left the Hearst organization and began a new strip, first titled Hans and Fritz and then The Captain and the Kids. It featured the same characters seen in \"The Katzenjammer Kids\", which was continued by Knerr. The two separate versions of the strip competed with each other until 1979, when \"The Captain and the Kids\" ended its six-decade run. \"The Katzenjammer Kids\" published its last original strip in 2006, but is still distributed in reprints by King Features Syndicate, making it the oldest comic strip still in syndication and the longest-running ever.\nHistory.\nCreation and early years.\n\"The Katzenjammer Kids\" was inspired by \"Max and Moritz\", a children's story of the 1860s by German author Wilhelm Busch.\n\"Katzenjammer\" translates literally as \"the wailing of cats\" - i.e. \"caterwaul\". However, it is also used to mean \"contrition after a failed endeavor\" or \"hangover\" in German (and, in the latter sense, in English too). Whereas Max &amp; Moritz were grotesquely but comically put to death after seven destructive pranks, the Katzenjammer Kids and the other characters still thrive.\nDirks and Knerr.\n\"The Katzenjammer Kids\" was so popular that it became two competing comic strips and the subject of a lawsuit. This happened because Dirks, in 1912, wanted to take a break after drawing the strip for 15 years, but the Hearst newspaper syndicate would not allow it. Dirks left anyway, and the strip was taken over by Harold Knerr. Dirks' last strip appeared March 16, 1913. Various ghost artists then apparently did the strip for a few months. Dirks sued, and after a long legal battle, the Hearst papers were allowed to continue \"The Katzenjammer Kids\", with Knerr as writer and artist. He took over permanently in the summer of 1914, but Dirks was allowed to create an almost identical strip of his own for the rival Pulitzer newspapers, although he had to use a different name for the strip.\n\"The Captain and the Kids\".\nInitially named \"Hans und Fritz\" after the two naughty protagonist brothers, Dirks' new feature debuted on June 7, 1914. It was called \"The Captain and the Kids\" from 1918 on. \"The Captain and the Kids\" was very similar to \"The Katzenjammer Kids\" in terms of content and characters, but Dirks had a looser and more verbal style than Knerr, who on the other hand often produced stronger, more direct gags and drawings. \"The Captain and the Kids\" soon proved equal in popularity to \"The Katzenjammer Kids\". It was later distributed by the United Feature Syndicate, while Hearst's King Features distributed \"The Katzenjammer Kids\".\n1950s to the present.\n\"The Captain and the Kids\" expanded as a daily strip during the 1930s, but it had only a short run. However, the Sunday strip remained popular for decades. From 1946, Dirks' son, John Dirks, gradually began doing more of the work on \"The Captain and the Kids\". They introduced new characters and plots during the 1950s, including a 1958 science fiction storyline about a brilliant inventor and alien invasions. Even as John Dirks took over most of the work, Rudolph Dirks signed the strip until his death in 1968. John Dirks' drawing shifted slightly towards a more square-formed line, though it maintained the original style until \"The Captain and the Kids\" ended its run in 1979.\nKnerr continued drawing \"The Katzenjammer Kids\" until his death in 1949; the strip was then written and drawn by C.H. \"Doc\" Winner (1949\u20131956), with Joe Musial taking over in 1956. Musial was replaced on \"The Katzenjammer Kids\" by Mike Senich (1976\u20131981), Angelo DeCesare (1981\u20131986), and Hy Eisman (1986\u20132006). Now syndicated in reprint form, the strip is distributed internationally to some 50 newspapers and magazines. Eisman reused a lot of old gags and stories in later years.\nCharacters and story.\n\"The Katzenjammer Kids\" (three brothers in the first strip but soon reduced to two) featured Hans and Fritz, twins who rebelled against authority, particularly in the form of their mother, Mama; der Captain, a sailor who acted as a surrogate father; and der Inspector, a long-bearded school official. Other characters included John Silver, a pirate sea captain; the Herring Brothers, John Silver's three-man crew; and King Bongo, a primitive-living but sophisticated-acting Black jungle monarch who ruled a tropical island.\nAs originally created, Mama's husband was Papa Katzenjammer, her brother was the bungling sailor Heinie, and der Captain\u2013introduced in 1902\u2014was Heinie's boss. After a short while, Papa was dropped from the strip without explanation, with der Captain taking over his function. By the 1940s, der Captain and Mama were often presented as a de facto couple.\nThe immediate Katzenjammer family usually spoke stereotypical German-accented English. When first introduced, der Captain and der Inspector did not, but within months adopted the accent as well. During World Wars I and II, when the United States was at war with Germany, the Katzenjammer family were temporarily presented as Dutch.\nThe defining theme of the strip was Hans and Fritz pranking der Captain, der Inspector, Mama, or all three, for which the boys were often spanked, but sometimes shifted the blame to others. Other stories involved der Captain taking the Katzenjammers on treasure hunts or cargo voyages, sometimes aided by or competing with John Silver. Still other stories involved King Bongo enlisting the Katzenjammers to run errands or go on missions related to his kingdom; in both strips, by the mid-1930s, the family lived on Bongo's island\u2014usually called Squee-Jee\u2014and were readily at hand.\nKnerr's version of \"The Katzenjammer Kids\" introduced several major new characters in the 1930s. Miss Twiddle, a pompous tutor, and her brainy niece Lena came to stay permanently with the Katzenjammers in early 1936. Later in the year, Twiddle's ex-pupil, \"boy prodigy\" Rollo Rhubarb joined them. The ever-smug Rollo is always trying to outwit Hans and Fritz, but his cunning plans often backfire.\n\"The Captain and the Kids\" also introduced some new characters. Ginga Dun is a snooty Indian trader who can outsmart almost anyone and talks only in verse. Captain Bloodshot is a pint-sized pirate rival of John Silver.\nNotable features of the later strips, at both syndicates, included a more constructive relationship between the Captain and the boys, who sometimes bickered like friendly rivals rather than pranking each other outright. The King and his people, also in both strips, were now Polynesian rather than African.\nIn other media.\n\"The Katzenjammer Kids\".\nLive-action films.\nThe \"Katzenjammer Kids\" characters initially appeared outside comics in two live-action silent films. The first film, titled \"The Katzenjammer Kids in School\" released in 1898, was made for the Biograph Company by William George Bitzer. The second film, titled \"The Katzenjammer Kids in Love\", was released in 1900.\nTheatrical animated shorts.\nBetween December 1916 and August 1918, a total of 37 \"Katzenjammer Kids\" silent cartoon shorts were produced by William Randolph Hearst's own cartoon studio International Film Service, which adapted Hearst's well-known comic strips. The series was retired in 1918 at the height of the characters' popularity \u2013 partly because of the growing tension against titles with German associations after World War I. The comic strip was briefly renamed \"The Shenanigan Kids\" around this time, and in 1920 another five cartoons were produced under this title. All \"Katzenjammer Kids\"/\"Shenanigan Kids\" cartoons from International Film Services were directed (and most likely also animated) by Gregory La Cava. The series was transferred and continued by Bray Productions in 1920.\nTelevision.\nThe Katzenjammer Kids also appeared (along with other King Features comic-strip stars) in Hal Seeger's TV special \"Popeye Meets the Man Who Hated Laughter\" (1972).\n\"The Captain and the Kids\".\nTheatrical animated shorts.\nIn 1938, \"The Captain and the Kids\" became the subject of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's first self-produced series of theatrical short subject cartoons, directed by William Hanna, Bob Allen and Friz Freleng. Unlike the strip, which focused most of all on the gruesomely amusing antics of Hans and Fritz, the MGM cartoons often centered on the Captain. The series was overall unsuccessful, ending after one year and a total of 15 cartoons. Following that cancellation, Freleng returned to Warner Bros., where he had earlier been an animation director. The Captain was voiced by Billy Bletcher, Mama was voiced by Martha Wentworth, and John Silver was voiced by Mel Blanc.\nTelevision.\n\"The Captain and the Kids\" version of the strip was also animated for television as a segment on Filmation's \"Archie's TV Funnies\" in 1971, and in the spin-off series \"Fabulous Funnies\" from 1978 to 1979.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16803", "revid": "712163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16803", "title": "Ketone", "text": "Organic compounds of the form &gt;C=O\nIn organic chemistry, a ketone is an organic compound with the structure , where R and R' can be a variety of carbon-containing substituents. Ketones contain a carbonyl group (a carbon-oxygen double bond C=O). A ketone derived from an alkane is an alkanone. The simplest ketone is acetone (where R and R' are methyl), with the formula . Many ketones are of great importance in biology and industry. Examples include many sugars (ketoses), many steroids, e.g., testosterone, and the solvent acetone.\nNomenclature and etymology.\nThe word \"ketone\" is derived from \"Aketon\", an old German word for \"acetone\".\nAccording to the rules of IUPAC nomenclature, ketone names are derived by changing the suffix \"-ane\" of the parent alkane to \"-anone\". Typically, the position of the carbonyl group is denoted by a number, but traditional nonsystematic names are still generally used for the most important ketones, for example acetone and benzophenone. These nonsystematic names are considered retained IUPAC names, although some introductory chemistry textbooks use systematic names such as \"2-propanone\" or \"propan-2-one\" for the simplest ketone () instead of \"acetone\".\nThe derived names of ketones are obtained by writing separately the names of the two alkyl groups attached to the carbonyl group, followed by \"ketone\" as a separate word. Traditionally the names of the alkyl groups were written in order of increasing complexity, for example methyl ethyl ketone. However, according to the rules of IUPAC nomenclature, the alkyl groups are written alphabetically, for example ethyl methyl ketone. When the two alkyl groups are the same, the prefix \"di-\" is added before the name of alkyl group. The positions of other groups are indicated by Greek letters, the \u03b1-carbon being the atom adjacent to carbonyl group.\nAlthough used infrequently, \"oxo\" is the IUPAC nomenclature for the oxo group (=O) and used as prefix when the ketone does not have the highest priority. Other prefixes, however, are also used. For some common chemicals (mainly in biochemistry), \"keto\" refer to the ketone functional group.\nStructure and bonding.\nThe ketone carbon is often described as sp2 hybridized, a description that includes both their electronic and molecular structure. Ketones are trigonal planar around the ketonic carbon, with C\u2013C\u2013O and C\u2013C\u2013C bond angles of approximately 120\u00b0. Ketones differ from aldehydes in that the carbonyl group (C=O) is bonded to two carbons within a carbon skeleton. In aldehydes, the carbonyl is bonded to one carbon and one hydrogen and are located at the ends of carbon chains. Ketones are also distinct from other carbonyl-containing functional groups, such as carboxylic acids, esters and amides.\nThe carbonyl group is polar because the electronegativity of the oxygen is greater than that for carbon. Thus, ketones are nucleophilic at oxygen and electrophilic at carbon. Because the carbonyl group interacts with water by hydrogen bonding, ketones are typically more soluble in water than the related methylene compounds. Ketones are hydrogen-bond acceptors. Ketones are not usually hydrogen-bond donors and cannot hydrogen-bond to themselves. Because of their inability to serve both as hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors, ketones tend not to \"self-associate\" and are more volatile than alcohols and carboxylic acids of comparable molecular weights. These factors relate to the pervasiveness of ketones in perfumery and as solvents.\nClasses of ketones.\nKetones are classified on the basis of their substituents. One broad classification subdivides ketones into symmetrical and unsymmetrical derivatives, depending on the equivalency of the two organic substituents attached to the carbonyl center. Acetone and benzophenone () are symmetrical ketones. Acetophenone is an unsymmetrical ketone.\nDiketones.\nMany kinds of diketones are known, some with unusual properties. The simplest is diacetyl , once used as butter-flavoring in popcorn. Acetylacetone (pentane-2,4-dione) is virtually a misnomer (inappropriate name) because this species exists mainly as the monoenol . Its enolate is a common ligand in coordination chemistry.\nUnsaturated ketones.\nKetones containing alkene and alkyne units are often called unsaturated ketones. A widely used member of this class of compounds is methyl vinyl ketone, , a \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\nCyclic ketones.\nMany ketones are cyclic. The simplest class have the formula , where \"n\" varies from 2 for cyclopropanone () to the tens. Larger derivatives exist. Cyclohexanone (), a symmetrical cyclic ketone, is an important intermediate in the production of nylon. Isophorone, derived from acetone, is an unsaturated, asymmetrical ketone that is the precursor to other polymers. Muscone, 3-methylpentadecanone, is an animal pheromone. Another cyclic ketone is cyclobutanone, having the formula .\nCharacterization.\nAn aldehyde differs from a ketone in that it has a hydrogen atom attached to its carbonyl group, making aldehydes easier to oxidize. Ketones do not have a hydrogen atom bonded to the carbonyl group, and are therefore more resistant to oxidation. They are oxidized only by powerful oxidizing agents which have the ability to cleave carbon\u2013carbon bonds.\nSpectroscopy.\nKetones (and aldehydes) absorb strongly in the infra-red spectrum near 1750 cm\u22121, which is assigned to \u03bdC=O (\"carbonyl stretching frequency\"). The energy of the peak is lower for aryl and unsaturated ketones.\nWhereas 1H NMR spectroscopy is generally not useful for establishing the presence of a ketone, 13C NMR spectra exhibit signals somewhat downfield of 200 ppm depending on structure. Such signals are typically weak due to the absence of nuclear Overhauser effects. Since aldehydes resonate at similar chemical shifts, multiple resonance experiments are employed to definitively distinguish aldehydes and ketones.\nQualitative organic tests.\nKetones give positive results in Brady's test, the reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to give the corresponding hydrazone. Ketones may be distinguished from aldehydes by giving a negative result with Tollens' reagent or with Fehling's solution. Methyl ketones give positive results for the iodoform test. Ketones also give positive results when treated with \"m\"-dinitrobenzene in presence of dilute sodium hydroxide to give violet coloration.\nSynthesis.\nMany methods exist for the preparation of ketones in industrial scale and academic laboratories. Ketones are also produced in various ways by organisms; see the section on biochemistry below.\nIn industry, the most important method probably involves oxidation of hydrocarbons, often with air. For example, a billion kilograms of cyclohexanone are produced annually by aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane. Acetone is prepared by air-oxidation of cumene.\nFor specialized or small scale organic synthetic applications, ketones are often prepared by oxidation of secondary alcohols:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTypical strong oxidants (source of \"O\" in the above reaction) include potassium permanganate or a Cr(VI) compound. Milder conditions make use of the Dess\u2013Martin periodinane or the Moffatt\u2013Swern methods.\nMany other methods have been developed, examples include:\nReactions.\nKeto-enol tautomerization.\nKetones that have at least one alpha-hydrogen, undergo keto-enol tautomerization; the tautomer is an enol. Tautomerization is catalyzed by both acids and bases. Usually, the keto form is more stable than the enol. This equilibrium allows ketones to be prepared via the hydration of alkynes.\nAcid/base properties of ketones.\n bonds adjacent to the carbonyl in ketones are more acidic p\"K\"a\u00a0\u2248\u00a020) than the bonds in alkane (p\"K\"a\u00a0\u2248\u00a050). This difference reflects resonance stabilization of the enolate ion that is formed upon deprotonation. The relative acidity of the \u03b1-hydrogen is important in the enolization reactions of ketones and other carbonyl compounds. The acidity of the \u03b1-hydrogen also allows ketones and other carbonyl compounds to react as nucleophiles at that position, with either stoichiometric and catalytic base. Using very strong bases like lithium diisopropylamide (LDA, p\"K\"a of conjugate acid ~36) under non-equilibrating conditions (\u201378\u00a0\u00b0C, 1.1 equiv LDA in THF, ketone added to base), the less-substituted \"kinetic\" \"enolate\" is generated selectively, while conditions that allow for equilibration (higher temperature, base added to ketone, using weak or insoluble bases, e.g., in , or NaH) provides the more-substituted \"thermodynamic enolate\".\nKetones are also weak bases, undergoing protonation on the carbonyl oxygen in the presence of Br\u00f8nsted acids. Ketonium ions (i.e., protonated ketones) are strong acids, with p\"K\"a values estimated to be somewhere between \u20135 and \u20137. Although acids encountered in organic chemistry are seldom strong enough to fully protonate ketones, the formation of equilibrium concentrations of protonated ketones is nevertheless an important step in the mechanisms of many common organic reactions, like the formation of an acetal, for example. Acids as weak as pyridinium cation (as found in pyridinium tosylate) with a p\"K\"a of 5.2 are able to serve as catalysts in this context, despite the highly unfavorable equilibrium constant for protonation (\"K\"eq\u00a0&lt;\u00a010\u221210).\nNucleophilic additions.\nAn important set of reactions follow from the susceptibility of the carbonyl carbon toward nucleophilic addition and the tendency for the enolates to add to electrophiles.\nNucleophilic additions include in approximate order of their generality:\nOxidation.\nKetones are cleaved by strong oxidizing agents and at elevated temperatures. Their oxidation involves carbon\u2013carbon bond cleavage to afford a mixture of carboxylic acids having lesser number of carbon atoms than the parent ketone. \nBiochemistry.\nKetones do not appear in standard amino acids, nucleic acids, nor lipids. The formation of organic compounds in photosynthesis occurs via the ketone ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. Many sugars are ketones, known collectively as ketoses. The best known ketose is fructose; it mostly exists as a cyclic hemiketal, which masks the ketone functional group. Fatty acid synthesis proceeds via ketones. Acetoacetate is an intermediate in the Krebs cycle which releases energy from sugars and carbohydrates.\nIn medicine, acetone, acetoacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate are collectively called ketone bodies, generated from carbohydrates, fatty acids, and amino acids in most vertebrates, including humans. Ketone bodies are elevated in the blood (ketosis) after fasting, including a night of sleep; in both blood and urine in starvation; in hypoglycemia, due to causes other than hyperinsulinism; in various inborn errors of metabolism, and intentionally induced via a ketogenic diet, and in ketoacidosis (usually due to diabetes mellitus). Although ketoacidosis is characteristic of decompensated or untreated type 1 diabetes, ketosis or even ketoacidosis can occur in type 2 diabetes in some circumstances as well.\nApplications.\nKetones are produced on massive scales in industry as solvents, polymer precursors, and pharmaceuticals. In terms of scale, the most important ketones are acetone, methylethyl ketone, and cyclohexanone. They are also common in biochemistry, but less so than in organic chemistry in general. The combustion of hydrocarbons is an uncontrolled oxidation process that gives ketones as well as many other types of compounds.\nToxicity.\nAlthough it is difficult to generalize on the toxicity of such a broad class of compounds, simple ketones are, in general, not highly toxic. This characteristic is one reason for their popularity as solvents. Exceptions to this rule are the unsaturated ketones such as methyl vinyl ketone with LD50 of 7\u00a0mg/kg (oral).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name may also refer to the specific compound ethenone , the simplest ketene.\nAlthough they are highly useful, most ketenes are unstable. When used as reagents in a chemical procedure, they are typically generated when needed, and consumed as soon as (or while) they are produced.\nHistory.\nKetenes were first studied as a class by Hermann Staudinger before 1905.\nKetenes were systematically investigated by Hermann Staudinger in 1905 in the form of diphenylketene (conversion of formula_1-chlorodiphenyl acetyl chloride with zinc). Staudinger was inspired by the first examples of reactive organic intermediates and stable radicals discovered by Moses Gomberg in 1900 (compounds with triphenylmethyl group).\nProperties.\nKetenes are highly electrophilic at the carbon atom bonded with the heteroatom, due to its \"sp\" character. Ketenes can be formed with different heteroatoms bonded to the \"sp\" carbon atom, such as O, S or Se, respectively called ketenes, thioketenes and selenoketenes.\nEthenone, the simplest ketene, has different experimental lengths for each of its double bonds; the C=O bond is 1.160 \u00c5 and the C=C bond is 1.314 \u00c5. The angle between the two H atoms is 121.5\u00b0, similar to the theoretically ideal angle in alkenes between \"sp2 \"carbon atoms and H substituents.\nKetenes are unstable and cannot be stored. Absent nucleophiles with which to react, they dimerise (see ). \nSynthesis.\nEthenone is produced on a commercial scale by thermal dehydration of acetic acid. Substituted ketenes can be prepared from acyl chlorides by an elimination reaction in which HCl is lost:\nIn this reaction, a base, usually triethylamine, removes the acidic proton alpha to the carbonyl group, inducing the formation of the carbon-carbon double bond and the loss of a chloride ion:\nKetenes can also be formed from \u03b1-diazoketones by the Wolff rearrangement, and from vinylene carbonate by phosphorus(V) sulfide and irradiation.\nAnother way to generate ketenes is through flash vacuum thermolysis (FVT) with 2-pyridylamines. Pl\u00fcg and Wentrup developed a method in 1997 that improved on FVT reactions to produce ketenes with a stable FVT that is moisture insensitive, using mild conditions (480\u00a0\u00b0C). The N-pyridylamines are prepared via a condensation with R-malonates with N-amino(pyridene) and DCC as the solvent.\nA more robust method for preparing ketenes is the carbonylation of metal-carbenes, and \"in situ\" reaction of the thus produced highly reactive ketenes with suitable reagents such as imines, amines, or alcohols. This method is an efficient one\u2010pot tandem protocol of the carbonylation of \u03b1\u2010diazocarbonyl compounds and a variety of \"N\"\u2010tosylhydrazones catalysed by Co(II)\u2013porphyrin metalloradicals leading to the formation of ketenes, which subsequently react with a variety of nucleophiles and imines to form esters, amides and \u03b2\u2010lactams. This system has a broad substrate scope and can be applied to various combinations of carbene precursors, nucleophiles and imines.\nEthenone can be produced through pyrolysis of acetone vapours over a hot filament in an apparatus that was eventually developed into the \"ketene lamp\" or \"Hurd lamp\" (named for Charles D. Hurd).\nReactions.\nDue to their cumulated double bonds, ketenes are very reactive. The free energy released in their saturation can power the formation of relatively strained rings. \nAcylation.\nKetenes are strong acylating agents. They react with carboxylic acids to form carboxylic acid anhydrides...\n...with alcohols to form carboxylic acid esters...\n...with amines to give amides...\n...with water to give carboxylic acids...\n...and with enolisable carbonyl compounds to give enol esters. For example, ethenone reacts with acetone to form a propen-2-yl acetate:\nCycloadditions.\nAs first observed in 1908, \nketenes react with virtually any electron-rich \u03c0 bond to form 4-membered rings. \nFor example, in the Staudinger synthesis, a ketene attacks an imine to form a \u03b2-lactam:\nKetenes also cyclize onto enolic and enaminic \nalkenes, carbodiimides, and electron-rich alkynes (the latter forming cyclobutenones). \n\"cis\" Alkenes react more easily than \"trans\" alkenes. \nElectron-withdrawing substituents on the ketene accelerate the\nreaction, but disubstituted ketenes react slowly due to steric hindrance. \nKetenes attack ketones and aldehydes to give \u03b2-lactones, but only under Lewis acid\ncatalysis or when the carbonyl is electron-impoverished:\nDienes generally react as two separate alkenes,\nand fulvenes typically react in the ring, leaving the exocyclic double bond intact:\nStereochemistry.\n[2+2] cycloadditions proceed by a concerted, thermal mechanism, which requires suprafacial-\nantarafacial alignment. Ketenes, unlike most alkenes, can align antarafacially with respect to other alkenes. The unique transition state geometry has the interesting consequence that the bulkier substituent on the ketene will tend\nto end up on the more sterically hindered face of the cyclobutanone ring. In the transition state for cyclization, the small substituent points toward the alkene. \nKetenes place the larger substituent in the \"endo\" position when attacking cyclic alkenes. \nThe use of chiral amine catalysts has allowed access to cycloaddition products in high enantiomeric excess.\nHigher-length cycloadditions.\nIn rarer cases, ketenes may undergo [3+2], and [4+2] cycloadditions.\n[3+2] Cycloadditions may take place with 1,3-dipoles. This process appears to be concerted, but\neither ketenic double-bond can react.\nMichael acceptors often react in a\n[4+2] fashion:\nConjugated ketenes may act as 4\u03c0 partners in [4+2] cycloadditions as well. \nExamples in which a vinylketene serves as the 4\u03c0 partner are rare, but occur with some ketene-conjugated\nheterodienes:\nDimerization.\nKetenes autodimerize to give various products. The parent reacts acylates itself to form diketene, a \u03b2-lactone, whereas disubstituted ketenes undergo [2+2] cycloaddition to a substituted cyclobutadione:\nMonosubstituted ketenes can afford either the ester or diketone dimer.\nAlthough many polar solvents and catalysts accelerate many reactions using ketene, such reactions are normally performed in nonpolar media to prevent dimerization. \nApplications.\nDimerization of stearic ketene affords alkyl ketene dimers, widely used in the paper industry. AKD's react with the hydroxyl groups on the cellulose via esterification reaction. \nLikewise, diols () and bis-ketenes () react to yield polyesters with a repeat unit of (). \nThe Staudinger synthesis is used to synthesize \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. \nEthyl acetoacetate, an organic synthesis feedstock, is prepared industrially from diketene in ethanol. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many of his novels and stories have ecological, cultural, and political themes, featuring scientists as heroes. Robinson has won numerous awards, including the Hugo Award for Best Novel, the Nebula Award for Best Novel, and the World Fantasy Award. \"The Atlantic\" magazine has called Robinson's work \"the gold standard of realistic, and highly literary, science-fiction writing.\" According to an article in \"The New Yorker\" magazine, Robinson is \"generally acknowledged as one of the greatest living science-fiction writers.\"\nEarly life and education.\nRobinson was born in Waukegan, Illinois. He moved to Southern California as a child.\nIn 1974, he earned a BA in literature from the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego). In 1975, he earned an MA in English from Boston University. In 1978, Robinson moved to Davis, California, to take a break from graduate studies at UC San Diego. During this period, he worked as a bookseller for Orpheus Books. He also taught freshman composition and other courses at the University of California, Davis.\nIn 1982, Robinson earned a PhD in English from UC San Diego. His original PhD advisor was literary critic and Marxist scholar Fredric Jameson, who had pointed Robinson toward works by science fiction author Philip K. Dick. Jameson described Dick to his student as \"the greatest living American writer\". Jameson moved to the University of California, Santa Cruz (UC Santa Cruz), so Robinson finished his doctoral thesis under the scholar Donald Wesling. Robinson's dissertation was titled \"The Novels of Philip K. Dick\".\nCareer.\nIn 2009, Robinson was an instructor at the Clarion Workshop for science fiction and fantasy writing. In 2010, he was the guest of honor at the 68th World Science Fiction Convention, held in Melbourne. In April 2011, Robinson presented at the second annual Rethinking Capitalism conference, held at UC Santa Cruz. Among other topics, his talk addressed the cyclical nature of capitalism.\nRobinson was appointed as a Muir Environmental Fellow in 2011 by John Muir College at UC San Diego.\nMajor themes.\nNature and culture.\nThe artist Sheldon Brown described Robinson's novels as ways to explore how nature and culture continuously reformulate one another:\nEcological sustainability.\nVirtually all of Robinson's novels have an ecological component; sustainability is one of his primary themes. (A strong contender for the primary theme would be the nature of a plausible utopia.) The \"Orange County\" trilogy is about how the technological realm intersects with the natural realm, highlighting the importance of keeping the two in balance. In the \"Mars\" trilogy, one of the principal divisions among the Mars population arises from dissenting views on terraforming. Colonists debate whether the barren Martian landscape has a similar ecological or spiritual value when compared with a living ecosphere such as Earth's. The novel \"Forty Signs of Rain\" has an entirely ecological thrust, taking global warming as its principal subject.\nEconomic and social justice.\nRobinson's work often explores alternatives to modern capitalism. In the \"Mars\" trilogy, it is argued that capitalism is an outgrowth of feudalism, which could be replaced in the future by a more democratic economic system. Worker ownership and cooperatives figure prominently in the novels \"Green Mars\" and \"Blue Mars\" as replacements for traditional corporations. The \"Orange County\" trilogy explores similar arrangements; \"Pacific Edge\" includes the idea of attacking the legal framework behind corporate domination to promote social egalitarianism. Tim Kreider writes in the \"New Yorker\" magazine that Robinson may be the greatest American political novelist, and he describes how Robinson uses the \"Mars\" trilogy as a template for a credible utopia. His works have referred to real-world examples of economic organization that have been mentioned as alternatives to conventional capitalist structures; these examples include the Mondragon Corporation and the Kerala model.\nRobinson's writing also reflects an interest in economic models of degrowth (which rejects the growth-oriented basis of capitalism). Robert Markley has identified the work of the social theorist Murray Bookchin as an influence on Robinson's thinking, in addition to steady-state economics.\nRobinson's work often portrays characters struggling to preserve and enhance the world around them, in an environment characterized by individualism and entrepreneurialism, often facing the political and economic authoritarianism of corporate power acting in this environment. Robinson has been described as anti-capitalist, and his work often portrays a form of frontier capitalism that promotes egalitarian ideals closely resembling socialist systems, but faced with a capitalism that is maintained by entrenched hegemonic corporations. In particular, his fictional Martian Constitution draws upon social democratic ideals explicitly emphasizing a community-participation element in political and economic life.\nRobinson's works often portray the worlds of tomorrow similarly to the mythologized American frontier (or Old West), showing a sentimental affection for the freedom and wildness of the frontier. This aesthetic includes a preoccupation with competing models of political and economic organization.\nThe environmental, economic, and social themes in Robinson's oeuvre stand in marked contrast to the right-libertarian science fiction prevalent in much of the genre. (Robert A. Heinlein, Poul Anderson, Larry Niven, and Jerry Pournelle offer prominent examples.) Robinson has been described as \"one of America's best-selling [\u2026] left-wing novelists\", and his work has been called \"probably the most successful attempt to reach a mass audience with an anti-capitalist utopian vision since Ursula K. Le Guin's 1974 novel, \"The Dispossessed\"\".\nScientists as heroes.\nRobinson's work often features scientists as heroes. They are portrayed in a mundane way compared to most work featuring scientists: rather than being adventurers or action heroes, Robinson's scientists become essential because of research discoveries; networking and collaboration with other scientists; political lobbying; or becoming public figures. Robinson captures the joy of scientists as they work on projects that they care about. Robert Markley has argued that Robinson \"views science as the model for a utopian politics... Even in Robinson's novels that don't seem to be sci-fi, like \"Shaman\", the inductive method, the collective search for greater knowledge about the world that can be put to use for the good for all, is front and center\". The \"Mars\" trilogy and the novel \"The Years of Rice and Salt\" rely heavily on the idea that scientists must take responsibility for ensuring public understanding and responsible use of their discoveries. Robinson's scientists often emerge as the best people to direct public policy on important environmental and technological questions, about which politicians are often ignorant.\nClimate change and global warming.\nOther themes in Robinson's work reflect his focus on the environment: the imminent catastrophe of global warming and the need to limit greenhouse gas emissions in the present day. His 2012 novel \"2312\" explores the detrimental, long-term effects of climate change, which include food shortages, global instability, mass extinction, and a sea level rise that has drowned many major coastal cities. The novel condemns the people of the period it calls \"the Dithering\", from 2005 to 2060, for failing to address climate change, thereby causing mass suffering and death in the future. Robinson and his work accuse global capitalism of a failure to address climate change. In his 2017 novel \"New York 2140\", Robinson explores the themes of climate change and global warming; the novel is set in the year 2140, when the New York City that he imagines is overwhelmed by a sea level rise that submerges half of the city. Climate change is also the focus of his \"Science in the Capital\" series and his 2020 novel \"The Ministry for the Future\".\nAwards and honors.\nThe asteroid 72432 Kimrobinson, discovered by astronomer Donald P. Pray in 2001, was named in Robinson's honor. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on April 22, 2016 (M.P.C. 99892).\nIn 2008, \"Time\" magazine named Robinson a \"Hero of the Environment\" for his optimistic focus on the future.\nPersonal life.\nRobinson and his wife have two sons. Robinson has lived in Washington, D.C.; California; and Switzerland (during some of the 1980s). At times, Robinson was a stay-at-home dad. He later moved to Davis, California, in a cohousing community.\nRobinson has described himself as an avid backpacker, with the Sierra Nevada mountains serving as his home range and a significant influence on his worldview.\nPolitically, Robinson identifies as a democratic socialist; in a February 2019 interview, he mentioned that he is a dues-paying member of the Democratic Socialists of America (an American political organization). He has also commented that libertarianism never \"[made] any sense to me, nor sounds attractive as a principle.\""}
{"id": "16808", "revid": "1461430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16808", "title": "King Arthur", "text": "Legendary king of the Britons\nKing Arthur (; ; ; ) was a legendary king of Britain. He is a folk hero and a central figure in the medieval literary tradition known as the Matter of Britain.\nIn Welsh sources, Arthur is portrayed as a leader of the post-Roman Britons in battles against the Anglo-Saxons in the late-5th and early-6th centuries. He first appears in two early medieval historical sources, the \"Annales Cambriae\" and the \"Historia Brittonum\", but these date to 300 years after he is supposed to have lived, and most historians who study the period do not consider him a historical figure. His name also occurs in early Welsh poetic sources, such as \"Y Gododdin\". The character developed through Welsh mythology, appearing either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, and was sometimes associated with the Welsh otherworld Annwn.\nThe legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" (\"History of the Kings of Britain\"). Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established a vast empire. Many elements and incidents that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey's \"Historia\", including Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, the magician Merlin, Arthur's wife Guinevere, the sword Excalibur, Arthur's conception at Tintagel, his final battle against Mordred at Camlann, and his final rest in Avalon. Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, the 12th-century French writer who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story, began the genre of Arthurian romance, which in turn became a significant strand of medieval literature. In these French stories, the narrative focus often shifts from King Arthur himself to other characters, such as various Knights of the Round Table. The themes, events and characters of the Arthurian legend vary widely from text to text, and there is no one canonical version. Arthurian literature thrived during the Middle Ages but waned in the following centuries until it experienced a major resurgence in the 19th century. In the 21st century the legend continues to have prominence, not only in literature but also in adaptations for theatre, film, television, comics and other media.\nHistoricity.\nKing Arthur was traditionally accepted as a historic person. He was originally thought to have been an ancient British war commander and, at least from the early 12th century, a king. There was, however, much discussion regarding his various deeds, and contemporary scholars and clerics generally refuted the popular medieval belief in his extreme longevity and future return. From the eighteenth century onwards, there has been academic debate about the historicity of Arthur. Details of Arthur's story are mainly composed of Welsh mythology, English folklore and literary invention, and most modern historians writing about the period do not think that he was a historical figure.\nOne school of thought, citing entries in the \"Historia Brittonum\" (\"History of the Britons\") and \"Annales Cambriae\" (\"Welsh Annals\"), saw Arthur as a genuine historical Romano-British leader who fought against the invading Anglo-Saxons sometime in the late-5th to early-6th century.\nThe \"Historia Brittonum\", a 9th-century Latin historical compilation attributed in some late manuscripts to a Welsh cleric called Nennius, contains the first datable mention of King Arthur, listing twelve battles that Arthur fought. These culminate in the Battle of Badon, where he is said to have single-handedly killed 960 men. Recent studies question the reliability of the \"Historia Brittonum\".\nArchaeological evidence in the Low Countries and what was to become England shows that early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, concurring with Frankish chronicles. John Davies notes this as consistent with the British victory at Badon Hill, attributed to Arthur by Nennius. The monks of Glastonbury are also said to have discovered the grave of Arthur in 1180.\nThe other text that seems to support the case for Arthur's historical existence is the 10th-century \"Annales Cambriae\", which also links Arthur with the Battle of Badon. The \"Annales\" date this battle to 516\u2013518 and also mention the Battle of Camlann, in which Arthur and Medraut (Mordred) were both killed, dated to 537\u2013539. These details have often been used to bolster confidence in the \"Historia\"'s account and confirm that Arthur fought at Badon.\nProblems have been identified, however, with using this source to support the \"Historia Brittonum\"'s account. The latest research shows that the \"Annales Cambriae\" was based on a chronicle begun in the late 8th century in Wales. Additionally, the complex textual history of the \"Annales Cambriae\" precludes any certainty that the Arthurian annals were added to it even that early. They were more likely added at some point in the 10th century and may never have existed in any earlier set of annals. The Badon entry probably derived from the \"Historia Brittonum\".\nThis lack of convincing early evidence is the reason many recent historians exclude Arthur from their accounts of sub-Roman Britain. In the view of the historian Thomas Charles-Edwards, \"At this stage of the enquiry, one can only say that there may well have been an historical Arthur [but ...] the historian can as yet say nothing of value about him\". These modern admissions of ignorance are a relatively recent trend; earlier generations of historians were less sceptical. The historian John Morris made the putative reign of Arthur the organising principle of his history of sub-Roman Britain and Ireland, \"The Age of Arthur\" (1973). Even so, he found little to say about a historical Arthur.\nPartly in reaction to such theories, another school of thought emerged, arguing that Arthur had no historical existence. Morris's \"Age of Arthur\" prompted the archaeologist Nowell Myres to observe that \"no figure on the borderline of history and mythology has wasted more of the historian's time\". Gildas's 6th-century polemic \"De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae\" (\"On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain\"), written within living memory of Badon, mentions the battle but does not mention Arthur. Arthur is not mentioned in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" or named in any surviving manuscript written between 400 and 820. He is absent from Bede's early-8th-century \"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\", another major early source for post-Roman history that mentions Badon; instead, Bede refers to Ambrosius Aurelianus as the leader of the Britons at that battle, whose parents had perished 'in the storm' and who was 'of the royal race'. The historian David Dumville wrote: \"I think we can dispose of him [Arthur] quite briefly. He owes his place in our history books to a 'no smoke without fire' school of thought\u00a0... The fact of the matter is that there is no historical evidence about Arthur; we must reject him from our histories and, above all, from the titles of our books.\"\nSome scholars argue that Arthur was originally a fictional hero of folklore\u2014or even a half-forgotten Celtic deity\u2014who became credited with real deeds in the distant past. They cite parallels with figures such as the Kentish Hengist and Horsa, who may be totemic horse-gods that later became historicised. Bede ascribed to these legendary figures a historical role in the 5th-century Anglo-Saxon conquest of eastern Britain. It is not even certain that Arthur was considered a king in the early texts. Neither the \"Historia\" nor the \"Annales\" calls him \"\"rex\": the former calls him instead \"dux bellorum\" (leader of wars) and \"miles\"\" (soldier).\nAndrew Breeze argues that Arthur was a historical character who fought other Britons in the area of the future border between England and Scotland and claims to have identified the locations of his battles as well as the place and date of his death (in the context of the extreme weather events of 535\u2013536), but his conclusions are disputed. Other scholars have questioned his findings, which they consider are based on coincidental resemblances between place-names. Nicholas Higham comments that it is difficult to justify identifying Arthur as the leader in northern battles listed in the \"Historia Brittonum\" while rejecting the implication in the same work that they were fought against Anglo-Saxons and that there is no textual justification for separating Badon from the other battles.\nSeveral historical figures have been proposed as the basis for Arthur, ranging from Lucius Artorius Castus, a Roman officer who served in Britain in the 2nd or 3rd century, to sub-Roman British rulers such as Riotamus, Ambrosius Aurelianus, and the Welsh kings Owain Ddantgwyn, Enniaun Girt and Athrwys ap Meurig. However, no convincing evidence for these identifications has emerged.\nName.\nThe origin of the Welsh name \"Arthur\" remains a matter of debate. The most widely accepted etymology derives it from the Roman \"nomen gentile\" (family name) Artorius. Artorius itself is of obscure and contested etymology. Linguist Stephan Zimmer suggests Artorius possibly had a Celtic origin, being a Latinization of a hypothetical name \"*Artor\u012bjos\", in turn derived from an older patronym\" *Arto-r\u012bg-ios\", meaning \"son of the bear/warrior-king\". This patronym is unattested, but the root, \"*arto-r\u012bg\", \"bear/warrior-king\", is the source of the Old Irish personal name \"Artr\u00ed\". Some scholars have suggested it is relevant to this debate that the legendary King Arthur's name only appears as \"Arthur\" or \"Arturus\" in early Latin Arthurian texts, never as \"Art\u014drius\" (though Classical Latin Art\u014drius became Arturius in some Vulgar Latin dialects). Others believe the origin of the name \"Arthur\", as \"Art\u014drius\" would regularly become \"Art(h)ur\" when borrowed into Welsh.\nAnother commonly proposed derivation of \"Arthur\" from Welsh \"arth\" \"bear\" + \"(g)wr\" \"man\" (earlier \"*Arto-uiros\" in Brittonic) is not accepted by modern scholars for phonological and orthographic reasons. Notably, a Brittonic compound name \"*Arto-uiros\" should produce Old Welsh \"*Artgur\" (where \"u\" represents the short vowel /u/) and Middle/Modern Welsh \"*Arthwr\", rather than \"Arthur\" (where \"u\" is a long vowel /\u0289\u02d0/). In Welsh poetry the name is always spelled \"Arthur\" and is exclusively rhymed with words ending in \"-ur\"\u2014never words ending in \"-wr\"\u2014which confirms that the second element cannot be \"[g]wr\" \"man\".\nAn alternative theory, which has gained only limited acceptance among professional scholars, derives the name Arthur from Arcturus, the brightest star in the constellation Bo\u00f6tes, near Ursa Major or the Great Bear. Classical Latin \"Arcturus\" would also have become \"Art(h)ur\" when borrowed into Welsh, and its brightness and position in the sky led people to regard it as the \"guardian of the bear\" (which is the meaning of the name in Ancient Greek) and the \"leader\" of the other stars in Bo\u00f6tes.\nMany other theories exist, for example that the name has Messapian or Etruscan origins.\nLegends concerning the return of Arthur.\nThat Arthur never died but is awaiting his return in some remote spot, often sleeping, is a central motif connected to the Arthurian legends. Before the twelfth century there are, as in the \"Englynion y Beddau\", references to the absence of a grave for Arthur suggesting that he was considered immortal and not dead, but in this poem there is no indication that he was expected to return. From the early twelfth century onwards several sources report a popular belief in the return of King Arthur, although most often critically and mockingly presented. His future return is first mentioned by William of Malmesbury in 1125: \"But Arthur's grave is nowhere seen, whence antiquity of fables still claims that he will return.\" The \"Miracles of St. Mary of Laon\" (\"De miraculis sanctae Mariae Laudunensis\"), written by a French cleric and chronicler named H\u00e9riman of Tournai about 1145, but referring to events occurring in 1113, mentions the Breton and Cornish belief that Arthur still lived.\nIn 1191 the alleged tomb of Arthur was identified in an orchestrated discovery at Glastonbury Abbey. Whereas numerous scholars have argued that this could have been due to the Abbey wanting to stand out with an illustrious tomb, or to a desire of the Plantagenet regime to put an end to a legendary rival figure who inspired tenacious Celtic opposition to their rule, it may also have been motivated by how the Arthurian expectations were highly problematic to contemporary Christianity. The longing of the return of a mighty immortal figure returning before the end of time to re-establish his perfect rule, not only ran against basic Catholic tenets but could even threaten the quintessential focus on the longing for the return of Jesus. This was further aggravated by how the stories about Arthur sometimes invoked more emotions than biblical tales. Decades of elite critique of the popular conviction among otherwise pious Catholic Celts in Britain and Brittany had done nothing to suppress these beliefs, whereas the orchestration of Arthur's physical remains effectively eliminated the possibility of his return without overtly criticizing anyone's beliefs. After the 1191 discovery of his alleged tomb, Arthur became more of a figure of folk legends, found sleeping in various remote caves all over Britain and some other places, and at times, roaming the night as a spectre, like in the Wild Hunt.\nMedieval literary traditions.\nThe familiar literary persona of Arthur began with Geoffrey of Monmouth's pseudo-historical \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" (\"History of the Kings of Britain\"), written in the 1130s. The textual sources for Arthur are usually divided into those written before Geoffrey's \"Historia\" (known as pre-Galfridian texts, from the Latin form of Geoffrey, \"Galfridus\") and those written afterwards, which could not avoid his influence (Galfridian, or post-Galfridian, texts).\nPre-Galfridian traditions.\nThe earliest literary references to Arthur come from Welsh and Breton sources. There have been few attempts to define the nature and character of Arthur in the pre-Galfridian tradition as a whole, rather than in a single text or text/story-type. A 2007 academic survey led by Caitlin Green has identified three key strands to the portrayal of Arthur in this earliest material. The first is that he was a peerless warrior who functioned as the monster-hunting protector of Britain from all internal and external threats. Some of these are human threats, such as the Saxons he fights in the \"Historia Brittonum\", but the majority are supernatural, including giant cat-monsters, destructive divine boars, dragons, dogheads, giants, and witches. The second is that the pre-Galfridian Arthur was a figure of folklore (particularly topographic or onomastic folklore) and localised magical wonder-tales, the leader of a band of superhuman heroes who live in the wilds of the landscape. The third and final strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a close connection with the Welsh Otherworld, Annwn. On the one hand, he launches assaults on Otherworldly fortresses in search of treasure and frees their prisoners. On the other, his warband in the earliest sources includes former pagan gods, and his wife and his possessions are clearly Otherworldly in origin.\nOne of the most famous Welsh poetic references to Arthur comes in the collection of heroic death-songs known as \"Y Gododdin\" (\"The Gododdin\"), attributed to the 6th-century poet Aneirin. One stanza from the oldest surviving manuscript praises the bravery of a warrior who slew 300 enemies, but says that despite this, \"he was no Arthur,\" i.e., his feats cannot compare to Arthur. \"Y Gododdin\" is known only from a 13th-century manuscript, so it is impossible to determine whether this passage is original or a later interpolation, but John Koch's view that the passage dates from a 7th-century or earlier version is regarded as unproven; 9th- or 10th-century dates are often proposed for it. Several poems attributed to Taliesin, a poet said to have lived in the 6th century, also refer to Arthur, although these all probably date from between the 8th and 12th centuries. They include \"Kadeir Teyrnon\" (\"The Chair of the Prince\"), which refers to \"Arthur the Blessed\"; \"Preiddeu Annwn\" (\"The Spoils of Annwn\"), which recounts an expedition of Arthur to the Otherworld; and \"Marwnat vthyr pen[dragon]\" (\"The Elegy of Uther Pen[dragon]\"), which refers to Arthur's valour and is suggestive of a father-son relationship for Arthur and Uther that pre-dates Geoffrey of Monmouth.\nOther early Welsh Arthurian texts include a poem found in the \"Black Book of Carmarthen\", \"Pa gur yv y porthaur?\" (\"What man is the gatekeeper?\"). This takes the form of a dialogue between Arthur and the gatekeeper of a fortress he wishes to enter, in which Arthur recounts the names and deeds of himself and his men, notably Cei (Kay) and Bedwyr (Bedivere).\nIn addition to these pre-Galfridian Welsh poems and tales, Arthur appears in some other early Latin texts besides the \"Historia Brittonum\" and the \"Annales Cambriae\". In particular, Arthur features in a number of well-known \"vitae\" (\"Lives\") of post-Roman saints, none of which are now generally considered to be reliable historical sources (the earliest probably dates from the 11th century). According to the \"Life of Saint Gildas\", written in the early-12th century by Caradoc of Llancarfan, Arthur is said to have killed Gildas's brother Hueil and to have rescued his wife Gwenhwyfar from Glastonbury. In the \"Life of Saint Cadoc\", written around 1100 or a little before by Lifris of Llancarfan, the saint gives protection to a man who killed three of Arthur's soldiers, and Arthur demands a herd of cattle as \"wergeld\" for his men. Cadoc delivers them as demanded, but when Arthur takes possession of the animals, they turn into bundles of ferns. Similar incidents are described in the medieval biographies of Carantoc, Padarn and Efflamn, probably written around the 12th century. A less legendary account of Arthur appears in the \"Legenda Sancti Goeznovii\", which is often claimed to date from the early-11th century (although the earliest manuscript of this text dates from the 15th century and the text is now dated to the late-12th to early-13th century). Also important are the references to Arthur in William of Malmesbury's \"De Gestis Regum Anglorum\" and Herman's \"De Miraculis Sanctae Mariae Laudunensis\", which together provide the first certain evidence for a belief that Arthur was not actually dead and would at some point return, a theme that is often revisited in post-Galfridian folklore.\nGeoffrey of Monmouth.\nGeoffrey of Monmouth's \"Historia Regum Britanniae\", completed c.\u20091138, contains the first narrative account of Arthur's life. This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader. Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do \"Historia Brittonum\" and \"Annales Cambriae\". According to Geoffrey's tale, Arthur was a descendant of Constantine the Great. He incorporates Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna (Igraine) at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the \"Historia Brittonum\", culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands. After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway, Denmark and Gaul. Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory leads to a further confrontation with Rome. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)\u2014whom he had left in charge of Britain\u2014has married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne. Arthur returns to Britain and defeats and kills Modredus on the river Camblam in Cornwall, but he is mortally wounded. He hands the crown to his kinsman Constantine and is taken to the isle of Avalon to be healed of his wounds, never to be seen again.\nHow much of this narrative was Geoffrey's own invention is open to debate. He seems to have made use of the list of Arthur's twelve battles against the Saxons found in the 9th-century \"Historia Brittonum\", along with the battle of Camlann from the \"Annales Cambriae\" and the idea that Arthur was still alive. Arthur's status as the king of all Britain seems to be borrowed from pre-Galfridian tradition, being found in \"Culhwch and Olwen\", the Welsh Triads, and the saints' lives. Finally, Geoffrey borrowed many of the names for Arthur's possessions, close family, and companions from the pre-Galfridian Welsh tradition, including Kaius (Cei), Beduerus (Bedwyr), Guenhuuara (Gwenhwyfar), Uther (Uthyr) and perhaps also Caliburnus (Caledfwlch), the latter becoming Excalibur in subsequent Arthurian tales. However, while names, key events, and titles may have been borrowed, Brynley Roberts has argued that \"the Arthurian section is Geoffrey's literary creation and it owes nothing to prior narrative.\" Geoffrey makes the Welsh Medraut into the villainous Modredus, but there is no trace of such a negative character for this figure in Welsh sources until the 16th century. There have been relatively few modern attempts to challenge the notion that the \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" is primarily Geoffrey's own work, with scholarly opinion often echoing William of Newburgh's late-12th-century comment that Geoffrey \"made up\" his narrative, perhaps through an \"inordinate love of lying\". Geoffrey Ashe is one dissenter from this view, believing that Geoffrey's narrative is partially derived from a lost source telling of the deeds of a 5th-century British king named Riotamus, this figure being the original Arthur, although historians and Celticists have been reluctant to follow Ashe in his conclusions.\nWhatever his sources may have been, the immense popularity of Geoffrey's \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" cannot be denied. Well over 200 manuscript copies of Geoffrey's Latin work are known to have survived, as well as translations into other languages. For example, 60 manuscripts are extant containing the \"Brut y Brenhinedd\", Welsh-language versions of the \"Historia\", the earliest of which were created in the 13th century. The old notion that some of these Welsh versions actually underlie Geoffrey's \"Historia\", advanced by antiquarians such as the 18th-century Lewis Morris, has long since been discounted in academic circles. As a result of this popularity, Geoffrey's \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" was enormously influential on the later medieval development of the Arthurian legend. While it was not the only creative force behind Arthurian romance, many of its elements were borrowed and developed (e.g., Merlin and the final fate of Arthur), and it provided the historical framework into which the romancers' tales of magical and wonderful adventures were inserted.\nRomance traditions.\nThe Welsh prose tale \"Culhwch and Olwen\" (latter half of the 12th century), included in the modern \"Mabinogion\" collection, has a much longer list of more than 200 of Arthur's men, though Cei and Bedwyr again take a central place. The story as a whole tells of Arthur helping his kinsman Culhwch win the hand of Olwen, daughter of Ysbaddaden Chief-Giant, by completing a series of apparently impossible tasks, including the hunt for the great semi-divine boar Twrch Trwyth. The 9th-century \"Historia Brittonum\" also refers to this tale, with the boar there named Troy(n)t. Finally, Arthur is mentioned numerous times in the Welsh Triads, a collection of short summaries of Welsh tradition and legend which are classified into groups of three linked characters or episodes to assist recall. The later manuscripts of the Triads are partly derivative from Geoffrey of Monmouth and later continental traditions, but the earliest ones show no such influence and are usually agreed to refer to pre-existing Welsh traditions. Even in these, however, Arthur's court has started to embody legendary Britain as a whole, with \"Arthur's Court\" sometimes substituted for \"The Island of Britain\" in the formula \"Three XXX of the Island of Britain\". While it is not clear from the \"Historia Brittonum\" and the \"Annales Cambriae\" that Arthur was even considered a king, by the time \"Culhwch and Olwen\" and the Triads were written he had become \"Penteyrnedd yr Ynys hon\", \"Chief of the Lords of this Island\", the overlord of Wales, Cornwall and the North.\nDuring the ongoing conquest of Wales by Edward I of England, he attempted to make King Arthur a fundamentally English character and hero. The completion of the conquest was one of the factors that shifted storytellers away from the Welsh roots of the original tales.\nThe popularity of Geoffrey's \"Historia\" and its other derivative works (such as Wace's \"Roman de Brut\") gave rise to a significant numbers of new Arthurian works in continental Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries, particularly in France. It was not, however, the only Arthurian influence on the developing \"Matter of Britain\". There is clear evidence that Arthur and Arthurian tales were familiar on the Continent before Geoffrey's work became widely known (see for example, the Modena Archivolt), and \"Celtic\" names and stories not found in Geoffrey's \"Historia\" appear in the Arthurian romances. From the perspective of Arthur, perhaps the most significant effect of this great outpouring of new Arthurian story was on the role of the king himself: much of this 12th-century and later Arthurian literature centres less on Arthur himself than on characters such as Lancelot and Guinevere, Percival, Galahad, Gawain, Ywain, and Tristan and Iseult. Whereas Arthur is very much at the centre of the pre-Galfridian material and Geoffrey's \"Historia\" itself, in the romances he is rapidly sidelined. His character also alters significantly. In both the earliest materials and Geoffrey he is a great and ferocious warrior, who laughs as he personally slaughters witches and giants and takes a leading role in all military campaigns, whereas in the continental romances he becomes the \"roi fain\u00e9ant\", the \"do-nothing king\", whose \"inactivity and acquiescence constituted a central flaw in his otherwise ideal society\". Arthur's role in these works is frequently that of a wise, dignified, even-tempered, somewhat bland, and occasionally feeble monarch. So, he simply turns pale and silent when he learns of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere in the \"Mort Artu\", whilst in \"Yvain, the Knight of the Lion\", he is unable to stay awake after a feast and has to retire for a nap. Nonetheless, as Norris J. Lacy has observed, whatever his faults and frailties may be in these Arthurian romances, \"his prestige is never\u2014or almost never\u2014compromised by his personal weaknesses\u00a0... his authority and glory remain intact.\"\nArthur and his retinue appear in some of the \"Lais\" of Marie de France, but it was the work of another French poet, Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, that had the greatest influence with regard to the development of Arthur's character and legend. Chr\u00e9tien wrote five Arthurian romances between c.\u20091170 and 1190. \"Erec and Enide\" and \"Clig\u00e8s\" are tales of courtly love with Arthur's court as their backdrop, demonstrating the shift away from the heroic world of the Welsh and Galfridian Arthur, while \"Yvain, the Knight of the Lion\", features Yvain and Gawain in a supernatural adventure, with Arthur very much on the sidelines and weakened. However, the most significant for the development of the Arthurian legend are \"Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart\", which introduces Lancelot and his adulterous relationship with Arthur's queen Guinevere, extending and popularising the recurring theme of Arthur as a cuckold, and \"Perceval, the Story of the Grail\", which introduces the Holy Grail and the Fisher King and which again sees Arthur having a much reduced role. Chr\u00e9tien was thus \"instrumental both in the elaboration of the Arthurian legend and in the establishment of the ideal form for the diffusion of that legend\", and much of what came after him in terms of the portrayal of Arthur and his world built upon the foundations he had laid. \"Perceval\", although unfinished, was particularly popular: four separate continuations of the poem appeared over the next half century, with the notion of the Grail and its quest being developed by other writers such as Robert de Boron, a fact that helped accelerate the decline of Arthur in continental romance. Similarly, Lancelot and his cuckolding of Arthur with Guinevere became one of the classic motifs of the Arthurian legend, although the Lancelot of the prose \"Lancelot\" (c.\u20091225) and later texts was a combination of Chr\u00e9tien's character and that of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's \"Lanzelet\". Chr\u00e9tien's work even appears to feed back into Welsh Arthurian literature, with the result that the romance Arthur began to replace the heroic, active Arthur in Welsh literary tradition. Particularly significant in this development were the three Welsh Arthurian romances, which are closely similar to those of Chr\u00e9tien, albeit with some significant differences: \"Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain\" is related to Chr\u00e9tien's \"Yvain\"; \"Geraint and Enid\", to \"Erec and Enide\"; and \"Peredur son of Efrawg\", to \"Perceval\".\nUp to c.\u20091210, continental Arthurian romance was expressed primarily through poetry; after this date the tales began to be told in prose. The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. These works were the \"Estoire del Saint Grail\", the \"Estoire de Merlin\", the \"Lancelot propre\" (or Prose \"Lancelot\", which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the \"Queste del Saint Graal\" and the \"Mort Artu\", which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister Morgause, and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chr\u00e9tien's \"Lancelot\", as Arthur's primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c.\u20091230\u201340), of which the \"Suite du Merlin\" is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the \"Estoire de Merlin\" and the \"Mort Artu\". During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's \"Voeux du Paon\" in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art.\nThe development of the medieval Arthurian cycle and the character of the \"Arthur of romance\" culminated in \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" (lit.\u2009'The Death of Arthur'), Thomas Malory's retelling of the entire legend in a single work in English in the late-15th century. Malory based his book\u2014originally titled \"The Whole Book of King Arthur and of His Noble Knights of the Round Table\"\u2014on the various previous romance versions, in particular the Vulgate Cycle, and appears to have aimed at creating a comprehensive and authoritative collection of Arthurian stories. Perhaps as a result of this, and the fact that \"Le Morte D'Arthur\" was one of the earliest printed books in England, published by William Caxton in 1485, most later Arthurian works are derivative of Malory's.\nDecline, revival, and the modern legend.\nPost-medieval literature.\nThe end of the Middle Ages brought with it a waning of interest in King Arthur. Although Malory's English version of the great French romances was popular, there were increasing attacks upon the truthfulness of the historical framework of the Arthurian romances \u2013 established since Geoffrey of Monmouth's time \u2013 and thus the legitimacy of the whole Matter of Britain. So, for example, the 16th-century humanist scholar Polydore Vergil famously rejected the claim that Arthur was the ruler of a post-Roman empire, found throughout the post-Galfridian medieval \"chronicle tradition\", to the horror of Welsh and English antiquarians. Social changes associated with the end of the medieval period and the Renaissance also conspired to rob the character of Arthur and his associated legend of some of their power to enthrall audiences, with the result that 1634 saw the last printing of Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" for nearly 200 years. King Arthur and the Arthurian legend were not entirely abandoned, but until the early 19th century the material was taken less seriously and was often used simply as a vehicle for allegories of 17th- and 18th-century politics. Thus Richard Blackmore's epics \"Prince Arthur\" (1695) and \"King Arthur\" (1697) feature Arthur as an allegory for the struggles of William III against James II. Similarly, the most popular Arthurian tale throughout this period seems to have been that of Tom Thumb, which was told first through chapbooks and later through the political plays of Henry Fielding; although the action is clearly set in Arthurian Britain, the treatment is humorous and Arthur appears as a primarily comedic version of his romance character. John Dryden's masque \"King Arthur\" is still performed, largely thanks to Henry Purcell's music, though seldom unabridged.\nTennyson and the revival.\nIn the early-19th century medievalism, Romanticism and the Gothic Revival reawakened interest in Arthur and the medieval romances. A new code of ethics for 19th-century gentlemen was shaped around the chivalric ideals embodied in the \"Arthur of romance\". This renewed interest first made itself felt in 1816, when Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" was reprinted for the first time since 1634. Initially, the medieval Arthurian legends were of particular interest to poets, inspiring, for example, William Wordsworth to write \"The Egyptian Maid\" (1835), an allegory of the Holy Grail. Pre-eminent among these was Alfred Tennyson, whose first Arthurian poem \"The Lady of Shalott\" was published in 1832. Arthur himself played a minor role in some of these works, following in the medieval romance tradition. Tennyson's Arthurian work reached its peak of popularity with \"Idylls of the King\", however, which reworked the entire narrative of Arthur's life for the Victorian era. It was first published in 1859 and sold 10,000 copies within the first week. In the \"Idylls\", Arthur became a symbol of ideal manhood who ultimately failed, through human weakness, to establish a perfect kingdom on earth. Tennyson's works prompted a large number of imitators, generated considerable public interest in the legends of Arthur and the character himself, and brought Malory's tales to a wider audience. Indeed, the first modernisation of Malory's great compilation of Arthur's tales was published in 1862, shortly after \"Idylls\" appeared, and there were six further editions and five competitors before the century ended.\nThis interest in the \"Arthur of romance\" and his associated stories continued through the 19th century and into the 20th, and influenced poets such as William Morris and Pre-Raphaelite artists including Edward Burne-Jones. Even the humorous tale of Tom Thumb, which had been the primary manifestation of Arthur's legend in the 18th century, was rewritten after the publication of \"Idylls\". While Tom maintained his small stature and remained a figure of comic relief, his story now included more elements from the medieval Arthurian romances and Arthur is treated more seriously and historically in these new versions. The revived Arthurian romance also proved influential in the United States, with such books as Sidney Lanier's \"The Boy's King Arthur\" (1880) reaching wide audiences and providing inspiration for Mark Twain's satire \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\" (1889). Although the 'Arthur of romance' was sometimes central to these new Arthurian works (as he was in Burne-Jones's \"The Sleep of Arthur in Avalon\", 1881\u20131898), on other occasions he reverted to his medieval status and is either marginalised or even missing entirely, with Richard Wagner's Arthurian opera \"Parsifal\" providing a notable instance of the latter. Furthermore, the revival of interest in Arthur and the Arthurian tales did not continue unabated. By the end of the 19th century, it was confined mainly to Pre-Raphaelite imitators, and it could not avoid being affected by the First World War, which damaged the reputation of chivalry and thus interest in its medieval manifestations and Arthur as chivalric role model. The romance tradition did, however, remain sufficiently powerful to persuade Thomas Hardy, Laurence Binyon and John Masefield to compose Arthurian plays, and T. S. Eliot alludes to the Arthur myth (but not Arthur) in his poem \"The Waste Land\", which mentions the Fisher King.\nModern legend.\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, the influence of the romance tradition of Arthur continued, through novels such as T. H. White's \"The Once and Future King\" (1958), Mary Stewart's \"The Crystal Cave\" (1970) and its four sequels, Thomas Berger's tragicomic \"Arthur Rex\" and Marion Zimmer Bradley's \"The Mists of Avalon\" (1982), in addition to comic strips such as \"Prince Valiant\" (from 1937 onward). Tennyson had reworked the romance tales of Arthur to suit and comment upon the issues of his day, and the same is often the case with modern treatments too. Mary Stewart's first three Arthurian novels present the wizard Merlin as the central character, rather than Arthur, and \"The Crystal Cave\" is narrated by Merlin in the first person, whereas Bradley's tale takes a feminist approach to Arthur and his legend, in contrast to the narratives of Arthur found in medieval materials. American authors often rework the story of Arthur to be more consistent with values such as equality and democracy. In John Cowper Powys's \"\" (1951), set in Wales in 499, just prior to the Saxon invasion, Arthur, the Emperor of Britain, is only a minor character, whereas Myrddin (Merlin) and Nineue, Tennyson's Vivien, are major figures. Myrddin's disappearance at the end of the novel is, \"in the tradition of magical hibernation when the king or mage leaves his people for some island or cave to return either at a more propitious or more dangerous time\", (see King Arthur's messianic return). Powys's earlier novel \"A Glastonbury Romance\" (1932) is concerned with both the Holy Grail and the legend that Arthur is buried at Glastonbury.\nThe romance Arthur has become popular in film and theatre as well. T. H. White's novel was adapted into the Lerner and Loewe stage musical \"Camelot\" (1960) and Walt Disney's animated film \"The Sword in the Stone\" (1963); \"Camelot\", with its focus on the love of Lancelot and Guinevere and the cuckolding of Arthur, was itself made into a film of the same name in 1967. The romance tradition of Arthur is particularly evident and in critically respected films like Robert Bresson's \"Lancelot du Lac\" (1974), \u00c9ric Rohmer's \"Perceval le Gallois\" (1978) and John Boorman's \"Excalibur\" (1981); it is also the main source of the material used in the Arthurian spoof \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" (1975).\nRetellings and reimaginings of the romance tradition are not the only important aspect of the modern legend of King Arthur. Attempts to portray Arthur as a genuine historical figure of c.\u2009500, stripping away the \"romance\", have also emerged. As Taylor and Brewer have noted, this return to the medieval \"chronicle tradition\" of Geoffrey of Monmouth and the \"Historia Brittonum\" is a recent trend which became dominant in Arthurian literature in the years following the outbreak of the Second World War, when Arthur's legendary resistance to Germanic enemies struck a chord in Britain. Clemence Dane's series of radio plays, \"The Saviours\" (1942), used a historical Arthur to embody the spirit of heroic resistance against desperate odds, and Robert Sherriff's play \"The Long Sunset\" (1955) saw Arthur rallying Romano-British resistance against the Germanic invaders. This trend towards placing Arthur in a historical setting is also apparent in historical and fantasy novels published during this period. \nArthur has also been used as a model for modern-day behaviour. In the 1930s, the Order of the Fellowship of the Knights of the Round Table was formed in Britain to promote Christian ideals and Arthurian notions of medieval chivalry. In the United States, hundreds of thousands of boys and girls joined Arthurian youth groups, such as the Knights of King Arthur, in which Arthur and his legends were promoted as wholesome exemplars. However, Arthur's diffusion within modern culture goes beyond such Arthurian endeavours, with Arthurian names being regularly attached to objects, buildings, and places. As Norris J. Lacy has observed, \"The popular notion of Arthur appears to be limited, not surprisingly, to a few motifs and names, but there can be no doubt of the extent to which a legend born many centuries ago is profoundly embedded in modern culture at every level.\" \nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His greatest achievement was the world's first programmable computer; the functional program-controlled Turing-complete Z3 became operational in May 1941. Thanks to this machine and its predecessors, Zuse is regarded by some as the inventor and father of the modern computer.\nZuse was noted for the S2 computing machine, considered the first process control computer. In 1941, he founded one of the earliest computer businesses, producing the Z4, which became the world's first commercial computer. From 1943 to 1945 he designed Plankalk\u00fcl, the first high-level programming language. In 1969, Zuse suggested the concept of a computation-based universe in his book (\"Calculating Space\").\nMuch of his early work was financed by his family and commerce, but after 1939 he was given resources by the government of Nazi Germany. Due to World War II, Zuse's work went largely unnoticed in the United Kingdom and United States. Possibly his first documented influence on a US company was IBM's option on his patents in 1946. The Z4 also served as the inspiration for the construction of the ERMETH, the first Swiss computer and one of the first in Europe.\nEarly life and education.\nKonrad Zuse was born in Berlin on 22 June 1910. In 1912, his family moved to East Prussian Braunsberg (now Braniewo in Poland), where his father was a postal clerk. Zuse attended the Collegium Hosianum in Braunsberg, and in 1923, the family moved to Hoyerswerda, where he passed his Abitur in 1928, qualifying him to enter university.\nHe enrolled at Technische Hochschule Berlin (now Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin) and explored both engineering and architecture, but found them boring. Zuse then pursued civil engineering, graduating in 1935.\nCareer.\nAfter graduation, Zuse worked for the Ford Motor Company, using his artistic skills in the design of advertisements. He started work as a design engineer at the Henschel aircraft factory in Sch\u00f6nefeld near Berlin. This required the performance of many routine calculations by hand, leading him to theorize and plan a way of doing them by machine.\nBeginning in 1935, he experimented in the construction of computers in his parents' flat on 38, moving with them into their new flat on 10, the street leading up the Kreuzberg, Berlin.418 Working in his parents' apartment in 1936, he produced his first attempt, the Z1, a floating-point binary mechanical calculator with limited programmability, reading instructions from a perforated 35\u00a0mm film. \nIn 1937, Zuse submitted two patents that anticipated a von Neumann architecture. In 1938, he finished the Z1 which contained some 30,000 metal parts and never worked well due to insufficient mechanical precision. On 30 January 1944, the Z1 and its original blueprints were destroyed with his parents' flat and many neighbouring buildings by a British air raid in World War II.426\nZuse completed his work entirely independently of other leading computer scientists and mathematicians of his day. Between 1936 and 1945, he was in near-total intellectual isolation.\n1939\u20131945.\nIn 1939, Zuse was called to military service, where he was given the resources to ultimately build the Z2. In September 1940 Zuse presented the Z2, covering several rooms in the parental flat, to experts of the (DVL; German Research Institute for Aviation).424 The Z2 was a revised version of the Z1 using telephone relays.\nIn 1940, the German government began funding him and his company through the (AVA, Aerodynamic Research Institute, forerunner of the DLR), which used his work for the production of glide bombs. Zuse built the S1 and S2 computing machines, which were special purpose devices which computed aerodynamic corrections to the wings of radio-controlled flying bombs. The S2 featured an integrated analog-to-digital converter under program control, making it the first process-controlled computer.75\nIn 1941 Zuse started a company, (Zuse Apparatus Construction), to manufacture his machines, renting a workshop on the opposite side in 7 and stretching through the block to 29 (renamed and renumbered as Mehringdamm 84 in 1947).\nIn 1941, he improved on the basic Z2 machine, and built the Z3. On 12 May 1941 Zuse presented the Z3, built in his workshop, to the public.425 The Z3 was a binary 22-bit floating-point calculator featuring programmability with loops but without conditional jumps, with memory and a calculation unit based on telephone relays. The telephone relays used in his machines were largely collected from discarded stock. Despite the absence of conditional jumps, the Z3 was a Turing complete computer. However, Turing-completeness was never considered by Zuse (who was unaware of Turing's work and had practical applications in mind) and only demonstrated in 1998 (see History of computing hardware).\nThe Z3, the first fully operational electromechanical computer, was partially financed by German government-supported DVL, which wanted their extensive calculations automated. A request by his co-worker Helmut Schreyer\u2014who had helped Zuse build the Z3 prototype in 1938\u2014for government funding for an electronic successor to the Z3 was denied as \"strategically unimportant\".\nIn 1937, Schreyer had advised Zuse to use vacuum tubes as switching elements; Zuse at this time considered it a \"crazy idea\" ( in his own words). Zuse's workshop on 7 (along with the Z3) was destroyed in an Allied Air raid in late 1943 and the parental flat with Z1 and Z2 on 30 January the following year, whereas the successor Z4, which Zuse had begun constructing in 194275 in new premises in the on 6, remained intact.428\nOn 3 February 1945, aerial bombing caused devastating destruction in the Luisenstadt, the area around , including neighbouring houses. This event effectively brought Zuse's research and development to a complete halt. The partially finished, telephone relay-based Z4 computer was then packed and moved from Berlin on 14 February, arriving in G\u00f6ttingen approximately two weeks later.428\nThese machines contributed to the Henschel Werke Hs 293 and Hs 294 guided missiles developed by the German military between 1941 and 1945, which were the precursors to the modern cruise missile.75 The circuit design of the S1 was the predecessor of Zuse's Z11.75 Zuse believed that these machines had been captured by occupying Soviet troops in 1945.75\nWhile working on his Z4 computer, Zuse realised that programming in machine code was too complicated. He started working on a PhD thesis detailing the first high-level programming language, (\"Plan Calculus\") and, as an elaborate example program, the first real computer chess engine.\n1945\u20131995.\nAfter the 1945 Luisenstadt bombing, he fled from Berlin to the rural Allg\u00e4u. In the extreme deprivation of post-war Germany Zuse was unable to build computers.\nZuse founded one of the earliest computer companies: the . Capital was raised in 1946 through ETH Zurich and an IBM option on Zuse's patents.\nIn 1947, according to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics, there was a meeting between Alan Turing and Konrad Zuse in G\u00f6ttingen. The encounter had the form of a colloquium. Participants were John Womersley, Turing, Arthur Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Helmut Schreyer, Alwin Walther, and Billing. (For more details see Herbert Bruderer, ).\nIt was not until 1949 that Zuse was able to resume work on the Z4. He would show the computer to the mathematician Eduard Stiefel of the ETH Zurich. The two men settled a deal to lend the Z4 to the ETH.\nIn November 1949, Zuse founded another company, Zuse KG, in Haunetal-Neukirchen; in 1957, the company's head office moved to Bad Hersfeld. The Z4 was finished and delivered to the ETH Zurich in July 1950, where it proved very reliable. At that time, it was the only working digital computer in Central Europe, and the second computer in the world to be sold or loaned, beaten only by the BINAC, which never worked properly after it was delivered. Other computers, all numbered with a leading Z, up to Z43, were built by Zuse and his company. Notable are the Z11, which was sold to the optics industry and to universities, and the Z22, the first computer with a memory based on magnetic storage.\nUnable to do any hardware development, he continued working on , eventually publishing some brief excerpts of his thesis in 1948 and 1959; the work in its entirety, however, remained unpublished until 1972. The PhD thesis was submitted at University of Augsburg, but it was rejected because Zuse forgot to pay the DM\u00a0400 university enrollment fee. The rejection did not bother him. \n slightly influenced the design of ALGOL 58 but was itself implemented only in 1975 in a dissertation by Joachim Hohmann. Heinz Rutishauser, one of the inventors of ALGOL, wrote: \"The very first attempt to devise an algorithmic language was undertaken in 1948 by K. Zuse. His notation was quite general, but the proposal never attained the consideration it deserved.\" Further implementations followed in 1998 and then in 2000 by a team from the Free University of Berlin. Donald Knuth suggested a thought experiment: What might have happened had the bombing not taken place, and had the PhD thesis accordingly been published as planned?\nIn 1956, Zuse began to work on a high precision, large format plotter. It was demonstrated at the 1961 Hanover Fair, and became well known also outside of the technical world thanks to Frieder Nake's pioneering computer art work. Other plotters designed by Zuse include the ZUSE Z90 and ZUSE Z9004.\nIn 1967, Zuse suggested that the universe itself is running on a cellular automaton or similar computational structure (digital physics); in 1969, he published the book (translated into English as \"Calculating Space\").\nBetween 1989 and 1995, Zuse conceptualized and created a purely mechanical, extensible, modular tower automaton he named \"helix tower\" (). The structure is based on a gear drive that employs rotary motion (e.g. provided by a crank) to assemble modular components from a storage space, elevating a tube-shaped tower; the process is reversible, and inverting the input direction will deconstruct the tower and store the components. In 2009, the restored Zuse's original 1:30 functional model that can be extended to a height of 2.7\u00a0m. Zuse intended the full construction to reach a height of 120\u00a0m, and envisioned it for use with wind power generators and radio transmission installations.\nBetween 1987 and 1989, Zuse recreated the Z1, suffering a heart attack midway through the project. It cost 800,000\u00a0DM (approximately $500,000) and required four individuals (including Zuse) to assemble it. Funding for this retrocomputing project was provided by Siemens and a consortium of five companies.\nPersonal life.\nKonrad Zuse married Gisela Brandes in January 1945, employing a carriage, himself dressed in tailcoat and top hat and with Gisela in a wedding veil, for Zuse attached importance to a \"noble ceremony\". Their son Horst, the first of five children, was born in November 1945.\nWhile Zuse never became a member of the Nazi Party, he is not known to have expressed any doubts or qualms about working for the Nazi war effort. Much later, he suggested that in modern times, the best scientists and engineers usually have to choose between either doing their work for more or less questionable business and military interests in a Faustian bargain, or not pursuing their line of work at all.\nAfter Zuse retired, he focused on his hobby of painting. He signed his paintings as \"Kuno [von und zu] See\".\nZuse was an atheist.\nZuse died on 18 December 1995 in H\u00fcnfeld, Hesse (near Fulda) from heart failure.\nAwards and honours.\nZuse received several awards for his work:\nThe Zuse Institute Berlin is named in his honour.\nThe Konrad Zuse Medal of the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Informatik, and the Konrad Zuse Medal of the Zentralverband des Deutschen Baugewerbes (Central Association of German Construction), are both named after Zuse.\nA replica of the Z3, as well as the original Z4, is in the Deutsches Museum in Munich. The in Berlin has an exhibition devoted to Zuse, displaying twelve of his machines, including a replica of the Z1 and several of Zuse's paintings.\nThe 100th anniversary of his birth was celebrated by exhibitions, lectures and workshops.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
