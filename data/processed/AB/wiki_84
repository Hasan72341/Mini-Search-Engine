It was released on August 12, 1991, by Elektra Records. Recording sessions took place at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles over an eight-month span that frequently found Metallica at odds with their new producer Bob Rock. The album marked a change in the band's music from the thrash metal style of their previous four albums to a slower, heavier, and more refined sound.\nMetallica promoted \"Metallica\" with a series of tours. They also released five singles to promote the album: \"Enter Sandman\", \"The Unforgiven\", \"Nothing Else Matters\", \"Wherever I May Roam\", and \"Sad but True\", all of which have been considered to be among the band's best-known songs. The song \"Don't Tread on Me\" was also issued to rock radio shortly after the album's release but did not receive a commercial single release.\n\"Metallica\" received widespread critical acclaim and became the band's best-selling album. It debuted at number one in ten countries and spent four consecutive weeks at the top of the \"Billboard\" 200, making it Metallica's first album to top the album charts. With over 30 million copies sold worldwide, \"Metallica\" is one of the best-selling albums worldwide, and also one of the best-selling albums in the United States since Nielsen SoundScan tracking began. The album was certified 2\u00d7 Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2025, and has sold over twenty million copies in the United States, being the first album in the SoundScan era to do so.\nThe band played \"Metallica\" in reverse order during the 2012 European Black Album Tour. In 2020, the album was ranked number 235 on \"Rolling Stone\"'s \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" list. In December 2019, \"Metallica\" became the fourth release in American history to enter the 550-week milestone on the \"Billboard\" 200. It also became the second-longest charting traditional title in history only behind \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" (1973) by Pink Floyd.\nBackground and recording.\nAt the time of \"Metallica\"'s recording, the band's songs were written mainly by frontman James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, with Hetfield being the lyricist. The duo frequently composed together at Ulrich's house in Berkeley, California. Several song ideas and concepts were conceived by other members of the band, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Jason Newsted. For instance, Newsted wrote the main riff of \"My Friend of Misery\", which was originally intended to be an instrumental, one of which had been included on every previous Metallica album. The songs were written in two months in mid-1990; the ideas for some of them were originated during the Damaged Justice Tour. Metallica was impressed with Bob Rock's production work on M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's \"Dr. Feelgood\" (1989) and decided to hire him to work on their album. Initially, the band members were not interested in having Rock producing the album as well, but changed their minds. Ulrich said, \"We felt that we still had our best record in us and Bob Rock could help us make it\".\nFour demos for the album were recorded on August 13, 1990; \"Enter Sandman\", \"The Unforgiven\", \"Nothing Else Matters\" and \"Wherever I May Roam\". The lead single \"Enter Sandman\" was the first song to be written and the last to receive lyrics. On October 4, 1990, a demo of \"Sad but True\" was recorded. In October 1990, Metallica began recording at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, to record the album, and also at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia, for about a week. Additional overdubs and mixing took place at A&amp;M Studios in Hollywood towards the end of the album. Hetfield stated about the recording: \"What we really wanted was a live feel. In the past, Lars and I constructed the rhythm parts without Kirk and Jason. This time I wanted to try playing as a band unit in the studio. It lightens things up and you get more of a vibe.\"\nBecause it was Rock's first time producing a Metallica album, he had the band make the album in different ways; he asked them to record songs collaboratively rather than individually in separate locations. He also suggested recording tracks live and using harmonic vocals for Hetfield. Rock was expecting the production to be \"easy\" but had trouble working with the band, leading to frequent, engaged arguments with the band members over aspects of the album. Rock wanted Hetfield to write better lyrics and found his experience recording with Metallica disappointing: the recording experience was so stressful that Rock briefly swore never to work with the band again. The tension between band and producer was documented in \"A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica\" and \"Classic Albums: Metallica \u2013 Metallica\".\nSince the band was perfectionist, Rock insisted they record as many takes as needed to get the sound they wanted.&lt;ref name=\"AY&amp;\u00bdITLOM (1/2)\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The album was remixed three times and cost US$. The troubled production coincided with Ulrich, Hammett, and Newsted divorcing their wives; Hammett said this influenced their playing because they were \"trying to take those feeling of guilt and failure and channel them into the music, to get something positive out of it\".\nComposition and lyrics.\nThe album was a change in Metallica's direction from the thrash metal style of the band's previous four studio albums towards a more commercial, heavy metal sound, but still had characteristics of thrash metal. The band took a simpler approach partly because the members felt the songs on \"...And Justice for All\" were too long and complex. Hetfield said that radio airplay was not their intention, but because they felt \"we had pretty much done the longer song format to death,\" and considered a good change doing songs with just two riffs and \"only taking two minutes to get the point across\". Ulrich added that the band was feeling a musical insecurity \u2014 \"We felt inadequate as musicians and as songwriters. That made us go too far, around \"Master of Puppets\" and \"Justice\", in the direction of trying to prove ourselves. 'We'll do all this weird-ass shit sideways to prove that we are capable musicians and songwriters'\" \u2013 and Hetfield added he wanted to avoid getting stale: \"Sitting there and worrying about whether people are going to like the album, therefore we have to write a certain kind of song \u2014 you just end up writing for someone else. Everyone's different. If everyone was the same, it would be boring as shit.\"\nInstruments not usually used by heavy metal bands, such as the cellos in \"The Unforgiven\" and the orchestra in \"Nothing Else Matters\", were added at Rock's insistence. Rock also raised the volume of the bass guitar, which had been nearly inaudible on the previous album \"...And Justice for All\". Newsted said he tried to \"create a real rhythm section rather than a one-dimensional sound\" with his bass. Newsted credited Rock with helping him find a sound that would work without killing the bass drum or messing with the lower end of the guitar, which Newsted claimed had always been a real big problem with him. Ulrich said he tried to avoid the \"progressive Peartian paradiddles which became boring to play live\" in his drumming and used a basic sound similar to those of the Rolling Stones' Charlie Watts and AC/DC's Phil Rudd.\nThe lyrics of \"Metallica\" written by James Hetfield were more personal and introspective in nature than those of previous Metallica albums; Rock said Hetfield's songwriting became more confident, and that he was inspired by Bob Dylan, Bob Marley, and John Lennon. According to Chris True of AllMusic, \"Enter Sandman\" is about \"nightmares and all that come with them\". \"The God That Failed\" dealt with the death of Hetfield's mother from cancer and her Christian Science beliefs, which kept her from seeking medical treatment. \"Nothing Else Matters\" was a love song Hetfield wrote about his recent ex-girlfriend while on tour. Hetfield said the album's lyrical themes were more introspective because he wanted \"lyrics that the band could stand behind \u2013 but we are four completely different individuals. So the only way to go was in.\"\nPackaging.\nMetallica had many discussions about the album title. The original working title was called \"Married to Metal\" as a result of Hammett, Ulrich and Newsted's divorces, but was downplayed as a \"running joke\", according to Ulrich. Other names considered were \"Five\" and the title of one of the songs, but eventually chose an eponym because they \"wanted to keep it simple.\" The album's cover depicts the band's logo angled against the upper left corner and a coiled snake derived from the Gadsden flag in the bottom right corner. For the initial release, both emblems were embossed so they could barely be seen against the black background, giving \"Metallica\" the nickname \"The Black Album\". These emblems also appear on the back cover of the album. For later and current releases, both emblems are dark gray so they stand out more prominently. The motto of the Gadsden flag, \"Don't Tread on Me\", is also the title of a song on the album. A folded, pageless booklet depicts the faces of the band's members against a black background. The lyrics and liner notes are also printed on a grey background.\nThe cover is reminiscent of Spinal Tap's album \"Smell the Glove\", which the band jokingly acknowledged in its documentary \"A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica\". Members of Spinal Tap appeared on the film and asked Metallica about it, with Lars Ulrich commenting that British rock group Status Quo was the original inspiration as that band's \"Hello!\" album cover was also black.\nMarketing and sales.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nYou think one day some fucker's gonna tell you, 'You have a number one record in America,' and the whole world will ejaculate. I stood there in my hotel room, and there was this fax that said, 'You're number one.' And it was, like, 'Well, okay.' It was just another fucking fax from the office.\n\u2014Lars Ulrich, on Metallica's first number one album\n\"Enter Sandman\" was released as \"Metallica\"'s lead single on July 29, 1991; it reached number 16 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The follow-up single, \"Don't Tread on Me\", was released promotionally but did not chart. The subsequent single, \"The Unforgiven\", was a Top 40 hit; it peaked in the Top 10 in Australia.\n\"Metallica\" was released on August 12, 1991, and was the band's first album to debut at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling 598,000 copies in its first week. It was certified platinum in two weeks and spent four consecutive weeks atop the \"Billboard\" 200. Meanwhile, more singles were released to further success. \"Nothing Else Matters\" reached number six in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and \"Wherever I May Roam\" peaked at number two on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks singles chart, although the 1993 single \"Sad but True\" charted only for one week on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at 98. Almost all singles were accompanied by music videos; the Wayne Isham-directed \"Enter Sandman\" promotional film won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards.\nInternationally, \"Metallica\" was also a success. It debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and was certified 2\u00d7 platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for selling 600,000 copies in the UK. \"Metallica\" topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. It also reached the top five in Austria, Finland, and Japan, as well as the top 10 in Spain. The album failed to reach the top 20 in Ireland, having peaked at number 27. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) certified the album 12\u00d7 platinum. It received diamond plaques from the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) and the Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ) for shipping a million and 150,000 copies, respectively.\nLogging over 488 weeks on the US \"Billboard\" 200, \"Metallica\" proved the third-longest charting album in the Nielsen SoundScan era, behind Pink Floyd's \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" and Carole King's \"Tapestry\". In 2009, it surpassed Shania Twain's \"Come On Over\" as the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. It became the first album in the SoundScan era to pass 16\u00a0million in sales, and with 16.4\u00a0million copies sold by 2016, \"Metallica\" is the best-selling album in the United States since Nielsen SoundScan tracking began in 1991. Of that sum, 5.8\u00a0million were purchased on cassette. The album never sold fewer than 1,000 copies in a week, and moved a weekly average of 5,000 copies in 2016. \"Metallica\" was certified 2\u00d7 Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2025 for shipping twenty million copies in the US. \"Metallica\" sold 31\u00a0million copies worldwide on physical media. All five of \"Metallica\"'s singles, \"Enter Sandman\", \"The Unforgiven\", \"Nothing Else Matters\", \"Wherever I May Roam\" and \"Sad but True\" charted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\nTouring.\nIn 1991, for the fourth time, Metallica played as part of the Monsters of Rock festival tour. The last concert of the tour was held on September 28, 1991, at Tushino Airfield in Moscow; it was described as \"the first free outdoor Western rock concert in Soviet history\" and was attended by an estimated 150,000 to 500,000 people. Some unofficial estimates put the attendance as high as 1,600,000. The first tour directly intended to support the album, the Wherever We May Roam Tour, included a performance at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, at which Metallica performed a short set list, consisting of \"Enter Sandman\", \"Sad but True\", and \"Nothing Else Matters\", along with Hetfield performed the Queen song \"Stone Cold Crazy\" with John Deacon, Brian May, and Roger Taylor of Queen and Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath. At one of the tour's first gigs the floor of the \"Snake Pit\", an audience area completely surrounded by the stage's triangular catwalk, collapsed. The January 13 and 14, 1992, shows in San Diego were later released in the box set \"\", while the tour and the album were documented in the documentary \"A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica\".\nMetallica's Wherever We May Roam Tour also overlapped with Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion Tour. Hetfield suffered second and third degree burns to his arms, face, hands, and legs on August 8, 1992, during a Montreal show in the co-headlining Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour. The tour included pyrotechnics, which were installed on-stage. Hetfield accidentally walked into a flame shot from a pyrotechnic device during a live performance of the introduction of \"Fade to Black\".&lt;ref name=\"AY&amp;\u00bdITLOM (2/2)\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Metallica left the stage and later updated the crowd on James' status. Guns N' Roses then delayed taking the stage for another two hours, resulting in fans becoming restless. The Guns' frontman, Axl Rose, stormed off the stage partway through their set, sending much of the frustrated crowd into a riot. Newsted said Hetfield's skin was \"bubbling like on \"The Toxic Avenger\"\". The tour recommenced on August 25 in Phoenix, and although Hetfield could sing, he could not play guitar for the remainder of the tour. Guitar technician John Marshall, who had previously filled in on rhythm guitar and was then playing in Metal Church, played guitar for the recovering Hetfield. Brazilian musician Andreas Kisser from Sepultura was initially considered to join the tour, but Marshall was ultimately chosen.\nThe shows in Mexico City across February and March 1993 during the Nowhere Else to Roam tour were recorded, filmed and later also released as part of the band's first box set, which was released in November 1993 and titled \"Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge\". The collection contained three live CDs, three home videos, and a book filled with riders and letters. Pressings of the box set since November 2002 includes two DVDs, the first one being filmed at San Diego on the Wherever We May Roam Tour, and the latter at Seattle on the Damaged Justice Tour. \"Binge &amp; Purge\" was packaged as a cardboard box resembling that of a typical tour equipment transport box. The box set also featured a recreated copy of an access pass to the \"Snakepit\" part of the tour stage, as well as a cardboard drawing/airbrush stencil for the \"Scary Guy\" logo. The Mexico City shows were also the first time the band met future member Robert Trujillo, who was in Suicidal Tendencies at the time.\nThe final tour supporting the album, the Shit Hits the Sheds Tour, included a performance at Woodstock '94 that followed Nine Inch Nails and preceded Aerosmith on August 13 in front of a crowd of 350,000. Some songs, such as \"Enter Sandman\", \"Nothing Else Matters\", and \"Sad but True\", became permanent staples of Metallica's concert setlists during these and subsequent tours. Other songs though, such as \"Holier than Thou\", \"The God That Failed\", \"Through the Never\", and \"The Unforgiven\" were no longer included in performances after 1995 and would not be played again until the 2000s, when Metallica began performing a more extensive back catalog of songs with Robert Trujillo on bass after he joined the band upon completion of the album \"St. Anger\".\nAfter touring duties for the album were finished, Metallica filed a lawsuit against Elektra Records, which tried to force the record label to terminate the band's contract and give the band ownership of their master recordings. The band based its claim on a section of the California Labor Code that allows employees to be released from a personal services contract after seven years. Metallica had sold 40\u00a0million copies worldwide upon the filing of the suit. Metallica had been signed to the label for over a decade but was still operating under the terms of its original 1984 contract, which provided a relatively low 14% royalty rate. The band members said they were taking the action because they were ambivalent about Robert Morgado's refusal to give them another record deal along with Bob Krasnow, who retired from his job at the label shortly afterwards. Elektra responded by counter-suing the band, but in December 1994, Warner Music Group United States chairman Doug Morris offered Metallica a lucrative new deal in exchange for dropping the suit, which was reported to be even more generous than the earlier Krasnow deal. In January 1995, both parties settled out of court with a non-disclosure agreement. Metallica played the album in its entirety during the 2012 European Black Album Tour.\nCritical reception.\n\"Metallica\" was met with widespread acclaim from both heavy metal journalists and mainstream publications, including \"NME\", \"The New York Times\", and \"The Village Voice\". In \"Entertainment Weekly\", David Browne called it \"rock's preeminent speed-metal cyclone\", and said, \"Metallica may have invented a new genre: progressive thrash\". \"Q\" magazine's Mark Cooper said he found the album's avoidance of metal's typically clumsy metaphors and glossy production refreshing; he said, \"Metallica manage to rekindle the kind of intensity that fired the likes of Black Sabbath before metal fell in love with its own cliches\". \"Select\" magazine's David Cavanagh believed the album lacks artifice and is \"disarmingly genuine\". In his review for \"Spin\", Alec Foege found the music's harmonies vividly performed and said that Metallica showcase their \"newfound versatility\" on songs such as \"The Unforgiven\" and \"Holier than Thou\". Robert Palmer, writing in \"Rolling Stone\", said that several songs sound like \"hard-rock classics\" and that, apart from \"Don't Tread on Me\", \"Metallica\" is an \"exemplary album of mature but still kickass rock &amp; roll\". In his guide to Metallica's albums up to that point, Greg Kot of the \"Chicago Tribune\" recommended the album as \"a great place for Metallica neophytes to start, with its more concise songs and explosive production.\"\nSome reviewers had reservations. Jonathan Gold, in the \"Los Angeles Times\", said that while Metallica had embraced pop sensibilities \"quite well\", there was a sense the group was \"no longer in love with the possibilities of its sound\" on an album whose difficulty being embraced by the \"metal cult\" mirrored Bob Dylan going electric in the mid-1960s. More critical was Robert Christgau, who wrote in his \"Consumer Guide\" for \"The Village Voice\" that he \"put James Hetfield out of his misery in under five plays\" of the album and that he \"found life getting shorter with every song\". In his 2000 collection \"Christgau's Consumer Guide\", Christgau later graded \"Metallica\" a \"dud\", indicating \"a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought\".\nLegacy.\nRetrospective appraisals have been positive. In a retrospective article, \"Kerrang!\" said \"Metallica\" is the album that \"propelled [the band] out of the metal ghetto to true mainstream global rock superstardom\". \"Melody Maker\" said that as a deliberate departure from the band's thrash style on \"...And Justice for All\", \"\"Metallica\" was slower, less complicated, and probably twice as heavy as anything they'd done before\". In his review for BBC Music, Sid Smith said that although staunch listeners of the band accused them of selling out, Metallica confidently departed from the style of their previous albums and transitioned \"from cult metal gods to bona fide rock stars\". \"Classic Rock\" called it \"the absolute pinnacle of Metallica's long and successful career\", and credited the album for inspiring 1990s post-grunge music and convincing the music industry to embrace heavy metal as a genre with mass appeal. \nAuthor and philosopher Thomas Walker wrote in 2020, \"Its success at encapsulating...[individualist] ideas in musical form and bringing them to a global audience is truly unique.\" AllMusic's Steve Huey believed the massive popularity of \"Metallica\" inspired other speed metal bands to also embrace a simpler, less progressive sound. He deemed it \"a good, but not quite great, album, one whose best moments deservedly captured the heavy metal crown, but whose approach also foreshadowed a creative decline [for Metallica.]\" Speaking in \"The Independent\", Metallica biographer Paul Stenning explained that Metallica created \"a sound that had not really been heard in metal before, especially by a thrash band.\"\nIron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson said that Metallica should be given huge credit for \"grabbing the opportunity when it came up, taking the risk and deservedly reaping the enormous rewards\", and that their achievement with the album cannot be underestimated. He also shared his thoughts on it as well, \"It's one of those seminal albums that just gets it right. It's extremely well-produced, and every note on that album is totally under control. I admire how they did it, and what they did with the songs, and it was very effective: it undoubtedly did help push metal into the mainstream.\"\nTo celebrate the 30th anniversary of \"Metallica\", a 53-track covers album titled \"The Metallica Blacklist\" was released on September 10, 2021. The album features covers of songs from \"Metallica\" from over 50 artists in various styles. All profits from the album are donated to the band's All Within My Hands Foundation as well as charities of each contributing artist's choice.\nAccolades.\n\"Metallica\" was voted the eighth best album of 1991 in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by \"The Village Voice\". \"Melody Maker\" ranked it number 16 in the magazine's December 1991 list of the year's best albums. In 1992, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. \nIn 2000, it was voted number 88 in Colin Larkin's \"All Time Top 1000 Albums\". In 2012, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Metallica\" number 255 on \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", and then number 235 in a 2020 revised edition of the list. It was also ranked 25th on the magazine's \"100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time\" (2017). \"Spin\" ranked it number 52 on the \"90 Greatest Albums of the '90s\" (1999), with its entry reading: \"this record's diamond-tipped tuneage stripped the band's melancholy guitar excess down to melodic, radio-ready bullets and ballads\".\n\"Metallica\" featured in \"Q\" magazine's August 2000 list of the \"Best Metal Albums of All Time\"; the magazine said the album \"transformed them from cult metal heroes into global superstars, bringing a little refinement to their undoubted power\". In 1999, eight years after the album's release, \"Metallica\" won a Billboard Music Award for Catalog Album of the Year.\nTrack listing.\nNote\nReissues.\n\"Metallica\" has been reissued several times, including in 2008, in 2010, and in 2014. To mark its 30th anniversary, a remastered edition was released on September 10, 2021. The album was remastered by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering, with all content overseen by executive producer Greg Fidelman. A limited edition box set was released, which includes the remastered album on a 180-gram double LP and a CD, as well as three live LPs, 14 CDs and six DVDs featuring unreleased content, and various other physical merchandise.\nPersonnel.\nCredits are taken from the album's liner notes, except where noted.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCharts.\nYear-end charts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18761", "revid": "51046825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18761", "title": "Load (album)", "text": "Load is the sixth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on June 4, 1996, through Elektra Records in the United States and Vertigo Records internationally. It was recorded between May 1995 and April 1996 primarily in Sausalito, California, with additional sessions in New York City. Bob Rock returned as producer from \"Metallica\" (1991). Compared to previous albums, the recording sessions were more relaxed and productive, resulting in almost 30 songs being recorded. While a double album was considered, the band decided to split the material into two albums; half appeared on \"Load\" and the other half was released as \"Reload\" the following year.\nFor \"Load\", Metallica strayed away from their thrash metal roots in favor of a hard rock sound. The band members became influenced by non-metal artists during the writing process, resulting in an array of musical styles such as Southern rock, blues rock, country rock, alternative rock, and grunge. The band also changed up their playing styles, with guitarist Kirk Hammett playing rhythm guitar parts for the first time. Compared to previous albums, the lyrics on \"Load\" are more personal and reflective, resulting from lead singer James Hetfield's internal struggles and personal life. The cover artwork is an abstract painting by artist Andres Serrano created by mixing blood and his own semen.\nMetallica adopted a new image during the period, which included short hair, leather jackets, and make-up. The new look and change in sound was criticized by many fans before \"Load\"'s release. Nevertheless, \"Load\" was a commercial success, topping the charts in over 15 countries and spending four consecutive weeks at number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart. Four singles were released: \"Until It Sleeps\", \"Hero of the Day\", \"Mama Said\", and \"King Nothing\"; the first became Metallica's first and only US top ten hit. The band supported the album on the Poor Touring Me tour (1996\u20131997).\n\"Load\" received mixed reviews from music critics. While some critics praised the band's performances and welcomed the new sound, others felt that the experimentation made them less forward-thinking and conventional, failing to push the band creatively forward. Retrospective reviewers generally describe \"Load\" as overlong and believe it and \"Reload\" could have been condensed into a single album. A super deluxe reissue was released in June 2025.\nBackground.\nMetallica released their fifth studio album \"Metallica\" in August 1991. A major commercial success, it debuted at number one in the United States and the United Kingdom, among others, becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time with estimated sales of 30 million copies worldwide. With the album, Metallica became one of the biggest rock bands in the world. From 1991 to 1993, the band toured \"Metallica\", performing 266 concerts across three concert tours. Another tour followed in mid-1994 to promote the live album \"\" (1993).\nThroughout early 1994, the band members spent time away from each other: lead vocalist and guitarist James Hetfield devoted time to hunting; guitarist Kirk Hammett studied film, jazz, and Asian arts at San Francisco State University; bassist Jason Newsted created his own recording studio, The Chophouse; and drummer Lars Ulrich took the band's label, Elektra Records, to court in hopes of breaking their contract following a disagreement with the label's new management. The two parties eventually reached an agreement, with Metallica staying with Elektra under a new contract.\nRecording.\nBeginning in May 1994, Hetfield and Ulrich worked as a duo in the latter's basement recording studio, The Dungeon, observing the band members' demos recorded on the road over the past two years. Full-band rehearsals began in October and finished in January 1995. At this point, the band members' influences ranged outside of heavy metal: Hetfield immersed himself in songwriters such as Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits, and Nick Cave, and American folk and country music; Hammett grew interest in David Bowie's works with Robert Fripp and Adrian Belew, and the blues music of Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy, and Howlin' Wolf; Newsted grew fond of Red Hot Chili Peppers and Faith No More, particularly the bass playing of the former's Flea; and Ulrich was enjoying Britpop groups such as Oasis. The wide range of influences proved productive for the band. By the time the proper recording sessions began, they had almost 30 completed songs. These included \"Streamline\" (\"Wasting My Hate\"), \"Load\" (\"King Nothing\"), \"Devil Dance\" (\"Devil's Dance\"), \"Fixer\" (\"Fixxxer\"), and \"Mouldy\" (\"Hero of the Day\").\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFirst we chose riffs that were great, and Lars and I would go jam on them. Then, instead of trying to force one riff with another riff, it was like, 'Let's jam on it,' and we'd see what came out of that.\u00a0... It was more of a feel thing when we were writing this stuff. So the songs kinda started writing themselves, in a way, which was a little more fun than just trying to stick a bunch of riffs together.\n\u2014James Hetfield on \"Load\"'s songwriting process, 1996\nThe recording sessions for the new album began on May 1, 1995, at The Plant Studios in Sausalito, California. The sessions reunited Metallica with producer Bob Rock and engineer Randy Staub from \"Metallica\". Despite having clashed during the production of \"Metallica\", the band and Rock had settled their differences in the following years while on tour and decided to work together again. Hetfield explained that Rock \"tends to help us dig deeper. We tell him what we're after and he tries to help us achieve that\". He credited Rock with helping him deliver stronger vocal performances. The recording atmosphere was productive, and the band's songwriting process became looser and more relaxed compared to previous albums. Hetfield attributed this to the break the band members took from each other that allowed each member to \"grow up on our own and come back with a little more respect for each other\". Newsted agreed: \"The studio thing has definitely gotten more comfortable.\u00a0... I think since everybody has their own life, separate life really strong in its own way with their own set of friends, I think we're really comfortable when we do get together and things like this.\"\nEncouraged by Ulrich, Hammett played rhythm guitar for the first time on a Metallica album, having previously only played lead parts while Hetfield played all rhythm parts. Hammett said this was done to achieve \"a looser sound\". He ultimately became more influential in the songwriting process, sharing co-writing credits with Hetfield and Ulrich on seven of the final album's fourteen tracks. Newsted, on the other hand, felt isolated as the other band members, particularly Hetfield, dismissed his song ideas. He also believed that the band's fanbase was not \"ready to hear [them] sounding like more typical hard rock and roll music\". Nevertheless, Newsted felt trapped within Metallica and began working on side projects such as IR8. An IR8 demo tape ended up being played on a San Francisco radio station, which angered Hetfield and Ulrich. Newsted nevertheless did not want bad blood between them, acknowledging Metallica as Hetfield and Ulrich's band and a carefree attitude towards songwriting credits, because \"I still put my signature on it\". At the insistence of Rock, Newsted changed his bass playing to his own style rather than doubling the guitar parts; he had begun to perform this way on \"Metallica\" but fully embraced it for \"Load\".\nMetallica worked for most of the next year with a break for the summer festival season. A short tour commenced in August, during which the band debuted two new songs, \"2 X 4\" and \"Devil's Dance\". In November, Hetfield learned of his father's cancer diagnosis and briefly departed for Wyoming to be with him, using the time away to write lyrics. The following month, Metallica made an appearance at Whisky a Go Go honoring the 50th birthday of Mot\u00f6rhead singer Lemmy, performing several Mot\u00f6rhead covers. In January 1996, with so many new songs recorded, the band decided to scrap the idea of a double album and release the material as two separate albums. This was decided for multiple reasons. Firstly, the band would have had to back out of the 1996 Lollapalooza festival to complete production of the double album. Secondly, a double album only counts as one album on your contract, according to Ulrich, so \"this way it counts as two [and] we get the pot of gold at the end even quicker!\" Lastly, the workload tired the members out. Hetfield said at the time: \"As time went on we realized that we couldn't tackle all of it at once; we were like nine months into the recording and weren't even done with half of the songs. It was too hard to focus.\" So, half the songs would be released first as \"Load\" and the other half as \"Reload\" the following year.\nConcerned about the long recording process, Elektra Records set May 1, 1996, as the mastering date for the upcoming album. From March to April 1996, the band was in New York City recording overdubs and commencing mixing at Right Track Studios, with further mixing being done at nearby Quad Recording Studios. The band invited local journalists to these sessions to hear previews of the new album. Hetfield's father died in late February 1996, after which Hetfield returned to New York to finish recording. In an interview with \"Rolling Stone\", he stated that he \"went back to when [former Metallica bassist] Cliff [Burton] died\" and \"got some of the feelings out through the music\".\n\"Load\" is Metallica's longest studio album at 78 minutes and 59 seconds in length, the maximum duration a single CD could be. The long length was marketed by Elektra through advertisements on MTV and stickers affixed to initial pressings of the album itself. \"The Outlaw Torn\" had to be shortened by one minute to fit on the album; the full version of the track was released on the \"Reload\" single \"The Memory Remains\" as \"The Outlaw Torn (Unencumbered by Manufacturing Restrictions Version)\", with a running time of 10:48.\nComposition.\nMusic.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis album and what we're doing with it\u00a0\u2013 that, to me, is what Metallica are all about: exploring different things. The minute you stop exploring, then just sit down and fucking \n\u2014Lars Ulrich on \"Load\"'s exploratory nature, 1996\n\"Load\" represented a stylistic departure for Metallica away from their thrash metal roots in favor of a hard rock sound. While the band had already taken a step away from thrash metal on \"Metallica\", they went further on \"Load\", resulting in a \"cleaner\" sound. At the time of the album's release, thrash metal had been on a decline amidst the rising grunge and alternative rock movements. The authors Joel McIver and Paul Stenning argue that with \"Load\" and its follow-up \"Reload\", Metallica recognized and adapted to a changing music scene, compared to other metal bands such as Slayer who stuck to their formula.\nPrimarily a hard rock and heavy metal album, \"Load\" features a variety of musical influences from genres such as Southern rock, blues rock, country rock, alternative rock, and grunge. Numerous critics have compared the music to 1970s-era hard rock bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Aerosmith, and ZZ Top. Metallica had listed several artists and bands they were inspired by while writing \"Load\" and \"Reload\" that took them away from their thrash roots, including Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Primus, Pantera, Ted Nugent, Oasis, and Alanis Morissette, among others; the songs \"Mama Said\" and \"Wasting My Hate\" were inspired by Hetfield's friendship with Waylon Jennings. Hetfield described \"Load\" as \"the U2 version of Metallica\".\n\"Load\" was Metallica's first album on which all tracks were down-tuned to E\u266d tuning. Hammett said it was his attempt to play like Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Thin Lizzy. Hetfield liked the change, believing the semitone drop in pitch gave his voice a \"break\". According to McIver, allowing Hammett to play rhythm guitar led to a looser, less \"metal\" and more \"rock\" sound, a result of Hetfield's growing maturity and the band's \"desire to move forward\". The band members also utilized more experimentation in their playing styles. Jon Pareles describes Ulrich's drumming as \"land[ing] with brutal certainty a nanosecond behind the beat, letting the guitars and bass claw each power chord unencumbered\". Hammett used slide guitar on \"Ain't My Bitch\" and various amplifiers to create different textures and soundscapes on \"Hero of the Day\"; Hetfield used a Talk box to perform the guitar solo on \"The House Jack Built\"; and Newsted played a fretless bass on \"Until It Sleeps\" and used different amplifier effects to achieve his bass sound on \"Thorn Within\". Hammett described his guitar solo on \"Bleeding Me\" as a summation of all his influences, \"with a good dose of my own style\".\nLyrics.\nCompared to previous albums, which touched on themes of confronting a frightening outside world, the lyrics on \"Load\" are more personal and reflective, influenced by topics such as neurosis (\"Thorn Within\", \"Poor Twisted Me\") and psychotherapy (\"Until It Sleeps\"). Hetfield maintained that he wanted the lyrics to be vague to allow for listener interpretation. Nevertheless, the lyrics are amongst the band's most personal yet, with the author Mick Wall stating that they offer insight into Hetfield's psyche; several songs are addressed at himself. \"Bleeding Me\" was an \"intensely personal\" song about some of Hetfield's biggest internal struggles. He explained that \"I was going through therapy at the time and I was so unwilling... it was like the therapist had put leeches on me just to get it all out. There was a lot of secret pain, so that song came from me experiencing therapy for the first time.\"\n\"Mama Said\" and \"Until It Sleeps\", are about the death and relationship, respectively, of Hetfield's mother, while \"Hero of the Day\" offers \"estranged youth\" and \"mother-and-child\" themes. Death and pain is also the main subject of \"The Outlaw Torn\". Religion also impacted some of the lyrics, such as on \"Thorn Within\". \"Ronnie\" concerns a shooting that occurred in Washington state in 1995. The author Beno\u00eet Clerc believes it may have been inspired by the story of Ronnie Long, an African-American imprisoned for a crime he did not commit in 1976, eventually being released in 2020.\nArtwork and packaging.\nThe cover of \"Load\" is an original artwork titled \"Semen and Blood III\". It is one of three photographic studies created by New York artist Andres Serrano in 1990 by mingling bovine blood and his own semen between two sheets of Plexiglas. Hammett came across the photo in an art book of Serrano's work titled \"Body and Soul\" that he purchased from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. He said at the time that at first glance, he thought it resembled hot-rod flames due to a similar tattoo he had. Recalling the abstract art and psychedelia of a 1960s gig poster, the image depicts an amoeba-like blend of strawberry-red and creamy white tones swirling against a mottled black background. Serrano had known of the band but was unaware of their music. He appreciated the collaboration and believed it would help expand his audience. Hammett wanted the picture as \"Load\"'s cover artwork because he thought it was \"beautiful\" and \"it was the form, not the content, that was great\". One of Serrano's artworks was also used for the cover of \"Load\"'s follow-up \"Reload\" the following year.\nNot all band members liked the photo. While Ulrich loved it, Newsted hated it and refused to discuss it in interviews. Hammett believed Newsted \"cared too much about what the fans think\", although he did not want fan reactions to \"dictate or censor\" what he did. Hetfield felt indifferent about the artwork and was more concerned about potential backlash from retailers who would refuse to sell the album over the cover. In 2009, Hetfield expressed his dislike of the artwork, calling it a \"piss-take\" around art made \"for the sake of shocking others\". Due to the band's differing views, a compromise was reached wherein the artwork's title would not appear in the album's liner notes, but Serrano remained credited as the cover artist. In a 2018 interview, Ulrich maintained his appreciation for the \"Load\" and \"Reload\" covers, calling them his favorite Metallica album covers.\n\"Load\" featured a new Metallica logo that simplified and modernized its appearance, going from \"metal\" to \"alternative\". The album booklet featured photographs of the band by former U2 and Depeche Mode collaborator Anton Corbijn. With \"Load\", the band adopted a new image that strayed away from their metal roots. They wore short hair, tailored shirts, leather jackets, and make-up. At certain press events, Hammett and Ulrich kissed each other.\nRelease and promotion.\nWhen \"Load\" was unveiled in May 1996, fan reactions were mixed, with many criticizing Metallica's new image and change in sound. Some regarded it as a betrayal of the band's heavy metal roots. Hammett said: \"I think we made a really fucking great album, and people aren't going to walk away from our music even if they think we look like 'poofs'. At the end of the day, it all begins and ends with the music. I think we're now much more than a heavy metal band.\" In a 1999 interview, Ulrich described the heavy-metal audience as \"very conservative\" and resistant to change, saying, \"If at the end of the day someone's opinion of us comes down to whether we're wearing leather jackets, then they shouldn't be buying the records.\" In 2022, Rock commended the band for not caring what the fans think and doing \"what they feel is right for them\".\n\"Load\" was released on June 4, 1996, through Elektra Records in the United States and Vertigo Records in the United Kingdom and Europe, in CD, cassette, and double LP formats. The album was a commercial success, debuting and spending four consecutive weeks at number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart. The album sold 680,000 units in its first week, making it the biggest opening week for Metallica as well as the biggest debut of 1996. It was certified 5\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping five million copies in the United States. \"Load\" also attained number one positions in the UK, Australia, Austria, Belgium Flanders, Czech Republic, Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Sweden, and Switzerland. \"Load\" reached number two in Belgium Wallonia, Ireland, Italy, and Spain, and number eight in Zimbabwe. Nevertheless, according to Wall, overall sales were less than half of \"Metallica\".\nSingles.\n\"Until It Sleeps\" was released as the lead single on May 20, 1996. Its avant-garde music video, directed by Samuel Bayer, displays the band in their new image and features neo-biblical imagery, including references to the Hieronymus Bosch paintings \"The Garden of Earthly Delights\", \"The Haywain\", and \"Ecce Homo\". The video won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video in 1996. The single became Metallica's first \u2013 and to date only \u2013 top ten single on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, as well as the band's second top five in the UK, with number one positions in Australia, Sweden, and Finland. \"Hero of the Day\" was released as the second single on September 10. Its music video, directed by Anton Corbijn, centers on a \"drugged-up kid\" staring at a television while \"Load\"-themed channels play, all featuring the Metallica members. It stalled on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 60, but was the band's second number-one single on the Mainstream Rock chart after \"Until It Sleeps\".\n\"Mama Said\" appeared as the third single on November 25. Its music video, also directed by Corbijn, features Hetfield playing the song on an acoustic guitar sitting alone in the back seat of a car. He travels down a metaphorical highway while the other three members peer at him through the windows. At the end, it is revealed it was a back seat prop in a studio, after which Hetfield and a white horse walk off-screen. It reached number 19 in the UK. The fourth and final single, \"King Nothing\", was released in the US and Canada only on January 7, 1997. It was promoted by a music video directed by Matt Mahurin. It reached number 90 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number six on the Mainstream Rock chart.\nTour.\nMetallica performed various fanclub-only shows in June, after which they performed at the 1996 Lollapalooza festival. Metallica's appearance at the festival was controversial; longtime fans of the band accused them of selling out, while regular festival attendees believed their appearance was hijacking the music and culture the festival had been originally designed to reject. Metallica performed at the festival as a headliner, sharing the bill with Soundgarden, the Ramones, Rancid, and Screaming Trees.\nAfter the Lollapalooza shows, Metallica embarked on the Poor Touring Me tour, which spanned 19 countries and ran 125 concerts from September 6, 1996, to May 28, 1997. According to Newsted, \"We wanted to take the music to a new generation of Metallica fans.\" The tour began in Europe, where the band made appearances on the British television show \"Later... with Jools Holland\" and at the European MTV Awards in November. The American leg began in late December and spanned the entire United States and Canada. The band enjoyed their time on the road, with Ulrich stating the band was in the best physical and mental shapes of their career. Ulrich and Hetfield married their respective girlfriends in January and August 1997, respectively.\nAt the end of the tour, Metallica announced \"Load\"'s follow-up album, \"Reload\", to be released in November. \"Reload\" was composed of outtakes from the \"Load\" sessions, with additional recording sessions taking place from July to October 1997. Upon its release, like \"Load\", \"Reload\" was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200.\nCritical reception.\n\"Load\" received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Positive reviews praised the band's performances and welcomed the change in sound. \"Musician\" magazine's Mac Randall said that \"The boys are more into cohesion now, more interested in the slow increase of momentum.\" \"Rolling Stone\"'s David Fricke believed that longtime fans should get over the change in image and appreciate the band's growth with \"easily the heaviest record of the year\". \"Q\" enthused, \"These boys set up their tents in the darkest place of all, in the naked horror of their own heads... Metallica are still awesome... What is new is streamlined attack, the focus and, yes, the tunes.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s David Browne wrote that the band \"approach each song on \"Load\" with grim, teeth-gritting determination\" and exhibit \"subtle\" signs of emotional growth. \"Kerrang!\" editor Phil Alexander wrote that Metallica has \"let their individual talents breathe\" and with \"Load\", the band \"still tower over the competition with audacity and power\".\nOthers were more mixed on \"Load\". Some critics felt that the band's experimentations made them less forward-thinking and conventional, failing to push the band forward creatively. Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" remarked that \"for the first time, Metallica sounds as if it's looking over its shoulder, wondering where it fits in the era of grunge\". Howard Cohen of the \"Miami Herald\" felt that \"Load\" sounded \"tame\" compared to Metallica's previous records, which Browne attributed to the \"clean but parched production\". \"Melody Maker\" expressed reservations about \"Load\"'s heaviness compared to its predecessors: \"A Metallica album is traditionally an exhausting event. It should rock you to exhaustion, leave you brutalised and drained. This one is no exception. It is, however, the first Metallica album to make me wonder at any point, 'What the fuck was that?' It's as if the jackboot grinding the human face were to take occasional breaks for a pedicure.\" In \"The Village Voice\", Robert Christgau said \"this is just a metal record with less solo room, which is good because it concentrates their chops, and more singing, which isn't because they can't.\" AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered \"Load\" repetitive, uninteresting and poorly executed. One of Metallica's contemporaries, Slayer's Kerry King, expressed his dislike for \"Load\" in a 1996 interview with \"Kerrang!\" magazine, saying that the music lacks \"attitude\" and \"fire\".\nLegacy.\nOpinions on \"Load\" and \"Reload\" have been mixed in the years and decades following its release. Both albums have typically placed low in lists ranking Metallica's studio albums. Many commentators agree that \"Load\" is bloated and overlong. The author Paul Stenning wrote that several songs sound like extended jams rather than having coherent structures. \"Metal Hammer\"'s Paul Brannigan said that \"Load\"'s main fault was \"quality control\", containing tracks that can be considered \"throwaway\" and \"mediocre\". Some have argued \"Load\" and \"Reload\" could have been one \"pretty good\" album but the band was \"too loose\" regarding editing. In his 2004 biography of the band, Joel McIver argues that with the experimentation, Metallica lost sight of themselves and what they succeed at best: \"heavy metal with power, aggression, and kill\". Others have shown appreciation for \"Load\". In 2022, \"Louder\"'s Terry Bezer called the album underrated and Metallica's \"last great album\". The following year, \"Loudwire\"'s Jon Wiederhorn argued that the songs on \"Load\" are \"solid and well-composed\" and the album rewards repeated listens.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n[We were] trying to be something we weren't and that confused us even further musically. There's quite a few great songs on there that could have been greater if the cover and the pictures were different I think. A lot of the fans got turned off quite a bit from the music but mostly, I think, from the image. It just doesn't work. You absolutely have to evolve, but let's have it evolve naturally. It didn't seem natural to \n\u2014James Hetfield, 2003\nThe band has held mixed opinions on the \"Load\" and \"Reload\" period in subsequent decades. Hetfield felt he was following Hammett and Ulrich's vision and did not believe in the idea of revamping their image. He felt that the large number of songs \"diluted the potency of the poison of Metallica\". Hetfield also believed that former bassist Cliff Burton, if still alive, would likely have disapproved of the direction the band took for the two albums. Nevertheless, Hetfield did not regret the period because it \"felt like the right thing to do\" at the time. When interviewed in 2002, Ulrich said he liked some of the material from \"Load\" and \"Reload\" and was more disappointed that fans reacted poorly to the music based on the band members' new image rather than the music itself. By 2003, Ulrich agreed that the two albums could have been condensed into one, but felt that at the time, he and Hetfield wanted to release all the newly-written songs and lacked \"an edit button on our instrument panel\". Reflecting on \"Load\", Hammett said that pushing boundaries and surprising fans is part of Metallica's creative identity. He acknowledged that taking risks can either be rewarding or damaging, but ultimately, the band stayed true to themselves by experimenting and letting the music guide them. Bob Rock also remained proud of \"Load\" and \"Reload\", believing it would have been wrong to copy \"Metallica\". Speaking in 2025, Rock said: \"Those records are on par with everything else that we've done creatively... I'm very proud of those records.\"\nReissue.\n\"Load\" was reissued as a super deluxe box set on June 13, 2025. Described in a press release as \"an ambitious and comprehensive time capsule of 1995\u20131997 era Metallica\", the super deluxe set includes previously unreleased demos, rough mixes, videos, live recordings, and more. The physical release is spread across 15 CDs, six vinyl records, four DVDs, a 128-page hardcover book, and additional materials. The reissue also includes a new remaster of the original album by Reuben Cohen and the original extended version of \"The Outlaw Torn\", which was edited down due to manufacturing limits.\nReviewing the deluxe box set for \"Pitchfork\", Drew Millard enjoyed the live material, believing the \"Load\" tracks blended seamlessly with their older material. He also praised the addition of the band's 1995 live Mot\u00f6rhead covers performed at the Whisky a Go Go for Lemmy's 50th birthday. Discussing \"Load\" itself, Millard called it the band's first misstep in their career, but one that was respectable in retrospect, writing: \"There is dignity in flagrant, unnecessary failure.\" \"Rolling Stone\"'s Joe Gross also praised the live material in the box set, including the band's 1996 Lollapalooza gig. He summarized that \"Load\" \"remains a reminder of a very specific musical moment, when the various competing versions of rock remained a subject of vigorous debate: Metallica threw on some makeup and stoked the flames.\"\nPersonnel.\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes, except where noted.\nMetallica\nAdditional musician\nProduction\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCharts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was released on November 24, 1998, through Elektra Records. It includes cover songs, B-side covers, and \"The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisited\", which had gone out of print since its original release in 1987. The title is a combination of \"Garage Days Revisited\" and Metallica's song \"Damage, Inc.\", from \"Master of Puppets\". The album's graphical cover draws heavily from the 1987 EP. The album features songs by artists that have influenced Metallica, including many bands from new wave of British heavy metal, hardcore punk bands and popular songs.\nProduction.\nThe day after Metallica finished the North American leg of the Poor Re-Touring Me Tour in San Diego's Coors Amphitheatre, they hit the studio to start recording a new album of cover versions. As Lars Ulrich explained, the band wanted to do something different after \"three pretty serious albums in a row, starting with the Black album and then \"Load\" and \"ReLoad\"\", and the process would be easier by working with covers, especially as the band had a tradition of taking other people's songs and \"[turning] them into something very Metallica, different from what the original artist did\". Given that the band had recorded many covers that were spread across various releases, such as B-sides of their singles and the 1987 EP \"The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisited\", the band would \"put them all in a nice little packaging for easy listening\" along with the newly recorded cover versions, chosen through a group decision. Only one of the eleven songs in the \"New Recordings '98\" disk was not done in the three-week sessions, a version of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Tuesday's Gone\" the band recorded for a radio broadcast along with friends such as Les Claypool, John Popper and Gary Rossington.\nGarage Barrage Tour.\nMetallica played five shows in November 1998 to support the album's release. Embracing the cover song concept, the band's setlist consisted entirely of cover songs from throughout their career. Metallica's own music was presented by the opening band, Battery, a Metallica tribute band.\nPackaging.\nThe cover for \"Garage Inc.\" had an Anton Corbijn photograph of Metallica dressed as mechanics. The band wanted the booklet to hold a detailed account of the contents of the project, and designer Andy Airfix was allowed to search through Ulrich's catalogue of Metallica memorabilia in San Francisco to create a 32-page booklet. Airfix also did the back cover, where the front of \"Garage Days Re-Revisited\" was modified with headshots of Metallica in 1998 and the track list written on tracing paper.\nTrack listing.\nDisc one.\nThese tracks (except \"Tuesday's Gone\"; see below) were recorded in September\u2013October 1998 for the \"Garage Inc.\" album.\nDisc two.\nThese tracks are a collection of B-sides from artists Metallica were inspired by, throughout the early years of the band.\nPersonnel.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTechnical personnel\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCharts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSales and certifications.\nIn the U.S., \"Garage Inc.\" sold 426,500 units in the first week of release, making Metallica's fourth straight debut surpassing 400,000 copies.

{"id": "18764", "revid": "15482012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18764", "title": "S&amp;M (album)", "text": "S&amp;M (an abbreviation of Symphony and Metallica) is a live album by American heavy metal band Metallica, with the San Francisco Symphony conducted by Michael Kamen. It was recorded on April 21 and 22, 1999, at The Berkeley Community Theatre. This is the final Metallica album to feature bassist Jason Newsted.\nAlbum information.\n\"S&amp;M\" contains performances of Metallica songs with additional symphonic accompaniment, composed by Michael Kamen, who also conducted the orchestra during the concert. According to James Hetfield, the idea to combine heavy metal with an epic classical approach was Cliff Burton's idea. His love of classical music, especially of Johann Sebastian Bach, can be found in many instrumental parts and melodic characteristics in Metallica's songwriting, including songs from \"Ride the Lightning\" (1984) and \"Master of Puppets\" (1986). Kamen, who arranged and conducted the orchestral background tracks for \"Nothing Else Matters\", met the band at the 1992 Grammy award show for the first time, and after hearing the \"Elevator version\" of the song, suggested the band perform with a whole orchestra; the band, however, did not take him up on the offer until seven years later. Lars Ulrich's favorite band Deep Purple, whom he colorfully inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016, is noted for having kicked off this kind of approach 30 years before, in \"Concerto for Group and Orchestra\" (1969), although it had actually been done multiple times before, most notably with the Moody Blues' \"Days of Future Passed\" in 1967. German power metal band Rage also released Lingua Mortis in 1996, an album in collaboration with the Lingua Mortis Orchestra.\nIn addition to songs from previous albums spanning \"Ride the Lightning\" through \"Reload\", there are two new compositions: \"No Leaf Clover\" and \"\u2212Human\". \"The Ecstasy of Gold\" by Ennio Morricone, Metallica's entrance music, was played live by the orchestra. \"No Leaf Clover\" has since been performed by Metallica in concert, using a recording of the orchestral prelude.\nChanges were made to the lyrics of some songs, most notably the removal of the second verse and chorus of \"The Thing That Should Not Be\" and playing the third verse in its place.\nThe \"S\" in the stylized \"S&amp;M\" on the album cover is a backwards treble clef, while the \"M\" is taken from Metallica's logo.\nCommercial performance.\n\"S&amp;M\" sold 300,000 units in the first week of release, and went on to sell a total of 2.5\u00a0million copies in the US. As of 2003,[ [update]] the album had been certified 5\u00d7 platinum.\n20th anniversary.\nAfter Kamen's death in 2003, Metallica did not revisit the S&amp;M concept until 2019, when they performed with the San Francisco Symphony, headed by Michael Tilson Thomas, at the Chase Center on the 6th and the 8th of September. The shows included many songs from the original S&amp;M performances, as well as renditions of songs that had been released since then. In August, it was announced that a film of the concerts would receive a limited worldwide theatrical release. The concert was given a limited release and has grossed over 5.5\u00a0million dollars. In August 2020, the band released the two 20th anniversary performances as an album, video, and box set entitled \"S&amp;M2\".\nVideo release.\nMetallica also filmed and released the concert in DVD and VHS with direction by Wayne Isham. The VHS set has only the concert video, while the double DVD set has 5.1 sound (also: 2.0 band+orchestra, 2.0 band-only and 2.0 orchestra-only), 41 minute documentary about the concert, and two \"No Leaf Clover\" music videos: \"Slice &amp; Dice\" version and the \"Maestro Edit\". The DVD also contains four songs with multi-angles where each band member can be viewed individually: \"Of Wolf and Man\", \"Fuel\", \"Sad But True\", and \"Enter Sandman\".\nPersonnel.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSan Francisco Symphony\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTechnical personnel\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChart positions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "18787", "revid": "20764880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18787", "title": "Metallica", "text": "American heavy metal band\nMetallica is an American heavy metal band. It was formed in Los Angeles in 1981 by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding \"big four\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine, who formed Megadeth after being fired from Metallica, and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.\nMetallica first found commercial success with the release of its third album, \"Master of Puppets\" (1986), which is often cited as one of the best metal albums of all time. The band's next album, \"...And Justice for All\" (1988), gave Metallica its first Grammy Award nomination. Its fifth album, \"Metallica\" (1991), was a turning point for the band that saw it transition from its thrash metal roots; the album appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and selling more than 16\u00a0million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica returned to its thrash metal roots with its ninth album, \"Death Magnetic\" (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier albums. The band's eleventh and most recent album, \"72 Seasons\", was released in 2023.\nIn 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster, in which the band and several other artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent, eventually reaching a settlement. Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film ', which documented the troubled production of the band's eighth album, \"St. Anger\" (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band co-wrote the screenplay for and starred alongside Dane DeHaan in the 2013 concert film ', in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline.\nMetallica is one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold more than 163\u00a0million albums worldwide as of 2023[ [update]], and is the third-best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, having sold 58\u00a0million albums in the United States as of 2017[ [update]]. The band has released eleven studio albums, four live albums (including two performances with the San Francisco Symphony), twelve video albums, one cover album, two extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos. Metallica has won ten Grammy Awards from 26 nominations and had six consecutive studio albums, from \"Metallica\" through \"Hardwired... to Self-Destruct\" (2016), debut at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines such as \"Rolling Stone\", which ranked the band in 61st place on its list of 100 greatest artists of all time.\nHistory.\n1981\u20131984: Formation, early years, and \"Kill 'Em All\".\nMetallica was formed in Los Angeles in late 1981 when Danish drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper, \"The Recycler\", in which the advertisement read, \"Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden.\" Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album, \"Metal Massacre\". Slagel accepted. The band was officially formed on October 28, 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met.\nThe band name came from Ulrich's friend Ron Quintana, who was thinking of names for a fanzine and was considering \"MetalMania\" or \"Metallica\". After hearing the two names, Ulrich wanted the latter for his band, so he suggested Quintana use \"MetalMania\" instead. Dave Mustaine replied to an advertisement for a lead guitarist; Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him after seeing his expensive guitar equipment.\nHetfield took vocal duties at the band's first gig, which took place in March 1982 at Radio City in Anaheim with newly recruited bassist Ron McGovney. They were chosen to open for British heavy metal band Saxon at the second gig of their 1982 U.S. tour.\nMetallica recorded its first demo, \"Power Metal\", whose name was inspired by McGovney's early business cards, in early 1982. The band played as a five-piece at their fourth gig, which took place in April 1982 in Costa Mesa with lead guitarist Brad Parker, though he did not last. According to Mustaine, the band was \"fed up\" with auditioning guitar players and Hetfield became the de facto guitarist, in addition to the vocalist. Hetfield played guitar live for the first time at the band's fifth gig, in May 1982. \"Metal Massacre I\" was released on June 14, 1982; early pressings listed the band incorrectly as \"Mettallica\", which angered the band. Hetfield sang and played both bass and rhythm guitar, while Lars Ulrich played drums and Lloyd Grant was credited with a guitar solo.\nThe term \"thrash metal\" was coined in February 1984 by \"Kerrang!\" journalist Malcolm Dome in reference to Anthrax's song \"Metal Thrashing Mad\". Prior to this, Hetfield referred to Metallica's sound as \"power metal\". In late 1982, Ulrich and Hetfield attended a show at the West Hollywood nightclub Whisky a Go Go, which featured bassist Cliff Burton in the band Trauma. The two were \"blown away\" by Burton's use of a wah-wah pedal and asked him to join Metallica. Hetfield and Mustaine wanted McGovney to leave because they thought he \"didn't contribute anything, he just followed.\" Although Burton initially declined the offer, by the end of the year, he had accepted on the condition that the band move to El Cerrito in the San Francisco Bay Area. Metallica's first live performance with Burton was at the nightclub The Stone in March 1983, and the first recording to feature Burton was the \"Megaforce\" demo (1983).\nMetallica was ready to record their debut album, but when Metal Blade was unable to cover the cost, they began looking for other options. Concert promoter Jonathan \"Jonny Z\" Zazula, who had heard the demo \"No Life 'til Leather\" (1982), offered to broker a record deal between Metallica and New York City\u2013based record labels. After those record labels showed no interest, Zazula borrowed enough money to cover the recording budget and signed Metallica to his own label, Megaforce Records.\nIn May 1983, Metallica traveled to Rochester, New York, to record its debut album, \"Metal Up Your Ass\", which was produced by Paul Curcio. The other members decided to eject Mustaine from the band because of his drug and alcohol abuse and violent behavior just before the recording sessions on April 11, 1983. Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett replaced Mustaine the same afternoon. Metallica's first live performance with Hammett was on April 16, 1983, at a nightclub in Dover, New Jersey, called The Showplace; the support act was Anthrax's original lineup, which included Dan Lilker and Neil Turbin. This was the first time the two bands performed live together.\nMustaine, who went on to form Megadeth, has expressed his dislike for Hammett in interviews, saying Hammett \"stole\" his job. Mustaine was \"pissed off\" because he believes Hammett became popular by playing guitar leads that Mustaine had actually written. In a 1985 interview with \"Metal Forces\", Mustaine said, \"It's real funny how Kirk Hammett ripped off every lead break I'd played on that \"No Life 'til Leather\" tape and got voted No.\u00a01 guitarist in your magazine.\" On Megadeth's debut album, \"Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!\" (1985), Mustaine included the song \"Mechanix\", which Metallica had previously reworked and retitled \"The Four Horsemen\" on \"Kill 'Em All\". Mustaine said he did this to \"straighten Metallica up,\" because Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and said he could not play guitar.\nBecause of conflicts with its record label and the distributors' refusal to release an album titled \"Metal Up Your Ass\", the album was renamed \"Kill 'Em All\". It was released on Megaforce Records in the U.S. and on Music for Nations in Europe, and peaked at number 155 on the \"Billboard\"\u00a0200 in 1986. Although the album was not initially a financial success, it earned Metallica a growing fan base in the underground metal scene. To support the release, Metallica embarked on the \"Kill 'Em All for One\" tour with Raven. In February 1984, Metallica supported Venom on the Seven Dates of Hell tour, during which the bands performed in front of 7,000 people at the Aardschok Festival in Zwolle, Netherlands.\n1984\u20131986: \"Ride the Lightning\", \"Master of Puppets\", and Burton's death.\nMetallica recorded its second studio album, \"Ride the Lightning\", at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark, from February to March 1984. It was released on July 27, 1984 and reached number 100 on the \"Billboard\"\u00a0200. A French printing press mistakenly printed green covers for the album, which are now considered collector's items. Mustaine received writing co-credit for \"Ride the Lightning\" and \"The Call of Ktulu\".\nElektra Records A&amp;R director Michael Alago and co-founder of Q Prime management, Cliff Burnstein, attended a Metallica concert in September 1984; they were impressed with the performance, signed Metallica to Elektra and made the band a client of Q Prime. Metallica's growing success was such that the band's British label, Music for Nations, released \"Creeping Death\" as a limited-edition single, which sold 40,000 copies as an import in the U.S. Two of the three songs on the record \u2013 cover versions of Diamond Head's \"Am I Evil?\" and Blitzkrieg's \"Blitzkrieg\" \u2013 appeared on the 1988 Elektra reissue of \"Kill 'Em All\". Metallica embarked on its first major European tour with Tank to an average crowd of 1,300. Returning to the U.S., it embarked on a co-headlining tour with W.A.S.P. and support from Armored Saint. Metallica played its largest show at the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park, England, on August 17, 1985, with Bon Jovi and Ratt, playing to 70,000 people. At a show in Oakland, California, at the Day on the Green festival, the band played to a crowd of 60,000.\nMetallica's third studio album, \"Master of Puppets\", was recorded at Sweet Silence Studios from September to December 1985 and released on March 3, 1986. The album reached number 29 on the \"Billboard\"\u00a0200 and spent 72 weeks on the chart. It was the band's first album to be certified Gold on November 4, 1986, and was certified six times Platinum in 2003. Steve Huey of AllMusic considered the album \"the band's greatest achievement\". Following the release of the album, Metallica supported Ozzy Osbourne on a U.S. tour. Hetfield broke his wrist while skateboarding; he continued with the tour, performing vocals, with guitar technician John Marshall playing rhythm guitar.\nOn September 27, 1986, during the European leg of Metallica's Damage, Inc. Tour, members drew cards to determine which bunks on the tour bus they would sleep in. Burton won and chose to sleep in Hammett's bunk. At around sunrise near D\u00f6rarp, Sweden, the bus driver lost control and skidded, which caused the bus to overturn several times. Ulrich, Hammett and Hetfield sustained no serious injuries; however, Burton was pinned under the bus and died. Hetfield said:\nI saw the bus lying right on him. I saw his legs sticking out. I freaked. The bus driver, I recall, was trying to yank the blanket out from under him to use for other people. I just went, \"Don't fucking do that!\" I already wanted to kill the [bus driver]. I don't know if he was drunk or if he hit some ice. All I knew was, he was driving and Cliff wasn't alive anymore.\n1986\u20131994: Newsted joins, \"...And Justice for All\" and \"Metallica\".\nBurton's death left Metallica's future in doubt. The three remaining members decided Burton would want them to carry on, and with the Burton family's blessings, the band sought a replacement. Roughly 40 people \u2013 including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus; Troy Gregory of Prong; and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam \u2013 auditioned for the band to fill Burton's spot. Newsted learned Metallica's entire setlist; after the audition, Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; his first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi. The band finished its tour in February 1987.\nAfter Newsted joined Metallica, the band left their El Cerrito practice space \u2013 a suburban house formerly rented by sound engineer Mark Whitaker and dubbed \"the Metalli-mansion\" \u2013 and relocated to the adjacent cities of Berkeley and Albany before eventually settling in the Marin County city of San Rafael, north of San Francisco. In March 1987, Hetfield again broke his wrist while skateboarding, forcing the band to cancel an appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\". On August 21, 1987, an all-covers extended play (EP), titled \"The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisited\", was released. The EP was recorded in an effort to use the band's newly constructed recording studio, test Newsted's talents, and to relieve grief and stress following the death of Burton. A video titled \"Cliff 'Em All\" commemorating Burton's three years in Metallica was released in 1987; the video included bass solos, home videos and pictures.\nMetallica's first studio album since Burton's death, \"...And Justice for All\", was recorded from January to May 1988 and released in September. The album was a commercial success, reaching number 6 on the \"Billboard\"\u00a0200, and was the band's first album to enter the top 10. The album was certified Platinum nine weeks after its release. There were complaints about the production, however; Steve Huey of AllMusic said Ulrich's drums were clicking more than thudding, and the guitars \"buzz thinly\". The lack of audible bass in the album also drew widespread criticism. To promote the album, Metallica embarked on a tour called Damaged Justice.\nIn 1989, Metallica received its first Grammy Award nomination for \"...And Justice for All\" in the new Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrument category. Metallica was the favorite to win, but the award was given to Jethro Tull for the album \"Crest of a Knave\". The award was controversial with fans and the press; Metallica was standing off-stage waiting to receive the award after performing the song \"One\". Jethro Tull had been advised by its manager not to attend the ceremony because he was expecting Metallica to win. The award was named in \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s \"Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets\" list.\nFollowing the release of \"...And Justice for All\", Metallica released its debut music video for the song \"One\", which the band performed in an abandoned warehouse. The footage was remixed with the film \"Johnny Got His Gun\". Rather than organize an ongoing licensing deal, Metallica purchased the rights to the film. The remixed video was submitted to MTV with an alternative, performance-only version that was held back in case MTV banned the remixed version. MTV accepted the remixed version; the video was viewers' first exposure to Metallica. In 1999, it was voted number 38 in MTV's \"Top 100 Videos of All Time\" countdown and was featured on the network's 25th-anniversary edition of \"ADD Video\", which showcased the most popular videos on MTV in the last 25 years.\nIn October 1990, Metallica entered One on One Recording's studio in North Hollywood to record its next album. Bob Rock, who had worked with Aerosmith, the Cult, Bon Jovi and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, was hired as the producer. \"Metallica\" \u2013 also known as \"The Black Album\" \u2013 was remixed three times, cost US$1\u00a0million, and ended Hammett and Ulrich's marriages. Although the release was delayed until 1991, \"Metallica\" debuted at number one in 10 countries, selling 650,000 units in the U.S. during its first week. The album marked a change in Metallica's musical style and brought the band mainstream attention; it has been certified 16 times Platinum in the U.S., which makes it the 25th-best-selling album in the country. The making of \"Metallica\" and the following tour was documented in \"A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica\". The tour in support of the album, called the Wherever We May Roam Tour, lasted 14 months and included dates in the U.S., Japan and the U.K. In September 1991, 1.6\u00a0million rock music fans converged in Moscow to enjoy the first open-air rock concert to be held in the Soviet Union; it was part of the Monsters of Rock series. In April 1992, Metallica appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and performed a three-song set. Hetfield later performed \"Stone Cold Crazy\" with the remaining members of Queen and Tony Iommi.\nOn August 8, 1992, during the co-headlining Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour at the Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Hetfield suffered second and third-degree burns to his arms, face, hands and legs. There had been some confusion with the new pyrotechnics setup, which resulted in Hetfield walking into a flame during \"Fade to Black\". Newsted said Hetfield's skin was \"bubbling like on \"The Toxic Avenger\"\". Metallica returned to the stage seventeen days later with guitar technician and Metal Church member John Marshall replacing Hetfield on guitar for the remainder of the tour, although Hetfield was able to sing. Later in 1993, Metallica went on the Nowhere Else to Roam Tour, playing five shows in Mexico City. \"\", the band's first box set, was released in November 1993. The collection contains three live CDs, three home videos, and a book filled with riders and letters.\n1994\u20132001: \"Load\", \"Reload\", Napster controversy and Newsted's departure.\nAfter almost three years of touring to promote \"Metallica\", including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, which comprised three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy? and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of \"Load\" in 1996. \"Load\" debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\"\u00a0200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number one album. The cover art, \"Blood and Semen III\", was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release saw another change in the band's musical direction and a new image, which included a revamped logo and the band members having their hair cut. While \"Load\" was a commercial success, the band's change in style had polarized their fanbase. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996.\nDuring early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album, titled \"Reload\". The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. \"Reload\", too, debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\"\u00a0200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film \"\" that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \"polished and reworked\" until judged releasable. To promote \"Reload\", Metallica performed \"Fuel\" and \"The Memory Remains\" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" in December 1997.\nIn 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, titled \"Garage Inc.\" The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy, Mercyful Fate, Black Sabbath and others, and the second disc featured the original version of \"The $5.98 E.P. \u2013 Garage Days Re-Revisited\", which had become a scarce collector's item. The album entered the \"Billboard\"\u00a0200 at number two.\nOn April 21 and 22, 1999, Metallica recorded two performances with the San Francisco Symphony, which was conducted by Michael Kamen, who had previously worked with producer Rock on \"Nothing Else Matters\". Kamen approached Metallica in 1991 with the idea of pairing the band's music with a symphony orchestra. Kamen and his staff of over 100 composed additional orchestral material for Metallica songs. Metallica wrote two new Kamen-scored songs for the event: \"No Leaf Clover\" and \"-Human\". The audio recording and concert footage were released in 1999 as the album and concert film \"S&amp;M\". It entered the \"Billboard\"\u00a0200 at number two and the Australian ARIA charts and Top Internet Albums chart at number one.\nIn 2000, Metallica discovered that a demo of its song \"I Disappear\", which was supposed to be released in combination with the , was receiving radio airplay. Tracing the source of the leak, the band found the file on the Napster peer-to-peer file-sharing network and also found that the band's entire catalogue was freely available. Metallica filed a lawsuit at the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, alleging that Napster violated three areas of the law: copyright infringement, unlawful use of digital audio interface device and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).\nUlrich provided a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding copyright infringement on July 11, 2000. Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered the site to place a filter on the program within 72 hours or be shut down. A settlement between Metallica and Napster was reached when German media conglomerate Bertelsmann BMG showed interest in purchasing the rights to Napster for $94\u00a0million. Under the terms of settlement, Napster agreed to block users who shared music by artists who do not want their music shared. On June 3, 2002, Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale of Napster to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets, according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.\nAt the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Ulrich appeared with host Marlon Wayans in a skit that criticized the idea of using Napster to share music. Wayans played a college student listening to Metallica's \"I Disappear\". Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation, and he responded to Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just \"sharing\" by saying that Wayans' idea of sharing was \"borrowing things that were not yours without asking.\" He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost naked in an empty room. Napster creator Shawn Fanning responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt that read: \"I borrowed this shirt from a friend. Maybe, if I like it, I'll buy one of my own.\" Ulrich was later booed on stage at the award show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink-182.\nNewsted left Metallica on January 17, 2001, just as plans were being made to enter the recording studio. He said he left the band for \"private and personal reasons, and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love.\" During a \"Playboy\" interview with Metallica, Newsted said he wanted to release an album with his side project, Echobrain. Hetfield was opposed to the idea and said, \"When someone does a side project, it takes away from the strength of Metallica\" and that a side project is \"like cheating on your wife in a way.\" Newsted said Hetfield had recorded vocals for a song used in the film \"\", and appeared on one Corrosion of Conformity album, Wiseblood. Hetfield replied: \"My name isn't on those records. And I'm not out trying to sell them\" and raised questions such as, \"Where would it end? Does he start touring with it? Does he sell shirts? Is it his band?\"\n2001\u20132006: \"Some Kind of Monster\", \"St. Anger\", and Trujillo joins.\nIn April 2001, filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky began following Metallica to document the recording process of the band's next studio album. Over two years they recorded more than 1,000 hours of footage. On July 19, 2001, before preparations to enter the recording studio, Hetfield entered rehab to treat his \"alcoholism and other addictions\". All recording plans were put on hold and the band's future was in doubt. Hetfield left rehab on December 4, 2001, and the band returned to the recording studio on April 12, 2002. Hetfield was required to limit his work to four hours a day between noon and 4\u00a0pm, and to spend the rest of his time with his family. The footage recorded by Berlinger and Sinofsky was compiled into the documentary \"\", which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004. In the documentary, Newsted said his former bandmates' decision to hire a therapist to help solve their problems which he felt they could have solved on their own was \"really fucking lame and weak\".\nIn June 2003, Metallica's eighth studio album, \"St. Anger\", debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\"\u00a0200, and drew mixed reactions from critics. Ulrich's \"steely\" sounding snare drum and the absence of guitar solos received particular criticism. Kevin Forest Moreau of \"Shakingthrough.net\" said, \"the guitars stumble in a monotone of mid-level, processed rattle; the drums don't propel as much as struggle to disguise an all-too-turgid pace; and the rage is both unfocused and leavened with too much narcissistic navel-gazing\". Brent DiCrescenzo of \"Pitchfork\" described it as \"an utter mess\". However, \"Blender\" magazine called it the \"grimiest and grimmest of the band's Bob Rock productions\", and \"New York Magazine\" called it \"utterly raw and rocking\". The title track, \"St. Anger\", won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2004; it was used as the official theme song for WWE's \"SummerSlam 2003\".\nFor the duration of \"St. Anger\"'s recording period, producer Bob Rock played bass on the album and in several live shows at which Metallica performed during that time. Once the record was completed, the band started to hold auditions for Newsted's permanent replacement. Bassists Pepper Keenan, Jeordie White, Scott Reeder, Eric Avery, Danny Lohner, and Chris Wyse\u2014among others\u2014auditioned for the role. After three months of auditions, Robert Trujillo, formerly of Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy Osbourne's band, was chosen as the new bassist. Newsted, who had joined Canadian thrash metal band Voivod by that time, was Trujillo's replacement in Osbourne's band during the 2003 Ozzfest tour, which included Voivod.\nBefore the band's set at the 2004 Download Festival, Ulrich was rushed to the hospital after having an anxiety seizure and was unable to perform. Hetfield searched for last-minute volunteers to replace Ulrich. Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo and Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison volunteered. Lombardo performed \"Battery\" and \"The Four Horsemen\", Ulrich's drum technician Flemming Larsen performed \"Fade to Black\", and Jordison performed the remainder of the set. Having toured for two years in support of \"St. Anger\" on the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003 and the Madly in Anger with the World Tour, with multi-platinum rock band Godsmack in support, Metallica took a break from performing and spent most of 2005 with friends and family. The band opened for the Rolling Stones at SBC Park in San Francisco on November 13 and 15, 2005.\n2006\u20132013: \"Death Magnetic\" and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.\nIn February 2006, Metallica announced on its official website that after 15 years, long-time producer Bob Rock would not be producing the band's next studio album. Instead, the band chose to work with producer Rick Rubin. Around the same time, a petition signed by 1,500 fans was posted online in an attempt to encourage the band to prohibit Rock from producing Metallica albums, saying he had too much influence on the band's sound and musical direction. Rock said the petition hurt his children's feelings; he said, \"sometimes, even with a great coach, a team keeps losing. You have to get new blood in there.\"\nIn December 2006, Metallica released a DVD titled \"The Videos 1989\u20132004\", which sold 28,000 copies in its first week and entered the \"Billboard\" Top Videos chart at number three. Metallica recorded a guitar-based interpretation of Ennio Morricone's \"The Ecstasy of Gold\" for a tribute album titled \"We All Love Ennio Morricone\", which was released in February 2007. The track received a Grammy nomination at the 50th Grammy Awards for the category \"Best Rock Instrumental Performance\". A recording of \"The Ecstasy of Gold\" has been played to introduce Metallica's performances since the 1980s.\nMetallica scheduled the release of the album \"Death Magnetic\" as September 12, 2008, and the band filmed a music video for the album's first single, \"The Day That Never Comes\". On September 2, 2008, a record store in France began selling copies of \"Death Magnetic\" nearly two weeks before its scheduled worldwide release date, which resulted in the album being made available on peer-to-peer clients. This prompted the band's UK distributor Vertigo Records to officially release the album on September 10, 2008. Rumors of Metallica or Warner Bros. taking legal action against the French retailer were unconfirmed, though drummer Lars Ulrich responded to the leak by saying, \"...We're ten days from release. I mean, from here, we're golden. If this thing leaks all over the world today or tomorrow, happy days. Happy days. Trust me\", and, \"By 2008 standards, that's a victory. If you'd told me six months ago that our record wouldn't leak until 10 days out, I would have signed up for that.\"\n\"Death Magnetic\" marked a return to the band's traditional thrash metal sound. The album debuted at number one in the U.S., selling 490,000 units; Metallica became the first band to have five consecutive studio albums debut at number one in the history of the \"Billboard\"\u00a0200.

However, during the band's set of \"Master of Puppets\" and \"Enter Sandman\", both Trujillo and Newsted were on stage. Ray Burton, father of the late Cliff Burton, accepted the honor on his behalf. Although he was not to be inducted with them, Metallica invited Dave Mustaine to take part in the induction ceremony.

In November 2010, during an interview with The Pulse of Radio, Ulrich said Metallica would return to writing in 2011. Ulrich said, \"There's a bunch of balls in the air for 2011, but I think the main one is we really want to get back to writing again. We haven't really written since, what, '06, '07, and we want to get back to kind of just being creative again. Right now we are going to just chill out and then probably start up again in, I'd say, March or April, and start probably putting the creative cap back on and start writing some songs.\"\nOn November 9, 2010, Metallica announced it would be headlining the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro on September 25, 2011.

There's no shortage of riffage in Metallica world right now.\" He added, \"The first album with Rick was also the first album for me, so in a lot of ways, you're kind of testing the water. Now that we're comfortable with Rick and his incredible engineer, Greg Fidelman, who worked with Slayer, actually, on this last record\u2014it's my hero\u2014it's a great team. And it's only gonna better; I really believe that.

Nowadays we like to do so many different things.\" Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion. \"Unless something radical happens it would be difficult for me to believe that it won't come out in 2016\".

There's no shortage of original ideas, that's the beauty of being in this band.\" He estimated that the album would be released sooner than the previous two did, saying: \"this time around I think we'll be able to jump on it a lot quicker and jump in the studio and start working.\" In an interview with Australian magazine \"Mixdown\" the following month, Hammett said that the band had tentative plans to enter the studio after the conclusion of its WorldWired Tour. He stated, \"We're in our third year since \"Hardwired\". Maybe we can get a bit more focus and go into the studio a bit sooner.\" After not contributing any writing to \"Hardwired... to Self-Destruct\", Hammett said regarding his ideas for the new album, \"I have a ton of material.

Trujillo told \"The Vinyl Guide\" in June that the band was \"excited about cultivating new ideas\" for its new album. \"We communicate every week, which is really great, so we have our connection intact. And what we've started doing is basically just really concentrating on our home studios and being creative from our homes and navigating through ideas and building on new ideas. And that's where we're at right now\". He also said that the band was working towards eventually entering a studio to record the album.\nOn August 10, 2020, Metallica played a show at Gundlach-Bundschu Winery in Sonoma, California, which was only attended by a few crew members, and it was recorded and played for drive-in movies across the U.S. and Canada on August 29.\nIn May 2021, the band announced that they would do one more \"#MetallicaMondays\" on May 24 to benefit their All Within My Hands Foundation.

The beauty of being with these guys, I kind of joke, James writes more riffs when he's tuning his guitar than most people do in a lifetime. That's the beauty of being in band with these guys and I'm eternally grateful. I'm dumbfounded by it.\" When asked about \"leftovers\" that could be used for the next Metallica album, Ulrich said, \"There's always a few riffs in the riff tank.\" In May 2024, Hetfield confirmed that he has been \"writing lots of music, playing guitar pretty much every day\".\nIn a March 2025 interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Hammett confirmed that he has been working on ideas for the next Metallica album: \"I have 767 new ones for the next album. It is such a nightmare going through this stuff, too. And I'm the one responsible for all of it and I can't do it...I don't foresee us starting the next album for at least another year because we're still finishing the tour.\"\nStyle and lyrical themes.\nMetallica played thrash and speed metal on their first four albums before changing their sound to a more traditional heavy metal style on 1991's \"Black Album\". \"Load\" and \"Reload\", released in 1996 and 1997 respectively, saw the band move towards hard rock. 2008's \"Death Magnetic\" saw them returning to a more thrash-influenced sound.\nMetallica was influenced by early heavy metal and hard rock bands and artists Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Ted Nugent, AC/DC, Rush, Aerosmith, and Judas Priest and by new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) bands Raven, Venom, Mot\u00f6rhead, Saxon, Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, and Iron Maiden as well as European bands Scorpions, Accept, and Mercyful Fate. Early punk rock bands the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, and the Misfits also influenced Metallica's style as did post-punk band Killing Joke and hardcore punk acts Discharge, GBH, and Suicidal Tendencies. \nLars Ulrich has cited Iron Maiden as probably the biggest influence on Metallica's career. The band's early releases contained fast tempos, harmonized leads, and nine-minute instrumental tracks. Steve Huey of AllMusic said \"Ride the Lightning\" featured \"extended, progressive epics; tight, concise groove-rockers\". He also said Metallica expanded its compositional technique and range of expression to take on a more aggressive approach in following releases, and lyrics dealt with personal and socially conscious issues. Religious and military leaders, rage, insanity, monsters, and drugs\u2014among other themes\u2014were explored on \"Master of Puppets\".\nIn 1991, Huey said Metallica with new producer Bob Rock simplified and streamlined its music for a more commercial approach to appeal to mainstream audiences. Robert Palmer of \"Rolling Stone\" said the band abandoned its aggressive, fast tempos to expand its music and expressive range. The change in direction proved commercially successful; \"Metallica\" was the band's first album to peak at number one on the \"Billboard\"\u00a0200. Metallica noticed changes to the rock scene created by the grunge movement of the early-1990s. In \"Load\"\u2014an album that has been described as having \"an almost alternative rock\" approach\u2014the band changed musical direction again and focused on non-metal influences. \nMetallica's new lyrical approach moved away from drugs and monsters, and focused on anger, loss, and retribution. Some fans and critics were not pleased with this change, which included haircuts, the cover art of \"Load\", a new main logo, and headlining the Lollapalooza festival of 1996. David Fricke of \"Rolling Stone\" described the move as \"goodbye to the moldy stricture and dead-end Puritanism of no-frills thrash\", and called \"Load\" the heaviest record of 1996. With the release of \"ReLoad\" in 1997, the band displayed blues and early hard rock influences, incorporating more rhythm and harmony in song structures.\n\"St. Anger\" marked another large change in the band's sound. Guitar solos were excluded from the album, leaving a \"raw and unpolished sound\". The band used drop C tuning; Ulrich's snare drum received particular criticism. \"New York Magazine\"'s Ethan Brown said it \"reverberates with a thwong\". The album's lyrics deal with Hetfield's drug rehabilitation and include references to the devil, anti-drug themes, claustrophobia, impending doom, and religious hypocrisy. At the advice of producer Rick Rubin, for its ninth studio album \"Death Magnetic\", the band returned to standard tuning and guitar solos. As a return to Metallica's thrash roots, \"Death Magnetic\" was a riff-oriented album featuring intense guitar solos and subtle lyrics about suicide and redemption.\nAll Within My Hands Foundation.\nIn February 2017, Metallica launched All Within My Hands Foundation, \"dedicated to creating sustainable communities by supporting workforce education, the fight against hunger, and other critical local services\". For example, the group works with various selected charities to organize volunteer projects at food banks. It also works with workforce training institutions on its Metallica Scholars grant program to help chosen students learn new trade skills. The Foundation has also donated and further raised funds for World Central Kitchen's Ukraine war relief efforts and granted $200,000 for relief efforts after the destructive 2023 Hawaii wildfires. The band has also performed fundraising concerts for the Foundation.\nLegacy and influence.\nMetallica has become one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time and is credited as one of the \"big four\" of thrash metal, along with Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth. The band has sold more than 125\u00a0million records worldwide, including an RIAA-certified 66\u00a0million and Nielsen SoundScan-reported 58\u00a0million in the US, making Metallica one of the most commercially successful bands of all time. The writers of \"The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll\" said Metallica gave heavy metal \"a much-needed charge\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Greg Prato of Allmusic said Metallica \"expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions\", and called the band \"easily the best, most influential heavy metal band of the '80s, responsible for bringing the music back to Earth\".\nJonathan Davis of Korn said he respects Metallica as his favorite band; he said, \"I love that they've done things their own way and they've persevered over the years and they're still relevant to this day. I think they're one of the greatest bands ever.\" Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin said Metallica has been the biggest influence on the band, stating, \"they really changed my life when I was 16 years old\u2014I'd never heard anything that heavy\". Chuck Billy of Testament has also cited Metallica as an influence on the band, as well as Hetfield as \"an inspiration with clever lyrics\"; he added, \"When I first started hearing Metallica it was something new to me the way his cadence of vocal styles sang to the music.\" Vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn of Machine Head said that when creating the band's 2007 album, \"The Blackening\", \"What we mean is an album that has the power, influence and epic grandeur of that album \"Master of Puppets\"\u2014and the staying power\u2014a timeless record like that\". Gojira guitarist Christian Andreu said it was while listening to \"Ride the Lightning\" that he started making music; saying \"we find on the album 'Fade to Black', 'For Whom the Bell Tolls', emblematic pieces\". Trivium guitarists Corey Beaulieu and Matt Heafy said that when they heard Metallica they wanted to start playing guitar. M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold said touring with Metallica was the band's career highlight, and said, \"Selling tons of records and playing huge shows will never compare to meeting your idols \"Metallica\"\". God Forbid guitarists Doc and Dallas Coyle were inspired by Metallica as they grew up, and the band's bassist John Outcalt admires Burton as a \"rocker\". Ill Ni\u00f1o drummer Dave Chavarri said he finds early Metallica releases are \"heavy, raw, rebellious. It said, 'fuck you'\", and Adema drummer Kris Kohls said the band is influenced by Metallica.\nOn April 4, 2009, Metallica were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame the second year they were eligible and first year they were nominated. Metallica's induction into the Hall included its current lineup, James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, Robert Trujillo, and Lars Ulrich, and former members Jason Newsted and Cliff Burton.\nMTV ranked Metallica the third \"Greatest Heavy Metal Band in History\".

Hammett's and Hetfield's voices were used in three episodes of the animated television series \"Metalocalypse\". \nIn 1996, Finnish cello metal band Apocalyptica released a tribute album titled \"Plays Metallica by Four Cellos\", which features eight Metallica songs played on cellos. A parody band named Beatallica plays music using a combination of the Beatles and Metallica songs. Beatallica faced legal troubles when Sony, which owns the Beatles' catalog, issued a cease and desist order, claiming \"substantial and irreparable injury\" and ordering the group to pay damages. Ulrich, a fan of Beatallica, asked Metallica's lawyer Peter Paterno to help settle the case.\nOn March 7, 1999, Metallica was inducted into the San Francisco Walk of Fame. The mayor of San Francisco, Willie Brown, proclaimed the day \"Official Metallica Day\". The band was awarded the MTV Icon award in 2003, and a concert paying tribute to the band with artists performing its songs was held. Performances included Sum 41 and a medley of \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\", \"Enter Sandman\", and \"Master of Puppets\". Staind covered \"Nothing Else Matters\", Avril Lavigne played \"Fuel\", hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg performed \"Sad but True\", Korn played \"One\", and Limp Bizkit performed \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\".\nThe \"Guitar Hero\" video game series included several of Metallica's songs. \"One\" was used in \"Guitar Hero III\". The album \"Death Magnetic\" was later released as purchasable, downloadable content for the game. \"Trapped Under Ice\" was featured in the sequel, \"Guitar Hero World Tour\". In 2009, Metallica collaborated with the game's developers to make \"\", which included a number of Metallica's songs. Harmonix' video game series \"Rock Band\" included \"Enter Sandman\" and \"Battery\"; \"Ride the Lightning\", \"Blackened\", and \"...And Justice for All\" were released as downloadable tracks. In 2013, due to expiring content licenses, \"Ride the Lightning\", \"Blackened\", and \"...And Justice for All\" are no longer available for download. \"Fortnite Festival\", a 2023 rhythm game developed by Harmonix as part of \"Fortnite\", held a Metallica-centric season from June to August 2024 which included \"One\", \"Lux \u00c6terna\", and \"Master of Puppets\". Metallica also performed virtually in \"Fortnite\" in \"Metallica: Fuel. Fire. Fury.\", with cosmetics based on Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett and Trujillo being added to the game.\nIn October 2020, Miley Cyrus announced that she was planning on recording a Metallica covers album and on January 7, 2021, she announced that she has recorded a cover version of \"Nothing Else Matters\" that would feature Elton John on piano, drummer Chad Smith from Red Hot Chili Peppers and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. This version was produced by Andrew Watt, and was released as a promotional single for the tribute album \"The Metallica Blacklist.\"\nIn late 2024, \"Sky News\" ran an article on Gaza's first rock group, Osprey V. The group's guitarist, Raji El-Jaru said that the group was influenced by Metallica and Linkin Park.\nFeuds.\nDave Mustaine/Megadeth.\nFormer lead guitarist and Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine has been involved in a historic feud with Metallica. During his time as a founding member during the first two years of the band, Mustaine's tenure was marred by his alcoholism and even a physical altercation with James Hetfield. Mustaine continued to make numerous inflammatory statements against his former band in the press due to buried tension primarily stemming from his firing in 1983 among other issues such as existing songwriting credits across Metallica's first three albums. \nBy the late 1980s, it was believed that the feud had largely subsided; later confirmed after Megadeth were hired to open for Metallica on numerous European dates in 1993. Despite this, Mustaine expressed his anger at Metallica during his appearance in the band's documentary \"\", in a scene he later disapproved of as he felt he was mischaracterized, and that it did not represent the full extent of what happened during the meeting. \nBy 2010, the two bands found themselves on friendlier terms when they took part in the lauded \"Big 4 Tour\", alongside Slayer and Anthrax. That same year, Mustaine took part in Metallica's exclusive 30th anniversary show in San Francisco which invited other former members: Ron McGovney, Lloyd Grant, and Jason Newsted. In 2022, Tensions reignited between the band and Mustaine following discussions over a remastered release of the \"No Life 'Til Leather\" demo in which Hetfield and Ulrich considered involving Mustaine. However, the relationship quickly began to deteriorate once again after a dispute with Ulrich insisting on crediting himself on each of the tracks, much to Mustaine's anger, resulting in the cancellation of the project entirely and reigniting hostility with his former bandmates.\nM\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce.\nOften clashing during the early 1980s, both bands were fighting for dominance in the Los Angeles rock scene during Metallica's early years prior to their relocation to the Bay Area. Both James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich expressed their hatred of the hair metal scene in Los Angeles during the time and frequently attacked multiple up-and-coming local bands in multiple interviews, including M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. Ulrich and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's bassist Nikki Sixx had allegedly been involved in a spat prior to a show at the Troubadour in Hollywood in 1982. Though despite their public disdain for glam metal, Metallica were impressed by the production and commercial success of \"Dr. Feelgood\" in 1989, later hiring the album's producer Bob Rock to produce their self-titled fifth album in 1991.\nSeveral years later, Sixx and Ulrich reignited the feud after Ulrich accused M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce of performing to a backing track at the 1997 American Music Awards. Sixx responded via an online forum in which he insulted numerous band members and also attacked Metallica's then-recent album \"Load\". Despite this, Sixx praised Metallica's then-latest album \"St. Anger\" during a 2003 interview, contrary to the negative attention it received upon release. \nIn 2006, both M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce drummer Tommy Lee, and former bassist Jason Newsted took part in a reality show titled \"\" as they would both participate in creating a supergroup while the show's premise revolved around finding a frontman via contest. During a 2011 meet-and-greet in Mexico City, Hetfield was approached by a fan attacking M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce due to their public image and frequent appearances in tabloids. Hetfield refused to directly respond to the fan's comments towards M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce but laughed in his insults toward the band. \nIn 2015, drummer Lee reignited the feud when he tweeted a picture of Ulrich with the words \"Straight Outta Tempo\" superimposed over his face. Following the post by Lee, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce singer Vince Neil had stated online that he was unaware of the feud with Metallica; however, during a later interview with an Oregon radio show, Neil was again asked about the band's current relationship with Metallica and hung up on the show's host. Things were alleged to have calmed down by 2017, when Hetfield appeared on Sixx's radio show \"Sixx Sense\". During an interview in 2021, Sixx applauded Metallica's longevity and praised several of their releases during an interview.\nJason Newsted.\nFollowing his hiring in 1986, former bassist Jason Newsted had regularly experienced incidents of hazing and a perceived lack of acceptance from his bandmates despite his strong efforts in a majority of the band's live performances. Many fans and outlets cite the band's fourth album's unusual mixing to drown the bass tracks as a possible effort by Hetfield and Ulrich to minimize Newsted's involvement. This sentiment was further exacerbated by the fact that Newsted was only given songwriting credits on three songs during his 14-year span in the band which also saw him perform on four studio albums. \nTensions between Hetfield and Newsted reached a breaking point in 2000 after Hetfield repeatedly blocked Newsted's request to venture into his side project Echobrain. Discussions broke down and Newsted abruptly left the band in January 2001 prior to the recording of \"St. Anger\". Despite Newsted's animosity surrounding his decision, he was later inducted into the hall of fame as a member of the band in 2009 and also appeared at the band's 30th anniversary show in San Francisco in 2011. In August 2021, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the release of the band's self-titled album, Newsted was given a box set of the reissue to open for an unboxing video, which was uploaded to the band's YouTube channel.\nBand members.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nAwards and nominations.\nGrammy Awards\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Mural techniques include fresco, mosaic, graffiti and marouflage.\nWord mural in art.\nThe word \"mural\" is a Spanish adjective that is used to refer to what is attached to a wall. The term \"mural\" later became a noun. In art, the word began to be used at the beginning of the 20th century. \nIn 1906, Dr. Atl issued a manifesto calling for the development of a monumental public art movement in Mexico; he named it in Spanish \"pintura mural\" (English: \"wall painting\"). \nIn ancient Roman times, a mural crown was given to the fighter who was first to scale the wall of a besieged town. \"Mural\" comes from the Latin \"muralis\", meaning \"wall painting\". This word is related to \"murus\", meaning \"wall\".\nHistory.\nAntique art.\nMurals of sorts date to Upper Paleolithic times such as the cave paintings in the Lubang Jeriji Sal\u00e9h cave in Borneo (40,000\u201352,000 BP), Chauvet Cave in Ard\u00e8che department of southern France (around 32,000 BP). Many ancient murals have been found within ancient Egyptian tombs (around 3150\u00a0BC), the Minoan palaces (Middle period III of the Neopalatial period, 1700\u20131600 BC), the Oxtotitl\u00e1n cave and Juxtlahuaca in Mexico (around 1200\u2013900 BC) and in Pompeii (around 100 BC \u2013 AD 79).\nDuring the Middle Ages murals were usually executed on dry plaster (secco). The huge collection of Kerala mural painting dating from the 14th century are examples of fresco secco. In Italy, c.\u20091300, the technique of painting of frescos on wet plaster was reintroduced and led to a significant increase in the quality of mural painting.\nModern art.\nThe term mural became better known with the Mexican muralism art movement (Diego Rivera, David Siqueiros and Jos\u00e9 Orozco). \nThe first mural painted in the 20th century, was \"El \u00e1rbol de la vida\", by Roberto Montenegro.\nThere are many different styles and techniques. The best-known is probably \"fresco\", which uses pigments dispersed in water with a damp lime wash, rapid use of the resulting mixture over a large surface, and often in parts (but with a sense of the whole). The colors lighten as they dry. The \"marouflage\" method has also been used for millennia.\nMurals today are painted in a variety of ways, using oil or water-based media. The styles can vary from abstract to \"trompe-l'\u0153il\" (a French term for \"fool\" or \"trick the eye\"). Initiated by the works of mural artists like Graham Rust or Rainer Maria Latzke in the 1980s, trompe-l'\u0153il painting has experienced a renaissance in private and public buildings in Europe.\nToday, the beauty of a wall mural has become much more widely available with a technique whereby a painting or photographic image is transferred to poster paper or canvas which is then pasted to a wall surface \"(see wallpaper, Frescography)\" to give the effect of either a hand-painted mural or realistic scene.\nA special type of mural painting is L\u00fcftlmalerei, still practised today in the villages of the Alpine valleys. Well-known examples of such fa\u00e7ade designs from the 18th and 19th centuries can be found in Mittenwald, Garmisch, Unter- and Oberammergau.\nTechnique.\nIn the history of murals, several methods have been used:\n\"A fresco\" painting, from the Italian word \"affresco\" which derives from the adjective \"fresco\" (\"fresh\"), describes a method in which the paint is applied on plaster on walls or ceilings. \nThe \"buon fresco\" technique consists of painting in pigment mixed with water on a thin layer of wet, fresh, lime mortar or plaster. The pigment is then absorbed by the wet plaster; after a number of hours, the plaster dries and reacts with the air: it is this chemical reaction which fixes the pigment particles in the plaster. After this, the painting stays for a long time up to centuries in fresh and brilliant colors.\n\"Fresco-secco\" painting is done on dry plaster (\"secco\" is \"dry\" in Italian). The pigments thus require a binding medium, such as egg (tempera), glue or oil to attach the pigment to the wall.\n\"Mezzo-fresco\" is painted on nearly-dry plaster, and was defined by the sixteenth-century author Ignazio Pozzo as \"firm enough not to take a thumb-print\" so that the pigment only penetrates slightly into the plaster. By the end of the sixteenth century, this had largely displaced the \"buon fresco\" method, and was used by painters such as Gianbattista Tiepolo or Michelangelo. This technique had, in reduced form, the advantages of \"a secco\" work.\nMaterial.\nIn Greco-Roman times, mostly encaustic colors applied in a cold state were used.\nTempera painting is one of the oldest known methods in mural painting. In tempera, the pigments are bound in an albuminous medium such as egg yolk or egg white diluted in water.\nIn 16th-century Europe, oil painting on canvas arose as an easier method for mural painting. The advantage was that the artwork could be completed in the artist's studio and later transported to its destination and there attached to the wall or ceiling. Oil paint may be a less satisfactory medium for murals because of its lack of brilliance in colour. Also, the pigments are yellowed by the binder or are more easily affected by atmospheric conditions. \nDifferent muralists tend to become experts in their preferred medium and application, whether that be oil paints, emulsion or acrylic paints applied by brush, roller or airbrush/aerosols. Clients will often ask for a particular style and the artist may adjust to the appropriate technique.\nA consultation usually leads to detailed design and layout of the proposed mural with a price quote that the client approves before the muralist starts on the work. The area to be painted can be gridded to match the design allowing the image to be scaled accurately step by step. In some cases, the design is projected straight onto the wall and traced with pencil before painting begins. Some muralists will paint directly without any prior sketching, preferring the spontaneous technique.\nOnce completed the mural can be given coats of varnish or protective acrylic glaze to protect the work from UV rays and surface damage.\nIn modern, quick form of muralling, young enthusiasts also use POP clay mixed with glue or bond to give desired models on canvas board. The canvas is later set aside to let the clay dry. Once dried, the canvas and the shape can be painted with your choice of colors and later coated with varnish.\nAs an alternative to a hand-painted or airbrushed mural, digitally printed murals can also be applied to surfaces. Already existing murals can be photographed and then be reproduced in near-to-original quality.\nThe disadvantages of pre-fabricated murals and decals are that they are often mass-produced and lack the allure and exclusivity of original artwork. They are often not fitted to the individual wall sizes of the client and their personal ideas or wishes cannot be added to the mural as it progresses. The Frescography technique, a digital manufacturing method (CAM) invented by Rainer Maria Latzke addresses some of the personalisation and size restrictions.\nDigital techniques are commonly used in advertisements. A \"wallscape\" is a large advertisement on or attached to the outside wall of a building. Wallscapes can be painted directly on the wall as a mural, or printed on vinyl and securely attached to the wall in the manner of a billboard. Although not strictly classed as murals, large scale printed media are often referred to as such. Advertising murals were traditionally painted onto buildings and shops by sign-writers, later as large scale poster billboards.\nSignificance.\nMurals are important as they bring art into the public sphere. Due to the size, cost, and work involved in creating a mural, muralists must often be commissioned by a sponsor. Often it is the local government or a business, but many murals have been paid for with grants of patronage. For artists, their work gets a wide audience who otherwise might not set foot in an art gallery. A city benefits by the beauty of a work of art.\nMurals can be a relatively effective tool of social emancipation or achieving a political goal. Murals have sometimes been created against the law, or have been commissioned by local bars and coffee shops. Often, the visual effects are an enticement to attract public attention to social issues. State-sponsored public art expressions, particularly murals, are often used by totalitarian regimes as a tool of propaganda. However, despite the propagandist character of that works, some of them still have an artistic value.\nMurals can have a dramatic impact whether consciously or subconsciously on the attitudes of passers-by, when they are added to areas where people live and work. It can also be argued that the presence of large, public murals can add aesthetic improvement to the daily lives of residents or that of employees at a corporate venue. Large-format hand-painted murals were the norm for advertisements in cities across America, before the introduction of vinyl and digital posters. It was an expensive form of advertising with strict signage laws but gained attention and improved local aesthetics.\nOther world-famous murals can be found in Mexico, New York City, Philadelphia, Belfast, Derry, Los Angeles, Nicaragua, Cuba, the Philippines, and in India. They have functioned as an important means of communication for members of socially, ethnically and racially divided communities in times of conflict. They also proved to be an effective tool in establishing a dialogue and hence solving the cleavage in the long run.\nThe Indian state Kerala has exclusive murals. These Kerala mural painting are on walls of Hindu temples. They can be dated from 9th century AD.\nThe San Bartolo murals of the Maya civilization in Guatemala, are the oldest example of this art in Mesoamerica and are dated at 300 BC.\nMany rural towns have begun using murals to create tourist attractions in order to boost economic income. Colquitt, Georgia was chosen to host the 2010 Global Mural Conference. The town had more than twelve murals completed, and hosted the Conference along with Dothan, Alabama, and Blakely, Georgia.\nPolitics.\nThe Mexican mural movement in the 1930s brought new prominence to murals as a social and political tool. Diego Rivera, Jos\u00e9 Orozco and David Siqueiros were the most famous artists of the movement. Between 1932 and 1940, Rivera also painted murals in San Francisco, Detroit, and New York City. In 1933, he completed a famous series of twenty-seven fresco panels entitled \"Detroit Industry\" on the walls of an inner court at the Detroit Institute of Arts. During the McCarthyism of the 1950s, a was placed in the courtyard defending the artistic merit of the murals while attacking his politics as \"detestable\".\nIn 1948, the Colombian government hosted the IX Pan-American Conference to establish the Marshall plan for the Americas. The director of the OEA and the Colombian government commissioned master Santiago Martinez Delgado, to paint a mural in the Colombian congress building to commemorate the event. Martinez decided to make it about the C\u00facuta Congress, and painted Bol\u00edvar in front of Santander, making liberals upset; so, due to the murder of Jorge Elieser Gaitan the mobs of el bogotazo tried to burn the capitol, but the Colombian Army stopped them. Years later, in the 1980s, with liberals in charge of the Congress, they passed a resolution to turn the whole chamber in the Elliptic Room 90 degrees to put the main mural on the side and commissioned Alejandro Obregon to paint a non-partisan mural in the surrealist style.\nIn Chile, the Romana Parra Brigade painted political murals in support of workers rights and Communism.\nNorthern Ireland contains some of the most famous political murals in the world. Almost 2,000 murals have been documented in Northern Ireland since the 1970s. In recent times, many murals are non-sectarian, concerning political and social issues such as racism and environmentalism, and many are completely apolitical, depicting children at play and scenes from everyday life. (See Northern Irish murals.)\nA not political, but social related mural covers a wall in an old building, once a prison, at the top of a cliff in Bardiyah, in Libya. It was painted and signed by the artist in April 1942, weeks before his death on the first day of the First Battle of El Alamein. Known as the Bardia Mural, it was created by English artist, private John Frederick Brill.\nIn 1961 East Germany began to erect a wall between East and West Berlin, which became famous as the Berlin Wall. While on the East Berlin side painting was not allowed, artists painted on the Western side of the Wall from the 80s until the fall of the Wall in 1989.\nMany unknown and known artists such as Thierry Noir and Keith Haring painted on the Wall, the \"World's longest canvas\". The sometimes detailed artwork were often painted over within hours or days. On the Western side the Wall was not protected, so everybody could paint on the Wall. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the Eastern side of the Wall became also a popular \"canvas\" for many mural and graffiti artists.\nOrgosolo, in Sardinia, is a most important center of murals politics.\nIt is also common for mural graffiti to be used as a memoir. In the 2001 book \"Somebody Told Me\", Rick Bragg writes about a series of communities, mainly located in New York, that have walls dedicated to the people who died. These memorials, both written word and mural style, provide the deceased to be present in the communities in which they lived. Bragg states that the \"murals have woven themselves in the fabric of the neighborhoods, and the city\". These memorials remind people of the deaths caused by inner city violence.\nContemporary interior design.\nTraditional.\nMany people like to express their individuality by commissioning an artist to paint a mural in their home. This is not an activity exclusively for owners of large houses. A mural artist is only limited by the fee and therefore the time spent on the painting; dictating the level of detail; a simple mural can be added to the smallest of walls.\nPrivate commissions can be for dining rooms, bathrooms, living rooms or, as is often the case- children's bedrooms. A child's room can be transformed into the 'fantasy world' of a forest or racing track, encouraging imaginative play and an awareness of art.\nThe current trend for feature walls has increased commissions for muralists in the UK. A large hand-painted mural can be designed on a specific theme, incorporate personal images and elements and may be altered during the course of painting it. The personal interaction between client and muralist is often a unique experience for an individual not usually involved in the arts.\nIn the 1980s, illusionary wall painting experienced a renaissance in private homes. The reason for this revival in interior design could, in some cases be attributed to the reduction in living space for the individual. Faux architectural features, as well as natural scenery and views, can have the effect of 'opening out' the walls. Densely built-up areas of housing may also contribute to people's feelings of being cut off from nature in its free form. A mural commission of this sort may be an attempt by some people to re-establish a balance with nature.\nCommissions of murals in schools, hospitals, and retirement homes can achieve a pleasing and welcoming atmosphere in these caring institutions. Murals in other public buildings, such as public houses are also common.\nGraffiti-style.\nRecently, graffiti and street art have played a key role in contemporary wall painting. Such graffiti/street artists as Keith Haring, Shepard Fairey, Above, Mint&amp;Serf, Futura 2000, Os Gemeos, and Faile among others have successfully transcended their street art aesthetic beyond the walls of urban landscape and onto walls of private and corporate clients. As graffiti/street art became more mainstream in the late 1990s, youth-oriented brands such as Nike and Red Bull, with Wieden Kennedy, have turned to graffiti/street artists to decorate walls of their respective offices. This trend continued through 2000's with graffiti/street art gaining more recognition from art institutions worldwide.\nEthnic.\nMany homeowners choose to display the traditional art and culture of their society or events from their history in their homes. Ethnic murals have become an important form of interior decoration. Warli painting murals are becoming a preferred mode of wall decor in India. Warli painting is an ancient Indian art form in which the tribal people used to depict different phases of their life on the walls of their mud houses.\nTile.\nTile murals are murals made out of stone, ceramic, porcelain, glass and or metal tiles that are installed within, or added onto the surface of an existing wall. They are also inlaid into floors. Mural tiles are painted, glazed, sublimation printed (as described below) or more traditionally cut out of stone, ceramic, mosaic glass(opaque) and stained glass. Some artists use pottery and plates broken into pieces. Unlike the traditional painted murals described above, tile murals are always made by fitting pieces of the selected materials together to create the design or image. \nMosaic murals are made by combining small 1/4\" to 2\" size pieces of colorful stone, ceramic, or glass tiles which are then laid out to create a picture. Modern day technology has allowed commercial mosaic mural makers to use computer programs to separate photographs into colors that are automatically cut and glued onto sheets of mesh creating precise murals fast and in large quantities.\nThe azulejo (, ) refers to a typical form of Portuguese or Spanish painted, tin-glazed, ceramic tilework. They have become a typical aspect of Portuguese culture, manifesting without interruption during five centuries, the consecutive trends in art.\nAzulejos can be found inside and outside churches, palaces, ordinary houses and even railway stations or subway stations.\nThey were not only used as an ornamental art form, but also had a specific functional capacity like temperature control in homes. Many \"azulejos\" chronicle major historical and cultural aspects of Portuguese history.\nCustom-printed tile murals can be produced using digital images for kitchen splashbacks, wall displays, and flooring. Digital photos and artwork can be resized and printed to accommodate the desired size for the area to be decorated. Custom tile printing uses a variety of techniques including dye sublimation and ceramic-type laser toners. The latter technique can yield fade-resistant custom tiles which are suitable for long term exterior exposure.\nNotable muralists.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "18819", "revid": "876844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18819", "title": "Microeconomics", "text": "Behavior of individuals and firms\nMicroeconomics is a branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources and the interactions among these individuals and firms. Microeconomics focuses on the study of individual markets, sectors, or industries as opposed to the economy as a whole, which is studied in macroeconomics.\nOne goal of microeconomics is to analyze the market mechanisms that establish relative prices among goods and services and allocate limited resources among alternative uses. Microeconomics shows conditions under which free markets lead to desirable allocations. It also analyzes market failure, where markets fail to produce efficient results.\nWhile microeconomics focuses on firms and individuals, macroeconomics focuses on the total of economic activity, dealing with the issues of growth, inflation, and unemployment\u2014and with national policies relating to these issues. Microeconomics also deals with the effects of economic policies (such as changing taxation levels) on microeconomic behavior and thus on the aforementioned aspects of the economy. Particularly in the wake of the Lucas critique, much of modern macroeconomic theories has been built upon microfoundations\u2014i.e., based upon basic assumptions about micro-level behavior.\nAssumptions and definitions.\nMicroeconomic study historically has been performed according to general equilibrium theory, developed by L\u00e9on Walras in \"Elements of Pure Economics\" (1874) and partial equilibrium theory, introduced by Alfred Marshall in \"Principles of Economics\" (1890).\nMicroeconomic theory typically begins with the study of a single rational and utility maximizing individual. To economists, rationality means an individual possesses stable preferences that are both complete and transitive. \nThe technical assumption that preference relations are continuous is needed to ensure the existence of a utility function. Although microeconomic theory can continue without this assumption, it would make comparative statics impossible since there is no guarantee that the resulting utility function would be differentiable.\nMicroeconomic theory progresses by defining a competitive budget set which is a subset of the consumption set. It is at this point that economists make the technical assumption that preferences are locally non-satiated. Without the assumption of LNS (local non-satiation) there is no 100% guarantee but there would be a rational rise in individual utility. With the necessary tools and assumptions in place the utility maximization problem (UMP) is developed.\nThe utility maximization problem is the heart of consumer theory. The utility maximization problem attempts to explain the action axiom by imposing rationality axioms on consumer preferences and then mathematically modeling and analyzing the consequences. The utility maximization problem serves not only as the mathematical foundation of consumer theory but as a metaphysical explanation of it as well. That is, the utility maximization problem is used by economists to not only explain \"what\" or \"how\" individuals make choices but \"why\" individuals make choices as well.\nThe utility maximization problem is a constrained optimization problem in which an individual seeks to maximize utility subject to a budget constraint. Economists use the extreme value theorem to guarantee that a solution to the utility maximization problem exists. That is, since the budget constraint is both bounded and closed, a solution to the utility maximization problem exists. Economists call the solution to the utility maximization problem a Walrasian demand function or correspondence.\nThe utility maximization problem has so far been developed by taking consumer tastes (i.e. consumer utility) as primitive. However, an alternative way to develop microeconomic theory is by taking consumer choice as primitive. This model of microeconomic theory is referred to as revealed preference theory.\nThe theory of supply and demand usually assumes that markets are perfectly competitive. This implies that there are many buyers and sellers in the market and none of them have the capacity to significantly influence prices of goods and services. In many real-life transactions, the assumption fails because some individual buyers or sellers have the ability to influence prices. Quite often, a sophisticated analysis is required to understand the demand-supply equation of a good model. However, the theory works well in situations meeting these assumptions.\nMainstream economics does not assume \"a priori\" that markets are preferable to other forms of social organization. In fact, much analysis is devoted to cases where market failures lead to resource allocation that is suboptimal and creates deadweight loss. A classic example of suboptimal resource allocation is that of a public good. In such cases, economists may attempt to find policies that avoid waste, either directly by government control, indirectly by regulation that induces market participants to act in a manner consistent with optimal welfare, or by creating \"missing markets\" to enable efficient trading where none had previously existed.\nThis is studied in the field of collective action and public choice theory. \"Optimal welfare\" usually takes on a Paretian norm, which is a mathematical application of the Kaldor\u2013Hicks method. This can diverge from the Utilitarian goal of maximizing utility because it does not consider the distribution of goods between people. Market failure in positive economics (microeconomics) is limited in implications without mixing the belief of the economist and their theory.\nThe demand for various commodities by individuals is generally thought of as the outcome of a utility-maximizing process, with each individual trying to maximize their own utility under a budget constraint and a given consumption set.\nAllocation of scarce resources.\nIndividuals and firms need to allocate limited resources to ensure all agents in the economy are well off. Firms decide which goods and services to produce considering low costs involving labour, materials and capital as well as potential profit margins. Consumers choose the good and services they want that will maximize their happiness taking into account their limited wealth.\nThe government can make these allocation decisions or they can be independently made by the consumers and firms. For example, in the former Soviet Union, the government played a part in informing car manufacturers which cars to produce and which consumers will gain access to a car.\nHistory.\nEconomists commonly consider themselves microeconomists or macroeconomists. The difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics likely was introduced in 1933 by the Norwegian economist Ragnar Frisch, the co-recipient of the first Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1969. However, Frisch did not actually use the word \"microeconomics\", instead drawing distinctions between \"micro-dynamic\" and \"macro-dynamic\" analysis in a way similar to how the words \"microeconomics\" and \"macroeconomics\" are used today. The first known use of the term \"microeconomics\" in a published article was from Pieter de Wolff in 1941, who broadened the term \"micro-dynamics\" into \"microeconomics\".\nMicroeconomic theory.\nConsumer demand theory.\nConsumer demand theory relates preferences for the consumption of both goods and services to the consumption expenditures; ultimately, this relationship between preferences and consumption expenditures is used to relate preferences to consumer demand curves. The link between personal preferences, consumption and the demand curve is one of the most closely studied relations in economics. It is a way of analyzing how consumers may achieve equilibrium between preferences and expenditures by maximizing utility subject to consumer budget constraints.\nProduction theory.\nProduction theory is the study of production, or the economic process of converting inputs into outputs. Production uses resources to create a good or service that is suitable for use, gift-giving in a gift economy, or exchange in a market economy. This can include manufacturing, storing, shipping, and packaging. Some economists define production broadly as all economic activity other than consumption. They see every commercial activity other than the final purchase as some form of production.\nCost-of-production theory of value.\nThe cost-of-production theory of value states that the price of an object or condition is determined by the sum of the cost of the resources that went into making it. The cost can comprise any of the factors of production (including labor, capital, or land) and taxation. Technology can be viewed either as a form of fixed capital (e.g. an industrial plant) or circulating capital (e.g. intermediate goods).\nIn the mathematical model for the cost of production, the short-run total cost is equal to fixed cost plus total variable cost. The fixed cost refers to the cost that is incurred regardless of how much the firm produces. The variable cost is a function of the quantity of an object being produced. The cost function can be used to characterize production through the duality theory in economics, developed mainly by Ronald Shephard (1953, 1970) and other scholars (Sickles &amp; Zelenyuk, 2019, ch. 2).\nFixed and variable costs.\nOver a short time period (few months), most costs are fixed costs as the firm will have to pay for salaries, contracted shipment and materials used to produce various goods. Over a longer time period (2-3 years), costs can become variable. Firms can decide to reduce output, purchase fewer materials and even sell some machinery. Over 10 years, most costs become variable as workers can be laid off or new machinery can be bought to replace the old machinery\nSunk costs \u2013 This is a fixed cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. An example of this can be in R&amp;D development like in the pharmaceutical industry. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent to achieve new drug breakthroughs but this is challenging as its increasingly harder to find new breakthroughs and meet tighter regulation standards. Thus many projects are written off leading to losses of millions of dollars\nOpportunity cost.\nOpportunity cost is closely related to the idea of time constraints. One can do only one thing at a time, which means that, inevitably, one is always giving up other things. The opportunity cost of any activity is the value of the next-best alternative thing one may have done instead. Opportunity cost depends only on the value of the next-best alternative. It does not matter whether one has five alternatives or 5,000.\nOpportunity costs can tell when \"not\" to do something as well as when to do something. For example, one may like waffles, but like chocolate even more. If someone offers only waffles, one would take it. But if offered waffles or chocolate, one would take the chocolate. The opportunity cost of eating waffles is sacrificing the chance to eat chocolate. Because the cost of not eating the chocolate is higher than the benefits of eating the waffles, it makes no sense to choose waffles. Of course, if one chooses chocolate, they are still faced with the opportunity cost of giving up having waffles. But one is willing to do that because the waffle's opportunity cost is lower than the benefits of the chocolate. Opportunity costs are unavoidable constraints on behavior because one has to decide what's best and give up the next-best alternative.\nPrice theory.\nMicroeconomics is also known as price theory to highlight the significance of prices in relation to buyer and sellers as these agents determine prices due to their individual actions. Price theory is a field of economics that uses the supply and demand framework to explain and predict human behavior. It is associated with the Chicago School of Economics. Price theory studies competitive equilibrium in markets to yield testable hypotheses that can be rejected.\nPrice theory is not the same as microeconomics. Strategic behavior, such as the interactions among sellers in a market where they are few, is a significant part of microeconomics but is not emphasized in price theory. Price theorists focus on competition believing it to be a reasonable description of most markets that leaves room to study additional aspects of tastes and technology. As a result, price theory tends to use less game theory than microeconomics does.\nPrice theory focuses on how agents respond to prices, but its framework can be applied to a wide variety of socioeconomic issues that might not seem to involve prices at first glance. Price theorists have influenced several other fields including developing public choice theory and law and economics. Price theory has been applied to issues previously thought of as outside the purview of economics such as criminal justice, marriage, and addiction.\nMicroeconomic models.\nSupply and demand.\nSupply and demand is an economic model of price determination in a perfectly competitive market. It concludes that in a perfectly competitive market with no externalities, per unit taxes, or price controls, the unit price for a particular good is the price at which the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers. This price results in a stable economic equilibrium.\nPrices and quantities have been described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a market economy. The theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed. In microeconomics, it applies to price and output determination for a market with perfect competition, which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting power.\nFor a given market of a commodity, demand is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of the good. Demand is often represented by a table or a graph showing price and quantity demanded (as in the figure). Demand theory describes individual consumers as rationally choosing the most preferred quantity of each good, given income, prices, tastes, etc. A term for this is \"constrained utility maximization\" (with income and wealth as the constraints on demand). Here, utility refers to the hypothesized relation of each individual consumer for ranking different commodity bundles as more or less preferred.\nThe law of demand states that, in general, price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related. That is, the higher the price of a product, the less of it people would be prepared to buy (other things unchanged). As the price of a commodity falls, consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods (the substitution effect). In addition, purchasing power from the price decline increases ability to buy (the income effect). Other factors can change demand ; for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a normal good outward relative to the origin, as in the figure. All determinants are predominantly taken as constant factors of demand and supply.\n\"Supply\" is the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price. It may be represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied. Producers, for example business firms, are hypothesized to be \"profit maximizers\", meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit. Supply is typically represented as a function relating price and quantity, if other factors are unchanged.\nThat is, the higher the price at which the good can be sold, the more of it producers will supply, as in the figure. The higher price makes it profitable to increase production. Just as on the demand side, the position of the supply can shift, say from a change in the price of a productive input or a technical improvement. The \"Law of Supply\" states that, in general, a rise in price leads to an expansion in supply and a fall in price leads to a contraction in supply. Here as well, the determinants of supply, such as price of substitutes, cost of production, technology applied and various factors of inputs of production are all taken to be constant for a specific time period of evaluation of supply.\nMarket equilibrium occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, the intersection of the supply and demand curves in the figure above. At a price below equilibrium, there is a shortage of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This is posited to bid the price up. At a price above equilibrium, there is a surplus of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This pushes the price down. The model of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves, price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded. Similarly, demand-and-supply theory predicts a new price-quantity combination from a shift in demand (as to the figure), or in supply.\nFor a given quantity of a consumer good, the point on the demand curve indicates the value, or marginal utility, to consumers for that unit. It measures what the consumer would be prepared to pay for that unit. The corresponding point on the supply curve measures marginal cost, the increase in total cost to the supplier for the corresponding unit of the good. The price in equilibrium is determined by supply and demand. In a perfectly competitive market, supply and demand equate marginal cost and marginal utility at equilibrium.\nOn the supply side of the market, some factors of production are described as (relatively) \"variable\" in the short run, which affects the cost of changing output levels. Their usage rates can be changed easily, such as electrical power, raw-material inputs, and over-time and temp work. Other inputs are relatively \"fixed\", such as plant and equipment and key personnel. In the long run, all inputs may be adjusted by management. These distinctions translate to differences in the elasticity (responsiveness) of the supply curve in the short and long runs and corresponding differences in the price-quantity change from a shift on the supply or demand side of the market.\nMarginalist theory, such as above, describes the consumers as attempting to reach most-preferred positions, subject to income and wealth constraints while producers attempt to maximize profits subject to their own constraints, including demand for goods produced, technology, and the price of inputs. For the consumer, that point comes where marginal utility of a good, net of price, reaches zero, leaving no net gain from further consumption increases. Analogously, the producer compares marginal revenue (identical to price for the perfect competitor) against the marginal cost of a good, with \"marginal profit\" the difference. At the point where marginal profit reaches zero, further increases in production of the good stop. For movement to market equilibrium and for changes in equilibrium, price and quantity also change \"at the margin\": more-or-less of something, rather than necessarily all-or-nothing.\nOther applications of demand and supply include the distribution of income among the factors of production, including labor and capital, through factor markets. In a competitive labor market for example the quantity of labor employed and the price of labor (the wage rate) depends on the demand for labor (from employers for production) and supply of labor (from potential workers). Labor economics examines the interaction of workers and employers through such markets to explain patterns and changes of wages and other labor income, labor mobility, and (un)employment, productivity through human capital, and related public-policy issues.\nDemand-and-supply analysis is used to explain the behavior of perfectly competitive markets, but as a standard of comparison it can be extended to any type of market. It can also be generalized to explain variables across the economy, for example, total output (estimated as real GDP) and the general price level, as studied in macroeconomics. Tracing the qualitative and quantitative effects of variables that change supply and demand, whether in the short or long run, is a standard exercise in applied economics. Economic theory may also specify conditions such that supply and demand through the market is an efficient mechanism for allocating resources.\nMarket structure.\nMarket structure refers to features of a market, including the number of firms in the market, the distribution of market shares between them, product uniformity across firms, how easy it is for firms to enter and exit the market, and forms of competition in the market. A market structure can have several types of interacting market systems. \nDifferent forms of markets are a feature of capitalism and market socialism, with advocates of state socialism often criticizing markets and aiming to substitute or replace markets with varying degrees of government-directed economic planning. \nCompetition acts as a regulatory mechanism for market systems, with government providing regulations where the market cannot be expected to regulate itself. Regulations help to mitigate negative externalities of goods and services when the private equilibrium of the market does not match the social equilibrium. One example of this is with regards to building codes, which if absent in a purely competition regulated market system, might result in several horrific injuries or deaths to be required before companies would begin improving structural safety, as consumers may at first not be as concerned or aware of safety issues to begin putting pressure on companies to provide them, and companies would be motivated not to provide proper safety features due to how it would cut into their profits.\nThe concept of \"market type\" is different from the concept of \"market structure\". Nevertheless, there are a variety of types of markets.\nThe different market structures produce cost curves based on the type of structure present. The different curves are developed based on the costs of production, specifically the graph contains marginal cost, average total cost, average variable cost, average fixed cost, and marginal revenue, which is sometimes equal to the demand, average revenue, and price in a price-taking firm.\nPerfect competition.\nPerfect competition is a situation in which numerous small firms producing identical products compete against each other in a given industry. Perfect competition leads to firms producing the socially optimal output level at the minimum possible cost per unit. Firms in perfect competition are \"price takers\" (they do not have enough market power to profitably increase the price of their goods or services). A good example would be that of digital marketplaces, such as eBay, on which many different sellers sell similar products to many different buyers. Consumers in a perfect competitive market have perfect knowledge about the products that are being sold in this market.\nImperfect competition.\nImperfect competition is a type of market structure showing some but not all features of competitive markets. In perfect competition, market power is not achievable due to a high level of producers causing high levels of competition. Therefore, prices are brought down to a marginal cost level. In a monopoly, market power is achieved by one firm leading to prices being higher than the marginal cost level. \nBetween these two types of markets are firms that are neither perfectly competitive or monopolistic. Firms such as Pepsi and Coke and Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft dominate the cola and video game industry respectively. These firms are in imperfect competition\nMonopolistic competition.\nMonopolistic competition is a situation in which many firms with slightly different products compete. Production costs are above what may be achieved by perfectly competitive firms, but society benefits from the product differentiation. Examples of industries with market structures similar to monopolistic competition include restaurants, cereal, clothing, shoes, and service industries in large cities.\nMonopoly.\nA monopoly is a market structure in which a market or industry is dominated by a single supplier of a particular good or service. Because monopolies have no competition, they tend to sell goods and services at a higher price and produce below the socially optimal output level. However, not all monopolies are a bad thing, especially in industries where multiple firms would result in more costs than benefits (i.e. natural monopolies).\nOligopoly.\nAn oligopoly is a market structure in which a market or industry is dominated by a small number of firms (oligopolists). Oligopolies can create the incentive for firms to engage in collusion and form cartels that reduce competition leading to higher prices for consumers and less overall market output. Alternatively, oligopolies can be fiercely competitive and engage in flamboyant advertising campaigns.\nMonopsony.\nA monopsony is a market where there is only one buyer and many sellers.\nBilateral monopoly.\nA bilateral monopoly is a market consisting of both a monopoly (a single seller) and a monopsony (a single buyer).\nOligopsony.\nAn oligopsony is a market where there are a few buyers and many sellers.\nGame theory.\nGame theory is a major method used in mathematical economics and business for modeling competing behaviors of interacting agents. The term \"game\" here implies the study of any strategic interaction between people. Applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches, such as auctions, bargaining, mergers &amp; acquisitions pricing, fair division, duopolies, oligopolies, social network formation, agent-based computational economics, general equilibrium, mechanism design, and voting systems, and across such broad areas as experimental economics, behavioral economics, information economics, industrial organization, and political economy.\nInformation economics.\nInformation economics is a branch of microeconomic theory that studies how information and information systems affect an economy and economic decisions. Information has special characteristics. It is easy to create but hard to trust. It is easy to spread but hard to control. It influences many decisions. These special characteristics (as compared with other types of goods) complicate many standard economic theories. The economics of information has recently become of great interest to many - possibly due to the rise of information-based companies inside the technology industry. From a game theory approach, the usual constraints that agents have complete information can be loosened to further examine the consequences of having incomplete information. This gives rise to many results which are applicable to real life situations. For example, if one does loosen this assumption, then it is possible to scrutinize the actions of agents in situations of uncertainty. It is also possible to more fully understand the impacts \u2013 both positive and negative \u2013 of agents seeking out or acquiring information.\nApplied.\nApplied microeconomics includes a range of specialized areas of study, many of which draw on methods from other fields.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This includes regional, national, and global economies. Macroeconomists study topics such as output/GDP (gross domestic product) and national income, unemployment (including unemployment rates), price indices and inflation, consumption, saving, investment, energy, international trade, and international finance.\nMacroeconomics and microeconomics are the two most general fields in economics. The focus of macroeconomics is often on a country (or larger entities like the whole world) and how its markets interact to produce large-scale phenomena that economists refer to as aggregate variables. In microeconomics, the focus of analysis is often a single market, such as whether changes in supply or demand are to blame for price increases in the oil and automotive sectors. \nFrom introductory classes in \"principles of economics\" through doctoral studies, the macro/micro divide is institutionalized in the field of economics. Most economists identify as either macro- or micro-economists.\nMacroeconomics is traditionally divided into topics along different time frames: the analysis of short-term fluctuations over the business cycle, the determination of structural levels of variables like inflation and unemployment in the medium (i.e. unaffected by short-term deviations) term, and the study of long-term economic growth. It also studies the consequences of policies targeted at mitigating fluctuations like fiscal or monetary policy, using taxation and government expenditure or interest rates, respectively, and of policies that can affect living standards in the long term, e.g. by affecting growth rates.\nMacroeconomics as a separate field of research and study is generally recognized to start in 1936, when John Maynard Keynes published his \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\", but its intellectual predecessors are much older. The Swedish Economist Knut Wicksell who wrote the book \"Interest and Prices\" (1898), translated into English in 1936 can be considered to be the pioneer of macroeconomics, while Keynes who introduced national income accounting and various related concepts can be said to be the founding father of macroeconomics as a formal subject. Since World War II, various macroeconomic schools of thought like Keynesians, monetarists, new classical and new Keynesian economists have made contributions to the development of the macroeconomic research mainstream.\nBasic macroeconomic concepts.\nMacroeconomics encompasses a variety of concepts and variables, but above all the three central macroeconomic variables are output, unemployment, and inflation. Besides, the time horizon varies for different types of macroeconomic topics, and this distinction is crucial for many research and policy debates. A further important dimension is that of an economy's openness, economic theory distinguishing sharply between closed economies and open economies.\nTime frame.\nIt is usual to distinguish between three time horizons in macroeconomics, each having its own focus on e.g. the determination of output:\nOutput and income.\nNational output is the total amount of everything a country produces in a given period of time. Everything that is produced and sold generates an equal amount of income. The total net output of the economy is usually measured as gross domestic product (GDP). Adding net factor incomes from abroad to GDP produces gross national income (GNI), which measures total income of all residents in the economy. In most countries, the difference between GDP and GNI are modest so that GDP can approximately be treated as total income of all the inhabitants as well, but in some countries, e.g. countries with very large net foreign assets (or debt), the difference may be considerable.\nEconomists interested in long-run increases in output study economic growth. Advances in technology, accumulation of machinery and other capital, and better education and human capital, are all factors that lead to increased economic output over time. However, output does not always increase consistently over time. Business cycles can cause short-term drops in output called recessions. Economists look for macroeconomic policies that prevent economies from slipping into either recessions or overheating and that lead to higher productivity levels and standards of living.\nUnemployment.\nThe amount of unemployment in an economy is measured by the unemployment rate, i.e. the percentage of persons in the labor force who do not have a job, but who are actively looking for one. People who are retired, pursuing education, or discouraged from seeking work by a lack of job prospects are not part of the labor force and consequently not counted as unemployed, either.\nUnemployment has a short-run cyclical component which depends on the business cycle, and a more permanent structural component, which can be loosely thought of as the average unemployment rate in an economy over extended periods, and which is often termed the natural or structural rate of unemployment.\nCyclical unemployment occurs when growth stagnates. Okun's law represents the empirical relationship between unemployment and short-run GDP growth. The original version of Okun's law states that a 3% increase in output would lead to a 1% decrease in unemployment.\nThe structural or natural rate of unemployment is the level of unemployment that will occur in a medium-run equilibrium, i.e. a situation with a cyclical unemployment rate of zero. There may be several reasons why there is some positive unemployment level even in a cyclically neutral situation, which all have their foundation in some kind of market failure:\nInflation and deflation.\nA general price increase across the entire economy is called inflation. When prices decrease, there is deflation. Economists measure these changes in prices with price indexes. Inflation will increase when an economy becomes overheated and grows too quickly. Similarly, a declining economy can lead to decreasing inflation and even in some cases deflation.\nCentral bankers conducting monetary policy usually have as a main priority to avoid too high inflation, typically by adjusting interest rates. High inflation as well as deflation can lead to increased uncertainty and other negative consequences, in particular when the inflation (or deflation) is unexpected. Consequently, most central banks aim for a positive, but stable and not very high inflation level.\nChanges in the inflation level may be the result of several factors. Too much aggregate demand in the economy will cause an overheating, raising inflation rates via the Phillips curve because of a tight labor market leading to large wage increases which will be transmitted to increases in the price of the products of employers. Too little aggregate demand will have the opposite effect of creating more unemployment and lower wages, thereby decreasing inflation. Aggregate supply shocks will also affect inflation, e.g. the oil crises of the 1970s and the 2021\u20132023 global energy crisis. Changes in inflation may also impact the formation of inflation expectations, creating a self-fulfilling inflationary or deflationary spiral.\nThe monetarist quantity theory of money holds that changes in the price level are directly caused by changes in the money supply. Whereas there is empirical evidence that there is a long-run positive correlation between the growth rate of the money stock and the rate of inflation, the quantity theory has proved unreliable in the short- and medium-run time horizon relevant to monetary policy and is abandoned as a practical guideline by most central banks today.\nOpen economy macroeconomics.\nOpen economy macroeconomics deals with the consequences of international trade in goods, financial assets and possibly factor markets like labor migration and international relocation of firms (physical capital). It explores what determines import, export, the balance of trade and over longer horizons the accumulation of net foreign assets. An important topic is the role of exchange rates and the pros and cons of maintaining a fixed exchange rate system or even a currency union like the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union, drawing on the research literature on optimum currency areas.\nGDP Equation Using Expenditure Approach.\nOne way to calculate Gross Domestic Product, or total net output, is the expenditure method. The GDP essentially tells you how big the economy is. The larger the GDP value, the bigger the economy. The expenditure approach involves looking at four main components: Consumer Spending, Government Spending, Investment Spending, and Net Exports. Consumer Spending is made up of ordinary consumers spending money on different kinds of products and also investing their money in residential markets. Government Spending involves the government spending money on goods and services and they may assist consumers or businesses with spending as well. For instance, purchasing physical capital for businesses. While transfer payments, which includes things like welfare or social security payments), are things that a government pays, it is not included in the final calculation of the expenditure approach because it is not paying for any final goods and services. Investment spending involves businesses spending money on physical capital/equipment to help with producing goods and services. Lastly, net exports is just exports minus imports. Exports are goods and services that a country is selling to people abroad and imports are goods and services that people from a country are receiving from abroad.\nHence, the equation for the expenditure approach to calculating the Gross Domestic Product is\nGDP = Consumer Spending(CS) + Government Spending(GS) + Investment Spending(IS) + Net Exports(EXP-IMP).\nGDP Deflator Equation &amp; Explanation.\nAnother concern with measuring a country's economic growth is that even though we see the GDP growing, that does not inherently mean the economy is growing. Most of the increase in GDP may just be due to inflation. To know whether this is the case, we have to calculate the GDP Deflator which adjusts the GDP for inflation.\nGDP Deflator = (Nominal GDP/Real GDP) x 100\nNominal GDP is GDP that includes inflation and Real GDP is GDP adjusted for inflation. To adjust for inflation means that the effect of inflation on the value was removed.\nA GDP Deflator of 100 indicates that there is no inflation nor deflation. A GDP Deflator value that is greater than 100 indicates that there is inflation. A GDP Deflator value that is less than 100 indicates that there is deflation.\nMoney Supply &amp; Money Multiplier: Equation &amp; Explanations.\nTwo common ways of determining the total money supply in an economy are M1 and M2. M2 consists of M1 plus a few other things. M1 is money that is liquid. Liquid refers to a financial asset being able to easily be converted into cash quickly and without losing a significant amount of value. This obviously includes cash but also things like coins, checking account deposits, etc. M2, however, includes time deposits, saving accounts, and money market mutual funds, which are not as liquid, in its measurement. It is important to know about the money supply as it affects interest rates and can also play a central role in monetary policy.\nThe Money Multiplier equation shows how the bank can expand the money supply through taking in deposits and lending money.\nThe Money Supply Reserve Multiplier equation is:\nMoney Multiplier = 1 / Reserve Requirement Ratio\nThe reserve requirement in this equation represents a proportion of money that the bank is required to keep in case they need to deal with withdrawals from customers. That proportion of money is based on the deposits of money made at the bank. So, if the reserve requirement is .20(20%), then the money multiplier is 5. This means that a $5 deposit would lead to a $25 increase in the money supply. This is because of the cycle of the bank keeping part of the deposit(in our example, 20%) and lending out the rest every time. These new spendable bank deposits are counted in the money supply even though the amount of physical currency did not change. So, while the physical amount of currency would still be $5, the amount of spendable money would be $25.\nDevelopment.\nMacroeconomics as a separate field of research and study is generally recognized to start with the publication of John Maynard Keynes' \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money\" in 1936. The terms \"macrodynamics\" and \"macroanalysis\" were introduced by Ragnar Frisch in 1933, and Lawrence Klein in 1946 used the word \"macroeconomics\" itself in a journal title in 1946. but naturally several of the themes which are central to macroeconomic research had been discussed by thoughtful economists and other writers long before 1936.\nBefore Keynes.\nIn particular, macroeconomic questions before Keynes were the topic of the two long-standing traditions of business cycle theory and monetary theory. William Stanley Jevons was one of the pioneers of the first tradition, whereas the quantity theory of money, labelled the oldest surviving theory in economics, as an example of the second was described already in the 16th century by Mart\u00edn de Azpilcueta and later discussed by personalities like John Locke and David Hume. In the first decades of the 20th century monetary theory was dominated by the eminent economists Alfred Marshall, Knut Wicksell and Irving Fisher.\nKeynes and Keynesian economics.\nWhen the Great Depression struck, the reigning economists had difficulty explaining how goods could go unsold and workers could be left unemployed. In the prevailing neoclassical economics paradigm, prices and wages would drop until the market cleared, and all goods and labor were sold. Keynes in his main work, the \"General Theory\", initiated what is known as the Keynesian Revolution. He offered a new interpretation of events and a whole intellectural framework - a novel theory of economics that explained why markets might not clear, which would evolve into a school of thought known as Keynesian economics, also called Keynesianism or Keynesian theory.\nIn Keynes' theory, aggregate demand - by Keynes called \"effective demand\" - was key to determining output. Even if Keynes conceded that output might eventually return to a medium-run equilibrium (or \"potential\") level, the process would be slow at best. Keynes coined the term liquidity preference (his preferred name for what is also known as money demand) and explained how monetary policy might affect aggregate demand, at the same time offering clear policy recommendations for an active role of fiscal policy in stabilizing aggregate demand and hence output and employment. In addition, he explained how the multiplier effect would magnify a small decrease in consumption or investment and cause declines throughout the economy, and noted the role that uncertainty and animal spirits can play in the economy.\nThe generation following Keynes combined the macroeconomics of the \"General Theory\" with neoclassical microeconomics to create the neoclassical synthesis. By the 1950s, most economists had accepted the synthesis view of the macroeconomy. Economists like Paul Samuelson, Franco Modigliani, James Tobin, and Robert Solow developed formal Keynesian models and contributed formal theories of consumption, investment, and money demand that fleshed out the Keynesian framework.\nMonetarism.\nMilton Friedman updated the quantity theory of money to include a role for money demand. He argued that the role of money in the economy was sufficient to explain the Great Depression, and that aggregate demand oriented explanations were not necessary. Friedman also argued that monetary policy was more effective than fiscal policy; however, Friedman doubted the government's ability to \"fine-tune\" the economy with monetary policy. He generally favored a policy of steady growth in money supply instead of frequent intervention.\nFriedman also challenged the original simple Phillips curve relationship between inflation and unemployment. Friedman and Edmund Phelps (who was not a monetarist) proposed an \"augmented\" version of the Phillips curve that excluded the possibility of a stable, long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. When the oil shocks of the 1970s created a high unemployment and high inflation, Friedman and Phelps were vindicated. Monetarism was particularly influential in the early 1980s, but fell out of favor when central banks found the results disappointing when trying to target money supply instead of interest rates as monetarists recommended, concluding that the relationships between money growth, inflation and real GDP growth are too unstable to be useful in practical monetary policy making.\nNew classical economics.\nNew classical macroeconomics further challenged the Keynesian school. A central development in new classical thought came when Robert Lucas introduced rational expectations to macroeconomics. Prior to Lucas, economists had generally used adaptive expectations where agents were assumed to look at the recent past to make expectations about the future. Under rational expectations, agents are assumed to be more sophisticated. Consumers will not simply assume a 2% inflation rate just because that has been the average the past few years; they will look at current monetary policy and economic conditions to make an informed forecast. In the new classical models with rational expectations, monetary policy only had a limited impact.\nLucas also made an influential critique of Keynesian empirical models. He argued that forecasting models based on empirical relationships would keep producing the same predictions even as the underlying model generating the data changed. He advocated models based on fundamental economic theory (i.e. having an explicit microeconomic foundation) that would, in principle, be structurally accurate as economies changed.\nFollowing Lucas's critique, new classical economists, led by Edward C. Prescott and Finn E. Kydland, created real business cycle (RBC) models of the macro economy. RBC models were created by combining fundamental equations from neo-classical microeconomics to make quantitative models. In order to generate macroeconomic fluctuations, RBC models explained recessions and unemployment with changes in technology instead of changes in the markets for goods or money. Critics of RBC models argue that technological changes, which typically diffuse slowly throughout the economy, could hardly generate the large short-run output fluctuations that we observe. In addition, there is strong empirical evidence that monetary policy does affect real economic activity, and the idea that technological regress can explain recent recessions seems implausible.\nDespite criticism of the realism in the RBC models, they have been very influential in economic methodology by providing the first examples of general equilibrium models based on microeconomic foundations and a specification of underlying shocks that aim to explain the main features of macroeconomic fluctuations, not only qualitatively, but also quantitatively. In this way, they were forerunners of the later DSGE models.\nNew Keynesian response.\nNew Keynesian economists responded to the new classical school by adopting rational expectations and focusing on developing micro-founded models that were immune to the Lucas critique. Like classical models, new classical models had assumed that prices would be able to adjust perfectly and monetary policy would only lead to price changes. New Keynesian models investigated sources of sticky prices and wages due to imperfect competition, which would not adjust, allowing monetary policy to impact quantities instead of prices. Stanley Fischer and John B. Taylor produced early work in this area by showing that monetary policy could be effective even in models with rational expectations when contracts locked in wages for workers. Other new Keynesian economists, including Olivier Blanchard, Janet Yellen, Julio Rotemberg, Greg Mankiw, David Romer, and Michael Woodford, expanded on this work and demonstrated other cases where various market imperfections caused inflexible prices and wages leading in turn to monetary and fiscal policy having real effects. Other researchers focused on imperferctions in labor markets, developing models of efficiency wages or search and matching (SAM) models, or imperfections in credit markets like Ben Bernanke.\nBy the late 1990s, economists had reached a rough consensus. The market imperfections and nominal rigidities of new Keynesian theory was combined with rational expectations and the RBC methodology to produce a new and popular type of models called dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. The fusion of elements from different schools of thought has been dubbed the new neoclassical synthesis. These models are now used by many central banks and are a core part of contemporary macroeconomics.\n2008 financial crisis.\nThe 2008 financial crisis, which led to the Great Recession, led to major reassessment of macroeconomics, which as a field generally had neglected the potential role of financial institutions in the economy. After the crisis, macroeconomic researchers have turned their attention in several new directions:\nGrowth models.\nResearch in the economics of the determinants behind long-run economic growth has followed its own course. The Harrod-Domar model from the 1940s attempted to build a long-run growth model inspired by Keynesian demand-driven considerations. The Solow\u2013Swan model worked out by Robert Solow and, independently, Trevor Swan in the 1950s achieved more long-lasting success, however, and is still today a common textbook model for explaining economic growth in the long-run. The model operates with a production function where national output is the product of two inputs: capital and labor. The Solow model assumes that labor and capital are used at constant rates without the fluctuations in unemployment and capital utilization commonly seen in business cycles. In this model, increases in output, i.e. economic growth, can only occur because of an increase in the capital stock, a larger population, or technological advancements that lead to higher productivity (total factor productivity). An increase in the savings rate leads to a temporary increase as the economy creates more capital, which adds to output. However, eventually the depreciation rate will limit the expansion of capital: savings will be used up replacing depreciated capital, and no savings will remain to pay for an additional expansion in capital. Solow's model suggests that economic growth in terms of output per capita depends solely on technological advances that enhance productivity. The Solow model can be interpreted as a special case of the more general Ramsey growth model, where households' savings rates are not constant as in the Solow model, but derived from an explicit intertemporal utility function.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s endogenous growth theory arose to challenge the neoclassical growth theory of Ramsey and Solow. This group of models explains economic growth through factors such as increasing returns to scale for capital and learning-by-doing that are endogenously determined instead of the exogenous technological improvement used to explain growth in Solow's model. Another type of endogenous growth models endogenized the process of technological progress by modelling research and development activities by profit-maximizing firms explicitly within the growth models themselves.\nEnvironmental and climate issues.\nSince the 1970s, various environmental problems have been integrated into growth and other macroeconomic models to study their implications more thoroughly. During the oil crises of the 1970s when scarcity problems of natural resources were high on the public agenda, economists like Joseph Stiglitz and Robert Solow introduced non-renewable resources into neoclassical growth models to study the possibilities of maintaining growth in living standards under these conditions. More recently, the issue of climate change and the possibilities of a sustainable development are examined in so-called integrated assessment models, pioneered by William Nordhaus. In macroeconomic models in environmental economics, the economic system is dependant upon the environment. In this case, the circular flow of income diagram may be replaced by a more complex flow diagram reflecting the input of solar energy, which sustains natural inputs and environmental services which are then used as units of production. Once consumed, natural inputs pass out of the economy as pollution and waste. The potential of an environment to provide services and materials is referred to as an \"environment's source function\", and this function is depleted as resources are consumed or pollution contaminates the resources. The \"sink function\" describes an environment's ability to absorb and render harmless waste and pollution: when waste output exceeds the limit of the sink function, long-term damage occurs. In 2024 a new approach was proposed which would institutionalize Inclusion, Sustainability and Resilience in Domestic Economic Governance.\nMacroeconomic policy.\nThe division into various time frames of macroeconomic research leads to a parallel division of macroeconomic policies into short-run policies aimed at mitigating the harmful consequences of business cycles (known as stabilization policy) and medium- and long-run policies targeted at improving the structural levels of macroeconomic variables.\nStabilization policy is usually implemented through two sets of tools: fiscal and monetary policy. Both forms of policy are used to stabilize the economy, i.e. limiting the effects of the business cycle by conducting expansive policy when the economy is in a recession or contractive policy in the case of overheating.\nStructural policies may be labor market policies which aim to change the structural unemployment rate or policies which affect long-run propensities to save, invest, or engage in education or research and development.\nMonetary policy.\nCentral banks conduct monetary policy mainly by adjusting short-term interest rates. The actual method through which the interest rate is changed differs from central bank to central bank, but typically the implementation happens either directly via administratively changing the central bank's own offered interest rates or indirectly via open market operations.\nVia the monetary transmission mechanism, interest rate changes affect investment, consumption, asset prices like listed companies' shares prices and house prices, and through exchange rate reactions export and import. In this way aggregate demand, employment and ultimately inflation is affected. Expansionary monetary policy lowers interest rates, increasing economic activity, whereas contractionary monetary policy raises interest rates. In the case of a fixed exchange rate system, interest rate decisions together with direct intervention by central banks on exchange rate dynamics are major tools to control the exchange rate.\nIn developed countries, most central banks follow inflation targeting, focusing on keeping medium-term inflation close to an explicit target, say 2%, or within an explicit range. This includes the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which are generally considered to follow a strategy very close to inflation targeting, even though they do not officially label themselves as inflation targeters. In practice, an official inflation targeting often leaves room for the central bank to also help stabilize output and employment, a strategy known as \"flexible inflation targeting\". Most emerging economies focus their monetary policy on maintaining a fixed exchange rate regime, aligning their currency with one or more foreign currencies, typically the US dollar or the euro.\nConventional monetary policy can be ineffective in situations such as a liquidity trap. When nominal interest rates are near zero, central banks cannot loosen monetary policy through conventional means. In that situation, they may use unconventional monetary policy such as quantitative easing to help stabilize output. Quantity easing can be implemented by buying not only government bonds, but also other assets such as corporate bonds, stocks, and other securities. This allows lower interest rates for a broader class of assets beyond government bonds. A similar strategy is to lower long-term interest rates by buying long-term bonds and selling short-term bonds to create a flat yield curve, known in the US as Operation Twist.\nFiscal policy.\nFiscal policy is the use of government's revenue (taxes) and expenditure as instruments to influence the economy.\nFor example, if the economy is producing less than potential output, government spending can be used to employ idle resources and boost output, or taxes could be lowered to boost private consumption which has a similar effect. Government spending or tax cuts do not have to make up for the entire output gap. There is a multiplier effect that affects the impact of government spending. For instance, when the government pays for a bridge, the project not only adds the value of the bridge to output, but also allows the bridge workers to increase their consumption and investment, which helps to close the output gap.\nThe effects of fiscal policy can be limited by partial or full crowding out. When the government takes on spending projects, it limits the amount of resources available for the private sector to use. Full crowding out occurs in the extreme case when government spending simply replaces private sector output instead of adding additional output to the economy. A crowding out effect may also occur if government spending should lead to higher interest rates, which would limit investment.\nSome fiscal policy is implemented through automatic stabilizers without any active decisions by politicians. Automatic stabilizers do not suffer from the policy lags of discretionary fiscal policy. Automatic stabilizers use conventional fiscal mechanisms, but take effect as soon as the economy takes a downturn: spending on unemployment benefits automatically increases when unemployment rises, and tax revenues decrease, which shelters private income and consumption from part of the fall in market income.\nComparison of fiscal and monetary policy.\nThere is a general consensus that both monetary and fiscal instruments may affect demand and activity in the short run (i.e. over the business cycle). Economists usually favor monetary over fiscal policy to mitigate moderate fluctuations, however, because it has two major advantages. First, monetary policy is generally implemented by independent central banks instead of the political institutions that control fiscal policy. Independent central banks are less likely to be subject to political pressures for overly expansionary policies. Second, monetary policy may suffer shorter inside lags and outside lags than fiscal policy. There are some exceptions, however: Firstly, in the case of a major shock, monetary stabilization policy may not be sufficient and should be supplemented by active fiscal stabilization. Secondly, in the case of a very low interest level, the economy may be in a liquidity trap in which monetary policy becomes ineffective, which makes fiscal policy the more potent tool to stabilize the economy. Thirdly, in regimes where monetary policy is tied to fulfilling other targets, in particular fixed exchange rate regimes, the central bank cannot simultaneously adjust its interest rates to mitigate domestic business cycle fluctuations, making fiscal policy the only usable tool for such countries.\nMacroeconomic models.\nMacroeconomic teaching, research and informed debates normally evolve around formal (diagrammatic or equational) macroeconomic models to clarify assumptions and show their consequences in a precise way. Models include simple theoretical models, often containing only a few equations, used in teaching and research to highlight key basic principles, and larger applied quantitative models used by e.g. governments, central banks, think tanks and international organisations to predict effects of changes in economic policy or other exogenous factors or as a basis for making economic forecasting.\nWell-known specific theoretical models include short-term models like the Keynesian cross, the IS\u2013LM model and the Mundell\u2013Fleming model, medium-term models like the AD\u2013AS model, building upon a Phillips curve, and long-term growth models like the Solow\u2013Swan model, the Ramsey\u2013Cass\u2013Koopmans model and Peter Diamond's overlapping generations model. Quantitative models include early large-scale macroeconometric model, the new classical real business cycle models, microfounded computable general equilibrium (CGE) models used for medium-term (structural) questions like international trade or tax reforms, Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models used to analyze business cycles, not least in many central banks, or integrated assessment models like DICE.\nSpecific models.\nIS\u2013LM model.\nThe IS\u2013LM model, invented by John Hicks in 1936, gives the underpinnings of aggregate demand (itself discussed below). It answers the question \"At any given price level, what is the quantity of goods demanded?\" The graphic model shows combinations of interest rates and output that ensure equilibrium in both the goods and money markets under the model's assumptions. The goods market is modeled as giving equality between investment and public and private saving (IS), and the money market is modeled as giving equilibrium between the money supply and liquidity preference (equivalent to money demand).\nThe IS curve consists of the points (combinations of income and interest rate) where investment, given the interest rate, is equal to public and private saving, given output. The IS curve is downward sloping because output and the interest rate have an inverse relationship in the goods market: as output increases, more income is saved, which means interest rates must be lower to spur enough investment to match saving.\nThe traditional LM curve is upward sloping because the interest rate and output have a positive relationship in the money market: as income (identically equal to output in a closed economy) increases, the demand for money increases, resulting in a rise in the interest rate in order to just offset the incipient rise in money demand.\nThe IS-LM model is often used in elementary textbooks to demonstrate the effects of monetary and fiscal policy, though it ignores many complexities of most modern macroeconomic models. A problem related to the LM curve is that modern central banks largely ignore the money supply in determining policy, contrary to the model's basic assumptions. In some modern textbooks, consequently, the traditional IS-LM model has been modified by replacing the traditional LM curve with an assumption that the central bank simply determines the interest rate of the economy directly.\nAD-AS model.\nThe AD\u2013AS model is a common textbook model for explaining the macroeconomy. The original version of the model shows the price level and level of real output given the equilibrium in aggregate demand and aggregate supply. The aggregate demand curve's downward slope means that more output is demanded at lower price levels. The downward slope can be explained as the result of three effects: the Pigou or real balance effect, which states that as real prices fall, real wealth increases, resulting in higher consumer demand of goods; the Keynes or interest rate effect, which states that as prices fall, the demand for money decreases, causing interest rates to decline and borrowing for investment and consumption to increase; and the net export effect, which states that as prices rise, domestic goods become comparatively more expensive to foreign consumers, leading to a decline in exports.\nIn many representations of the AD\u2013AS model, the aggregate supply curve is horizontal at low levels of output and becomes inelastic near the point of potential output, which corresponds with full employment. Since the economy cannot produce beyond the potential output, any AD expansion will lead to higher price levels instead of higher output.\nIn modern textbooks, the AD\u2013AS model is often presented slightly differently, however, in a diagram showing not the price level, but the inflation rate along the vertical axis, making it easier to relate the diagram to real-world policy discussions. In this framework, the AD curve is downward sloping because higher inflation will cause the central bank, which is assumed to follow an inflation target, to raise the interest rate which will dampen economic activity, hence reducing output. The AS curve is upward sloping following a standard modern Phillips curve thought, in which a higher level of economic activity lowers unemployment, leading to higher wage growth and in turn higher inflation.\nReal-life applications and data.\nTrump's proposed tariff policy in Feb 2025.\nIn early February 2025, United States of America President Donald Trump stated that he would be imposing a 25% tariff on imported goods from Mexico and Canada and a 10% tariff on imported goods from China for US consumers. A tariff in this case is a tax on imported goods and services. US consumers will be less likely to buy imports from those three countries due to the higher price they would have to pay. This was projected to reduce US imports by 15% and generate federal revenue of $100 billion.\nWhile imports from Mexico and Canada are important to the US, the US does not rely as much on Canadian and Mexican imports compared to Mexico's and Canada's economies being highly reliant on their exports to the USA. There would be higher production and grocery costs for the US but Mexico would have its economy reduced by 16% as the US takes in 80% of their car exports and 60% of their petroleum exports. In addition, Canada would have its economy reduced by similar amounts as the US takes in 70% of all of their exports.\nIn relation to the expenditure approach to calculating GDP, (Exports - Imports) would reduce significantly due to reduced exports, which means a negative net exports and a lower GDP. \nGDP deflator data.\nWhen looking at data presented by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, with a base year of 2017, we see that the GDP deflator has been trending upwards since then. The base year serves as the standard year to which we can compare whether GDP increased or decreased. The base year's prices are used when calculating Real GDP for a specific year. For instance, calculating 2020's GDP Deflator would be equivalent to 2020's Nominal GDP/2020's Real GDP (using 2017 prices). The GDP Deflator has risen from 100 to 126.22 in 2024 Q4.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A pioneer in the American film industry with a Hollywood career that spanned five decades, Pickford was one of the most popular actresses of the silent film era. Beginning her film career in 1909, Pickford became Hollywood's first millionaire by 1916, and, at the height of her career, had complete creative control of her films and was one of the most recognizable women in the world. Due to her popularity, unprecedented international fame, and success as an actress and businesswoman, she was known as the \"Queen of the Movies\". She was a significant figure in the development of film acting and is credited with having defined the type in cinema, a persona that also earned her the nickname \"America's Sweetheart\".\nIn 1919, she co-founded United Artists alongside Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, and D. W. Griffith, and was also one of the 36 founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1927. She was awarded the second Academy Award for Best Actress for her first sound film role in \"Coquette\" (1929) and received an Academy Honorary Award in 1976 in consideration of her contributions to American cinema. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Pickford as the 24th-greatest female star of Classical Hollywood Cinema.\nEarly life.\nMary Pickford was born Gladys Louise Smith in 1892, at 211 (later 561) University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, now the location of the Hospital for Sick Children. Her father, John Charles Smith, was the son of English Methodist immigrants, and worked a variety of odd jobs. Her mother, Charlotte Hennessey, was of Irish Catholic descent and worked for a time as a seamstress. Pickford had two younger siblings, both actors. Charlotte was billed as \"Lottie Pickford\" (born 1893) and John Charles Jr. was billed as \"Jack Pickford\" (born 1896). To please her husband's relatives, Pickford's mother baptized her children as Methodists, the religion of their father. John Charles Sr. was an alcoholic. He died on February 11, 1898, from a fatal blood clot caused by a workplace accident when he was a purser with Niagara Steamship.\nThe house was situated in a poor district of Toronto known as \"The Ward\" where disease was prevalent. When Gladys was four years old, her household was under infectious quarantine as a public health measure. Their devoutly Catholic maternal grandmother (Catherine Faeley Hennessey) asked a visiting Roman Catholic priest to baptize the children. Pickford was at this time baptized as Gladys Marie Smith. Gladys attended McCaul School on University Avenue.\nAfter being widowed in 1898, Charlotte Smith began taking in boarders, one of whom was a Mr. Murphy, the theatrical stage manager for Cummings Stock Company, who soon suggested that Gladys, then age seven, and Lottie, then age six, be given two small theatrical roles\u2014Gladys portrayed a girl and a boy, while Lottie was cast in a silent part in the company's production of \"The Silver King\" at Toronto's Princess Theatre (destroyed by fire in 1915, rebuilt, demolished in 1931), while their mother played the organ. Pickford subsequently acted in many melodramas with Toronto's Valentine Stock Company, ultimately playing the major child role in its version of \"The Silver King\". She concluded her early career in Toronto with the starring role of Little Eva in the Valentine production of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", adapted from the 1852 novel.\nCareer.\nEarly years.\nBy the early 1900s, theatre had become a family enterprise. Gladys, her mother, and two younger siblings toured the United States by rail, performing in third-rate companies and plays. After six impoverished years, Pickford allowed one more summer to land a leading role on Broadway, planning to quit acting if she failed. In 1905, she played the boy Freckles in Hal Reid's \"The Gypsy Girl\" on tour, and at the Star Theatre on Broadway. In 1906, Gladys, Lottie, and Jack Smith supported singer Chauncey Olcott on Broadway in \"Edmund Burke\". Gladys finally landed a supporting role in a 1907 Broadway play, \"The Warrens of Virginia\". The play was written by William C. deMille, whose brother, Cecil, appeared in the cast. David Belasco, the producer of the play, insisted that Gladys Smith assume the stage name Mary Pickford. After completing the Broadway run the play toured, including a stop in her home town of Toronto. It played at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in January 1909.\nOn April 19, 1909, the Biograph Company director D. W. Griffith screen-tested her at the company's New York studio for a role in the nickelodeon film \"Pippa Passes\". The role went to someone else but Griffith was immediately taken with Pickford. She quickly grasped that movie acting was simpler than the stylized stage acting of the day. Most Biograph actors earned $5 a day but, after Pickford's single day in the studio, Griffith agreed to pay her $10 a day against a guarantee of $40 a week.\nPickford, like all actors at Biograph, played both leading roles and bit parts, including mothers, ing\u00e9nues, charwomen, spitfires, slaves, Native Americans, spurned women, and a prostitute. As Pickford said of her success at Biograph:I played scrubwomen and secretaries and women of all nationalities ... I decided that if I could get into as many pictures as possible, I'd become known, and there would be a demand for my work. She appeared in 51 films in 1909\u2014almost one a week\u2014with her first starring role being in \"The Violin Maker of Cremona\" opposite future husband Owen Moore. While at Biograph, she suggested to Florence La Badie to \"try pictures\", invited her to the studio and later introduced her to D. W. Griffith, who launched La Badie's career.\nIn January 1910, Pickford traveled with a Biograph crew to Los Angeles. Many other film companies wintered on the West Coast, escaping the weak light and short days that hampered winter shooting in the East. Pickford added to her 1909 Biographs (\"Sweet and Twenty\", \"They Would Elope,\" and \"To Save Her Soul\", to name a few) with films made in California.\nActors were not listed in the credits in Griffith's company. Audiences noticed and identified Pickford within weeks of her first film appearance. Exhibitors, in turn, capitalized on her popularity by advertising on sandwich boards that a film featuring \"The Girl with the Golden Curls\", \"Blondilocks\", or \"The Biograph Girl\" was inside.\nPickford left Biograph in December 1910. The following year, she starred in films at Carl Laemmle's Independent Moving Pictures Company (IMP). IMP was absorbed into Universal Pictures in 1912, along with Majestic. Unhappy with their creative standards, Pickford returned to work with Griffith in 1912. Some of her best performances were in his films, such as \"Friends\", \"The Mender of Nets\", \"Just Like a Woman\", and \"The Female of the Species\". That year, Pickford also introduced Dorothy and Lillian Gish\u2014whom she had befriended as new neighbors from Ohio\u2014to Griffith, and each became a major silent film star, in comedy and tragedy, respectively. Pickford made her last Biograph picture, \"The New York Hat\", in late 1912.\nShe returned to Broadway in the David Belasco production of \"A Good Little Devil\" (1912). This was a major turning point in her career. Pickford, who had always hoped to conquer the Broadway stage, discovered how deeply she missed film acting. In 1913, she decided to work exclusively in film. The previous year, Adolph Zukor had formed Famous Players in Famous Plays. It was later known as Famous Players\u2013Lasky and then Paramount Pictures, one of the first American feature film companies.\nPickford left the stage to join Zukor's roster of stars. Zukor believed film's potential lay in recording theatrical players in replicas of their most famous stage roles and productions. Zukor first filmed Pickford in a silent version of \"A Good Little Devil\". The film, produced in 1913, showed the play's Broadway actors reciting every line of dialogue, resulting in a stiff film that Pickford later called \"one of the worst [features] I ever made ... it was deadly\". Zukor agreed; he held the film back from distribution for a year.\nPickford's work in material written for the camera by that time had attracted a strong following. Comedy-dramas, such as \"In the Bishop's Carriage\" (1913), \"Caprice\" (1913), and especially \"Hearts Adrift\" (1914), made her irresistible to moviegoers. \"Hearts Adrift\" was so popular that Pickford asked for the first of her many publicized pay raises based on the profits and reviews. The film marked the first time Pickford's name was featured above the title on movie marquees. \"Tess of the Storm Country\" was released five weeks later. Biographer Kevin Brownlow observed that the film \"sent her career into orbit and made her the most popular actress in America, if not the world\".\nHer appeal was summed up two years later by the February 1916 issue of \"Photoplay\" as \"luminous tenderness in a steel band of gutter ferocity\". Only Charlie Chaplin, who slightly surpassed Pickford's popularity in 1916, had a similarly spellbinding pull with critics and the audience. Each enjoyed a level of fame far exceeding that of other actors. Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, Pickford was believed to be the most famous woman in the world, or, as a silent-film journalist described her, \"the best known woman who has ever lived, the woman who was known to more people and loved by more people than any other woman that has been in all history\".\nStardom.\nPickford starred in 52 features throughout her career. On June 24, 1916, Pickford signed a new contract with Zukor that granted her full authority over production of the films in which she starred, and a record-breaking salary of $10,000 a week. In addition, Pickford's compensation was half of a film's profits, with a guarantee of $1.04 million (US$ in 2024), making her the first actress to sign a million-dollar contract. She also became vice-president of Pickford Film Corporation.\nOccasionally, she played a child, in films such as \"The Poor Little Rich Girl\" (1917), \"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\" (1917), \"Daddy-Long-Legs\" (1919), and \"Pollyanna\" (1920). Pickford's fans were devoted to these \"little girl\" roles, but they were not typical of her career. Due to her lack of a normal childhood, she enjoyed making these pictures. Given how small she was at under five feet, and her naturalistic acting abilities, she was very successful in these roles. Douglas Fairbanks Jr., when he first met her in person as a boy, assumed she was a new playmate for him, and asked her to come and play trains with him, which she obligingly did.\nIn August 1918, Pickford's contract expired and, when refusing Zukor's terms for a renewal, she was offered $250,000 to leave the motion picture business. She declined, and went to First National Pictures, which agreed to her terms. In 1919, Pickford, along with D. W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks, formed the independent film production company United Artists. Through United Artists, Pickford continued to produce and perform in her own movies; she could also distribute them as she chose. In 1920, Pickford's film \"Pollyanna\" grossed around US$. The following year, Pickford's film \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\" was also a success, and in 1923, \"Rosita\" grossed over $1 million as well. During this period, she also made \"Little Annie Rooney\" (1925), another film in which Pickford played a child, \"Sparrows\" (1926), which blended the Dickensian with newly minted German expressionist style, and \"My Best Girl\" (1927), a romantic comedy featuring her future husband Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers.\nThe arrival of sound was her undoing. Pickford underestimated the value of adding sound to movies, claiming that \"adding sound to movies would be like putting lipstick on the Venus de Milo\".\nShe played a reckless socialite in \"Coquette\" (1929), her first talkie, a role for which her famous ringlets were cut into a 1920s bob. Pickford had already cut her hair in the wake of her mother's death in 1928. Fans were shocked at the transformation. Pickford's hair had become a symbol of female virtue, and when she cut it, the act made front-page news in \"The New York Times\" and other papers. \"Coquette\" was a success and won her an Academy Award for Best Actress, although this was highly controversial. The public failed to respond to her in the more sophisticated roles. Like most movie stars of the silent era, Pickford found her career fading as talkies became more popular among audiences.\nHer next film, \"The Taming of The Shrew\", made with husband Douglas Fairbanks, was not well received at the box office. Established Hollywood actors were panicked by the impending arrival of the talkies. On March 29, 1928, \"The Dodge Brothers Hour\" was broadcast from Pickford's bungalow, featuring Fairbanks, Chaplin, Norma Talmadge, Gloria Swanson, John Barrymore, D. W. Griffith, and Dolores del R\u00edo, among others. They spoke on the radio show to prove that they could meet the challenge of talking movies.\nA transition in the roles Pickford selected came when she was in her late thirties, no longer able to play the children, teenage spitfires, and feisty young women so adored by her fans, and not suited for the glamorous and vampish heroines of early sound. In 1933, she underwent a Technicolor screen test for an animated/live-action film version of \"Alice in Wonderland\", but Walt Disney discarded the project when Paramount Pictures released its own version of the book. Only one Technicolor still of her screen test still exists.\nShe retired from film acting in 1933 following three costly failures with her last film appearance being \"Secrets\". She appeared on stage in Chicago in 1934 in the play \"The Church Mouse\" and went on tour in 1935, starting in Seattle with the stage version of \"Coquette\". She also appeared in a season of radio plays for NBC in 1935 and CBS in 1936. In 1936, she became vice-president of United Artists and continued to produce films for others, including \"One Rainy Afternoon\" (1936), \"The Gay Desperado\" (1936), \"Sleep, My Love\" (1948; with Claudette Colbert), and \"Love Happy\" (1949), with the Marx Brothers.\nThe film industry.\nPickford used her stature in the movie industry to promote a variety of causes. Although her image depicted fragility and innocence, she proved to be a strong businesswoman who took control of her career in a cutthroat industry.\nDuring World War I, she promoted the sale of liberty bonds, making an intensive series of fund-raising speeches, beginning in Washington, D.C., where she sold bonds alongside Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Theda Bara, and Marie Dressler. Five days later she spoke on Wall Street to an estimated 50,000 people. Though Canadian-born, she was a powerful symbol of American culture, kissing the American flag for cameras and auctioning one of her world-famous curls for $15,000. In a single speech in Chicago, she sold an estimated five million dollars' worth of bonds. She was christened the U.S. Navy's official \"Little Sister\"; the Army named two cannons after her and made her an honorary colonel.\nIn 1916, Pickford and Constance Adams DeMille, wife of director Cecil B. DeMille, helped found the Hollywood Studio Club, a dormitory for young women involved in the motion picture business. At the end of World War I, Pickford conceived of the Motion Picture Relief Fund, an organization to help financially needy actors. Leftover funds from her work selling Liberty Bonds were put toward its creation, and in 1921, the Motion Picture Relief Fund (MPRF) was officially incorporated, with Joseph Schenck voted its first president and Pickford its vice president. In 1932, Pickford spearheaded the \"Payroll Pledge Program\", a payroll-deduction plan for studio workers who gave one half of one percent of their earnings to the MPRF. As a result, in 1940, the Fund was able to purchase land and build the Motion Picture Country House and Hospital, in Woodland Hills, California.\nAn astute businesswoman, Pickford became her own producer within three years of her start in features. According to her Foundation, \"she oversaw every aspect of the making of her films, from hiring talent and crew to overseeing the script, the shooting, the editing, to the final release and promotion of each project\". She demanded (and received) these powers in 1916, when she was under contract to Zukor's Famous Players in Famous Plays (later Paramount). Zukor acquiesced to her refusal to participate in block-booking, the widespread practice of forcing an exhibitor to show a bad film of the studio's choosing to also be able to show a Pickford film. In 1916, Pickford's films were distributed, singly, through a special distribution unit called Artcraft. The Mary Pickford Corporation was briefly Pickford's motion-picture production company.\nIn 1919, she increased her power by co-founding United Artists (UA) with Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, and her soon-to-be husband, Douglas Fairbanks. Before UA's creation, Hollywood studios were vertically integrated, not only producing films but forming chains of theaters. Distributors (also part of the studios) arranged for company productions to be shown in the company's movie venues. Filmmakers relied on the studios for bookings; in return they put up with what many considered creative interference.\nUnited Artists broke from this tradition. It was solely a distribution company, offering independent film producers access to its own screens as well as the rental of temporarily unbooked cinemas owned by other companies. In 1919, Pickford established The Mary Pickford Company, that was devoted exclusively to producing films distributed by United Artists. With the film \"Pollyanna\" being Mary's first film distributed by The United Artists. Pickford and Fairbanks produced and shot their films after 1920 at the jointly owned Pickford-Fairbanks studio on Santa Monica Boulevard. The producers who signed with UA were true independents, producing, creating and controlling their work to an unprecedented degree. As a co-founder, as well as the producer and star of her own films, Pickford became the most powerful woman who has ever worked in Hollywood. By 1930, her acting career had largely faded. After retiring three years later, however, she continued to produce films for United Artists. She and Chaplin remained partners in the company for decades. Chaplin left the company in 1955, and Pickford followed suit in 1956, selling her remaining shares for $3 million.\nShe had purchased the rights to many of her early silent films with the intention of burning them on her death, but in 1970 she agreed to donate 50 of her Biograph films to the American Film Institute. In 1976, she received an Academy Honorary Award for her contribution to American film.\nPersonal life.\nPickford was married three times. She married Owen Moore, an Irish-born silent film actor, on January 7, 1911. It is rumored she became pregnant by Moore in the early 1910s and had a miscarriage or an abortion. Some accounts suggest this resulted in her later inability to have children. The couple's marriage was strained by Moore's alcoholism, insecurity about living in the shadow of Pickford's fame, and bouts of domestic violence. The couple lived together on-and-off for several years.\nPickford became secretly involved in a relationship with Douglas Fairbanks. They toured the U.S. together in 1918 to promote liberty bond sales for the World War I effort. Around this time, Pickford also suffered from the flu during the 1918 flu pandemic. Pickford divorced Moore on March 2, 1920, after she agreed to his $100,000 demand for a settlement ($1.5 million in 2023, adjusted for inflation). She married Fairbanks just days later on March 28, 1920, in what was described as the \"marriage of the century\" and they were referred to as the King and Queen of Hollywood. They went to Europe for their honeymoon; fans in London and in Paris caused riots trying to get to the famous couple. The couple's triumphant return to Hollywood was witnessed by vast crowds who turned out to hail them at railway stations across the United States.\n\"The Mark of Zorro\" (1920) and a series of other swashbucklers gave the popular Fairbanks a more romantic, heroic image. Pickford continued to epitomize the virtuous but fiery girl next door. Even at private parties, people instinctively stood up when Pickford entered a room; she and her husband were often referred to as \"Hollywood royalty\". Their international reputations were broad. Foreign heads of state and dignitaries who visited the White House often asked if they could also visit Pickfair, the couple's mansion in Beverly Hills.\nDinners at Pickfair became celebrity events. Charlie Chaplin, Fairbanks' best friend, was often present. Other guests included George Bernard Shaw, Albert Einstein, Elinor Glyn, Helen Keller, H. G. Wells, Lord Mountbatten, Fritz Kreisler, Amelia Earhart, F. Scott Fitzgerald, No\u00ebl Coward, Max Reinhardt, Baron Nishi, Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Austen Chamberlain, Sir Harry Lauder, and Meher Baba, among others. However, the public nature of Pickford's second marriage strained it to the breaking point. Both she and Fairbanks had little time off from producing and acting in their films. They were also constantly on display as America's unofficial ambassadors to the world, leading parades, cutting ribbons, and making speeches. When their film careers both began to flounder at the end of the silent era, Fairbanks' restless nature prompted him to overseas travel (something which Pickford did not enjoy). When Fairbanks' romance with Sylvia, Lady Ashley became public in the early 1930s, he and Pickford separated. They divorced January 10, 1936. Fairbanks' son, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., by his first wife claimed his father and Pickford long regretted their inability to reconcile.\nOn June 24, 1937, Pickford married her third and last husband, actor and band leader Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers. They adopted two children: Ronald Charles (born 1936, adopted 1943, a.k.a. Ronnie Pickford Rogers), and Roxanne (born 1942, adopted 1944). A PBS \"American Experience\" documentary described Pickford's relationship with her children as tense. She criticized their physical imperfections, including Ronnie's small stature and Roxanne's crooked teeth. Both children later said their mother was too self-absorbed to provide real maternal love. In 2003, Ronnie recalled that \"Things didn't work out that much, you know. But I'll never forget her. I think that she was a good woman\".\nIn 1948, Pickford and Rogers built a seven-bedroom, eight-bathroom, estate on at the B Bar H Ranch, California, where they lived and then later sold.\nPolitical views.\nPickford supported Thomas Dewey in the 1944 United States presidential election, Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election, and Ronald Reagan in his race for governor in 1966. She was a charter member of the Hollywood Republican Committee.\nLater years and death.\nAfter retiring from the screen, Pickford became an alcoholic, as her father had been. Her mother Charlotte died of breast cancer in March 1928. Her siblings, Jack and Lottie, died of alcohol-related causes in 1933 and 1936. These deaths, her divorce from Fairbanks, and the end of silent films left Pickford deeply depressed. Her relationship with her adopted children, Roxanne and Ronald, was turbulent at best. Pickford withdrew and gradually became a recluse, remaining almost entirely at Pickfair and allowing visits only from Lillian Gish, her stepson Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and a few select others. In 1955, she published her memoirs, \"Sunshine and Shadow\". She had previously published \"Why Not Try God\" in 1934, an essay on spirituality and personal growth, \"My Rendezvous with Life\" (1935), an essay on death and her belief in an afterlife and also a novel in 1935, \"The Demi-Widow\".\nIn the mid-1960s, Pickford often received visitors only by telephone, speaking to them from her bedroom. Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers often gave guests tours of Pickfair, including views of a genuine western bar Pickford had bought for Douglas Fairbanks, and a portrait of Pickford in the drawing room. A print of this image now hangs in the Library of Congress. When Pickford received an Academy Honorary Award in 1976, the Academy sent a TV crew to her house to record her short statement of thanks\u2014offering the public a very rare glimpse into Pickfair Manor. Charitable events continued to be held at Pickfair, including an annual Christmas party for blind war veterans, mostly from World War I.\nPickford had automatically acquired American citizenship when she married Fairbanks, an American citizen, in 1920, two years before the Cable Act of 1922 required a naturalization process for married female partners of U.S. male citizens. She never took out papers to acquire naturalized U.S. citizenship. Her agent at MGM, William A. Orr, reported to the US Congress in 1932 that Pickford was an American citizen. Pickford also mistakenly believed that she had ceased to be a British subject upon marrying Fairbanks. However, she held and traveled under British and later (beginning in 1947) Canadian passports which she renewed regularly at the British and Canadian consulates in Los Angeles, but she never acquired an American passport nor took out papers for naturalization as an American citizen. She also owned a house in Toronto as well as a property on Yonge Street in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and spent her summer holidays in Banff, Alberta in Canada. Towards the end of her life, Pickford made arrangements with the Canadian Department of Citizenship to officially acquire Canadian citizenship because she wished to \"die as a Canadian\". Canadian authorities were not sure that she had ever lost her Canadian citizenship, given her passport status, but her request was approved and she was issued with official Canadian citizenship documents.\nOn May 29, 1979, Pickford died at a Santa Monica hospital of complications from a cerebral hemorrhage she had suffered the week before. She was interred in the Garden of Memory of the Forest Lawn Memorial Park cemetery in Glendale, California.\nPickford and Toronto.\nAlthough the Smith family left Toronto permanently in 1902, Pickford regularly returned to Toronto. When performing at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in 1909, she stayed with her grandmother Mrs. Sara Smith. In 1924, she visited her birth home and was photographed for postcards. She also visited the Christie Street Hospital to visit sick soldiers and visit the graves of her father and grandparents in Mount Pleasant Cemetery.\nAs Pickford's fame grew, the birth home on University Avenue was regularly visited by tour buses. However, by 1938, her birth home was boarded up and vacant waiting for urban renewal in The Ward. Pickford inquired about purchasing it, but remarked that she \"would have to buy the whole block\". The home was demolished in 1943 and 20 bricks were sent to Pickford in California.\nPickford owned a house on Dewson Street, where her aunt lived. This house was sold for CA$ and the proceeds donated to build a bungalow in Toronto's East York suburb. The bungalow was the first prize in a lottery in Toronto to benefit war charities, and Pickford unveiled the home on May 26, 1943. Pickford also owned a property on Yonge Street.\nA bust and historical plaque marks her birthplace in Toronto, now the site of the Hospital for Sick Children. The plaque was unveiled by her husband Buddy Rogers in 1973. The bust by artist Eino Gira was added ten years later. Her date of birth is stated on the plaque as April 8, 1893. This can only be assumed to be because her date of birth was never registered; throughout her life, beginning as a child, she led many people to believe that she was a year younger than her real age, so that she appeared to be more of an acting prodigy and continued to be cast in younger roles, which were more plentiful in the theatre.\nPickford received a posthumous star on Canada's Walk of Fame in Toronto in 1999.\nFrom January 2011 until July 2011, the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) exhibited a collection of Mary Pickford memorabilia in the Canadian Film Gallery of the TIFF Bell LightBox building. In February 2011, the Spadina Museum, dedicated to the 1920s and 1930s era in Toronto, staged performances of \"Sweetheart: The Mary Pickford Story\", a one-woman musical based on the life and career of Pickford.\nOn August 20, 2019, TIFF announced Mati Diop as the recipient of the first Mary Pickford Award, an award \"for outstanding female talent\". The award has since been renamed the \"TIFF Emerging Talent Award\".\nPickford has been portrayed twice in the Canadian television period detective series Murdoch Mysteries. She was first played by Peyton Kennedy in the stand-alone Christmas special \"A Merry Murdoch Christmas\" (December 21, 2015). Pickford again appears in episode 12 of season 15 \"There's Something About Mary\" (January 3, 2022), portrayed by Eva Foote.\nLegacies.\nAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\nThe Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study at 1313 Vine Street in Hollywood, was dedicated in her honor by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. It had opened in 1948 as a radio and television studio facility and was bought by the Academy to house the Center. The Center houses the film archive of the Academy.\nIn 2007, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences sued the estate of the deceased Buddy Rogers' second wife, Beverly Rogers, in order to stop the public sale of one of Pickford's Oscars.\nIn Walks of Fames.\nPickford was awarded a star in the category of motion pictures on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6280 Hollywood Blvd.\nHer handprints and footprints are displayed at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California. Although the theater's official account credits Norma Talmadge as having inspired the theater's tradition of putting footprints in concrete when she accidentally stepped into wet concrete, in a short interview during the September 13, 1937, \"Lux Radio Theatre\" broadcast of a radio adaptation of \"A Star Is Born\", Sid Grauman related another version of how he got the idea to put hand and foot prints in the concrete, involving Pickford. He said it was \"pure accident. I walked right into it. While we were building the theatre, I accidentally happened to step in some soft concrete. And there it was. So, I went to Mary Pickford immediately. Mary put her foot into it\".\nIn 1993, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to her.\nBuildings.\nThe Mary Pickford Theater at the James Madison Memorial Building of the Library of Congress is named in her honor.\nThe Mary Pickford Auditorium at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, California is named in her honor.\nA first-run movie theatre in Cathedral City, California, is called The Mary Pickford Theatre, which was established on May 25, 2001. The theater is a grand one with several screens and is built in the shape of a Spanish Cathedral, complete with bell tower and three-story lobby. The lobby contains a historic display with original artifacts belonging to Pickford and Buddy Rogers, her last husband. Among them are a rare and spectacular beaded gown she wore in the film \"Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall\" (1924) designed by Mitchell Leisen, her special Oscar, and a jewelry box.\nMary Pickford Foundation.\nSince 2013, the Mary Pickford Foundation has sponsored \"The Pickford Composers\" and \"The Pickford Ensemble\" at Pepperdine University, composed of students learning to develop music scores for live players to support silent films onscreen.\nOn August 29, 2014, while presenting \"Behind the Scenes\" (1914) at Cinecon, film historian Jeffrey Vance announced he is working with the Mary Pickford Foundation on what will be her official biography.\nIn media.\nPickford is represented in Herg\u00e9's \"Tintin in America\" volume of the \"Tintin\" comic series.\nThe 1980 stage musical \"The Biograph Girl\", about the silent film era, features the character of Pickford.\nThe Google Doodle of April 8, 2017, commemorated Mary Pickford's 125th birthday.\n\"The Girls in the Picture\", a 2018 novel by Melanie Benjamin, is a historical fiction about the friendship of Mary Pickford and screenwriter Frances Marion.\nPickford was featured on a Canadian postage stamp in 2006.\nIn 2022, Pickford was portrayed by Christina Leonardi in \"\u200a\".\nOther legacies.\nThe \"Mary Pickford cocktail\" was created during the Prohibition era in her name. It has been attributed variously to bartenders Eddie Woelke or Fred Kaufmann of the Hotel Nacional de Cuba, during a trip Pickford made to Cuba.\nIn 2013, a copy of an early Pickford film that was thought to be lost (\"Their First Misunderstanding\") was found by Peter Massie, a carpenter tearing down an abandoned barn in New Hampshire. It was donated to Keene State College and is undergoing restoration by the Library of Congress for exhibition. The film is notable as being the first in which Pickford was credited by name.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Keystone possessed the first fully enclosed film stage, and Sennett became famous as the originator of slapstick routines such as pie-throwing and car-chases, as seen in the Keystone Cops films. He also produced short features that displayed his Bathing Beauties, many of whom had acting careers.\nAfter struggling with bankruptcy and the dominance of sound films in the early 1930s, Sennett was presented with an honorary Academy Award in 1938 for his contributions to the film industry, with the academy describing him as a \"master of fun, discoverer of stars, sympathetic, kindly, understanding comedy genius\".\nEarly life.\nBorn Michael Sinnott in Danville, Quebec, to parents of Irish Catholic descent, John Sinnott and Catherine Foy (or Foye). His parents married in 1879 in Tingwick, Quebec and moved the same year to Richmond, Quebec where Sinnott was hired as a laborer. By 1883, when Sennett's brother George was born, Sinnott was working as an innkeeper, a position he held for many years. Sennett's parents had all their children and raised their family in Richmond, then a small Eastern Townships village. At that time, Sennett's grandparents were living in Danville, Quebec. Sennett moved to Connecticut when he was 17 years old.\nHe lived for a while in Northampton, Massachusetts, where, according to his autobiography, he first got the idea to become an opera singer after seeing a vaudeville show. He said that the most respected lawyer in town, Northampton mayor (and future President of the United States) Calvin Coolidge, as well as Sennett's mother, tried to talk him out of his musical ambitions. In New York City, he took on the stage name Mack Sennett and became an actor, singer, dancer, clown, set designer, and director for the Biograph Company. A distinction in his acting career, often overlooked, is that he played Sherlock Holmes 11 times, albeit as a parody, between 1911 and 1913.\nKeystone Studios.\nWith financial backing from Adam Kessel and Charles O. Bauman of the New York Motion Picture Company, Sennett founded Keystone Studios in Edendale, California \u2013 now a part of Echo Park \u2013 in 1912. The original main building which was the first totally enclosed film stage and studio ever constructed, is still standing, as of 2023. Many successful actors began their film careers with Sennett, including Marie Dressler, Mabel Normand, Charlie Chaplin, Harry Langdon, Roscoe Arbuckle, Harold Lloyd, Raymond Griffith, Gloria Swanson, Charley Chase, Ford Sterling, Andy Clyde, Chester Conklin, Polly Moran, Slim Summerville, Louise Fazenda, The Keystone Cops, Carole Lombard, Bing Crosby, and W. C. Fields.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"In its pre-1920s heyday [Sennett's Fun Factory] created a vigorous new style of motion picture comedy founded on speed, insolence and destruction, which won them the undying affection of the French Dadaists...\" \u2014Film historian Richard Koszarski \nDubbed the King of Hollywood's \"Fun Factory\", Sennett's studios produced slapstick comedies that were noted for their hair-raising car chases and custard pie warfare, especially in the \"Keystone Cops \"series. The comic formulas, however well executed, were based on humorous situations rather than the personal traits of the comedians; the various social types, often grotesquely portrayed by members of Sennett's troupe, were adequate to render the largely \"interchangeable routines: \"Having a funny moustache, or crossed-eyes, or an extra two-hundred pounds was as much individualization as was required.\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"It is an axiom of screen comedy that a Shetland pony must never be put in an undignified position. People don't like it...immunity of pretty girls doesn't go as far as the immunity of the Shetland pony...you can have her fall into mud puddles. They will laugh at that. But the spectacle of a girl dripping with pie is unpleasing...movie fans don't like to see pretty girls smeared up with pastry. Shetland ponies and pretty girls are immune.\"\u2014 Mack Sennett, from \"The Psychology of Film Comedy\", November 1918\nFilm historian Richard Koszarski qualifies \"fun factory\" influence on comedic film acting:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSennett's first female comedian was Mabel Normand, who became a major star under his direction and with whom he embarked on a tumultuous romantic relationship. Sennett also developed the \"Kid Comedies\", a forerunner of the \"Our Gang\" films, and in a short time, his name became synonymous with screen comedy which were called \"flickers\" at the time. In 1915, Keystone Studios became an autonomous production unit of the ambitious Triangle Film Corporation, as Sennett joined forces with D. W. Griffith and Thomas Ince, both powerful figures in the film industry.\nSennett Bathing Beauties.\nAlso beginning in 1915, Sennett assembled a bevy of women known as the Sennett Bathing Beauties to appear in provocative bathing costumes in comedy short subjects, in promotional material, and in promotional events such as Venice Beach beauty contests. The Sennett Bathing Beauties continued to appear through 1928.\nIndependent production.\nIn 1917, Sennett gave up the Keystone trademark and organized his own company, Mack Sennett Comedies Corporation. Sennett's bosses retained the Keystone trademark and produced a cheap series of comedy shorts that proved unsuccessful. Sennett went on to produce more ambitious comedy short films and a few feature-length films.\nMany of Sennett's films of the early 1920s were inherited by Warner Bros. after Warner had merged with the original distributor, First National. Warner added music and commentary to several of these short subjects, and the new versions were released to theaters between 1939 and 1945. Many of Sennett's First National films physically deteriorated due to inadequate storage. Hence, many of Sennett's films from his most productive and creative period no longer exist.\nMove to Path\u00e9 Exchange.\nIn the mid-1920s, Sennett moved to Path\u00e9 Exchange distribution. In 1927, Hollywood's two most successful studios, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount Pictures, took note of the profits being made by smaller companies such as Path\u00e9 Exchange and Earle Hammons's Educational Pictures. MGM took over the Hal Roach comedy shorts from Path\u00e9, and Paramount reactivated its short subjects. Hundreds of other independent exhibitors and moviehouses switched from Path\u00e9 to the new MGM or Paramount shorts. Sennett fulfilled his contract to deliver silent comedies to Path\u00e9 through 1929 (these, like the \"Smith Family\" comedies, had already been completed before Sennett temporarily shut down his studio), but he began making sound films for Educational in late 1928.\nSound films.\nIn 1928, Sennett canceled all of his talent contracts and retooled his studio for the new talking-picture technology. His leading star at the time, Ben Turpin, was suddenly unemployed and moved to the Weiss Brothers studio.\nSennett's enthusiasm for sound on film was such that he was the first to get a talking two-reel comedy on the market. \"The Lion's Roar\", starring Johnny Burke and Billy Bevan, was released by Educational in December 1928, launching a four-year succession of Mack Sennett sound comedies. Sennett occasionally experimented with color as well.\nIn 1932, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Live Action Short Film in the comedy division for producing \"The Loud Mouth\" (with Matt McHugh, in the sports-heckler role later taken in Columbia Pictures remakes by Charley Chase and Shemp Howard). Sennett also won an Academy Award in the novelty division for his film \"Wrestling Swordfish\", also in 1932. He directed at least two two-reel comedies under the pseudonym Michael Emmes (the \"Emmes\" representing Sennett's initials): \"Hawkins and Watkins Inc.\" and \"Young Onions\" (both 1932).\nMack Sennett often clung to outmoded techniques, making his early-1930s films seem dated and quaint: he dressed some of his actors in eccentric makeups and loud costumes, which were amusing in the cartoonish silent films but ludicrous in the new, realistic atmosphere of talking pictures. Sennett was also having financial problems during the Great Depression. One of his biggest stars, Andy Clyde, left the studio after Sennett, wanting to economize, tried to cut Clyde's salary.\nIn 1932, Sennett attempted to re-enter the feature-film market on a grand scale with \"Hypnotized\". Remembering the successful campaign for his very first feature-length comedy \"Tillie's Punctured Romance\", which in 1914 was the longest comedy film ever produced, Sennett planned \"Hypnotized\" along similar lines as an epic production that would be shown first-run in select roadshow engagements. Sennett announced that \"Hypnotized\" would run 15 reels, or two-and-a-half hours, more than twice the length of a typical comedy feature of the day. Sennett wanted W. C. Fields to star as a carnival hypnotist, but Fields declined and the role went to Ernest Torrence, sharing the spotlight with blackface comedians Moran and Mack, \"The Two Black Crows\". Production was completed in August 1932, but fell far short of Sennett's grandiose predictions. The finished film ran an ordinary 70 minutes and was released through ordinary channels by World Wide Pictures (Educational's feature-film outlet) in December 1932.\nSennett was also having differences with his distributor, Earle Hammons of Educational. Jack White, Educational's leading producer, explained, \"We put Mack Sennett out of business. Theaters had [our] comedies booked solid. Sennett was very temperamental and wanted the exhibitor to do certain things, but they wouldn't stand for it. Sennett wouldn't stand for Hammons not telling him how much [money] he was cutting out of the grosses for himself. Sennett told him to go to hell.\" Sennett left Educational and signed with Paramount Pictures.\nSennett's sound comedies usually starred young featured players like Frank Albertson or established stage comics like Walter Catlett, but Sennett didn't establish any new star names until he signed both Bing Crosby and W. C. Fields for two-reel comedies. Crosby starred in six; Fields wrote and starred in four. Two other Sennett shorts were made with Fields scripts: \"The Singing Boxer\" (1933) with Donald Novis and \"Too Many Highballs\" (1933) with Lloyd Hamilton. Despite Paramount's wide distribution of the Crosby and Fields shorts, Sennett's studio did not survive the Depression. Sennett's partnership with Paramount lasted only one year and he was forced into bankruptcy in November 1933. His former protege Bing Crosby, whose popularity and income had skyrocketed, helped Sennett during a period of financial hardship. This act prompted columnist Lloyd Pantages to refer to Crosby as Sennett's \"guardian angel.\"\nOn January 12, 1934, Sennett was injured in an automobile accident that killed blackface performer Charles Mack (of Moran and Mack) in Mesa, Arizona.\nHis last work, in 1935, was as a producer-director for Educational, in which he directed Buster Keaton in \"The Timid Young Man\" and Joan Davis in \"Way Up Thar\". Sennett was not connected with the 1935 Vitaphone\nshort subject \"Keystone Hotel\", which featured several alumni from the Sennett studios, including Ben Turpin, Ford Sterling, Hank Mann, and Chester Conklin. The film was directed by Ralph Staub.\nSennett made one last attempt to continue working in the comedy field. By this time he had been supplanted as the major producer of two-reel comedies by Jules White at Columbia Pictures. White's brother, Jack White, recalled: \"When Jules and I were at Columbia in the 1930s, Sennett tried to come to Columbia but they wouldn't have him. He was finished, and the studio was happy with Jules.\" Sennett did sell some scripts and stories to Jules White, receiving screen credit under his \"Michael Emmes\" alias. Columbia really didn't need Sennett's services; the studio already had four producers and six directors on its short-subject payroll.\nMack Sennett went into semi-retirement at the age of 55, having produced more than 1,000 silent films and several dozen talkies during a 25-year career. His studio property was purchased by Mascot Pictures (later part of Republic Pictures), and many of his former staffers found work at Columbia.\nIn March 1938, Sennett was presented with an honorary Academy Award: \"for his lasting contribution to the comedy technique of the screen, the basic principles of which are as important today as when they were first put into practice, the Academy presents a Special Award to that master of fun, discoverer of stars, sympathetic, kindly, understanding comedy genius \u2013 Mack Sennett.\"\nLater projects.\nRumors abounded that Sennett would be returning to film production (a September 1938 publicity release indicated that he would be working with Stan Laurel of Laurel and Hardy), but apart from Sennett reissuing a couple of his Bing Crosby two-reelers to theaters, nothing happened.\nSennett did appear in front of the camera, however, in \"Hollywood Cavalcade\" (1939), itself a thinly disguised version of the Mack Sennett-Mabel Normand romance.\nIn 1949, he provided film footage for the first full-length comedy compilation film, \"Down Memory Lane\" (1949), written and narrated by Steve Allen. Sennett made a guest appearance in the film, and received a special \"Mack Sennett presents\" credit.\nSennett wrote a memoir, \"King of Comedy\", in collaboration with Cameron Shipp. The book was published in 1954, prompting TV producer Ralph Edwards to mount a tribute to Sennett for the television series \"This Is Your Life\". Sennett made a cameo appearance (for $1,000) in \"Abbott and Costello Meet the Keystone Kops\" (1955).\nSennett's last appearance in the national media was in the NBC radio program \"Biography in Sound\", relating memories of working with W.C. Fields. The program was broadcast February 28, 1956.\nPersonal life.\nSennett was never married, but his tumultuous relationship with actress Mabel Normand was widely publicized in the press at the time. According to the \"Los Angeles Times\", Sennett reportedly lived a \"madcap, extravagant life\", often throwing \"lavish parties\", and at the peak of his career he owned three homes.\nOn March 25, 1932, he became a United States citizen.\nDeath.\nSennett died on November 5, 1960, in Woodland Hills, California, aged 80. He was interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.\nTributes.\nFor his contribution to the motion picture industry, Sennett was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6712 Hollywood Boulevard. He was also inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2014.\nThe building of Sennett's original studio in Echo Park was deemed a historical landmark by The City of Los Angeles in 1982.\nBibliography.\nAnnotations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \nThe BFI's dedicated \"Filmography\" data visualization platform was taken offline in 2022, but the data it contained has been permanently moved to the BFI National Archive's Collections Information Database.\n \n \n \n \nHistoric Places LA was launched February 24, 2015, by Los Angeles Mayor Garcetti.&lt;br&gt;\n\"See .\"\n \n "}

The MPPC ended the domination of foreign films on American screens, standardized the manner in which films were distributed and exhibited within the United States, and improved the quality of American motion pictures by internal competition. It also discouraged its members' entry into feature film production, and the use of outside financing, both to its members' eventual detriment.\nCreation.\nThe MPPC was preceded by the Edison licensing system, in effect in 1907\u20131908, on which the MPPC was modeled. During the 1890s, Thomas Edison owned most of the major US patents relating to motion picture cameras. The Edison Manufacturing Company's patent lawsuits against each of its domestic competitors crippled the US film industry, reducing production mainly to two companies: Edison and Biograph, which used a different camera design. This left Edison's other rivals with little recourse but to import French and British films.\nSince 1902, Edison had also been notifying distributors and exhibitors that if they did not use Edison machines and films exclusively, they would be subject to litigation for supporting filmmaking that infringed Edison's patents. Exhausted by the lawsuits, Edison's competitors \u2014 Essanay, Kalem, Path\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res, Selig, and Vitagraph \u2014 approached him in 1907 to negotiate a licensing agreement, which Lubin was also invited to join. The one notable filmmaker excluded from the licensing agreement was Biograph, which Edison hoped to squeeze out of the market. No further applicants could become licensees. The purpose of the licensing agreement, according to an Edison lawyer, was to \"preserve the business of present manufacturers and not to throw the field open to all competitors.\"\nIn February 1909, major European producers held the Paris Film Congress in an attempt to create a similar European organisation. This group also included MPPC members Path\u00e9 and Vitagraph, which had extensive European production and distribution interests. This proposed European cartel ultimately failed when Path\u00e9, then still the largest company in the world, withdrew in April.\nThe addition of Biograph.\nBiograph retaliated for being frozen out of the trust agreement by purchasing the patent to the Latham film loop, a key feature of virtually all motion picture cameras then in use. Edison sued to gain control of the patent. After a federal court upheld the validity of the patent in 1907, Edison began negotiation with Biograph in May 1908 to reorganize the Edison licensing system. The resulting trust pooled 16 motion picture patents. Ten were considered of minor importance. The remaining six pertained one each to films, cameras, and the Latham loop, and three to projectors.\nPolicies.\nThe MPPC eliminated the outright sale of films to distributors and exhibitors, replacing it with rentals, which allowed quality control over prints that had formerly been exhibited long past their prime. The trust also established a uniform rental rate for all licensed films, thereby removing price as a factor for the exhibitor in film selection, in favor of selection made on quality, which in turn encouraged the upgrading of production values.\nThe MPPC also established a monopoly on all aspects of filmmaking. Eastman Kodak owned the patent on raw film stock, and the company was a member of the trust and thus agreed to sell stock only to other members. Likewise, the trust's control of patents on motion picture cameras ensured that only MPPC studios were able to film, and the projector patents allowed the trust to make licensing agreements with distributors and theaters \u2013 and thus determine who screened their films and where.\nThe patents owned by the MPPC allowed them to use federal law enforcement officials to enforce their licensing agreements and to prevent unauthorized use of their cameras, films, projectors, and other equipment. In some cases, the MPPC made use of hired thugs and mob connections to violently disrupt productions that were not licensed by the trust.\nContent.\nThe MPPC also strictly regulated the production content of their films, primarily as a means of cost control. Films were initially limited to one reel in length (13\u201317 minutes), although competition by independent and foreign producers by 1912 led to the introduction of two-reelers, and by 1913, three and four-reelers.\nBacklash and decline.\nMany independent filmmakers, who controlled from one-quarter to one-third of the domestic marketplace, responded to the creation of the MPPC by moving their operations to Hollywood, whose distance from Edison's home base of New Jersey made it more difficult for the MPPC to enforce its patents. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is headquartered in San Francisco, California, and covers the area, was averse to enforcing patent claims. Southern California was also chosen because of its beautiful year-round weather and varied countryside; its topography, semi-arid climate and widespread irrigation gave its landscapes the ability to offer motion picture shooting scenes set in deserts, jungles and great mountains. Hollywood had one additional advantage: if a non-licensed studio was sued, it was only a hundred miles to \"run for the border\" and get out of the US to Mexico, where the trust's patents were not in effect and thus equipment could not be seized.\nThe reasons for the MPPC's decline are manifold. The first blow came in 1911 when Eastman Kodak modified its exclusive contract with the MPPC to allow Kodak, which led the industry in quality and price, to sell its raw film stock to unlicensed independents. The number of theaters exhibiting independent films grew by 33 percent within twelve months, to half of all houses.\nAnother reason was the MPPC's overestimation of the efficiency of controlling the motion picture industry through patent litigation and the exclusion of independents from licensing. The slow process of using detectives to investigate patent infringements, and of obtaining injunctions against the infringers, was outpaced by the dynamic rise of new companies in diverse locations.\nDespite the rise in popularity of feature films in 1912\u20131913 from independent producers and foreign imports, the MPPC was very reluctant to make the changes necessary to distribute such longer films. Edison, Biograph, Essanay, and Vitagraph did not release their first features until 1914, after dozens, if not hundreds, of feature films, had been released by independents.\nPatent royalties to the MPPC ended in September 1913 with the expiration of the last of the patents filed in the mid-1890s at the dawn of commercial film production and exhibition. Thus the MPPC lost the ability to control the American film industry through patent licensing and had to rely instead on its subsidiary, the General Film Company, formed in 1910, which monopolized film distribution in US.\nThe outbreak of World War I in 1914 cut off most of the European market, which played a much more significant part of the revenue and profit for MPPC members than for the independents, which concentrated on Westerns produced for a primarily US market.\nThe end came with a federal court decision in \"United States v. Motion Picture Patents Co.\" on October 1, 1915, which ruled that the MPPC's acts went \"far beyond what was necessary to protect the use of patents or the monopoly which went with them\" and was, therefore, an illegal restraint of trade under the Sherman Antitrust Act. An appellate court dismissed the MPPC's appeal, and officially terminated the company in 1918.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18826", "revid": "1320239756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18826", "title": "MD5", "text": "Message-digest hashing algorithm\nThe MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function MD4, and was specified in 1992 as RFC 1321.\nMD5 can be used as a checksum to verify data integrity against unintentional corruption. Historically it was widely used as a cryptographic hash function; however it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities. It remains suitable for other non-cryptographic purposes, for example for determining the partition for a particular key in a partitioned database, and may be preferred due to lower computational requirements than more recent Secure Hash Algorithms.\nHistory and cryptanalysis.\nMD5 is one in a series of message digest algorithms designed by Professor Ronald Rivest of MIT (Rivest, 1992). When analytic work indicated that MD5's predecessor MD4 was likely to be insecure, Rivest designed MD5 in 1991 as a secure replacement. (Hans Dobbertin did indeed later find weaknesses in MD4.)\nIn 1993, Den Boer and Bosselaers gave an early, although limited, result of finding a \"pseudo-collision\" of the MD5 compression function; that is, two different initialization vectors that produce an identical digest.\nIn 1996, Dobbertin announced a collision of the compression function of MD5 (Dobbertin, 1996). While this was not an attack on the full MD5 hash function, it was close enough for cryptographers to recommend switching to a replacement, such as SHA-1 (also compromised since) or RIPEMD-160.\nThe size of the hash value (128 bits) is small enough to contemplate a birthday attack. MD5CRK was a distributed project started in March 2004 to demonstrate that MD5 is practically insecure by finding a collision using a birthday attack.\nMD5CRK ended shortly after 17 August 2004, when collisions for the full MD5 were announced by Xiaoyun Wang, Dengguo Feng, Xuejia Lai, and Hongbo Yu. Their analytical attack was reported to take only one hour on an IBM p690 cluster.\nOn 1 March 2005, Arjen Lenstra, Xiaoyun Wang, and Benne de Weger demonstrated construction of two X.509 certificates with different public keys and the same MD5 hash value, a demonstrably practical collision. The construction included private keys for both public keys. A few days later, Vlastimil Klima described an improved algorithm, able to construct MD5 collisions in a few hours on a single notebook computer. On 18 March 2006, Klima published an algorithm that could find a collision within one minute on a single notebook computer, using a method he calls tunneling.\nVarious MD5-related RFC errata have been published. \nIn 2009, the United States Cyber Command used an MD5 hash value of their mission statement as a part of their official emblem.\nOn 24 December 2010, Tao Xie and Dengguo Feng announced the first published single-block (512-bit) MD5 collision. (Previous collision discoveries had relied on multi-block attacks.) For \"security reasons\", Xie and Feng did not disclose the new attack method. They issued a challenge to the cryptographic community, offering a US$10,000 reward to the first finder of a different 64-byte collision before 1 January 2013. Marc Stevens responded to the challenge and published colliding single-block messages as well as the construction algorithm and sources.\nIn 2011 an informational RFC 6151 was approved to update the security considerations in MD5 and HMAC-MD5.\nSecurity.\nOne basic requirement of any cryptographic hash function is that it should be computationally infeasible to find two distinct messages that hash to the same value. MD5 fails this requirement catastrophically. On 31 December 2008, the CMU Software Engineering Institute concluded that MD5 was essentially \"cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use\". The weaknesses of MD5 have been exploited in the field, most infamously by the Flame malware in 2012. As of 2019[ [update]], MD5 continues to be widely used, despite its well-documented weaknesses and deprecation by security experts.\nA collision attack exists that can find collisions within seconds on a computer with a 2.6\u00a0GHz Pentium 4 processor (complexity of 224.1). Further, there is also a chosen-prefix collision attack that can produce a collision for two inputs with specified prefixes within seconds, using off-the-shelf computing hardware (complexity 239).\nThe ability to find collisions has been greatly aided by the use of off-the-shelf GPUs. On an NVIDIA GeForce 8400GS graphics processor, 16\u201318 million hashes per second can be computed. An NVIDIA GeForce 8800 Ultra can calculate more than 200 million hashes per second.\nThese hash and collision attacks have been demonstrated in the public in various situations, including colliding document files and digital certificates. As of 2015, MD5 was demonstrated to be still quite widely used, most notably by security research and antivirus companies.\nAs of 2019, one quarter of widely used content management systems were reported to still use MD5 for password hashing.\nOverview of security issues.\nIn 1996, a flaw was found in the design of MD5. While it was not deemed a fatal weakness at the time, cryptographers began recommending the use of other algorithms, such as SHA-1, which has since been found to be vulnerable as well.\nIn 2004 it was shown that MD5 is not collision-resistant. As such, MD5 is not suitable for applications like SSL certificates or digital signatures that rely on this property for digital security. Researchers additionally discovered more serious flaws in MD5, and described a feasible collision attack\u2014a method to create a pair of inputs for which MD5 produces identical checksums. Further advances were made in breaking MD5 in 2005, 2006, and 2007. In December 2008, a group of researchers used this technique to fake SSL certificate validity.\nAs of 2010, the CMU Software Engineering Institute considers MD5 \"cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use\", and most U.S. government applications now require the SHA-2 family of hash functions. In 2012, the Flame malware exploited the weaknesses in MD5 to fake a Microsoft digital signature.\nCollision vulnerabilities.\nIn 1996, collisions were found in the compression function of MD5, and Hans Dobbertin wrote in the RSA Laboratories technical newsletter, \"The presented attack does not yet threaten practical applications of MD5, but it comes rather close ... in the future MD5 should no longer be implemented ... where a collision-resistant hash function is required.\"\nIn 2005, researchers were able to create pairs of PostScript documents and X.509 certificates with the same hash. Later that year, MD5's designer Ron Rivest wrote that \"md5 and sha1 are both clearly broken (in terms of collision-resistance)\".\nOn 30 December 2008, a group of researchers announced at the 25th Chaos Communication Congress how they had used MD5 collisions to create an intermediate certificate authority certificate that appeared to be legitimate when checked by its MD5 hash. The researchers used a PS3 cluster at the EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland to change a normal SSL certificate issued by RapidSSL into a working CA certificate for that issuer, which could then be used to create other certificates that would appear to be legitimate and issued by RapidSSL. Verisign, the issuers of RapidSSL certificates, said they stopped issuing new certificates using MD5 as their checksum algorithm for RapidSSL once the vulnerability was announced. Although Verisign declined to revoke existing certificates signed using MD5, their response was considered adequate by the authors of the exploit (Alexander Sotirov, Marc Stevens, Jacob Appelbaum, Arjen Lenstra, David Molnar, Dag Arne Osvik, and Benne de Weger). Bruce Schneier wrote of the attack that \"we already knew that MD5 is a broken hash function\" and that \"no one should be using MD5 anymore\". The SSL researchers wrote, \"Our desired impact is that Certification Authorities will stop using MD5 in issuing new certificates. We also hope that use of MD5 in other applications will be reconsidered as well.\"\nIn 2012, according to Microsoft, the authors of the Flame malware used an MD5 collision to forge a Windows code-signing certificate.\nMD5 uses the Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction, so if two prefixes with the same hash can be constructed, a common suffix can be added to both to make the collision more likely to be accepted as valid data by the application using it. Furthermore, current collision-finding techniques allow specifying an arbitrary \"prefix\": an attacker can create two colliding files that both begin with the same content. All the attacker needs to generate two colliding files is a template file with a 128-byte block of data, aligned on a 64-byte boundary, that can be changed freely by the collision-finding algorithm. An example MD5 collision, with the two messages differing in 6 bytes, is:\n d131dd02c5e6eec4 693d9a0698aff95c 2fcab58712467eab 4004583eb8fb7f89\n 55ad340609f4b302 83e488832571415a 085125e8f7cdc99f d91dbdf280373c5b\n d8823e3156348f5b ae6dacd436c919c6 dd53e2b487da03fd 02396306d248cda0\n e99f33420f577ee8 ce54b67080a80d1e c69821bcb6a88393 96f9652b6ff72a70\n d131dd02c5e6eec4 693d9a0698aff95c 2fcab50712467eab 4004583eb8fb7f89\n 55ad340609f4b302 83e4888325f1415a 085125e8f7cdc99f d91dbd7280373c5b\n d8823e3156348f5b ae6dacd436c919c6 dd53e23487da03fd 02396306d248cda0\n e99f33420f577ee8 ce54b67080280d1e c69821bcb6a88393 96f965ab6ff72a70\nBoth produce the MD5 hash codice_1.\nThe difference between the two samples is that the leading bit in each nibble has been flipped. For example, the 20th byte (offset 0x13) in the top sample, 0x87, is 10000111 in binary. The leading bit in the byte (also the leading bit in the first nibble) is flipped to make 00000111, which is 0x07, as shown in the lower sample.\nLater it was also found to be possible to construct collisions between two files with separately chosen prefixes. This technique was used in the creation of the rogue CA certificate in 2008. A new variant of parallelized collision searching using MPI was proposed by Anton Kuznetsov in 2014, which allowed finding a collision in 11 hours on a computing cluster.\nPreimage vulnerability.\nIn April 2009, an attack against MD5 was published that breaks MD5's preimage resistance. This attack is only theoretical, with a computational complexity of 2123.4 for full preimage.\nApplications.\nMD5 digests have been widely used in the software world to provide some assurance that a transferred file has arrived intact. For example, file servers often provide a pre-computed MD5 (known as md5sum) checksum for the files, so that a user can compare the checksum of the downloaded file to it. Most unix-based operating systems include MD5 sum utilities in their distribution packages; Windows users may use the included PowerShell function \"Get-FileHash\", the included command line function \"certutil -hashfile &lt;filename&gt; md5\", install a Microsoft utility, or use third-party applications. Android ROMs also use this type of checksum.\nAs it is easy to generate MD5 collisions, it is possible for the person who created the file to create a second file with the same checksum, so this technique cannot protect against some forms of malicious tampering. In some cases, the checksum cannot be trusted (for example, if it was obtained over the same channel as the downloaded file), in which case MD5 can only provide error-checking functionality: it will recognize a corrupt or incomplete download, which becomes more likely when downloading larger files.\nHistorically, MD5 has been used to store a one-way hash of a password, often with key stretching. NIST does not include MD5 in their list of recommended hashes for password storage.\nMD5 is also used in the field of electronic discovery, to provide a unique identifier for each document that is exchanged during the legal discovery process. This method can be used to replace the Bates stamp numbering system that has been used for decades during the exchange of paper documents. As above, this usage should be discouraged due to the ease of collision attacks.\nAlgorithm.\nMD5 processes a variable-length message into a fixed-length output of 128 bits. The input message is broken up into chunks of 512-bit blocks (sixteen 32-bit words); the message is padded so that its length is divisible by 512. The padding works as follows: first, a single bit, 1, is appended to the end of the message. This is followed by as many zeros as are required to bring the length of the message up to 64 bits fewer than a multiple of 512. The remaining bits are filled up with 64 bits representing the length of the original message, modulo 264.\nThe main MD5 algorithm operates on a 128-bit state, divided into four 32-bit words, denoted A, B, C, and D. These are initialized to certain fixed constants. The main algorithm then uses each 512-bit message block in turn to modify the state. The processing of a message block consists of four similar stages, termed \"rounds\"; each round is composed of 16 similar operations based on a non-linear function F, modular addition, and left rotation. Figure 1 illustrates one operation within a round. There are four possible functions; a different one is used in each round:\nformula_1\nformula_2 denote the XOR, AND, OR and NOT operations respectively.\nPseudocode.\nThe MD5 hash is calculated according to this algorithm. All values are in little-endian.\n // \": All variables are unsigned 32 bit and wrap modulo 2^32 when calculating\"\n var \"int\" s[64], K[64]\n var \"int\" i\n // \"s specifies the per-round shift amounts\"\n // \"Use binary integer part of the sines of integers (Radians) as constants:\"\n for i from 0 to 63 do\n K[i] := floor(232 \u00d7 abs(sin(i + 1)))\n end for\n // \"(Or just use the following precomputed table):\"\n // \"Initialize variables:\"\n var \"int\" a0 := 0x67452301 // A\n var \"int\" b0 := 0xefcdab89 // B\n var \"int\" c0 := 0x98badcfe // C\n var \"int\" d0 := 0x10325476 // D\n // \"Pre-processing: adding a single 1 bit\"\n append \"1\" bit to message&lt; \n // Notice: the input bytes are considered as bit strings,\n // where the first bit is the most significant bit of the byte.\n // \"Pre-processing: padding with zeros\"\n append \"0\" bit until message length in bits \u2261 448 (mod 512)\n // Notice: the two padding steps above are implemented in a simpler way\n // in implementations that only work with complete bytes: append 0x80\n // and pad with 0x00 bytes so that the message length in bytes \u2261 56 (mod 64).\n append original length in bits mod 264 to message\n // \"Process the message in successive 512-bit chunks:\"\n for each \"512-bit\" chunk of padded message do\n break chunk into sixteen 32-bit words M[j], 0 \u2264 j \u2264 15\n // \"Initialize hash value for this chunk:\"\n var \"int\" A := a0\n var \"int\" B := b0\n var \"int\" C := c0\n var \"int\" D := d0\n // \"Main loop:\"\n for i from 0 to 63 do\n var \"int\" F, g\n if 0 \u2264 i \u2264 15 then\n F := (B and C) or ((not B) and D)\n g := i\n else if 16 \u2264 i \u2264 31 then\n F := (D and B) or ((not D) and C)\n g := (5\u00d7i + 1) mod 16\n else if 32 \u2264 i \u2264 47 then\n F := B xor C xor D\n g := (3\u00d7i + 5) mod 16\n else if 48 \u2264 i \u2264 63 then\n F := C xor (B or (not D))\n g := (7\u00d7i) mod 16\n // \"Be wary of the below definitions of a,b,c,d\"\n F := F + A + K[i] + M[g] // \"M[g] must be a 32-bit block\"\n A := D\n D := C\n C := B\n B := B + leftrotate(F, s[i])\n end for\n // \"Add this chunk's hash to result so far:\"\n a0 := a0 + A\n b0 := b0 + B\n c0 := c0 + C\n d0 := d0 + D\n end for\n var \"char\" digest[16] := a0 append b0 append c0 append d0 // \"(Output is in little-endian)\"\nInstead of the formulation from the original RFC 1321 shown, the following may be used for improved efficiency (useful if assembly language is being used \u2013 otherwise, the compiler will generally optimize the above code. Since each computation is dependent on another in these formulations, this is often slower than the above method where the nand/and can be parallelised):\n ( 0 \u2264 i \u2264 15): F := D xor (B and (C xor D))\n (16 \u2264 i \u2264 31): F := C xor (D and (B xor C))\nMD5 hashes.\nThe 128-bit (16-byte) MD5 hashes (also termed \"message digests\") are typically represented as a sequence of 32 hexadecimal digits. The following demonstrates a 43-byte ASCII input and the corresponding MD5 hash:\n MD5(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\") =\n 9e107d9d372bb6826bd81d3542a419d6\nEven a small change in the message will (with overwhelming probability) result in a mostly different hash, due to the avalanche effect. For example, adding a period to the end of the sentence:\n MD5(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\") = \n e4d909c290d0fb1ca068ffaddf22cbd0\nThe hash of the zero-length string is:\n MD5(\"\") = \n d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e\nThe MD5 algorithm is specified for messages consisting of any number of bits; it is not limited to multiples of eight bits (octets, bytes). Some MD5 implementations such as md5sum might be limited to octets, or they might not support \"streaming\" for messages of an initially undetermined length.\nImplementations.\nBelow is a list of cryptography libraries that support MD5:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These results, called \"theorems\", include previously proved theorems, axioms, and\u2014in case of abstraction from nature\u2014some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under consideration.\nMathematics is essential in the natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science, and the social sciences. Although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are independent of any scientific experimentation. Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics. Other areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics) but often later find practical applications.\nHistorically, the concept of a proof and its associated mathematical rigour first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's \"Elements\". Since its beginning, mathematics was primarily divided into geometry and arithmetics (the manipulation of natural numbers and fractions) until the 16th and 17th centuries, when algebra and infinitesimal calculus were introduced as new fields. Since then, the interaction between mathematical innovations and scientific discoveries has led to a correlated increase in the development of both. At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis of mathematics led to the systematization of the axiomatic method, which heralded a dramatic increase in the number of mathematical areas and their fields of application. The contemporary Mathematics Subject Classification lists more than sixty first-level areas of mathematics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAreas of mathematics.\nBefore the Renaissance, mathematics was divided into two main areas: arithmetic, regarding the manipulation of numbers, and geometry, regarding the study of shapes. Some types of pseudoscience, such as numerology and astrology, were not then clearly distinguished from mathematics.\nDuring the Renaissance, two more areas appeared. Mathematical notation led to algebra which, roughly speaking, consists of the study and the manipulation of formulas. Calculus, consisting of the two subfields \"differential calculus\" and \"integral calculus\", is the study of continuous functions, which model the typically nonlinear relationships between varying quantities, as represented by variables. This division into four main areas\u2014arithmetic, geometry, algebra, and calculus\u2014endured until the end of the 19th century. Areas such as celestial mechanics and solid mechanics were then studied by mathematicians, but now are considered as belonging to physics. The subject of combinatorics has been studied for much of recorded history, yet did not become a separate branch of mathematics until the 17th century.\nAt the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis in mathematics and the resulting systematization of the axiomatic method led to an explosion of new areas of mathematics. The 2020 Mathematics Subject Classification contains no less than sixty-three first-level areas. Some of these areas correspond to the older division, as is true regarding number theory (the modern name for higher arithmetic) and geometry. Several other first-level areas have \"geometry\" in their names or are otherwise commonly considered part of geometry. Algebra and calculus do not appear as first-level areas but are respectively split into several first-level areas. Other first-level areas emerged during the 20th century or had not previously been considered as mathematics, such as mathematical logic and foundations.\nNumber theory.\nNumber theory began with the manipulation of numbers, that is, natural numbers formula_1 and later expanded to integers formula_2 and rational numbers formula_3 Number theory was once called arithmetic, but nowadays this term is mostly used for numerical calculations. Number theory dates back to ancient Babylon and probably China. Two prominent early number theorists were Euclid of ancient Greece and Diophantus of Alexandria. The modern study of number theory in its abstract form is largely attributed to Pierre de Fermat and Leonhard Euler. The field came to full fruition with the contributions of Adrien-Marie Legendre and Carl Friedrich Gauss.\nMany easily stated number problems have solutions that require sophisticated methods, often from across mathematics. A prominent example is Fermat's Last Theorem. This conjecture was stated in 1637 by Pierre de Fermat, but it was proved only in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, who used tools including scheme theory from algebraic geometry, category theory, and homological algebra. Another example is Goldbach's conjecture, which asserts that every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. Stated in 1742 by Christian Goldbach, it remains unproven despite considerable effort.\nNumber theory includes several subareas, including analytic number theory, algebraic number theory, geometry of numbers (method oriented), Diophantine analysis, and transcendence theory (problem oriented).\nGeometry.\nGeometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. It started with empirical recipes concerning shapes, such as lines, angles and circles, which were developed mainly for the needs of surveying and architecture, but has since blossomed out into many other subfields.\nA fundamental innovation was the ancient Greeks' introduction of the concept of proofs, which require that every assertion must be \"proved\". For example, it is not sufficient to verify by measurement that, say, two lengths are equal; their equality must be proven via reasoning from previously accepted results (theorems) and a few basic statements. The basic statements are not subject to proof because they are self-evident (postulates), or are part of the definition of the subject of study (axioms). This principle, foundational for all mathematics, was first elaborated for geometry, and was systematized by Euclid around 300 BC in his book \"Elements\".\nThe resulting Euclidean geometry is the study of shapes and their arrangements constructed from lines, planes and circles in the Euclidean plane (plane geometry) and the three-dimensional Euclidean space.\nEuclidean geometry was developed without change of methods or scope until the 17th century, when Ren\u00e9 Descartes introduced what is now called Cartesian coordinates. This constituted a major change of paradigm: Instead of defining real numbers as lengths of line segments (see number line), it allowed the representation of points using their \"coordinates\", which are numbers. Algebra (and later, calculus) can thus be used to solve geometrical problems. Geometry was split into two new subfields: synthetic geometry, which uses purely geometrical methods, and analytic geometry, which uses coordinates systemically.\nAnalytic geometry allows the study of curves unrelated to circles and lines. Such curves can be defined as the graph of functions, the study of which led to differential geometry. They can also be defined as implicit equations, often polynomial equations (which spawned algebraic geometry). Analytic geometry also makes it possible to consider Euclidean spaces of higher than three dimensions.\nIn the 19th century, mathematicians discovered non-Euclidean geometries, which do not follow the parallel postulate. By questioning that postulate's truth, this discovery has been viewed as joining Russell's paradox in revealing the foundational crisis of mathematics. This aspect of the crisis was solved by systematizing the axiomatic method, and adopting that the truth of the chosen axioms is not a mathematical problem. In turn, the axiomatic method allows for the study of various geometries obtained either by changing the axioms or by considering properties that do not change under specific transformations of the space.\nToday's subareas of geometry include:\nAlgebra.\nAlgebra is the art of manipulating equations and formulas. Diophantus (3rd century) and al-Khwarizmi (9th century) were the two main precursors of algebra. Diophantus solved some equations involving unknown natural numbers by deducing new relations until he obtained the solution. Al-Khwarizmi introduced systematic methods for transforming equations, such as moving a term from one side of an equation into the other side. The term \"algebra\" is derived from the Arabic word \"al-jabr\" meaning 'the reunion of broken parts' that he used for naming one of these methods in the title of his main treatise.\nAlgebra became an area in its own right only with Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te (1540\u20131603), who introduced the use of variables for representing unknown or unspecified numbers. Variables allow mathematicians to describe the operations that have to be done on the numbers represented using mathematical formulas.\nUntil the 19th century, algebra consisted mainly of the study of linear equations (presently \"linear algebra\"), and polynomial equations in a single unknown, which were called \"algebraic equations\" (a term still in use, although it may be ambiguous). During the 19th century, mathematicians began to use variables to represent things other than numbers (such as matrices, modular integers, and geometric transformations), on which generalizations of arithmetic operations are often valid. The concept of algebraic structure addresses this, consisting of a set whose elements are unspecified, of operations acting on the elements of the set, and rules that these operations must follow. The scope of algebra thus grew to include the study of algebraic structures. This object of algebra was called \"modern algebra\" or abstract algebra, as established by the influence and works of Emmy Noether,\nand popularized by Van der Waerden's book \"Moderne Algebra\".\nSome types of algebraic structures have useful and often fundamental properties, in many areas of mathematics. Their study became autonomous parts of algebra, and include:\nThe study of types of algebraic structures as mathematical objects is the purpose of universal algebra and category theory. The latter applies to every mathematical structure (not only algebraic ones). At its origin, it was introduced, together with homological algebra for allowing the algebraic study of non-algebraic objects such as topological spaces; this particular area of application is called algebraic topology.\nCalculus and analysis.\nCalculus, formerly called infinitesimal calculus, was introduced independently and simultaneously by 17th-century mathematicians Newton and Leibniz. It is fundamentally the study of the relationship between variables that depend continuously on each other. Calculus was expanded in the 18th century by Euler with the introduction of the concept of a function and many other results. Presently, \"calculus\" refers mainly to the elementary part of this theory, and \"analysis\" is commonly used for advanced parts.\nAnalysis is further subdivided into real analysis, where variables represent real numbers, and complex analysis, where variables represent complex numbers. Analysis includes many subareas shared by other areas of mathematics which include:\nDiscrete mathematics.\nDiscrete mathematics, broadly speaking, is the study of individual, countable mathematical objects. An example is the set of all integers. Because the objects of study here are discrete, the methods of calculus and mathematical analysis do not directly apply. Algorithms\u2014especially their implementation and computational complexity\u2014play a major role in discrete mathematics.\nThe four color theorem and optimal sphere packing were two major problems of discrete mathematics solved in the second half of the 20th century. The P versus NP problem, which remains open to this day, is also important for discrete mathematics, since its solution would potentially impact a large number of computationally difficult problems.\nDiscrete mathematics includes:\nMathematical logic and set theory.\nThe two subjects of mathematical logic and set theory have belonged to mathematics since the end of the 19th century. Before this period, sets were not considered to be mathematical objects, and logic, although used for mathematical proofs, belonged to philosophy and was not specifically studied by mathematicians.\nBefore Cantor's study of infinite sets, mathematicians were reluctant to consider actually infinite collections, and considered infinity to be the result of endless enumeration. Cantor's work offended many mathematicians not only by considering actually infinite sets but by showing that this implies different sizes of infinity, per Cantor's diagonal argument. This led to the controversy over Cantor's set theory. In the same period, various areas of mathematics concluded the former intuitive definitions of the basic mathematical objects were insufficient for ensuring mathematical rigour.\nThis became the foundational crisis of mathematics. It was eventually solved in mainstream mathematics by systematizing the axiomatic method inside a formalized set theory. Roughly speaking, each mathematical object is defined by the set of all similar objects and the properties that these objects must have. For example, in Peano arithmetic, the natural numbers are defined by \"zero is a number\", \"each number has a unique successor\", \"each number but zero has a unique predecessor\", and some rules of reasoning. This mathematical abstraction from reality is embodied in the modern philosophy of formalism, as founded by David Hilbert around 1910.\nThe \"nature\" of the objects defined this way is a philosophical problem that mathematicians leave to philosophers, even if many mathematicians have opinions on this nature, and use their opinion\u2014sometimes called \"intuition\"\u2014to guide their study and proofs. The approach allows considering \"logics\" (that is, sets of allowed deducing rules), theorems, proofs, etc. as mathematical objects, and to prove theorems about them. For example, G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems assert, roughly speaking that, in every consistent formal system that contains the natural numbers, there are theorems that are true (that is provable in a stronger system), but not provable inside the system. This approach to the foundations of mathematics was challenged during the first half of the 20th century by mathematicians led by Brouwer, who promoted intuitionistic logic (which explicitly lacks the law of excluded middle).\nThese problems and debates led to a wide expansion of mathematical logic, with subareas such as model theory (modeling some logical theories inside other theories), proof theory, type theory, computability theory and computational complexity theory. Although these aspects of mathematical logic were introduced before the rise of computers, their use in compiler design, formal verification, program analysis, proof assistants and other aspects of computer science, contributed in turn to the expansion of these logical theories.\nStatistics and other decision sciences.\nThe field of statistics is a mathematical application that is employed for the collection and processing of data samples, using procedures based on mathematical methods such as, and especially, probability theory. Statisticians generate data with random sampling or randomized experiments.\nStatistical theory studies decision problems such as minimizing the risk (expected loss) of a statistical action, such as using a procedure in, for example, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and selecting the best. In these traditional areas of mathematical statistics, a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an objective function, like expected loss or cost, under specific constraints. For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence. Because of its use of optimization, the mathematical theory of statistics overlaps with other decision sciences, such as operations research, control theory, and mathematical economics.\nComputational mathematics.\nComputational mathematics is the study of mathematical problems that are typically too large for human, numerical capacity. Part of computational mathematics involves numerical analysis, which is the study of methods for problems in analysis using functional analysis and approximation theory. Numerical analysis broadly includes the study of approximation and discretization, with special focus on rounding errors. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing, also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially algorithmic-matrix-and-graph theory. Other areas of computational mathematics include computer algebra and symbolic computation.\nHistory.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"mathematics\" comes from the Ancient Greek word \"m\u00e1th\u0113ma\" (\"\"), meaning 'something learned, knowledge, mathematics', and the derived expression \"math\u0113matik\u1e17 t\u00e9khn\u0113\" (), meaning 'mathematical science'. It entered the English language during the Late Middle English period through French and Latin. \nSimilarly, one of the two main schools of thought in Pythagoreanism was known as the \"math\u0113matikoi\" (\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af)\u2014which at the time meant \"learners\" rather than \"mathematicians\" in the modern sense. The Pythagoreans were likely the first to constrain the use of the word to just the study of arithmetic and geometry. By the time of Aristotle (384\u2013322\u00a0BC) this meaning was fully established.\nIn Latin and English, until around 1700, the term \"mathematics\" more commonly meant \"astrology\" (or sometimes \"astronomy\") rather than \"mathematics\"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This change has resulted in several mistranslations: For example, Saint Augustine's warning that Christians should beware of \"mathematici\", meaning \"astrologers\", is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.\nThe apparent plural form in English goes back to the Latin neuter plural (Cicero), based on the Greek plural \"ta math\u0113matik\u00e1\" () and means roughly \"all things mathematical\", although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective \"mathematic(al)\" and formed the noun \"mathematics\" anew, after the pattern of \"physics\" and \"metaphysics\", inherited from Greek. In English, the noun \"mathematics\" takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to \"maths\" or, in North America, \"math\".\nAncient.\nIn addition to recognizing how to count physical objects, prehistoric peoples may have also known how to count abstract quantities, like time\u2014days, seasons, or years. Evidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000\u00a0BC, when the Babylonians and Egyptians began using arithmetic, algebra, and geometry for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for astronomy. The oldest mathematical texts from Mesopotamia and Egypt are from 2000 to 1800\u00a0BC. Many early texts mention Pythagorean triples and so, by inference, the Pythagorean theorem seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical concept after basic arithmetic and geometry. It is in Babylonian mathematics that elementary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) first appear in the archaeological record. The Babylonians also possessed a place-value system and used a sexagesimal numeral system which is still in use today for measuring angles and time.\nIn the 6th century BC, Greek mathematics began to emerge as a distinct discipline and some Ancient Greeks such as the Pythagoreans appeared to have considered it a subject in its own right. Around 300 BC, Euclid organized mathematical knowledge by way of postulates and first principles, which evolved into the axiomatic method that is used in mathematics today, consisting of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. His book, \"Elements\", is widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time. The greatest mathematician of antiquity is often held to be Archimedes (c.\u2009287\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009212 BC) of Syracuse. He developed formulas for calculating the surface area and volume of solids of revolution and used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus. Other notable achievements of Greek mathematics are conic sections (Apollonius of Perga, 3rd century BC), trigonometry (Hipparchus of Nicaea, 2nd century BC), and the beginnings of algebra (Diophantus, 3rd century AD).\nThe Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in India and were transmitted to the Western world via Islamic mathematics. Other notable developments of Indian mathematics include the modern definition and approximation of sine and cosine, and an early form of infinite series.\nMedieval and later.\nDuring the Golden Age of Islam, especially during the 9th and 10th\u00a0centuries, mathematics saw many important innovations building on Greek mathematics. The most notable achievement of Islamic mathematics was the development of algebra. Other achievements of the Islamic period include advances in spherical trigonometry and the addition of the decimal point to the Arabic numeral system. Many notable mathematicians from this period were Persian, such as Al-Khwarizmi, Omar Khayyam and Sharaf al-D\u012bn al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b. The Greek and Arabic mathematical texts were in turn translated to Latin during the Middle Ages and made available in Europe.\nDuring the early modern period, mathematics began to develop at an accelerating pace in Western Europe, with innovations that revolutionized mathematics, such as the introduction of variables and symbolic notation by Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te (1540\u20131603), the introduction of logarithms by John Napier in 1614, which greatly simplified numerical calculations, especially for astronomy and marine navigation, the introduction of coordinates by Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) for reducing geometry to algebra, and the development of calculus by Isaac Newton (1643\u20131727) and Gottfried Leibniz (1646\u20131716). Leonhard Euler (1707\u20131783), the most notable mathematician of the 18th century, unified these innovations into a single corpus with a standardized terminology, and completed them with the discovery and the proof of numerous theorems.\nPerhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the German mathematician Carl Gauss, who made numerous contributions to fields such as algebra, analysis, differential geometry, matrix theory, number theory, and statistics. In the early 20th century, Kurt G\u00f6del transformed mathematics by publishing his incompleteness theorems, which show in part that any consistent axiomatic system\u2014if powerful enough to describe arithmetic\u2014will contain true propositions that cannot be proved.\nMathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made to this very day. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January\u00a02006 issue of the \"Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society\", \"The number of papers and books included in the \"Mathematical Reviews\" (MR) database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9\u00a0million, and more than 75\u00a0thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical theorems and their proofs.\"\nSymbolic notation and terminology.\nMathematical notation is widely used in science and engineering for representing complex concepts and properties in a concise, unambiguous, and accurate way. This notation consists of symbols used for representing operations, unspecified numbers, relations and any other mathematical objects, and then assembling them into expressions and formulas. More precisely, numbers and other mathematical objects are represented by symbols called variables, which are generally Latin or Greek letters, and often include subscripts. Operation and relations are generally represented by specific symbols or glyphs, such as + (plus), \u00d7 (multiplication), formula_4 (integral), = (equal), and &lt; (less than). All these symbols are generally grouped according to specific rules to form expressions and formulas. Normally, expressions and formulas do not appear alone, but are included in sentences of the current language, where expressions play the role of noun phrases and formulas play the role of clauses.\nMathematics has developed a rich terminology covering a broad range of fields that study the properties of various abstract, idealized objects and how they interact. It is based on rigorous definitions that provide a standard foundation for communication. An axiom or postulate is a mathematical statement that is taken to be true without need of proof. If a mathematical statement has yet to be proven (or disproven), it is termed a conjecture. Through a series of rigorous arguments employing deductive reasoning, a statement that is proven to be true becomes a theorem. A specialized theorem that is mainly used to prove another theorem is called a lemma. A proven instance that forms part of a more general finding is termed a corollary.\nNumerous technical terms used in mathematics are neologisms, such as \"polynomial\" and \"homeomorphism\". Other technical terms are words of the common language that are used in an accurate meaning that may differ slightly from their common meaning. For example, in mathematics, \"or\" means \"one, the other or both\", while, in common language, it is either ambiguous or means \"one or the other but not both\" (in mathematics, the latter is called \"exclusive or\"). Finally, many mathematical terms are common words that are used with a completely different meaning. This may lead to sentences that are correct and true mathematical assertions, but appear to be nonsense to people who do not have the required background. For example, \"every free module is flat\" and \"a field is always a ring\".\nRelationship with sciences.\nMathematics is used in most sciences for modeling phenomena, which then allows predictions to be made from experimental laws. The independence of mathematical truth from any experimentation implies that the accuracy of such predictions depends only on the adequacy of the model. Inaccurate predictions, rather than being caused by invalid mathematical concepts, imply the need to change the mathematical model used. For example, the perihelion precession of Mercury could only be explained after the emergence of Einstein's general relativity, which replaced Newton's law of gravitation as a better mathematical model.\nThere is still a philosophical debate whether mathematics is a science. However, in practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists, and mathematics shares much in common with the physical sciences. Like them, it is falsifiable, which means in mathematics that, if a result or a theory is wrong, this can be proved by providing a counterexample. Similarly as in science, theories and results (theorems) are often obtained from experimentation. In mathematics, the experimentation may consist of computation on selected examples or of the study of figures or other representations of mathematical objects (often mind representations without physical support). For example, when asked how he came about his theorems, Gauss once replied \"durch planm\u00e4ssiges Tattonieren\" (through systematic experimentation). However, some authors emphasize that mathematics differs from the modern notion of science by not relying on empirical evidence.\nPure and applied mathematics.\nUntil the 19th century, the development of mathematics in the West was mainly motivated by the needs of technology and science, and there was no clear distinction between pure and applied mathematics. For example, the natural numbers and arithmetic were introduced for the need of counting, and geometry was motivated by surveying, architecture, and astronomy. Later, Isaac Newton introduced infinitesimal calculus for explaining the movement of the planets with his law of gravitation. Moreover, most mathematicians were also scientists, and many scientists were also mathematicians. However, a notable exception occurred with the tradition of pure mathematics in Ancient Greece. The problem of integer factorization, for example, which goes back to Euclid in 300 BC, had no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem, now widely used for the security of computer networks.\nIn the 19th century, mathematicians such as Karl Weierstrass and Richard Dedekind increasingly focused their research on internal problems, that is, \"pure mathematics\". This led to split mathematics into \"pure mathematics\" and \"applied mathematics\", the latter being often considered as having a lower value among mathematical purists. However, the lines between the two are frequently blurred.\nThe aftermath of World War II led to a surge in the development of applied mathematics in the US and elsewhere. Many of the theories developed for applications were found interesting from the point of view of pure mathematics, and many results of pure mathematics were shown to have applications outside mathematics; in turn, the study of these applications may give new insights on the \"pure theory\".\nAn example of the first case is the theory of distributions, introduced by Laurent Schwartz for validating computations done in quantum mechanics, which became immediately an important tool of (pure) mathematical analysis. An example of the second case is the decidability of the first-order theory of the real numbers, a problem of pure mathematics that was proved true by Alfred Tarski, with an algorithm that is impossible to implement because of a computational complexity that is much too high. For getting an algorithm that can be implemented and can solve systems of polynomial equations and inequalities, George Collins introduced the cylindrical algebraic decomposition that became a fundamental tool in real algebraic geometry.\nIn the present day, the distinction between pure and applied mathematics is more a question of personal research aim of mathematicians than a division of mathematics into broad areas. The Mathematics Subject Classification has a section for \"general applied mathematics\" but does not mention \"pure mathematics\". However, these terms are still used in names of some university departments, such as at the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.\nUnreasonable effectiveness.\nThe unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics is a phenomenon that was named and first made explicit by physicist Eugene Wigner. It is the fact that many mathematical theories (even the \"purest\") have applications outside their initial object. These applications may be completely outside their initial area of mathematics, and may concern physical phenomena that were completely unknown when the mathematical theory was introduced. Examples of unexpected applications of mathematical theories can be found in many areas of mathematics.\nA notable example is the prime factorization of natural numbers that was discovered more than 2,000 years before its common use for secure internet communications through the RSA cryptosystem. A second historical example is the theory of ellipses. They were studied by the ancient Greek mathematicians as conic sections (that is, intersections of cones with planes). It was almost 2,000 years later that Johannes Kepler discovered that the trajectories of the planets are ellipses.\nIn the 19th century, the internal development of geometry (pure mathematics) led to definition and study of non-Euclidean geometries, spaces of dimension higher than three and manifolds. At this time, these concepts seemed totally disconnected from the physical reality, but at the beginning of the 20th century, Albert Einstein developed the theory of relativity that uses fundamentally these concepts. In particular, spacetime of special relativity is a non-Euclidean space of dimension four, and spacetime of general relativity is a (curved) manifold of dimension four.\nA striking aspect of the interaction between mathematics and physics is when mathematics drives research in physics. This is illustrated by the discoveries of the positron and the baryon formula_5 In both cases, the equations of the theories had unexplained solutions, which led to conjecture of the existence of an unknown particle, and the search for these particles. In both cases, these particles were discovered a few years later by specific experiments.\nSpecific sciences.\nPhysics.\nMathematics and physics have influenced each other over their modern history. Modern physics uses mathematics abundantly, and is also considered to be the motivation of major mathematical developments.\nComputing.\nComputing is closely related to mathematics in several ways. Theoretical computer science is considered to be mathematical in nature. Communication technologies apply branches of mathematics that may be very old (e.g., arithmetic), especially with respect to transmission security, in cryptography and coding theory. Discrete mathematics is useful in many areas of computer science, such as complexity theory, information theory, and graph theory. In 1998, the Kepler conjecture on sphere packing seemed to also be partially proven by computer.\nBiology and chemistry.\nBiology uses probability extensively in fields such as ecology or neurobiology. Most discussion of probability centers on the concept of evolutionary fitness. Ecology heavily uses modeling to simulate population dynamics, study ecosystems such as the predator-prey model, measure pollution diffusion, or to assess climate change. The dynamics of a population can be modeled by coupled differential equations, such as the Lotka\u2013Volterra equations.\nStatistical hypothesis testing, is run on data from clinical trials to determine whether a new treatment works. Since the start of the 20th century, chemistry has used computing to model molecules in three dimensions.\nEarth sciences.\nStructural geology and climatology use probabilistic models to predict the risk of natural catastrophes. Similarly, meteorology, oceanography, and planetology also use mathematics due to their heavy use of models.\nSocial sciences.\nAreas of mathematics used in the social sciences include probability/statistics and differential equations. These are used in linguistics, economics, sociology, and psychology.\nOften the fundamental postulate of mathematical economics is that of the rational individual actor \u2013 \"Homo economicus\" (lit.\u2009'economic man'). In this model, the individual seeks to maximize their self-interest, and always makes optimal choices using perfect information. This atomistic view of economics allows it to relatively easily mathematize its thinking, because individual calculations are transposed into mathematical calculations. Such mathematical modeling allows one to probe economic mechanisms. Some reject or criticise the concept of \"Homo economicus\". Economists note that real people have limited information, make poor choices, and care about fairness and altruism, not just personal gain.\nWithout mathematical modeling, it is hard to go beyond statistical observations or untestable speculation. Mathematical modeling allows economists to create structured frameworks to test hypotheses and analyze complex interactions. Models provide clarity and precision, enabling the translation of theoretical concepts into quantifiable predictions that can be tested against real-world data.\nAt the start of the 20th century, there was a development to express historical movements in formulas. In 1922, Nikolai Kondratiev discerned the ~50-year-long Kondratiev cycle, which explains phases of economic growth or crisis. Towards the end of the 19th century, mathematicians extended their analysis into geopolitics. Peter Turchin developed cliodynamics in the 1990s.\nMathematization of the social sciences is not without risk. In the controversial book \"Fashionable Nonsense\" (1997), Sokal and Bricmont denounced the unfounded or abusive use of scientific terminology, particularly from mathematics or physics, in the social sciences. The study of complex systems (evolution of unemployment, business capital, demographic evolution of a population, etc.) uses mathematical knowledge. However, the choice of counting criteria, particularly for unemployment, or of models, can be subject to controversy.\nPhilosophy.\nReality.\nThe connection between mathematics and material reality has led to philosophical debates since at least the time of Pythagoras. The ancient philosopher Plato argued that abstractions that reflect material reality have themselves a reality that exists outside space and time. As a result, the philosophical view that mathematical objects somehow exist on their own in abstraction is often referred to as Platonism. Independently of their possible philosophical opinions, modern mathematicians may be generally considered as Platonists, since they think of and talk of their objects of study as real objects.\nArmand Borel summarized this view of mathematics reality as follows, and provided quotations of G. H. Hardy, Charles Hermite, Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Albert Einstein that support his views.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Something becomes objective (as opposed to \"subjective\") as soon as we are convinced that it exists in the minds of others in the same form as it does in ours and that we can think about it and discuss it together. Because the language of mathematics is so precise, it is ideally suited to defining concepts for which such a consensus exists. In my opinion, that is sufficient to provide us with a feeling of an objective existence, of a reality of mathematics ...\nNevertheless, Platonism and the concurrent views on abstraction do not explain the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics (as Platonism assumes mathematics exists independently, but does not explain why it matches reality).\nProposed definitions.\nThere is no general consensus about the definition of mathematics or its epistemological status\u2014that is, its place inside knowledge. A great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics, or consider it undefinable. There is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science. Some just say, \"mathematics is what mathematicians do\". A common approach is to define mathematics by its object of study.\nAristotle defined mathematics as \"the science of quantity\" and this definition prevailed until the 18th century. However, Aristotle also noted a focus on quantity alone may not distinguish mathematics from sciences like physics; in his view, abstraction and studying quantity as a property \"separable in thought\" from real instances set mathematics apart. In the 19th century, when mathematicians began to address topics\u2014such as infinite sets\u2014which have no clear-cut relation to physical reality, a variety of new definitions were given. With the large number of new areas of mathematics that have appeared since the beginning of the 20th century, defining mathematics by its object of study has become increasingly difficult. For example, in lieu of a definition, Saunders Mac Lane in \"Mathematics, form and function\" summarizes the basics of several areas of mathematics, emphasizing their inter-connectedness, and observes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the development of Mathematics provides a tightly connected network of formal rules, concepts, and systems. Nodes of this network are closely bound to procedures useful in human activities and to questions arising in science. The transition from activities to the formal Mathematical systems is guided by a variety of general insights and ideas.\nAnother approach for defining mathematics is to use its methods. For example, an area of study is often qualified as mathematics as soon as one can prove theorems\u2014assertions whose validity relies on a proof, that is, a purely logical deduction.\nRigor.\nMathematical reasoning requires rigor. This means that the definitions must be absolutely unambiguous and the proofs must be reducible to a succession of applications of inference rules, without any use of empirical evidence and intuition. Rigorous reasoning is not specific to mathematics, but, in mathematics, the standard of rigor is much higher than elsewhere. Despite mathematics' concision, rigorous proofs can require hundreds of pages to express, such as the 255-page Feit\u2013Thompson theorem. The emergence of computer-assisted proofs has allowed proof lengths to further expand. The result of this trend is a philosophy of the quasi-empiricist proof that can not be considered infallible, but has a probability attached to it.\nThe concept of rigor in mathematics dates back to ancient Greece, where their society encouraged logical, deductive reasoning. However, this rigorous approach would tend to discourage exploration of new approaches, such as irrational numbers and concepts of infinity. The method of demonstrating rigorous proof was enhanced in the sixteenth century through the use of symbolic notation. In the 18th century, social transition led to mathematicians earning their keep through teaching, which led to more careful thinking about the underlying concepts of mathematics. This produced more rigorous approaches, while transitioning from geometric methods to algebraic and then arithmetic proofs.\nAt the end of the 19th century, it appeared that the definitions of the basic concepts of mathematics were not accurate enough for avoiding paradoxes (non-Euclidean geometries and Weierstrass function) and contradictions (Russell's paradox). This was solved by the inclusion of axioms with the apodictic inference rules of mathematical theories; the re-introduction of axiomatic method pioneered by the ancient Greeks. It results that \"rigor\" is no more a relevant concept in mathematics, as a proof is either correct or erroneous, and a \"rigorous proof\" is simply a pleonasm. Where a special concept of rigor comes into play is in the socialized aspects of a proof, wherein it may be demonstrably refuted by other mathematicians. After a proof has been accepted for many years or even decades, it can then be considered as reliable.\nNevertheless, the concept of \"rigor\" may remain useful for teaching to beginners what is a mathematical proof.\nTraining and practice.\nEducation.\nMathematics has a remarkable ability to cross cultural boundaries and time periods. As a human activity, the practice of mathematics has a social side, which includes education, careers, recognition, popularization, and so on. In education, mathematics is a core part of the curriculum and forms an important element of the STEM academic disciplines. Prominent careers for professional mathematicians include mathematics teacher or professor, statistician, actuary, financial analyst, economist, accountant, commodity trader, or computer consultant.\nArchaeological evidence shows that instruction in mathematics occurred as early as the second millennium BCE in ancient Babylonia. Comparable evidence has been unearthed for scribal mathematics training in the ancient Near East and then for the Greco-Roman world starting around 300 BCE. The oldest known mathematics textbook is the Rhind papyrus, dated from c.\u20091650 BCE in Egypt. Due to a scarcity of books, mathematical teachings in ancient India were communicated using memorized oral tradition since the Vedic period (c.\u20091500\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009500 BCE). In Imperial China during the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907 CE), a mathematics curriculum was adopted for the civil service exam to join the state bureaucracy.\nFollowing the Dark Ages, mathematics education in Europe was provided by religious schools as part of the Quadrivium. Formal instruction in pedagogy began with Jesuit schools in the 16th and 17th century. Most mathematical curricula remained at a basic and practical level until the nineteenth century, when it began to flourish in France and Germany. The oldest journal addressing instruction in mathematics was \"L'Enseignement Math\u00e9matique\", which began publication in 1899. The Western advancements in science and technology led to the establishment of centralized education systems in many nation-states, with mathematics as a core component\u2014initially for its military applications. While the content of courses varies, in the present day nearly all countries teach mathematics to students for significant amounts of time.\nDuring school, mathematical capabilities and positive expectations have a strong association with career interest in the field. Extrinsic factors such as feedback motivation by teachers, parents, and peer groups can influence the level of interest in mathematics. Some students studying mathematics may develop an apprehension or fear about their performance in the subject. This is known as mathematical anxiety, and is considered the most prominent of the disorders impacting academic performance. Mathematical anxiety can develop due to various factors such as parental and teacher attitudes, social stereotypes, and personal traits. Help to counteract the anxiety can come from changes in instructional approaches, by interactions with parents and teachers, and by tailored treatments for the individual.\nPsychology (aesthetic, creativity and intuition).\nThe validity of a mathematical theorem relies only on the rigor of its proof, which could theoretically be done automatically by a computer program. This does not mean that there is no place for creativity in a mathematical work. On the contrary, many important mathematical results (theorems) are solutions of problems that other mathematicians failed to solve, and the invention of a way for solving them may be a fundamental way of the solving process. An extreme example is Apery's theorem: Roger Apery provided only the ideas for a proof, and the formal proof was given only several months later by three other mathematicians.\nCreativity and rigor are not the only psychological aspects of the activity of mathematicians. Some mathematicians can see their activity as a game, more specifically as solving puzzles. This aspect of mathematical activity is emphasized in recreational mathematics.\nMathematicians can find an aesthetic value to mathematics. Like beauty, it is hard to define, it is commonly related to \"elegance\", which involves qualities like simplicity, symmetry, completeness, and generality. G. H. Hardy in \"A Mathematician's Apology\" expressed the belief that the aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He also identified other criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, and inevitability, which contribute to mathematical aesthetics. Paul Erd\u0151s expressed this sentiment more ironically by speaking of \"The Book\", a supposed divine collection of the most beautiful proofs. The 1998 book \"Proofs from THE BOOK\", inspired by Erd\u0151s, is a collection of particularly succinct and revelatory mathematical arguments. Some examples of particularly elegant results included are Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers and the fast Fourier transform for harmonic analysis.\nSome feel that to consider mathematics a science is to downplay its artistry and history in the seven traditional liberal arts. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematical results are \"created\" (as in art) or \"discovered\" (as in science). The popularity of recreational mathematics is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions.\nCultural impact.\nArtistic expression.\nNotes that sound well together to a Western ear are sounds whose fundamental frequencies of vibration are in simple ratios. For example, an octave doubles the frequency and a perfect fifth multiplies it by formula_6.\nHumans, as well as some other animals, find symmetric patterns to be more beautiful. Mathematically, the symmetries of an object form a group known as the symmetry group. For example, the group underlying mirror symmetry is the cyclic group of two elements, formula_7. A Rorschach test is a figure invariant by this symmetry, as are butterfly and animal bodies more generally (at least on the surface). Waves on the sea surface possess translation symmetry: moving one's viewpoint by the distance between wave crests does not change one's view of the sea. Fractals possess self-similarity.\nPopularization.\nPopular mathematics is the act of presenting mathematics without technical terms. Presenting mathematics may be hard since the general public suffers from mathematical anxiety and mathematical objects are highly abstract. However, popular mathematics writing can overcome this by using applications or cultural links. Despite this, mathematics is rarely the topic of popularization in printed or televised media.\nAwards and prize problems.\nThe most prestigious award in mathematics is the Fields Medal, established by Canadian John Charles Fields in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II) to up to four individuals. It is considered the mathematical equivalent of the Nobel Prize.\nOther prestigious mathematics awards include:\nA famous list of 23 open problems, called \"Hilbert's problems\", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician David Hilbert. This list has achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least thirteen of the problems (depending how some are interpreted) have been solved.\nA new list of seven important problems, titled the \"Millennium Prize Problems\", was published in 2000. Only one of them, the Riemann hypothesis, duplicates one of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a 1 million dollar reward. To date, only one of these problems, the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, has been solved, by the Russian mathematician Grigori Perelman.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "18836", "revid": "46846351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18836", "title": "Middle Ages", "text": "European history from the 5th to 15th centuries\nIn the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted approximately from the 5th to the late 15th centuries, comparable with the post-classical period of global history. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and transitioned into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.\nPopulation decline, counterurbanisation, the collapse of centralised authority, invasions, and mass migrations of tribes, which had begun in Late antiquity (c. ~3rd\u20138th centuries) and into the Early Middle Ages (c. 5th\u201310th centuries). The large-scale movements of the Migration Period, including various Germanic peoples, formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire. In the 7th century, North Africa and the Middle East\u2014once part of the Byzantine Empire\u2014came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate, an Islamic empire, after conquest by Muhammad's successors. Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, the break with classical antiquity was incomplete. The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire, Rome's direct continuation, survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and remained a major power. The empire's law code, the \"Corpus Juris Civilis\" or \"Code of Justinian\", was rediscovered in Northern Italy in the 11th century. In the West, most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions. Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise the remaining pagans across Europe continued. The Franks, under the Carolingian dynasty, briefly established the Carolingian Empire during the later 8th and early 9th centuries. It covered much of Western Europe but later succumbed to the pressures of internal civil wars combined with external invasions: Vikings from the north, Magyars from the east, and Saracens from the south.\nDuring the High Middle Ages, which began after 1000, the population of Europe increased significantly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the Medieval Warm Period climate change allowed crop yields to increase. Manorialism, the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles, and feudalism, the political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rent from lands and manors, were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages. This period also saw the collapse of the unified Christian church with the East\u2013West Schism of 1054. The Crusades, first preached in 1095, were military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims. Kings became the heads of centralised nation-states, reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified Christendom more distant. Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism, a philosophy that emphasised joining faith to reason, and by the founding of universities. The theology of Thomas Aquinas, the paintings of Giotto, the poetry of Dante and Chaucer, the travels of Marco Polo, and the Gothic architecture of cathedrals such as Chartres are among the outstanding achievements toward the end of this period and into the Late Middle Ages.\nThe Late Middle Ages was marked by difficulties and calamities, including famine, plague, and war, which significantly diminished the population of Europe; between 1347 and 1350, the Black Death killed about a third of Europeans. Controversy, heresy, and the Western Schism within the Catholic Church paralleled the interstate conflict, civil strife, and peasant revolts that occurred in the kingdoms. Cultural and technological developments transformed European society, concluding the Late Middle Ages and beginning the early modern period.\nTerminology and periodisation.\nThe Middle Ages is one of the three major periods in the most enduring scheme for analysing European history: classical civilisation or antiquity, the Middle Ages and the modern period. The \"Middle Ages\" first appears in Latin in 1469 as \"media tempestas\" or \"middle season\". In early usage, there were many variants, including \"medium aevum\", or \"middle age\", first recorded in 1604, and \"media saecula\", or \"middle centuries\", first recorded in 1625. The adjective \"medieval\" (or sometimes \"mediaeval\" or \"medi\u00e6val\"), meaning pertaining to the Middle Ages, derives from .\nMedieval writers divided history into periods such as the \"Six Ages\" or the \"Four Empires\" and considered their time to be the last before the end of the world. When referring to their own times, they spoke of them as being \"modern\". In the 1330s, the Italian humanist and poet Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as ('ancient') and to the Christian period as ('new'). Petrarch regarded the post-Roman centuries as \"dark\" compared to the \"light\" of classical antiquity. Leonardo Bruni was the first historian to use tripartite periodisation in his \"History of the Florentine People\" (1442), with a middle period \"between the fall of the Roman Empire and the revival of city life sometime in late eleventh and twelfth centuries\". Tripartite periodisation became standard after the 17th-century German historian Christoph Cellarius divided history into three periods: ancient, medieval, and modern.\nThe most commonly given starting point for the Middle Ages is around 500, with the date of 476 first used by Bruni. Later starting dates are sometimes used in the outer parts of Europe. For Europe as a whole, 1500 is often considered to be the end of the Middle Ages, but there is no universally agreed upon end date. Depending on the context, events such as the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453, Christopher Columbus's first voyage to the Americas in 1492, or the Reformation in 1517 are sometimes used. English historians often use the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 to mark the end of the period. For Spain, dates commonly used are the death of King Ferdinand II in 1516, the death of Queen Isabella I of Castile in 1504, or the conquest of Granada in 1492.\nHistorians from Romance-speaking countries tend to divide the Middle Ages into two parts: an earlier \"High\" and later \"Low\" period. English-speaking historians, following their German counterparts, generally subdivide the Middle Ages into three intervals: \"Early\", \"High\", and \"Late\". In the 19th century, the entire Middle Ages were often referred to as the \"Dark Ages\", but with the adoption of these subdivisions, use of this term was restricted to the Early Middle Ages, at least among historians.\nLater Roman Empire.\nThe Roman Empire reached its greatest territorial extent during the 2nd century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories. Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to create the Crisis of the Third Century, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the 3rd century, mainly in response to the war with the Sasanian Empire, which revived in the middle of the 3rd century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the Roman legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.\nThe Emperor Diocletian (r. 284\u2013305) split the empire into separately administered eastern and western halves in 286; the empire was not considered divided by its inhabitants or rulers, as legal and administrative promulgations in one division were considered valid in the other. In 330, after a period of civil war, Constantine the Great (r. 306\u2013337) refounded the city of Byzantium as the newly renamed eastern capital, Constantinople. Diocletian's reforms strengthened the governmental bureaucracy, reformed taxation, and strengthened the army, which bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing: excessive taxation, a declining birthrate, and pressures on its frontiers, among others. Civil war between rival emperors became common in the middle of the 4th century, diverting soldiers from the empire's frontier forces and allowing invaders to encroach. For much of the 4th century, Roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier classical period, with a widening gulf between the rich and poor, and a decline in the vitality of the smaller towns. Another change was the Christianisation, or conversion of the empire to Christianity, a gradual process that lasted from the 2nd to the 5th centuries.\nIn 376, the Goths, fleeing from the Huns, received permission from Emperor Valens (r. 364\u2013378) to settle in the Roman province of Thracia in the Balkans. The settlement did not go smoothly, and the Goths began to raid and plunder when Roman officials mishandled the situation. Valens, attempting to put down the disorder, was killed fighting the Goths at the Battle of Adrianople on 9 August 378. In addition to the threat from such tribal confederacies in the north, internal divisions within the empire, especially within the Christian Church, caused problems. In 400, the Visigoths invaded the Western Roman Empire and, although briefly forced back from Italy, in 410 sacked the city of Rome. In 406 the Alans, Vandals, and Suevi crossed into Gaul; over the next three years they spread across Gaul and in 409 crossed the Pyrenees Mountains into modern-day Spain. The Migration Period began, when various peoples, initially largely Germanic peoples, moved across Europe. The Franks, Alemanni, and the Burgundians all ended up in northern Gaul while the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes settled in Britain, and the Vandals went on to cross the strait of Gibraltar after which they conquered the province of Africa. In the 430s the Huns began invading the empire; their king Attila (r. 434\u2013453) led invasions into the Balkans in 442 and 447, Gaul in 451, and Italy in 452. The Hunnic threat remained until Attila's death in 453, when the Hunnic confederation he led fell apart. These invasions by the tribes completely changed the political and demographic nature of what had been the Western Roman Empire.\nBy the end of the 5th century, the western section of the empire was divided into smaller political units ruled by the tribes that had invaded in the early part of the century. The deposition of the last emperor of the west, Romulus Augustulus, in 476 has traditionally marked the end of the Western Roman Empire. By 493 the Italian peninsula was conquered by the Ostrogoths. The Eastern Roman Empire, often referred to as the Byzantine Empire after the fall of its western counterpart, had little ability to assert control over the lost western territories. The Byzantine emperors maintained a claim over the territory, but while none of the new kings in the west dared to elevate himself to the position of emperor of the west, Byzantine control of most of the Western Empire could not be sustained; the reconquest of the Mediterranean periphery and the Italian Peninsula (Gothic War) in the reign of Justinian (r. 527\u2013565) was the sole, and temporary, exception.\nEarly Middle Ages.\nNew societies.\nThe political structure of Western Europe changed with the end of the united Roman Empire. Although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as \"invasions\", they were not just military expeditions but migrations of entire peoples into the empire. Such movements were aided by the refusal of the Western Roman elites to support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration. The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as Stilicho (d. 408), Aetius (d. 454), Aspar (d. 471), Ricimer (d. 472), or Gundobad (d. 516), who were partly or fully of non-Roman background. When the line of Western emperors ceased, many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background. Intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites was common. This led to a fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes, including the popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than was common in the Roman state. Material artefacts left by the Romans and the invaders are often similar, and tribal items were often modelled on Roman objects. Much of the scholarly and written culture of the new kingdoms was also based on Roman intellectual traditions. An important difference was the new polities' gradual loss of tax revenue. Many new political entities no longer supported their armies through taxes; instead, they relied on granting them land or rents. This meant there was less need for large tax revenues, so the taxation systems decayed. Warfare was common between and within the kingdoms. Slavery declined as the supply weakened, and society became more rural.\nBetween the 5th and 8th centuries, new peoples and individuals filled the political void left by the centralised Roman government. The Ostrogoths, a Gothic tribe, settled in Roman Italy in the late fifth century under Theoderic the Great (d. 526) and set up a kingdom marked by its co-operation between the Italians and the Ostrogoths, at least until the last years of Theodoric's reign. The Burgundians settled in Gaul, and after an earlier realm was destroyed by the Huns in 436, formed a new kingdom in the 440s. Between today's Geneva and Lyon, it grew to become the realm of Burgundy in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. Elsewhere in Gaul, the Franks and Celtic Britons set up small polities. Francia was centred in northern Gaul, and the first king of whom much is known is Childeric I (d. 481). His grave was discovered in 1653 and is remarkable for its grave goods, which included weapons and a large quantity of gold.\nUnder Childeric's son Clovis I (r. 509\u2013511), the founder of the Merovingian dynasty, the Frankish kingdom expanded and converted to Christianity. The Britons, related to the natives of Britannia\u00a0\u2013 modern-day Great Britain\u00a0\u2013 settled in what is now Brittany. Other monarchies were established by the Visigothic Kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula, the Suebi in northwestern Iberia, and the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa. In the sixth century, the Lombards settled in Northern Italy, replacing the Ostrogothic kingdom with a grouping of duchies that occasionally selected a king to rule over them all. By the late sixth century, this arrangement had been replaced by a permanent monarchy, the Kingdom of the Lombards.\nThe invasions brought new ethnic groups to Europe, although some regions received a larger influx of new peoples than others. In Gaul, for instance, the invaders settled much more extensively in the north-east than in the south-west. Slavs settled in Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkan Peninsula. Changes in languages accompanied the settlement of peoples. Latin, the literary language of the Western Roman Empire, was gradually replaced by vernacular languages, which evolved from Latin but were distinct from it, collectively known as Romance languages. These changes from Latin to the new languages took many centuries. Greek remained the language of the Byzantine Empire, but the migrations of the Slavs added Slavic languages to Eastern Europe.\nByzantine survival.\nAs Western Europe witnessed the formation of new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century. There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with the Sasanian Empire, Rome's traditional enemy, lasted most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and the Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in Eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort\u2014the \"Codex Theodosianus\"\u2014was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527\u2013565), another compilation took place\u2014the \"Corpus Juris Civilis\". Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, under Belisarius (d. 565). The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led to the rest of Justinian's reign concentrating on defensive measures rather than further conquests.\nAt the Emperor's death, the Byzantines had control of most of Italy, North Africa, and a small foothold in southern Spain. Historians have criticised Justinian's reconquests for overextending his realm and setting the stage for the early Muslim conquests, but many of the difficulties faced by Justinian's successors were due not just to over-taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire, which made raising troops difficult.\nIn the Eastern Empire, the Slavs' slow infiltration of the Balkans added further difficulty for Justinian's successors. It began gradually, but by the late 540s, Slavic tribes were in Thrace and Illyrium and had defeated an imperial army near Adrianople in 551. In the 560s, the Avars began to expand from their base on the north bank of the Danube; by the end of the 6th century, they were the dominant power in Central Europe and routinely able to force the Eastern emperors to pay tribute. They remained a strong power until 796.\nAn additional problem to face the empire came as a result of the involvement of Emperor Maurice (r. 582\u2013602) in Persian politics when he intervened in a succession dispute. This led to a period of peace, but when Maurice was overthrown, the Persians invaded and during the reign of Emperor Heraclius (r. 610\u2013641) controlled large chunks of the empire, including Egypt, Syria, and Anatolia until Heraclius' successful counterattack. In 628, the empire secured a peace treaty and recovered its lost territories.\nWestern society.\nIn Western Europe, some older Roman elite families died out while others became more involved with ecclesiastical than secular affairs. Values attached to Latin scholarship and education mostly disappeared, and while literacy remained important, it became a practical skill rather than a sign of elite status. In the 4th century, Jerome (d. 420) dreamed that God rebuked him for spending more time reading Cicero than the Bible. By the 6th century, Gregory of Tours (d. 594) had a similar dream, but instead of being chastised for reading Cicero, he was chastised for learning shorthand. By the late 6th century, the principal means of religious instruction in the Church had become music and art rather than the book. Most intellectual efforts went towards imitating classical scholarship, but some original works were created, along with now-lost oral compositions. The writings of Sidonius Apollinaris (d. 489), Cassiodorus (d. c.\u2009585), and Boethius (d. c. 525) were typical of the age.\nChanges also occurred among laypeople, as aristocratic culture focused on great feasts held in halls rather than on literary pursuits. Clothing for the elites was richly embellished with jewels and gold. Lords and kings supported the entourages of fighters who formed the backbone of the military forces. Family ties within the elites were important, as were the virtues of loyalty, courage, and honour. These ties led to the prevalence of feuds in aristocratic society, including those related by Gregory of Tours in Merovingian Gaul. Most feuds seem to have ended quickly with the payment of some compensation. Women took part in aristocratic society mainly in their roles as wives and mothers of men, with the role of mother of a ruler being especially prominent in Merovingian Gaul. In Anglo-Saxon society, the lack of many child rulers meant a lesser role for women as queen mothers, but this was compensated for by the increased role played by abbesses of monasteries. Only in Italy does it appear that women were always considered under the protection and control of a male relative.\nPeasant society is much less documented than the nobility. Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from archaeology; few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century. Most of the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes. Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform; some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns, but in other areas, large contiguous blocks of land were the norm. These differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies, some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having great autonomy. Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families and lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside. There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more systems. Unlike in the late Roman period, there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat, and a free peasant's family could rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord.\nRoman city life and culture changed greatly in the early Middle Ages. Although Italian cities remained inhabited, they contracted significantly in size. For instance, Rome shrank from hundreds of thousands to around 30,000 by the end of the 6th century. Roman temples were converted into Christian churches and city walls remained in use. In Northern Europe, cities also shrank, while civic monuments and other public buildings were raided for building materials. The establishment of new kingdoms often meant some growth for the towns chosen as capitals. Although there had been Jewish communities in many Roman cities, the Jews suffered periods of persecution after the conversion of the empire to Christianity. Officially, they were tolerated, if subject to conversion efforts, and were sometimes encouraged to settle in new areas.\nRise of Islam.\nReligious beliefs in the Eastern Roman Empire and Iran were in flux during the late sixth and early seventh centuries. Judaism was an active proselytising faith, and at least one Arab political leader converted to it. In addition Jewish theologians wrote polemics defending their religion against Christian and Islamic influences.\nChristianity had active missions competing with the Persians' Zoroastrianism in seeking converts, especially among residents of the Arabian Peninsula. All these strands came together with the emergence of Islam in Arabia during the lifetime of Muhammad (d. 632). After his death, Islamic forces conquered much of the Eastern Roman Empire and Persia, starting with Syria in 634\u2013635, continuing with Persia between 637 and 642, reaching Egypt in 640\u2013641, North Africa in the later seventh century, and the Iberian Peninsula in 711. By 714, Islamic forces controlled much of the peninsula in a region they called Al-Andalus.\nThe Islamic conquests reached their peak in the mid-eighth century. The defeat of Muslim forces at the Battle of Tours in 732 led to the reconquest of southern France by the Franks, but the main reason for the halt of Islamic growth in Europe was the overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate and its replacement by the Abbasid Caliphate. The Abbasids moved their capital to Baghdad and were more concerned with the Middle East than Europe, losing control of sections of the Muslim lands. Umayyad descendants took over the Iberian Peninsula, the Aghlabids controlled North Africa, and the Tulunids became rulers of Egypt. By the middle of the 8th century, new trading patterns were emerging in the Mediterranean; trade between the Franks and the Arabs replaced the old Roman economy. Franks traded timber, furs, swords, and enslaved people in return for silks and other fabrics, spices, and precious metals from the Arabs.\nTrade and economy.\nThe migrations and invasions of the 4th and 5th centuries disrupted trade networks around the Mediterranean. African goods stopped being imported into Europe, first disappearing from the interior and, by the 7th century, found only in a few cities such as Rome or Naples. By the end of the 7th century, under the impact of the Muslim conquests, African products were no longer found in Western Europe. Replacing goods from long-range trade with local products was a trend throughout the old Roman lands in the Early Middle Ages. This was especially marked in the lands that did not lie on the Mediterranean, such as northern Gaul or Britain. Non-local goods appearing in the archaeological record are usually luxury goods. In northern Europe, not only were the trade networks local, but the goods carried were simple, with little pottery or other complex products. Around the Mediterranean, pottery remained prevalent and appears to have been traded over medium-range networks, not just produced locally.\nThe various Germanic states in the west all had coinages that imitated existing Roman and Byzantine forms. Gold continued to be minted until the end of the 7th century in 693\u2013694, when it was replaced by silver in the Merovingian kingdom. The basic Frankish silver coin was the denarius or denier, while the Anglo-Saxon version was called a penny. From these areas, the denier or penny spread throughout Europe from 700 to 1000. Copper or bronze coins were not struck, nor were gold, except in Southern Europe. No silver coins denominated in multiple units were minted.\nChurch and monasticism.\nChristianity was a major unifying factor between Eastern and Western Europe before the Arab conquests, but the conquest of North Africa sundered maritime connections between those areas. Increasingly, the Byzantine Church differed in language, practices, and liturgy from the Western Church. The Eastern Church used Greek instead of Western Latin. Theological and political differences emerged, and by the early and middle 8th century, issues such as iconoclasm, clerical marriage, and state control of the Church had widened to the extent that the cultural and religious differences were more significant than the similarities. A formal break known as the East\u2013West Schism came in 1054, when the papacy and the patriarchy of Constantinople clashed over papal supremacy and excommunicated each other, which led to the division of Christianity into two Churches\u2014the Western branch became the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern branch the Eastern Orthodox Church.\nThe ecclesiastical structure of the Roman Empire survived the movements and invasions in the West mostly intact. Still, the papacy was little regarded, and few of the Western bishops looked to the bishop of Rome for religious or political leadership. Many of the popes before 750 were more concerned with Byzantine affairs and Eastern theological controversies. The register, or archived copies of the letters, of Pope Gregory the Great (pope 590\u2013604) survived. Of those 850 letters, most were concerned with affairs in Italy or Constantinople. The only part of Western Europe where the papacy had influence was Britain, where Gregory had sent the Gregorian mission in 597 to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. Irish missionaries were most active in Western Europe between the 5th and the 7th centuries, going first to England and Scotland and then on to the continent. Under such monks as Columba (d. 597) and Columbanus (d. 615), they founded monasteries, taught in Latin and Greek, and authored secular and religious works.\nThe Early Middle Ages witnessed the rise of monasticism in the West. The shape of European monasticism was determined by traditions and ideas that originated with the Desert Fathers of Egypt and Syria. Most European monasteries were of the type that focuses on the community experience of the spiritual life, called cenobitism, which was pioneered by Pachomius (d. 348) in the 4th century. Monastic ideals spread from Egypt to Western Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries through hagiographical literature such as the \"Life of Anthony\". Benedict of Nursia (d. 547) wrote the Benedictine Rule for Western monasticism during the 6th century, detailing the administrative and spiritual responsibilities of a community of monks led by an abbot. Monks and monasteries had a profound effect on the religious and political life of the Early Middle Ages, in various cases acting as land trusts for powerful families, centres of propaganda and royal support in newly conquered regions, and bases for missions and proselytisation. They were the main and sometimes only outposts of education and literacy in a region. Many of the surviving manuscripts of the Latin classics were copied in monasteries in the Early Middle Ages. Monks were also the authors of new works, including history, theology, and other subjects, written by authors such as Bede (d. 735), a native of northern England who wrote in the late 7th and early 8th centuries.\nCarolingian Europe.\nThe Frankish kingdom in northern Gaul split into kingdoms called Austrasia, Neustria, and Burgundy during the 6th and 7th centuries, all of them ruled by the Merovingian dynasty, who were descended from Clovis. The 7th century was a tumultuous period of wars between Austrasia and Neustria. Such warfare was exploited by Pippin I (d. 640), the Mayor of the Palace for Austrasia who became the power behind the Austrasian throne. Later, his family inherited the office and acted as advisers and regents. One of his descendants, Charles Martel (d. 741), won the Battle of Poitiers in 732, halting the advance of Muslim armies across the Pyrenees. Great Britain was divided into small states dominated by the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, and East Anglia which descended from the Anglo-Saxon invaders. Smaller kingdoms in present-day Wales and Scotland were still under the control of the native Britons and Picts. Ireland was divided into even smaller political units, usually known as tribal kingdoms, under the control of kings. There were perhaps as many as 150 local kings in Ireland of varying importance.\nThe Carolingian dynasty, as the successors to Charles Martel are known, officially took control of the kingdoms of Austrasia and Neustria in a coup of 753 led by Pippin III (r. 752\u2013768). A contemporary chronicle claims that Pippin sought and gained authority for this coup from Pope Stephen II (pope 752\u2013757). Pippin's takeover was reinforced with propaganda that portrayed the Merovingians as inept or cruel rulers, exalted the accomplishments of Charles Martel, and circulated stories of the family's great piety. At the time of his death in 768, Pippin left his kingdom in the hands of his two sons, Charles (r. 768\u2013814) and Carloman (r. 768\u2013771). When Carloman died of natural causes, Charles blocked the succession of Carloman's young son and installed himself as the king of the united Austrasia and Neustria. Charles, more often known as Charles the Great or Charlemagne, embarked upon a programme of systematic expansion in 774 that unified a large portion of Europe, eventually controlling modern-day France, northern Italy, and Saxony. In the wars that lasted beyond 800, he rewarded allies with war booty and command over parcels of land. In 774, Charlemagne conquered the Lombards, which freed the papacy from the fear of Lombard conquest and marked the beginnings of the Papal States.\nThe coronation of Charlemagne as emperor on Christmas Day 800 is regarded as a turning point in medieval history, marking a return of the Western Roman Empire since the new emperor ruled over much of the area previously controlled by the Western emperors. It also marks a change in Charlemagne's relationship with the Byzantine Empire, as the assumption of the imperial title by the Carolingians asserted their equivalence to the Byzantine state. There were several differences between the newly established Carolingian Empire and both the older Western Roman Empire and the concurrent Byzantine Empire. The Frankish lands were rural, with only a few small cities. Most of the people were peasants who settled on small farms. Little trade existed, and much of that was with the British Isles and Scandinavia, in contrast to the older Roman Empire with its trading networks centred on the Mediterranean. The empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor, as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called counts, who administered the counties the empire had been divided into. Clergy and local bishops served as officials, as well as the imperial officials, called \"missi dominici\", who served as roving inspectors and troubleshooters.\nCarolingian Renaissance.\nCharlemagne's court in Aachen was the centre of the cultural revival, sometimes referred to as the \"Carolingian Renaissance\". Literacy increased, as did development in the arts, architecture, jurisprudence, and liturgical and scriptural studies. The English monk Alcuin (d. 804) was invited to Aachen and brought the education available in the monasteries of Northumbria. Charlemagne's chancery\u2014or writing office\u2014made use of a new script today known as Carolingian minuscule, allowing a standard writing style that advanced communication across much of Europe. Charlemagne sponsored changes in church liturgy, imposing the Roman form of church service on his domains, as well as the Gregorian chant in liturgical music for the churches. An important activity for scholars during this period was copying, correcting, and disseminating basic works on religious and secular topics to encourage learning. New works on religious topics and schoolbooks were also produced. Grammarians of the period modified the Latin language, changing it from the Classical Latin of the Roman Empire into a more flexible form to fit the needs of the Church and government. By the reign of Charlemagne, the language had so diverged from the classical Latin that it was later called Medieval Latin.\nBreakup of the Carolingian Empire.\nCharlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs but was unable to do so as only one son, Louis the Pious (r. 814\u2013840), was still alive by 813. Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he crowned Louis as his successor. Numerous divisions of the empire marked Louis's reign of 26 years among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took East Francia, comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. Louis the German (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother. The division was disputed. Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine, while Louis the German tried to annexe all of East Francia. Louis the Pious died in 840, with the empire still in chaos.\nA three-year civil war followed his death. By the Treaty of Verdun (843), a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers was created for Lothair to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. Louis the German controlled Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France. Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost. In 987, the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands, with the crowning of Hugh Capet (r. 987\u2013996) as king. In the eastern lands, the dynasty had died out earlier, in 911, with the death of Louis the Child, and the selection of the unrelated Conrad I (r. 911\u2013918) as king.\nInvasions, migrations, and raids by external foes accompanied the break-up of the Carolingian Empire. The Atlantic and northern shores were harassed by the Vikings, who also raided the British Isles and settled there and in Iceland. In 911, the Viking chieftain Rollo (d. c. 931) received permission from the Frankish King Charles the Simple (r. 898\u2013922) to settle in what became Normandy. The eastern parts of the Frankish kingdoms, especially Germany and Italy, were under continual Magyar assault until the invader's defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955. The break-up of the Abbasid dynasty meant that the Islamic world fragmented into smaller political states, some of which began expanding into Italy and Sicily, as well as over the Pyrenees into the southern parts of the Frankish kingdoms.\nNew kingdoms and Byzantine revival.\nEfforts by local kings to fight the invaders led to the formation of new political entities. In Anglo-Saxon England, King Alfred the Great (r. 871\u2013899) came to an agreement with the Viking invaders in the late 9th century, resulting in Danish settlements in Northumbria, Mercia, and parts of East Anglia. By the middle of the 10th century, Alfred's successors had conquered Northumbria and restored English control over most of the southern part of Great Britain. In northern Britain, Kenneth MacAlpin (d. c. 860) united the Picts and the Scots into the Kingdom of Alba. In the early 10th century, the Ottonian dynasty had established itself in Germany, and was engaged in driving back the Magyars. Its efforts culminated in the coronation in 962 of Otto I (r. 936\u2013973) as Holy Roman Emperor. In 972, he secured recognition of his title by the Byzantine Empire, which he sealed with the marriage of his son Otto II (r. 967\u2013983) to Theophanu (d. 991), daughter of an earlier Byzantine Emperor Romanos II (r. 959\u2013963). By the late 10th century Italy had been drawn into the Ottonian sphere after a period of instability; Otto III (r. 996\u20131002) spent much of his later reign in the kingdom. The western Frankish kingdom was more fragmented, and although kings remained nominally in charge, much of the political power devolved to the local lords.\nMissionary efforts to Scandinavia during the 9th and 10th centuries helped strengthen the growth of kingdoms such as Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, which gained power and territory. Some kings converted to Christianity, although not all by 1000. Scandinavians also expanded and colonised throughout Europe. Besides the settlements in Ireland, England, and Normandy, further settlement took place in what became Russia and Iceland. Swedish traders and raiders ranged down the rivers of the Russian steppe and even attempted to seize Constantinople in 860 and 907. Christian Spain, initially driven into a small section of the peninsula in the north, expanded slowly south during the 9th and 10th centuries, establishing the kingdoms of Asturias and Le\u00f3n.\nIn Eastern Europe, Byzantium revived its fortunes under Emperor Basil I (r. 867\u2013886) and his successors Leo VI (r. 886\u2013912) and Constantine VII (r. 913\u2013959), members of the Macedonian dynasty. Commerce revived, and the emperors oversaw the extension of a uniform administration to all the provinces. The military was reorganised, which allowed the emperors John I (r. 969\u2013976) and Basil II (r. 976\u20131025) to expand the frontiers of the empire on all fronts. The imperial court was the centre of a revival of classical learning, a process known as the Macedonian Renaissance. Writers such as John Geometres (fl. early 10th century) composed new hymns, poems, and other works. Missionary efforts by both Eastern and Western clergy resulted in the conversion of the Moravians, Bulgars, Bohemians, Poles, Magyars, and Slavic inhabitants of the Kievan Rus'. These conversions contributed to the founding of political states in the lands of those peoples\u2014the states of Moravia, Bulgaria, Bohemia, Poland, Hungary, and the Kievan Rus'. Bulgaria, which was founded around 680, at its height reached from Budapest to the Black Sea and from the Dnieper River in modern Ukraine to the Adriatic Sea. By 1018, the last Bulgarian nobles had surrendered to the Byzantine Empire.\nArt and architecture.\nFew large stone buildings were constructed between the Constantinian basilicas of the 4th and 8th centuries, although many smaller ones were built during the 6th and 7th centuries. By the beginning of the 8th century, the Carolingian Empire revived the basilica form of architecture. One feature of the basilica is the use of a transept, or the \"arms\" of a cross-shaped building that are perpendicular to the long nave. Other new features of religious architecture include the crossing tower and a monumental entrance to the church, usually at the west end of the building.\nCarolingian art was produced for a small group of figures around the court and the monasteries and churches they supported. It was dominated by efforts to regain the dignity and classicism of imperial Roman and Byzantine art but was also influenced by the Insular art of the British Isles. Insular art integrated the energy of Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon Germanic styles of ornament with Mediterranean forms such as the book, and established many characteristics of art for the rest of the medieval period. Surviving religious works from the Early Middle Ages are mostly illuminated manuscripts and carved ivories, originally made for metalwork that has since been melted down. Objects in precious metals were the most prestigious form of art, but almost all are lost except for a few crosses such as the Cross of Lothair, several reliquaries, and finds such as the Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo and the hoards of Gourdon from Merovingian France, Guarrazar from Visigothic Spain and Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s near Byzantine territory. There are survivals from the large brooches in fibula or penannular form that were key pieces of personal adornment for elites, including the Irish Tara Brooch. Highly decorated books were mostly Gospel Books and these have survived in larger numbers, including the Insular Book of Kells, the Book of Lindisfarne, and the imperial Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram, which is one of the few to retain its \"treasure binding\" of gold encrusted with jewels. Charlemagne's court seems to have been responsible for the acceptance of figurative monumental sculpture in Christian art, and by the end of the period near life-sized figures such as the Gero Cross were common in important churches.\nMilitary and technological developments.\nDuring the later Roman Empire, the principal military developments were attempts to create an effective cavalry force and the continued development of highly specialised types of troops. The creation of heavily armoured cataphract-type soldiers as cavalry was an important feature of the 5th-century Roman military. The various invading tribes had differing emphases on types of soldiers\u2014ranging from the primarily infantry Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain to the Vandals and Visigoths, who had a high proportion of cavalry in their armies. During the early invasion period, the stirrup had not been introduced into warfare, which limited the usefulness of cavalry as shock troops because it was not possible to put the full force of the horse and rider behind blows struck by the rider. The greatest change in military affairs during the invasion period was the adoption of the Hunnic composite bow in place of the earlier, and weaker, Scythian composite bow. Another development was the increasing use of longswords and the progressive replacement of scale armour by mail armour and lamellar armour.\nThe importance of infantry and light cavalry declined during the early Carolingian period, with a growing dominance of elite heavy cavalry. The use of militia-type levies of the free population declined over the Carolingian period. Although much of the Carolingian armies were mounted, a large proportion during the early period appear to have been mounted infantry, rather than true cavalry. One exception was Anglo-Saxon England, where the armies were still composed of regional levies, known as the \"fyrd\", which were led by the local elites. In military technology, one of the main changes was the return of the crossbow, which had been known in Roman times and reappeared as a military weapon during the last part of the Early Middle Ages. Another change was the introduction of the stirrup, which increased the effectiveness of cavalry as shock troops. A technological advance that had implications beyond the military was the horseshoe, which allowed horses to be used in rocky terrain.\nHigh Middle Ages.\nSociety and economic life.\nPeasantry.\nThe High Middle Ages was a period of tremendous population expansion. The estimated population of Europe grew from 35 to 80\u00a0million between 1000 and 1347, although the exact causes remain unclear: improved agricultural techniques, the decline of slaveholding, a more clement climate and the lack of invasion have all been suggested. As much as 90\u00a0per cent of the European population remained rural peasants. Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities, usually known as manors or villages. These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services in a system known as manorialism. There remained a few free peasants throughout this period and beyond, with more of them in the regions of Southern Europe than in the north. The practice of assarting, or bringing new lands into production by offering incentives to the peasants who settled them, also contributed to population expansion.\nThe open-field system of agriculture was commonly practised in most of Europe, especially in \"northwestern and central Europe\". Such agricultural communities had three essential characteristics: individual peasant holdings in the form of strips of land were scattered among the different fields belonging to the manor; crops were rotated from year to year to preserve soil fertility; and common land was used for grazing livestock and other purposes. Some regions used a three-field system of crop rotation; others retained the older two-field system.\nNobility, clergy, and townspeople.\nOther sections of society included the nobility, clergy, and townspeople. Nobles, both the titled nobility and simple knights, exploited the manors and the peasants. However, they did not own lands outright but were granted rights to the income from a manor or other lands by an overlord through the system of feudalism. During the 11th and 12th centuries, these lands, or fiefs, came to be considered hereditary. In most areas, they were no longer divisible between all the heirs, as had been the case in the early medieval period. Instead, most fiefs and lands went to the eldest son. The dominance of the nobility was built upon its control of the land, its military service as heavy cavalry, control of castles, and various immunities from taxes or other impositions. Castles, initially in wood but later in stone, began to be constructed in the 9th and 10th centuries in response to the disorder of the time, and protected from invaders and allowing lords defence from rivals. Control of castles allowed the nobles to defy kings or other overlords. Nobles were stratified; kings and the highest-ranking nobility controlled large numbers of commoners and large tracts of land, as well as other nobles. Beneath them, lesser nobles had authority over smaller land areas and fewer people. Knights were the lowest level of nobility; they controlled but did not own land and had to serve other nobles.\nThe clergy was divided into two types: the secular clergy, who lived out in the world, and the regular clergy, who lived isolated under a religious rule and usually consisted of monks. Throughout the period, monks remained a tiny proportion of the population, usually less than one percent. Most of the regular clergy were drawn from the nobility, the same social class that served as the recruiting ground for the upper levels of the secular clergy. The local parish priests were often drawn from the peasant class. Townspeople were somewhat unusual, as they did not fit into the traditional three-fold division of society into nobles, clergy, and peasants. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the ranks of the townspeople expanded greatly as existing towns grew and new population centres were founded. But throughout the Middle Ages, the population of the towns probably never exceeded 10 percent of the total population.\nReligious groups.\nJews also spread across Europe during the period. Communities were established in Germany and England in the 11th and 12th centuries, but Spanish Jews, long settled in Spain under the Muslims, came under Christian rule and increasing pressure to convert to Christianity. Most Jews were confined to the cities, as they were not allowed to own land or be peasants. Besides the Jews, there were other non-Christians on the edges of Europe\u2014pagan Slavs in Eastern Europe and Muslims in Southern Europe.\nWomen.\nWomen in the Middle Ages were officially required to be subordinate to some male, whether their father, husband, or other kinsman. Widows were often allowed much control over their lives, but they were still restricted legally. Women's work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks. Peasant women were usually responsible for caring for the household, child care, gardening, and animal husbandry near the house. They could supplement their household income by spinning or brewing at home. At harvest time, they were also expected to help with fieldwork. Townswomen, like peasant women, were responsible for the household and could also engage in trade. The trades that were open to women varied by country and period. Noblewomen were responsible for running a household and could occasionally be expected to handle estates in the absence of male relatives, but they were usually restricted from participation in military or government affairs. The only role open to women in the Church was that of nuns, as they could not become priests.\nIn central and northern Italy and in Flanders, the rise of towns that were, to a degree, self-governing stimulated economic growth and created an environment for new types of trade associations. Commercial cities on the shores of the Baltic entered into agreements known as the Hanseatic League. The Italian Maritime republics such as Venice, Genoa, and Pisa expanded their trade throughout the Mediterranean. Great trading fairs were established and flourished in northern France during the period, allowing Italian and German merchants to trade with each other as well as local merchants. In the late 13th century new land and sea routes to the Far East were pioneered, famously described in \"The Travels of Marco Polo\" written by one of the traders, Marco Polo (d. 1324). Besides new trading opportunities, agricultural and technological improvements increased crop yields, which allowed the trade networks to expand. Rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money, and gold coinage was again minted in Europe, first in Italy and later in France and other countries. New forms of commercial contracts emerged, sharing risk among merchants. Accounting methods improved, partly through the use of double-entry bookkeeping; letters of credit also appeared, allowing easy transmission of money.\nRise of state power.\nThe High Middle Ages was the formative period in the history of the modern Western state. Kings in France, England, and Spain consolidated their power and established lasting governing institutions. New kingdoms such as Hungary and Poland, after their conversion to Christianity, became Central European powers. The Magyars settled Hungary around 900 under King \u00c1rp\u00e1d (d. c. 907) after a series of invasions in the 9th century. The papacy, long attached to an ideology of independence from secular kings, first asserted its claim to temporal authority over the entire Christian world; the Papal Monarchy reached its apogee in the early 13th century under the pontificate of Innocent III (pope 1198\u20131216). Northern Crusades and the advance of Christian kingdoms and military orders into previously pagan regions in the Baltic and Finnic north-east brought the forced assimilation of numerous native peoples into European culture.\nDuring the early High Middle Ages, Germany was ruled by the Ottonian dynasty, which struggled to control the powerful dukes ruling over territorial duchies, tracing back to the Migration period. In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084\u20131105) over Church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111\u20131125), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155\u20131190) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors struggled into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220\u20131250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars, and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century. Mongols first shattered the Kyivan Rus' principalities and then invaded Eastern Europe in 1241, 1259, and 1287.\nUnder the Capetian dynasty the French monarchy slowly began to expand its authority over the nobility, growing out of the \u00cele-de-France to exert control over more of the country in the 11th and 12th centuries. They faced a powerful rival in the Dukes of Normandy, who in 1066 under William the Conqueror (duke 1035\u20131087), conquered England (r. 1066\u20131087) and created a cross-channel empire that lasted, in various forms, throughout the rest of the Middle Ages. Normans also settled in Sicily and southern Italy, when Robert Guiscard (d. 1085) landed there in 1059 and established a duchy that later became the Kingdom of Sicily. Under the Angevin dynasty of Henry II (r. 1154\u20131189) and his son Richard I (r. 1189\u20131199), the kings of England ruled over England and large areas of France, brought to the family by Henry II's marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine (d. 1204), heiress to much of southern France. Richard's younger brother John (r. 1199\u20131216) lost Normandy and the rest of the northern French possessions in 1204 to the French King Philip II Augustus (r. 1180\u20131223). This led to dissension among the English nobility. John's financial exactions to pay for his unsuccessful attempts to regain Normandy led in 1215 to \"Magna Carta\", a charter that confirmed the rights and privileges of free men in England. Under Henry III (r. 1216\u20131272), John's son, further concessions were made to the nobility, and royal power was diminished. The French monarchy continued to make gains against the nobility during the late 12th and 13th centuries, bringing more territories within the kingdom under the king's personal rule and centralising the royal administration. Under Louis IX (r. 1226\u20131270), royal prestige rose to new heights as Louis served as a mediator for most of Europe.\nIn Iberia, the Christian states, which had been confined to the north-western part of the peninsula, began to push back against the Islamic states in the south, a period known as the \"Reconquista\". By about 1150, the Christian north had coalesced into the five major kingdoms of Le\u00f3n, Castile, Aragon, Navarre, and Portugal. Southern Iberia remained under control of Islamic states, initially under the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, which broke up in 1031 into a shifting number of petty states known as \"taifas\", who fought with the Christians until the Almohad Caliphate re-established centralised rule over Southern Iberia in the 1170s. Christian forces advanced again in the early 13th century, culminating in the capture of Seville in 1248.\nCrusades.\nIn the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks took over much of the Middle East, occupying Persia during the 1040s, Armenia in the 1060s, and Jerusalem in 1070. In 1071, the Turkish army defeated the Byzantine army at the Battle of Manzikert and captured the Byzantine Emperor Romanus IV (r. 1068\u20131071). The Turks were then free to invade Asia Minor, which dealt a dangerous blow to the Byzantine Empire by seizing a large part of its population and its economic heartland. Although the Byzantines regrouped and recovered somewhat, they never fully regained Asia Minor and were often on the defensive. The Turks also had difficulties, losing control of Jerusalem to the Fatimids of Egypt and suffering from a series of internal civil wars. The Byzantines also faced a revived Bulgaria, which in the late 12th and 13th centuries spread throughout the Balkans.\nThe Crusades were intended to seize Jerusalem from Muslim control. The First Crusade was proclaimed by Pope Urban II (pope 1088\u20131099) at the Council of Clermont in 1095 in response to a request from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081\u20131118) for aid against further Muslim advances. Urban promised indulgence to anyone who took part. Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099. One feature of the crusades was the pogroms against local Jews that often took place as the crusaders left their countries for the East. These were especially brutal during the First Crusade, when the Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, and Worms were destroyed, as well as other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and the Rhine. Another outgrowth of the crusades was the foundation of a new type of monastic order, the military orders of the Templars and Hospitallers, which fused monastic life with military service.\nThe Crusaders consolidated their conquests into Crusader states. During the 12th and 13th centuries, there were a series of conflicts between them and the surrounding Islamic states. Appeals from the crusader states to the papacy led to further crusades, such as the Third Crusade, called to try to regain Jerusalem, which had been captured by Saladin (d. 1193) in 1187. In 1203, the Fourth Crusade was diverted from the Holy Land to Constantinople, and captured the city in 1204, setting up a Latin Empire of Constantinople and greatly weakening the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantines recaptured the city in 1261 but never regained their former strength. By 1291, all the crusader states had been captured or forced from the mainland. However, a titular Kingdom of Jerusalem survived on the island of Cyprus for several years afterwards.\nPopes called for crusades elsewhere besides the Holy Land: in Spain, southern France, and along the Baltic. The Spanish crusades became fused with the \"Reconquista\" of Spain from the Muslims. Although the Templars and Hospitallers took part in the Spanish crusades, similar Spanish military religious orders were founded, most of which had become part of the two main orders of Calatrava and Santiago by the beginning of the 12th century. Northern Europe also remained outside Christian influence until the 11th century or later and became a crusading venue as part of the Northern Crusades of the 12th to 14th centuries. These crusades also spawned a military order, the Order of the Sword Brothers. Another order, the Teutonic Knights, although founded in the crusader states, focused much of its activity in the Baltic after 1225 and, in 1309, moved its headquarters to Marienburg in Prussia.\nIntellectual life.\nDuring the 11th century, developments in philosophy and theology led to increased intellectual activity. There was a debate between the realists and the nominalists over the concept of \"universals\". Philosophical discourse was stimulated by the rediscovery of Aristotle and his emphasis on empiricism and rationalism. Scholars such as Peter Abelard (d. 1142) and Peter Lombard (d. 1164) introduced Aristotelian logic into theology. In the late 11th and early 12th centuries cathedral schools spread throughout Western Europe, signalling the shift of learning from monasteries to cathedrals and towns. Cathedral schools were in turn replaced by the universities established in major European cities. Philosophy and theology fused in scholasticism, an attempt by 12th- and 13th-century scholars to reconcile authoritative texts, most notably Aristotle and the Bible. This movement tried to employ a systemic approach to truth and reason and culminated in the thought of Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274), who wrote the \"Summa Theologica\", or \"Summary of Theology\".\nChivalry and the ethos of courtly love developed in royal and noble courts. This culture was expressed in the vernacular languages rather than Latin and comprised poems, stories, legends, and popular songs spread by troubadours or Minnes\u00e4ngers, or wandering minstrels. Often the stories were written down in the \"chansons de geste\", or \"songs of great deeds\", such as \"The Song of Roland\" or \"The Song of Hildebrand\". Secular and religious histories were also produced. Geoffrey of Monmouth (d. c. 1155) composed his \"Historia Regum Britanniae\", a collection of stories and legends about Arthur. Other works were more clearly history, such as Otto von Freising's (d. 1158) \"Gesta Friderici Imperatoris\" detailing the deeds of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, or William of Malmesbury's (d. c. 1143) \"Gesta Regum\" on the kings of England.\nLegal studies advanced during the 12th century. Both secular law and canon law, or ecclesiastical law, were studied in the High Middle Ages. Secular law, or Roman law, was significantly advanced by the discovery of the \"Corpus Juris Civilis\" in the 11th century, and by 1100, Roman law was being taught at Bologna. This led to the recording and standardisation of legal codes throughout Western Europe. Canon law was also studied, and around 1140, a monk named Gratian (fl. 12th century), a teacher at Bologna, wrote what became the standard text of canon law\u2014the \"Decretum\".\nAmong the results of the Greek and Islamic influence on this period in European history was the replacement of Roman numerals with the decimal positional number system and the invention of algebra, which allowed more advanced mathematics. Astronomy advanced following the translation of Ptolemy's \"Almagest\" from Greek into Latin in the late 12th century. Medicine was also studied, especially in southern Italy, where Islamic medicine influenced the school at Salerno.\nTechnology and military.\nIn the 12th and 13th centuries, Europe experienced economic growth and innovations in methods of production. Significant technological advances included the invention of the windmill, the first mechanical clocks, the manufacture of distilled spirits, and the use of the astrolabe. Concave spectacles were invented around 1286 by an unknown Italian artisan, probably working in or near Pisa.\nThe development of a three-field rotation system for planting crops increased the usage of land from one-half in use each year under the old two-field system to two-thirds under the new system, with a consequent increase in production. The development of the heavy plough allowed heavier soils to be farmed more efficiently, aided by the spread of the horse collar, which led to the use of draught horses in place of oxen. Horses are faster than oxen and require less pasture, factors that aided the implementation of the three-field system. Legumes \u2013 such as peas, beans, or lentils \u2013 were grown more widely as crops, in addition to the usual cereal crops of wheat, oats, barley, and rye.\nThe construction of cathedrals and castles advanced building technology, developing large stone buildings. Ancillary structures included new town halls, houses, bridges, and tithe barns. Shipbuilding improved with the use of the rib and plank method rather than the old Roman system of mortise and tenon. Other improvements to ships included the use of lateen sails and the stern-post rudder, both of which increased the speed at which ships could be sailed.\nIn military affairs, the use of infantry with specialised roles increased. Along with the still-dominant heavy cavalry, armies often included mounted and infantry crossbowmen, as well as sappers and engineers. Crossbows, which had been known in Late Antiquity, increased in use partly because of the increase in siege warfare in the 10th and 11th centuries. The increasing use of crossbows during the 12th and 13th centuries led to the use of closed-face helmets, heavy body armour, as well as horse armour. Gunpowder was known in Europe by the mid-13th century with a recorded use in European warfare by the English against the Scots in 1304. However, it was merely used as an explosive and not as a weapon. Cannon were being used for sieges in the 1320s, and hand-held guns were in use by the 1360s.\nArchitecture, art, and music.\nIn the 10th century, the establishment of churches and monasteries led to the development of stone architecture that elaborated vernacular Roman forms, from which the term \"Romanesque\" was derived. Where available, Roman brick and stone buildings were recycled for their materials. From the tentative beginnings known as the First Romanesque, the style flourished and spread across Europe in a remarkably homogeneous form. Just before 1000, a great wave of stone churches were being built all over Europe. Romanesque buildings have massive stone walls, openings topped by semi-circular arches, small windows, and, particularly in France, arched stone vaults. The large portal with coloured sculpture in high relief became a central feature of fa\u00e7ades, especially in France, and the capitals of columns were often carved with narrative scenes of imaginative monsters and animals. According to art historian C. R. Dodwell, \"virtually all the churches in the West were decorated with wall-paintings\", of which few survive. Simultaneous with the development in church architecture, the distinctive European form of the castle was developed and became crucial to politics and warfare.\nRomanesque art, especially metalwork, was at its most sophisticated in Mosan art, in which distinct artistic personalities, including Nicholas of Verdun (d. 1205), become apparent. An almost classical style is seen in works such as a font at Li\u00e8ge, contrasting with the writhing animals of the exactly contemporary Gloucester Candlestick. Large illuminated bibles and psalters were the typical forms of luxury manuscripts, and wall-painting flourished in churches, often following a scheme with a \"Last Judgement\" on the west wall, a Christ in Majesty at the east end, and narrative biblical scenes down the nave, or in the best surviving example, at Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe, on the barrel-vaulted roof.\nFrom the early 12th century, French builders developed the Gothic style, marked by the use of rib vaults, pointed arches, flying buttresses, and large stained glass windows. It was used mainly in churches and cathedrals and continued until the 16th century in much of Europe. Classic examples of Gothic architecture include Chartres Cathedral and Reims Cathedral in France, as well as Salisbury Cathedral in England. Stained glass became a crucial element in the design of churches, which continued to use extensive wall-paintings, now almost all lost.\nDuring this period, the practice of manuscript illumination gradually passed from monasteries to lay workshops, so that according to Janetta Benton \"by 1300 most monks bought their books in shops\", and the book of hours developed as a form of devotional book for lay-people. Metalwork remained the most prestigious art form, with Limoges enamel a popular and relatively affordable option for objects such as reliquaries and crosses. In Italy the innovations of Cimabue and Duccio, followed by the Trecento master Giotto (d. 1337), greatly increased the sophistication and status of panel painting and fresco. Increasing prosperity during the 12th century resulted in greater production of secular art; many carved ivory objects such as gaming-pieces, combs, and small religious figures have survived.\nChurch life.\nMonastic reform became an important issue during the 11th century, as elites began to worry that monks were not adhering to the rules binding them to a strictly religious life. Cluny Abbey, founded in the M\u00e2con region of France in 909, was established as part of the Cluniac Reforms, a larger movement of monastic reform in response to this fear. Cluny quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigour. It sought to maintain a high quality of spiritual life by placing itself under the protection of the papacy and by electing its own abbot without interference from laymen, thus maintaining economic and political independence from local lords.\nMonastic reform inspired change in the secular Church. The ideals upon which it was based were brought to the papacy by Pope Leo IX (pope 1049\u20131054) and provided the ideology of clerical independence that led to the Investiture Controversy in the late 11th century. This involved Pope Gregory VII (pope 1073\u20131085) and Emperor Henry IV, who initially clashed over episcopal appointments, a dispute that turned into a battle over the ideas of investiture, clerical marriage, and simony. The emperor saw the protection of the Church as one of his responsibilities and wanted to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands. Still, the papacy insisted on the Church's independence from secular lords. These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122, known as the Concordat of Worms. The dispute represents a significant stage in creating a papal monarchy separate from and equal to lay authorities. It also had the permanent consequence of empowering German princes at the expense of the German emperors.\nThe High Middle Ages was a period of great religious movements. Besides the Crusades and monastic reforms, people sought to participate in new forms of religious life. New monastic orders were founded, including the Carthusians and the Cistercians. The latter, in particular, expanded rapidly in their early years under the guidance of Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153). These new orders were formed in response to the feeling of the laity that Benedictine monasticism no longer met the needs of the laymen, who, along with those wishing to enter the religious life, wanted a return to the simpler hermetical monasticism of early Christianity, or to live an Apostolic life. Religious pilgrimages were also encouraged. Old pilgrimage sites such as Rome, Jerusalem, and Compostela received increasing numbers of visitors, and new sites such as Monte Gargano and Bari rose to prominence.\nIn the 13th century mendicant orders\u2014the Franciscans and the Dominicans\u2014who swore vows of poverty and earned their living by begging, were approved by the papacy. Religious groups such as the Waldensians and the Humiliati also attempted to return to the life of early Christianity in the middle 12th and early 13th centuries, another heretical movement condemned by the papacy. Others joined the Cathars, another movement condemned as heretical by the papacy. In 1209, a crusade was preached against the Cathars, the Albigensian Crusade, which, in combination with the medieval Inquisition, eliminated them.\nLate Middle Ages.\nWar, famine, and plague.\nThe first years of the 14th century were marked by famines, culminating in the Great Famine of 1315\u20131317. The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age, which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures. The years 1313\u20131314 and 1317\u20131321 were excessively rainy throughout Europe, resulting in widespread crop failures. The climate change\u2014which resulted in a declining average annual temperature for Europe during the 14th century\u2014was accompanied by an economic downturn.\nThese troubles were followed in 1347 by the Black Death, a pandemic that spread throughout Europe during the following three years. The death toll was probably about 35\u00a0million people in Europe, about one-third of the population. Towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions. Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited, and in some places fields were left unworked. Wages rose as landlords sought to entice fewer available workers to their fields. Further problems were lower rents and lower demand for food, which cut into agricultural income. Urban workers also felt they had a right to greater earnings, and popular uprisings broke out across Europe. Among the uprisings were the \"jacquerie\" in France, the Peasants' Revolt in England, and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders. The trauma of the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe, manifested by the foundation of new charities, the self-mortification of the flagellants, and the scapegoating of Jews. Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague throughout the rest of the 14th century; it continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages.\nSociety and economy.\nSociety throughout Europe was disturbed by the dislocations caused by the Black Death. Lands that had been marginally productive were abandoned as the survivors could acquire more fertile areas. Although serfdom declined in Western Europe, it became more common in Eastern Europe, as landlords imposed it on those of their tenants who had previously been free. Most peasants in Western Europe changed the work they had previously owed to their landlords into cash rents. The percentage of serfs among the peasantry declined from a high of 90 to closer to 50 percent by the end of the period. Landlords also became more conscious of common interests with other landholders and joined to extort their governments' privileges. Partly at the urging of landlords, governments attempted to legislate a return to the economic conditions that existed before the Black Death. Non-clergy became increasingly literate, and urban populations began to imitate the nobility's interest in chivalry.\nJewish communities were expelled from England in 1290 and from France in 1306. Although some were allowed back into France, most were not. Many Jews emigrated eastwards, and Hungary. The Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, and dispersed to Turkey, France, Italy, and Holland. The rise of banking in Italy during the 13th century continued throughout the 14th century, fuelled partly by the increasing warfare of the period and the needs of the papacy to move money between kingdoms. Many banking firms loaned money to royalty at great risk, as some were bankrupted when kings defaulted on their loans.\nState resurgence.\nStrong, royalty-based nation states rose throughout Europe in the Late Middle Ages, particularly in England, France, and the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula: Aragon, Castile, and Portugal. The long conflicts of the period strengthened royal control over their kingdoms and were extremely hard on the peasantry. Kings profited from warfare that extended royal legislation and increased the lands they directly controlled. Paying for the wars required that methods of taxation become more effective and efficient, and the rate of taxation often increased. The requirement to obtain the consent of taxpayers allowed representative bodies such as the English Parliament and the French Estates General to gain power and authority.\nThroughout the 14th century, French kings sought to expand their influence at the expense of the territorial holdings of the nobility. They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France, leading to the Hundred Years' War, waged from 1337 to 1453. Early in the war the English under Edward III (r. 1327\u20131377) and his son Edward, the Black Prince (d. 1376), won the battles of Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers, captured the city of Calais, and won control of much of France. The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war. In the early 15th century, France again came close to dissolving, but in the late 1420s, the military successes of Joan of Arc (d. 1431) led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453. The price was high, as the population of France at the end of the Wars was likely half what it had been at the start of the conflict. Conversely, the Wars positively affected English national identity, doing much to fuse the various local identities into a national English ideal. The conflict with France also helped create a national culture in England separate from French culture, which had previously been the dominant influence. The dominance of the English longbow began during early stages of the Hundred Years' War, and cannon appeared on the battlefield at Cr\u00e9cy in 1346.\nIn modern-day Germany, the Holy Roman Empire continued to rule, but the elective nature of the imperial crown meant there was no enduring dynasty around which a strong state could form. Further east, the kingdoms of Poland, Hungary, and Bohemia grew powerful. In Iberia, the Christian kingdoms continued to gain land from the Muslim kingdoms of the peninsula; Portugal concentrated on expanding overseas during the 15th century, while the other kingdoms were riven by difficulties over royal succession and other concerns. After losing the Hundred Years' War, England went on to suffer a long civil war known as the Wars of the Roses, which lasted into the 1490s and only ended when Henry Tudor (r. 1485\u20131509 as Henry VII) became king and consolidated power with his victory over Richard III (r. 1483\u20131485) at Bosworth in 1485. In Scandinavia, Margaret I of Denmark (r. in Denmark 1387\u20131412) consolidated Norway, Denmark, and Sweden in the Union of Kalmar, which continued until 1523. The major power around the Baltic Sea was the Hanseatic League, a commercial confederation of city-states that traded from Western Europe to Russia. Scotland emerged from English domination under Robert the Bruce (r. 1306\u20131329), who secured papal recognition of his kingship in 1328.\nCollapse of Byzantium.\nAlthough the Palaeologi emperors recaptured Constantinople from the Western Europeans in 1261, they could never regain control of much of the former imperial lands. They usually controlled only a small section of the Balkan Peninsula near Constantinople, the city itself, and some coastal lands on the Black Sea and around the Aegean Sea. The former Byzantine lands in the Balkans were divided between the new Kingdom of Serbia, the Second Bulgarian Empire, and the city-state of Venice. A new Turkish tribe threatened the power of the Byzantine emperors, the Ottomans, who established themselves in Anatolia in the 13th century and steadily expanded throughout the 14th century. The Ottomans expanded into Europe, reducing Bulgaria to a vassal state by 1366 and taking over Serbia after its defeat at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Western Europeans rallied to the plight of the Christians in the Balkans and declared a new crusade in 1396; a great army was sent to the Balkans, where it was defeated at the Battle of Nicopolis. Constantinople was finally captured by the Ottomans in 1453.\nControversy within the Church.\nDuring the tumultuous 14th century, disputes within the leadership of the Church led to the Avignon Papacy of 1309\u20131376, also called the \"Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy\" (a reference to the Babylonian captivity of the Jews), and then to the Great Schism, lasting from 1378 to 1418, when there were two and later three rival popes, each supported by several states. Ecclesiastical officials convened at the Council of Constance in 1414, and in the following year the council deposed one of the rival popes leaving only two claimants. Further depositions followed, and in November 1417, the council elected Martin V (pope 1417\u20131431) as pope.\nBesides the schism, the Western Church was riven by theological controversies, some of which became heresies. John Wycliffe (d. 1384), an English theologian, was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for teaching that the laity should have access to the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the Eucharist that were contrary to Church doctrine. Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: Lollardy in England and Hussitism in Bohemia. The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance. The Hussite Church, although the target of a crusade, survived beyond the Middle Ages. Other heresies were manufactured, such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312, and the division of their great wealth between the French King Philip IV (r. 1285\u20131314) and the Hospitallers.\nThe papacy further refined the practice in the Mass in the Late Middle Ages, holding that the clergy alone was allowed to partake of the wine in the Eucharist. This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy. The laity continued the practices of pilgrimages, veneration of relics, and belief in the power of the Devil. Mystics such as Meister Eckhart (d. 1327) and Thomas \u00e0 Kempis (d. 1471) wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life, which laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Besides mysticism, belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread. By the late 15th century, the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the \"Malleus Maleficarum\", the most popular handbook for witch-hunters.\nScholars, intellectuals, and exploration.\nDuring the Later Middle Ages, theologians such as John Duns Scotus (d. 1308) and William of Ockham (d. c. 1348) led a reaction against intellectualist scholasticism, objecting to the application of reason to faith. Their efforts undermined the prevailing Platonic idea of universals. Ockham's insistence that reason operates independently of faith allowed science to be separated from theology and philosophy. Legal studies were marked by the steady advance of Roman law into areas of jurisprudence previously governed by customary law. England was the lone exception to this trend, where the common law remained pre-eminent. Other countries codified their laws; legal codes were promulgated in Castile, Poland, and Lithuania.\nEducation remained mostly focused on the training of future clergy. The basic learning of the letters and numbers remained the province of the family or a village priest, but the secondary subjects of the trivium\u2014grammar, rhetoric, logic\u2014were studied in cathedral schools or schools provided by cities. Commercial secondary schools spread, and some Italian towns had more than one such enterprise. Universities also spread throughout Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries. Lay literacy rates rose but were still low; one estimate gave a literacy rate of 10 percent of males and 1 percent of females in 1500.\nThe publication of vernacular literature increased, with Dante (d. 1321), Petrarch (d. 1374) and Giovanni Boccaccio (d. 1375) in 14th-century Italy, Geoffrey Chaucer (d. 1400) and William Langland (d. c. 1386) in England, and Fran\u00e7ois Villon (d. 1464) and Christine de Pizan (d. c. 1430) in France. Much literature remained religious, and although a great deal of it continued to be written in Latin, a new demand developed for saints' lives and other devotional tracts in the vernacular languages. This was fed by the growth of the \"Devotio Moderna\" movement, most prominently in the formation of the Brethren of the Common Life, but also in the works of German mystics such as Meister Eckhart and Johannes Tauler (d. 1361). Theatre also developed in the guise of miracle plays put on by the Church. At the end of the period, the development of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in about 1450 led to the establishment of publishing houses throughout Europe by 1500.\nIn the early 15th century, the countries of the Iberian Peninsula began to sponsor exploration beyond the boundaries of Europe. Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal (d. 1460) sent expeditions that discovered the Canary Islands, the Azores, and Cape Verde during his lifetime. After his death, exploration continued; Bartolomeu Dias (d. 1500) went around the Cape of Good Hope in 1486, and Vasco da Gama (d. 1524) sailed around Africa to India in 1498. The combined Spanish monarchies of Castile and Aragon sponsored the voyage of exploration by Christopher Columbus (d. 1506) in 1492 that discovered the Americas. The English crown under Henry VII sponsored the voyage of John Cabot (d. 1498) in 1497, which landed on Cape Breton Island.\nTechnological and military developments.\nOne of the major developments in the military sphere during the Late Middle Ages was the increased use of infantry and light cavalry. The English also employed longbowmen, but other countries were unable to create similar forces with the same success. Armour continued to advance, spurred by the increasing power of crossbows, and plate armour was developed to protect soldiers from crossbows as well as the hand-held guns that were developed. Pole arms reached new prominence with the development of the Flemish and Swiss infantry armed with pikes and other long spears.\nIn agriculture, the increased usage of sheep with long-fibred wool allowed a stronger thread to be spun. In addition, the spinning wheel replaced the traditional distaff for spinning wool, tripling production. A less technological refinement that still greatly affected daily life was the use of buttons as closures for garments, which allowed for better fitting without having to lace clothing on the wearer. Windmills were refined with the creation of the tower mill, allowing the upper part of the windmill to be spun around to face the direction from which the wind was blowing. The blast furnace appeared around 1350 in Sweden, increasing the quantity of iron produced and improving its quality. The first patent law in 1447 in Venice protected the rights of inventors to their inventions.\nLate medieval art and architecture.\nThe Late Middle Ages in Europe correspond to Italy's Trecento and Early Renaissance cultural periods. Northern Europe and Spain continued to use Gothic styles, which became increasingly elaborate in the 15th century until almost the end. International Gothic was a courtly style that reached much of Europe in the decades around 1400, producing masterpieces such as the Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry. All over Europe secular art continued to increase in quantity and quality. In the 15th century, the mercantile classes of Italy and Flanders became important patrons, commissioning small portraits of themselves in oils as well as a growing range of luxury items such as jewellery, ivory caskets, cassone chests, and maiolica pottery. These objects also included the Hispano-Moresque ware produced by mostly Mud\u00e9jar potters in Spain. Although royalty owned huge plate collections, little survives except for the Royal Gold Cup. Italian silk manufacture developed so that Western churches and elites no longer needed to rely on imports from Byzantium or the Islamic world. In France and Flanders, tapestry weaving of sets like \"The Lady and the Unicorn\" became a major luxury industry.\nThe large external sculptural schemes of Early Gothic churches gave way to more sculpture inside the building, as tombs became more elaborate and other features such as pulpits were sometimes lavishly carved, as in the Pulpit by Giovanni Pisano in Sant'Andrea. Painted or carved wooden relief altarpieces became common, especially as churches created many side-chapels. Early Netherlandish painting by artists such as Jan van Eyck (d. 1441) and Rogier van der Weyden (d. 1464) rivalled that of Italy, as did northern illuminated manuscripts, which in the 15th century began to be collected on a large scale by secular elites, who also commissioned secular books, especially histories. From about 1450, printed books rapidly became popular, though still expensive. There were around 30,000 different editions of incunabula, or works printed before 1500, by which time illuminated manuscripts were commissioned only by royalty and a few others. Very small woodcuts, nearly all religious, were affordable even by peasants in parts of Northern Europe from the middle of the 15th century. More expensive engravings supplied a wealthier market with various images.\nModern perceptions.\nThe medieval period is frequently caricatured as a \"time of ignorance and superstition\" that placed \"the word of religious authorities over personal experience and rational activity.\" This is a legacy from both the Renaissance and Enlightenment when scholars favourably contrasted their intellectual cultures with those of the medieval period. Renaissance scholars saw the Middle Ages as a period of decline from the high culture and civilisation of the Classical world. Enlightenment scholars saw reason as superior to faith and thus viewed the Middle Ages as a time of ignorance and superstition.\nOthers argue that reason was held in high regard during the Middle Ages. Science historian Edward Grant writes, \"If revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed [in the 18th century], they were only made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities\". Also, contrary to common belief, David Lindberg writes, \"the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the Church and would have regarded himself as free (particularly in the natural sciences) to follow reason and observation wherever they led\".\nThe caricature of the period is also reflected in some more specific notions. One misconception, first propagated in the 19th century and still very common, is that all people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth was flat. This is untrue, as lecturers in medieval universities commonly argued that evidence showed the Earth was a sphere. Lindberg and Ronald Numbers, another scholar of the period, state that there \"was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [Earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference\". Other misconceptions such as \"the Church prohibited autopsies and dissections during the Middle Ages\", \"the rise of Christianity killed off ancient science\", or \"the medieval Christian Church suppressed the growth of natural philosophy\", are all cited by Numbers as examples of widely popular myths that still pass as historical truth, although they are not supported by historical research.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The basic feature of the median in describing data compared to the mean (often simply described as the \"average\") is that it is not skewed by a small proportion of extremely large or small values, and therefore provides a better representation of the center. Median income, for example, may be a better way to describe the center of the income distribution because increases in the largest incomes alone have no effect on the median. For this reason, the median is of central importance in robust statistics.\nMedian is a 2-quantile; it is the value that partitions a set into two equal parts.\nFinite set of numbers.\nThe median of a finite list of numbers is the \"middle\" number, when those numbers are listed in order from smallest to greatest.\nIf the data set has an odd number of observations, the middle one is selected (after arranging in ascending order). For example, the following list of seven numbers,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9\nhas the median of \"6\", which is the fourth value.\nIf the data set has an even number of observations, there is no distinct middle value and the median is usually defined to be the arithmetic mean of the two middle values. For example, this data set of 8 numbers\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9\nhas a median value of \"4.5\", that is formula_1. (In more technical terms, this interprets the median as the fully trimmed mid-range).\nIn general, with this convention, the median can be defined as follows: For a data set formula_2 of formula_3 elements, ordered from smallest to greatest,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;if formula_3 is odd, formula_5\nDefinition and notation.\nFormally, a median of a population is any value such that at least half of the population is less than or equal to the proposed median and at least half is greater than or equal to the proposed median. As seen above, medians may not be unique. If each set contains more than half the population, then some of the population is exactly equal to the unique median.\nThe median is well-defined for any ordered (one-dimensional) data and is independent of any distance metric. The median can thus be applied to school classes which are ranked but not numerical (e.g. working out a median grade when student test scores are graded from F to A), although the result might be halfway between classes if there is an even number of classes. (For odd number classes, one specific class is determined as the median.)\nA geometric median, on the other hand, is defined in any number of dimensions. A related concept, in which the outcome is forced to correspond to a member of the sample, is the medoid.\nThere is no widely accepted standard notation for the median, but some authors represent the median of a variable \"x\" as med(\"x\"), \"x\u0342\", as \"\u03bc\"1/2, or as \"M\". In any of these cases, the use of these or other symbols for the median needs to be explicitly defined when they are introduced.\nThe median is a special case of other ways of summarizing the typical values associated with a statistical distribution: it is the 2nd quartile, 5th decile, and 50th percentile.\nUses.\nThe median can be used as a measure of location when one attaches reduced importance to extreme values, typically because a distribution is skewed, extreme values are not known, or outliers are untrustworthy, i.e., may be measurement or transcription errors.\nFor example, consider the multiset\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 14.\nThe median is 2 in this case, as is the mode, and it might be seen as a better indication of the center than the arithmetic mean of 4, which is larger than all but one of the values. However, the widely cited empirical relationship that the mean is shifted \"further into the tail\" of a distribution than the median is not generally true. At most, one can say that the two statistics cannot be \"too far\" apart; see below.\nAs a median is based on the middle data in a set, it is not necessary to know the value of extreme results in order to calculate it. For example, in a psychology test investigating the time needed to solve a problem, if a small number of people failed to solve the problem at all in the given time a median can still be calculated.\nBecause the median is simple to understand and easy to calculate, while also a robust approximation to the mean, the median is a popular summary statistic in descriptive statistics. In this context, there are several choices for a measure of variability: the range, the interquartile range, the mean absolute deviation, and the median absolute deviation.\nFor practical purposes, different measures of location and dispersion are often compared on the basis of how well the corresponding population values can be estimated from a sample of data. The median, estimated using the sample median, has good properties in this regard. While it is not usually optimal if a given population distribution is assumed, its properties are always reasonably good. For example, a comparison of the efficiency of candidate estimators shows that the sample mean is more statistically efficient when\u2014and only when\u2014 data is uncontaminated by data from heavy-tailed distributions or from mixtures of distributions. Even then, the median has a 64% efficiency compared to the minimum-variance mean (for large normal samples), which is to say the variance of the median will be ~50% greater than the variance of the mean.\nProbability distributions.\nA median of a real-valued random variable formula_8 is a real number formula_9 that satisfies \nformula_10\nor, equivalently with the complementary events,\nformula_11\nSuch an formula_9 always exists, but needs not be uniquely determined. An equivalent phrasing uses the cumulative distribution function formula_13 of formula_14\nformula_15\n(cf. the drawing in the definition of expected value for arbitrary real-valued random variables).\nNote that this definition does not require \"X\" to have an absolutely continuous distribution (which has a probability density function \"f\"), nor does it require a discrete one. In the former case, the inequalities can be upgraded to equality: a median satisfies\nformula_16\nand\nformula_17\nAny probability distribution on the real number set formula_18 has at least one median, but in pathological cases there may be more than one median: if \"F\" is constant 1/2 on an interval (so that \"f\" = 0 there), then any value of that interval is a median.\nMedians of particular distributions.\nThe medians of certain types of distributions can be easily calculated from their parameters; furthermore, they exist even for some distributions lacking a well-defined mean, such as the Cauchy distribution:\nProperties.\nOptimality property.\nThe \"mean absolute error\" of a real variable \"c\" with respect to the random variable\u00a0\"X\" is\nformula_19\nProvided that the probability distribution of \"X\" is such that the above expectation exists, then \"m\" is a median of \"X\" if and only if \"m\" is a minimizer of the mean absolute error with respect to \"X\". In particular, if \"m\" is a sample median, then it minimizes the arithmetic mean of the absolute deviations. Note, however, that in cases where the sample contains an even number of elements, this minimizer is not unique.\nMore generally, a median is defined as a minimum of\nformula_20\nas discussed below in the section on multivariate medians (specifically, the spatial median).\nThis optimization-based definition of the median is useful in statistical data-analysis, for example, in \"k\"-medians clustering.\nInequality relating means and medians.\nIf the distribution has finite variance, then the distance between the median formula_21 and the mean formula_22 is bounded by one standard deviation.\nThis bound was proved by Book and Sher in 1979 for discrete samples, and more generally by Page and Murty in 1982. In a comment on a subsequent proof by O'Cinneide, Mallows in 1991 presented a compact proof that uses Jensen's inequality twice, as follows. Using |\u00b7| for the absolute value, we have\nformula_23\nThe first and third inequalities come from Jensen's inequality applied to the absolute-value function and the square function, which are each convex. The second inequality comes from the fact that a median minimizes the absolute deviation function formula_24.\nMallows's proof can be generalized to obtain a multivariate version of the inequality simply by replacing the absolute value with a norm:\nformula_25\nwhere \"m\" is a spatial median, that is, a minimizer of the function formula_26 The spatial median is unique when the data-set's dimension is two or more.\nAn alternative proof uses the one-sided Chebyshev inequality; it appears in an inequality on location and scale parameters. This formula also follows directly from Cantelli's inequality.\nUnimodal distributions.\nFor the case of unimodal distributions, one can achieve a sharper bound on the distance between the median and the mean:\nformula_27\nA similar relation holds between the median and the mode:\nformula_28\nMean, median, and skew.\nA typical heuristic is that positively skewed distributions have mean &gt; median. This is true for all members of the Pearson distribution family. However this is not always true. For example, the Weibull distribution family has members with positive mean, but mean &lt; median. Violations of the rule are particularly common for discrete distributions. For example, any Poisson distribution has positive skew, but its mean &lt; median whenever formula_29. See for a proof sketch.\nWhen the distribution has a monotonically decreasing probability density, then the median is less than the mean, as shown in the figure.\nJensen's inequality for medians.\nJensen's inequality states that for any random variable \"X\" with a finite expectation \"E\"[\"X\"] and for any convex function \"f\"\nformula_30\nThis inequality generalizes to the median as well. We say a function \"f\": R \u2192 R is a C function if, for any \"t\",\nformula_31\nis a closed interval (allowing the degenerate cases of a single point or an empty set). Every convex function is a C function, but the reverse does not hold. If \"f\" is a C function, then\nformula_32\nIf the medians are not unique, the statement holds for the corresponding suprema.\nMedians for samples.\nEfficient computation of the sample median.\nEven though comparison-sorting \"n\" items requires \u03a9(\"n\" log \"n\") operations, selection algorithms can compute the kth-smallest of n items with only \u0398(\"n\") operations. This includes the median, which is the th order statistic (or for an even number of samples, the arithmetic mean of the two middle order statistics).\nSelection algorithms still have the downside of requiring \u03a9(\"n\") memory, that is, they need to have the full sample (or a linear-sized portion of it) in memory. Because this, as well as the linear time requirement, can be prohibitive, several estimation procedures for the median have been developed. A simple one is the median of three rule, which estimates the median as the median of a three-element subsample; this is commonly used as a subroutine in the quicksort sorting algorithm, which uses an estimate of its input's median. A more robust estimator is Tukey's \"ninther\", which is the median of three rule applied with limited recursion: if A is the sample laid out as an array, and\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;med3(\"A\") = med(\"A\"[1], \"A\"[], \"A\"[\"n\"]),\nthen\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;ninther(\"A\") = med(med3(\"A\"[1 ... \"n\"]), med3(\"A\"[\"n\" ... \"n\"]), med3(\"A\"[\"n\" ... \"n\"]))\nThe \"remedian\" is an estimator for the median that requires linear time but sub-linear memory, operating in a single pass over the sample.\nSampling distribution.\nThe distributions of both the sample mean and the sample median were determined by Laplace. The distribution of the sample median from a population with a density function formula_33 is asymptotically normal with mean formula_9 and variance\nformula_35\nwhere formula_9 is the median of formula_33 and formula_3 is the sample size:\nformula_39\nA modern proof follows below. Laplace's result is now understood as a special case of the asymptotic distribution of arbitrary quantiles.\nFor normal samples, the density is formula_40, thus for large samples the variance of the median equals formula_41 (See also section #Efficiency below.)\nDerivation of the asymptotic distribution.\nWe take the sample size to be an odd number formula_42 and assume our variable continuous; the formula for the case of discrete variables is given below in . The sample can be summarized as \"below median\", \"at median\", and \"above median\", which corresponds to a trinomial distribution with probabilities formula_43, formula_44 and formula_45. For a continuous variable, the probability of multiple sample values being exactly equal to the median is 0, so one can calculate the density of at the point formula_46 directly from the trinomial distribution:\nformula_47\nNow we introduce the beta function. For integer arguments formula_48 and formula_49, this can be expressed as formula_50. Also, recall that formula_51. Using these relationships and setting both formula_48 and formula_49 equal to formula_54 allows the last expression to be written as\nformula_55\nHence the density function of the median is a symmetric beta distribution pushed forward by formula_56. Its mean, as we would expect, is 0.5 and its variance is formula_57. By the chain rule, the corresponding variance of the sample median is\nformula_58\nThe additional 2 is negligible in the limit.\nEmpirical local density.\nIn practice, the functions formula_59 and formula_60 above are often not known or assumed. However, they can be estimated from an observed frequency distribution. In this section, we give an example. Consider the following table, representing a sample of 3,800 (discrete-valued) observations:\nBecause the observations are discrete-valued, constructing the exact distribution of the median is not an immediate translation of the above expression for formula_61; one may (and typically does) have multiple instances of the median in one's sample. So we must sum over all these possibilities:\nformula_62\nHere, \"i\" is the number of points strictly less than the median and \"k\" the number strictly greater.\nUsing these preliminaries, it is possible to investigate the effect of sample size on the standard errors of the mean and median. The observed mean is 3.16, the observed raw median is 3 and the observed interpolated median is 3.174. The following table gives some comparison statistics.\nThe expected value of the median falls slightly as sample size increases while, as would be expected, the standard errors of both the median and the mean are proportionate to the inverse square root of the sample size. The asymptotic approximation errs on the side of caution by overestimating the standard error.\nEstimation of variance from sample data.\nThe value of formula_63\u2014the asymptotic value of formula_64 where formula_65 is the population median\u2014has been studied by several authors. The standard \"delete one\" jackknife method produces inconsistent results. An alternative\u2014the \"delete k\" method\u2014where formula_66 grows with the sample size has been shown to be asymptotically consistent. This method may be computationally expensive for large data sets. A bootstrap estimate is known to be consistent, but converges very slowly (order of formula_67). Other methods have been proposed but their behavior may differ between large and small samples.\nEfficiency.\nThe efficiency of the sample median, measured as the ratio of the variance of the mean to the variance of the median, depends on the sample size and on the underlying population distribution. For a sample of size formula_68 from the normal distribution, the efficiency for large N is\nformula_69\nThe efficiency tends to formula_70 as formula_71 tends to infinity.\nIn other words, the relative variance of the median will be formula_72, or 57% greater than the variance of the mean \u2013 the relative standard error of the median will be formula_73, or 25% greater than the standard error of the mean, formula_74 (see also section #Sampling distribution above.).\nOther estimators.\nFor univariate distributions that are \"symmetric\" about one median, the Hodges\u2013Lehmann estimator is a robust and highly efficient estimator of the population median.\nIf data is represented by a statistical model specifying a particular family of probability distributions, then estimates of the median can be obtained by fitting that family of probability distributions to the data and calculating the theoretical median of the fitted distribution. Pareto interpolation is an application of this when the population is assumed to have a Pareto distribution.\nMultivariate median.\nPreviously, this article discussed the univariate median, when the sample or population had one-dimension. When the dimension is two or higher, there are multiple concepts that extend the definition of the univariate median; each such multivariate median agrees with the univariate median when the dimension is exactly one.\nMarginal median.\nThe marginal median is defined for vectors defined with respect to a fixed set of coordinates. A marginal median is defined to be the vector whose components are univariate medians. The marginal median is easy to compute, and its properties were studied by Puri and Sen.\nGeometric median.\nThe geometric median of a discrete set of sample points formula_75 in a Euclidean space is the point minimizing the sum of distances to the sample points.\nformula_76\nIn contrast to the marginal median, the geometric median is equivariant with respect to Euclidean similarity transformations such as translations and rotations.\nMedian in all directions.\nIf the marginal medians for all coordinate systems coincide, then their common location may be termed the \"median in all directions\". This concept is relevant to voting theory on account of the median voter theorem. When it exists, the median in all directions coincides with the geometric median (at least for discrete distributions).\nConditional median.\nThe conditional median occurs in the setting where we seek to estimate a random variable formula_77 from a random variable formula_78, which is a noisy version of formula_77. The conditional median in this setting is given by \nformula_80\nwhere formula_81 is the inverse of the conditional cdf (i.e., conditional quantile function) of formula_82. For example, a popular model is formula_83 where formula_84 is standard normal independent of formula_8. The conditional median is the optimal Bayesian formula_86 estimator:\nformula_87\nIt is known that for the model formula_83 where formula_84 is standard normal independent of formula_8, the estimator is linear if and only if formula_8 is Gaussian. \nOther median-related concepts.\nInterpolated median.\nWhen dealing with a discrete variable, it is sometimes useful to regard the observed values as being midpoints of underlying continuous intervals. An example of this is a Likert scale, on which opinions or preferences are expressed on a scale with a set number of possible responses. If the scale consists of the positive integers, an observation of 3 might be regarded as representing the interval from 2.50 to 3.50. It is possible to estimate the median of the underlying variable. If, say, 22% of the observations are of value 2 or below and 55.0% are of 3 or below (so 33% have the value 3), then the median formula_92 is 3 since the median is the smallest value of formula_93 for which formula_94 is greater than a half. But the interpolated median is somewhere between 2.50 and 3.50. First we add half of the interval width formula_95 to the median to get the upper bound of the median interval. Then we subtract that proportion of the interval width which equals the proportion of the 33% which lies above the 50% mark. In other words, we split up the interval width pro rata to the numbers of observations. In this case, the 33% is split into 28% below the median and 5% above it so we subtract 5/33 of the interval width from the upper bound of 3.50 to give an interpolated median of 3.35. More formally, if the values formula_96 are known, the interpolated median can be calculated from\nformula_97\nAlternatively, if in an observed sample there are formula_98 scores above the median category, formula_99 scores in it and formula_100 scores below it then the interpolated median is given by\nformula_101\nPseudo-median.\nFor univariate distributions that are \"symmetric\" about one median, the Hodges\u2013Lehmann estimator is a robust and highly efficient estimator of the population median; for non-symmetric distributions, the Hodges\u2013Lehmann estimator is a robust and highly efficient estimator of the population \"pseudo-median\", which is the median of a symmetrized distribution and which is close to the population median. The Hodges\u2013Lehmann estimator has been generalized to multivariate distributions.\nVariants of regression.\nThe Theil\u2013Sen estimator is a method for robust linear regression based on finding medians of slopes.\nMedian filter.\nThe median filter is an important tool of image processing, that can effectively remove any salt-and-pepper noise from grayscale images.\nCluster analysis.\nIn cluster analysis, the k-medians clustering algorithm provides a way of defining clusters, in which the criterion of maximising the distance between cluster-means that is used in k-means clustering, is replaced by maximising the distance between cluster-medians.\nMedian\u2013median line.\nThis is a method of robust regression. The idea dates back to Wald in 1940 who suggested dividing a set of bivariate data into two halves depending on the value of the independent parameter formula_2: a left half with values less than the median and a right half with values greater than the median. He suggested taking the means of the dependent formula_103 and independent formula_2 variables of the left and the right halves and estimating the slope of the line joining these two points. The line could then be adjusted to fit the majority of the points in the data set.\nNair and Shrivastava in 1942 suggested a similar idea but instead advocated dividing the sample into three equal parts before calculating the means of the subsamples. Brown and Mood in 1951 proposed the idea of using the medians of two subsamples rather the means. Tukey combined these ideas and recommended dividing the sample into three equal size subsamples and estimating the line based on the medians of the subsamples.\nMedian-unbiased estimators.\nAny \"mean\"-unbiased estimator minimizes the risk (expected loss) with respect to the squared-error loss function, as observed by Gauss. A \"median\"-unbiased estimator minimizes the risk with respect to the absolute-deviation loss function, as observed by Laplace. Other loss functions are used in statistical theory, particularly in robust statistics.\nThe theory of median-unbiased estimators was revived by George W. Brown in 1947:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;An estimate of a one-dimensional parameter \u03b8 will be said to be median-unbiased if, for fixed \u03b8, the median of the distribution of the estimate is at the value \u03b8; i.e., the estimate underestimates just as often as it overestimates. This requirement seems for most purposes to accomplish as much as the mean-unbiased requirement and has the additional property that it is invariant under one-to-one transformation.\u2014\u200a\nFurther properties of median-unbiased estimators have been reported. \nThere are methods of constructing median-unbiased estimators that are optimal (in a sense analogous to the minimum-variance property for mean-unbiased estimators). Such constructions exist for probability distributions having monotone likelihood-functions. One such procedure is an analogue of the Rao\u2013Blackwell procedure for mean-unbiased estimators: The procedure holds for a smaller class of probability distributions than does the Rao\u2014Blackwell procedure but for a larger class of loss functions.\nHistory.\nScientific researchers in the ancient near east appear not to have used summary statistics altogether, instead choosing values that offered maximal consistency with a broader theory that integrated a wide variety of phenomena. Within the Mediterranean (and, later, European) scholarly community, statistics like the mean are fundamentally a medieval and early modern development. (The history of the median outside Europe and its predecessors remains relatively unstudied.)\nThe idea of the median appeared in the 6th century in the Talmud, in order to fairly analyze divergent appraisals. However, the concept did not spread to the broader scientific community.\nInstead, the closest ancestor of the modern median is the mid-range, invented by Al-Biruni Transmission of his work to later scholars is unclear. He applied his technique to assaying currency metals, but, after he published his work, most assayers still adopted the most unfavorable value from their results, lest they appear to cheat. However, increased navigation at sea during the Age of Discovery meant that ship's navigators increasingly had to attempt to determine latitude in unfavorable weather against hostile shores, leading to renewed interest in summary statistics. Whether rediscovered or independently invented, the mid-range is recommended to nautical navigators in Harriot's \"Instructions for Raleigh's Voyage to Guiana, 1595\".\nThe idea of the median may have first appeared in Edward Wright's 1599 book \"Certaine Errors in Navigation\" on a section about compass navigation. Wright was reluctant to discard measured values, and may have felt that the median \u2014 incorporating a greater proportion of the dataset than the mid-range \u2014 was more likely to be correct. However, Wright did not give examples of his technique's use, making it hard to verify that he described the modern notion of median. The median (in the context of probability) certainly appeared in the correspondence of Christiaan Huygens, but as an example of a statistic that was inappropriate for actuarial practice.\nThe earliest recommendation of the median dates to 1757, when Roger Joseph Boscovich developed a regression method based on the \"L\"1 norm and therefore implicitly on the median. In 1774, Laplace made this desire explicit: he suggested the median be used as the standard estimator of the value of a posterior PDF. The specific criterion was to minimize the expected magnitude of the error; formula_105 where formula_106 is the estimate and formula_107 is the true value. To this end, Laplace determined the distributions of both the sample mean and the sample median in the early 1800s. However, a decade later, Gauss and Legendre developed the least squares method, which minimizes formula_108 to obtain the mean; the strong justification of this estimator by reference to maximum likelihood estimation based on a normal distribution means it has mostly replaced Laplace's original suggestion.\nAntoine Augustin Cournot in 1843 was the first to use the term \"median\" (\"valeur m\u00e9diane\") for the value that divides a probability distribution into two equal halves. Gustav Theodor Fechner used the median (\"Centralwerth\") in sociological and psychological phenomena. It had earlier been used only in astronomy and related fields. Gustav Fechner popularized the median into the formal analysis of data, although it had been used previously by Laplace, and the median appeared in a textbook by F. Y. Edgeworth. Francis Galton used the term \"median\" in 1881, having earlier used the terms \"middle-most value\" in 1869, and the \"medium\" in 1880.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n\"This article incorporates material from Median of a distribution on PlanetMath, which is licensed under the .\""}

Mammals are characterised by the presence of milk-producing mammary glands for feeding their young, a broad neocortex region of the brain, fur or hair, and three middle ear bones. These characteristics distinguish them from reptiles and birds, from which their ancestors diverged in the Carboniferous Period over 300\u00a0million years ago. Around 6,640 extant species of mammals have been described and divided into 27 orders. The study of mammals is called mammalogy.\nThe largest orders of mammals, by number of species, are the rodents, bats, and eulipotyphlans (including hedgehogs, moles and shrews). The next three are the primates (including humans, monkeys and lemurs), the even-toed ungulates (including pigs, bovids and whales), and the Carnivora (including cats, dogs, and seals).\nMammals are the only living members of Synapsida; this clade, together with Sauropsida (reptiles and birds), constitutes the larger Amniota clade. Early synapsids are referred to as \"pelycosaurs.\" The more advanced therapsids became dominant during the Guadalupian. Mammals originated from cynodonts, an advanced group of therapsids, during the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic. Mammals achieved their modern diversity in the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era, after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, and have been the dominant terrestrial animal group from 66\u00a0million years ago to the present.\nThe basic mammalian body type is quadrupedal, with most mammals using four limbs for terrestrial locomotion; but in some, the limbs are adapted for life at sea, in the air, in trees or underground. The bipeds have adapted to move using only the two lower limbs, while the rear limbs of cetaceans and the sea cows are mere internal vestiges. Mammals range in size from the bumblebee bat to the blue whale\u2014possibly the largest animal to have ever lived. Maximum lifespan varies from two years for the shrew to 211 years for the bowhead whale. All modern mammals give birth to live young, except the five species of monotremes, which lay eggs. The most species-rich group is the viviparous placental mammals, so named for the temporary organ (placenta) used by offspring to draw nutrition from the mother during gestation.\nMost mammals are intelligent, with some possessing large brains, self-awareness, and tool use. Mammals can communicate and vocalise in several ways, including the production of ultrasound, scent marking, alarm signals, singing, echolocation; and, in the case of humans, complex language. Mammals can organise themselves into fission\u2013fusion societies, harems, and hierarchies\u2014but can also be solitary and territorial. Most mammals are polygynous, but some can be monogamous or polyandrous.\nDomestication of many types of mammals by humans played a major role in the Neolithic Revolution, and resulted in farming replacing hunting and gathering as the primary source of food for humans. This led to a major restructuring of human societies from nomadic to sedentary, with more co-operation among larger and larger groups, and ultimately the development of the first civilisations. Domesticated mammals provided, and continue to provide, power for transport and agriculture, as well as food (meat and dairy products), fur, and leather. Mammals are also hunted and raced for sport, kept as pets and working animals of various types, and are used as model organisms in science. Mammals have been depicted in art since Paleolithic times, and appear in literature, film, mythology, and religion. Decline in numbers and extinction of many mammals is primarily driven by human poaching and habitat destruction, primarily deforestation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nClassification.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMammal classification has been through several revisions since Carl Linnaeus initially defined the class, and at present, no classification system is universally accepted. McKenna &amp; Bell (1997) and Wilson &amp; Reeder (2005) provide useful recent compendiums. Simpson (1945) provides systematics of mammal origins and relationships that had been taught universally until the end of the 20th\u00a0century.\nHowever, since 1945, a large amount of new and more detailed information has gradually been found: The paleontological record has been recalibrated, and the intervening years have seen much debate and progress concerning the theoretical underpinnings of systematisation itself, partly through the new concept of cladistics. Though fieldwork and lab work progressively outdated Simpson's classification, it remains the closest thing to an official classification of mammals, despite its known issues.\nMost mammals, including the six most species-rich orders, belong to the placental group. The three largest orders in numbers of species are Rodentia: mice, rats, porcupines, beavers, capybaras, and other gnawing mammals; Chiroptera: bats; and Eulipotyphla: shrews, moles, and solenodons. The next three biggest orders, depending on the biological classification scheme used, are the primates: apes, monkeys, and lemurs; Cetartiodactyla: whales and even-toed ungulates; and Carnivora which includes cats, dogs, weasels, bears, seals, and allies. According to \"Mammal Species of the World\", 5,416\u00a0species were identified in 2006. These were grouped into 1,229\u00a0genera, 153\u00a0families and 29\u00a0orders. In 2008, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) completed a five-year Global Mammal Assessment for its IUCN Red List, which counted 5,488\u00a0species. According to research published in the \"Journal of Mammalogy\" in 2018, the number of recognised mammal species is 6,495, including 96\u00a0recently extinct.\nDefinitions.\nThe word \"mammal\" is modern, from the scientific name \"Mammalia\" coined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, derived from the Latin \"mamma\" (\"teat, pap\"). In an influential 1988 paper, Timothy Rowe defined Mammalia phylogenetically as the crown group of mammals, the clade consisting of the most recent common ancestor of living monotremes (echidnas and platypuses) and therians (marsupials and placentals) and all descendants of that ancestor. Since this ancestor lived in the Jurassic Period, Rowe's definition excludes all animals from the earlier Triassic, despite the fact that Triassic fossils in the Haramiyida have been referred to the Mammalia since the mid-19th century. If Mammalia is considered as the crown group, its origin can be roughly dated as the first known appearance of animals more closely related to some extant mammals than to others. \"Ambondro\" is more closely related to monotremes than to therian mammals while \"Amphilestes\" and \"Amphitherium\" are more closely related to the therians; as fossils of all three genera are dated about https:// million years ago in the Middle Jurassic, this is a reasonable estimate for the appearance of the crown group.\nT. S. Kemp has provided a more traditional definition: \"Synapsids that possess a dentary\u2013squamosal jaw articulation and occlusion between upper and lower molars with a transverse component to the movement\" or, equivalently in Kemp's view, the clade originating with the last common ancestor of \"Sinoconodon\" and living mammals. The earliest-known synapsid satisfying Kemp's definitions is \"Tikitherium\", dated https:// Ma, so the appearance of mammals in this broader sense can be given this Late Triassic date. However, this animal may have actually evolved during the Neogene.\nMolecular classification of placentals.\nAs of the early 21st century, molecular studies based on DNA analysis have suggested new relationships among mammal families. Most of these findings have been independently validated by retrotransposon presence/absence data. Classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placentals\u2014Afrotheria, Xenarthra and Boreoeutheria\u2014which diverged in the Cretaceous. The relationships between these three lineages is contentious, and all three possible hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is basal. These hypotheses are Atlantogenata (basal Boreoeutheria), Epitheria (basal Xenarthra) and Exafroplacentalia (basal Afrotheria). Boreoeutheria in turn contains two major lineages\u2014Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria.\nEstimates for the divergence times between these three placental groups range from 105 to 120\u00a0million years ago, depending on the type of DNA used (such as nuclear or mitochondrial) and varying interpretations of paleogeographic data.\nMammal phylogeny according to \u00c1lvarez-Carretero \"et al.\", 2022:\nEvolution.\nOrigins.\nSynapsida, a clade that contains mammals and their extinct relatives, originated during the Pennsylvanian subperiod (~323\u00a0million to ~300\u00a0million years ago), when they split from the reptile lineage. Crown group mammals evolved from earlier mammaliaforms during the Early Jurassic. The cladogram takes Mammalia to be the crown group.\nEvolution from older amniotes.\nThe first fully terrestrial vertebrates were amniotes. Like their amphibious early tetrapod predecessors, they had lungs and limbs. Amniotic eggs, however, have internal membranes that allow the developing embryo to breathe but keep water in. Hence, amniotes can lay eggs on dry land, while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water.\nThe first amniotes apparently arose in the Pennsylvanian subperiod of the Carboniferous. They descended from earlier reptiliomorph amphibious tetrapods, which lived on land that was already inhabited by insects and other invertebrates as well as ferns, mosses and other plants. Within a few million years, two important amniote lineages became distinct: the synapsids, which would later include the common ancestor of the mammals; and the sauropsids, which now include turtles, lizards, snakes, crocodilians and dinosaurs (including birds). Synapsids have a single hole (temporal fenestra) low on each side of the skull. Primitive synapsids included the largest and fiercest animals of the early Permian such as \"Dimetrodon\". Nonmammalian synapsids were traditionally\u2014and incorrectly\u2014called \"mammal-like reptiles\" or pelycosaurs; we now know they were neither reptiles nor part of reptile lineage.\nTherapsids, a group of synapsids, evolved in the Middle Permian, about 265\u00a0million years ago, and became the dominant land vertebrates. They differ from basal eupelycosaurs in several features of the skull and jaws, including: larger skulls and incisors which are equal in size in therapsids, but not for eupelycosaurs. The therapsid lineage leading to mammals went through a series of stages, beginning with animals that were very similar to their early synapsid ancestors and ending with probainognathian cynodonts, some of which could easily be mistaken for mammals. Those stages were characterised by:\nFirst mammals.\nThe Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event about 252\u00a0million years ago, which was a prolonged event due to the accumulation of several extinction pulses, ended the dominance of carnivorous therapsids. In the early Triassic, most medium to large land carnivore niches were taken over by archosaurs which, over an extended period (35\u00a0million years), came to include the crocodylomorphs, the pterosaurs and the dinosaurs; however, large cynodonts like \"Trucidocynodon\" and traversodontids still occupied large sized carnivorous and herbivorous niches respectively. By the Jurassic, the dinosaurs had come to dominate the large terrestrial herbivore niches as well.\nThe first mammals (in Kemp's sense) appeared in the Late Triassic epoch (about 225\u00a0million years ago), 40\u00a0million years after the first therapsids. They expanded out of their nocturnal insectivore niche from the mid-Jurassic onwards; the Jurassic \"Castorocauda\", for example, was a close relative of true mammals that had adaptations for swimming, digging and catching fish. Most, if not all, are thought to have remained nocturnal (the nocturnal bottleneck), accounting for much of the typical mammalian traits. The majority of the mammal species that existed in the Mesozoic Era were multituberculates, eutriconodonts and spalacotheriids. The earliest-known fossil of the Metatheria (\"changed beasts\") is \"Sinodelphys\", found in 125-million-year-old Early Cretaceous shale in China's northeastern Liaoning Province. The fossil is nearly complete and includes tufts of fur and imprints of soft tissues.\nThe oldest-known fossil among the Eutheria (\"true beasts\") is the small shrewlike \"Juramaia sinensis\", or \"Jurassic mother from China\", dated to 160\u00a0million years ago in the late Jurassic. A later eutherian relative, \"Eomaia\", dated to 125\u00a0million years ago in the early Cretaceous, possessed some features in common with the marsupials but not with the placentals, evidence that these features were present in the last common ancestor of the two groups but were later lost in the placental lineage. In particular, the epipubic bones extend forwards from the pelvis. These are not found in any modern placental, but they are found in marsupials, monotremes, other nontherian mammals and \"Ukhaatherium\", an early Cretaceous animal in the eutherian order Asioryctitheria. This also applies to the multituberculates. They are apparently an ancestral feature, which subsequently disappeared in the placental lineage. These epipubic bones seem to function by stiffening the muscles during locomotion, reducing the amount of space being presented, which placentals require to contain their fetus during gestation periods. A narrow pelvic outlet indicates that the young were very small at birth and therefore pregnancy was short, as in modern marsupials. This suggests that the placenta was a later development.\nOne of the earliest-known monotremes was \"Teinolophos\", which lived about 120\u00a0million years ago in Australia. Monotremes have some features which may be inherited from the original amniotes such as the same orifice to urinate, defecate and reproduce (cloaca)\u2014as reptiles and birds also do\u2014 and they lay eggs which are leathery and uncalcified.\nEarliest appearances of features.\n\"Hadrocodium\", whose fossils date from approximately 195\u00a0million years ago, in the early Jurassic, provides the first clear evidence of a jaw joint formed solely by the squamosal and dentary bones; there is no space in the jaw for the articular, a bone involved in the jaws of all early synapsids.\nThe earliest clear evidence of hair or fur is in fossils of \"Castorocauda\" and \"Megaconus\", from 164\u00a0million years ago in the mid-Jurassic. In the 1950s, it was suggested that the foramina (passages) in the maxillae and premaxillae (bones in the front of the upper jaw) of cynodonts were channels which supplied blood vessels and nerves to vibrissae (whiskers) and so were evidence of hair or fur; it was soon pointed out, however, that foramina do not necessarily show that an animal had vibrissae, as the modern lizard \"Tupinambis\" has foramina that are almost identical to those found in the nonmammalian cynodont \"Thrinaxodon\". Popular sources, nevertheless, continue to attribute whiskers to \"Thrinaxodon\". Studies on Permian coprolites suggest that non-mammalian synapsids of the epoch already had fur, setting the evolution of hairs possibly as far back as dicynodonts.\nWhen endothermy first appeared in the evolution of mammals is uncertain, though it is generally agreed to have first evolved in non-mammalian therapsids. Modern monotremes have lower body temperatures and more variable metabolic rates than marsupials and placentals, but there is evidence that some of their ancestors, perhaps including ancestors of the therians, may have had body temperatures like those of modern therians. Likewise, some modern therians like afrotheres and xenarthrans have secondarily developed lower body temperatures.\nThe evolution of erect limbs in mammals is incomplete\u2014living and fossil monotremes have sprawling limbs. The parasagittal (nonsprawling) limb posture appeared sometime in the late Jurassic or early Cretaceous; it is found in the eutherian \"Eomaia\" and the metatherian \"Sinodelphys\", both dated to 125\u00a0million years ago. Epipubic bones, a feature that strongly influenced the reproduction of most mammal clades, are first found in Tritylodontidae, suggesting that it is a synapomorphy between them and Mammaliaformes. They are omnipresent in non-placental Mammaliaformes, though \"Megazostrodon\" and \"Erythrotherium\" appear to have lacked them.\nIt has been suggested that the original function of lactation (milk production) was to keep eggs moist. Much of the argument is based on monotremes, the egg-laying mammals. In human females, mammary glands become fully developed during puberty, regardless of pregnancy.\nRise of the mammals.\nTherians took over the medium- to large-sized ecological niches in the Cenozoic, after the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event approximately 66\u00a0million years ago emptied ecological space once filled by non-avian dinosaurs and other groups of reptiles, as well as various other mammal groups, and underwent an exponential increase in body size (megafauna). The increase in mammalian diversity was not, however, solely because of expansion into large-bodied niches. Mammals diversified very quickly, displaying an exponential rise in diversity. For example, the earliest-known bat dates from about 50\u00a0million years ago, only 16\u00a0million years after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs.\nMolecular phylogenetic studies initially suggested that most placental orders diverged about 100 to 85\u00a0million years ago and that modern families appeared in the period from the late Eocene through the Miocene. However, no placental fossils have been found from before the end of the Cretaceous. The earliest undisputed fossils of placentals come from the early Paleocene, after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. (Scientists identified an early Paleocene animal named \"Protungulatum donnae\" as one of the first placental mammals, but it has since been reclassified as a non-placental eutherian.) Recalibrations of genetic and morphological diversity rates have suggested a Late Cretaceous origin for placentals, and a Paleocene origin for most modern clades.\nThe earliest-known ancestor of primates is \"Archicebus achilles\" from around 55\u00a0million years ago. This tiny primate weighed 20\u201330 grams (0.7\u20131.1 ounce) and could fit within a human palm.\nAnatomy.\nDistinguishing features.\nLiving mammal species can be identified by the presence of sweat glands, including those that are specialised to produce milk to nourish their young. In classifying fossils, however, other features must be used, since soft tissue glands and many other features are not visible in fossils.\nMany traits shared by all living mammals appeared among the earliest members of the group:\nFor the most part, these characteristics were not present in the Triassic ancestors of the mammals. Nearly all mammaliaforms possess an epipubic bone, the exception being modern placentals.\nSexual dimorphism.\nOn average, male mammals are larger than females, with males being at least 10% larger than females in over 45% of investigated species. Most mammalian orders also exhibit male-biased sexual dimorphism, although some orders do not show any bias or are significantly female-biased (Lagomorpha). Sexual size dimorphism increases with body size across mammals (Rensch's rule), suggesting that there are parallel selection pressures on both male and female size. Male-biased dimorphism relates to sexual selection on males through male\u2013male competition for females, as there is a positive correlation between the degree of sexual selection, as indicated by mating systems, and the degree of male-biased size dimorphism. The degree of sexual selection is also positively correlated with male and female size across mammals. Further, parallel selection pressure on female mass is identified in that age at weaning is significantly higher in more polygynous species, even when correcting for body mass. Also, the reproductive rate is lower for larger females, indicating that fecundity selection selects for smaller females in mammals. Although these patterns hold across mammals as a whole, there is considerable variation across orders.\nBiological systems.\nThe majority of mammals have seven cervical vertebrae (bones in the neck). The exceptions are the manatee and the two-toed sloth, which have six, and the three-toed sloth which has nine. All mammalian brains possess a neocortex, a brain region unique to mammals. Placental brains have a corpus callosum, unlike monotremes and marsupials.\nCirculatory systems.\nThe mammalian heart has four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The heart has four valves, which separate its chambers and ensures blood flows in the correct direction through the heart (preventing backflow). After gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries (blood vessels in the lungs), oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium via one of the four pulmonary veins. Blood flows nearly continuously back into the atrium, which acts as the receiving chamber, and from here through an opening into the left ventricle. Most blood flows passively into the heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed, but toward the end of the ventricular relaxation period, the left atrium will contract, pumping blood into the ventricle. The heart also requires nutrients and oxygen found in blood like other muscles, and is supplied via coronary arteries.\nThe red blood cells of mammals also lack a nucleus to make space for more haemoglobin, which significantly increases the cell's oxygen-carrying capacity.\nRespiratory systems.\nThe lungs of mammals are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly achieved with the diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing the volume of the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing the volume of the lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.\nIntegumentary systems.\nThe integumentary system (skin) is made up of three layers: the outermost epidermis, the dermis and the hypodermis. The epidermis is typically 10 to 30 cells thick; its main function is to provide a waterproof layer. Its outermost cells are constantly lost; its bottommost cells are constantly dividing and pushing upward. The middle layer, the dermis, is 15 to 40 times thicker than the epidermis. The dermis is made up of many components, such as bony structures and blood vessels. The hypodermis is made up of adipose tissue, which stores lipids and provides cushioning and insulation. The thickness of this layer varies widely from species to species; marine mammals require a thick hypodermis (blubber) for insulation, and right whales have the thickest blubber at . Although other animals have features such as whiskers, feathers, setae, or cilia that superficially resemble it, no animals other than mammals have hair. It is a definitive characteristic of the class, though some mammals have very little.\nDigestive systems.\nHerbivores have developed a diverse range of physical structures to facilitate the consumption of plant material. To break up intact plant tissues, mammals have developed teeth structures that reflect their feeding preferences. For instance, frugivores (animals that feed primarily on fruit) and herbivores that feed on soft foliage have low-crowned teeth specialised for grinding foliage and seeds. Grazing animals that tend to eat hard, silica-rich grasses, have high-crowned teeth, which are capable of grinding tough plant tissues and do not wear down as quickly as low-crowned teeth. Most carnivorous mammals have carnassial teeth (of varying length depending on diet), long canines and similar tooth replacement patterns.\nThe stomach of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla) is divided into four sections: the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum and the abomasum (only ruminants have a rumen). After the plant material is consumed, it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into solid and liquid material. The solids lump together to form a bolus (or cud), and is regurgitated. When the bolus enters the mouth, the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and swallowed again. Ingested food passes to the rumen and reticulum where cellulolytic microbes (bacteria, protozoa and fungi) produce cellulase, which is needed to break down the cellulose in plants. Perissodactyls, in contrast to the ruminants, store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged cecum, where it is fermented by bacteria. Carnivora have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat, as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals, which are necessary to break down tough, complex plant fibres. The cecum is either absent or short and simple, and the large intestine is not sacculated or much wider than the small intestine.\nExcretory and genitourinary systems.\nThe mammalian excretory system involves many components. Like amphibians, mammals are ureotelic, and convert ammonia into urea, which is done by the liver as part of the urea cycle. Bilirubin, a waste product derived from blood cells, is passed through bile and urine with the help of enzymes excreted by the liver. The passing of bilirubin via bile through the intestinal tract gives mammalian feces a distinctive brown coloration. Distinctive features of the mammalian kidney include the presence of the renal pelvis and renal pyramids, and of a clearly distinguishable cortex and medulla, which is due to the presence of elongated loops of Henle. Only the mammalian kidney has a bean shape, although there are some exceptions, such as the multilobed reniculate kidneys of pinnipeds, cetaceans and bears. Most adult placentals have no remaining trace of the cloaca. In the embryo, the embryonic cloaca divides into a posterior region that becomes part of the anus, and an anterior region that has different fates depending on the sex of the individual: in females, it develops into the vestibule or urogenital sinus that receives the urethra and vagina, while in males it forms the entirety of the penile urethra. However, the afrosoricids and some shrews retain a cloaca as adults. In marsupials, the genital tract is separate from the anus, but a trace of the original cloaca does remain externally. Monotremes, which translates from Greek into \"single hole\", have a true cloaca. Urine flows from the ureters into the cloaca in monotremes and into the bladder in placentals.\nSound production.\nAs in all other tetrapods, mammals have a larynx that can quickly open and close to produce sounds, and a supralaryngeal vocal tract which filters this sound. The lungs and surrounding musculature provide the air stream and pressure required to phonate. The larynx controls the pitch and volume of sound, but the strength the lungs exert to exhale also contributes to volume. More primitive mammals, such as the echidna, can only hiss, as sound is achieved solely through exhaling through a partially closed larynx. Other mammals phonate using vocal folds. The movement or tenseness of the vocal folds can result in many sounds such as purring and screaming. Mammals can change the position of the larynx, allowing them to breathe through the nose while swallowing through the mouth, and to form both oral and nasal sounds; nasal sounds, such as a dog whine, are generally soft sounds, and oral sounds, such as a dog bark, are generally loud.\nSome mammals have a large larynx and thus a low-pitched voice, namely the hammer-headed bat (\"Hypsignathus monstrosus\") where the larynx can take up the entirety of the thoracic cavity while pushing the lungs, heart, and trachea into the abdomen. Large vocal pads can also lower the pitch, as in the low-pitched roars of big cats. The production of infrasound is possible in some mammals such as the African elephant (\"Loxodonta\" spp.) and baleen whales. Small mammals with small larynxes have the ability to produce ultrasound, which can be detected by modifications to the middle ear and cochlea. Ultrasound is inaudible to birds and reptiles, which might have been important during the Mesozoic, when birds and reptiles were the dominant predators. This private channel is used by some rodents in, for example, mother-to-pup communication, and by bats when echolocating. Toothed whales also use echolocation, but, as opposed to the vocal membrane that extends upward from the vocal folds, they have a melon to manipulate sounds. Some mammals, namely the primates, have air sacs attached to the larynx, which may function to lower the resonances or increase the volume of sound.\nThe vocal production system is controlled by the cranial nerve nuclei in the brain, and supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve, branches of the vagus nerve. The vocal tract is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerves. Electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal grey (PEG) region of the mammalian midbrain elicit vocalisations. The ability to learn new vocalisations is only exemplified in humans, seals, cetaceans, elephants and possibly bats; in humans, this is the result of a direct connection between the motor cortex, which controls movement, and the motor neurons in the spinal cord.\nFur.\nThe primary function of the fur of mammals is thermoregulation. Others include protection, sensory purposes, waterproofing, and camouflage. Different types of fur serve different purposes:\nThermoregulation.\nHair length is not a factor in thermoregulation: for example, some tropical mammals such as sloths have the same length of fur length as some arctic mammals but with less insulation; and, conversely, other tropical mammals with short hair have the same insulating value as arctic mammals. The denseness of fur can increase an animal's insulation value, and arctic mammals especially have dense fur; for example, the musk ox has guard hairs measuring as well as a dense underfur, which forms an airtight coat, allowing them to survive in temperatures of . Some desert mammals, such as camels, use dense fur to prevent solar heat from reaching their skin, allowing the animal to stay cool; a camel's fur may reach in the summer, but the skin stays at . Aquatic mammals, conversely, trap air in their fur to conserve heat by keeping the skin dry.\nColoration.\nMammalian coats are coloured for a variety of reasons, the major selective pressures including camouflage, sexual selection, communication, and thermoregulation. Coloration in both the hair and skin of mammals is mainly determined by the type and amount of melanin; eumelanins for brown and black colours and pheomelanin for a range of yellowish to reddish colours, giving mammals an earth tone. Some mammals have more vibrant colours; certain monkeys such mandrills and vervet monkeys, and opossums such as the Mexican mouse opossums and Derby's woolly opossums, have blue skin due to light diffraction in collagen fibres. Many sloths appear green because their fur hosts green algae; this may be a symbiotic relation that affords camouflage to the sloths.\nCamouflage is a powerful influence in a large number of mammals, as it helps to conceal individuals from predators or prey. In arctic and subarctic mammals such as the arctic fox (\"Alopex lagopus\"), collared lemming (\"Dicrostonyx groenlandicus\"), stoat (\"Mustela erminea\"), and snowshoe hare (\"Lepus americanus\"), seasonal color change between brown in summer and white in winter is driven largely by camouflage. Some arboreal mammals, notably primates and marsupials, have shades of violet, green, or blue skin on parts of their bodies, indicating some distinct advantage in their largely arboreal habitat due to convergent evolution.\nAposematism, warning off possible predators, is the most likely explanation of the black-and-white pelage of many mammals which are able to defend themselves, such as in the foul-smelling skunk and the powerful and aggressive honey badger. Coat color is sometimes sexually dimorphic, as in many primate species. Differences in female and male coat color may indicate nutrition and hormone levels, important in mate selection. Coat color may influence the ability to retain heat, depending on how much light is reflected. Mammals with a darker coloured coat can absorb more heat from solar radiation, and stay warmer, and some smaller mammals, such as voles, have darker fur in the winter. The white, pigmentless fur of arctic mammals, such as the polar bear, may reflect more solar radiation directly onto the skin. The dazzling black-and-white striping of zebras appear to provide some protection from biting flies.\nReproductive system.\nMammals reproduce by internal fertilisation and are solely gonochoric (an animal is born with either male or female genitalia, as opposed to hermaphrodites where there is no such schism). Male mammals ejaculate semen during copulation through a penis, which may be contained in a prepuce when not erect. Male placentals also urinate through a penis, and some placentals also have a penis bone (baculum). Marsupials typically have forked penises, while the echidna penis generally has four heads with only two functioning. Depending on the species, an erection may be fuelled by blood flow into vascular, spongy tissue or by muscular action. The testicles of most mammals descend into the scrotum which is typically posterior to the penis but is often anterior in marsupials. Female mammals generally have a vulva (clitoris and labia) on the outside, while the internal system contains paired oviducts, one or two uteri, one or two cervices and a vagina. Marsupials have two lateral vaginas and a medial vagina. The \"vagina\" of monotremes is better understood as a \"urogenital sinus\". The uterine systems of placentals can vary between a duplex, where there are two uteri and cervices which open into the vagina, a bipartite, where two uterine horns have a single cervix that connects to the vagina, a bicornuate, which consists where two uterine horns that are connected distally but separate medially creating a Y-shape, and a simplex, which has a single uterus.\nThe ancestral condition for mammal reproduction is the birthing of relatively undeveloped young, either through direct vivipary or a short period as soft-shelled eggs. This is likely due to the fact that the torso could not expand due to the presence of epipubic bones. The oldest demonstration of this reproductive style is with \"Kayentatherium\", which produced undeveloped perinates, but at much higher litter sizes than any modern mammal, 38 specimens. Most modern mammals are viviparous, giving birth to live young. However, the five species of monotreme, the platypus and the four species of echidna, lay eggs. The monotremes have a sex-determination system different from that of most other mammals. In particular, the sex chromosomes of a platypus are more like those of a chicken than those of a therian mammal.\nViviparous mammals are in the subclass Theria; those living today are in the marsupial and placental infraclasses. Marsupials have a short gestation period, typically shorter than its estrous cycle and generally giving birth to a number of undeveloped newborns that then undergo further development; in many species, this takes place within a pouch-like sac, the marsupium, located in the front of the mother's abdomen. This is the plesiomorphic condition among viviparous mammals; the presence of epipubic bones in all non-placentals prevents the expansion of the torso needed for full pregnancy. Even non-placental eutherians probably reproduced this way. The placentals give birth to relatively complete and developed young, usually after long gestation periods. They get their name from the placenta, which connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake. In placentals, the epipubic is either completely lost or converted into the baculum; allowing the torso to be able to expand and thus birth developed offspring. The great majority of mammals give birth multiple times during their lifespan, but a few species are semelparous.\nThe mammary glands of mammals are specialised to produce milk, the primary source of nutrition for newborns. The monotremes branched early from other mammals and do not have the teats seen in most mammals, but they do have mammary glands. The young lick the milk from a mammary patch on the mother's belly. Compared to placental mammals, the milk of marsupials changes greatly in both production rate and in nutrient composition, due to the underdeveloped young. In addition, the mammary glands have more autonomy allowing them to supply separate milks to young at different development stages. Lactose is the main sugar in placental milk while monotreme and marsupial milk is dominated by oligosaccharides. Weaning is the process in which a mammal becomes less dependent on their mother's milk and more on solid food.\nEndothermy.\nNearly all mammals are endothermic (\"warm-blooded\"). Most mammals also have hair to help keep them warm. Like birds, mammals can forage or hunt in weather and climates too cold for ectothermic (\"cold-blooded\") reptiles and insects. Endothermy requires plenty of food energy, so mammals eat more food per unit of body weight than most reptiles. Small insectivorous mammals eat prodigious amounts for their size. A rare exception, the naked mole-rat produces little metabolic heat, so it is considered an operational poikilotherm. Birds are also endothermic, so endothermy is not unique to mammals.\nSpecies lifespan.\nAmong mammals, species maximum lifespan varies significantly from one year in the yellow-sided opossum to 211 years in the oldest bowhead whale recorded. Although the underlying basis for these lifespan differences is still uncertain, numerous studies indicate that the ability to repair DNA damage is an important determinant of mammalian lifespan. In a 1974 study by Hart and Setlow, it was found that DNA excision repair capability increased systematically with species lifespan among seven mammalian species. Species lifespan was observed to be robustly correlated with the capacity to recognise DNA double-strand breaks as well as the level of the DNA repair protein Ku80. In a study of the cells from sixteen mammalian species, genes employed in DNA repair were found to be up-regulated in the longer-lived species. The cellular level of the DNA repair enzyme poly ADP ribose polymerase was found to correlate with species lifespan in a study of 13 mammalian species. Three additional studies of a variety of mammalian species also reported a correlation between species lifespan and DNA repair capability.\nLocomotion.\nTerrestrial.\nMost vertebrates are plantigrade, walking on the whole of the underside of the foot. Many mammals, such as cats and dogs, are digitigrade, walking on their toes, the greater stride length allowing more speed. Some animals such as horses are unguligrade, walking on the tips of their toes. This even further increases their stride length and thus their speed. A few mammals, namely the great apes, are also known to walk on their knuckles, at least for their front legs. Giant anteaters and platypuses are also knuckle-walkers. Some mammals are bipeds, using only two limbs for locomotion, which can be seen in, for example, humans and the great apes. Bipedal species have a larger field of vision than quadrupeds, conserve more energy and have the ability to manipulate objects with their hands, which aids in foraging. Instead of walking, some bipeds hop, such as kangaroos and kangaroo rats.\nAnimals will use different gaits for different speeds, terrain and situations. For example, horses show four natural gaits, the slowest horse gait is the walk, then there are three faster gaits which, from slowest to fastest, are the trot, the canter and the gallop. Animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally, such as for moving sideways or backwards. For example, the main human gaits are bipedal walking and running, but they employ many other gaits occasionally, including a four-legged crawl in tight spaces. Mammals show a vast range of gaits, the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion. Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence. For quadrupeds, there are three main categories: walking gaits, running gaits and leaping gaits. Walking is the most common gait, where some feet are on the ground at any given time, and found in almost all legged animals. Running is considered to occur when at some points in the stride all feet are off the ground in a moment of suspension.\nArboreal.\nArboreal animals frequently have elongated limbs that help them cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, the tip of the tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.\nAerial.\nBats are the only mammals that can truly fly. They fly through the air at a constant speed by moving their wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This generates a lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping the body in the air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole.\nThe wings of bats are much thinner and consist of more bones than those of birds, allowing bats to manoeuvre more accurately and fly with more lift and less drag. By folding the wings inwards towards their body on the upstroke, they use 35% less energy during flight than birds. The membranes are delicate, ripping easily; however, the tissue of the bat's membrane is able to regrow, such that small tears can heal quickly. The surface of their wings is equipped with touch-sensitive receptors on small bumps called Merkel cells, also found on human fingertips. These sensitive areas are different in bats, as each bump has a tiny hair in the center, making it even more sensitive and allowing the bat to detect and collect information about the air flowing over its wings, and to fly more efficiently by changing the shape of its wings in response.\nFossorial and subterranean.\nA fossorial (from Latin \"fossor\", meaning \"digger\") is an animal adapted to digging which lives primarily, but not solely, underground. Some examples are badgers, and naked mole-rats. Many rodent species are also considered fossorial because they live in burrows for most but not all of the day. Species that live exclusively underground are subterranean, and those with limited adaptations to a fossorial lifestyle sub-fossorial. Some organisms are fossorial to aid in temperature regulation while others use the underground habitat for protection from predators or for food storage.\nFossorial mammals have a fusiform body, thickest at the shoulders and tapering off at the tail and nose. Unable to see in the dark burrows, most have degenerated eyes, but degeneration varies between species; pocket gophers, for example, are only semi-fossorial and have very small yet functional eyes, in the fully fossorial marsupial mole, the eyes are degenerated and useless, \"Talpa\" moles have vestigial eyes and the Cape golden mole has a layer of skin covering the eyes. External ears flaps are also very small or absent. Truly fossorial mammals have short, stout legs as strength is more important than speed to a burrowing mammal, but semi-fossorial mammals have cursorial legs. The front paws are broad and have strong claws to help in loosening dirt while excavating burrows, and the back paws have webbing, as well as claws, which aids in throwing loosened dirt backwards. Most have large incisors to prevent dirt from flying into their mouth.\nMany fossorial mammals such as shrews, hedgehogs, and moles were classified under the now obsolete order Insectivora.\nAquatic.\nFully aquatic mammals, the cetaceans and sirenians, have lost their legs and have a tail fin to propel themselves through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. Whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from turning upside-down in the water. The flukes of sirenians are raised up and down in long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing.\nSemi-aquatic mammals, like pinnipeds, have two pairs of flippers on the front and back, the fore-flippers and hind-flippers. The elbows and ankles are enclosed within the body. Pinnipeds have several adaptions for reducing drag. In addition to their streamlined bodies, they have smooth networks of muscle bundles in their skin that may increase laminar flow and make it easier for them to slip through water. They also lack arrector pili, so their fur can be streamlined as they swim. They rely on their fore-flippers for locomotion in a wing-like manner similar to penguins and sea turtles. Fore-flipper movement is not continuous, and the animal glides between each stroke. Compared to terrestrial carnivorans, the fore-limbs are reduced in length, which gives the locomotor muscles at the shoulder and elbow joints greater mechanical advantage; the hind-flippers serve as stabilizers. Other semi-aquatic mammals include beavers, hippopotamuses, otters and platypuses. Hippos are very large semi-aquatic mammals, and their barrel-shaped bodies have graviportal skeletal structures, adapted to carrying their enormous weight, and their specific gravity allows them to sink and move along the bottom of a river.\nBehavior.\nCommunication and vocalisation.\nMany mammals communicate by vocalising. Vocal communication serves many purposes, including in mating rituals, as warning calls, to indicate food sources, and for social purposes. Males often call during mating rituals to ward off other males and to attract females, as in the roaring of lions and red deer. The songs of the humpback whale may be signals to females; they have different dialects in different regions of the ocean. Social vocalisations include the territorial calls of gibbons, and the use of frequency in greater spear-nosed bats to distinguish between groups. The vervet monkey gives a distinct alarm call for each of at least four different predators, and the reactions of other monkeys vary according to the call. For example, if an alarm call signals a python, the monkeys climb into the trees, whereas the eagle alarm causes monkeys to seek a hiding place on the ground. Prairie dogs similarly have complex calls that signal the type, size, and speed of an approaching predator. Elephants communicate socially with a variety of sounds including snorting, screaming, trumpeting, roaring and rumbling. Some of the rumbling calls are infrasonic, below the hearing range of humans, and can be heard by other elephants up to away at still times near sunrise and sunset.\nMammals signal by a variety of means. Many give visual anti-predator signals, as when deer and gazelle stot, honestly indicating their fit condition and their ability to escape, or when white-tailed deer and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected. Many mammals make use of scent-marking, sometimes possibly to help defend territory, but probably with a range of functions both within and between species. Microbats and toothed whales including oceanic dolphins vocalise both socially and in echolocation.\nFeeding.\nTo maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive\u2014mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways. Some eat other animals\u2014this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants, which contain complex carbohydrates such as cellulose. An herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as granivory (seed eating), folivory (leaf eating), frugivory (fruit eating), nectarivory (nectar eating), gummivory (gum eating) and mycophagy (fungus eating). The digestive tract of an herbivore is host to bacteria that ferment these complex substances, and make them available for digestion, which are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. Some mammals are coprophagous, consuming feces to absorb the nutrients not digested when the food was first ingested. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract because the proteins, lipids and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialised digestion. Exceptions to this include baleen whales who also house gut flora in a multi-chambered stomach, like terrestrial herbivores.\nThe size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type (Allen's rule). Since small mammals have a high ratio of heat-losing surface area to heat-generating volume, they tend to have high energy requirements and a high metabolic rate. Mammals that weigh less than about are mostly insectivorous because they cannot tolerate the slow, complex digestive process of an herbivore. Larger animals, on the other hand, generate more heat and less of this heat is lost. They can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process (carnivores that feed on larger vertebrates) or a slower digestive process (herbivores). Furthermore, mammals that weigh more than usually cannot collect enough insects during their waking hours to sustain themselves. The only large insectivorous mammals are those that feed on huge colonies of insects (ants or termites).\nSome mammals are omnivores and display varying degrees of carnivory and herbivory, generally leaning in favour of one more than the other. Since plants and meat are digested differently, there is a preference for one over the other, as in bears where some species may be mostly carnivorous and others mostly herbivorous. They are grouped into three categories: mesocarnivory (50\u201370% meat), hypercarnivory (70% and greater of meat), and hypocarnivory (50% or less of meat). The dentition of hypocarnivores consists of dull, triangular carnassial teeth meant for grinding food. Hypercarnivores, however, have conical teeth and sharp carnassials meant for slashing, and in some cases strong jaws for bone-crushing, as in the case of hyenas, allowing them to consume bones; some extinct groups, notably the Machairodontinae, had sabre-shaped canines.\nSome physiological carnivores consume plant matter and some physiological herbivores consume meat. From a behavioural aspect, this would make them omnivores, but from the physiological standpoint, this may be due to zoopharmacognosy. Physiologically, animals must be able to obtain both energy and nutrients from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous. Thus, such animals are still able to be classified as carnivores and herbivores when they are just obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification. For example, it is well documented that some ungulates such as giraffes, camels, and cattle, will gnaw on bones to consume particular minerals and nutrients. Also, cats, which are generally regarded as obligate carnivores, occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestible material (such as hairballs), aid with haemoglobin production, and as a laxative.\nMany mammals, in the absence of sufficient food requirements in an environment, suppress their metabolism and conserve energy in a process known as hibernation. In the period preceding hibernation, larger mammals, such as bears, become polyphagic to increase fat stores, whereas smaller mammals prefer to collect and stash food. The slowing of the metabolism is accompanied by a decreased heart and respiratory rate, as well as a drop in internal temperatures, which can be around ambient temperature in some cases. For example, the internal temperatures of hibernating Arctic ground squirrels can drop to ; however, the head and neck always stay above . A few mammals in hot environments aestivate in times of drought or extreme heat, for example the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (\"Cheirogaleus medius\").\nIntelligence.\nIn intelligent mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum is larger relative to the rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioural flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonise a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.\nTool use by animals may indicate different levels of learning and cognition. The sea otter uses rocks as essential and regular parts of its foraging behaviour (smashing abalone from rocks or breaking open shells), with some populations spending 21% of their time making tools. Other tool use, such as chimpanzees using twigs to \"fish\" for termites, may be developed by watching others use tools and may even be a true example of animal teaching. Tools may even be used in solving puzzles in which the animal appears to experience a \"Eureka moment\". Other mammals that do not use tools, such as dogs, can also experience a Eureka moment.\nBrain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. Allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443 or &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444 exponent of the body mass. Comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an encephalisation quotient that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence. Sperm whales have the largest brain mass of any animal on earth, averaging and in mature males.\nSelf-awareness appears to be a sign of abstract thinking. Self-awareness, although not well-defined, is believed to be a precursor to more advanced processes such as metacognitive reasoning. The traditional method for measuring this is the mirror test, which determines if an animal possesses the ability of self-recognition. Mammals that have passed the mirror test include Asian elephants (some pass, some do not); chimpanzees; bonobos; orangutans; humans, from 18 months (mirror stage); common bottlenose dolphins; orcas; and false killer whales.\nSocial structure.\nEusociality is the highest level of social organisation. These societies have an overlap of adult generations, the division of reproductive labour and cooperative caring of young. Usually insects, such as bees, ants and termites, have eusocial behaviour, but it is demonstrated in two rodent species: the naked mole-rat and the Damaraland mole-rat.\nPresociality is when animals exhibit more than just sexual interactions with members of the same species, but fall short of qualifying as eusocial. That is, presocial animals can display communal living, cooperative care of young, or primitive division of reproductive labour, but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals. Humans and some species of Callitrichidae (marmosets and tamarins) are unique among primates in their degree of cooperative care of young. Harry Harlow set up an experiment with rhesus monkeys, presocial primates, in 1958; the results from this study showed that social encounters are necessary in order for the young monkeys to develop both mentally and sexually.\nA fission\u2013fusion society is a society that changes frequently in its size and composition, making up a permanent social group called the \"parent group\". Permanent social networks consist of all individual members of a community and often varies to track changes in their environment. In a fission\u2013fusion society, the main parent group can fracture (fission) into smaller stable subgroups or individuals to adapt to environmental or social circumstances. For example, a number of males may break off from the main group in order to hunt or forage for food during the day, but at night they may return to join (fusion) the primary group to share food and partake in other activities. Many mammals exhibit this, such as primates (for example orangutans and spider monkeys), elephants, spotted hyenas, lions, and dolphins.\nSolitary animals defend a territory and avoid social interactions with the members of its species, except during breeding season. This is to avoid resource competition, as two individuals of the same species would occupy the same niche, and to prevent depletion of food. A solitary animal, while foraging, can also be less conspicuous to predators or prey.\nIn a hierarchy, individuals are either dominant or submissive. A despotic hierarchy is where one individual is dominant while the others are submissive, as in wolves and lemurs, and a pecking order is a linear ranking of individuals where there is a top individual and a bottom individual. Pecking orders may also be ranked by sex, where the lowest individual of a sex has a higher ranking than the top individual of the other sex, as in hyenas. Dominant individuals, or alphas, have a high chance of reproductive success, especially in harems where one or a few males (resident males) have exclusive breeding rights to females in a group. Non-resident males can also be accepted in harems, but some species, such as the common vampire bat (\"Desmodus rotundus\"), may be more strict.\nSome mammals are perfectly monogamous, meaning that they mate for life and take no other partners (even after the original mate's death), as with wolves, Eurasian beavers, and otters. There are three types of polygamy: either one or multiple dominant males have breeding rights (polygyny), multiple males that females mate with (polyandry), or multiple males have exclusive relations with multiple females (polygynandry). It is much more common for polygynous mating to happen, which, excluding leks, are estimated to occur in up to 90% of mammals. Lek mating occurs when males congregate around females and try to attract them with various courtship displays and vocalisations, as in harbour seals.\nAll higher mammals (excluding monotremes) share two major adaptations for care of the young: live birth and lactation. These imply a group-wide choice of a degree of parental care. They may build nests and dig burrows to raise their young in, or feed and guard them often for a prolonged period of time. Many mammals are K-selected, and invest more time and energy into their young than do r-selected animals. When two animals mate, they both share an interest in the success of the offspring, though often to different extremes. Mammalian females exhibit some degree of maternal aggression, another example of parental care, which may be targeted against other females of the species or the young of other females; however, some mammals may \"aunt\" the infants of other females, and care for them. Mammalian males may play a role in child rearing, as with tenrecs, however this varies species to species, even within the same genus. For example, the males of the southern pig-tailed macaque (\"Macaca nemestrina\") do not participate in child care, whereas the males of the Japanese macaque (\"M. fuscata\") do.\nHumans and other mammals.\nIn human culture.\nNon-human mammals play a wide variety of roles in human culture. They are the most popular of pets, with tens of millions of dogs, cats and other animals including rabbits and mice kept by families around the world. Mammals such as mammoths, horses and deer are among the earliest subjects of art, being found in Upper Paleolithic cave paintings such as at Lascaux. Major artists such as Albrecht D\u00fcrer, George Stubbs and Edwin Landseer are known for their portraits of mammals. Many species of mammals have been hunted for sport and for food; deer and wild boar are especially popular as game animals. Mammals such as horses and dogs are widely raced for sport, often combined with betting on the outcome. There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with rights of their own. Mammals further play a wide variety of roles in literature, film, mythology, and religion.\nUses and importance.\nThe domestication of mammals was instrumental in the Neolithic development of agriculture and of civilisation, causing farmers to replace hunter-gatherers around the world. This transition from hunting and gathering to herding flocks and growing crops was a major step in human history. The new agricultural economies, based on domesticated mammals, caused \"radical restructuring of human societies, worldwide alterations in biodiversity, and significant changes in the Earth's landforms and its atmosphere... momentous outcomes\".\nDomestic mammals form a large part of the livestock raised for meat across the world. They include (2009) around 1.4\u00a0billion cattle, 1\u00a0billion sheep, 1\u00a0billion domestic pigs, and (1985) over 700\u00a0million rabbits. Working domestic animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the origins of agriculture, their numbers declining with the arrival of mechanised transport and agricultural machinery. In 2004 they still provided some 80% of the power for the mainly small farms in the third world, and some 20% of the world's transport, again mainly in rural areas. In mountainous regions unsuitable for wheeled vehicles, pack animals continue to transport goods. Mammal skins provide leather for shoes, clothing and upholstery. Wool from mammals including sheep, goats and alpacas has been used for centuries for clothing.\nMammals serve a major role in science as experimental animals, both in fundamental biological research, such as in genetics, and in the development of new medicines, which must be tested exhaustively to demonstrate their safety. Millions of mammals, especially mice and rats, are used in experiments each year. A knockout mouse is a genetically modified mouse with an inactivated gene, replaced or disrupted with an artificial piece of DNA. They enable the study of sequenced genes whose functions are unknown. A small percentage of the mammals are non-human primates, used in research for their similarity to humans.\nDespite the benefits domesticated mammals had for human development, humans have an increasingly detrimental effect on wild mammals across the world. It has been estimated that the mass of all \"wild\" mammals has declined to only 4% of all mammals, with 96% of mammals being humans and their livestock now (see figure). In fact, terrestrial wild mammals make up only 2% of all mammals.\nHybrids.\nHybrids are offspring resulting from the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually will result in a high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous. The deliberate or accidental hybridising of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown for economic purposes. Hybrids between different subspecies within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are known as interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids. Natural hybrids will occur in hybrid zones, where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in the same or adjacent areas will interbreed with each other. Some hybrids have been recognised as species, such as the red wolf (though this is controversial).\nArtificial selection, the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals, is being used to breed back recently extinct animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that resembles that extinct wildtype ancestor. A breeding-back (intraspecific) hybrid may be very similar to the extinct wildtype in appearance, ecological niche and to some extent genetics, but the initial gene pool of that wild type is lost forever with its extinction. As a result, bred-back breeds are at best vague look-alikes of extinct wildtypes, as Heck cattle are of the aurochs.\nPurebred wild species evolved to a specific ecology can be threatened with extinction through the process of genetic pollution, the uncontrolled hybridisation, introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenisation or out-competition from the heterosic hybrid species. When new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact, extinction in some species, especially rare varieties, is possible. Interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool. For example, the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the domestic water buffalo. Such extinctions are not always apparent from a morphological standpoint. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionary process, nevertheless, hybridisation threatens the existence of rare species.\nThreats.\nThe loss of species from ecological communities, defaunation, is primarily driven by human activity. This has resulted in empty forests, ecological communities depleted of large vertebrates. In the Quaternary extinction event, the mass die-off of megafaunal variety coincided with the appearance of humans, suggesting a human influence. One hypothesis is that humans hunted large mammals, such as the woolly mammoth, into extinction. The 2019 \"Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\" by IPBES states that the total biomass of wild mammals has declined by 82 per cent since the beginning of human civilisation. Wild animals make up just 4% of mammalian biomass on earth, while humans and their domesticated animals make up 96%.\nVarious species are predicted to become extinct in the near future, among them the rhinoceros, giraffes, and species of primates and pangolins. According to the WWF's 2020 \"Living Planet Report\", vertebrate wildlife populations have declined by 68% since 1970 as a result of human activities, particularly overconsumption, population growth and intensive farming, which is evidence that humans have triggered a sixth mass extinction event. Hunting alone threatens hundreds of mammalian species around the world. Scientists claim that the growing demand for meat is contributing to biodiversity loss as this is a significant driver of deforestation and habitat destruction; species-rich habitats, such as significant portions of the Amazon rainforest, are being converted to agricultural land for meat production. Another influence is over-hunting and poaching, which can reduce the overall population of game animals, especially those located near villages, as in the case of peccaries. The effects of poaching can especially be seen in the ivory trade with African elephants. Marine mammals are at risk from entanglement from fishing gear, notably cetaceans, with discard mortalities ranging from 65,000 to 86,000 individuals annually.\nAttention is being given to endangered species globally, notably through the Convention on Biological Diversity, otherwise known as the Rio Accord, which includes 189 signatory countries that are focused on identifying endangered species and habitats. Another notable conservation organisation is the IUCN, which has a membership of over 1,200 governmental and non-governmental organisations.\nRecent extinctions can be directly attributed to human influences. The IUCN characterises 'recent' extinction as those that have occurred past the cut-off point of 1500, and around 80 mammal species have gone extinct since that time and 2015. Some species, such as the P\u00e8re David's deer are extinct in the wild, and survive solely in captive populations. Other species, such as the Florida panther, are ecologically extinct, surviving in such low numbers that they essentially have no impact on the ecosystem. Other populations are only locally extinct (extirpated), still existing elsewhere, but reduced in distribution, as with the extinction of grey whales in the Atlantic.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18839", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18839", "title": "Music", "text": "Form of art using sound\nMusic is the arrangement of sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise expressive content. Music is generally agreed to be a cultural universal that is present in all human societies. Definitions of music vary widely in substance and approach. While scholars agree that music is defined by a small number of specific elements, there is no consensus as to what these necessary elements are. Music is often characterized as a highly versatile medium for expressing human creativity. Diverse activities are involved in the creation of music, and are often divided into categories of composition, improvisation, and performance. Music may be performed using a wide variety of musical instruments, including the human voice. It can also be composed, sequenced, or otherwise produced to be indirectly played mechanically or electronically, such as via a music box, barrel organ, or digital audio workstation software on a computer.\nMusic often plays a key role in social events and religious ceremonies. The techniques of making music are often transmitted as part of a cultural tradition. Music is played in public and private contexts, highlighted at events such as festivals and concerts for various different types of ensembles. Music is used in the production of other media, such as in soundtracks to films, TV shows, operas, and video games.\nListening to music is a common means of entertainment. The culture surrounding music extends into areas of academic study, journalism, philosophy, psychology, and therapy. The music industry includes songwriters, performers, sound engineers, producers, tour organizers, distributors of instruments, accessories, and publishers of sheet music and recordings. Technology facilitating the recording and reproduction of music has historically included sheet music, microphones, phonographs, and tape machines, with playback of digital music being a common use for MP3 players, CD players, and smartphones.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology and terminology.\nThe modern English word \"music\" came into use in the 1630s. It descends from Middle English , which in turn descends from Old French , then Latin \u2014and ultimately from Ancient Greek (), a phrase meaning \"art of the Muses\". The Muses were nine deities in Ancient Greek mythology who presided over the arts and sciences. They were included in tales by the earliest Western authors, Homer and Hesiod, and eventually came to be associated with music specifically. Over time, Polyhymnia would reside over music more prominently than the other muses. The Latin word was also the originator for both the Spanish and French via spelling and linguistic adjustment, though other European terms were probably loanwords, including the Italian , German , Dutch , Norwegian , Polish and Russian .\nThe modern Western world usually defines music as an all-encompassing term used to describe diverse genres, styles, and traditions. This is not the case worldwide, and languages such as modern Indonesian () and Shona () have recently adopted words to reflect this universal conception, as they did not have words that fit exactly the Western scope. Before Western contact in East Asia, neither Japan nor China had a single word that encompasses music in a broad sense, but culturally, they often regarded music in such a fashion. The closest word to mean music in Chinese, , shares a character with , meaning joy, and originally referred to all the arts before narrowing in meaning. Africa is too diverse to make firm generalizations, but the musicologist J. H. Kwabena Nketia has emphasized African music's often inseparable connection to dance and speech in general. Some African cultures, such as the Songye people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Tiv people of Nigeria, have a strong and broad conception of 'music' but no corresponding word in their native languages. Other words commonly translated as \"music\" often have more specific meanings in their respective cultures: the Hindi word for music, , properly refers to art music, while the many Indigenous languages of the Americas have words for music that refer specifically to song but describe instrumental music regardless. Though the Arabic can refer to all music, it is usually used for instrumental and metric music, while identifies vocal and improvised music.\nHistory.\nOrigins and prehistory.\nIt is often debated to what extent the origins of music will ever be understood, and there are competing theories that aim to explain it. Many scholars highlight a relationship between the origin of music and the origin of language, and there is disagreement surrounding whether music developed before, after, or simultaneously with language. A similar source of contention surrounds whether music was the intentional result of natural selection or was a byproduct spandrel of evolution. The earliest influential theory was proposed by Charles Darwin in 1871, who stated that music arose as a form of sexual selection, perhaps via mating calls. Darwin's original perspective has been heavily criticized for its inconsistencies with other sexual selection methods, though many scholars in the 21st century have developed and promoted the theory. Other theories include that music arose to assist in organizing labor, improving long-distance communication, benefiting communication with the divine, assisting in community cohesion or as a defense to scare off predators.\nPrehistoric music can only be theorized based on findings from paleolithic archaeology sites. The disputed Divje Babe flute, a perforated cave bear femur, is at least 40,000 years old, though there is considerable debate surrounding whether it is truly a musical instrument or an object formed by animals. The earliest objects whose designations as musical instruments are widely accepted are bone flutes from the Swabian Jura, Germany, namely from the Geissenkl\u00f6sterle, Hohle Fels and Vogelherd caves. Dated to the Aurignacian (of the Upper Paleolithic) and used by Early European modern humans, from all three caves there are eight examples, four made from the wing bones of birds and four from mammoth ivory; three of these are near complete. Three flutes from the Geissenkl\u00f6sterle are dated as the oldest, c.\u200943,150\u201339,370 BP.\nAntiquity.\nThe earliest material and representational evidence of Egyptian musical instruments dates to the Predynastic period, but the evidence is more securely attested in the Old Kingdom when harps, flutes and double clarinets were played. Percussion instruments, lyres, and lutes were added to orchestras by the Middle Kingdom. Cymbals frequently accompanied music and dance, much as they still do in Egypt today. Egyptian folk music, including the traditional Sufi rituals, are the closest contemporary music genre to ancient Egyptian music, having preserved many of its features, rhythms and instruments.\nThe \"Hurrian Hymn to Nikkal\", found on clay tablets in the ancient Syrian city of Ugarit, is the oldest surviving notated work of music, dating back to approximately 1400\u00a0BCE.\nMusic was an important part of social and cultural life in ancient Greece, in fact it was one of the main subjects taught to children. Musical education was considered important for the development of an individual's soul. Musicians and singers played a prominent role in Greek theater, and those who received a musical education were seen as nobles and in perfect harmony (as can be read in the Republic, Plato). Mixed gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration, and spiritual ceremonies. Instruments included the double-reed and a plucked string instrument, the \"lyre\", principally a special kind called a . Music was an important part of education, and boys were taught music starting at age six. Greek musical literacy created significant musical development. Greek music theory included the Greek musical modes, that eventually became the basis for Western religious and classical music. Later, influences from the Roman Empire, Eastern Europe, and the Byzantine Empire changed Greek music. The Seikilos epitaph is the oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition, including musical notation, from anywhere in the world. The oldest surviving work written about music theory is \"Harmonika Stoicheia\" by Aristoxenus.\nAsian cultures.\nAsian music covers a swath of music cultures surveyed in the articles on Arabia, Central Asia, East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. These traditions, with several reaching into antiquity, share historical ties through trade, religion and philosophical exchange, yet preserve their unique local aesthetics and performance styles.\nIndian classical music is one of the oldest musical traditions in the world. Sculptures from the Indus Valley civilization show dance and old musical instruments, like the seven-holed flute. Stringed instruments and drums have been recovered from Harappa and Mohenjo Daro by excavations carried out by Mortimer Wheeler. The Rigveda, an ancient Hindu text, has elements of present Indian music, with musical notation to denote the meter and mode of chanting. Indian classical music (marga) is monophonic, and based on a single melody line or raga rhythmically organized through talas. The poem \"Cilappatikaram\" provides information about how new scales can be formed by modal shifting of the tonic from an existing scale. Present day Hindi music was influenced by Persian traditional music and Afghan Mughals. Carnatic music, popular in the southern states, is largely devotional; the majority of the songs are addressed to the Hindu deities. There are songs emphasizing love and other social issues.\nIndonesian music has been formed since the Bronze Age culture migrated to the Indonesian archipelago in the 2nd-3rd centuries BCE. Indonesian traditional music uses percussion instruments, especially kendang and gongs. Some of them developed elaborate and distinctive instruments, such as the sasando stringed instrument on the island of Rote, the Sundanese angklung, and the complex and sophisticated Javanese and Balinese gamelan orchestras. Indonesia is the home of gong chime, a general term for a set of small, high pitched pot gongs. Gongs are usually placed in order of note, with the boss up on a string held in a low wooden frame. The most popular form of Indonesian music is gamelan, an ensemble of tuned percussion instruments that include metallophones, drums, gongs and spike fiddles along with bamboo suling (like a flute).\nChinese classical music, the traditional art or court music of China, has a history stretching over about 3,000 years. It has its own unique systems of musical notation, as well as musical tuning and pitch, musical instruments and styles or genres. Chinese music is pentatonic-diatonic, having a scale of twelve notes to an octave (5\u00a0+\u00a07\u00a0=\u00a012) as does European-influenced music.\nWestern classical.\nEarly music.\nThe medieval music era (500 to 1400), which took place during the Middle Ages, started with the introduction of monophonic (single melodic line) chanting into Catholic Church services. Musical notation was used since ancient times in Greek culture, but in the Middle Ages, notation was first introduced by the Catholic Church, so chant melodies could be written down, to facilitate the use of the same melodies for religious music across the Catholic empire. The only European Medieval repertory that has been found, in written form, from before 800 is the monophonic liturgical plainsong chant of the Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called Gregorian chant. Alongside these traditions of sacred and church music there existed a vibrant tradition of secular song (non-religious songs). Examples of composers from this period are L\u00e9onin, P\u00e9rotin, Guillaume de Machaut, and Walther von der Vogelweide.\nRenaissance music (c.\u20091400 to 1600) was more focused on secular themes, such as courtly love. Around 1450, the printing press was invented, which made printed sheet music much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music spread musical styles quicker and across a larger area. Musicians and singers often worked for the church, courts and towns. Church choirs grew in size, and the church remained an important patron of music. By the middle of the 15th century, composers wrote richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include Guillaume Du Fay, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Thomas Morley, Orlando di Lasso and Josquin des Prez. As musical activity shifted from the church to aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and France; they are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.\nCommon practice period.\nBaroque.\nThe Baroque era of music took place from 1600 to 1750, coinciding with the flourishing of the Baroque artistic style in Europe. The start of the Baroque era was marked by the penning of the first operas. Polyphonic contrapuntal music (music with separate, simultaneous melodic lines) remained important during this period. German Baroque composers wrote for small ensembles including strings, brass, and woodwinds, as well as for choirs and keyboard instruments such as pipe organ, harpsichord, and clavichord. Musical complexity increased during this time. Several major musical forms were created, some of them which persisted into later periods, seeing further development. These include the fugue, the invention, the sonata, and the concerto. The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach (\"Cello suites\"), George Frideric Handel (\"Messiah\"), Georg Philipp Telemann and Antonio Vivaldi (\"The Four Seasons\").\nClassicism.\nThe music of the Classical period (1730 to 1820) aimed to imitate what were seen as the key elements of the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome: the ideals of balance, proportion and disciplined expression. (Note: the music from the Classical period should not be confused with Classical music in general, a term which refers to Western art music from the 5th century to the 2000s, which includes the Classical period as one of a number of periods). Music from the Classical period has a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture than the Baroque music which preceded it. The main style was homophony, where a prominent melody and a subordinate chordal accompaniment part are clearly distinct. Classical instrumental melodies tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed, and the fortepiano, the forerunner to the modern piano, replaced the Baroque era harpsichord and pipe organ as the main keyboard instrument (though pipe organ continued to be used in sacred music, such as Masses).\nImportance was given to instrumental music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the sonata, the concerto, and the symphony. Other main kinds were the trio, string quartet, serenade and divertimento. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata. The instruments used chamber music and orchestra became more standardized. In place of the basso continuo group of the Baroque era, which consisted of harpsichord, organ or lute along with a number of bass instruments selected at the discretion of the group leader (e.g., viol, cello, theorbo, serpent), Classical chamber groups used specified, standardized instruments (e.g., a string quartet would be performed by two violins, a viola and a cello). The practice of improvised chord-playing by the continuo keyboardist or lute player, a hallmark of Baroque music, underwent a gradual decline between 1750 and 1800.\nOne of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to ballet and mixed vocal/instrumental genres, such as opera and oratorio, became more popular.\nThe best known composers of Classicism are Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Christoph Willibald Gluck, Johann Christian Bach, Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.\nRomanticism.\nRomantic music (c.\u20091820 to 1900) from the 19th century had many elements in common with the Romantic styles in literature and painting of the era. Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature. Romantic music expanded beyond the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces and songs. Romantic composers such as Wagner and Brahms attempted to increase emotional expression and power in their music to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic tone poems, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted nationalistic pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by folk music. The emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over tradition.\nRomantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the syncretism of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as literature), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. Romantic love or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases, the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the sonata form used in string quartets and symphonies), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, new approaches were explored for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. Composers continued to develop opera and ballet music, exploring new styles and themes.\nIn the years after 1800, the music developed by Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short motifs, developed organically, came to replace melody as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his Fifth Symphony). Later Romantic composers such as Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, and Gustav Mahler used more unusual chords and more dissonance to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic chromatic alterations of tonality, such as extended chords and altered chords, which created new sound \"colors.\" The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra, and the Industrial Revolution helped to create better instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Public concerts became an important part of well-to-do urban society. It also saw a new diversity in theatre music, including operetta, and musical comedy and other forms of musical theatre.\n20th and 21st century.\nIn the 19th century, a key way new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of sheet music, which middle class amateur music lovers would perform at home, on their piano or other common instruments, such as the violin. With 20th-century music, the invention of new electric technologies such as radio broadcasting and mass market availability of gramophone records meant sound recordings heard by listeners (on the radio or record player) became the main way to learn about new songs and pieces. There was a vast increase in music listening as the radio gained popularity and phonographs were used to replay and distribute music; anyone with a radio or record player could hear operas, symphonies and big bands in their own living room. During the 19th century, the focus on sheet music had restricted access to new music to middle and upper-class people who could read music and who owned pianos and other instruments. Radios and record players allowed lower-income people, who could not afford an opera or symphony concert ticket, to hear this music. As well, people could hear music from different parts of the country, or even different parts of the world, even if they could not afford to travel to these locations. This helped to spread musical styles.\nThe focus of art music in the 20th century was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. The horrors of World War I influenced many of the arts, including music, and composers began exploring darker, harsher sounds. Traditional music styles such as jazz and folk music were used by composers as a source of ideas for classical music. Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg, and John Cage were influential composers in 20th-century art music. The invention of sound recording and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenres of classical music, including the acousmatic and musique concr\u00e8te schools of electronic composition. Sound recording was a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The introduction of the multitrack recording system had a major influence on rock music, because it could do more than record a band's performance. Using a multitrack system, a band and their music producer could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.\nJazz evolved and became an important genre of music over the course of the 20th century, and during the second half, rock music did the same. Jazz is an American musical artform that originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of African and European music traditions. The style's West African pedigree is evident in its use of blue notes, improvisation, polyrhythms, syncopation, and the swung note.\nRock music is a genre of popular music that developed in the 1950s from rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, and country music. The sound of rock often revolves around the electric or acoustic guitar, and it uses a strong back beat laid down by a rhythm section. Along with the guitar or keyboards, saxophone and blues-style harmonica are used as soloing instruments. In its \"purest form\", it \"has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody.\" The traditional rhythm section for popular music is rhythm guitar, electric bass guitar, drums. Some bands have keyboard instruments such as organ, piano, or, since the 1970s, analog synthesizers. In the 1980s, pop musicians began using digital synthesizers, such as the DX-7 synthesizer, electronic drum machines such as the TR-808 and synth bass devices (such as the TB-303) or synth bass keyboards. In the 1990s, an increasingly large range of computerized hardware musical devices and instruments and software (e.g. digital audio workstations) were used. In the 2020s, soft synths and computer music apps make it possible for bedroom producers to create and record types of music, such as electronic dance music, in their home, adding sampled and digital instruments and editing the recording digitally. In the 1990s, bands in genres such as nu metal began including DJs in their bands. DJs create music by manipulating recorded music, using a DJ mixer.\nCreation.\nComposition.\n\"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song, an instrumental music piece, a work with both singing and instruments, or another type of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing also includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other singers or musicians. In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called songwriting, may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, the composer typically orchestrates his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead, compose the song in her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music.\nEven when music is notated relatively precisely, as in classical music, there are many decisions that a performer has to make, because notation does not specify all of the elements of music precisely. The process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed \"interpretation\". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or phrasing of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting their songs, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as performance practice, whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.\nAlthough a musical composition often uses musical notation and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in popular music when a band collaborates to write a song, or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics, and a third person orchestrates the songs. In some styles of music, such as the blues, a composer/songwriter may create, perform and record new songs or pieces without ever writing them down in music notation. A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from avant-garde music that uses graphic notation, to text compositions such as \"Aus den sieben Tagen\", to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called aleatoric music, and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as John Cage, Morton Feldman, and Witold Lutos\u0142awski. A commonly known example of chance-based music is the sound of wind chimes jingling in a breeze.\nThe study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of popular music and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces as well as spontaneously improvised works like those of free jazz performers and African percussionists such as Ewe drummers.\nPerformance.\nPerformance is the physical expression of music, which occurs when a song is sung or piano piece, guitar melody, symphony, drum beat or other musical part is played. In classical music, a work is written in music notation by a composer and then performed once the composer is satisfied with its structure and instrumentation. However, as it gets performed, the interpretation of a song or piece can evolve and change. In classical music, instrumental performers, singers or conductors may gradually make changes to the phrasing or tempo of a piece. In popular and traditional music, the performers have more freedom to make changes to the form of a song or piece. As such, in popular and traditional music styles, even when a band plays a cover song, they can make changes such as adding a guitar solo or inserting an introduction.\nA performance can either be planned out and rehearsed (practiced)\u2014which is the norm in classical music, jazz big bands, and many popular music styles\u2013or improvised over a chord progression (a sequence of chords), which is the norm in small jazz and blues groups. Rehearsals of orchestras, concert bands and choirs are led by a conductor. Rock, blues and jazz bands are usually led by the bandleader. A rehearsal is a structured repetition of a song or piece by the performers until it can be sung or played correctly and, if it is a song or piece for more than one musician, until the parts are together from a rhythmic and tuning perspective.\nMany cultures have strong traditions of solo performance (in which one singer or instrumentalist performs), such as in Indian classical music, and in the Western art-music tradition. Other cultures, such as in Bali, include strong traditions of group performance. All cultures include a mixture of both, and performance may range from improvised solo playing to highly planned and organized performances such as the modern classical concert, religious processions, classical music festivals or music competitions. Chamber music, which is music for a small ensemble with only one or a few of each type of instrument, is often seen as more intimate than large symphonic works.\nImprovisation.\nMusical improvisation is the creation of spontaneous music, often within (or based on) a pre-existing harmonic framework, chord progression, or riffs. Improvisers use the notes of the chord, various scales that are associated with each chord, and chromatic ornaments and passing tones which may be neither chord tones nor from the typical scales associated with a chord. Musical improvisation can be done with or without preparation. Improvisation is a major part of some types of music, such as blues, jazz, and jazz fusion, in which instrumental performers improvise solos, melody lines, and accompaniment parts.\nIn the Western art music tradition, improvisation was an important skill during the Baroque era and during the Classical era. In the Baroque era, performers improvised ornaments, and basso continuo keyboard players improvised chord voicings based on figured bass notation. As well, the top soloists were expected to be able to improvise pieces such as preludes. In the Classical era, solo performers and singers improvised virtuoso cadenzas during concerts.\nHowever, in the 20th and early 21st century, as \"common practice\" Western art music performance became institutionalized in symphony orchestras, opera houses, and ballets, improvisation has played a smaller role, as more and more music was notated in scores and parts for musicians to play. At the same time, some 20th and 21st century art music composers have increasingly included improvisation in their creative work. In Indian classical music, improvisation is a core component and an essential criterion of performances.\nArt and entertainment.\nMusic is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was only available through sheet music scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the sheet music of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano. With the advent of the phonograph, records of popular songs, rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy their favourite songs. With the advent of home tape recorders in the 1980s and digital music in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or playlists of favourite songs and take them with them on a portable cassette player or MP3 player. Some music lovers create mix tapes of favourite songs, which serve as a \"self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription for an ideal party... [and] an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved\".\nAmateur musicians can compose or perform music for their own pleasure and derive income elsewhere. Professional musicians are employed by institutions and organisations, including armed forces (in marching bands, concert bands and popular music groups), religious institutions, symphony orchestras, broadcasting or film production companies, and music schools. Professional musicians sometimes work as freelancers or session musicians, seeking contracts and engagements in a variety of settings. There are often many links between amateur and professional musicians. Beginning amateur musicians take lessons with professional musicians. In community settings, advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians in a variety of ensembles such as community concert bands and community orchestras.\nA distinction is often made between music performed for a live audience and music that is performed in a studio so that it can be recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is also recorded and distributed. Live concert recordings are popular in both classical music and in popular music forms such as rock, where illegally taped live concerts are prized by music lovers. In the jam band scene, live, improvised jam sessions are preferred to studio recordings.\nNotation.\nMusic notation typically means the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music, such as the notes of a melody, are notated. Music notation often provides instructions on how to perform the music. For example, the sheet music for a song may state the song is a \"slow blues\" or a \"fast swing\", which indicates the tempo and the genre. To read notation, a person must have an understanding of music theory, harmony and the performance practice associated with a particular song or piece's genre.\nWritten notation varies with the style and period of music. Nowadays, notated music is produced as sheet music or, for individuals with computer scorewriter programs, as an image on a computer screen. In ancient times, music notation was put onto stone or clay tablets. To perform music from notation, a singer or instrumentalist requires an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or genre. In genres requiring musical improvisation, the performer often plays from music where only the chord changes and form of the song are written, requiring the performer to have a great understanding of the music's structure, harmony and the styles of a particular genre e.g., jazz or country music.\nIn Western art music, the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the standard musical notation is the lead sheet, which notates the melody, chords, lyrics (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. Fake books are also used in jazz; they may consist of lead sheets or simply chord charts, which permit rhythm section members to improvise an accompaniment part to jazz songs. Scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such as jazz \"big bands.\" In popular music, guitarists and electric bass players often read music notated in tablature (often abbreviated as \"tab\"), which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard. Tablature was used in the Baroque era to notate music for the lute, a stringed, fretted instrument.\nOral and aural tradition.\nMany types of music, such as traditional blues and folk music were not written down in sheet music; instead, they were originally preserved in the memory of performers, and the songs were handed down orally, from one musician or singer to another, or aurally, in which a performer learns a song \"by ear\". When the composer of a song or piece is no longer known, this music is often classified as \"traditional\" or as a \"folk song\". Different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material, from quite strict, to those that demand improvisation or modification to the music. A culture's history and stories may also be passed on by ear through song.\nElements.\nMusic has many different fundamentals or elements. Depending on the definition of \"element\" being used, these can include pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form, and structure. The elements of music feature prominently in the music curriculums of Australia, the UK, and the US. All three curriculums identify pitch, dynamics, timbre, and texture as elements, but the other identified elements of music are far from universally agreed upon. Below is a list of the three official versions of the \"elements of music\":\nIn relation to the UK curriculum, in 2013 the term: \"appropriate musical notations\" was added to their list of elements and the title of the list was changed from the \"elements of music\" to the \"inter-related dimensions of music\". The inter-related dimensions of music are listed as: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure, and appropriate musical notations.\nThe phrase \"the elements of music\" is used in a number of different contexts. The two most common contexts can be differentiated by describing them as the \"rudimentary elements of music\" and the \"perceptual elements of music\".\nPitch.\nPitch is an aspect of a sound that we can hear, reflecting whether one musical sound, note, or tone is \"higher\" or \"lower\" than another musical sound, note, or tone. We can talk about the highness or lowness of pitch in the more general sense, such as the way a listener hears a piercingly high piccolo note or whistling tone as higher in pitch than a deep thump of a bass drum. We also talk about pitch in the precise sense associated with musical melodies, basslines and chords. Precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. For example, it is much easier for listeners to discern the pitch of a single note played on a piano than to try to discern the pitch of a crash cymbal that is struck.\nMelody.\nA melody, also called a \"tune\", is a series of pitches (notes) sounding in succession (one after the other), often in a rising and falling pattern. The notes of a melody are typically created using pitch systems such as scales or modes. Melodies also often contain notes from the chords used in the song. The melodies in simple folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes of a single scale, the scale associated with the tonic note or key of a given song. For example, a folk song in the key of C (also referred to as C major) may have a melody that uses only the notes of the C major scale (the individual notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B, and C; these are the \"white notes\" on a piano keyboard. On the other hand, Bebop-era jazz from the 1940s and contemporary music from the 20th and 21st centuries may use melodies with many chromatic notes (i.e., notes in addition to the notes of the major scale; on a piano, a chromatic scale would include all the notes on the keyboard, including the \"white notes\" and \"black notes\" and unusual scales, such as the whole tone scale (a whole tone scale in the key of C would contain the notes C, D, E, F\u266f, G\u266f and A\u266f). A low musical line played by bass instruments, such as double bass, electric bass, or tuba, is called a bassline.\nHarmony.\nHarmony refers to the \"vertical\" sounds of pitches in music, which means pitches that are played or sung together at the same time creates a chord. Usually, this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure (i.e., by using melody notes that are played one after the other, outlining the notes of a chord). In music written using the system of major-minor tonality (\"keys\"), which includes most classical music written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock, and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the \"home note\" or tonic to which the piece generally resolves, and the character (e.g. major or minor) of the scale in use. Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music songs are written so that all the music is in a single key. More complex Classical, pop, and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys (and in some cases three or more keys). Classical music from the Romantic era (written from about 1820\u20131900) often contains multiple keys, as does jazz, especially Bebop jazz from the 1940s, in which the key or \"home note\" of a song may change every four bars or even every two bars.\nRhythm.\nRhythm is the arrangement of sounds and silences in time. Meter animates time in regular pulse groupings, called measures or bars, which in Western classical, popular, and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as Waltz time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 time). Meters are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place an emphasis on the first beat of each grouping. Notable exceptions exist, such as the backbeat used in much Western pop and rock, in which a song that uses a measure that consists of four beats (called 4/4 time or common time) will have accents on beats two and four, which are typically performed by the drummer on the snare drum, a loud and distinctive-sounding percussion instrument. In pop and rock, the rhythm parts of a song are played by the rhythm section, which includes chord-playing instruments (e.g., electric guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, or other keyboard instruments), a bass instrument (typically electric bass or for some styles such as jazz and bluegrass, double bass) and a drum kit player.\nTexture.\nMusical texture is the overall sound of a piece of music or song. The texture of a piece or song is determined by how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall nature of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see common types below). For example, a thick texture contains many 'layers' of instruments. One layer can be a string section or another brass. The thickness is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments. Texture is commonly described according to the number of and relationship between parts or lines of music:\nMusic that contains a large number of independent parts (e.g., a double concerto accompanied by 100 orchestral instruments with many interweaving melodic lines) is generally said to have a \"thicker\" or \"denser\" texture than a work with few parts (e.g., a solo flute melody accompanied by a single cello).\nTimbre.\nTimbre, sometimes called \"color\" or \"tone color\" is the quality or sound of a voice or instrument. Timbre is what makes a particular musical sound different from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. For example, a 440\u00a0Hz A note sounds different when it is played on oboe, piano, violin, or electric guitar. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique (e.g., different embouchures), different types of accessories (e.g., mouthpieces for brass players, reeds for oboe and bassoon players) or strings made out of different materials for string players (e.g., gut strings versus steel strings). Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument (one after the other) may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument (e.g., two string players might hold the bow differently).\nThe physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include the spectrum, envelope, and overtones of a note or musical sound. For electric instruments developed in the 20th century, such as electric guitar, electric bass and electric piano, the performer can also change the tone by adjusting equalizer controls, tone controls on the instrument, and by using electronic effects units such as distortion pedals. The tone of the electric Hammond organ is controlled by adjusting drawbars.\nExpression.\nExpressive qualities are those elements in music that create change in music without changing the main pitches or substantially changing the rhythms of the melody and its accompaniment. Performers, including singers and instrumentalists, can add musical expression to a song or piece by adding phrasing, by adding effects such as vibrato (with voice and some instruments, such as guitar, violin, brass instruments, and woodwinds), dynamics (the loudness or softness of piece or a section of it), tempo fluctuations (e.g., ritardando or accelerando, which are, respectively slowing down and speeding up the tempo), by adding pauses or fermatas on a cadence, and by changing the articulation of the notes (e.g., making notes more pronounced or accented, by making notes more legato, which means smoothly connected, or by making notes shorter).\nExpression is achieved through the manipulation of pitch (such as inflection, vibrato, slides etc.), volume (dynamics, accent, tremolo etc.), duration (tempo fluctuations, rhythmic changes, changing note duration such as with legato and staccato, etc.), timbre (e.g. changing vocal timbre from a light to a resonant voice) and sometimes even texture (e.g. doubling the bass note for a richer effect in a piano piece). Expression therefore can be seen as a manipulation of all elements to convey \"an indication of mood, spirit, character etc.\" and as such cannot be included as a unique perceptual element of music, although it can be considered an important rudimentary element of music.\nForm.\nIn music, form describes the overall structure or plan of a song or piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections. In the early 20th century, Tin Pan Alley songs and Broadway musical songs were often in AABA thirty-two-bar form, in which the A sections repeated the same eight bar melody (with variation) and the B section provided a contrasting melody or harmony for eight bars. From the 1960s onward, Western pop and rock songs are often in verse-chorus form, which comprises a sequence of verse and chorus (\"refrain\") sections, with new lyrics for most verses and repeating lyrics for the choruses. Popular music often makes use of strophic form, sometimes in conjunction with the twelve bar blues.\nIn the tenth edition of \"The Oxford Companion to Music\", Percy Scholes defines musical form as \"a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration.\" Examples of common forms of Western music include the fugue, the invention, sonata-allegro, canon, strophic, theme and variations, and rondo.\nScholes states that European classical music had only six stand-alone forms: simple binary, simple ternary, compound binary, rondo, air with variations, and fugue (although musicologist Alfred Mann emphasized that the fugue is primarily a method of composition that has sometimes taken on certain structural conventions.)\nWhere a piece cannot readily be broken into sectional units (though it might borrow some form from a poem, story or programme), it is said to be through-composed. Such is often the case with a fantasia, prelude, rhapsody, etude (or study), symphonic poem, Bagatelle, impromptu or similar composition. Professor Charles Keil classified forms and formal detail as \"sectional, developmental, or variational.\"\nPhilosophy.\nThe philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions regarding music and has connections with questions in metaphysics and aesthetics. Questions include:\nIn ancient times, such as with the Ancient Greeks, the aesthetics of music explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the 18th century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (\"plaisir\" and \"jouissance\") of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten in the 18th century, followed by Immanuel Kant. Through their writing, the ancient term 'aesthetics', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In the 2000s, philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been foregrounded.\nIn the 20th century, important contributions were made by Peter Kivy, Jerrold Levinson, Roger Scruton, and Stephen Davies. However, many musicians, music critics, and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between Eduard Hanslick, a music critic and musicologist, and composer Richard Wagner regarding whether music can express meaning. Harry Partch and some other musicologists, such as Kyle Gann, have studied and tried to popularize microtonal music and the usage of alternate musical scales. Modern composers like La Monte Young, Rhys Chatham and Glenn Branca paid much attention to a scale called just intonation.\nIt is often thought that music has the ability to affect our emotions, intellect, and psychology; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. Plato suggests in \"The Republic\" that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII). In Ancient China, Confucius believed that music and rituals or rites are interconnected and harmonious with nature; he stated that music was the harmonization of heaven and earth, while the order was brought by the rites order, making them extremely crucial functions in society.\nPsychology.\nModern music psychology aims to explain and understand musical behavior and experience. Research in this field and its subfields are primarily empirical; their knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic observation of and interaction with human participants. In addition to its focus on fundamental perceptions and cognitive processes, music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music performance, composition, education, criticism, and therapy, as well as investigations of human aptitude, skill, intelligence, creativity, and social behavior.\nNeuroscience.\nCognitive neuroscience of music is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. The field is distinguished by its reliance on direct observations of the brain, using such techniques as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), and positron emission tomography (PET).\nCognitive musicology.\nCognitive musicology is a branch of cognitive science concerned with computationally modeling musical knowledge with the goal of understanding both music and cognition. The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories and has roots in artificial intelligence and cognitive science.\nCognitive musicology investigates topics such as the parallels between language and music in the brain. Research often includes biologically inspired models of computation, such as neural networks and evolutionary programs. This field seeks to model how musical knowledge is represented, stored, perceived, performed, and generated. By using a well-structured computer environment, the systematic structures of these cognitive phenomena can be investigated.\nPsychoacoustics.\nPsychoacoustics is the scientific study of sound perception. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying the psychological and physiological responses associated with sound (including speech and music). It can be further categorized as a branch of psychophysics.\nEvolutionary musicology.\nEvolutionary musicology concerns the \"origins of music, the question of animal song, selection pressures underlying music evolution\", and \"music evolution and human evolution\". It seeks to understand music perception and activity in the context of evolutionary theory. Charles Darwin speculated that music may have held an adaptive advantage and functioned as a protolanguage, a view which has spawned several competing theories of music evolution. An alternate view sees music as a by-product of linguistic evolution; a type of \"auditory cheesecake\" that pleases the senses without providing any adaptive function. This view has been directly countered by numerous music researchers.\nCultural effects.\nAn individual's culture or ethnicity plays a role in their music cognition, including their preferences, emotional reaction, and musical memory. Musical preferences are biased toward culturally familiar musical traditions beginning in infancy, and adults' classification of the emotion of a musical piece depends on both culturally specific and universal structural features. Additionally, individuals' musical memory abilities are greater for culturally familiar music than for culturally unfamiliar music.\nPerceptual.\nSince the emergence of the study of psychoacoustics in the 1930s, most lists of elements of music have related more to how we \"hear\" music than how we learn to play it or study it. C.E. Seashore, in his book \"Psychology of Music\", identified four \"psychological attributes of sound\". These were: \"pitch, loudness, time, and timbre\" (p.\u00a03). He did not call them the \"elements of music\" but referred to them as \"elemental components\" (p.\u00a02). Nonetheless, these elemental components link precisely with four of the most common musical elements: \"Pitch\" and \"timbre\" match exactly, \"loudness\" links with dynamics, and \"time\" links with the time-based elements of rhythm, duration, and tempo. This usage of the phrase \"the elements of music\" links more closely with \"Webster's New 20th Century Dictionary\" definition of an element as: \"a substance which cannot be divided into a simpler form by known methods\" and educational institutions' lists of elements generally align with this definition as well.\nAlthough writers of lists of \"rudimentary elements of music\" can vary their lists depending on their personal (or institutional) priorities, the perceptual elements of music should consist of an established (or proven) list of discrete elements which can be independently manipulated to achieve an intended musical effect. It seems at this stage that there is still research to be done in this area.\nA slightly different way of approaching the identification of the elements of music, is to identify the \"elements of sound\" as: pitch, duration, loudness, timbre, sonic texture and spatial location, and then to define the \"elements of music\" as: sound, structure, and artistic intent.\nSociological aspects.\nEthnographic studies demonstrate that music is a participatory, community-based activity. Music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings from being alone, to attending a large concert, forming a music community, which cannot be understood as a function of individual will or accident; it includes both commercial and non-commercial participants with a shared set of common values. Musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus.\nIn Europe and North America, there was a divide between what types of music were viewed as \"high culture\" and \"low culture.\" \"High culture\" included Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and modern-era symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly. Other types of music\u2014including jazz, blues, soul, and country\u2014are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may drink, dance and cheer. Until the 20th century, the division between \"high\" and \"low\" musical forms was accepted as a valid distinction that separated out \"art music\", from popular music heard in bars and dance halls. Musicologists, such as David Brackett, note a \"redrawing of high-low cultural-aesthetic boundaries\" in the 20th century. And, \"when industry and public discourses link categories of music with categories of people, they tend to conflate stereotypes with actual listening communities.\" Stereotypes can be based on socioeconomic standing, or social class, of the performers or audience of the different types of music.\nWhen composers introduce styles of music that break with convention, there can be strong resistance from academics and others. Late-period Beethoven string quartets, Stravinsky ballet scores, serialism, bebop, hip hop, punk rock, and electronica were controversial and criticised, when they were first introduced. Such themes are examined in the sociology of music, sometimes called sociomusicology, which is pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to ethnomusicology.\nRole of women.\nWomen have played a major role in music throughout history, as composers, songwriters, instrumental performers, singers, conductors, music scholars, music educators, music critics/music journalists and other musical professions. In the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of popular music and classical music singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women record producers, rock critics and rock instrumentalists. Although there have been a huge number of women composers in classical music, from the medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the commonly performed classical music repertoire, music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the \"Concise Oxford History of Music\", Clara Schumann is one of the few female composers who is mentioned.\nWomen comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked Vienna Philharmonic orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and heavy metal, although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and all-female bands. Women are particularly underrepresented in extreme metal genres. In the 1960s pop-music scene, \"[l]ike most aspects of the...music business, [in the 1960s,] songwriting was a male-dominated field. Though there were plenty of female singers on the radio, women ...were primarily seen as consumers:... Singing was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument, writing songs, or producing records simply wasn't done.\" Young women \"...were not socialized to see themselves as people who create [music].\"\nWomen are also underrepresented in orchestral conducting, music criticism/music journalism, music producing, and sound engineering. While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, and there are few women musicologists, women became involved in music education \"...to such a degree that women dominated [this field] during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century.\"\nAccording to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's \"The Independent\", women musicians in classical music are \"...too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent\" and they face pressure \"...to look sexy onstage and in photos.\" Duchen states that while \"[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful.\" According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the conductor of an orchestra. In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the audio console acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process. One of the most recorded artists is Asha Bhosle, an Indian singer best known as a playback singer in Hindi cinema.\nMedia and technology.\nSince the 20th century, live music can be broadcast over the radio, television or the Internet, or recorded and listened to on a CD player or MP3 player.\nIn the early 20th century (in the late 1920s), as talking pictures emerged in the early 20th century, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work. During the 1920s, live musical performances by orchestras, pianists, and theater organists were common at first-run theaters. With the coming of the talking motion pictures, those featured performances were largely eliminated. The American Federation of Musicians (AFM) took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the \"Pittsburgh Press\" features an image of a can labeled \"Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever\"\nSometimes, live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds. For example, a disc jockey uses disc records for scratching, and some 20th-century works have a solo for an instrument or voice that is performed along with music that is prerecorded onto a tape. Some pop bands use recorded backing tracks. Computers and many keyboards can be programmed to produce and play Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) music. Audiences can also \"become\" performers by participating in karaoke, an activity of Japanese origin centered on a device that plays voice-eliminated versions of well-known songs. Most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics to songs being performed; performers can follow the lyrics as they sing over the instrumental tracks.\nThe advent of the Internet and widespread high-speed broadband access has transformed the experience of music, partly through the increased ease of access to recordings of music via streaming video and vastly increased choice of music for consumers. Another effect of the Internet arose with online communities and social media websites like YouTube and Facebook, a social networking service. These sites make it easier for aspiring singers and amateur bands to distribute videos of their songs, connect with other musicians, and gain audience interest. Professional musicians also use YouTube as a free publisher of promotional material. YouTube users, for example, no longer only download and listen to MP3s, but also actively create their own. According to Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams, in their book \"Wikinomics\", there has been a shift from a traditional consumer role to what they call a \"prosumer\" role, a consumer who both creates content and consumes. Manifestations of this in music include the production of mashes, remixes, and music videos by fans.\nMusic streaming services have further transformed music production. Streaming platforms, such as Spotify and Apple Music, mediate how music is consumed and distributed. This raises questions about how artists market their releases (i.e. as 'limited edition'), algorithmic suggestions, and affordable access to recorded music.\nGenerative AI systems, more commonly known as Music Metacreation in music generation, are increasingly being used to create music. A more neutral term is 'Music Generation Systems' (MGSs).\nEducation.\nNon-institutional.\nThe incorporation of music into general education from preschool to post secondary education is common in North America and Europe. Involvement in playing and singing music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentration, counting, listening, and cooperation while also promoting understanding of language, improving the ability to recall information, and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other areas. In elementary schools, children often learn to play instruments such as the recorder, sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of Western art music and traditional music. Some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles. In religious schools, children sing hymns and other religious music. In secondary schools (but rarely in primary schools), students may have the opportunity to perform in some types of musical ensembles, such as choirs (a group of singers), marching bands, concert bands, jazz bands, or orchestras. In some school systems, music lessons on how to play instruments may be provided. Some students also take private music lessons after school with a singing teacher or instrument teacher. Amateur musicians typically learn basic musical rudiments (e.g., learning about musical notation for musical scales and rhythms) and beginner- to intermediate-level singing or instrument-playing techniques.\nAt the university level, students in most arts and humanities programs can receive credit for taking a few music courses, which typically take the form of an overview course on the history of music, or a music appreciation course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities have some types of musical ensembles that students in arts and humanities are able to participate in, such as choirs, marching bands, concert bands, or orchestras. The study of Western art music is increasingly common outside of North America and Europe, such as the Indonesian Institute of the Arts in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, or the classical music programs that are available in Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-Western cultures, such as the music of Africa or Bali (e.g. Gamelan music).\nInstitutional.\nPeople aiming to become professional musicians, singers, composers, songwriters, music teachers and practitioners of other music-related professions such as music history professors, sound engineers, and so on study in specialized post-secondary programs offered by colleges, universities and music conservatories. Some institutions that train individuals for careers in music offer training in a wide range of professions, as is the case with many of the top U.S. universities, which offer degrees in music performance (including singing and playing instruments), music history, music theory, music composition, music education (for individuals aiming to become elementary or high school music teachers) and, in some cases, conducting. On the other hand, some small colleges may only offer training in a single profession (e.g., sound recording).\nWhile most university and conservatory music programs focus on training students in classical music, there are universities and colleges that train musicians for careers as jazz or popular music musicians and composers, with notable U.S. examples including the Manhattan School of Music and the Berklee College of Music. Two schools in Canada which offer professional jazz training are McGill University and Humber College. Individuals aiming at careers in some types of music, such as heavy metal music, country music or blues are unlikely to become professionals by completing degrees or diplomas. Instead, they typically learn about their style of music by singing or playing in bands (often beginning in amateur bands, cover bands and tribute bands), studying recordings on DVD and the Internet, and working with already-established professionals in their style of music, either through informal mentoring or regular music lessons. Since the 2000s, the increasing popularity and availability of Internet forums and YouTube \"how-to\" videos have enabled singers and musicians from metal, blues and similar genres to improve their skills. Many pop, rock and country singers train informally with vocal coaches and voice teachers.\nAcademic study.\nMusicology.\nMusicology, the academic study of music, is studied in universities and music conservatories. The earliest definitions from the 19th century defined three sub-disciplines of musicology: systematic musicology, historical musicology, and comparative musicology or ethnomusicology. In 2010-era scholarship, one is more likely to encounter a division into music theory, music history, and ethnomusicology. Research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of psychoacoustics. The study of music of non-Western cultures, and cultural study of music, is called ethnomusicology. Students can pursue study of musicology, ethnomusicology, music history, and music theory through different types of degrees, including bachelor's, master's and PhD.\nMusic theory.\nMusic theory is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines. More broadly it refers to any study of music, usually related in some form with compositional concerns, and may include mathematics, physics, and anthropology. What is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the common practice period, or tonal music. Theory, even of music of the common practice period, may take other forms. Musical set theory is the application of mathematical set theory to music, first applied to atonal music. \"Speculative music theory\", contrasted with \"analytic music theory\", is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials, for example tuning systems, generally as preparation for composition.\nZoomusicology.\nZoomusicology is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As George Herzog (1941) asked, \"do animals have music?\" Fran\u00e7ois-Bernard M\u00e2che's \"Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion\" (1983), a study of \"ornitho-musicology\" using a technique of Nicolas Ruwet's \"Language, musique, po\u00e9sie\" (1972) paradigmatic segmentation analysis, shows that bird songs are organised according to a repetition-transformation principle. Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990), argues that \"in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organised and conceptualised (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human.\"\nEthnomusicology.\nIn the West, much of the history of music that is taught deals with the Western civilization's art music, known as classical music. The history of music in non-Western cultures (\"world music\" or the field of \"ethnomusicology\") is also taught in Western universities. This includes the documented classical traditions of Asian countries outside the influence of Western Europe, as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures. Popular or folk styles of music in non-Western countries varied from culture to culture, and period to period. Different cultures emphasised different instruments, techniques, singing styles and uses for music. Music has been used for entertainment, ceremonies, rituals, religious purposes and for practical and artistic communication. Non-Western music has also been used for propaganda purposes, as was the case with Chinese opera during the Cultural Revolution.\nThere is a host of music classifications for non-Western music, many of which are caught up in the argument over the definition of music. Among the largest of these is the division between classical music (or \"art\" music), and popular music (or commercial music \u2013 including non-Western styles of rock, country, and pop music-related styles). Some genres do not fit neatly into one of these \"big two\" classifications, (such as folk music, world music, or jazz-related music).\nAs world cultures have come into greater global contact, their indigenous musical styles have often merged with other styles, which produces new styles. For example, the United States bluegrass style contains elements from Anglo-Irish, Scottish, Irish, German and African instrumental and vocal traditions, which were able to fuse in the United States' multi-ethnic \"melting pot\" society. Some types of world music contain a mixture of non-Western indigenous styles with Western pop music elements. Genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music. Some works, like George Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\", are claimed by both jazz and classical music, while Gershwin's \"Porgy and Bess\" and Leonard Bernstein's \"West Side Story\" are claimed by both opera and the Broadway musical tradition. Many music festivals for non-Western music, include bands and singers from a particular musical genre, such as world music.\nIndian music, for example, is one of the oldest and longest living types of music, and is still widely heard and performed in South Asia, as well as internationally (especially since the 1960s). Indian music has mainly three forms of classical music, Hindustani, Carnatic, and Dhrupad styles. It has also a large repertoire of styles, which involve only percussion music such as the talavadya performances famous in South India.\nTherapy.\nMusic therapy is an interpersonal process in which a trained therapist uses music and all of its facets\u2014physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual\u2014to help clients to improve or maintain their health. In some instances, the client's needs are addressed directly through music; in others they are addressed through the relationships that develop between the client and therapist. Music therapy is used with individuals of all ages and with a variety of conditions, including: psychiatric disorders, medical problems, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, developmental disabilities, substance abuse issues, communication disorders, interpersonal problems, and aging. It is also used to improve learning, build self-esteem, reduce stress, support physical exercise, and facilitate a host of other health-related activities. Music therapists may encourage clients to sing, play instruments, create songs, or do other musical activities.\nIn the 10th century, the philosopher Al-Farabi described how vocal music can stimulate the feelings and souls of listeners. Music has long been used to help people deal with their emotions. In the 17th century, the scholar Robert Burton's \"The Anatomy of Melancholy\" argued that music and dance were critical in treating mental illness, especially melancholia. He noted that music has an \"excellent power ...to expel many other diseases\" and he called it \"a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy.\" He pointed out that in Antiquity, Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, used music to \"make a melancholy man merry, ...a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout.\" In the Ottoman Empire, mental illnesses were treated with music. In November 2006, Michael J. Crawford and his colleagues also found that music therapy helped schizophrenic patients.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "18845", "revid": "128897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18845", "title": "Mouse", "text": "Small long-tailed rodent\nA mouse (pl.: mice) is a small rodent. Characteristically, mice are known to have a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail, and a high breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (\"Mus musculus\"). Mice are also popular as pets. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter.\nMice are typically distinguished from rats by their size. Generally, when a muroid rodent is discovered, its common name includes the term \"mouse\" if it is smaller, or \"rat\" if it is larger. The common terms \"rat\" and \"mouse\" are not taxonomically specific. Typical mice are classified in the genus \"Mus\", but the term \"mouse\" is not confined to members of \"Mus\" and can also apply to species from other genera such as the deer mouse (\"Peromyscus\").\nDomestic mice sold as pets often differ substantially in size from the common house mouse. This is attributable to breeding and different conditions in the wild. The best-known strain of mouse is the white lab mouse. It has more uniform traits, which makes these mice more useful in research.\nCats, wild dogs, foxes, birds of prey, snakes and certain kinds of arthropods have been known to prey upon mice. Despite this, mice populations remain plentiful. Due to its remarkable adaptability to almost any environment, the mouse is one of the most successful mammalian genera living on Earth today.\nIn certain contexts, mice can be considered vermin. Vermin are a major source of crops damage, as they are known to cause structural damage and spread disease. Mice spread disease through their feces and are often carriers of parasites. In North America, breathing dust that has come in contact with mouse excrement has been linked to hantavirus, which may lead to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS).\nPrimarily nocturnal animals, mice compensate for their poor eyesight with a keen sense of hearing. They depend on their sense of smell to locate food and avoid predators.\nIn the wild, mice are known to build intricate burrows. These burrows have long entrances and are equipped with escape tunnels. In at least one species, the architectural design of a burrow is a genetic trait.\nTypes of animals known as mice.\nThe most common mice are murines, in the same clade as common rats. They are murids, along with gerbils and other close relatives. \nEmotions.\nResearchers at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology have confirmed that mice have a range of facial expressions. They used machine vision to spot familiar human emotions like pleasure, disgust, nausea, pain, and fear.\nDiet.\nIn nature, mice are largely herbivores, consuming any kind of fruit or grain from plants. However, mice adapt well to urban areas and are known for eating almost all types of food scraps. In captivity, mice are commonly fed commercial pelleted mouse diet. These diets are nutritionally complete, but they still need a large variety of vegetables.\nDespite popular belief, most mice do not have a special appetite for cheese. They will only eat cheese for lack of better options.\nHuman use.\nAs experimental animals.\nMice are common experimental animals in laboratory research of biology and psychology fields primarily because they are mammals, and also because they share a high degree of homology with humans. They are the most commonly used mammalian model organism, more common than rats. The mouse genome has been sequenced, and virtually all mouse genes have human homologs. The mouse has approximately 2.7 billion base pairs and 20 pairs of chromosomes.\nThey can also be manipulated in ways that are illegal with humans, although animal rights activists often object. A knockout mouse is a genetically modified mouse that has had one or more of its genes made inoperable through a gene knockout. Experimental mouse model systems include mouse models of colorectal and intestinal cancer, mouse models of Down syndrome and mouse models of breast cancer metastasis.\nReasons for common selection of mice are that they are small and inexpensive, have a widely varied diet, are easily maintained, and can reproduce quickly. Several generations of mice can be observed in a relatively short time. Mice are generally very docile if raised from birth and given sufficient human contact. However, certain strains have been known to be quite temperamental.\nAs pets.\nMany people buy mice as companion pets. They can be playful, loving and can grow used to being handled. Like pet rats, pet mice should not be left unsupervised outside as they have many natural predators, including (but not limited to) birds, snakes, lizards, cats, and dogs. Male mice tend to have a stronger odor than the females. However, mice are careful groomers and as pets they never need bathing. Well looked-after mice can make ideal pets. Some common mouse care products are:\nAs feed.\nMice are a staple in the diet of many small carnivores. In various countries mice are used as feed for pets such as snakes, lizards, frogs, tarantulas, and birds of prey, and many pet stores carry mice for this purpose. Such mice are sold in various sizes and with various amounts of fur. Mice without fur are easier for the animal to consume; however, mice with fur may be more convincing as animal feed.\nAs food.\nHumans have eaten mice since prehistoric times. In Victorian Britain, fried mice were still given to children as a folk remedy for bed-wetting; while Jared Diamond reports creamed mice being used in England as a dietary supplement during Second World War rationing. Mice are a delicacy throughout eastern Zambia and northern Malawi, where they are a seasonal source of protein. Field rat is a popular food in Vietnam and neighboring countries. In many countries, however, mouse is no longer a food item.\nPrescribed cures in Ancient Egypt included mice as medicine. In Ancient Egypt, when infants were ill, mice were eaten as treatment by their mothers. It was believed that mouse eating by the mother would help heal the baby who was ill.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has been written that Multics \"has influenced all modern operating systems since, from microcomputers to mainframes.\"\nInitial planning and development for Multics started in 1964, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Originally it was a cooperative project led by MIT (Project MAC with Fernando Corbat\u00f3) along with General Electric and Bell Labs. It was developed on the GE 645 computer, which was specially designed for it; the first one was delivered to MIT in January 1967. GE offered their earlier GE 635 systems with the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System which they called \"Mark I\" and intended to offer the 645 with Multics as a larger successor. Bell withdrew from the project in 1969 as it became clear it would not deliver a working system in the short term. Shortly thereafter, GE decided to exit the computer industry entirely and sold the division to Honeywell in 1970. Honeywell offered Multics commercially, but with limited success.\nMultics has numerous features intended to ensure high availability so that it would support a computing utility similar to the telephone and electricity utilities. Modular hardware structure and software architecture are used to achieve this. The system can grow in size by simply adding more of the appropriate resource, be it computing power, main memory, or disk storage. Separate access control lists on every file provide flexible information sharing, but complete privacy when needed. Multics has a number of standard mechanisms to allow engineers to analyze the performance of the system, as well as a number of adaptive performance optimization mechanisms.\nDue to its many novel and valuable ideas, Multics has had a significant influence on computer science despite its faults. Its most lasting effect on the computer industry was to inspire the creation of Unix, which carried forward many Multics features, but was able to run on less expensive hardware. Unix was developed at Bell to allow their Multics team to continue their research using smaller machines, first a PDP-7 and ultimately the PDP-11.\nNovel ideas.\nMultics implements a single-level store for data access, discarding the clear distinction between files (called \"segments\" in Multics) and \"process memory\". The memory of a process consists solely of segments that were mapped into its address space. To read or write to them, the process simply uses normal central processing unit (CPU) instructions, and the operating system takes care of making sure that all the modifications were saved to disk. In POSIX terminology, it is as if every file were codice_1ed; however, in Multics there is no concept of \"process memory\", separate from the memory used to hold mapped-in files, as Unix has. \"All\" memory in the system is part of \"some\" segment, which appears in the file system; this includes the temporary scratch memory of the process, its kernel stack, etc.\nSegments are limited to 256 kilowords, just over 1\u00a0MB, because Multics hardware had 18-bit word addresses for the content of a segment. Larger files are \"multisegment files\" and are handled differently. The 256\u00a0kiloword limit was rarely encountered in practice, because at the time, one megabyte of memory was prohibitively expensive.\nAnother major new idea of Multics was dynamic linking, in which a running process can make external routines available by adding the segments containing them to its address space. This allows applications to always use the latest version of any external routine, since those routines are kept in other segments, which are dynamically linked only when a process first attempts to begin execution in them. Since different processes can use different search rules, different users can end up using different versions of external routines. Equally importantly, with the appropriate settings in the Multics security facilities, the code in the other segment can gain access to data structures maintained in a different process. Dynamic linking in Multics does not require special dynamic-link libraries (DLLs); a program can dynamically link to any executable segment to which it has access rights.\nThus, to interact with an application running in part as a daemon (in another process), a user's process simply performs a normal procedure-call instruction to a code segment to which it had dynamically linked (a code segment that implemented some operation associated with the daemon). The code in that segment can then modify data maintained and used in the daemon. When the action necessary to commence the request is completed, a simple procedure return instruction returns control of the user's process to the user's code.\nMultics also supports extremely aggressive on-line reconfiguration: central processing units, memory banks, disk drives, etc. can be added and removed while the system continues operating. At the MIT system, where most early software development was done, it was common practice to split the multiprocessor system into two separate systems during off-hours by incrementally removing enough components to form a second working system, leaving the rest still running for the original logged-in users. System software development testing could be done on the second system, then the components of the second system were added back to the main user system, without ever having shut it down. Multics is one of the earliest multiprocessor systems.\nMultics is the first major operating system to be designed as a secure system from the outset. Despite this, early versions of Multics were compromised repeatedly. This led to further work that made the system more secure, and prefigured modern security engineering techniques. Break-ins became very rare once the second-generation hardware base was adopted; it has hardware support for ring-oriented security, a multilevel refinement of the concept of master mode. A US Air Force tiger team project tested Multics security in 1973 under the codeword ZARF. On 28 May 1997, the American National Security Agency declassified this use of the codeword ZARF.\nMultics is the first operating system to provide a hierarchical file system, and file names can be of almost arbitrary length and syntax. A given file or directory can have multiple names (typically a long and short form), and symbolic links between directories are also supported. Multics is the first to use the now-standard concept of per-process stacks in the kernel, with a separate stack for each security ring. It is also the first to have a command processor implemented as ordinary user code \u2013 an idea later used in the Unix shell. It is also one of the first written in a high-level language (Multics PL/I), after the Burroughs MCP system written in ESPOL, an expanded version of ALGOL.\nThe deployment of Multics into secure computing environments also spurred the development of innovative supporting applications. In 1975, Morrie Gasser of MITRE Corporation developed a pronounceable random word generator to address password requirements of installations such as the Air Force Data Services Center (AFDSC) processing classified information. To avoid guessable passwords, the AFDSC decided to assign passwords but concluded the manual assignment required too much administrative overhead. Thus, a random word generator was researched and then developed in PL/I. Instead of being based on phonemes or individual letters or clarities, the system employed phonemic segments (second order approximations of English) and other rules to enhance pronounceability and randomness, which was statistically modeled against other approaches. A descendant of this generator was added to Multics during Project Guardian.\nProject history.\nIn 1964, Multics was developed initially for the GE-645 mainframe, a 36-bit system. GE's computer business, including Multics, was taken over by Honeywell in 1970; around 1973, Multics was supported on the Honeywell 6180 machines, which included security improvements including hardware support for protection rings.\nBell Labs pulled out of the project in 1969; some of the people who had worked on it there went on to create the Unix system. Multics development continued at MIT and General Electric. At MIT in 1975, use of Multics was declining and did not recover by 1976 to prior levels. Finally by slashing prices, MIT managed to lure users back to Multics in 1978.\nIn 1974 Honeywell entered into a development contract with the Air Force (with MIT as a sub-contractor) to develop a security kernel for Multics. This would involve reducing the size of the Multics hardcore by moving specific components of the supervisor out of Ring 0. One of the initial steps after carrying out a security evaluation was the implementation of a multilevel security framework within Multics called AIM (Access Isolation Mechanism). This provided mandatory access control which could be enabled to supplement the already existing discretionary access control that Multics already possessed. The resulting Project Guardian ran until termination in 1976; whilst most of its changes were not added to Multics, some parts of the project such as the proposed Secure Front End Processor was productized by Honeywell as SCOMP (Secure Communications Processor). The SCOMP and its STOP operating system eventually evolved via XTS-200 and XTS-300 into current XTS-400 offering of secure operating systems.\nHoneywell continued system development until 1985. About 80 multimillion-dollar sites were installed, at universities, industry, and government sites. The French university system had several installations in the early 1980s. After Honeywell stopped supporting Multics, users migrated to other systems, such as Unix.\nIn 1985, Multics was issued certification as a B2 level secure operating system using the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria from the National Computer Security Center (NCSC), a division of the NSA; it was the first operating system evaluated to this level.\nMultics was distributed from 1975 to 2000 by Groupe Bull in Europe, and by Bull HN Information Systems Inc. in the United States. In 2006, Bull SAS released the source code of Multics versions MR10.2, MR11.0, MR12.0, MR12.1, MR12.2, MR12.3, MR12.4 &amp; MR12.5 under a free software license.\nThe last known Multics installation running natively on Honeywell hardware was shut down on October 30, 2000, at the Canadian Department of National Defence in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.\nCurrent status.\nIn 2006 Bull HN released the source code for MR12.5, the final 1992 Multics release, to MIT. Most of the system is now available as free software with the exception of some optional pieces such as TCP/IP.\nIn 2014, Multics was successfully run on current hardware using an emulator created by Multicians Harry Reed and Charles Anthony. The 1.0 release of the emulator is available as of 2017[ [update]]. Release 12.6f of Multics accompanies the 1.0 release of the emulator, and adds a few new features, including command line recall and editing using the video system.\nCommands.\nThe following is a list of programs and commands for common computing tasks that are supported by the Multics command-line interface.\nCompilers, assemblers, and interpreters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEmail.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOn-line documentation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nActive functions.\nThe Multics shell language supports \"active functions\", which are similar to commands, but which return a string value. An active function is called by putting the active function name and the arguments to the active function in square brackets [ and ]. The string returned by the active function is substituted into the command in place of the call to the active function. For example, when the command echo [working_dir] is processed, the active function working_dir is run; it returns the full path of the working directory, which is substituted into the command, so that the echo command prints the working directory.\nSome programs can act either as commands or as active functions; when run as a command, its result is printed, and when run as an active function, its result is returned as a string.\nSome common active functions are:\nRetrospective observations.\nPeter H. Salus, author of a book covering Unix's early years, stated one position: \"With Multics they tried to have a much more versatile and flexible operating system, and it failed miserably\". This position, however, is said to have been discredited in the computing community because many of Multics' technical innovations are used in modern commercial computing systems.\nThe permanently resident kernel of Multics, a system derided in its day as being too large and complex, was 135\u00a0KB of code. The first MIT GE-645 had 512 kilowords of memory (2\u00a0MiB), a truly enormous amount at the time, and the kernel used a moderate portion of Multics main memory.\nThe entire system, including the operating system and the complex PL/I compiler, user commands, and subroutine libraries, consists of about 1500 source modules. These average roughly 200 lines of source code each, and compile to a total of roughly 4.5\u00a0MiB of procedure code, which was fairly large by the standards of the day.\nMultics compilers generally optimise more for code density than CPU performance, for example using small sub-routines called \"operators\" for short standard code sequences, which makes comparison of object code size with modern systems less useful. High code density is a good optimisation choice for Multics as a multi-user system with expensive main memory.\nDuring its commercial product history, it was often commented internally that the Honeywell Information Systems (HIS) (later Honeywell-Bull) sales and marketing staff were more familiar with and comfortable making the business case for Honeywell's other computer line, the DPS 6 running GCOS. The DPS-6 and GCOS was a well-regarded and reliable platform for inventory, accounting, word processing, and vertical market applications, such as banking, where it had a sizeable customer base. In contrast, the full potential of Multics\u2019 flexibility for even mundane tasks was not easy to comprehend in that era and its features were generally outside the skill set of contemporary business analysts. The scope of this disconnect was concretized by an anecdote conveyed by Paul Stachour, CNO/CSC:\nWhen American Telephone and Telegraph was changing its name to just AT&amp;T in 1983, a staffer from Honeywell\u2019s legal department showed up and asked a Multician if he could arrange to have the name changed in all of their computerized documents. When asked when the process could be completed, the Multician replied, \"It's done.\" The staffer repeated that he needed \"hundreds perhaps thousands\" of documents updated. The Multician explained that he had executed a global search and replace as the staffer was speaking, and the task was in fact completed.\nInfluence on other projects.\nUnix.\nThe design and features of Multics influenced the Unix operating system, which was originally written by two Multics programmers, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. Influence of Multics on Unix is evident in many areas, including the hierarchical file system, redirection, the shell, and the naming of some commands. But the internal design philosophy is quite different, focusing on keeping the system small and simple, and so correcting some perceived deficiencies of Multics because of its high resource demands on the limited computer hardware of the time.\nThe name \"Unix\" (originally \"Unics\") is itself a pun on \"Multics\". The \"U\" in Unix is rumored to stand for \"uniplexed\" as opposed to the \"multiplexed\" of Multics, further underscoring the designers' rejections of Multics' complexity in favor of a more straightforward and workable approach for smaller computers. (Garfinkel and Abelson cite an alternative origin: Peter Neumann at Bell Labs, watching a demonstration of the prototype, suggested the pun name UNICS \u2013 pronounced \"eunuchs\" \u2013 as a \"castrated Multics\", although Dennis Ritchie is said to have denied this.)\nKen Thompson, in a transcribed 2007 interview with Peter Seibel refers to Multics as \"overdesigned and overbuilt and over everything. It was close to unusable. They [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] still claim it's a monstrous success, but it just clearly wasn't\". On the influence of Multics on Unix, Thompson stated that \"the things that I liked enough (about Multics) to actually take were the hierarchical file system and the shell \u2014 a separate process that you can replace with some other process\".\nDennis Ritchie wrote that the design of UNIX was influenced by CTSS.\nOther operating systems.\nThe Prime Computer operating system, PRIMOS, was referred to as \"Multics in a shoebox\" by William Poduska, a founder of the company. Poduska later moved on to found Apollo Computer, whose AEGIS and later Domain/OS operating systems, sometimes called \"Multics in a matchbox\", extends the Multics design to a networked graphics workstation environment.\nThe Stratus VOS operating system of Stratus Computer (now Stratus Technologies) is very strongly influenced by Multics, and both its external user interface and internal structure bear many close resemblances to the older project. The high-reliability, availability, and security features of Multics are extended in Stratus VOS to support a new line of fault tolerant computer systems supporting secure, reliable transaction processing. Stratus VOS is the most directly related descendant of Multics still in active development and production usage today.\nGeneral Motors' Multiple Console Time Sharing System (MCTS) for the Control Data Corporation STAR-100 computer was based on Multics.\nThe protection architecture of Multics, restricting the ability of code at one level of the system to access resources at another, was adopted as the basis for the security features of ICL's VME operating system.\nThe Edinburgh Multiple Access System (EMAS) draws particularly on the one-level store concept used by Multics, providing access to files only by mapping them into memory. All memory space is associated with a segment.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nThe literature contains a large number of papers about Multics, and various components of it; a fairly complete list is available at the http:// page and on a second, briefer http:// (text format).

An individual studying a Marxist representation in a film, might take special interest in its representations of political hierarchy and social injustices.\nOverview.\nSergei Eisenstein and many other Soviet filmmakers in the 1920s expressed ideas of Marxism through film. The Hegelian dialectic was considered best displayed in film editing through the Kuleshov Experiment and the development of montage. While this structuralist approach to Marxism and filmmaking was used, the more outspoken complaint that the Russian filmmakers had, was with the narrative structure of the United States cinema.\nEisenstein's solution was to shun narrative structure by eliminating the individual protagonist and tell stories where the action is moved by the group and the story is told through a clash of one image against the next (whether in composition, motion, or idea) so that the audience is never lulled into believing that they are watching something that has not been worked over. Eisenstein himself was accused by the Soviet authorities under Joseph Stalin of \"formalist error\", of highlighting form as a thing of beauty instead of portraying the worker nobly.\nFrench Marxist film makers, such as Jean-Luc Godard, employed radical editing and choice of subject matter as well as subversive parody to heighten class consciousness and promote Marxist ideas. Situationist film maker Guy Debord, author of \"The Society of the Spectacle\", began his film \"In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni\" with a radical critique of the spectator who goes to the cinema to forget about their dispossessed daily life. Situationist film makers produced a number of important films, where the only contribution by the situationist film cooperative was the sound-track. In \"Can dialectics break bricks?\" (1973), a Chinese Kung Fu film was transformed by redubbing into an epistle on state capitalism and Proletarian revolution. The intellectual technique of using capitalism's own structures against itself is known as d\u00e9tournement.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many words are themselves standalone morphemes, while other words contain multiple morphemes; in linguistic terminology, this is the distinction, respectively, between free and bound morphemes. The field of linguistic study dedicated to morphemes is called morphology.\nIn English, inside a word with multiple morphemes, the main morpheme that gives the word its basic meaning is called a root (such as \"cat\" inside the word \"cats\"), which can be bound or free. Meanwhile, additional bound morphemes, called affixes, may be added before or after the root, like the \"-s\" in \"cats\", which indicates plurality but is always bound to a root noun and is not regarded as a word on its own. However, in some languages, including English and Latin, even many roots cannot stand alone; i.e., they are bound morphemes. For instance, the Latin root \"reg-\" ('king') must always be suffixed with a case marker: \"regis\", \"regi\", \"rex\" (\"reg+s\"), etc. The same is true of the English root \"nat(e)\" \u2014 ultimately inherited from a Latin root meaning \"birth, born\" \u2014 which appears in words like \"native\", \"nation\", \"nature\", \"innate\", and \"neonate\". \nThese sample English words have the following morphological analyses:\nClassification.\nFree and bound morphemes.\nEvery morpheme can be classified as free or bound:\nClassification of bound morphemes.\nBound morphemes can be further classified as derivational or inflectional morphemes. The main difference between them is their function in relation to words.\nAllomorphs.\nAllomorphs are variants of a morpheme that differ in form but are semantically similar. For example, the English plural marker has three allomorphs: (\"bugs), (\"bats), or (\"buses\"). An allomorph is a concrete realization of a morpheme, which is an abstract unit. That is parallel to the relation of an allophone and a phoneme.\nZero-morpheme.\nA zero-morpheme is a type of morpheme that carries semantic meaning, but is not represented by auditory phoneme. A word with a zero-morpheme is analyzed as having the morpheme for grammatical purposes, but the morpheme is not realized in speech. They are often represented by /\u2205/ within glosses.\nGenerally, such morphemes have no visible changes. For instance, \"sheep\" is both the singular and the plural form of that noun; rather than taking the usual plural suffix \"-s\" to form hypothetical \"*sheeps\", the plural is analyzed as being composed of \"sheep + -\u2205\", the null plural suffix. The intended meaning is thus derived from the co-occurrence determiner (in this case, \"some-\" or \"a-\").\nIn some cases, a zero-morpheme may also be used to contrast with other inflected forms of a word that contain an audible morpheme. For example, the plural noun \"cats\" in English consists of the root \"cat\" and the plural suffix \"-s,\" and so the singular \"cat\" may be analyzed as the root inflected with the null singular suffix -\"\u2205\".\nContent vs. function.\nContent morphemes express a concrete meaning or \"content\", and function morphemes have more of a grammatical role. For example, the morphemes \"fast\" and \"sad\" can be considered content morphemes. On the other hand, the suffix \"-ed\" is a function morpheme since it has the grammatical function of indicating past tense.\nBoth categories may seem very clear and intuitive, but the idea behind them is occasionally more difficult to grasp since they overlap with each other. Examples of ambiguous situations are the preposition \"over\" and the determiner \"your\", which seem to have concrete meanings but are considered function morphemes since their role is to connect ideas grammatically. Here is a general rule to determine the category of a morpheme:\nOther features.\nRoots are composed of only one morpheme, but stems can be composed of more than one morpheme. Any additional affixes are considered morphemes. For example, in the word \"quirkiness\", the root is \"quirk\", but the stem is \"quirky\", which has two morphemes.\nMoreover, some pairs of affixes have identical phonological form but different meanings. For example, the suffix \"-er\" can be either derivational (e.g. \"sell\" \u21d2 \"seller\") or inflectional (e.g. \"small\" \u21d2 \"smaller\"). Such morphemes are called homophonous.\nSome words might seem to be composed of multiple morphemes but are not. Therefore, not only form but also meaning must be considered when identifying morphemes. For example, the word \"Madagascar\" is long and might seem to have morphemes like \"mad\", \"gas\", and \"car\", but it does not. Conversely, some short words have multiple morphemes (e.g. \"dogs\" = \"dog\" + \"s\").\nMorphological analysis.\nIn natural language processing for Japanese, Chinese, and other languages, morphological analysis is the process of segmenting a sentence into a row of morphemes. Morphological analysis is closely related to part-of-speech tagging, but word segmentation is required for those languages because word boundaries are not indicated by blank spaces.\nThe purpose of morphological analysis is to determine the minimal units of meaning in a language (morphemes) by comparison of similar forms: such as comparing \"She is walking\" and \"They are walking\" with each other, rather than either with something less similar like \"You are reading\". Those forms can be effectively broken down into parts, and the different morphemes can be distinguished.\nBoth meaning and form are equally important for the identification of morphemes. An agent morpheme is an affix like \"-er\" that in English transforms a verb into a noun (e.g. \"teach\" \u2192 \"teacher\"). English also has another morpheme that is identical in pronunciation (and written form) but has an unrelated meaning and function: a comparative morpheme that changes an adjective into another degree of comparison (but remains the same adjective) (e.g. \"small\" \u2192 \"smaller\"). The opposite can also occur: a pair of morphemes with identical meaning but different forms.\nChanging definitions.\nIn generative grammar, the definition of a morpheme depends heavily on whether syntactic trees have morphemes as leaves or features as leaves.\nGiven the definition of a morpheme as \"the smallest meaningful unit\", nanosyntax aims to account for idioms in which an entire syntactic tree often contributes \"the smallest meaningful unit\". An example idiom is \"Don't let the cat out of the bag\". There, the idiom is composed of \"let the cat out of the bag\". That might be considered a semantic morpheme, which is itself composed of many syntactic morphemes. Other cases of the \"smallest meaningful unit\" being longer than a word include some collocations such as \"in view of\" and \"business intelligence\" in which the words, when together, have a specific meaning.\nThe definition of morphemes also plays a significant role in the interfaces of generative grammar in the following theoretical constructs:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos and related music entertainment programming guided by television personalities known as video jockeys (VJs). MTV soon began establishing its presence overseas, eventually gaining an unprecedented cult following and becoming one of the major factors in cable programming's rise to fame, leading American corporations to dominate the television economy in the 1990s.\nIn the years since its inception, the channel significantly toned down its focus on music in favor of original reality programming for teenagers and young adults. As of \u00a02023[ [update]], MTV is available to approximately 67 million pay television households in the United States, down from its 2011 peak of 99 million households.\nHistory.\nMTV was launched on August 1, 1981, at 12:01 a.m., under the ownership of Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment. The first video played on MTV was \u201cVideo Killed the Radio Star\u201d by The Buggles. On June 25, 1984, Warner Communications spun-off Nickelodeon and MTV into a new public corporation called MTV Networks (\"now\" Paramount Media Networks). Warner would later acquire American Express' 50% stake the following year. From August 27, 1985 to May 20, 1986, Warner would sell 31%, and later, 69% of MTV Networks to Viacom.\nProgramming.\nAs MTV expanded, music videos and VJ-guided programming were no longer the centerpiece of its programming (except MTV Germany). The channel's programming has covered a wide variety of genres and formats aimed at adolescents and young adults. In addition to its original programming, MTV has also aired original and syndicated programs from Paramount-owned siblings and third-party networks.\nMTV is also a producer of films aimed at young adults through its production label, MTV Films, and has aired both its own theatrically released films and original made-for-television movies from MTV Studios in addition to acquired films.\nIn 2010, a study by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation found that of 207.5 hours of prime time programming on MTV, 42% included content reflecting the lives of gay, bisexual, and transgender people. This was the highest in the industry and the highest percentage ever.\nIn 2018, MTV launched a new production unit under the MTV Studios name focused on producing new versions of MTV's library shows. It was later consolidated into MTV Entertainment Studios\nVideo Music Awards.\nIn 1984, the channel produced its first MTV Video Music Awards show, or VMAs. The first award show, in 1984, was punctuated by a live performance by Madonna of \"Like a Virgin\". The statuettes that are handed out at the Video Music Awards are of the MTV moon-man, the channel's original image from its first broadcast in 1981. As of 2012[ [update]], the Video Music Awards were MTV's most watched annual event.\nSpecial, annual events.\nMTV began its annual \"Spring Break\" coverage in 1986, setting up temporary operations in Daytona Beach, Florida, for a week in March, broadcasting live eight hours per day. \"Spring break is a youth culture event\", MTV's vice president Doug Herzog said at the time. \"We wanted to be part of it for that reason. It makes good sense for us to come down and go live from the center of it, because obviously the people there are the kinds of people who watch MTV.\"\nThe channel later expanded its beach-themed events to the summer, dedicating most of each summer season to broadcasting live from a beach house at different locations away from New York City, eventually leading to channel-wide branding throughout the summer in the 1990s and early 2000s such as \"Motel California\", \"Summer Share\", \"Isle of MTV\", \"SoCal Summer\", \"Summer in the Keys\", and \"Shore Thing\". MTV VJs would host blocks of music videos, interview artists and bands, and introduce live performances and other programs from the beach house location each summer.\nMTV also held week-long music events that took over the presentation of the channel. Examples from the 1990s and 2000s include \"All Access Week\", a week in the summer dedicated to live concerts and festivals; \"Spankin' New Music Week\", a week in the fall dedicated to brand new music videos; and week-long specials that culminated in a particular live event, such as \"Wanna be a VJ\" and the \"Video Music Awards\".\nAt the end of each year, MTV takes advantage of its home location in New York City to broadcast live coverage on New Year's Eve in Times Square. Several live music performances are featured alongside interviews with artists and bands that were influential throughout the year. For many years from the 1980s to the 2000s, the channel upheld a tradition of having a band perform a cover song at midnight immediately following the beginning of the new year.\nLive concert broadcasts.\nThroughout its history, MTV has covered global benefit concert series live. For most of July 13, 1985, MTV showed the Live Aid concerts, held in London and Philadelphia and organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. While the ABC network showed only selected highlights during prime-time, MTV broadcast 16 hours of coverage.\nAlong with VH1, MTV broadcast the Live 8 concerts, a series of concerts set in the G8 states and South Africa, on July 2, 2005. Live 8 preceded the 31st G8 summit and the 20th anniversary of Live Aid. MTV drew heavy criticism for its coverage of Live 8. The network cut to commercials, VJ commentary, or other performances during performances. Complaints surfaced on the Internet over MTV interrupting the reunion of Pink Floyd. In response, MTV president Van Toffler stated that he wanted to broadcast highlights from every venue of Live 8 on MTV and VH1, and clarified that network hosts talked over performances only in transition to commercials, informative segments or other musical performances. Toffler acknowledged that \"MTV should not have placed such a high priority on showing so many acts, at the expense of airing complete sets by key artists.\" He also blamed the Pink Floyd interruption on a mandatory cable affiliate break. MTV averaged 1.4\u00a0million viewers for its original July 2 broadcast of Live 8. Consequently, MTV and VH1 aired five hours of uninterrupted Live 8 coverage on July 9, with each channel airing other blocks of artists.\nLogo and branding.\nMTV's logo was designed in 1981 by Manhattan Design (a collective formed by Frank Olinsky, Pat Gorman and Patty Rogoff) under the guidance of original creative director Fred Seibert. The block letter \"M\" was sketched by Rogoff, with the scribbled word \"TV\" spraypainted by Olinksky. The primary variant of MTV's logo at the time had the \"M\" in yellow and the \"TV\" in red. However, unlike most television networks' logos at the time, the logo was constantly branded with different colors, patterns, and images on a variety of station IDs. Examples include 1988's ID \"Adam And Eve\", where the \"M\" is an apple and the snake is the \"TV\". And for 1984's ID \"Art History\", the logo is shown in different art styles. The only constant aspects of MTV's logo at the time were its general shape and proportions, with everything else being dynamic.\nMTV launched on August 1, 1981, with an extended network ID featuring the first landing on the Moon (with still images acquired directly from NASA), which was a concept of Seibert's executed by Buzz Potamkin and Perpetual Motion Pictures. The ID then cut to the American flag planted on the Moon's surface changed to show the MTV logo on it, which rapidly changed into different colors and patterns several times per second as the network's original guitar-driven jingle was played for the first time. After MTV's launch, the \"Moon landing\" ID was edited to show only its ending, and was shown at the top of every hour until early 1986, when the ID was scrapped in light of the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" disaster. (since then the space theme and the Moonman became a fixture of MTV\u2019s branding most notably in its award show statue) The ID ran \"more than 75,000 times each year (48 times each day), at the top and bottom of every hour every day\" according to Seibert.\nFrom the late 1990s to the early 2000s, MTV updated its on-air appearance at the beginning of every year and each summer, creating a consistent brand across all of its music-related shows. This style of channel-wide branding came to an end as MTV drastically reduced its number of music-related shows in the early to mid-2000s. Around this time, MTV introduced a static and single color digital on-screen graphic mainly grey during on-air and some color to be shown during all of its programming.\nStarting with the premiere of the short-lived program \"FNMTV: Friday Night MTV\" in 2008, MTV started using an updated and cropped version of its original logo for 30 years during most of its on-air programming. It became MTV's official logo on February 8, 2010, and officially debuted on its website. The channel's full text \"MUSIC TELEVISION\" was eliminated, with the revised and chopped down on the logo largely the same as the original logo, but without the initialism, the bottom of the \"M\" being cropped and the \"V\" in \"TV\" no longer branching off. This change was most likely made to reflect MTV's more prominent focus on reality and comedy programming and less on music-related programming. However, much like the original logo, the new logo was designed to be filled in with a seemingly unlimited variety of images. It is used worldwide, but not everywhere is it used existentially. The new logo was first used on MTV Films logo with the 2010 film \"Jackass 3D\". MTV's rebranding was overseen by Popkern.\nOn June 25, 2015, MTV International rebranded its on-air look with a new vaporwave and seapunk-inspired graphics package. It included a series of new station IDs featuring 3D renderings of objects and people, much akin to vaporwave and seapunk \"aesthetics\". Many have derided MTV's choice of rebranding, insisting that the artistic style was centered on denouncing corporate capitalism (many aesthetic pieces heavily incorporate corporate logos of the 1970s, 80s and 90s, which coincidentally include MTV's original logo) rather than being embraced by major corporations like MTV. Many have also suggested that MTV made an attempt to be relevant in the modern entertainment world with the rebrand. In addition to this, the rebrand was made on exactly the same day that the social media site Tumblr introduced Tumblr TV, an animated GIF viewer which featured branding inspired by MTV's original 1980s on-air look. Tumblr has been cited as a prominent location of aesthetic art, and thus many have suggested MTV and Tumblr \"switched identities\". The rebrand also incorporated a modified version of MTV's classic \"I Want My MTV!\" slogan, changed to read \"I Am My MTV.\" \"Vice\" has suggested that the slogan change represents \"the current generation's movement towards self-examination, identity politics and apparent narcissism.\" MTV also introduced MTV Bump, a website that allows Instagram and Vine users to submit videos to be aired during commercial breaks, as well as MTV Canvas, an online program where users submit custom IDs to also be aired during commercial breaks.\nOn February 5, 2021, MTV began to use a revised logo in tandem with the 2010 version, doing away with the 3D effect inherited from its predecessors (much akin to the current MTV Video Music Awards variant). That logo is revealed to be an alternate variant of the current logo designed by the design agency Loyalkaspar, which pays homage to MTV of the past with the red-yellow-blue color combination and the 3D effect mainly inherited from its predecessor logo. The new logo's rollout was completed in time for the 2021 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\"I Want My MTV!\".\nThe channel's iconic \"I Want My MTV!\" advertising campaign was launched in 1982. It was first developed by George Lois and was based on a cereal commercial from the 1950s with the slogan \"I Want My Maypo!\" that Lois adapted unsuccessfully from the original created by animator John Hubley.\nLois's first pitch to the network was roundly rejected when Lois insisted that rock stars like Mick Jagger should be crying when they said the tag line, not unlike his failed 'Maypo' revamp. His associate, and Seibert mentor Dale Pon, took over the campaign, both strategically and creatively. Pon was able to get the campaign greenlit when he laughed the tears out of the spots. From then on\u2013with the exception of the closely logos on the first round of commercials\u2013Pon was the primary creative force.\nAll the commercials were produced by Buzz Potamkin and his new company Buzzco Productions, directed first by Thomas Schlamme and Alan Goodman and eventually by Candy Kugel.\nThe campaign featured popular artists and celebrities, including Pete Townshend, Pat Benatar, Adam Ant, David Bowie, the Police, Kiss, Culture Club, Billy Idol, Hall &amp; Oates, Cyndi Lauper, Madonna, Lionel Richie, Ric Ocasek, John Mellencamp, Peter Wolf, Joe Elliott, Stevie Nicks, Rick Springfield, and Mick Jagger, interacting with the MTV logo on-air and encouraging viewers to call their pay television providers and request that MTV be added to their local channel lineups. Eventually, the slogan became so ubiquitous that it made an appearance as a lyric sung by Sting on the Dire Straits song \"Money for Nothing\", whose music video aired in regular rotation on MTV when it was first released in 1985 and also served as the first video played on its European arm, and became the basis of the music used in the MTV Entertainment Studios production logo.\nInfluence and controversies.\nThe channel has been a target of criticism by different groups about programming choices, social issues, political correctness, sensitivity, censorship, and a perceived negative social influence on young people. Portions of the content of MTV's programs and productions have come under controversy in the general news media and among social groups that have taken offense. Some within the music industry criticized what they saw as MTV's homogenization of rock 'n' roll, including the punk band the Dead Kennedys, whose song \"M.T.V.\u00a0\u2013 Get Off the Air\" was released on their 1985 album \"Frankenchrist\", just as MTV's influence over the music industry was being solidified. MTV was also the major influence on the growth of music videos during the 1980s.\nBreaking the \"color barrier\".\nDuring MTV's first few years, very few black artists were featured. The select few in MTV's rotation between 1981 and 1984 were Michael Jackson, Prince, Eddy Grant, Tina Turner, Donna Summer, Joan Armatrading, Musical Youth, The Specials, The Selecter, Grace Jones, John Butcher and Herbie Hancock. Mikey Craig of Culture Club, Joe Leeway of Thompson Twins and Tracy Wormworth of The Waitresses were also black. The Specials, which included black and white vocalists and musicians, were also the first act with people of color to perform on MTV; their song \"Rat Race\" was the 58th video on the station's first broadcast day.\nMTV refused other black artists' videos, such as Rick James' \"Super Freak\", because they did not fit the channel's carefully selected album-oriented rock format at the time. The exclusion enraged James, who publicly advocated the addition of more black artists to the channel. David Bowie also questioned MTV's lack of black artists during an on-air interview with VJ Mark Goodman in 1983. MTV's original head of talent and acquisition, Carolyn B. Baker, who was black, questioned why the definition of music had to be so narrow, as did a few others outside the network. Years later, Baker said, \"The party line at MTV was that we weren't playing black music because of the research\u00a0\u2013 but the research was based on ignorance\u2026 We were young, we were cutting-edge. We didn't have to be on the cutting edge of racism.\" Nevertheless, it was Baker who rejected Rick James' \"Super Freak\" video \"because there were half-naked women in it, and it was a piece of crap. As a black woman, I did not want that representing my people as the first black video on MTV.\"\nThe network's director of music programming, Buzz Brindle, told an interviewer in 2006: \"MTV was originally designed to be a rock music channel. It was difficult for MTV to find African American artists whose music fit the channel's format that leaned toward rock at the outset.\" Writers Craig Marks and Rob Tannenbaum noted that the channel \"aired videos by plenty of white artists who didn't play rock.\" Andrew Goodwin later wrote: \"[MTV] denied racism, on the grounds that it merely followed the rules of the rock business.\" MTV senior executive vice president Les Garland complained decades later, \"The worst thing was that 'racism' bullshit... there were hardly any videos being made by black artists. Record companies weren't funding them. \"They\" never got charged with racism.\" However, critics of that defence pointed out that record companies were not funding videos for black artists because they knew they would have difficulty persuading MTV to play them. The book \"The Vault: The Definitive Guide to the Musical World of Prince\", which was co-written by the artist, states that while Bob Pittman had defined the channel\u2019s focus as \u201cstrictly rock and roll\u201d, the network nevertheless picked up the video to Prince\u2019s \u201c1999\u201d on December 16, 1982.\nIn celebrating the 40th anniversary of the network's launch in 2021, current MTV Entertainment Group president Chris McCarthy acknowledged that \"(o)ne of the bigger mistakes in the early years was not playing enough diverse music... but the nice thing that I've always learned at MTV is we have no problem owning our mistakes, quickly correcting them and trying to do the right thing and always follow where the audience is going.\"\nBefore 1983, Michael Jackson also struggled for MTV airtime. To resolve the struggle and finally \"break the color barrier\", the president of CBS Records, Walter Yetnikoff, denounced MTV in a strong, profane statement, threatening to take away its right to play any of the label's music. However, Les Garland, then acquisitions head, said he decided to air Jackson's \"Billie Jean\" video without pressure from CBS, a statement later contradicted by CBS head of Business Affairs David Benjamin in \"Vanity Fair\".\nAccording to \"The Austin Chronicle\", Jackson's video for the song \"Billie Jean\" was \"the video that broke the color barrier, even though the channel itself was responsible for erecting that barrier in the first place.\" But change was not immediate. \"Billie Jean\" was not added to MTV's \"medium rotation\" playlist (two to three airings per day) until it reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. In the final week of March, it was in \"heavy rotation\", one week before the MTV debut of Jackson's \"Beat It\" video. Prince's \"Little Red Corvette\" joined both videos in heavy rotation at the end of April. At the beginning of June, \"Electric Avenue\" by Eddy Grant joined \"Billie Jean,\" which was still in heavy rotation until mid-June. At the end of August, \"She Works Hard for the Money\" by Donna Summer was in heavy rotation on the channel. Herbie Hancock's \"Rockit\" and Lionel Richie's \"All Night Long\" were placed in heavy rotation at the end of October and the beginning of November respectively. In the final week of November, Donna Summer's \"Unconditional Love\" was in heavy rotation. When Jackson's elaborate video for \"Thriller\" was released late that year, raising the bar for what a video could be, the network's support for it was total; subsequently, more pop and R&amp;B videos were played on MTV.\nFollowing Jackson's and Prince's breakthroughs on MTV, Rick James did several interviews where he brushed off the accomplishment as tokenism, saying in a 1983 interview, in an episode of \"\" on James, that \"any black artist that [had] their video played on MTV should pull their [videos] off MTV.\"\nSubsequent concepts.\nHBO also had a 30-minute program of music videos called \"Video Jukebox\", that first aired around the time of MTV's launch and lasted until late 1986. Also around this time, HBO, as well as other premium channels such as Cinemax, Showtime and The Movie Channel, occasionally played one or a few music videos between movies.\nSuperStation WTBS launched \"Night Tracks\" on June 3, 1983, with up to 14 hours of music video airplay each late night weekend by 1985. Its most noticeable difference was that black artists that MTV initially ignored received airplay. The program ran until the end of May 1992.\nPlayboy TV launched their own music video program called \"Playboy's Hot Rocks\" that premiered on July 15, 1983, featuring uncensored versions of music videos that were shown in nightclubs by artists from Duran Duran and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce to Nine Inch Nails and 2Pac. At times, they would do a certain theme like the all Prince theme on the channel back in the 90s.\nA few markets also launched music-only channels, including Las Vegas' KRLR-TV (now KSNV), which debuted in the summer of 1984 and was branded as \"Vusic 21\". The first video played on that channel was \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", following in the footsteps of MTV.\nShortly after TBS began \"Night Tracks\", NBC launched a music video program called \"Friday Night Videos\", which was considered network television's answer to MTV. Later renamed simply \"Friday Night\", the program ran from 1983 to 2002. ABC's contribution to the music video program genre in 1984, \"ABC Rocks\", was far less successful, lasting only a year.\nTBS founder Ted Turner started the Cable Music Channel in 1984, designed to play a broader mix of music videos than MTV's rock format allowed. But after one month as a money-losing venture, Turner sold it to MTV, who redeveloped the channel into VH1.\nThe founders of Financial News Network, Glenn Taylor and Karen Tyler tried to capitalize on the concept by launching Discovery Music Network, which was set to be a cable network, and has plans to set up the Discovery Broadcasting System, which consists of the aforementioned network, along with computer and business networks, but it never got off the ground.\nShortly after its launch, Disney Channel aired a program called \"DTV\", a play on the MTV acronym. The program used music cuts, both from past and upcoming artists. Instead of music videos, the program used clips of various vintage Disney cartoons and animated films (from \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" to \"The Fox and the Hound\") to go with the songs. The program aired in multiple formats, sometimes between shows, sometimes as its own program, and other times as one-off specials. The specials tended to air both on the Disney Channel and NBC. The program aired at several times between 1984 and 1999. In 2009, Disney Channel revived the \"DTV\" concept with a new series of short-form segments called \"Re-Micks\".\nHanna-Barbera created \"HBTV\", similar to \"DTV\" in 1985 and in 1986.\nCensorship.\nMTV has edited a number of music videos to remove nudity, references to drugs, sex, violence, weapons, racism, homophobia, and/or advertising. Many music videos aired on the channel were either censored, moved to late-night rotation, or banned entirely from the channel.\nIn the 1980s, parent media watchdog groups such as the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) criticized MTV over certain music videos that were claimed to have explicit imagery of satanism. As a result, MTV developed a strict policy on refusal to air videos that may depict Satanism or anti-religious themes. This policy led MTV to ban music videos such as \"Jesus Christ Pose\" by Soundgarden in 1991 and \"Megalomaniac\" by Incubus in 2004; however, the controversial band Marilyn Manson was among the most popular rock bands on MTV during the late 1990s and early 2000s.\nOn September 28, 2016, on an AfterBuzz TV live stream, Scout Durwood said that MTV had a \"no appropriation policy\" that forbid her from wearing her hair in cornrows in an episode of \"Mary + Jane\". She said, \"I wanted to cornrow my hair, and they were like, 'That's racist.'\"\nTrademark suit.\nMagyar Telev\u00edzi\u00f3, Hungary's public broadcaster who has a trademark on the initials MTV, registered with the Hungarian copyright office, sued the American MTV (Music Television) network for trademark infringement when the Hungarian version of the music channel was launched in 2007.\nIn 2008 according to the final verdict of the Hungarian Metropolitan Regional Court, although the national public broadcaster and the American entertainment station are identified by the same brand name in the same market, consumers couldn't confuse those TV channels. The two channels appear with the same label in public, but the services of the public broadcaster and the commercial channel cannot be compared either content-wise or stylistically.\nAndrew Dice Clay.\nDuring the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards ceremony, comedian Andrew Dice Clay did his usual \"adult nursery rhymes\" routine (which he had done in his stand-up acts), after which the network executives imposed a lifetime ban. Billy Idol's music video for the song \"Cradle of Love\" originally had scenes from Clay's film \"The Adventures of Ford Fairlane\" when it was originally aired; scenes from the film were later excised. During the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Clay was in attendance where he confirmed that the channel lifted the ban.\n\"Beavis and Butt-Head\".\nIn the wake of controversy that involved a child burning down his house after allegedly watching \"Beavis and Butt-head\", MTV moved the show from its original 7 p.m. time slot to an 11p.m. time slot. Also, Beavis's tendency to flick a lighter and yell \"fire\" was removed from new episodes, and controversial scenes were removed from existing episodes before their rebroadcast. Some extensive edits were noted by series creator Mike Judge after compiling his , saying that \"some of those episodes may not even exist actually in their original form.\"\n\"Dude, This Sucks\".\nA pilot for a show called \"Dude, This Sucks\" was cancelled after teens attending a taping at the Snow Summit Ski Resort in January 2001 were sprayed with liquidized fecal matter by a group known as \"The Shower Rangers\". The teens later sued, with MTV later apologizing and ordering the segment's removal.\nSuper Bowl XXXVIII halftime show.\nAfter Viacom's purchase of CBS, MTV was selected to produce the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show in 2001, airing on CBS and featuring Britney Spears, NSYNC, and Aerosmith. Due to its success, MTV was invited back to produce another halftime show in 2004; this sparked a nationwide debate and controversy that drastically changed Super Bowl halftime shows, MTV's programming, and radio censorship.\nWhen CBS aired Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004, MTV was again chosen to produce the halftime show, with performances by such artists as Nelly, P. Diddy, Janet Jackson, and Justin Timberlake. The show became controversial, however, after Timberlake tore off part of Jackson's outfit while performing \"Rock Your Body\" with her, revealing her right breast. All involved parties apologized for the incident, and Timberlake referred to the incident as a \"wardrobe malfunction\".\nMichael Powell, then-chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), ordered an investigation the day after the broadcast. In the weeks following the halftime show, MTV censored much of its programming. Several music videos, including \"This Love\" and \"I Miss You\", were edited for sexual content. In September 2004, the FCC ruled that the halftime show was indecent and fined CBS $550,000. The FCC upheld it in 2006, but federal judges reversed the fine in 2008.\nNipplegate.\nTimberlake and Jackson's controversial event gave way to a \"wave of self-censorship on American television unrivaled since the McCarthy era\". After the sudden event, names surfaced such as nipplegate, Janet moment, and boobgate, and this spread politically, furthering the discussion into the 2004 presidential election surrounding \"moral values\" and \"media decency\".\nMoral criticism.\nIn 2005, the Parents Television Council (PTC) released a study titled \"MTV Smut Peddlers\", which sought to expose excessive sexual, profane, and violent content on the channel, based on MTV's spring break programming from 2004. Jeanette Kedas, an MTV network executive, called the PTC report \"unfair and inaccurate\" and \"underestimating young people's intellect and level of sophistication\", while L. Brent Bozell III, then-president of the PTC, stated: \"the incessant sleaze on MTV presents the most compelling case yet for consumer cable choice\", referring to the practice of pay television companies to allow consumers to pay for channels \"\u00e0 la carte\".\nIn April 2008, PTC released \"The Rap on Rap\", a study covering hip-hop and R&amp;B music videos rotated on programs \"106 &amp; Park\" and \"Rap City\", both shown on BET, and \"Sucker Free\" on MTV. PTC urged advertisers to withdraw sponsorship of those programs, whose videos PTC stated targeted children and teenagers containing adult content.\n\"Jersey Shore\".\nMTV received significant criticism from Italian American organizations for \"Jersey Shore\", which premiered in 2009. The controversy was due in large part to the manner in which MTV marketed the show, as it liberally used the word \"guido\" to describe the cast members. The word \"guido\" is generally regarded as an ethnic slur when referring to Italians and Italian Americans. One promotion stated that the show was to follow, \"eight of the hottest, tannest, craziest Guidos,\" while yet another advertisement stated, \"\"Jersey Shore\" exposes one of the tri-state area's most misunderstood species\u00a0... the GUIDO. Yes, they really do exist! Our Guidos and Guidettes will move into the ultimate beach house rental and indulge in everything the Seaside Heights, New Jersey scene has to offer.\"\nPrior to the series debut, Unico National formally requested that MTV cancel the show. In a formal letter, the company called the show a \"direct, deliberate and disgraceful attack on Italian Americans.\" Unico National President Andre DiMino said, \"MTV has festooned the 'bordello-like' house set with Italian flags and red, white and green maps of New Jersey while every other cutaway shot is of Italian signs and symbols. They are blatantly as well as subliminally bashing Italian Americans with every technique possible.\" Around this time, other Italian organizations joined the fight, including the NIAF and the Order Sons of Italy in America.\nMTV responded by issuing a press release which stated in part, \"The Italian American cast takes pride in their ethnicity. We understand that this show is not intended for every audience and depicts just one aspect of youth culture.\" Following the calls for the show's removal, several sponsors requested that their ads not be aired during the show. These sponsors included Dell, Domino's Pizza, and American Family Insurance. Despite the loss of certain advertisers, MTV did not cancel the show. Moreover, the show saw its audience increase from its premiere in 2009, and continued to place as MTV's top-rated programs during \"Jersey Shore's\" six-season run, ending in 2012.\nSocial activism.\nIn addition to its regular programming, MTV has a long history of promoting social, political, and environmental activism in young people. The channel's vehicles for this activism have been \"Choose or Lose\", encompassing political causes and encouraging viewers to vote in elections; \"Fight For Your Rights\", encompassing anti-violence and anti-discrimination causes; \"think MTV\"; and \"MTV Act\" and \"Power of 12\", the newest umbrellas for MTV's social activism.\n\"Choose or Lose\".\nIn 1992, MTV started a pro-democracy campaign called \"Choose or Lose\", to encourage over 20 million people to register to vote, and the channel hosted a town hall forum for then-candidate Bill Clinton.\nIn recent years, other politically diverse programs on MTV have included \"True Life\", which documents people's lives and problems, and MTV News specials, which center on very current events in both the music industry and the world. One special show covered the 2004 US presidential election, airing programs focused on the issues and opinions of young people, including a program where viewers could ask questions of Senator John Kerry. MTV worked with P. Diddy's \"Citizen Change\" campaign, designed to encourage young people to vote.\nAdditionally, MTV aired a documentary covering a trip by the musical group Sum 41 to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, documenting the conflict there. The group ended up being caught in the midst of an attack outside of the hotel and was subsequently flown out of the country.\nThe channel also began showing presidential campaign commercials for the first time during the 2008 US presidential election. This has led to criticism, with Jonah Goldberg opining that \"MTV serves as the Democrats' main youth outreach program.\"\n\"Rock the Vote\".\nMTV is aligned with Rock the Vote, a campaign to motivate young adults to register and vote.\n\"MTV Act\" and \"Power of 12\".\nIn 2012, MTV launched \"MTV Act\" and \"Power of 12\", its current social activism campaigns. \"MTV Act\" focuses on a wide array of social issues, while \"Power of 12\" was a replacement for MTV's \"Choose or Lose\" and focused on the 2012 US presidential election.\n\"Elect This\".\nIn 2016, MTV continued its pro-democracy campaign with \"Elect This\", an issue-oriented look at the 2016 election targeting Millennials. Original content under the \"Elect This\" umbrella includes \"Infographica,\" short animations summarizing MTV News polls; \"Robo-Roundtable,\" a digital series hosted by animatronic robots; \"The Racket,\" a multi-weekly digital series; and \"The Stakes,\" a weekly political podcast.\n\"Vote Early Day\".\nIn 2020, MTV was the principal founder of Vote Early Day. Initially, the primary target audience was young voters. The MTV campaign launched with partners across media, consumer brands, and advocacy organizations, and its strength being that it isn't \u2018owned\u2019 by any one entity.\nBeyond MTV.\nSince its launch in 1981, the brand \"MTV\" has expanded and includes many additional properties beyond the original MTV channel, including a variety of sister channels in the US, dozens of affiliated channels around the world, and an Internet presence through MTV.com and related websites.\nSister channels in the United States.\nMTV operates a group of channels under MTV Networks\u00a0\u2013 a name that continues to be used for the individual units of the Paramount Media Networks, a division of corporate parent Paramount Global. In 1985, MTV saw the introduction of its first regular sister channel, VH1, which was originally an acronym for \"Video Hits One\" and was designed to play adult contemporary music videos. VH1 is aimed at celebrity and popular culture programming, which includes many reality shows. Another sister channel, CMT, targets the southern culture market.\nThe advent of satellite television and digital cable brought MTV greater channel diversity, including its sister channels MTV2 and Spanish-speaking MTV Tr3\u0301s (Tr3\u0301s), which initially played music videos exclusively but later focused on other programming. MTV also formerly broadcast MTVU on campuses at various universities until 2018, when the MTV Networks on Campus division was sold, and the channel remained as a digital cable channel only. MTV formerly also had MTV Hits and MTVX channels until these were converted into NickMusic and MTV Jams, respectively. MTV Jams was later rebranded as BET Jams in 2015.\nIn January 2006, MTV launched MTV HD, a 1080i high-definition simulcast feed of MTV. Until Viacom's main master control was upgraded in 2013, only the network's original series after 2010 (with some pre-2010 content) are broadcast in high definition, while music videos, despite being among the first television works to convert to high definition presentation in the mid-2000s, were presented in 4:3 standard definition, forcing them into a windowboxing type of presentation; since that time, all music videos are presented in HD and are framed to their director's preference. \"Jersey Shore\", despite being shot with widescreen HD cameras, was also presented with SD windowboxing (though the 2018 \"\" revival is in full HD). The vast majority of providers carry MTV HD.\nMTV Networks also operates MTV Live, a high-definition channel that features original HD music programming and HD versions of music-related programs from MTV, VH1, and CMT. The channel was launched in January 2006 as MHD (Music: High Definition). The channel was officially rebranded as MTV Live on February 1, 2016.\nIn 2005 and 2006, MTV launched a list of channels for Asian Americans. The first channel was MTV Desi, launched in July 2005, dedicated towards Indian Americans. Next was MTV Chi, in December 2005, which catered to Chinese Americans. The third was MTV K, launched in June 2006 and targeted toward Korean Americans. Each of these channels featured music videos and shows from MTV's international affiliates as well as original US programming, promos, and packaging. All three of these channels ceased broadcasting on April 30, 2007.\nOn August 1, 2016, the 35th anniversary of the original MTV's launch, VH1 Classic was rebranded as MTV Classic. The channel's programming focused on classic music videos and programming (including notable episodes of \"MTV Unplugged\" and \"VH1 Storytellers\"), but skews more towards the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. The network aired encores of former MTV series such as \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" and \"\". The network's relaunch included a broadcast of MTV's first hour on the air, which was also simulcast on MTV and online via Facebook live streaming. MTV Classic only retained three original VH1 Classic programs, which were \"That Metal Show\", \"Metal Evolution,\" and \"Behind the Music Remastered\", although repeats of current and former VH1 programs such as \"Pop-Up Video\" and \"VH1 Storytellers\" remained on the schedule. However, the rebranded MTV Classic had few viewers and declined quickly to become the least-watched English-language subscription network rated by Nielsen at the end of 2016. At the start of 2017, it was reorganized into an all-video network.\nInternet.\nIn the late 1980s, before the internet, MTV VJ Adam Curry began experimenting online. In 1993, he registered the then-unclaimed domain name \"MTV.com\" with the idea of being MTV's unofficial new voice on the Internet. Although this move was sanctioned by his supervisors at MTV Networks at the time, when Curry left to start his own web-portal design and hosting company, MTV subsequently sued him for the domain name, which led to an out-of-court settlement.\nThe service hosted at the domain name was originally branded \"MTV Online\" during MTV's first few years of control over it in the mid-1990s. It served as a counterpart to the America Online portal for MTV content, which existed at AOL keyword MTV until approximately the end of the 1990s. After this time, the website became known as simply \"MTV.com\" and served as the Internet hub for all MTV and MTV News content.\nMTV.com experimented with entirely video-based layouts between 2005 and 2007. The experiment began in April 2005 as \"MTV Overdrive\", a streaming video service that supplemented the regular MTV.com website. Shortly after the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, which were streamed on MTV.com and heavily used the \"MTV Overdrive\" features, MTV introduced a massive change for MTV.com, transforming the entire site into a Flash video-based entity. Much of users' feedback about the Flash-based site was negative, demonstrating a dissatisfaction with videos that played automatically, commercials that could not be skipped or stopped, and the slower speed of the entire website. The experiment ended in February 2007 as MTV.com reverted to a traditional HTML-based website design with embedded video clips, in the style of YouTube and some other video-based websites.\nFrom 2006 to 2007, MTV operated an online channel, MTV International, targeted to the broad international market. The purpose of the online channel was to air commercial-free music videos as television channels began focusing on shows unrelated to music videos or music-related programming.\nThe channel responded to the rise of the Internet as the new central place to watch music videos in October 2008 by launching MTV Music (later called MTV Hive), a website that featured thousands of music videos from MTV and VH1's video libraries, dating back to the earliest videos from 1981.\nA newly created division of the company, MTV New Media, announced in 2008 that it would produce its own original web series, in an attempt to create a bridge between old and new media. The programming is available to viewers via personal computers, cell phones, iPods, and other digital devices.\nIn the summer of 2012, MTV launched a music discovery website called the MTV Artists Platform (also known as Artists.MTV). MTV explained, \"While technology has made it way easier for artists to produce and distribute their own music on their own terms, it hasn't made it any simpler to find a way to cut through all the Internet noise and speak directly to all of their potential fans. The summer launch of the platform is an attempt to help music junkies and musicians close the gap by providing a one-stop place where fans can listen to and buy music and purchase concert tickets and merchandise.\"\nMTV.com remains the official website of MTV, and it expands on the channel's broadcasts by bringing additional content to its viewers. In 2022, it was revised to mostly focus on directing consumers to content on Paramount+ and Pluto TV. The site featured an online version of MTV News and podcasts. It has TV Everywhere authenticated streaming. The news site is defunct but still can be accessed with prior movie features, profiles and interviews with recording artists and from MTV's television programs. A related MTV app was available on mobile platforms and connected TV devices.\nTermination of music programming.\nParent company Paramount announced on October 10, 2025, that its United Kingdom and Ireland channels MTV Music, MTV 80s, MTV 90s, Club MTV, and MTV Live will all stop broadcasting after December 31, 2025. The broadcaster's \"flagship\" channel, MTV HD, will remain on air, showing reality series such as \"Dating Naked UK\", \"Teen Mom\", and \"Geordie Shore\".\nAfter going off the air in the UK and Ireland, the aforementioned MTV channels will be switched off in France, Germany, Austria, Poland, Hungary, Australia, and Brazil, in what Euronews journalist David Mouriquand called \"a sign of changing times\".\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18857", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18857", "title": "Mustelidae", "text": "Family of mammals\nThe Mustelidae (; from Latin , weasel) are a diverse family of carnivoran mammals, including weasels, badgers, otters, polecats, martens, grisons, and wolverines. Otherwise known as mustelids (), they form the largest family in the suborder Caniformia of the order Carnivora with about 66 to 70 species in nine subfamilies.\nVariety.\nMustelids vary greatly in size and behaviour. The smaller variants of the least weasel can be under in length, while the giant otter of Amazonian South America can measure up to and sea otters can exceed in weight. Wolverines can crush bones as thick as the femur of a moose to get at the marrow, and have been seen attempting to drive bears away from their kills. The sea otter uses rocks to break open shellfish to eat. Martens are largely arboreal, while European badgers dig extensive tunnel networks, called setts. Only one mustelid has been domesticated; the ferret. Tayra are also kept as pets (although they require a Dangerous Wild Animals licence in the UK), or as working animals for hunting or vermin control. Others have been important in the fur trade\u2014the mink is often raised for its fur.\nBeing one of the most species-rich families in the order Carnivora, the family Mustelidae also is one of the oldest. Mustelid-like forms first appeared about 40\u00a0million years ago (Mya), roughly coinciding with the appearance of rodents. The common ancestor of modern mustelids appeared about 18\u00a0Mya.\nCharacteristics.\nWithin a large range of variation, the mustelids exhibit some common characteristics. They are typically small animals with elongated bodies, short legs, short skulls, short, round ears, and thick fur. Mustelids' long, slender body structure is adapted to three main lifestyles: terrestrial, arboreal, and aquatic/semi-aquatic. They exhibit digitigrade or plantigrade locomotion, with five toes on each foot, enabling them to move in different ways (i.e. digging, climbing, swimming). Most mustelids are solitary, nocturnal animals, and are active year-round. Their dense fur, often serving as natural camouflage, undergoes seasonal changes to help them adjust to varying environmental conditions.\nWith the exception of the sea otter they have anal scent glands that produce a strong-smelling secretion the animals use for sexual signalling and marking territory.\nMustelids exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males being larger than females, but degree varies between species as well as geographically within species. Male mustelids have a bifurcated penis and baculum. Most mustelid reproduction involves embryonic diapause. The embryo does not immediately implant in the uterus, but remains dormant for some time. No development takes place as long as the embryo remains unattached to the uterine lining. As a result, the normal gestation period is extended, sometimes up to a year. This allows the young to be born under favourable environmental conditions. Reproduction has a large energy cost, so it is to a female's benefit to have available food and mild weather. The young are more likely to survive if birth occurs after previous offspring have been weaned.\nMustelids are predominantly carnivorous, although some eat vegetable matter at times. While not all mustelids share an identical dentition, they all possess teeth adapted for eating flesh, including the presence of shearing carnassials. One characteristic trait is a meat-shearing upper-back molar that is rotated 90\u00b0, towards the inside of the mouth. With variation between species, the most common dental formula is 3.1.3.13.1.3.2.\nEcology.\nThe fisher, tayra, and martens are partially arboreal, while badgers are fossorial. A number of mustelids have aquatic lifestyles, ranging from semiaquatic minks and river otters to the fully aquatic sea otter, which is one of the few nonprimate mammals known to use tools while foraging. It uses \"anvil\" stones to crack open the shellfish that form a significant part of its diet. It is a \"keystone species\", keeping its prey populations in balance so some do not outcompete the others and destroy the kelp in which they live.\nThe black-footed ferret is entirely dependent on another keystone species, the prairie dog. A family of four ferrets eats 250 prairie dogs in a year; this requires a stable population of prairie dogs from an area of some .\nAnimals of similar appearance.\nSkunks were previously included as a subfamily of the mustelids, but DNA research placed them in their own separate family (Mephitidae). Mongooses bear a striking resemblance to many mustelids, but belong to a distinctly different suborder\u2014the Feliformia (all those carnivores sharing more recent origins with the cats) and not the Caniformia (those sharing more recent origins with the dogs). Because mongooses and mustelids occupy similar ecological niches, convergent evolution has led to similarity in form and behavior.\nHuman uses.\nSeveral mustelids, including the mink, the sable (a type of marten), and the stoat (ermine), possess furs that are considered beautiful and valuable, so have been hunted since prehistoric times. From the early Middle Ages, the trade in furs was of great economic importance for northern and eastern European nations with large native populations of fur-bearing mustelids, and was a major economic impetus behind Russian expansion into Siberia and French and English expansion in North America. In recent centuries fur farming, notably of mink, has also become widespread and provides the majority of the fur brought to market.\nOne species, the sea mink (\"Neogale macrodon\") of New England and Canada, was driven to extinction by fur trappers. Its appearance and habits are almost unknown today because no complete specimens can be found and no systematic contemporary studies were conducted.\nThe sea otter, which has the densest fur of any animal, narrowly escaped the fate of the sea mink. The discovery of large populations in the North Pacific was the major economic driving force behind Russian expansion into Kamchatka, the Aleutian Islands, and Alaska, as well as a cause for conflict with Japan and foreign hunters in the Kuril Islands. Together with widespread hunting in California and British Columbia, the species was brought to the brink of extinction until an international moratorium came into effect in 1911.\nToday, some mustelids are threatened for other reasons. Sea otters are vulnerable to oil spills and the indirect effects of overfishing; the black-footed ferret, a relative of the European polecat, suffers from the loss of American prairie; and wolverine populations are slowly declining because of habitat destruction and persecution. The rare European mink (\"Mustela lutreola\") is one of the most endangered mustelid species.\nThe ferret, a domesticated European polecat, is a fairly common pet.\nEvolution and systematics.\nMustelidae is a subfamily in Musteloidia, a superfamily of mammals that is united by shared skull and teeth characteristics. Mustelids are believed to have separated from their next closest related family, Procyonidae, around 29 million years ago. The oldest known mustelid from North America is \"Corumictis wolsani\" from the early and late Oligocene (early and late Arikareean, Ar1\u2013Ar3) of Oregon. Middle Oligocene \"Mustelictis\" from Europe might be a mustelid, as well. Other early fossils of the mustelids were dated at the end of the Oligocene to the beginning of the Miocene. Which of these forms are Mustelidae ancestors and which should be considered the first mustelids is unclear.\nThe fossil record indicates that mustelids appeared in the late Oligocene period (33\u00a0Mya) in Eurasia and migrated to every continent except Antarctica and Australia (all the continents that were connected during or since the early Miocene). They reached the Americas via the Bering land bridge.\nThe 68 recent mustelids (66 extant species) are classified into eight subfamilies in 22 genera:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFossil mustelids\nExtinct genera of the family Mustelidae include:\nPhylogeny.\nMultigene phylogenies constructed by Koepfli et al. (2008) and Law et al. (2018) found that Mustelidae comprises eight living subfamilies. The early mustelids appear to have undergone two rapid bursts of diversification in Eurasia, with the resulting species spreading to other continents only later.\nMustelid species diversity is often attributed to an adaptive radiation coinciding with the mid-Miocene climate transition. Contrary to expectations, Law et al. (2018) found no evidence for rapid bursts of lineage diversification at the origin of the Mustelidae, and further analyses of lineage diversification rates using molecular and fossil-based methods did not find associations between rates of lineage diversification and mid-Miocene climate transition as previously hypothesized.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18858", "revid": "1942604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18858", "title": "Maryland", "text": "U.S. state\nMaryland ( ) is a state in the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic region of the United States. It borders the states of Virginia to its south, West Virginia to its west, Pennsylvania to its north, and Delaware to its east, as well as with the Atlantic Ocean to its east, and the national capital and federal district of Washington, D.C. to the southwest. With a total area of , Maryland is the ninth-smallest state by land area, and its population of 6,177,224 ranks it the 18th-most populous state and the fifth-most densely populated. Maryland's capital city is Annapolis, and the state's most populous city is Baltimore.\nMaryland's coastline was first explored by Europeans in the 16th century. Prior to that, it was inhabited by several Native American tribes, mostly the Algonquian peoples. One of the original Thirteen Colonies, the Province of Maryland was founded in 1634 by George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, a Catholic convert who sought to provide a religious haven for Catholics persecuted in England. In 1632, Charles I of England granted Lord Baltimore a colonial charter, naming the colony after his wife, Henrietta Maria. In 1649, the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act Concerning Religion, which enshrined the principle of toleration. Religious strife was common in Maryland's early years, and Catholics remained a minority, albeit in greater numbers than in any other English colony.\nMaryland's early settlements and population centers clustered around waterways that empty into the Chesapeake Bay. Its economy was heavily plantation-based and centered mostly on the cultivation of tobacco. Demand for cheap labor from Maryland colonists led to the importation of numerous indentured servants and enslaved Africans. In 1760, Maryland's current boundaries took form following the settlement of a long-running border dispute with Pennsylvania. Many of its citizens played key political and military roles in the American Revolutionary War. Although it was a slave state, Maryland remained in the Union during the American Civil War, and its proximity to Washington D.C. and Virginia made it a significant strategic location. After the Civil War ended in 1865, Maryland took part in the Industrial Revolution, driven by its seaports, railroad networks, and mass immigration from Europe.\nSince the 1940s, the state's population has grown rapidly, to approximately six million residents, and it is among the most densely populated U.S. states. As of 2015[ [update]], Maryland had the highest median household income of any state, owing in large part to its proximity to Washington, D.C., and a highly diversified economy spanning manufacturing, retail services, public administration, real estate, higher education, information technology, defense contracting, health care, and biotechnology. Maryland is one of the most multicultural states in the country; it is one of the nine states where non-Whites compose a majority of the population, with the fifth-highest percentage of African Americans, and high numbers of residents born in Africa, Asia, Central America, and the Caribbean. The state's central role in U.S. history is reflected by its hosting of some of the highest numbers of historic landmarks per capita.\nThe western portion of the state contains stretches of the Appalachian Mountains, the central portion is primarily composed of the Piedmont, and the eastern side of the state makes up a significant portion of the Chesapeake Bay. Sixteen of Maryland's twenty-three counties, and the city of Baltimore, border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary and its many tributaries, which combined total more than 4,000 miles of shoreline. Although one of the smallest states in the U.S., it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of \"America in Miniature\". Maryland's geography, culture, and history are diverse, including elements of the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern, and Southern regions of the country.\nHistory.\n17th century.\nMaryland's first colonial settlement.\nPresent-day Maryland was originally inhabited by tribes such as the Piscataway (including the Patuxent), the Nanticoke (including the Tocwogh, the Ozinie and other subdivisions), the Powhatan, the Lenape, the Susquehannock, the Shawnee, the Tutelo, the Saponi, the Pocomoke and the Massawomeck. George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore (1579\u20131632), sought a charter from King Charles I for the territory between Massachusetts to the north and Virginia to the immediate south.\nAfter Baltimore died in April 1632, the charter was granted to his son, Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (1605\u20131675), on June 20, 1632. Officially, the new \"Maryland Colony\" was named in honor of Henrietta Maria of France, wife of Charles I. Lord Baltimore initially proposed the name \"Crescentia\", the land of growth or increase, but \"the King proposed Terra Mariae [Mary Land], which was concluded on and inserted in the bill.\"\nThe original capital of Maryland was St. Mary's City, on the north shore of the Potomac River, and the county surrounding it was the first erected and created in the province, first called Augusta Carolina, after the King, and later named St. Mary's County.\nLord Baltimore's first settlers arrived in the new colony in March 1634, with his younger brother, Leonard Calvert (1606\u20131647), as the first provincial Governor of Maryland. They made their first permanent settlement at St. Mary's City in what is now St. Mary's County. They purchased the site from the paramount chief of the region, who was eager to establish trade. St. Mary's became the first capital of Maryland, and remained so for 60 years until 1695. More settlers soon followed. Their tobacco crops were successful and quickly made the new colony profitable. However, given the incidence of malaria, yellow fever, and typhoid, life expectancy in Maryland was about 10 years less than in New England.\nPersecution of Catholics.\nMaryland was founded to provide a haven for England's Roman Catholic minority.\nAlthough Maryland was the most heavily Catholic of the English mainland colonies, the religion was still in the minority, consisting of less than 10% of the total population.\nIn 1642, several Puritans left Virginia for Maryland and founded the city of Providence, now called Annapolis, on the western shore of the upper Chesapeake Bay. A dispute with traders from Virginia over Kent Island in the Chesapeake led to armed conflict. In 1644, William Claiborne, a Puritan, seized Kent Island while his associate, the pro-Parliament Puritan Richard Ingle, took over St. Mary's. Both used religion as a tool to gain popular support. The two years from 1644 to 1646 when Claiborne and his Puritan associates held sway were known as \"The Plundering Time\". They captured Jesuit priests, imprisoned them, and then sent them back to England.\nIn 1646, Leonard Calvert returned with troops, recaptured St. Mary's City, and restored order. The House of Delegates passed the \"Act concerning Religion\" in 1649, granting religious liberty to all Trinitarian Christians.\nIn 1650, the Puritans revolted against the proprietary government. \"Protestants swept the Catholics out of the legislature... and religious strife returned.\" The Puritans set up a new government prohibiting both Roman Catholicism and Anglicanism. The Puritan revolutionary government persecuted Maryland Catholics during its reign, known as the \"plundering time\". Mobs burned down all the original Catholic churches of southern Maryland. The Puritan rule lasted until 1658, when the Calvert family and Lord Baltimore regained proprietary control and re-enacted the Toleration Act.\nAfter England's Glorious Revolution in 1688, Maryland outlawed Catholicism. In 1704, the Maryland General Assembly prohibited Catholics from operating schools, limited the corporate ownership of property to hamper religious orders from expanding or supporting themselves, and encouraged the conversion of Catholic children. The celebration of the Catholic sacraments was also officially restricted. This state of affairs lasted until after the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783). Wealthy Catholic planters built chapels on their land to practice their religion in relative secrecy.\nInto the 18th century, individual priests and lay leaders claimed Maryland farms belonging to the Jesuits as personal property and bequeathed them to evade the legal restrictions on religious organizations' owning property.\nBorder disputes (1681\u20131760).\nThe royal charter granted Maryland the land north of the Potomac River up to the 40th parallel. A problem arose when Charles II granted a charter for the Province of Pennsylvania, which defined Pennsylvania's southern border as the 40th parallel, identical to Maryland's northern border. But the grant indicated that Charles II and William Penn assumed the 40th parallel would pass close to New Castle, Delaware, where it falls north of Philadelphia, which Penn already designated as Pennsylvania's capital city. Negotiations ensued after the problem was discovered in 1681.\nA compromise proposed by Charles II in 1682 was undermined by Penn's receiving the additional grant of what is now Delaware. Penn successfully argued that the Maryland charter entitled Lord Baltimore only to unsettled lands, and Dutch settlement in Delaware predated his charter. The dispute remained unresolved for nearly a century, carried on by the descendants of William Penn and Lord Baltimore\u2014the Calvert family, which controlled Maryland, and the Penn family, which controlled Pennsylvania.\nThe border dispute with Pennsylvania led to Cresap's War in the 1730s. Hostilities erupted in 1730 and escalated through the first half of the decade, culminating in the deployment of military forces by Maryland in 1736 and by Pennsylvania in 1737. The armed phase of the conflict ended in May 1738 with the intervention of King George II, who compelled the negotiation of a cease-fire. A provisional agreement had been established in 1732.\nNegotiations continued until a final agreement was signed in 1760. The agreement defined the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania as the line of latitude now known as the Mason\u2013Dixon line. Maryland's border with Delaware was based on the Transpeninsular Line and the Twelve-Mile Circle around New Castle.\n18th century.\nMost of the English colonists arrived in Maryland as indentured servants, and had to serve a several-year term as laborers to pay for their passage. In the early years, the line between indentured servants and African slaves or laborers was fluid, and white and black laborers commonly lived and worked together, and formed unions. Mixed-race children born to white mothers were considered free by the principle of \"partus sequitur ventrem\", by which children took the social status of their mothers, a principle of slave law that was adopted throughout the colonies, following Virginia in 1662.\nMany of the free black families migrated to Delaware, where land was cheaper. As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in England, planters in Maryland imported thousands more slaves and racial caste lines hardened.\nMaryland was one of the thirteen colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution. Near the end of the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783), on February 2, 1781, Maryland became the last and 13th state to approve the ratification of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, first proposed in 1776 and adopted by the Second Continental Congress in 1778, which brought into being the United States as a united, sovereign and national state. It also became the seventh state admitted to the Union after ratifying the new federal Constitution in 1788. In December 1790, prior to the move of the national capital from Philadelphia in 1800, Maryland donated land selected by first President George Washington to the federal government for its creation. The land was provided along the north shore of the Potomac River from Montgomery and Prince George's counties, as well as from Fairfax County and Alexandria on the south shore of the Potomac in Virginia; however, the land donated by the Commonwealth of Virginia was later returned to that state by the District of Columbia retrocession in 1846.\n19th century.\nInfluenced by a changing economy, revolutionary ideals, and preaching by ministers, numerous planters in Maryland freed their slaves in the 20 years after the Revolutionary War. Across the Upper South the free black population increased from less than 1% before the war to 14% by 1810. Abolitionists Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass were born slaves during this time in Dorchester County and Talbot County, respectively.\nDuring the War of 1812, the British military attempted to capture Baltimore, which was protected by Fort McHenry. During its bombardment, the song \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was written by Francis Scott Key; it was later adopted as the national anthem.\nNational Road, later renamed U.S. Route 40, was authorized in 1817 as the federal highway, and ran from Baltimore to St. Louis. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the first chartered railroad in the United States, opened its first section of track for regular operation in 1830 between Baltimore and Ellicott City, and in 1852 it became the first rail line to reach the Ohio River from the eastern seaboard.\nCivil War.\nThe state remained in the Union during the American Civil War, due in significant part to demographics and Federal intervention. The 1860 census, held shortly before the outbreak of the civil war, showed that 49% of Maryland's African Americans were free.\nGovernor Thomas Holliday Hicks suspended the state legislature, and to help ensure the election of a new pro-union governor and legislature, President Abraham Lincoln had a number of its pro-slavery politicians arrested, including the Mayor of Baltimore, George William Brown; suspended several civil liberties, including \"habeas corpus\"; and ordered artillery placed on Federal Hill overlooking Baltimore.\nIn April 1861, Federal units and state regiments were attacked as they marched through Baltimore, sparking the Baltimore riot of 1861, the first bloodshed in the Civil War. The largest and most significant battle in the state was the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, near Sharpsburg. Although a tactical draw, the battle was considered a strategic Union victory and a turning point of the war.\nPost-Civil War.\nA new state constitution in 1864 abolished slavery and Maryland was first recognized as a \"Free State\" in that context. Following passage of constitutional amendments that granted voting rights to freedmen, in 1867 the state extended suffrage to non-white males.\nThe Democratic Party rapidly regained power in the state from Republicans. Democrats replaced the Constitution of 1864 with the Constitution of 1867. Following the end of Reconstruction in 1877, Democrats devised means of disenfranchising blacks, initially by physical intimidation and voter fraud, later by constitutional amendments and laws. Blacks and immigrants, however, resisted Democratic Party disfranchisement efforts in the state. Maryland blacks were part of a biracial Republican coalition elected to state government in 1896\u20131904 and comprised 20% of the electorate.\nCompared to some other states, blacks were better established both before and after the civil war. Nearly half the black population was free before the war, and some had accumulated property. Half the population lived in cities. Literacy was high among blacks and, as Democrats crafted means to exclude them, suffrage campaigns helped reach blacks and teach them how to resist. Whites did impose racial segregation in public facilities and Jim Crow laws, which effectively lasted until the passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.\nBaltimore grew significantly during the Industrial Revolution, due in large part to its seaport and good railroad connections, attracting European immigrant labor. Many manufacturing businesses were established in the Baltimore area after the Civil War. Baltimore businessmen, including Johns Hopkins, Enoch Pratt, George Peabody, and Henry Walters, founded notable city institutions that bear their names, including respectively a university, library system, music and dance conservatory, and art museum.\nCumberland was Maryland's second-largest city in the 19th century. Nearby supplies of natural resources along with railroads fostered its growth into a major manufacturing center.\n20th century.\nThe Progressive Era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought political reforms. In a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908, reformers worked for standard state-issued ballots (rather than those distributed and marked by the parties); obtained closed voting booths to prevent party workers from \"assisting\" voters; initiated primary elections to keep party bosses from selecting candidates; and had candidates listed without party symbols, which discouraged the illiterate from participating. These measures worked against ill-educated whites and blacks. The measures were led by the Democratic Party, which sought to disenfranchise Blacks, who were becoming an important part of the Republican Party. Blacks resisted such efforts, with suffrage groups conducting voter education.\nBlacks defeated three efforts to disenfranchise them, making alliances with immigrants to resist various Democratic campaigns. Disenfranchisement bills in 1905, 1907, and 1911 were rebuffed, in large part because of black opposition. Blacks comprised 20% of the electorate and immigrants comprised 15%, and the legislature had difficulty devising requirements against blacks that did not also disadvantage immigrants.\nThe Progressive Era also brought reforms in working conditions for Maryland's labor force. In 1902, the state regulated conditions in mines; outlawed child laborers under the age of 12; mandated compulsory school attendance; and enacted the nation's first workers' compensation law. The workers' compensation law was overturned in the courts, but was redrafted and finally enacted in 1910.\nThe Great Baltimore Fire of 1904 burned for more than 30 hours, destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks. More than 1,231 firefighters worked to bring the blaze under control.\nWith the nation's entry into World War I in 1917, new military bases such as Camp Meade, the Aberdeen Proving Ground, and the Edgewood Arsenal were established. Existing facilities, including Fort McHenry, were greatly expanded.\nAfter Georgia congressman William D. Upshaw criticized Maryland openly in 1923 for not passing Prohibition laws, \"Baltimore Sun\" editor Hamilton Owens coined the \"Free State\" nickname for Maryland in that context, which was popularized by H. L. Mencken in a series of newspaper editorials.\nMaryland's urban and rural communities had different experiences during the Great Depression. The \"Bonus Army\" marched through the state in 1932 on its way to Washington, D.C. Maryland instituted its first income tax in 1937 to generate revenue for schools and welfare.\nPassenger and freight steamboat service, once important throughout Chesapeake Bay and its many tributary rivers, ended in 1962.\nBaltimore was a major war production center during World War II. The biggest operations were Bethlehem Steel's Fairfield Yard, which built Liberty ships; and Glenn Martin, an aircraft manufacturer.\nMaryland experienced population growth following World War II. Beginning in the 1960s, as suburban growth took hold around Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, the state began to take on a more mid-Atlantic culture as opposed to the traditionally Southern and Tidewater culture that previously dominated most of the state. Agricultural tracts gave way to residential communities, some of them carefully planned such as Columbia, St. Charles, and Montgomery Village. Concurrently the Interstate Highway System was built throughout the state, most notably I-95, I-695, and the Capital Beltway, altering travel patterns. In 1952, the eastern and western halves of Maryland were linked for the first time by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, which replaced a nearby ferry service.\nMaryland's regions experienced economic changes following WWII. Heavy manufacturing declined in Baltimore. In Maryland's four westernmost counties, industrial, railroad, and coal mining jobs declined. On the lower Eastern Shore, family farms were bought up by major concerns and large-scale poultry farms and vegetable farming became prevalent. In Southern Maryland, tobacco farming nearly vanished due to suburban development and a state tobacco buy-out program in the 1990s.\nIn an effort to reverse depopulation due to the loss of working-class industries, Baltimore initiated urban renewal projects in the 1960s with Charles Center and the Baltimore World Trade Center. Some resulted in the break-up of intact residential neighborhoods, producing social volatility, and some older residential areas around the harbor have had units renovated and have become popular with new populations.\nGeography.\nMaryland has an area of and is comparable in overall area with Belgium. It is the 42nd-largest and 9th-smallest state and is closest in size to the state of Hawaii that, with its , is the next smallest state. The next largest state is Maryland's neighbor, West Virginia, which is nearly twice the size of Maryland with its area of .\nDescription.\nMaryland possesses a variety of topography within its borders, contributing to its nickname \"America in Miniature\". It ranges from sandy dunes dotted with seagrass in the east, to low marshlands teeming with wildlife and large bald cypress near the Chesapeake Bay, to gently rolling hills of oak forests in the Piedmont Region, and pine groves in the Maryland mountains to the west.\nMaryland is bounded on its north by Pennsylvania, on its north and east by Delaware, on its east by the Atlantic Ocean, and on its south and west, across the Potomac River, by West Virginia and Virginia. The mid-portion of its border with Virginia is interrupted by Washington, D.C., which sits on land that was originally part of Montgomery and Prince George's counties and including Georgetown, Maryland, which was ceded to the United States federal government in 1790 to form the Washington, D.C. Chesapeake Bay nearly bisects the state, and the counties east of the bay are known collectively as the Eastern Shore.\nMost of the state's waterways are part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, with the exceptions of a tiny portion of extreme western Garrett County (drained by the Youghiogheny River as part of the watershed of the Mississippi River), the eastern half of Worcester County (which drains into Maryland's Atlantic coastal bays), and a small portion of the state's northeast corner (which drains into the Delaware River watershed). So prominent is the Chesapeake in Maryland's geography and economic life that there has been periodic agitation to change the state's official nickname to the \"Bay State\", a nickname that has been used by Massachusetts for decades.\nThe highest point in Maryland, with an elevation of , is Hoye Crest on Backbone Mountain, in the southwest corner of Garrett County, near the border with West Virginia, and near the headwaters of the North Branch of the Potomac River. Close to the small town of Hancock, in western Maryland, about two-thirds of the way across the state, less than separates its borders, the Mason\u2013Dixon line to the north, and the northwards-arching Potomac River to the south.\nPortions of Maryland are included in various official and unofficial geographic regions. For example, the Delmarva Peninsula is composed of the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland, the entire state of Delaware, and the two counties that make up the Eastern Shore of Virginia, whereas the westernmost counties of Maryland are considered part of Appalachia. Much of the Baltimore\u2013Washington corridor lies just south of the Piedmont in the Coastal Plain, though it straddles the border between the two regions.\nGeology.\nEarthquakes in Maryland are infrequent and small due to the state's distance from seismic/earthquake zones. The M5.8 Virginia earthquake in 2011 was felt moderately throughout Maryland. Buildings in the state are not well-designed for earthquakes and can suffer damage easily. As well as this, notably a M4.8 earthquake from Tewksbury in central New Jersey was felt slightly throughout Maryland.\nMaryland has no natural lakes, mostly due to the lack of glacial history in the area. All lakes in the state today were constructed, mostly via dams. Buckel's Bog is believed by geologists to have been a remnant of a former natural lake.\nMaryland has shale formations containing natural gas, where fracking is theoretically possible.\nFlora.\nAs is typical of states on the East Coast, Maryland's plant life is abundant and healthy. An adequate volume of annual precipitation helps to support many types of plants, including seagrass and various reeds at the smaller end of the spectrum to the gigantic Wye Oak, a huge example of white oak, the state tree, which can grow over tall.\nMiddle Atlantic coastal forests, typical of the southeastern Atlantic coastal plain, grow around Chesapeake Bay and on the Delmarva Peninsula. Moving west, a mixture of Northeastern coastal forests and Southeastern mixed forests cover the central part of the state. The Appalachian Mountains of western Maryland are home to Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests. These give way to Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests near the West Virginia border.\nMany foreign species are cultivated in the state, some as ornamentals, others as novelty species. Included among these are the crape myrtle, Italian cypress, southern magnolia, live oak in the warmer parts of the state, and even hardy palm trees in the warmer central and eastern parts of the state. USDA plant hardiness zones in the state range from Zones 5and6 in the extreme western part of the state to Zone7 in the central part, and Zone8 around the southern part of the coast, the bay area, and parts of metropolitan Baltimore. Invasive plant species, such as kudzu, tree of heaven, multiflora rose, and Japanese stiltgrass, stifle growth of endemic plant life. Maryland's state flower, the black-eyed susan, grows in abundance in wild flower groups throughout the state.\nFauna.\nThe state harbors a considerable number of white-tailed deer, especially in the woody and mountainous west of the state, and overpopulation can become a problem. Mammals can be found ranging from the mountains in the west to the central areas and include black bears, bobcats, foxes, coyotes, raccoons, and otters.\nThere is a population of rare wild (feral) horses found on Assateague Island. They are believed to be descended from horses that escaped from Spanish galleon shipwrecks. Every year during the last week of July, they are captured and swim across a shallow bay for sale at Chincoteague, Virginia, a conservation technique which ensures the tiny island is not overrun by the horses. The ponies and their sale were popularized by the children's book, \"Misty of Chincoteague.\"\nThe purebred Chesapeake Bay Retriever dog was bred specifically for water sports, hunting and search and rescue in the Chesapeake area. In 1878, the Chesapeake Bay Retriever was the first individual retriever breed recognized by the American Kennel Club. and was later adopted by the University of Maryland, Baltimore County as their mascot.\nMaryland's reptile and amphibian population includes the diamondback terrapin turtle, which was adopted as the mascot of University of Maryland, College Park, as well as the threatened Eastern box turtle. The state is part of the territory of the Baltimore oriole, which is the official state bird and mascot of the MLB team the Baltimore Orioles. Aside from the oriole, 435 other species of birds have been reported from Maryland.\nThe state insect is the Baltimore checkerspot butterfly, although it is not as common in Maryland as it is in the southern edge of its range.\nEnvironment.\nMaryland joined with neighboring states during the end of the 20th century to improve the health of the Chesapeake Bay. The bay's aquatic life and seafood industry have been threatened by development and by fertilizer and livestock waste entering the bay.\nIn 2007, Forbes.com rated Maryland as the fifth \"Greenest\" state in the country, behind three of the Pacific States and Vermont. Maryland ranks 40th in total energy consumption nationwide, and it managed less toxic waste per capita than all but six states in 2005. In April 2007, Maryland joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) \u2014 a regional initiative, formed by all the Northeastern states, Washington, D.C., and three Canadian provinces, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In March 2017, Maryland became the first state with proven gas reserves to ban fracking by passing a law against it. Vermont has such a law, but no shale gas, and New York has such a ban, though it was made by executive order.\nIn 2023, AES Corporation announced its intent to retire the 23-year-old Warrior Run coal plant in June 2024. It was the state's last coal-fired power plant that did not already have plans to shut down.\nClimate.\nMaryland has a wide array of climates, due to local variances in elevation, proximity to water, and protection from colder weather due to downslope winds.\nThe eastern half of Maryland, which includes Ocean City, Salisbury, Annapolis, and the southern and eastern suburbs of Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, lies on the Atlantic Coastal Plain, with flat topography and sandy or muddy soil. This region has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfa\"), with hot, humid summers and cool to cold winters; it falls under USDA Hardiness zone 8a.\nThe Piedmont region, which includes northern and western greater Baltimore, Westminster, Gaithersburg, Frederick, and Hagerstown, has average seasonal snowfall totals generally exceeding , and, as part of USDA Hardiness zones 7b and 7a, temperatures below are less rare. From the Cumberland Valley on westward, the climate begins to transition to a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Dfa\").\nIn Western Maryland, the higher elevations of Allegany and Garrett counties, including the cities of Cumberland, Frostburg, and Oakland, display more characteristics of the humid continental zone, due in part to elevation. They fall under USDA Hardiness zones 6b and below.\nPrecipitation in the state is characteristic of the East Coast. Annual rainfall ranges from with more in higher elevations. Nearly every part of Maryland receives per month of rain. Average annual snowfall varies from in the coastal areas to over in the western mountains of the state.\nBecause of its location near the Atlantic Coast, Maryland is somewhat vulnerable to tropical cyclones, although the Delmarva Peninsula and the outer banks of North Carolina provide a large buffer, such that strikes from major hurricanes (category3 or above) occur infrequently. More often, Maryland gets the remnants of a tropical system that has already come ashore and released most of its energy. Maryland averages around 30\u201340 days of thunderstorms a year, and averages around six tornado strikes annually.\nCities and metro areas.\nMost of the population of Maryland lives in the central region of the state, in the Baltimore metropolitan area and Washington metropolitan area, both of which are part of the Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area. The majority of Maryland's population is concentrated in the cities and suburbs surrounding Washington, D.C., and in and around Baltimore, Maryland's most populous city. Historically, these and many other Maryland cities developed along the Fall Line, the line along which rivers, brooks, and streams are interrupted by rapids and waterfalls. Maryland's capital city, Annapolis, is one exception to this pattern since it lies along the banks of the Severn River, close to where it empties into the Chesapeake Bay.\nThe Eastern Shore is less populous and more rural, as are the counties of western Maryland. The two westernmost counties of Maryland, Allegany and Garrett, are mountainous and sparsely populated, resembling West Virginia and Appalachia more than they do the rest of the state. Both eastern and western Maryland are, however, dotted with cities of regional importance, such as Ocean City, Princess Anne, and Salisbury on the Eastern Shore and Cumberland, Frostburg, and Hancock in Western Maryland. Southern Maryland is still somewhat rural, but suburbanization from Washington, D.C., has encroached significantly since the 1960s; important local population centers include Lexington Park, Prince Frederick, California, and Waldorf.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn the 2020 United States census, the United States Census Bureau found that population of Maryland was 6,185,278 people, a 7.1% increase from the 2010 United States census. The United States Census Bureau estimated that the population of Maryland was 6,045,680 on July 1, 2019, a 4.71% increase from the 2010 United States census and an increase of 2,962, from the prior year. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 269,166 (464,251 births minus 275,093 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 116,713 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 129,730 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 13,017 people. In 2018, The top countries of origin for Maryland's immigrants were El Salvador (11%), India (6%), China (5%), Nigeria (5%), and the Philippines (4%). The center of population of Maryland is located on the county line between Anne Arundel County and Howard County, in the unincorporated community of Jessup.\nMaryland's history as a border state has led it to exhibit characteristics of both the Northern and the Southern regions of the United States. Generally, rural Western Maryland between the West Virginian Panhandle and Pennsylvania has an Appalachian culture; the Southern and Eastern Shore regions of Maryland embody a Southern culture, while densely populated Central Maryland \u2013 radiating outward from Baltimore and Washington, D.C. \u2013 has more in common with that of the Northeast. The U.S. Census Bureau designates Maryland as one of the South Atlantic States, but it is commonly associated with the Mid-Atlantic States and Northeastern United States by other federal agencies, the media, and some residents.\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 5,349 homeless people in Maryland.\nBirth data.\nAs of 2011, 58.0 percent of Maryland's population younger than age1 were minority background.\n\"Note: Births in the table do not add up because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.\"\nSince 2016, data for births of White Hispanic origin are not collected, but included in one \"Hispanic\" group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.\nLanguage and ancestry.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of 2016, the most spoken languages in Maryland other than English were Spanish (9%), Chinese (1.2%), West African languages (mostly Yoruba and Igbo, 1%), French (1%), Korean (0.7%), Afro-Asiatic languages (mostly Amharic, 0.6% and Arabic, 0.4%), and Tagalog (0.6%). Other languages with a large number of speakers in Maryland include Vietnamese (0.4%), Russian (0.4%), Hindi (0.3%), Urdu (0.3%), Persian (0.3%), Nepali (0.3%), Haitian Creole (0.2%), and Telugu (0.2%).\nIn 1970, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Maryland's population as 17.8 percent African-American and 80.4 percent non-Hispanic White.\nIn 2019, non-Hispanic white Americans were 49.8% of Maryland's population (White Americans, including White Hispanics, were 57.3%), which made Maryland a majority minority state. 50.2% of Maryland's population is non-white, or is Hispanic or Latino, the highest percentage of any state on the East Coast, and the highest percentage after the majority-minority states of Hawaii, New Mexico, Texas, California, Nevada, and Washington, D.C. By 2031, minorities are projected to become the majority of voting eligible residents of Maryland. Maryland's multiculturalism and diversity can be explained by its historically large African American population, and immigration brought by the importance of the D.C. and Baltimore areas, especially from Central America, Africa, the Caribbean, and Asia.\nAfrican Americans form a sizable portion of the state's population, 31.1% as of 2020. Most are descendants of people transported to the area as slaves from West Africa. Concentrations of African Americans live in Baltimore City, Prince George's County, Charles County, western parts of Baltimore County, and the southern Eastern Shore. Charles County and Prince George's County are the two counties where African Americans are the most successful monetarily in the country, with average household incomes much higher than in the rest of the country. As a former slave state, Maryland has had a large African-American population for much of its history; African American populations have increased over time with the Great Migration to the D.C. and Baltimore areas, and in more recent times with the New Great Migration and with movement out from Washington D.C. into Montgomery, Prince George's, and Charles counties, as a result of gentrification and rising housing costs in D.C. causing many African Americans to leave. Prince George's County in particular has been a magnet for African Americans from D.C. to move to for decades; it is often referred to as \"Ward 9\" of D.C.\nMaryland has by far the highest percentage of residents born in Africa out of any state; residents of African descent include 20th-century and later immigrants from Nigeria, particularly of the Igbo and Yoruba tribes; Ethiopia, particularly Amharas with significant Oromo and Tigrayan populations; Cameroon, Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Kenya. Maryland also hosts populations from other African and Caribbean nations. Maryland's African immigrant population is generally well-educated and is most concentrated in the inner suburbs of Baltimore and D.C. Nigerians are the fourth-largest immigrant group in Maryland, and are largely concentrated in the Baltimore area and surrounding suburbs, as well as Prince George's county. Many immigrants from the Horn of Africa, especially Ethiopia, have settled in Maryland, with large communities in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., particularly in Montgomery and Prince George's counties. The Washington metropolitan area has the world's largest population of Ethiopians outside of Ethiopia. The Ethiopian community of Greater D.C. was historically based in the Adams Morgan and Shaw neighborhoods of Washington, D.C., but as the community has grown, many Ethiopians have settled in Silver Spring. The Ethiopian American population in Maryland and the rest of the D.C. area is largely Amharic-speaking, but there are significant numbers of speakers of Oromo and Tigrinya speakers as well. The Washington metropolitan area is also home to a large Eritrean community.\nThe top reported ancestries by Maryland residents are: German (15%), Irish (11%), English (8%), American (7%), Italian (6%), and Polish (3%).\nIrish American populations can be found throughout the Baltimore area, and the Northern and Eastern suburbs of Washington, D.C., in Maryland, who were descendants of those who moved out to the suburbs of Washington, D.C.'s once predominantly Irish neighborhoods), as well as Western Maryland, where Irish immigrant laborers helped to build the B&amp;O Railroad. Smaller but much older Irish populations can be found in Southern Maryland, with some roots dating as far back as the early Maryland colony. This population, however, still remains culturally very active and yearly festivals are held.\nMore recent European immigrants of the late 19th and early 20th century settled first in Baltimore, attracted to its industrial jobs. These groups were largely of Jewish, Italian, Greek, Polish, Czech, Lithuanian, Russian and Ukrainian descent. The Greek community includes a number of Greek Jews. \nThe shares of European immigrants born in Eastern Europe increased significantly between 1990 and 2010. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia, many immigrants from Eastern Europe came to the United States\u201412 percent of whom currently reside in Maryland.\nHispanic immigrants of the later 20th century have settled in Aspen Hill, Hyattsville/Langley Park, Glenmont/Wheaton, Bladensburg, Riverdale Park, Gaithersburg, as well as Highlandtown and Greektown in East Baltimore. Maryland has the highest percentage of residents of Central American origin of any state. Salvadorans are the largest Hispanic group in Maryland, and Maryland has the largest percentage of Salvadoran residents of any state. The D.C. area also has the highest percentage of Salvadorans of any American metro area, who are particularly concentrated in Prince George's and Montgomery counties, and has the second-highest total number of Salvadorans after the Los Angeles area. Other Hispanic groups with significant populations in the state include Mexicans, Guatemalans, Hondurans, Dominicans, Peruvians, and Puerto Ricans, along with growing populations of Brazilians, Colombians, Ecuadorians, and Bolivians. Maryland's Hispanic population is especially concentrated in Montgomery County and Prince George's County, with other large populations in the Baltimore area and Frederick County. Maryland has one of the most diverse Hispanic populations in the country, with significant populations from various Caribbean and Central American nations.\nCaribbean Americans have a significant presence in Maryland, especially Jamaican Americans, who make up 0.6% of the population and have had a significant presence and influence in Maryland's politics and culture; Maryland's current governor, Wes Moore, is the son of a Jamaican immigrant mother. Other Caribbean American nationalities with a large population in Maryland include Dominicans, Haitians, Trinidadians and Tobagonians, and Guyanese. Caribbean Americans are most concentrated in Prince George's County, the city of Baltimore, Baltimore County, and Montgomery County. Maryland is home to nearly 17,000 Haitians, according to 2023 Census Bureau data. Roughly 4,200 live in Wicomico County, Maryland, which includes Salisbury. Trinidadians and Tobagonians are concentrated in Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and Prince George's County. There are growing Caribbean populations in Columbia and Waldorf.\nAsian Americans are concentrated in the suburban counties surrounding Washington, D.C., and in Baltimore suburbs, especially Howard County, with Chinese American, Korean American and Taiwanese American communities in Rockville, Gaithersburg, and Germantown. Chinese in particular form the second largest group of Asian Americans, and are the largest group in Montgomery County. Maryland also has a large Korean American population, especially in Howard County, where there is a Koreatown in Ellicott City. Filipino Americans, the largest group of Southeast Asians, form major communities in Montgomery, Prince George's, and Charles counties; other large groups of Southeast Asians include Vietnamese, who are concentrated in Montgomery County, and Burmese, who are concentrated in Frederick, Howard, and Baltimore Counties. Maryland has a very large and diverse South Asian American population that has had a major presence in the state since the 1970s. Indian Americans are the largest Asian group in Maryland, making up 1.7 percent of the population, and live throughout the state, especially in Montgomery and Howard counties, with large numbers in Baltimore, Frederick, and Prince George's counties. The Indian American population is culturally and linguistically diverse, with the Indian languages spoken most being Hindi, Gujarati, Telugu, and Tamil. There are also large Pakistani American populations throughout the D.C. and Baltimore areas, especially in Baltimore County and Howard County, and a large Bangladeshi American community in the D.C. area. Maryland has one of the largest populations of Nepali Americans, including Bhutanese Americans of Nepali descent, in the U.S., many of whom are recent immigrants or refugees who sought asylum after expulsion from Bhutan or the 2015 Nepal earthquake; there are an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 Nepalis in Maryland, concentrated in the Baltimore area with significant populations in the D.C. area. The first Nepali American elected to a state legislature, Harry Bhandari, was elected in Maryland, representing part of Baltimore County. There are three state-recognized tribes, and in 2020, 31,845 identified as being Native American alone, and 96,805 did in combination with one or more other races.\nAttracting educated Asians and Africans to the professional jobs in the region, Maryland has the fifth-largest proportions of racial minorities in the country.\nIn 2006, 645,744 were counted as foreign born, which represents mainly people from Latin America and Asia. About four percent are undocumented immigrants.\nAccording to The Williams Institute's analysis of the 2010 U.S. census, 12,538 same-sex couples are living in Maryland, representing 5.8 same-sex couples per 1,000 households.\nRomani people are present in Maryland.\nReligion.\nMaryland has been historically prominent to American Catholic tradition because the English colony of Maryland was intended by George Calvert as a haven for English Catholics. Baltimore was the seat of the first Catholic bishop in the U.S. (1789), and Emmitsburg was the home and burial place of the first American-born citizen to be canonized, St. Elizabeth Ann Seton. Georgetown University, the first Catholic University, was founded in 1789 in what was then part of Maryland; it became a part of the District of Columbia when it was created in the 1790s. The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in Baltimore was the first Roman Catholic cathedral built in the United States, and the Archbishop of Baltimore is, albeit without formal primacy, the United States' quasi-primate, and often a cardinal. Among the immigrants of the 19th and 20th centuries from eastern and southern Europe were many Catholics.\nDespite its historic relevance to the Catholic Church in the United States, the percentage of Catholics in the state of Maryland is below the national average of 20%. Demographically, both Protestants and those identifying with no religion are more numerous than Catholics.\nAccording to the Pew Research Center in 2014, 69 percent of Maryland's population identifies themselves as Christian. Nearly 52% of the adult population are Protestants. Following Protestantism, Catholicism is the second largest religious affiliation, comprising 15% percent of the population. Amish/Mennonite communities are found in St. Mary's, Garrett, and Cecil counties. Judaism is the largest non-Christian religion in Maryland, with 241,000 adherents, or four percent of the total population. Jews are numerous throughout Montgomery County and in Pikesville and Owings Mills northwest of Baltimore. An estimated 81,500 Jewish Americans live in Montgomery County, constituting approximately 10% of the total population. The Seventh-day Adventist Church's world headquarters and Ahmadiyya Muslims' national headquarters are located in Silver Spring, just outside Washington, D.C.\nPer the Public Religion Research Institute in 2020, 61 percent of Maryland's population identified with Christianity. Protestantism and Roman Catholicism continued to dominate the Christian landscape, and the Jewish community remained at 3% of the total religious population. Of the unaffiliated, the PRRI study determined their increase to 28% of the population.\nLGBT population.\nMaryland has one of the highest percentages of LGBT people in its populace out of any state; 5.7% of Marylanders identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer, the highest of any state. (Washington, D.C. ranks higher with a LGBT population of 8.6%.) Maryland ranks as one of the best states in the nation for rights of the LGBT community, with protections against discrimination enacted since 2001 for sexuality and 2014 for gender, same-sex marriage legalization in 2013, bans on conversion therapy enacted in 2018, abolition of the gay panic defense in 2021, and issuance in 2023 of an executive order protecting the rights of transgender individuals. In 2020, Montgomery County unanimously passed an ordinance implementing an LGBTIQ+ bill of rights.\nThe first person known to describe himself as a drag queen was William Dorsey Swann, born enslaved in Hancock, Maryland. Swann was the first American on record who pursued legal and political action to defend the LGBTQ community's right to assemble.\nIn February 2010, Attorney General Doug Gansler issued an opinion stating that Maryland law should honor same-sex marriages from out of state. At the time, the state Supreme Court wrote a decision upholding marriage discrimination.\nOn March 1, 2012, Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley signed the freedom to marry bill into law after it passed in the state legislature. Opponents of same-sex marriage began collecting signatures to overturn the law, which faced a referendum, as Question 6, in the November 2012 election. A January 2011 Gonzales Research &amp; Marketing Strategies poll showed 51% support for marriage in the state.\nIn May 2012, Maryland's Court of Appeals ruled that the state will recognize marriages of same-sex couples who married out-of-state, no matter the outcome of the November election. Voters upheld the bill, passing Question 6 with 52% to 48% on November 6, 2012. Same-sex couples began marrying in Maryland on January 1, 2013.\nEconomy.\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that Maryland's gross state product in 2016 was $382.4billion. However, Maryland has been using Genuine Progress Indicator, an indicator of well-being, to guide the state's development, rather than relying only on growth indicators like GDP. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Maryland households are currently the wealthiest in the country, with a 2013 median household income of $72,483, which puts it ahead of New Jersey and Connecticut, which are second and third respectively. Two of Maryland's counties, Howard and Montgomery, are the second and eleventh wealthiest counties in the nation respectively. Maryland has the most millionaires per capita in 2013, with a ratio of 7.7 percent. Also, the state's poverty rate of 7.8 percent is the lowest in the country. Per capita personal income in 2006 was $43,500, fifth in the nation. As of March 2022, the state's unemployment rate was 4.6 percent.\nMaryland's economy benefits from the state's proximity to the federal government in Washington, D.C., with an emphasis on technical and administrative tasks for the defense/aerospace industry and bio-research laboratories, as well as staffing of satellite government headquarters in the suburban or exurban Baltimore/Washington area. Ft. Meade serves as the headquarters of the Defense Information Systems Agency, United States Cyber Command, and the National Security Agency/Central Security Service. In addition, a number of educational and medical research institutions are located in the state. The various components of The Johns Hopkins University and its medical research facilities are now the largest single employer in the Baltimore area.\nManufacturing, while large in dollar value, is highly diversified with no sub-sector contributing over 20 percent of the total. Typical forms of manufacturing include electronics, computer equipment, and chemicals. The once-mighty primary metals sub-sector, which once included what was then the largest steel factory in the world at Sparrows Point, still exists, but is pressed with foreign competition, bankruptcies, and mergers. During World War II, the Glenn Martin Company (now part of Lockheed Martin) airplane factory employed some 40,000 people.\nMining other than construction materials is virtually limited to coal, which is located in the mountainous western part of the state. The brownstone quarries in the east, which gave Baltimore and Washington much of their characteristic architecture in the mid-19th century, were once a predominant natural resource. Historically, there used to be small gold-mining operations in Maryland, some near Washington, but these no longer exist.\nIn 2022, the top private employers by number of employees were BYK Gardner, Clean Harbors, Holy Cross Hospital, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Maryland Neuroimaging Center, Northrop Grumman, University of Maryland, and University of Maryland Medical Center.\nPort of Baltimore.\nOne major service activity is transportation, centered on the Port of Baltimore and its related rail and trucking access. The port ranked 17th in the U.S. by tonnage in 2008. Although the port handles a wide variety of products, the most typical imports are raw materials and bulk commodities, such as iron ore, petroleum, sugar, and fertilizers, often distributed to the relatively close manufacturing centers of the inland Midwest via good overland transportation. The port also receives several brands of imported motor vehicles and is the number one auto port in the U.S.\nBaltimore City is among the top 15 largest ports in the nation, and was one of six major U.S. ports that were part of the February 2006 controversy over the Dubai Ports World deal. The state as a whole is heavily industrialized, with a prosperous economy and influential technology centers. Its computer industries are some of the most sophisticated in the United States, and the federal government has invested heavily in the area. Maryland is home to several large military bases and scores of high-level government jobs.\nThe Chesapeake and Delaware Canal is a canal on the Eastern Shore that connects the waters of the Delaware River with those of the Chesapeake Bay, and in particular with the Port of Baltimore, carrying 40 percent of the port's ship traffic.\nFishing.\nMaryland has a large food-production sector. A large component of this is commercial fishing, centered in the Chesapeake Bay, but also including activity off the short Atlantic seacoast. The largest catches by species are the blue crab, oysters, striped bass, and menhaden. The Bay also has overwintering waterfowl in its wildlife refuges. The waterfowl support a tourism sector of sportsmen.\nAgriculture.\nMaryland has large areas of fertile agricultural land in its coastal and Piedmont zones, though this land use is being encroached upon by urbanization. Agriculture is oriented to dairy farming (especially in foothill and piedmont areas) for nearby large city milksheads, plus specialty perishable horticulture crops, such as cucumbers, watermelons, sweet corn, tomatoes, melons, squash, and peas (Source:USDA Crop Profiles). The southern counties of the western shoreline of Chesapeake Bay are warm enough to support a tobacco cash crop zone, which has existed since early Colonial times, but declined greatly after a state government buy-out in the 1990s. There is also a large automated chicken-farming sector in the state's southeastern part; Salisbury is home to Perdue Farms. Maryland's food-processing plants are the most significant type of manufacturing by value in the state. Farming suffers from weeds as anywhere else, including an unusual multiply resistant ragweed (\"Ambrosia artemisiifolia\") found by Rousonelos \"et al.\", 2012 with both ALS- and PPO-resistances and which by 2016 had developed a third, EPSP resistance. This ragweed population is a drag on soybean cultivation and, as of \u00a0, 2022[ [update]], is the worst multiresistant weed problem in the state.\nBiotechnology.\nMaryland is a major center for life sciences research and development. With more than 400 biotechnology companies located there, Maryland is the fourth largest nexus in this field in the United States.\nInstitutions and government agencies with an interest in research and development located in Maryland include the Johns Hopkins University, the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, more than one campus of the University System of Maryland, Goddard Space Flight Center, the United States Census Bureau, the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Institute of Mental Health, the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the federal Food and Drug Administration, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Celera Genomics company, the J. Craig Venter Institute, and AstraZeneca (formerly MedImmune).\nMaryland is home to defense contractor Emergent BioSolutions, which manufactures and provides an anthrax vaccine to U.S. government military personnel.\nTourism.\nTourism is popular in Maryland. Many tourists visit Baltimore, the beaches of the Eastern Shore, and the nature of western Maryland. Attractions in Baltimore include the Harborplace, the Baltimore Aquarium, Fort McHenry, as well as the Camden Yards baseball stadium. Ocean City on the Atlantic Coast has been a popular beach destination in summer, particularly since the Chesapeake Bay Bridge was built in 1952 connecting the Eastern Shore to the more populated Maryland cities. The state capital of Annapolis offers sites such as the state capitol building, the historic district, and the waterfront. Maryland also has several sites of interest to military history, given Maryland's role in the American Civil War and in the War of 1812. Other attractions include the historic and picturesque towns along the Chesapeake Bay, such as Saint Mary's, Maryland's first colonial settlement and original capital.\nHealthcare.\nAs of 2017, the top two health insurers including all types of insurance were CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield with 47% market share followed by UnitedHealth Group at 15%.\nMaryland has experimented with healthcare payment reforms, notably beginning in the 1970s with an all-payer rate setting program regulated by the Health Services Cost Review Commission. In 2014, it switched to a global budget revenue system, whereby hospitals receive a capitated payment to care for their population.\nTransportation.\nThe Maryland Department of Transportation oversees most transportation in the state through its various administration-level agencies. The independent Maryland Transportation Authority maintains and operates the state's eight toll facilities.\nRoads.\nMaryland's Interstate highways include of I-95, which enters the northeast portion of the state, travels through Baltimore, and becomes part of the eastern section of the Capital Beltway to the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. I-68 travels , connecting the western portions of the state to I-70 in the small town of Hancock. I-70 enters from Pennsylvania north of Hancock and continues east for to Baltimore, connecting Hagerstown and Frederick along the way.\nI-83 has in Maryland and connects Baltimore to southern central Pennsylvania (Harrisburg and York, Pennsylvania). Maryland also has an portion of I-81 that travels through the state near Hagerstown. I-97, fully contained within Anne Arundel County and the shortest () one- or two-digit interstate highway in the contiguous US, connects the Baltimore area to the Annapolis area.\nThere are also several auxiliary Interstate highways in Maryland. Among them are two beltways encircling the major cities of the region: I-695, the McKeldin (Baltimore) Beltway, which encircles Baltimore; and a portion of I-495, the Capital Beltway, which encircles Washington, D.C. I-270, which connects the Frederick area with Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. through major suburbs to the northwest of Washington, is a major commuter route and is as wide as fourteen lanes at points. I-895, also known as the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel Thruway, provides an alternate route to I-95 across Baltimore Harbor.\nBoth I-270 and the Capital Beltway were extremely congested; however, the Intercounty Connector has alleviated some congestion over time. Construction of the ICC was a major part of the campaign platform of former Governor Robert Ehrlich, who was in office from 2003 until 2007, and of Governor Martin O'Malley, who succeeded him. I-595, which is an unsigned highway concurrent with US50/US301, is the longest unsigned interstate in the country and connects Prince George's County and Washington, D.C. with Annapolis and the Eastern Shore via the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.\nMaryland also has a state highway system that contains routes numbered from 2through 999, however most of the higher-numbered routes are either unsigned or are relatively short. Major state highways include Routes 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway/Solomons Island Road/Southern Maryland Blvd.), 4 (Pennsylvania Avenue/Southern Maryland Blvd./Patuxent Beach Road/St. Andrew's Church Road), 5 (Branch Avenue/Leonardtown Road/Point Lookout Road), 32, 45 (York Road), 97 (Georgia Avenue), 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway), 210 (Indian Head Highway), 235 (Three Notch Road), 295 (Baltimore-Washington Parkway), 355 (Wisconsin Avenue/Rockville Pike/Frederick Road), 404 (Queen Anne Highway/ Shore Highway), and 650 (New Hampshire Avenue).\nAirports.\nMaryland's largest airport is Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, more commonly referred to as BWI. The airport is named for the Baltimore-born Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Supreme Court justice. The only other airports with commercial service are at Hagerstown and Salisbury.\nThe Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. are also served by the other two airports in the region, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Dulles International Airport, both in Northern Virginia. The College Park Airport is the nation's oldest, founded in 1909, and is still used. Wilbur Wright trained military aviators at this location.\nRail.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Routemap/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAmtrak trains, including the high-speed Acela Express serve Penn Station in Baltimore, BWI Airport, New Carrollton, and Aberdeen along the Washington, D.C. to Boston Northeast Corridor. Train service is provided to Rockville and Cumberland by Amtrak's Washington, D.C., to Chicago Capitol Limited.\nThe WMATA's Metrorail rapid transit and Metrobus local bus systems (the 2nd and 6th busiest in the nation of their respective modes) provide service in Montgomery and Prince George's counties and connect them to Washington D.C.. The Maryland Transit Administration (often abbreviated as \"MTA Maryland\"), a state agency part of the Maryland Department of Transportation also provides transit services within the state. Headquartered in Baltimore, MTA's transit services are largely focused on central Maryland, as well as some portions of the Eastern Shore and Southern MD. Baltimore's Light RailLink and Metro SubwayLink systems serve its densely populated inner-city and the surrounding suburbs. The MTA also serves the city and its suburbs with its local bus service (the 9th largest system in the nation). The MTA's Commuter Bus system provides express coach service on longer routes connecting Washington, D.C. and Baltimore to parts of Central and Southern MD as well as the Eastern Shore. The commuter rail service, known as MARC, operates three lines which all terminate at Washington Union Station and provide service to Baltimore's Penn and Camden stations, Perryville, Frederick, and Martinsburg, West Virginia. In addition, many suburban counties operate local bus systems which connect to and complement the larger MTA and WMATA/Metro services.\nThe MTA will also administer the Purple Line, an under-construction light rail line that will connect the Maryland branches of the Red, Green/Yellow, and Orange lines of the Washington Metro, as well as offer transfers to all three lines of the MARC commuter rail system.\nFreight rail transport is handled principally by two Class I railroads, as well as several smaller regional and local carriers. CSX Transportation has more extensive trackage throughout the state, with , followed by Norfolk Southern Railway. Major rail yards are located in Baltimore and Cumberland, with an intermodal terminal (rail, truck and marine) in Baltimore.\nLaw and government.\nThe government of Maryland is conducted according to the state constitution. The government of Maryland, like the other 49 state governments, has exclusive authority over matters that lie entirely within the state's borders, except as limited by the Constitution of the United States.\nPower in Maryland is divided among three branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. The Maryland General Assembly is composed of the Maryland House of Delegates and the Maryland Senate. Maryland's governor is unique in the United States as the office is vested with significant authority in budgeting. Unlike many other states, significant autonomy is granted to many of Maryland's counties.\nMost of the business of government is conducted in Annapolis, the state capital; however some cabinet departments and state officials have their offices in Baltimore. Elections for governor and most statewide offices, as well as most county elections, are held in midterm-election years (even-numbered years not divisible by four).\nThe judicial branch of state government consists of one united District Court of Maryland that sits in every county and Baltimore City, as well as 24 Circuit Courts sitting in each County and Baltimore City, the latter being courts of general jurisdiction for all civil disputes over $30,000, all equitable jurisdiction and major criminal proceedings. The intermediate appellate court is known as the Appellate Court of Maryland and the state supreme court is the Supreme Court of Maryland. The appearance of the justices of the Supreme Court of Maryland is unique; Maryland is the only state whose justices wear red robes.\nTaxation.\nMaryland imposes five income tax brackets, ranging from 2to 6.25 percent of personal income. The city of Baltimore and Maryland's 23 counties levy local \"piggyback\" income taxes at rates between 1.25 and 3.2 percent of Maryland taxable income. Local officials set the rates and the revenue is returned to the local governments quarterly. The top income tax bracket of 9.45 percent is the fifth highest combined state and local income tax rates in the country, behind New York City's 11.35 percent, California's 10.3 percent, Rhode Island's 9.9 percent, and Vermont's 9.5 percent.\nMaryland's state sales tax is six percent. All real property in Maryland is subject to the property tax. Generally, properties that are owned and used by religious, charitable, or educational organizations or property owned by the federal, state or local governments are exempt. Property tax rates vary widely. No restrictions or limitations on property taxes are imposed by the state, meaning cities and counties can set tax rates at the level they deem necessary to fund governmental services.\nElections.\nFollowing the American Civil War, Maryland's elections have largely been controlled by the Democratic Party, which accounted for 54.9% of the state's registered voters as of May 2017.\nState elections are dominated by Baltimore and four populous suburban counties bordering Washington, D.C., and Baltimore: Montgomery, Prince George's, Anne Arundel, and Baltimore counties. As of July 2017, 66 percent of the state's population resides in these six jurisdictions, most of which contain large, traditionally Democratic voting blocs: African Americans in Baltimore City and Prince George's; federal employees in Prince George's, Anne Arundel, and Montgomery; and post-graduates in Montgomery. The remainder of the state, particularly Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore, is more supportive of Republicans. One of Maryland's best known political figures is a Republican \u2013 former governor Spiro Agnew, who pled no contest to tax evasion and resigned in 1973.\nIn 1980, Maryland was one of six states to vote for Jimmy Carter. In 1992, Bill Clinton fared better in Maryland than any other state, except his home state of Arkansas. In 1996, Maryland was Clinton's sixth best; in 2000, Maryland ranked fourth for Gore; and in 2004, John Kerry showed his fifth-best performance in Maryland. In 2008, Barack Obama won the state's 10 electoral votes with 61.9 percent of the vote, to John McCain's 36.5 percent.\nIn 2002, former Governor Robert Ehrlich was the first Republican to be elected to that office in four decades, and after one term, he lost his seat to Baltimore Mayor and Democrat Martin O'Malley. Ehrlich ran again for governor in 2010, losing again to O'Malley.\nThe 2006 election brought no change in the pattern of Democratic dominance. After Democratic Senator Paul Sarbanes announced that he was retiring, Democratic Congressman Benjamin Cardin defeated Republican Lieutenant Governor Michael S. Steele, with 55 percent of the vote, against Steele's 44 percent.\nWhile Republicans typically win more counties in statewide elections by piling up large margins in the west and east, they are usually overcome by the densely populated and solidly Democratic Baltimore\u2013Washington axis. In 2008, for instance, McCain won 17 counties to Obama's six (plus Baltimore City). While McCain won most of the western and eastern counties by margins of 2-to-1 or more, he was almost completely shut out in the larger counties surrounding Baltimore and Washington; every large county except Anne Arundel went for Obama, who won by 25 points statewide.\nFrom 2007 to 2011, U.S. Congressman Steny Hoyer (MD-5), a Democrat, was elected as Majority Leader for the 110th Congress and 111th Congress of the House of Representatives, serving in that post again from 2019 to 2023. In addition, Hoyer served as House Minority Whip from 2003 to 2006 and 2012 to 2018. His district covers parts of Anne Arundel and Prince George's counties, in addition to all of Charles, Calvert, and St. Mary's counties in southern Maryland.\nIn 2010, Republicans won control of most counties. The Democratic Party remained in control of eight county governments, including that of Baltimore.\nIn 2022, Wes Moore replaced Republican Larry Hogan, who did not run for re-election due to term limits. Moore is the first African-American elected Governor of Maryland, and the fifth African-American governor in American history.\nMedia.\nA well-known newspaper in Maryland is \"The Baltimore Sun\".\nMany residents of the Washington metropolitan area receive \"The Washington Post.\"\nThe most populous areas are served by either Baltimore or Washington, D.C. broadcast stations. The Eastern Shore is served primarily by broadcast media based around the Delmarva Peninsula; the northeastern section receives both Baltimore and Philadelphia stations. Garrett County, which is mountainous, is served by stations from Pittsburgh, and requires cable or satellite for reception. Maryland is served by statewide PBS member station Maryland Public Television (MPT).\nEducation.\nPrimary and secondary education.\n\"Education Week\" ranked Maryland #1 in its nationwide 2009\u20132013 Quality Counts reports. Primary and secondary education in Maryland is overseen by the Maryland State Department of Education, which is headquartered in Baltimore. The highest educational official in the state is the State Superintendent of Schools, who is appointed by the State Board of Education to a four-year term of office. The Maryland General Assembly has given the Superintendent and State Board autonomy to make educationally related decisions, limiting its influence on the day-to-day functions of public education. Each county and county-equivalent in Maryland has a local Board of Education charged with running the public schools in that particular jurisdiction.\nThe budget for education was $5.5billion in 2009, representing about 40 percent of the state's general fund. Data from the 2017 census shows that, among large school districts, four Maryland districts are in the top six for per-pupil annual spending, exceeded only by the Boston and New York City districts.\nMaryland has a broad range of private primary and secondary schools. Many of these are affiliated with various religious sects, including parochial schools of the Catholic Church, Quaker schools, Seventh-day Adventist schools, and Jewish schools. In 2003, Maryland law was changed to allow for the creation of publicly funded charter schools, although the charter schools must be approved by their local Board of Education and are not exempt from state laws on education, including collective bargaining laws.\nIn 2008, the state led the entire country in the percentage of students passing Advanced Placement examinations. 23.4 percent of students earned passing grades on the AP tests given in May 2008. This marks the first year that Maryland earned this honor. Three Maryland high schools (in Montgomery County) were ranked among the top 100 in the country by US News in 2009, based in large part on AP test scores.\nColleges and universities.\nMaryland has several historic and renowned private colleges and universities, the most prominent of which is Johns Hopkins University, founded in 1876 with a grant from Baltimore entrepreneur Johns Hopkins.\nThe first public university in the state is the University of Maryland, Baltimore, which was founded in 1807 and contains the University of Maryland's only public academic health, human services, and one of two law centers (the other being the University of Baltimore School of Law). Seven professional and graduate schools train the majority of the state's physicians, nurses, dentists, lawyers, social workers, and pharmacists. The flagship university and largest undergraduate institution in Maryland is the University of Maryland, College Park which was founded as the Maryland Agricultural College in 1856 and became a public land grant college in 1864. Towson University, founded in 1866, is the state's second largest university.\nIn 1974, Maryland, along with seven other states, mainly in the South, submitted plans to desegregate its state universities; Maryland's plans were approved by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare.\nBaltimore is home to the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and the Maryland Institute College of Art. The majority of public universities in the state (Bowie State University, Coppin State University, Frostburg State University, Salisbury University and the University of Maryland-Eastern Shore) are affiliated with the University System of Maryland. Two state-funded institutions, Morgan State University and St. Mary's College of Maryland, as well as two federally funded institutions, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and the United States Naval Academy, are not affiliated with the University System of Maryland. The University of Maryland Global Campus is the largest public university in Maryland and one of the largest distance-learning institutions in the world.\nSt. John's College in Annapolis and Washington College in Chestertown, both private institutions, are the oldest colleges in the state and among the oldest in the country. Other private institutions include Mount St. Mary's University, McDaniel College (formerly known as Western Maryland College), Hood College, Stevenson University (formerly known as Villa Julie College), Loyola University Maryland, and Goucher College, among others.\nEducation assessments and impact.\nThere are several state-level assessments which are used to characterize schools and changes in their educational efficacy. The annual Maryland School Report Card which scores districts and individual schools based on graduation rates, attendance information and academic achievement among other factors. The Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program (MCAP) is an assessment of individual students in English and math, beginning in the 3rd grade. As of 2027, the MCAP will begin to be used to determine whether 3rd grade students would need to repeat the grade level or could proceed to the 4th grade.\nPublic libraries.\nMaryland's 24 public library systems deliver public education for everyone in the state of Maryland through a curriculum that comprises three pillars: Self-Directed Education (books and materials in all formats, e-resources), Research Assistance &amp; Instruction (individualized research assistance, classes for students of all ages), and Instructive &amp; Enlightening Experiences (e.g., Summer Reading Clubs, author events).\nMaryland's library systems include, in part:\nMany of the library systems have established formalized partnerships with other educational institutions in their counties and regions.\nSports.\nWith two major metropolitan areas, Maryland has a number of major and minor professional sports franchises. Two National Football League teams play in Maryland, the Baltimore Ravens in Baltimore and the Washington Commanders in Landover. The Baltimore Colts represented the NFL in Baltimore from 1953 to 1983 before moving to Indianapolis.\nThe Baltimore Orioles are the state's Major League Baseball franchise. The National Hockey League's Washington Capitals and the National Basketball Association's Washington Wizards formerly played in Maryland, until the construction of an arena in Washington, D.C. in 1997 (now known as Capital One Arena). University of Maryland's team is the Maryland Terrapins.\nMaryland enjoys considerable historical repute for the talented sports players of its past, including Cal Ripken Jr. and Babe Ruth. In 2012, \"The Baltimore Sun\" published a list of Maryland's top ten athletes in the state's history. The list includes Babe Ruth, Cal Ripken Jr, Johnny Unitas, Brooks Robinson, Frank Robinson, Ray Lewis, Michael Phelps, Jimmie Foxx, Jim Parker, and Wes Unseld.\nOther professional sports franchises in the state include three affiliated minor league baseball teams, one independent league baseball team, the Baltimore Blast indoor soccer team, two indoor football teams and three low-level outdoor soccer teams. Maryland is also home to one of the three races in horse racing's annual Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes, which is run every spring at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. The Baltimore Stallions were a Canadian Football Team in the CFL that played the 1994\u201395 season.\nCongressional Country Club has hosted three golf tournaments for the U.S. Open and a PGA Championship.\nThe official state sport of Maryland, since 1962, is jousting; the official team sport since 2004 is lacrosse. The National Lacrosse Hall of Fame is located in Sparks, Maryland at the USA Lacrosse headquarters. In 2008, intending to promote physical fitness for all ages, walking became the official state exercise. Maryland is the first state with an official state exercise.\nFriendship partners.\nMaryland has relationships with many provinces, states, and other administrative divisions worldwide.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18859", "revid": "488581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18859", "title": "Michigan", "text": "U.S. state\nMichigan ( ) is a peninsular state in the Great Lakes region of the Upper Midwestern United States. It shares water and land boundaries with Minnesota to the northwest, Wisconsin to the west, Indiana and Illinois to the southwest, Ohio to the southeast, and the Canadian province of Ontario to the east, northeast and north. With a population of 10.14 million and an area of , Michigan is the tenth-largest state by population, the 11th-largest by area, and the largest by total area east of the Mississippi River. The state capital is Lansing, while its most populous city is Detroit. The Metro Detroit region in Southeast Michigan is among the nation's most populous and largest metropolitan economies. Other important metropolitan areas include Grand Rapids, Flint, Ann Arbor, Kalamazoo, the Tri-Cities, and Muskegon.\nMichigan consists of two peninsulas: the heavily forested Upper Peninsula (commonly called \"the U.P.\"), which juts eastward from northern Wisconsin, and the more populated Lower Peninsula, stretching north from Ohio and Indiana. The peninsulas are separated by the Straits of Mackinac, which connects Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, and are linked by the 5-mile-long Mackinac Bridge along Interstate 75. Bordering four of the five Great Lakes and Lake St. Clair, Michigan has the longest freshwater coastline of any U.S. political subdivision, measuring 3,288 miles. The state ranks second behind Alaska in water coverage by square miles and first in percentage, with approximately 42%, and it also contains 64,980 inland lakes and ponds.\nThe Great Lakes region has largely been inhabited for thousands of years by Indigenous peoples such as the Ojibwe, Odawa, Potawatomi, and Wyandot.\nSome people contend that the region's name is derived from the Ojibwe word \u14a5\u14ef\u1472\u14a5 (mishigami), meaning \"large water\" or \"large lake\". While others say that it comes from the Mishiiken Tribe of Mackinac Island, also called Michinemackinawgo by Ottawa historian Andrew Blackbird, whose surrounding lands were referred to as Mishiiken-imakinakom, later shortened to Michilimackinac.\nIn the 17th century, French explorers claimed the area for New France. French settlers and M\u00e9tis established forts and settlements.\nAfter France's defeat in the French and Indian War in 1762, the area came under British control and later the U.S. following the Treaty of Paris (1783), though control remained disputed with Indigenous tribes until treaties between 1795 and 1842. The area was part of the larger Northwest Territory; the Michigan Territory was organized in 1805.\nMichigan was admitted as the 26th state on January 26, 1837, entering as a free state and quickly developing into an industrial and trade hub that attracted European immigrants, particularly from Finland, Macedonia, and the Netherlands.\nIn the 1930s, migration from Appalachia and the Middle East and the Great Migration of Black Southerners further shaped the state, especially in Metro Detroit.\nMichigan has a diversified economy with a gross state product of $725.897billion as of Q1 2025, ranking 14th among the 50 states. Although the state has developed a diverse economy, in the early 20th century it became widely known as the center of the U.S. automotive industry, which developed as a major national economic force. It is home to the country's three major automobile companies (whose headquarters are all in Metro Detroit). Once exploited for logging and mining, today the sparsely populated Upper Peninsula is important for tourism because of its abundance of natural resources. The Lower Peninsula is a center of manufacturing, forestry, agriculture, services, and high-tech industry.\nHistory.\nWhen the first European explorers arrived, the most populous tribes were the Algonquian peoples, which include the Anishinaabe groups of Ojibwe, Odaawaa/Odawa (Ottawa), and the Boodewaadamii/Bod\u00e9wadmi (Potawatomi). The three nations coexisted peacefully as part of a loose confederation called the Council of Three Fires. The Ojibwe, whose numbers are estimated to have been at least 35,000, were the largest.\nThe Ojibwe Indians (also known as Chippewa in the U.S.), an Anishinaabe tribe, were established in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and northern and central Michigan. Bands also inhabited Ontario and southern Manitoba, Canada; and northern Wisconsin, and northern and north-central Minnesota. Smaller groups of Algonquian Indians like the Noquet in the Upper Peninsula were present for thousands of years but subsequently absorbed by neighboring tribes before and during European contact. The Ottawa Indians lived primarily south of the Straits of Mackinac in northern, western, and southern Michigan, but also in southern Ontario, northern Ohio, and eastern Wisconsin. The Potawatomi were in southern and western Michigan, in addition to northern and central Indiana, northern Illinois, southern Wisconsin, and southern Ontario. Other Algonquian tribes in Michigan, in the south and east, were the Mascouten, the Menominee, the Miami, the Sac (or Sauk), and the Meskwaki (Fox). The Wyandot were an Iroquoian-speaking people in this area; they were historically known as the Huron by the French, and were the historical adversaries of the Iroquois Confederation.\n17th century.\nFrench \"voyageurs\" and \"coureurs des bois\" explored and settled in Michigan in the 17th century. The first Europeans to reach what became Michigan were those of \u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9's expedition in 1622. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1668 on the site where P\u00e8re Jacques Marquette established Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, as a base for Catholic missions. Missionaries in 1671\u201375 founded outlying stations at Saint Ignace and Marquette. Jesuit missionaries were well received by the area's Indian populations, with few difficulties or hostilities. In 1679, Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle built Fort Miami at present-day St. Joseph. In 1691, the French established a trading post and Fort St. Joseph along the St. Joseph River at the present-day city of Niles.\n18th century.\nIn 1701, French explorer and army officer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac founded Fort Pontchartrain du D\u00e9troit or \"Fort Pontchartrain on-the-Strait\" on the strait, known as the Detroit River, between lakes Saint Clair and Erie. Cadillac had convinced Louis XIV's chief minister, Louis Ph\u00e9lypeaux, Comte de Pontchartrain, that a permanent community there would strengthen French control over the upper Great Lakes and discourage British aspirations.\nThe hundred soldiers and workers who accompanied Cadillac built a fort enclosing one arpent (about , the equivalent of just under per side) and named it Fort Pontchartrain. Cadillac's wife, Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Guyon, soon moved to Detroit, becoming one of the first European women to settle in what was considered the wilderness of Michigan. The town quickly became a major fur-trading and shipping post. The \"\u00c9glise de Saint-Anne\" (Catholic Church of Saint Anne) was founded the same year. While the original building does not survive, the congregation remains active. Cadillac later departed to serve as the French governor of Louisiana from 1710 to 1716. French attempts to consolidate the fur trade led to the Fox Wars, in which the Meskwaki (Fox) and their allies fought the French and their Native allies.\nAt the same time, the French strengthened Fort Michilimackinac at the Straits of Mackinac to better control their lucrative fur-trading empire. By the mid-18th century, the French also occupied forts at present-day Niles and Sault Ste. Marie, though most of the rest of the region remained unsettled by Europeans. France offered free land to attract families to Detroit, which grew to 800 people in 1765. It was the largest city between Montreal and New Orleans. French settlers also established small farms south of the Detroit River opposite the fort, near a Jesuit mission and Huron village.\nFrom 1660 until the end of French rule, Michigan was part of the Royal Province of New France. In 1760, Montreal fell to the British forces, ending the French and Indian War (1754\u20131763), the North American front of the Seven Years' War in Europe. Under the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Michigan and the rest of New France east of the Mississippi River were ceded by defeated France to Great Britain. After the Quebec Act was passed in 1774, Michigan became part of the British Province of Quebec. By 1778, Detroit's population reached 2,144 and it was the third-largest city in Quebec province.\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Detroit was an important British supply center. Most of the inhabitants were French-Canadians or American Indians, many of whom had been allied with the French because of long trading ties. Because of imprecise cartography and unclear language defining the boundaries in the 1783 Treaty of Paris, the British retained control of Detroit and Michigan after the American Revolution. When Quebec split into Lower and Upper Canada in 1791, Michigan was part of Kent County, Upper Canada. It held its first democratic elections in August 1792 to send delegates to the new provincial parliament at Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake).\nUnder terms negotiated in the 1794 Jay Treaty, Britain withdrew from Detroit and Michilimackinac in 1796. It retained control of territory east and south of the Detroit River, which are now included in Ontario, Canada. Questions remained over the boundary for many years, and the United States did not have uncontested control of the Upper Peninsula and Drummond Island until 1818 and 1847, respectively.\n19th century.\nDuring the War of 1812, the United States forces at Fort Detroit surrendered Michigan Territory (effectively consisting of Detroit and the surrounding area) after a nearly bloodless siege in 1812. A U.S. attempt to retake Detroit resulted in a severe American defeat in the River Raisin Massacre. This battle, still ranked as the bloodiest ever fought in the state, had the highest number of American casualties of any battle of the war.\nMichigan was recaptured by the Americans in 1813 after the Battle of Lake Erie. They used Michigan as a base to launch an invasion of Canada, which culminated in the Battle of the Thames. But the more northern areas of Michigan were held by the British until the peace treaty restored the old boundaries. A number of forts, including Fort Wayne, were built by the United States in Michigan during the 19th century out of fears of renewed fighting with Britain.\nMichigan Territory governor and judges established the University of Michigan in 1817, as the Catholepistemiad, or the University of Michigania.\nThe population grew slowly until the opening in 1825 of the Erie Canal through the Mohawk Valley in New York, connecting the Great Lakes to the Hudson River and New York City. The new route attracted a large influx of settlers to the Michigan territory. They worked as farmers, lumbermen, shipbuilders, and merchants and shipped out grain, lumber, and iron ore. By the 1830s, Michigan had 30,000 residents, more than enough to apply and qualify for statehood.\nOn November 1, 1935, the U.S. Post Office issued a commemorative 3-cent stamp celebrating the 100th anniversary of Michigan statehood. Michigan's statehood, however, wasn't officially established until January 26, 1837, but since the campaign for statehood actually began in 1835, Michigan chose to hold its centennial celebration in 1935, the year the stamp was first issued.\nA constitutional convention of assent was held to lead the territory to statehood. In October 1835 the people approved the constitution of 1835, thereby forming a state government. Congressional recognition was delayed pending resolution of a boundary dispute with Ohio known as the Toledo War. Congress awarded the \"Toledo Strip\" to Ohio. Michigan received the western part of the Upper Peninsula as a concession and formally entered the Union as a free state on January 26, 1837. The Upper Peninsula proved to be a rich source of lumber, iron, and copper. Michigan led the nation in lumber production from the 1850s to the 1880s. Railroads became a major engine of growth from the 1850s onward, with Detroit the chief hub.\nA second wave of French-Canadian immigrants settled in Michigan during the late 19th to early 20th century, working in lumbering areas in counties on the Lake Huron side of the Lower Peninsula, such as the Saginaw Valley, Alpena, and Cheboygan counties, as well as throughout the Upper Peninsula, with large concentrations in Escanaba and the Keweenaw Peninsula.\nThe first statewide meeting of the Republican Party took place on July 6, 1854, in Jackson, Michigan, where the party adopted its platform. The state was predominantly Republican until the 1930s, reflecting the political continuity of migrants from across the Northern Tier of New England and New York. Michigan made a significant contribution to the Union in the American Civil War and sent more than forty regiments of volunteers to the federal armies.\nMichigan modernized and expanded its system of education in this period. The Michigan State Normal School, now Eastern Michigan University, was founded in 1849, for the training of teachers. It was the fourth oldest normal school in the United States and the first U.S. normal school outside New England. In 1899, the Michigan State Normal School became the first normal school in the nation to offer a four-year curriculum. Michigan Agricultural College (1855), now Michigan State University in East Lansing, was founded as the first agricultural college in the nation. Many private colleges were founded as well, and the smaller cities established high schools late in the century.\n20th\u201321st centuries.\nMichigan's economy underwent a transformation at the turn of the 20th century. Many individuals, including Ransom E. Olds, John and Horace Dodge, Henry Leland, David Dunbar Buick, Henry Joy, Charles King, and Henry Ford, provided the concentration of engineering know-how and technological enthusiasm to develop the automotive industry. Ford's development of the moving assembly line in Highland Park marked a new era in transportation. Like the steamship and railroad, mass production of automobiles was a far-reaching development. More than the forms of public transportation, the affordable automobile transformed private life. Automobile production became the major industry of Detroit and Michigan, and permanently altered the socioeconomic life of the United States and much of the world.\nWith the growth, the auto industry created jobs in Detroit that attracted immigrants from Europe and migrants from across the United States, including both blacks and whites from the rural South. By 1920, Detroit was the fourth-largest city in the U.S.. Residential housing was in short supply, and it took years for the market to catch up with the population boom. By the 1930s, so many immigrants had arrived that more than 30 languages were spoken in the public schools, and ethnic communities celebrated in annual heritage festivals. Over the years immigrants and migrants contributed greatly to Detroit's diverse urban culture, including popular music trends. The influential Motown Sound of the 1960s was led by a variety of individual singers and groups.\nGrand Rapids, the second-largest city in Michigan, also became an important center of manufacturing. Since 1838, the city has been noted for its furniture industry. In the 21st century, it is home to five of the world's leading office furniture companies. Grand Rapids is home to a number of major companies including Steelcase, Amway, and Meijer. Grand Rapids is also an important center for GE Aviation Systems.\nMichigan held its first United States presidential primary election in 1910. With its rapid growth in industry, it was an important center of industry-wide union organizing, such as the rise of the United Auto Workers.\nIn 1920 WWJ (AM) in Detroit became the first radio station in the United States to regularly broadcast commercial programs. Throughout that decade, some of the country's largest and most ornate skyscrapers were built in the city. Particularly noteworthy are the Fisher Building, Cadillac Place, and the Guardian Building, each of which has been designated as a National Historic Landmark (NHL).\nIn 1927 a school bombing took place in Clinton County. The Bath School disaster resulted in the deaths of 38 schoolchildren and constitutes the deadliest mass murder in a school in U.S. history.\nMichigan converted much of its manufacturing to satisfy defense needs during World War II; it manufactured 10.9% of the United States military armaments produced during the war, ranking second (behind New York) among the 48 states.\nDetroit continued to expand through the 1950s, at one point doubling its population in a decade. After World War II, housing was developed in suburban areas outside city cores to meet demand for residences. The federal government subsidized the construction of interstate highways, which were intended to strengthen military access, but also allowed commuters and business traffic to travel the region more easily. Since 1960, modern advances in the auto industry have led to increased automation, high-tech industry, and increased suburban growth. Longstanding tensions in Detroit culminated in the Twelfth Street riot in July 1967.\nDuring the late 1970s and the early 1980s, increasing fuel costs and other factors made significantly more global competition and recession among families. Michigan lost a significant amount of population due to global competition and the dramatic unavailability of manufacturing jobs. Meanwhile, Michigan had increased use of technology, specifically when the IBM Personal Computer started selling in the state, in which became mostly used at work.\nMichigan became the leading auto-producing state in the U.S., with the industry primarily located throughout the Midwestern United States; Ontario, Canada; and the Southern United States. With almost ten million residents in 2010, Michigan is a large and influential state, ranking tenth in population among the fifty states. Detroit is the centrally located metropolitan area of the Great Lakes megalopolis and the second-largest metropolitan area in the U.S. (after Chicago) linking the Great Lakes system.\nThe Metro Detroit area in Southeast Michigan is the state's largest metropolitan area (roughly 50% of the population resides there) and the eleventh largest in the United States. The Grand Rapids metropolitan area in Western Michigan is the state's fastest-growing metro area, with more than 1.3 million residents as of 2006[ [update]].\nGeography.\nMichigan consists of two peninsulas separated by the Straits of Mackinac. The 45th parallel north runs through the state, marked by highway signs and the Polar-Equator Trail\u2014 along a line including Mission Point Light near Traverse City, the towns of Gaylord and Alpena in the Lower Peninsula and Menominee in the Upper Peninsula. With the exception of two tiny areas drained by the Mississippi River by way of the Wisconsin River in the Upper Peninsula and by way of the Kankakee-Illinois River in the Lower Peninsula, Michigan is drained by the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence watershed and is the only state with the majority of its land thus drained. No point in the state is more than from a natural water source or more than from a Great Lakes shoreline.\nThe Great Lakes that border Michigan from east to west are Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake Michigan and Lake Superior. The state is bounded on the south by the states of Ohio and Indiana, sharing land and water boundaries with both. Michigan's western boundaries are almost entirely water boundaries, from south to north, with Illinois and Wisconsin in Lake Michigan; then a land boundary with Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula, that is principally demarcated by the Menominee and Montreal Rivers; then water boundaries again, in Lake Superior, with Wisconsin and Minnesota to the west, capped around by the Canadian province of Ontario to the north and east.\nThe heavily forested Upper Peninsula is relatively mountainous in the west. The Porcupine Mountains, which are part of one of the oldest mountain chains in the world, rise to an altitude of almost above sea level and form the watershed between the streams flowing into Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. The surface on either side of this range is rugged. The state's highest point, in the Huron Mountains northwest of Marquette, is Mount Arvon at . The peninsula is as large as Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island combined but has fewer than 330,000 inhabitants. The people are sometimes called \"Yoopers\" (from \"U.P.'ers\"), and their speech (the \"Yooper dialect\") has been heavily influenced by the numerous Scandinavian and Canadian immigrants who settled the area during the lumbering and mining boom of the late 19th century.\nThe Lower Peninsula is shaped like a mitten and many residents hold up a hand to depict where they are from. It is long from north to south and from east to west and occupies nearly two-thirds of the state's land area. The surface of the peninsula is generally level, broken by conical hills and glacial moraines usually not more than a few hundred feet tall. It is divided by a low water divide running north and south. The larger portion of the state is on the west of this and gradually slopes toward Lake Michigan. The highest point in the Lower Peninsula is either Briar Hill at , or one of several points nearby in the vicinity of Cadillac. The lowest point is the surface of Lake Erie at .\nThe geographic orientation of Michigan's peninsulas makes for a long distance between the ends of the state. Ironwood, in the far western Upper Peninsula, lies by highway from Lambertville in the Lower Peninsula's southeastern corner. The geographic isolation of the Upper Peninsula from Michigan's political and population centers makes the region culturally and economically distinct. Frequent attempts to establish the Upper Peninsula as its own state have failed to gain traction.\nA feature of Michigan that gives it the distinct shape of a mitten is the Thumb, which projects into Lake Huron, forming Saginaw Bay. Other notable peninsulas of Michigan include the Keweenaw Peninsula, which projects northeasterly into Lake Superior from the Upper Peninsula and largely comprising Michigan's Copper Country region, and the Leelanau Peninsula, projecting from the Lower Peninsula into Lake Michigan, forming Michigan's \"little finger\".\nNumerous lakes and marshes mark both peninsulas, and the coast is much indented. Keweenaw Bay, Whitefish Bay, and the Big and Little Bays De Noc are the principal indentations on the Upper Peninsula. The Grand and Little Traverse, Thunder, and Saginaw bays indent the Lower Peninsula. Michigan has the second longest shoreline of any state\u2014, including of island shoreline.\nThe state has numerous large islands, the principal ones being the North Manitou and South Manitou, Beaver, and Fox groups in Lake Michigan; Isle Royale and Grande Isle in Lake Superior; Marquette, Bois Blanc, and Mackinac islands in Lake Huron; and Neebish, Sugar, and Drummond islands in St. Mary's River. Michigan has about 150 lighthouses, the most of any U.S. state. The first lighthouses in Michigan were built between 1818 and 1822. They were built to project light at night and to serve as a landmark during the day to safely guide the passenger ships and freighters traveling the Great Lakes (see: lighthouses in the United States).\nThe state's rivers are generally small, short and shallow, and few are navigable. The principal ones include the Detroit River, St. Marys River, and St. Clair River which connect the Great Lakes; the Au Sable, Cheboygan, and Saginaw, which flow into Lake Huron; the Ontonagon, and Tahquamenon, which flow into Lake Superior; and the St. Joseph, Kalamazoo, Grand, Muskegon, Manistee, and Escanaba, which flow into Lake Michigan. The state has 11,037 inland lakes\u2014totaling of inland water\u2014in addition to of Great Lakes waters. No point in Michigan is more than from an inland lake or more than from one of the Great Lakes.\nThe state is home to several areas maintained by the National Park Service including: Isle Royale National Park, in Lake Superior, about southeast of Thunder Bay, Ontario. Other national protected areas in the state include: Keweenaw National Historical Park, Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, Huron National Forest, Manistee National Forest, Hiawatha National Forest, Ottawa National Forest and Father Marquette National Memorial. The largest section of the North Country National Scenic Trail passes through Michigan.\nWith 78 state parks, 19 state recreation areas, and six state forests, Michigan has the largest state park and state forest system of any state.\nClimate.\nMichigan has a continental climate with two distinct regions. The southern and central parts of the Lower Peninsula (south of Saginaw Bay and from the Grand Rapids area southward) have a warmer climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Dfa\") with hot summers and cold winters. The northern part of the Lower Peninsula and the entire Upper Peninsula has a more severe climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Dfb\"), with warm, but shorter summers and longer, cold to very cold winters. Some parts of the state average high temperatures below freezing from December through February, and into early March in the far northern parts. During the winter through the middle of February, the state is frequently subjected to heavy lake-effect snow. The state averages from of precipitation annually; however, some areas in the northern lower peninsula and the upper peninsula average almost of snowfall per year. Michigan's highest recorded temperature is at Mio on July 13, 1936, and the coldest recorded temperature is at Vanderbilt on February 9, 1934.\nThe state averages 30 days of thunderstorm activity per year. These can be severe, especially in the southern part of the state. The state averages 17 tornadoes per year, which are more common in the state's extreme southern section. Portions of the southern border have been almost as vulnerable historically as states further west and in Tornado Alley. For this reason, many communities in the very southern portions of the state have tornado sirens to warn residents of approaching tornadoes. Farther north, in Central Michigan, Northern Michigan, and the Upper Peninsula, tornadoes are rare.\nGeology.\nThe geological formation of the state is greatly varied, with the Michigan Basin being the most major formation. Primary boulders are found over the entire surface of the Upper Peninsula (being principally of primitive origin), while Secondary deposits cover the entire Lower Peninsula. The Upper Peninsula exhibits Lower Silurian sandstones, limestones, copper and iron bearing rocks, corresponding to the Huronian system of Canada. The central portion of the Lower Peninsula contains coal measures and rocks of the Pennsylvanian period. Devonian and sub-Carboniferous deposits are scattered over the entire state.\nMichigan rarely experiences earthquakes, and those that it does experience are generally smaller ones that do not cause significant damage. A 4.6-magnitude earthquake struck in August 1947. More recently, a 4.2-magnitude earthquake occurred on Saturday, May 2, 2015, shortly after noon, about five miles south of Galesburg, Michigan (9 miles southeast of Kalamazoo) in central Michigan, about 140 miles west of Detroit, according to the Colorado-based U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center. No major damage or injuries were reported, according to then-Governor Rick Snyder's office.\nAdministrative divisions.\nState government is decentralized among three tiers\u2014statewide, county and township. Counties are administrative divisions of the state, and townships are administrative divisions of a county. Both of them exercise state government authority, localized to meet the particular needs of their jurisdictions, as provided by state law. There are 83 counties in Michigan.\nCities, state universities, and villages are vested with home rule powers of varying degrees. Home rule cities can generally do anything not prohibited by law. The fifteen state universities have broad power and can do anything within the parameters of their status as educational institutions that is not prohibited by the state constitution. Villages, by contrast, have limited home rule and are not completely autonomous from the county and township in which they are located.\nThere are two types of township in Michigan: \"general law\" township and \"charter\". Charter township status was created by the Legislature in 1947 and grants additional powers and stream-lined administration in order to provide greater protection against annexation by a city. As of April\u00a02001[ [update]], there were 127 charter townships in Michigan. In general, charter townships have many of the same powers as a city but without the same level of obligations. For example, a charter township can have its own fire department, water and sewer department, police department, and so on\u2014just like a city\u2014but it is not \"required\" to have those things, whereas cities \"must\" provide those services. Charter townships can opt to use county-wide services instead, such as deputies from the county sheriff's office instead of a home-based force of ordinance officers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSince 1800 U.S. census, Michigan has experienced relatively positive and stable population growth trends; beginning with a population of 3,757, the 2010 census recorded 9,883,635 residents. At the 2020 United States census, its population was 10,077,331, an increase of 2.03% since 2010's tabulation. According to the United States Census Bureau, it is the third-most populous state in the Midwest and its East North Central subregion, behind Ohio and Illinois.\nThe center of population of Michigan is in Shiawassee County, in the southeastern corner of the civil township of Bennington, which is northwest of the village of Morrice.\nAccording to the American Immigration Council in 2019, an estimated 6.8% of Michiganders were immigrants, while 3.8% were native-born U.S. citizens with at least one immigrant parent. Numbering approximately 678,255 according to the 2019 survey, the majority of Michigander immigrants came from Mexico (11.5%), India (11.3%), Iraq (7.5%), China (5.3%), and Canada (5.3%); the primary occupations of its immigrants were technology, agriculture, and healthcare. Among its immigrant cohort, there were 108,105 undocumented immigrants, making up 15.9% of the total immigrant population.\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 8,206 homeless people in Michigan.\nRace and ethnicity.\nSince colonial European and American settlement, the majority of Michigan's population has been predominantly non-Hispanic or non-Latino white; Americans of European descent live throughout every county in the state, and most of Metro Detroit. Large European American groups include those of German, British, Irish, Polish and Belgian ancestry. Scandinavian and Finnish Americans have a notable presence in the Upper Peninsula. Western Michigan is known for its Dutch heritage, especially in Holland and metropolitan Grand Rapids.\nBlack and African Americans\u2014coming to Detroit and other northern cities in the Great Migration of the early 20th century\u2014have formed a majority of the population in Detroit and other cities including Flint and Benton Harbor. Since the 2021 census estimates\u2014while Detroit was still the largest city in Michigan with a majority black population\u2014it was no longer the largest black-majority city in the U.S., citing crime and higher-paying jobs given to whites.\nAs of 2007[ [update]], about 300,000 people in Southeastern Michigan trace their descent from the Middle East and Asia. Dearborn has a sizeable Arab American community, with many Assyrians, and Lebanese who immigrated for jobs in the auto industry in the 1920s, along with more recent Yemenis and Iraqis. Dearborn also houses an Armenian minority population, initially consisting of entirely young men. There is a statue of Komitas, an Armenian priest and composer, standing on Jefferson Avenue, in Detroit. As of 2007[ [update]], almost 8,000 Hmong people lived in the state of Michigan, about double their 1999 presence in the state. Most lived in northeastern Detroit, but they had been increasingly moving to Pontiac and Warren. By 2015, the number of Hmong in the Detroit city limits had significantly declined. Lansing hosts a statewide Hmong New Year Festival. The Hmong community also had a prominent portrayal in the 2008 film \"Gran Torino\", which was set in Detroit.\nAs of 2015[ [update]], 80% of Michigan's Japanese population lived in the counties of Macomb, Oakland, Washtenaw, and Wayne in the Detroit and Ann Arbor areas. As of April\u00a02013[ [update]], the largest Japanese national population is in Novi, with 2,666 Japanese residents, and the next largest populations are respectively in Ann Arbor, West Bloomfield Township, Farmington Hills, and Battle Creek. The state has 481 Japanese employment facilities providing 35,554 local jobs. 391 of them are in Southeast Michigan, providing 20,816 jobs, and the 90 in other regions in the state provide 14,738 jobs. The Japanese Direct Investment Survey of the Consulate-General of Japan, Detroit stated more than 2,208 additional Japanese residents were employed in the State of Michigan as of 2012[ [update]], than in 2011. During the 1990s, the Japanese population of Michigan experienced an increase, and many Japanese people with children moved to particular areas for their proximity to Japanese grocery stores and high-performing schools.\nLanguages.\nIn 2010, about 91.11% (8,507,947) of Michigan residents age five and older spoke only English at home, while 2.93% (273,981) spoke Spanish, 1.04% (97,559) Arabic, 0.44% (41,189) German, 0.36% (33,648) Chinese (which includes Mandarin), 0.31% (28,891) French, 0.29% (27,019) Polish, and Syriac languages (such as Modern Aramaic and Northeastern Neo-Aramaic) was spoken as a main language by 0.25% (23,420) of the population over the age of five. In total, 8.89% (830,281) of Michigan's population age five and older spoke a mother language other than English. Since 2021, 90.1% of residents aged five and older spoke only English at home, and Spanish was the second-most spoken language with 2.9% of the population speaking it.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFollowing British and French colonization of the region surrounding Michigan, Christianity became the dominant religion, with Roman Catholicism historically being the largest single Christian group for the state. Until the 19th century, the Roman Catholic Church was the only organized religious group in Michigan, reflecting the territory's French colonial roots. Detroit's St. Anne's parish, established in 1701 by Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, is the second-oldest Roman Catholic parish in the United States. On March 8, 1833, the Holy See formally established a diocese in the Michigan territory, which included all of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and the Dakotas east of the Mississippi River. When Michigan became a state in 1837, the boundary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Detroit was redrawn to coincide with that of the state; the other dioceses were later carved out from the Detroit Diocese but remain part of the Ecclesiastical Province of Detroit. Several Native American religions have been practiced in Michigan.\nIn 2020, there were 1,492,732 adherents of Roman Catholicism. There's also a significant Independent Catholic presence in Metro Detroit, including the Ecumenical Catholic Church of Christ established by Archbishop Karl Rodig; the see of this church operates in a former Roman Catholic parish church.\nWith the introduction of Protestantism to the state, it began to form the largest collective Christian group. In 2010, the Association of Religion Data Archives reported the largest Protestant denomination was the United Methodist Church with 228,521 adherents; followed by the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod with 219,618, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America with 120,598 adherents. The Christian Reformed Church in North America had almost 100,000 members and more than 230 congregations in Michigan. The Reformed Church in America had 76,000 members and 154 congregations in the state. By the 2020 study, non- and inter-denominational Protestant churches formed the largest Protestant group in Michigan, numbering 508,904. The Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod grew to become the second-largest single Christian denomination, and United Methodists declined to being the third-largest. The Lutheran Protestant tradition was introduced by German and Scandinavian immigrants. Altogether, Baptists numbered 321,581 between the National Missionary Baptists, National Baptists, American Baptists, Southern Baptists, National Baptists of America, Progressive National Baptists, and Full Gospel Baptists; black Baptists formed the largest constituency. In West Michigan, Dutch immigrants fled from the specter of religious persecution and famine in the Netherlands around 1850 and settled in and around what is now Holland, Michigan, establishing a \"colony\" on American soil that fervently held onto Calvinist doctrine that established a significant presence of Reformed churches.\nIn the same 2010 survey, Jewish adherents in the state of Michigan were estimated at 44,382, and Muslims at 120,351. The first Jewish synagogue in the state was Temple Beth El, founded by twelve German Jewish families in Detroit in 1850. Islam was introduced by immigrants from the Near East during the 20th century. Michigan is home to the largest mosque in North America, the Islamic Center of America in Dearborn. Battle Creek, Michigan, is also the birthplace of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which was founded on May 21, 1863.\nEconomy.\nIn 2022, 3,939,076 people in Michigan were employed at 227,870 establishments, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated Michigan's Q1 2025 gross state product to be $725.897 billion, ranking 14th out of the 50 states. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of November\u00a02024[ [update]], the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was estimated at 4.8%.\nProducts and services include automobiles, food products, information technology, aerospace, military equipment, furniture, and mining of copper and iron ore. Michigan is the third-largest grower of Christmas trees with of land dedicated to Christmas tree farming in 2007. The beverage Vernors Ginger Ale was invented in Michigan in 1866, sharing the title of oldest soft drink with Hires Root Beer. Faygo was founded in Detroit on November 4, 1907. Two of the top four pizza chains were founded in Michigan and are headquartered there: Domino's Pizza by Tom Monaghan and Little Caesars Pizza by Mike Ilitch. Michigan became the 24th right-to-work state in the U.S. in 2012, however, in 2023 this law was repealed.\nSince 2009, GM, Ford and Chrysler have managed a significant reorganization of their benefit funds structure after a volatile stock market which followed the September 11 attacks and early 2000s recession impacted their respective U.S. pension and benefit funds (OPEB). General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler reached agreements with the United Auto Workers Union to transfer the liabilities for their respective health care and benefit funds to a 501(c)(9) Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA). Manufacturing in the state grew 6.6% from 2001 to 2006, but the high speculative price of oil became a factor for the U.S. auto industry during the economic crisis of 2008 impacting industry revenues. In 2009, GM and Chrysler emerged from Chapter 11 restructurings with financing provided in part by the U.S. and Canadian governments. GM began its initial public offering (IPO) of stock in 2010. For 2010, the Big Three domestic automakers have reported significant profits indicating the beginning of rebound.\nAs of 2002[ [update]], Michigan ranked fourth in the U.S. in high-tech employment with 568,000 high-tech workers, which includes 70,000 in the automotive industry. Michigan typically ranks third or fourth in overall research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures in the United States. Its research and development, which includes automotive, comprises a higher percentage of the state's overall gross domestic product than for any other U.S. state. The state is an important source of engineering job opportunities. The domestic auto industry accounts directly and indirectly for one of every ten jobs in the U.S.\nMichigan was second in the U.S. in 2004 for new corporate facilities and expansions. From 1997 to 2004, Michigan was the only state to top the 10,000 mark for the number of major new developments; however, the effects of the late 2000s recession have slowed the state's economy. In 2008, Michigan placed third in a site selection survey among the states for luring new business which measured capital investment and new job creation per one million population. In August 2009, Michigan and Detroit's auto industry received $1.36 B in grants from the U.S. Department of Energy for the manufacture of electric vehicle technologies which is expected to generate 6,800 immediate jobs and employ 40,000 in the state by 2020. From 2007 to 2009, Michigan ranked 3rd in the U.S. for new corporate facilities and expansions.\nAs leading research institutions, the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State University are important partners in the state's economy and its University Research Corridor. Michigan's public universities attract more than $1.5 B in research and development grants each year. The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory is at Michigan State University. Michigan's workforce is well-educated and highly skilled, making it attractive to companies. It has the third highest number of engineering graduates nationally.\nDetroit Metropolitan Airport is one of the nation's most recently expanded and modernized airports with six major runways, and large aircraft maintenance facilities capable of servicing and repairing a Boeing 747 and is a major hub for Delta Air Lines. Michigan's schools and colleges rank among the nation's best. The state has maintained its early commitment to public education. The state's infrastructure gives it a competitive edge; Michigan has 38 deep water ports. In 2007, Bank of America announced that it would commit $25\u00a0billion to community development in Michigan following its acquisition of LaSalle Bank in Troy.\nMichigan was reported to have led the nation in job creation improvement in 2010 according to the Gallup Job Creation Index. A 2015 release of the survey also placed Michigan toward the top of the rankings.\nOn December 20, 2019, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed a package of bills into law effectively legalizing online gambling activities in Michigan, which allowed commercial and tribal casinos to apply for internet gaming licenses.\nTaxation.\nMichigan's personal income tax is a flat rate of 4.25%. In addition, 24 cities impose income taxes; rates are set at 1% for residents and 0.5% for non-residents in all but four cities. Michigan's state sales tax is 6%, though items such as food and medication are exempted. Property taxes are assessed on the local level, but every property owner's local assessment contributes six mills (a rate of $6 per $1000 of property value) to the statutory State Education Tax. Property taxes are appealable to local boards of review and need the approval of the local electorate to exceed millage rates prescribed by state law and local charters. In 2011, the state repealed its business tax and replaced it with a 6% corporate income tax which substantially reduced taxes on business. Article IX of the Constitution of the State of Michigan also provides limitations on how much the state can tax.\nA 6% use tax is levied on goods purchased outside the state (that are brought in and used in state), at parity with the sales tax. The use tax applies to internet sales/purchases from outside Michigan and is equivalent to the sales tax.\nAgriculture.\nA wide variety of commodity crops, fruits, and vegetables are grown in Michigan, making it second only to California among US states in the diversity of its agriculture. The state has 54,800 farms utilizing of land which sold $6.49\u00a0billion worth of products in 2010. The most valuable agricultural product is milk. Leading crops include corn, soybeans, flowers, wheat, sugar beets, and potatoes. Livestock in the state included 78,000 sheep, a million cattle, a million hogs, and more than three million chickens. Livestock products accounted for 38% of the value of agricultural products while crops accounted for the majority.\nMichigan is a leading grower of fruit in the US, including blueberries, tart cherries, apples, grapes, and peaches. \nMichigan produces 70 percent of the country's cherries. Most of these cherries are Montmorency cherries.\nPlums, pears, and strawberries are also grown in Michigan. These fruits are mainly grown in West Michigan due to the moderating effect of Lake Michigan on the climate. There is also significant fruit production, especially cherries, but also grapes, apples, and other fruits, in northwest Michigan along Lake Michigan. Michigan produces wines, beers and a multitude of processed food products. Kellogg's cereal is based in Battle Creek, Michigan and processes many locally grown foods. Thornapple Valley, Ball Park Franks, Koegel Meat Company, and Hebrew National sausage companies are all based in Michigan.\nMichigan is home to very fertile land in the Saginaw Valley and Thumb areas. Products grown there include corn, sugar beets, navy beans, and soybeans. Sugar beet harvesting usually begins the first of October. It takes the sugar factories about five months to process the 3.7\u00a0million tons of sugarbeets into 485,000 tons of pure, white sugar. Michigan's largest sugar refiner, Michigan Sugar Company is the largest east of the Mississippi River and the fourth largest in the nation. Michigan sugar brand names are Pioneer Sugar and the newly incorporated Big Chief Sugar. Potatoes are grown in Northern Michigan, and corn is dominant in Central Michigan. Alfalfa, cucumbers, and asparagus are also grown.\nTourism.\nAs of 2011, Michigan's tourists spent $17.2 billion per year in the state, supporting 193,000 tourism jobs. Michigan's tourism website ranks among the busiest in the nation. Destinations draw vacationers, hunters, and nature enthusiasts from across the United States and Canada. Michigan is over 50% forest land, much of it quite remote. The forests, lakes and thousands of miles of beaches are top attractions. Event tourism draws large numbers to occasions like the Tulip Time Festival and the National Cherry Festival.\nIn 2006, the Michigan State Board of Education mandated all public schools in the state hold their first day of school after Labor Day, in accordance with the new post-Labor Day school law. A survey found 70% of all tourism business comes directly from Michigan residents, and the Michigan Hotel, Motel, &amp; Resort Association claimed the shorter summer between school years cut into the annual tourism season. However, a bill introduced in 2023 would cancel this requirement, allowing individual districts to decide when their school year should begin.\nTourism in metropolitan Detroit draws visitors to leading attractions, especially The Henry Ford, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Detroit Zoo, and to sports in Detroit. Other museums include the Detroit Historical Museum, the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, museums in the Cranbrook Educational Community, and the Arab American National Museum. The metro area offers four major casinos, MGM Grand Detroit, Hollywood Casino, Motor City, and Caesars Windsor in Windsor, Ontario, Canada; moreover, Detroit is the largest American city and metropolitan region to offer casino resorts.\nHunting and fishing are significant industries in the state. Charter boats are based in many Great Lakes cities to fish for salmon, trout, walleye, and perch. Michigan ranks first in the nation in licensed hunters (over one million) who contribute $2 billion annually to its economy. More than three-quarters of a million hunters participate in white-tailed deer season alone. Many school districts in rural areas of Michigan cancel school on the opening day of firearm deer season, because of attendance concerns.\nMichigan's Department of Natural Resources manages the largest dedicated state forest system in the nation. The forest products industry and recreational users contribute $12 billion and 200,000 associated jobs annually to the state's economy. Public hiking and hunting access has also been secured in extensive commercial forests. The state has the highest number of golf courses and registered snowmobiles in the nation.\nThe state has numerous historical markers, which can themselves become the center of a tour. The Great Lakes Circle Tour is a designated scenic road system connecting all of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.\nWith its position in relation to the Great Lakes and the countless ships that have foundered over the many years they have been used as a transport route for people and bulk cargo, Michigan is a world-class scuba diving destination. The Michigan Underwater Preserves are 13 underwater areas where wrecks are protected for the benefit of sport divers.\nCulture.\nArts.\nMusic.\nMichigan music is known for three music trends: early punk rock, Motown/soul music and techno music. Michigan musicians include Tally Hall, Bill Haley &amp; His Comets, the Supremes, the Marvelettes, the Temptations, the Four Tops, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye \"The Prince of Soul\", Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Aretha Franklin, Mary Wells, Tommy James and the Shondells, ? and the Mysterians, Al Green, The Spinners, Grand Funk Railroad, the Stooges, the MC5, the Knack, Madonna \"The Queen of Pop\", Bob Seger, Jack Scott, Ray Parker Jr., Jackie Wilson, Aaliyah, Eminem, Babytron, Kid Rock, Jack White and Meg White (the White Stripes), Big Sean, Alice Cooper, Greta Van Fleet, Mustard Plug, and Del Shannon.\nPerformance arts.\nMajor theaters in Michigan include the Fox Theatre, Music Hall, Gem Theatre, Masonic Temple Theatre, the Detroit Opera House, Fisher Theatre, The Fillmore Detroit, Saint Andrew's Hall, Majestic Theater, and Orchestra Hall.\nThe Nederlander Organization, the largest controller of Broadway productions in New York City, originated in Detroit.\nSports.\nMichigan's major-league sports teams include: Detroit Tigers baseball team, Detroit Lions football team, Detroit Red Wings ice hockey team, and the Detroit Pistons men's basketball team. All of Michigan's major league teams play in the Metro Detroit area. The state also has a professional second-tier (USL Championship) soccer team in Detroit City FC, which plays its home games at Keyworth Stadium in Hamtramck, Michigan.\nThe Pistons played at Detroit's Cobo Arena until 1978 and at the Pontiac Silverdome until 1988 when they moved into The Palace of Auburn Hills. In 2017, the team moved to the newly built Little Caesars Arena in downtown Detroit. The Detroit Lions played at Tiger Stadium in Detroit until 1974, then moved to the Pontiac Silverdome where they played for 27 years between 1975 and 2002 before moving to Ford Field in Detroit in 2002. The Detroit Tigers played at Tiger Stadium (formerly known as Navin Field and Briggs Stadium) from 1912 to 1999. In 2000, they moved to Comerica Park. The Red Wings played at Olympia Stadium before moving to Joe Louis Arena in 1979. They later moved to Little Caesars Arena to join the Pistons as tenants in 2017. Professional hockey got its start in 1903 in Houghton, Michigan, when the Portage Lakers were formed.\nThe Michigan International Speedway is the site of NASCAR races and Detroit was formerly the site of a Formula One World Championship Grand Prix race. From 1959 to 1961, Detroit Dragway hosted the NHRA's U.S. Nationals. Michigan is home to one of the major canoeing marathons: the Au Sable River Canoe Marathon. The Port Huron to Mackinac Boat Race is also a favorite.\nTwenty-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams was born in Saginaw. The 2011 World Champion for Women's Artistic Gymnastics, Jordyn Wieber is from DeWitt. Wieber was also a member of the gold medal team at the London Olympics in 2012.\nCollegiate sports in Michigan are popular in addition to professional sports. The state's two largest athletic programs are the Michigan Wolverines and Michigan State Spartans. They compete in the NCAA Big Ten Conference for most sports. The Michigan High School Athletic Association features around 300,000 participants.\nEducation.\nMichigan's education system serves nearly 1.4 million K-12 students in public schools as of the 2024\u201325 school year. In 2008\u201309, more than 124,000 students attend private schools and an uncounted number are homeschooled under certain legal requirements. The public school system had a $14.5 billion budget in 2008\u201309. From 2009 to 2019, over 200 private schools in Michigan closed, partly due to competition from charter schools. In 2022, \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" rated three Michigan high schools among the nation's 100 best: City High Middle School (18th), the International Academy of Macomb (21st), and the International Academy (52nd). Washtenaw International High School ranked 107th.\nThe University of Michigan is Michigan's oldest higher educational institution and among the oldest research universities in the nation. It was founded in 1817, 20 years before Michigan Territory achieved statehood. Kalamazoo College is the state's oldest private liberal arts college, founded in 1833 by a group of Baptist ministers as the Michigan and Huron Institute. From 1840 to 1850, the college operated as the Kalamazoo Branch of the University of Michigan. Methodist settlers in Spring Arbor Township founded Albion College in 1835. It is the state's second-oldest private liberal arts college.\nMichigan Technological University is the first post-secondary institution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, founded in 1885 as the Michigan Mining School. Eastern Michigan University was founded in 1849 as the Michigan State Normal School for the training of teachers. It was the nation's fourth-oldest normal school and the first U.S. normal school outside New England. In 1899, the Michigan State Normal School became the nation's first normal school to offer a four-year curriculum. Michigan State University was founded in 1855 as the nation's first agricultural college.\nThe Carnegie Foundation classifies eight of the state's institutions (Michigan State University, Michigan Technological University, Eastern Michigan University, Wayne State University, Central Michigan University, Western Michigan University, Oakland University, University of Michigan) as research universities.\nThe state of Michigan has six MD-granting medical schools: Central Michigan University College of Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, and Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine. Additionally, Michigan is home to five American Bar Association accredited law schools: Michigan State University College of Law, Cooley Law School, University of Detroit Mercy School of Law, University of Michigan Law School, and Wayne State University Law School.\nInfrastructure.\nEnergy.\nIn 2020, Michigan consumed 113,740- gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electrical energy and produced 116,700 (GWh) of electrical energy.\nCoal power is Michigan's leading source of electricity, producing roughly half its supply or 53,100 GWh of electrical energy (12.6 GW total capacity) in 2020. Although Michigan has no active coal mines, coal is easily moved from other states by train and across the Great Lakes by lake freighters. The lower price of natural gas is leading to the closure of most coal plants, with Consumer Energy planning to close all of its remaining coal plants by 2025; DTE plans to retire 2100MW of coal power by 2023. The coal-fired Monroe Power Plant in Monroe, on the western shore of Lake Erie, is the nation's 11th-largest electric plant, with a net capacity of 3,400 MW.\nNuclear power is also a significant source of electrical power in Michigan, producing roughly one-quarter of the state's supply or 28,000-gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electrical energy (4.3 GW total capacity) in 2020. The three active nuclear power plants supply Michigan with about 26% of its electricity. Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, just north of Bridgman, is the state's largest nuclear power plant, with a net capacity of 2,213 MW. The Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station is the second-largest, with a net capacity of 1,150 MW. It is also one of the two nuclear power plants in the Detroit metropolitan area (within a 50-mile radius of Detroit's city center), about halfway between Detroit and Toledo, Ohio, the other being the Davis\u2013Besse Nuclear Power Station, in Ottawa County, Ohio. The Palisades Nuclear Power Plant, south of South Haven, closed in May 2022. The Big Rock Point Nuclear Power Plant, Michigan's first nuclear power plant and the nation's fifth, was decommissioned in 1997.\nUtility companies were required to generate at least 10% of their energy from renewable sources by 2015, under Public Act 295 of 2008. In 2016, the legislature set another mandate to reach at least 12.5% renewable energy by 2019 and 15% by end of year 2021, which all utilities subject to the law successfully met. By the end of 2022, Michigan had at least 6 GW of renewable generating capacity, and was projected to have at least 8 GW by the end of 2026. Wind energy accounted for 59% of all Michigan energy credits in 2021.\nTransportation.\nInternational crossings.\nMichigan has seven international crossings with Ontario, Canada:\nThe Gordie Howe International Bridge, a second international bridge between Detroit and Windsor, is under construction. It is expected to be completed in early 2026.\nMichigan only has one major ferry service still in operation with Ontario, the Walpole\u2013Algonac Ferry, after the closures of the Bluewater Ferry and the Detroit\u2013Windsor Truck Ferry.\nRailroads.\nMichigan is served by four Class I railroads: the Canadian National Railway, the Canadian Pacific Railway, CSX Transportation, and the Norfolk Southern Railway. These are augmented by several dozen short line railroads. The vast majority of rail service in Michigan is devoted to freight, with Amtrak and various scenic railroads the exceptions.\nThree Amtrak passenger rail routes serve the state. The Pere Marquette from Chicago to Grand Rapids, the Blue Water from Chicago to Port Huron, and the Wolverine from Chicago to Pontiac. There are plans for commuter rail for Detroit and its suburbs (see SEMCOG Commuter Rail).\nAirports.\nDetroit Metropolitan Airport in the western suburb of Romulus, was in 2010 the 16th busiest airfield in North America measured by passenger traffic. The Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Grand Rapids is the next busiest airport in the state, served by eight airlines to 23 destinations. Flint Bishop International Airport is the third largest airport in the state, served by four airlines to several primary hubs. Other frequently trafficked airports include Cherry Capital Airport, in Traverse City; Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport, serving the Kalamazoo and Battle Creek region; Capital Region International Airport, located outside of Lansing; and MBS International Airport serving the Midland, Bay City and Saginaw tri-city region. Additionally, smaller regional and local airports are located throughout the state including on several islands.\nGovernment.\nState government.\nMichigan is governed as a republic, with three branches of government: the executive branch consisting of the Governor of Michigan and the other independently elected constitutional officers; the legislative branch consisting of the House of Representatives and Senate; and the judicial branch. The Michigan Constitution allows for the direct participation of the electorate by statutory initiative and referendum, recall, and constitutional initiative and referral (Article II, \u00a7 9, defined as \"the power to propose laws and to enact and reject laws, called the initiative, and the power to approve or reject laws enacted by the legislature, called the referendum. The power of initiative extends only to laws which the legislature may enact under this constitution\"). Lansing is the state capital and is home to all three branches of state government.\nThe governor and the other state constitutional officers serve four-year terms and may be re-elected only once. The current governor is Gretchen Whitmer. Michigan has two official Governor's Residences; one is in Lansing, and the other is on Mackinac Island. The other constitutionally elected executive officers are the lieutenant governor, who is elected on a joint ticket with the governor; the secretary of state; and the attorney general. The lieutenant governor presides over the Senate (voting only in case of a tie) and is also a member of the cabinet. The secretary of state is the chief elections officer and is charged with running many licensure programs including motor vehicles, all of which are done through the branch offices of the secretary of state.\nThe Michigan Legislature consists of a 38-member Senate and 110-member House of Representatives. Members of both houses of the legislature are elected through first past the post elections by single-member electoral districts of near-equal population that often have boundaries which coincide with county and municipal lines. Senators serve four-year terms concurrent to those of the governor, while representatives serve two-year terms. The Michigan State Capitol was dedicated in 1879 and has hosted the executive and legislative branches of the state ever since.\nThe Michigan judiciary consists of two courts with primary jurisdiction (the Circuit Courts and the District Courts), one intermediate level appellate court (the Michigan Court of Appeals), and the Michigan Supreme Court. There are several administrative courts and specialized courts. District courts are trial courts of limited jurisdiction, handling most traffic violations, small claims, misdemeanors, and civil suits where the amount contended is below $25,000. District courts are often responsible for handling the preliminary examination and for setting bail in felony cases. District court judges are elected to terms of six years. In a few locations, municipal courts have been retained to the exclusion of the establishment of district courts. There are 57 circuit courts in the State of Michigan, which have original jurisdiction over all civil suits where the amount contended in the case exceeds $25,000 and all criminal cases involving felonies. Circuit courts are also the only trial courts in the State of Michigan which possess the power to issue equitable remedies. Circuit courts have appellate jurisdiction from district and municipal courts, as well as from decisions and decrees of state agencies. Most counties have their own circuit court, but sparsely populated counties often share them. Circuit court judges are elected to terms of six years. State appellate court judges are elected to terms of six years, but vacancies are filled by an appointment by the governor. There are four divisions of the Court of Appeals in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Lansing, and Marquette. Cases are heard by the Court of Appeals by panels of three judges, who examine the application of the law and not the facts of the case unless there has been grievous error pertaining to questions of fact. The Michigan Supreme Court consists of seven members who are elected on non-partisan ballots for staggered eight-year terms. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction only in narrow circumstances but holds appellate jurisdiction over the entire state judicial system.\nLaw.\nMichigan has had four constitutions, the first of which was ratified on October5 and 6, 1835. There were also constitutions from 1850 and 1908, in addition to the current constitution from 1963. The current document has a preamble, 11 articles, and one section consisting of a schedule and temporary provisions. The current constitution also includes a provision beginning in the general election held in 1978, and every 16 years thereafter, the question of a general revision of the constitution shall be submitted to the electors of the state, next scheduled to be considered November 2026. Michigan, like every U.S. state except Louisiana, has a common law legal system.\nPolitics.\nHaving been a Democratic-leaning state at the presidential level since the 1990s, Michigan has evolved into a swing state after Donald Trump won the state in 2016. He then won it again in 2024, after losing it by a slim 2.8% to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. Governors since the 1970s have alternated between the Democrats and Republicans, and statewide offices including attorney general, secretary of state, and senator have been held by members of both parties in varying proportion. Additionally, from 1994 until 2022, the governor-elect had always come from the party opposite the presidency. Following the 2024 elections, control of Michigan Legislature is split, with the Democratic Party having a slim majority of two seats in the Senate while the Republican Party holds a 58-seat majority in the House. The state's congressional delegation is commonly split, with one party or the other typically holding a narrow majority; as of 2025 Republicans have a 7\u20136 majority.\nMichigan was the home of Gerald Ford, the 38th president of the United States. Born in Nebraska, he moved as an infant to Grand Rapids. The Gerald R. Ford Museum is in Grand Rapids, and the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library is on the campus of his alma mater, the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\nIn a 2020 study, Michigan was ranked as the 13th easiest state for citizens to vote in. Amendments to the constitution in 2020 and 2022 also provide for voting by mail, audits of statewide election results, and to vote free of harassment, threats, and intimidation. The Cato Institute ranks Michigan 7th in its overall ranking for personal and economic freedom in the United States in the 2021 and 2023 editions of its \"Freedom in the 50 States\" index. In 2022, Michigan voters passed an amendment recognizing abortion and contraceptive rights within the state's constitution.\nState symbols and nicknames.\nMichigan is traditionally known as \"The Wolverine State\", and the University of Michigan uses the wolverine as its mascot. The association is well and long established: for example, many Detroiters volunteered to fight during the American Civil War and George Armstrong Custer, who led the Michigan Brigade, called them the \"Wolverines\". The origins of this association are obscure; it may derive from a busy trade in wolverine furs in Sault Ste. Marie in the 18th century or may recall a disparagement intended to compare early settlers in Michigan with the vicious mammal. Wolverines are, however, extremely rare in Michigan. A sighting in February 2004 near Ubly was the first confirmed sighting in Michigan in 200 years. Another wolverine was found dead in 2010.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most countries had introduced minimum wage legislation by the end of the 20th century. Because minimum wages increase the cost of labor, companies often try to avoid minimum wage laws by using gig workers, by moving labor to locations with lower or nonexistent minimum wages, or by automating job functions. Minimum wage policies can vary significantly between countries or even within a country, with different regions, sectors, or age groups having their own minimum wage rates. These variations are often influenced by factors such as the cost of living, regional economic conditions, and industry-specific factors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Bar chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe movement for minimum wages was first motivated as a way to stop the exploitation of workers in sweatshops, by employers who were thought to have unfair bargaining power over them. Over time, minimum wages came to be seen as a way to help lower-income families. Modern national laws enforcing compulsory union membership which prescribed minimum wages for their members were first passed in New Zealand in 1894. Although minimum wage laws are now in effect in many jurisdictions, differences of opinion exist about the benefits and drawbacks of a minimum wage. Additionally, minimum wage policies can be implemented through various methods, such as directly legislating specific wage rates, setting a formula that adjusts the minimum wage based on economic indicators, or having wage boards that determine minimum wages in consultation with representatives from employers, employees, and the government.\nSupply and demand models suggest that there may be employment losses from minimum wages; however, minimum wages can increase the efficiency of the labor market in monopsony scenarios, where individual employers have a degree of wage-setting power over the market as a whole. Supporters of the minimum wage say it increases the standard of living of workers, reduces poverty, reduces inequality, and boosts morale. In contrast, opponents of the minimum wage say it increases poverty and unemployment because some low-wage workers \"will be unable to find work ... [and] will be pushed into the ranks of the unemployed\".\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"It is a serious national evil that any class of his Majesty's subjects should receive less than a living wage in return for their utmost exertions. It was formerly supposed that the working of the laws of supply and demand would naturally regulate or eliminate that evil ... [and] ... ultimately produce a fair price. Where ... you have a powerful organisation on both sides ... there you have a healthy bargaining ... But where you have what we call sweated trades, you have no organisation, no parity of bargaining, the good employer is undercut by the bad, and the bad employer is undercut by the worst ... where those conditions prevail you have not a condition of progress, but a condition of progressive degeneration.\"\n Winston Churchill MP, Trade Boards Bill, Hansard House of Commons (28 April 1909) vol 4, https://\nModern minimum wage laws trace their origin to the Ordinance of Labourers (1349), which was a decree by King Edward III that set a\" maximum wage\" for laborers in medieval England. Edward, who was a wealthy landowner, was dependent, like his lords, on serfs to work the land. In the autumn of 1348, the Black Plague reached England and decimated the population. The severe shortage of labor caused wages to soar and encouraged King Edward III to set a wage ceiling. Subsequent amendments to the ordinance, such as the Statute of Labourers (1351), increased the penalties for paying a wage above the set rates.\nWhile the laws governing wages initially set a ceiling on compensation, they were eventually used to set a living wage. An amendment to the Statute of Labourers in 1389 effectively fixed wages to the price of food. As time passed, the Justice of the Peace, who was charged with setting the maximum wage, also began to set formal minimum wages. The practice was eventually formalized with the passage of the Act Fixing a Minimum Wage in 1604 by King James I for workers in the textile industry.\nBy the early 19th century, the Statutes of Labourers was repealed as the increasingly capitalistic United Kingdom embraced \"laissez-faire\" policies which disfavored regulations of wages (whether upper or lower limits). The subsequent 19th century saw significant labor unrest affect many industrial nations. As trade unions were decriminalized during the century, attempts to control wages through collective agreement were made.\nIt was not until the 1890s that the first modern legislative attempts to regulate minimum wages were seen in New Zealand and Australia. The movement for a minimum wage was initially focused on stopping sweatshop labor and controlling the proliferation of sweatshops in manufacturing industries. The sweatshops employed large numbers of women and young workers, paying them what were considered to be substandard wages. The sweatshop owners were thought to have unfair bargaining power over their employees, and a minimum wage was proposed as a means to make them pay fairly. Over time, the focus changed to helping people, especially families, become more self-sufficient.\nIn the United States, the late 19th-century ideas for favoring a minimum wage also coincided with the eugenics movement. As a consequence, some economists at the time, including Royal Meeker and Henry Rogers Seager, argued for the adoption of a minimum wage not only to support the worker, but to support their desired semi- and skilled laborers while forcing the undesired workers (including the idle, immigrants, women, racial minorities, and the disabled) out of the labor market. The result, over the longer term, would be to limit the nondesired workers' ability to earn money and have families, and thereby, remove them from the economists' ideal society.\nMinimum wage laws.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"It seems to me to be equally plain that no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country.\"\n President Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1933\nThe first modern national minimum wages were enacted by the government recognition of unions which in turn established minimum wage policy among their members, as in New Zealand in 1894, followed by Australia in 1896 and the United Kingdom in 1909. In the United States, statutory minimum wages were first introduced nationally in 1938, and they were reintroduced and expanded in the United Kingdom in 1998. There is now legislation or binding collective bargaining regarding minimum wage in more than 90 percent of all countries. In the European Union, 21 out of 27 member states currently have national minimum wages. Other countries, such as Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy, have no minimum wage laws, but rely on employer groups and trade unions to set minimum earnings through collective bargaining.\nMinimum wage rates vary greatly across many different jurisdictions, not only in setting a particular amount of money\u2014for example $7.25 per hour ($14,500 per year) under certain US state laws (or $2.13 for employees who receive tips, which is known as the tipped minimum wage), $16.28 per hour in the U.S. state of Washington, or \u00a311.44 (for those aged 21+) in the United Kingdom\u2014but also in terms of which pay period (for example Russia and China set monthly minimum wages) or the scope of coverage. Currently the United States federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, though most states have a higher minimum wage. However, some states do not have a minimum wage law, such as Louisiana and Tennessee, and other states have minimum wages below the federal minimum wage such as Georgia and Wyoming, although the federal minimum wage is enforced in those states. Some jurisdictions allow employers to count tips given to their workers as credit towards the minimum wage levels. India was one of the first developing countries to introduce minimum wage policy in its law in 1948. However, it is rarely implemented, even by contractors of government agencies. In Mumbai, as of 2017, the minimum wage was Rs. 348/day.\nIndia also has one of the most complicated systems with more than 1,200 minimum wage rates depending on the geographical region.\nInformal minimum wages.\nCustoms, tight labor markets, and extra-legal pressures from governments or labor unions can each produce a \"de facto\" minimum wage. So can international public opinion, by pressuring multinational companies to pay Third World workers wages usually found in more industrialized countries. The latter situation in Southeast Asia and Latin America was publicized in the 2000s, but it existed with companies in West Africa in the middle of the 20th century.\nSetting minimum wage.\nAmong the indicators that might be used to establish an initial minimum wage rate are ones that minimize the loss of jobs while preserving international competitiveness. Among these are general economic conditions as measured by real and nominal gross domestic product; inflation; labor supply and demand; wage levels, distribution and differentials; employment terms; productivity growth; labor costs; business operating costs; the number and trend of bankruptcies; economic freedom rankings; standards of living and the prevailing average wage rate.\nIn the business sector, concerns include the expected increased cost of doing business, threats to profitability, rising levels of unemployment (and subsequent higher government expenditure on welfare benefits raising tax rates), and the possible knock-on effects to the wages of more experienced workers who might already be earning the new statutory minimum wage, or slightly more. Among workers and their representatives, political considerations weigh in as labor leaders seek to win support by demanding the highest possible rate. Other concerns include purchasing power, inflation indexing and standardized working hours.\nImpact of minimum wage on income inequality and poverty.\nMinimum wage policies have been debated for their impact on income inequality and poverty levels. Proponents argue that raising the minimum wage can help reduce income disparities, enabling low-income workers to afford basic necessities and contribute to the overall economy. Higher minimum wages may also have a ripple effect, pushing up wages for those earning slightly above the minimum wage.\nHowever, opponents contend that minimum wage increases can lead to job losses, particularly for low-skilled and entry-level workers, as businesses may be unable to afford higher labor costs and may respond by cutting jobs or hours. They also argue that minimum wage increases may not effectively target those living in poverty, as many minimum wage earners are secondary earners in households with higher incomes. Some studies suggest that targeted income support programs, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the United States, may be more effective in addressing poverty. The effectiveness of minimum wage policies in reducing income inequality and poverty remains a subject of ongoing debate and research.\nEconomic models.\nSupply and demand model.\nAccording to the supply and demand model of the labor market shown in many economics textbooks, increasing the minimum wage decreases the employment of minimum-wage workers. One such textbook states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If a higher minimum wage increases the wage rates of unskilled workers above the level that would be established by market forces, the quantity of unskilled workers employed will fall. The minimum wage will price the services of the least productive (and therefore lowest-wage) workers out of the market. ... the direct results of minimum wage legislation are clearly mixed. Some workers, most likely those whose previous wages were closest to the minimum, will enjoy higher wages. Others, particularly those with the lowest prelegislation wage rates, will be unable to find work. They will be pushed into the ranks of the unemployed.\nA firm's cost is an increasing function of the wage rate. The higher the wage rate, the fewer hours an employer will demand of employees. This is because, as the wage rate rises, it becomes more expensive for firms to hire workers and so firms hire fewer workers (or hire them for fewer hours). The demand of labor curve is therefore shown as a line moving down and to the right. Since higher wages increase the quantity supplied, the supply of labor curve is upward sloping, and is shown as a line moving up and to the right. If no minimum wage is in place, wages will adjust until the quantity of labor demanded is equal to quantity supplied, reaching equilibrium, where the supply and demand curves intersect. Minimum wage behaves as a classical price floor on labor. Standard theory says that, if set above the equilibrium price, more labor will be willing to be provided by workers than will be demanded by employers, creating a surplus of labor, i.e. unemployment. The economic model of markets predicts the same of other commodities (like milk and wheat, for example): Artificially raising the price of the commodity tends to cause an increase in quantity supplied and a decrease in quantity demanded. The result is a surplus of the commodity. When there is a wheat surplus, the government buys it. Since the government does not hire surplus labor, the labor surplus takes the form of unemployment, which tends to be higher with minimum wage laws than without them.\nThe supply and demand model implies that by mandating a price floor above the equilibrium wage, minimum wage laws will cause unemployment. This is because a greater number of people are willing to work at the higher wage while a smaller number of jobs will be available at the higher wage. Companies can be more selective in those whom they employ thus the least skilled and least experienced will typically be excluded. An imposition or increase of a minimum wage will generally only affect employment in the low-skill labor market, as the equilibrium wage is already at or below the minimum wage, whereas in higher skill labor markets the equilibrium wage is too high for a change in minimum wage to affect employment.\nMonopsony.\nThe supply and demand model predicts that raising the minimum wage helps workers whose wages are raised, and hurts people who are not hired (or lose their jobs) when companies cut back on employment. But proponents of the minimum wage hold that the situation is much more complicated than the model can account for. One complicating factor is possible monopsony in the labor market, whereby the individual employer has some market power in determining wages paid. Thus it is at least theoretically possible that the minimum wage may boost employment. Though single employer market power is unlikely to exist in most labor markets in the sense of the traditional 'company town,' asymmetric information, imperfect mobility, and the personal element of the labor transaction give some degree of wage-setting power to most firms.\nModern economic theory predicts that although an excessive minimum wage may raise unemployment as it fixes a price above most demand for labor, a minimum wage at a more reasonable level can increase employment, and enhance growth and efficiency. This is because labor markets are monopsonistic and workers persistently lack bargaining power. When poorer workers have more to spend it stimulates effective aggregate demand for goods and services.\nCriticisms of the supply and demand model.\nThe argument that a minimum wage decreases employment is based on a simple supply and demand model of the labor market. A number of economists, such as Pierangelo Garegnani, Robert L. Vienneau, and Arrigo Opocher and Ian Steedman, building on the work of Piero Sraffa, argue that that model, even given all its assumptions, is logically incoherent. Michael Anyadike-Danes and Wynne Godley argue, based on simulation results, that little of the empirical work done with the textbook model constitutes a potentially falsifiable theory, and consequently empirical evidence hardly exists for that model. Graham White argues, partially on the basis of Sraffianism, that the policy of increased labor market flexibility, including the reduction of minimum wages, does not have an \"intellectually coherent\" argument in economic theory.\nGary Fields, Professor of Labor Economics and Economics at Cornell University, argues that the standard textbook model for the minimum wage is ambiguous, and that the standard theoretical arguments incorrectly measure only a one-sector market. Fields says a two-sector market, where \"the self-employed, service workers, and farm workers are typically excluded from minimum-wage coverage ... [and with] one sector with minimum-wage coverage and the other without it [and possible mobility between the two],\" is the basis for better analysis. Through this model, Fields shows the typical theoretical argument to be ambiguous and says \"the predictions derived from the textbook model definitely do not carry over to the two-sector case. Therefore, since a non-covered sector exists nearly everywhere, the predictions of the textbook model simply cannot be relied on.\"\nAn alternate view of the labor market has low-wage labor markets characterized as monopsonistic competition wherein buyers (employers) have significantly more market power than do sellers (workers). This monopsony could be a result of intentional collusion between employers, or naturalistic factors such as segmented markets, search costs, information costs, imperfect mobility and the personal element of labor markets. Such a case is a type of market failure and results in workers being paid less than their marginal value. Under the monopsonistic assumption, an appropriately set minimum wage could increase both wages and employment, with the optimal level being equal to the marginal product of labor. This view emphasizes the role of minimum wages as a market regulation policy akin to antitrust policies, as opposed to an illusory \"free lunch\" for low-wage workers.\nAnother reason minimum wage may not affect employment in certain industries is that the demand for the product the employees produce is highly inelastic. For example, if management is forced to increase wages, management can pass on the increase in wage to consumers in the form of higher prices. Since demand for the product is highly inelastic, consumers continue to buy the product at the higher price and so the manager is not forced to lay off workers. Economist Paul Krugman argues this explanation neglects to explain why the firm was not charging this higher price absent the minimum wage.\nThree other possible reasons minimum wages do not affect employment were suggested by Alan Blinder: higher wages may reduce turnover, and hence training costs; raising the minimum wage may \"render moot\" the potential problem of recruiting workers at a higher wage than current workers; and minimum wage workers might represent such a small proportion of a business' cost that the increase is too small to matter. He admits that he does not know if these are correct, but argues that \"the list demonstrates that one can accept the new empirical findings and still be a card-carrying economist\".\nMathematical models of the minimum wage and frictional labor markets.\nThe following mathematical models are more quantitative in orientation, and highlight some of the difficulties in determining the impact of the minimum wage on labor market outcomes. Specifically, these models focus on labor markets with frictions and may result in positive or negative outcomes from raising the minimum wage, depending on the circumstances.\nWelfare and labor market participation.\nAssume that the decision to participate in the labor market results from a trade-off between being an unemployed job seeker and not participating at all. All individuals whose expected utility outside the labor market is less than the expected utility of an unemployed person formula_1 decide to participate in the labor market. In the basic search and matching model, the expected utility of unemployed persons formula_1 and that of employed persons formula_3 are defined by:\nformula_4Let formula_5 be the wage, formula_6 the interest rate, formula_7 the instantaneous income of unemployed persons, formula_8 the exogenous job destruction rate, formula_9 the labor market tightness, and formula_10 the job finding rate. The profits formula_11 and formula_12 expected from a filled job and a vacant one are:formula_13where formula_14 is the cost of a vacant job and formula_15 is the productivity. When the \"free entry condition\" formula_16 is satisfied, these two equalities yield the following relationship between the wage formula_5 and labor market tightness formula_9:\nformula_19If formula_5 represents a minimum wage that applies to all workers, this equation completely determines the equilibrium value of the labor market tightness formula_9. There are two conditions associated with the matching function:formula_22This implies that formula_9 is a decreasing function of the minimum wage formula_5, and so is the job finding rate formula_25. A hike in the minimum wage degrades the profitability of a job, so firms post fewer vacancies and the job finding rate falls off. Now let's rewrite formula_26 to be:formula_27Using the relationship between the wage and labor market tightness to eliminate the wage from the last equation gives us:\nformula_28 By maximizing formula_26 in this equation, with respect to the labor market tightness, it follows that:formula_30where formula_31 is the elasticity of the matching function:formula_32This result shows that the expected utility of unemployed workers is maximized when the minimum wage is set at a level that corresponds to the wage level of the decentralized economy in which the bargaining power parameter is equal to the elasticity formula_31. The level of the negotiated wage is formula_34.\nIf formula_35, then an increase in the minimum wage increases participation \"and\" the unemployment rate, with an ambiguous impact on employment. When the bargaining power of workers is less than formula_31, an increase in the minimum wage improves the welfare of the unemployed \u2013 this suggests that minimum wage hikes can improve labor market efficiency, at least up to the point when bargaining power equals formula_31.\nJob search effort.\nIn the model just presented, the minimum wage always increases unemployment. This result does not necessarily hold when the search effort of workers is endogenous.\nConsider a model where the intensity of the job search is designated by the scalar formula_38, which can be interpreted as the amount of time and/or intensity of the effort devoted to search. Assume that the arrival rate of job offers is formula_39 and that the wage distribution is degenerated to a single wage formula_5. Denote formula_41 to be the cost arising from the search effort, with formula_42. Then the discounted utilities are given by:formula_43Therefore, the optimal search effort is such that the marginal cost of performing the search is equation to the marginal return:formula_44This implies that the optimal search effort increases as the difference between the expected utility of the job holder and the expected utility of the job seeker grows. In fact, this difference actually grows with the wage. To see this, take the difference of the two discounted utilities to find:formula_45Then differentiating with respect to formula_5 and rearranging gives us:formula_47where formula_48 is the optimal search effort. This implies that a wage increase drives up job search effort and, therefore, the job finding rate. Additionally, the unemployment rate formula_49 at equilibrium is given by:formula_50A hike in the wage, which increases the search effort and the job finding rate, decreases the unemployment rate. So it is possible that a hike in the minimum wage \"may\", by boosting the search effort of job seekers, boost employment. Taken in sum with the previous section, the minimum wage in labor markets with frictions can improve employment and decrease the unemployment rate when it is sufficiently low. However, a high minimum wage is detrimental to employment and increases the unemployment rate.\nEmpirical studies.\nEconomists disagree as to the measurable impact of minimum wages in practice. This disagreement usually takes the form of competing empirical tests of the elasticities of supply and demand in labor markets and the degree to which markets differ from the efficiency that models of perfect competition predict.\nEconomists have done empirical studies on different aspects of the minimum wage, including:\nUntil the mid-1990s, a general consensus existed among economists\u2013both conservative and liberal\u2013that the minimum wage reduced employment, especially among younger and low-skill workers. In addition to the basic supply-demand intuition, there were a number of empirical studies that supported this view. For example, Edward Gramlich in 1976 found that many of the benefits went to higher income families, and that teenagers were made worse off by the unemployment associated with the minimum wage.\nBrown et al. (1983) noted that time series studies to that point had found that for a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, there was a decrease in teenage employment of 1\u20133 percent. However, the studies found wider variation, from 0 to over 3 percent, in their estimates for the effect on teenage unemployment (teenagers without a job and looking for one). In contrast to the simple supply and demand diagram, it was commonly found that teenagers withdrew from the labor force in response to the minimum wage, which produced the possibility of equal reductions in the supply as well as the demand for labor at a higher minimum wage and hence no impact on the unemployment rate. Using a variety of specifications of the employment and unemployment equations (using ordinary least squares vs. generalized least squares regression procedures, and linear vs. logarithmic specifications), they found that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage caused a 1 percent decrease in teenage employment, and no change in the teenage unemployment rate. The study also found a small, but statistically significant, increase in unemployment for adults aged 20\u201324.\nWellington (1991) updated Brown et al.'s research with data through 1986 to provide new estimates encompassing a period when the real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) value of the minimum wage was declining, because it had not increased since 1981. She found that a 10% increase in the minimum wage decreased the absolute teenage employment by 0.6%, with no effect on the teen or young adult unemployment rates.\nSome research suggests that the unemployment effects of small minimum wage increases are dominated by other factors. In Florida, where voters approved an increase in 2004, a follow-up comprehensive study after the increase confirmed a strong economy with increased employment above previous years in Florida and better than in the US as a whole. When it comes to on-the-job training, some believe the increase in wages is taken out of training expenses. A 2001 empirical study found that there is \"no evidence that minimum wages reduce training, and little evidence that they tend to increase training\".\n\"The Economist\" wrote in December 2013: \"A minimum wage, providing it is not set too high, could thus boost pay with no ill effects on jobs...America's federal minimum wage, at 38% of median income, is one of the rich world's lowest. Some studies find no harm to employment from federal or state minimum wages, others see a small one, but none finds any serious damage. ... High minimum wages, however, particularly in rigid labour markets, do appear to hit employment. France has the rich world's highest wage floor, at more than 60% of the median for adults and a far bigger fraction of the typical wage for the young. This helps explain why France also has shockingly high rates of youth unemployment: 26% for 15- to 24-year-olds.\"\nA 2019 study in the \"Quarterly Journal of Economics\" found that minimum wage increases did not have an impact on the overall number of low-wage jobs in the five years subsequent to the wage increase. However, it did find disemployment in 'tradable' sectors, defined as those sectors most reliant on entry-level or low-skilled labor.\nA 2018 study published by the university of California agrees with the study in the \"Quarterly Journal of Economics\" and discusses how minimum wages actually cause fewer jobs for low-skilled workers. Within the article it discusses a trade-off for low- to high-skilled workers that when the minimum wage is increased GDP is more highly redistributed to high academia jobs.\nIn another study, which shared authors with the above, published in the \"American Economic Review\" found that a large and persistent increase in the minimum wage in Hungary produced some disemployment, with the large majority of additional cost being passed on to consumers. The authors also found that firms began substituting capital for labor over time.\nA 2013 study published in the \"Science Direct\" journal agrees with the studies above as it describes that there is not a significant employment change due to increases in minimum wage. The study illustrates that there is not a-lot of national generalisability for minimum wage effects, studies done on one country often get generalised to others. Effect on employment can be low from minimum-wage policies, but these policies can also benefit welfare and poverty.\nDavid Card and Alan Krueger.\nIn 1992, the minimum wage in New Jersey increased from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour (an 18.8% increase), while in the adjacent state of Pennsylvania it remained at $4.25. David Card and Alan Krueger gathered information on fast food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania in an attempt to see what effect this increase had on employment within New Jersey via a Difference in differences model. A basic supply and demand model predicts that relative employment should have decreased in New Jersey. Card and Krueger surveyed employers before the April 1992 New Jersey increase, and again in November\u2013December 1992, asking managers for data on the full-time equivalent staff level of their restaurants both times. Based on data from the employers' responses, the authors concluded that the increase in the minimum wage slightly increased employment in the New Jersey restaurants.\nCard and Krueger expanded on this initial article in their 1995 book \"Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage\". They argued that the negative employment effects of minimum wage laws are minimal if not non-existent. For example, they look at the 1992 increase in New Jersey's minimum wage, the 1988 rise in California's minimum wage, and the 1990\u201391 increases in the federal minimum wage. In addition to their own findings, they reanalyzed earlier studies with updated data, generally finding that the older results of a negative employment effect did not hold up in the larger datasets. This had major implications on policy, challenging long-held economic views that increasing minimum wage led to deadweight loss.\nResearch after Card's and Krueger's work.\nIn 1996, David Neumark and William Wascher reexamined Card and Krueger's results using payroll records from large fast-food chains, reporting that minimum wage increases led to decreases in employment. Their initial findings did not contradict Card and Krueger, but a later version showed a four percent decrease in employment, with statistically significant disemployment effects in some cases. Card and Krueger rebutted these conclusions in a 2000 paper.\nA 2011 paper reconciled differences between datasets, showing positive employment effects for small restaurants but negative effects for large fast-food chains. A 2014 analysis found that minimum wage reduces employment among teenagers.\nA 2010 study using Card and Krueger's methodology supported their original findings, showing no negative effects on low-wage employment.\nA 2011 study by Baskaya and Rubinstein found that federal minimum wage increases negatively impacted employment, particularly among teenagers. Other studies, including a 2012 study by Sabia, Hansen, and Burkhauser, found substantial adverse effects on low-skilled employment, particularly among young workers.\nA 2019 paper in the Quarterly Journal of Economics argued that job losses in studies like those of Meer and West, who found that a minimum wage \"significantly reduces rates of job growth\", are driven by unrealistic assumptions and that minimum wage effects are more complex. Another 2013 study by Fang and Lin found significant adverse effects on employment in China, particularly among women, young adults, and low-skilled workers.\nA 2017 study in Seattle found that increasing the minimum wage to $13 per hour led to reduced income for low-wage workers due to decreased hours worked, as businesses adjusted to higher labor costs. A 2019 study in Arizona suggested that smaller minimum wage increases might lead to slight economic growth without significantly distorting labor markets.\nIn 2019, economists from Georgia Tech found that minimum wage increases could harm small businesses by increasing bankruptcy rates and reducing hiring, with significant impacts on minority-owned businesses.\nThe Congressional Budget Office's 2019 report on a proposed $15 federal minimum wage predicted modest improvements in take-home pay for those who retained employment but warned of potential job losses, reduced hours, and increased costs of goods and services. Similarly, a 2019 study found that increasing the minimum wage could lead to increased crime among young adults.\nStudies from Denmark and Spain further highlighted that significant minimum wage increases could lead to substantial job losses, particularly among young workers. A 2021 study on Germany's minimum wage found that while wages increased without reducing employment, there were significant structural shifts in the economy, including reduced competition and increased commuting times for workers.\nA 2010 study on the UK minimum wage found that it did not cause immediate price increases but led to faster price rises in sectors with many low-wage workers over the long term. A 2012 UK study (1997\u20132007) found the minimum wage reduced wage inequality and had neutral to positive effects on employment. Another 2012 UK study found no \"spill-over\" effects from the minimum wage on higher-earning brackets. A 2016 US study associated the minimum wage with reduced wage inequality and possible spill-over effects, though these might be due to measurement error.\nMeta-analyses.\nIn 1995, Card and Krueger noted evidence of publication bias in time-series studies on minimum wages, which favored studies showing negative employment effects. A 2005 study by T.D. Stanley confirmed this bias and suggested no clear link between the minimum wage and unemployment. A 2008 meta-analysis by Doucouliagos and Stanley supported Card and Krueger's findings, showing little to no negative association between minimum wages and employment after correcting for publication bias.\nDebate over consequences.\nMinimum wage laws affect workers in most low-paid fields of employment and have usually been judged against the criterion of reducing poverty. Minimum wage laws receive less support from economists than from the general public. Despite decades of experience and economic research, debates about the costs and benefits of minimum wages continue today.\nVarious groups have great ideological, political, financial, and emotional investments in issues surrounding minimum wage laws. For example, agencies that administer the laws have a vested interest in showing that \"their\" laws do not create unemployment, as do labor unions whose members' finances are protected by minimum wage laws. On the other side of the issue, low-wage employers such as restaurants finance the Employment Policies Institute, which has released numerous studies opposing the minimum wage. The presence of these powerful groups and factors means that the debate on the issue is not always based on dispassionate analysis. Additionally, it is extraordinarily difficult to separate the effects of minimum wage from all the other variables that affect employment.\nStudies have found that minimum wages have the following positive effects:\nStudies have found the following negative effects:\nA widely circulated argument that the minimum wage was ineffective at reducing poverty was provided by George Stigler in 1949:\nIn 2006, the International Labour Organization (ILO) argued that the minimum wage could not be directly linked to unemployment in countries that have suffered job losses. In April 2010, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released a report arguing that countries could alleviate teen unemployment by \"lowering the cost of employing low-skilled youth\" through a sub-minimum training wage. A study of U.S. states showed that businesses' annual and average payrolls grow faster and employment grew at a faster rate in states with a minimum wage. The study showed a correlation, but did not claim to prove causation.\nAlthough strongly opposed by both the business community and the Conservative Party when introduced in the UK in 1999, the Conservatives reversed their opposition in 2000. Accounts differ as to the effects of the minimum wage. The Centre for Economic Performance found no discernible impact on employment levels from the wage increases, while the Low Pay Commission found that employers had reduced their rate of hiring and employee hours employed, and found ways to cause current workers to be more productive (especially service companies). The Institute for the Study of Labor found prices in minimum wage sectors rose faster than other sectors, especially in the four years after its introduction. Neither trade unions nor employer organizations contest the minimum wage, although the latter had especially done so heavily until 1999.\nIn 2014, supporters of minimum wage cited a study that found that job creation within the United States is faster in states that raised their minimum wages. In 2014, supporters of minimum wage cited news organizations who reported the state with the highest minimum-wage garnered more job creation than the rest of the United States.\nIn 2014, in Seattle, Washington, liberal and progressive business owners who had supported the city's new $15 minimum wage said they might hold off on expanding their businesses and thus creating new jobs, due to the uncertain timescale of the wage increase implementation. However, subsequently at least two of the business owners quoted did expand.\nWith regard to the economic effects of introducing minimum wage legislation in Germany in January 2015, recent developments have shown that the feared increase in unemployment has not materialized, however, in some economic sectors and regions of the country, it came to a decline in job opportunities particularly for temporary and part-time workers, and some low-wage jobs have disappeared entirely. Because of this overall positive development, the Deutsche Bundesbank revised its opinion, and ascertained that \"the impact of the introduction of the minimum wage on the total volume of work appears to be very limited in the present business cycle\".\nA 2019 study published in the \"American Journal of Preventive Medicine\" showed that in the United States, those states that have implemented a higher minimum wage saw a decline in the growth of suicide rates. The researchers say that for every one dollar increase, the annual suicide growth rate fell by 1.9%. The study covers all 50 states for the years 2006 to 2016.\nAccording to a 2020 US study, the cost of 10% minimum wage increases for grocery store workers was fully passed through to consumers as 0.4% higher grocery prices. Similarly, a 2021 study that covered 10,000 McDonald's restaurants in the US found that between 2016 and 2020, the cost of 10% minimum wage increases for McDonald's workers were passed through to customers as 1.4% increases in the price of a Big Mac. This results in minimum wage workers getting a lesser increase in their \"real wage\" than in their nominal wage, because any goods and services they purchase made with minimum-wage labor have now increased in cost, analogous to an increase in the sales tax.\nAccording to a 2019 review of the academic literature by Arindrajit Dube, \"overall, the most up to date body of research from US, UK and other developed countries points to a very muted effect of minimum wages on employment, while significantly increasing the earnings of low paid workers.\"\nAccording to a 2021 study \"The Minimum Wage, EITC, and Criminal Recidivism\" a minimum wage increase of $0.50 reduces the probability an ex-incarcerated individual returns to prison within 3 years by 2.15%; these reductions come mainly from recidivism of property and drug crimes.\nSurveys of economists.\nThere used to be agreement among economists that the minimum wage adversely affected employment, but that consensus shifted in the early 1990s due to new research findings. According to one 2021 assessment, \"there is no consensus on the employment effects of the minimum wage\".\nAccording to a 1978 article in the \"American Economic Review\", 90% of the economists surveyed agreed that the minimum wage increases unemployment among low-skilled workers. By 1992 the survey found 79% of economists in agreement with that statement, and by 2000, 46% were in full agreement with the statement and 28% agreed with provisos (74% total). The authors of the 2000 study also reweighted data from a 1990 sample to show that at that time 62% of academic economists agreed with the statement above, while 20% agreed with provisos and 18% disagreed. They state that the reduction on consensus on this question is \"likely\" due to the Card and Krueger research and subsequent debate.\nA similar survey in 2006 by Robert Whaples polled PhD members of the American Economic Association (AEA). Whaples found that 47% respondents wanted the minimum wage eliminated, 38% supported an increase, 14% wanted it kept at the current level, and 1% wanted it decreased. Another survey in 2007 conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center found that 73% of labor economists surveyed in the United States believed 150% of the then-current minimum wage would result in employment losses and 68% believed a mandated minimum wage would cause an increase in hiring of workers with greater skills. 31% felt that no hiring changes would result.\nSurveys of labor economists have found a sharp split on the minimum wage. Fuchs et al. (1998) polled labor economists at the top 40 research universities in the United States on a variety of questions in the summer of 1996. Their 65 respondents were nearly evenly divided when asked if the minimum wage should be increased. They argued that the different policy views were not related to views on whether raising the minimum wage would reduce teen employment (the median economist said there would be a reduction of 1%), but on value differences such as income redistribution. Daniel B. Klein and Stewart Dompe conclude, on the basis of previous surveys, \"the average level of support for the minimum wage is somewhat higher among labor economists than among AEA members.\"\nIn 2007, Klein and Dompe conducted a non-anonymous survey of supporters of the minimum wage who had signed the \"Raise the Minimum Wage\" statement published by the Economic Policy Institute. 95 of the 605 signatories responded. They found that a majority signed on the grounds that it transferred income from employers to workers, or equalized bargaining power between them in the labor market. In addition, a majority considered disemployment to be a moderate potential drawback to the increase they supported.\nIn 2013, a diverse group of 37 economics professors was surveyed on their view of the minimum wage's impact on employment. 34% of respondents agreed with the statement, \"Raising the federal minimum wage to $9 per hour would make it noticeably harder for low-skilled workers to find employment.\" 32% disagreed and the remaining respondents were uncertain or had no opinion on the question. 47% agreed with the statement, \"The distortionary costs of raising the federal minimum wage to $9 per hour and indexing it to inflation are sufficiently small compared with the benefits to low-skilled workers who can find employment that this would be a desirable policy\", while 11% disagreed.\nAlternatives.\nEconomists and other political commentators have proposed alternatives to the minimum wage. They argue that these alternatives may address the issue of poverty better than a minimum wage, as it would benefit a broader population of low wage earners, not cause any unemployment, and distribute the costs widely rather than concentrating it on employers of low wage workers.\nBasic income.\nA basic income (or negative income tax \u2013 NIT) is a system of social security that periodically provides each citizen with a sum of money that is sufficient to live on frugally. Supporters of the basic-income idea argue that recipients of the basic income would have considerably more bargaining power when negotiating a wage with an employer, as there would be no risk of destitution for not taking the employment. As a result, jobseekers could spend more time looking for a more appropriate or satisfying job, or they could wait until a higher-paying job appeared. Alternatively, they could spend more time increasing their skills (via education and training), which would make them more suitable for higher-paying jobs, as well as provide numerous other benefits. Experiments on Basic Income and NIT in Canada and the United States show that people spent more time studying while the program was running.\nProponents argue that a basic income that is based on a broad tax base would be more economically efficient than a minimum wage, as the minimum wage effectively imposes a high marginal tax on employers, causing losses in efficiency.\nGuaranteed minimum income.\nA guaranteed minimum income is another proposed system of social welfare provision. It is similar to a basic income or negative income tax system, except that it is normally conditional and subject to a means test. Some proposals also stipulate a willingness to participate in the labor market, or a willingness to perform community services.\nRefundable tax credit.\nA refundable tax credit is a mechanism whereby the tax system can reduce the tax owed by a household to below zero, and result in a net payment to the taxpayer beyond their own payments into the tax system. Examples of refundable tax credits include the earned income tax credit and the additional child tax credit in the US, and working tax credits and child tax credits in the UK. Such a system is slightly different from a negative income tax, in that the refundable tax credit is usually only paid to households that have earned at least some income. This policy is more targeted against poverty than the minimum wage, because it avoids subsidizing low-income workers who are supported by high-income households (for example, teenagers still living with their parents).\nIn the United States, earned income tax credit rates, also known as EITC or EIC, vary by state\u2014some are refundable while other states do not allow a refundable tax credit. The federal EITC program has been expanded by a number of presidents including Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. In 1986, President Reagan described the EITC as \"the best anti-poverty, the best pro-family, the best job creation measure to come out of Congress.\" The ability of the earned income tax credit to deliver larger monetary benefits to the poor workers than an increase in the minimum wage and at a lower cost to society was documented in a 2007 report by the Congressional Budget Office.\nThe Adam Smith Institute prefers cutting taxes on the poor and middle class instead of raising wages as an alternative to the minimum wage.\nCollective bargaining.\nItaly, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark are developed nations where legislation stipulates no minimum wage. Instead, minimum wage standards in different sectors are set by collective bargaining. Particularly the Scandinavian countries have very high union participation rates.\nWage subsidies.\nSome economists such as Scott Sumner and Edmund Phelps advocate a wage subsidy program. A wage subsidy is a payment made by a government for work people do. It is based either on an hourly basis or by income earned. Wage subsidies lack political support from either major political party in the United States.\nEducation and training.\nProviding education or funding apprenticeships or technical training can provide a bridge for low skilled workers to move into wages above a minimum wage. For example, Germany has adopted a state funded apprenticeship program that combines on-the-job and classroom training. Having more skills makes workers more valuable and more productive, but having a high minimum wage for low-skill jobs reduces the incentive to seek education and training. Moving some workers to higher-paying jobs will decrease the supply of workers willing to accept low-skill jobs, increasing the market wage for those low skilled jobs (assuming a stable labor market). However, in that solution the wage will still not increase above the marginal return for the role and will likely promote automation or business closure.\nBy country.\nArgentina.\nThe minimum wage was introduced in Argentina in 1945, by Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n, when he was Secretary of Labour during the government of Edelmiro Farrell. When Per\u00f3n became president, he added it to the Constitutional Reform of 1949, however, the dictatorship that overthrew his government in 1955 eliminated the constitutional hierarchy the minimum wage that obtained.\nIn 1964, the minimum wage was reincorporated by the Congress in the Law 16.459\nIn the Constitutional reform of 1994, the minimum wage obtained once again constitutional hierarchy.\nThe minimum wage is defined by the National Council for Employment, Productivity and Minimum, Vital and Mobile Wage, which is formed by Union representatives, business entities and the government.\nArmenia.\nThe concept of the national minimum wage emerged in Armenia in 1995. Since then, it has been increasing, on average, every couple of years. The longest unchanged streak of the national minimum wage was between 1999 and 2003, when it was set at 5,000 AMD, and between 2015 and 2019 where it was set at 55,000 AMD. In November 2022, the national minimum wage was subject to the latest increase. It was set at 75,000 AMD.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, the Fair Work Commission (FWC) is responsible for determining and setting a national minimum wage as well as the minimum wages in awards setting wage rates for particular occupations and industries. \"The Fair Work Act 2009\" establishes an Expert panel tasked with providing and maintaining a safety net of a fair minimum wage. The Expert panel is made up of the president of the panel, three full time commission members, and three part time commission members. All members must have experience in workplace relations, economics, social policy or business, industry and commerce and can inform its decision making through commissioning a range of economic and social research.\nThe legislative framework requires that, in setting minimum wages, the Expert Panel is required to take into account the current state of the economy, including inflation, business competitiveness, productivity and employment growth. In addition, the Expert panel must also consider the social goals of the promotion of social inclusion, the standard of living of the low paid, equal remuneration for work of equal or comparable value and reasonable wages for junior employees, employees whose jobs have training requirements and employees with disability. See Fair Work Act 2009 for more information.\nThe Expert panel conducts yearly wage reviews, to determine if the minimum wage needs to be adjusted based on the economy's current and projected performance. The annual minimum wage review decisions in 2016\u201317 found, based on research tendered and submissions to the review, that moderate increases to minimum wages do not inhibit workplace participation or result in disemployment. This position was carried over to the 2017\u201318 and 2018\u201319 decisions and informed the decisions including the 2018\u201319 decision which delivered a minimum wage increase of 3% when the corresponding headline rate of inflation was 1.3%. In the annual minimum wage review decisions of 2019\u201320 and 2020\u201321, the FWC was considerably more constrained in setting minimum wages due to uncertain economic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020\u201321 decision noted the uncertainty of the impact of increases in the minimum wages for youth employment.\nLebanon.\nAfter two years of constant financial meltdown, Lebanon as of 2021 is ranking as one of the 10 countries in the world with the lowest minimum wages because of the collapse of the local pound following the Lebanese financial crisis that started in August 2019.\nThe minimum monthly wage set at LBP 675,000, which valued USD 450 prior to the crisis, is barely reaching USD 30 nowadays. The currency has lost nearly 90% of its value and drove three quarters of residents into poverty.\nArticle 44 of the Lebanese Code of Labor states that, \"the minimum pay must be sufficient to meet the essential needs of the wage-earner or salary-earner and his family\", and according to Article 46, \"the minimum pay assessed shall be rectified whenever economic circumstances render such review necessary\".\nRepublic of Ireland.\nThe national minimum wage was introduced in the Republic of Ireland in April 2000. Prior to this, minimum wages were set by industry-specific Joint Labour Committees. However, coverage for workers was low and the agreements were poorly enforced and moreover, those who were covered by agreements received low wages.\nAs of April 2000, the government introduced a national minimum wage of \u20ac5.58 per hour. The minimum wage increased regularly in the period from 2000 to 2007 and reached \u20ac8.65 per hour in July 2007. As the global economic downturn hit the country in 2008, there was no further wage increases until 2016 when the minimum wage was increased to 9.15.\nBefore the 2019, there existed specific categories of employees that earned sub-minimum wage rates, expressed as a percentage of the full rate of pay. Employees under the age of 18 were eligible to earn 70 per cent of the minimum wage, employees in the first year of employment were eligible to earn 80 per cent, employees in the second year of full employment were eligible to earn 90 per cent and employees in structured training during working hours were eligible to earn 75, 80 or 90 per cent depending on their level of progression. This framework has since been abolished in place of a framework based on the age of the employee.\nAs of 1 January 2022, the minimum wage is \u20ac10.50. Those aged 20 and over are eligible to receive 100 percent of the minimum wage. Those under the age of 18 are eligible to receive 70 percent of the minimum wage, those aged 18 are eligible to receive 80 percent of the minimum wage and those aged 19 are eligible receive 90 percent of the minimum wage.\nSpain.\nThe Spanish government sets the \"Interprofessional Minimum Wage\" (SMI) annually, after consulting with the most representative trade unions and business associations, for both permanent and temporary workers, as well as for domestic employees. It takes into account the consumer price index, national average productivity, the increase in labor's share in national income, and the general economic situation.\nThe SMI can be revised semi-annually if the government's predictions about the consumer price index are not met. The amount set is a minimum wage, so it can be exceeded by a collective agreement or individual agreement with the company. The revision of the SMI does not affect the structure or amount of professional salaries being paid to workers when they are superior to the established minimum wage. Finally, the amount of the SMI is non-seizable.\nThe minimum wage was introduced in Spain in 1963 through Decree https://, proposed by Jes\u00fas Romeo Gorr\u00eda, the Minister of Labor during Francisco Franco's IX Government. The purpose was to ensure fair remuneration for all workers, adjusting wages to labor and economic conditions and advocating for salary equity. It was set at 1,800 pesetas/month (25,200 pesetas/year, 12 monthly payments plus 2 extra payments, as its customary in Spain as to this day), equivalent to 10.80 euros at the time but only 400 euros in today's prices.\nIn the years following Franco's death in 1975, the minimum wage gradually increased, reaching 50.49 euros (8,400 pesetas) that year, which is equivalent to 657.23 euros in today's currency. Over the years, the minimum wage continued to rise, with several revisions along the way. In 2022, the Spanish government set the minimum wage at 33.33 euros per day or 1,000 euros per month, effective from January 1. This represents a 47% increase from the previous minimum wage set in 2018 at 735.90 euros.\nThere are several debates around the minimum wage in Spain, which focus on its impact on employment and inflation. While some argue that increasing the minimum wage can be a useful tool to increase the incomes of low-income families and reduce poverty, others have doubts about its effectiveness in achieving these goals.\nFor instance, an analysis conducted by BCE (Central Bank of Spain, by its initials in spanish) in 2019 on the impact of the 2017 increase in the minimum wage showed a negative effect on the probability of maintaining employment among affected workers, which was particularly significant for older workers.\nAdditionally, the 2022 raise of the minimum wage revived the debate about the relationship between inflation and the SMI, with some arguing that the increase in the minimum wage could potentially contribute to inflation. The debate centres on whether it's a useful tool to help maintain the purchasing power of those who retain their jobs, or it's not effective because it adds pressure to the growth of prices and increase the likelihood of inflation becoming entrenched.\nMinimum to median wage ratio.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nSupport\nOpposed"}

{"id": "18866", "revid": "50511056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18866", "title": "Macbeth", "text": "Play by William Shakespeare\nThe Tragedy of Macbeth, often shortened to Macbeth (), is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, estimated to have been first performed in 1606. It dramatises the physically violent and damaging psychological effects of political ambitions and power. It was first published in the Folio of 1623, possibly from a prompt book, and is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy. Scholars believe \"Macbeth\", of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of King James I, contains the most allusions to James, patron of Shakespeare's acting company.\nIn the play, a brave Scottish general named Macbeth receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland. Consumed by his latent ambition and spurred to violence by his wife, Macbeth murders King Duncan and takes the Scottish throne for himself. Then, racked with guilt and paranoia, he commits further murders to protect himself from enmity and suspicion, becoming a tyrannical ruler in the process. The violence perpetrated by the power-hungry couple leads to their insanity and finally to their deaths.\nShakespeare's source for the story is the account of Macbeth, King of Scotland, Macduff, and Duncan in \"Holinshed's Chronicles\" (1587), a history of England, Scotland, and Ireland familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries, although the events in the play differ extensively from the history of the real Macbeth.\nThere was a stage superstition that the name of the play should not be spoken, and that it should instead be called \"The Scottish Play\". The play has attracted some of the most renowned actors to the roles of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth and has been adapted to film, television, opera, novels, comics, and other media.\nPlot.\nAct I.\nAmid thunder and lightning, three witches decide that their next meeting will be with Macbeth, the Thane (Lord) of Glamis. In the following scene, soldiers report to King Duncan of Scotland that his generals Banquo and Macbeth have just defeated a rebellion led by the traitorous Thane of Cawdor, allied with forces from Norway and Ireland. Duncan praises his kinsmen for their bravery and fighting prowess, announcing that the title of Thane of Cawdor shall be transferred to Macbeth.\nWandering on a heath, Macbeth and Banquo are puzzled when the three witches appear, prophetically hailing Macbeth as \"Thane of Glamis\" and \"Thane of Cawdor\", next saying he shall \"be king hereafter\". When Banquo asks of his own fortunes, the witches respond that he will father a line of kings, though he himself will not be one. The witches vanish, and the Thane of Ross arrives, informing Macbeth of his newly bestowed title: Thane of Cawdor. The witches' first prophecy is thus fulfilled, and Macbeth immediately begins to harbour nervous ambitions of becoming king. King Duncan himself soon welcomes and praises Macbeth and Banquo, declaring they will all spend the night at Macbeth's castle in Inverness; also, Duncan's son Malcolm is announced as his official heir. Macbeth sends a letter about the witches ahead to his wife, Lady Macbeth, who is resolute that she and her husband should murder Duncan in order to obtain the crown. When Macbeth arrives in Inverness, she persuades him to kill the king that very night. They plan to get Duncan's two chamber attendants drunk so that they will black out; thus, the next morning they can frame the attendants for the murder.\nAct II.\nThat night, despite his doubts and a number of supernatural omens, including a hallucination of a blood-smeared dagger, Macbeth goes offstage and stabs the sleeping Duncan to death. Returning, he is so shaken that Lady Macbeth finds him still holding the bloody daggers, which she scolds him for, reminding him they must be left on Duncan's sleeping servants. She takes the knives and places them back in Duncan's chamber. When the couple hears knocking at the castle gate, they hurry to bed.\nA drunken porter opens the gate, admitting Macduff (the Thane of Fife) and a nobleman named Lennox: they wish to visit the king. Macbeth, greeting them, leads them to Duncan's chamber. Macduff enters the chamber then returns to the stage, announcing with shock the murder of Duncan. Macbeth and Lennox rush into the chamber where, offstage, Macbeth impulsively kills Duncan's servants to prevent them from professing their innocence. He reappears and confesses to the other nobles that he has killed the servants, but lies that his intentions were to avenge the king's murder. Duncan's two sons flee the country, fearing that they will be killed next. Macduff explains that their flight makes them the main suspects in the king's death, and Macbeth, as Duncan's next of kin, assumes the throne offstage as the new King of Scotland. Banquo remembers the witches' prophecy about how his own descendants would inherit the throne, and he is suspicious that Macbeth might be Duncan's true killer.\nAct III.\nDespite Macbeth's success, he remains uneasy about Banquo's role in the prophecy. Inviting Banquo to a royal banquet, Macbeth discovers that Banquo and his young son Fleance will be riding out that night. Macbeth rapidly arranges to have Banquo and Fleance killed, hiring two men and later adding a third murderer to the plan. During the ambush, the murderers succeed in killing Banquo, but Fleance escapes. Macbeth is furious that an heir of Banquo remains alive.\nAt the banquet, Macbeth has invited his lords and Lady Macbeth to a night of drinking and merriment, though Macduff has refused to come. Banquo's ghost enters and sits in Macbeth's place. Macbeth raves fearfully, startling his guests, as the ghost is visible only to him. The others panic at the sight of Macbeth raging at an empty chair, until a desperate Lady Macbeth lies that her husband is merely afflicted with a harmless lifelong illness. The ghost departs and returns once more, causing the same riotous anger and fear in Macbeth. This time, Lady Macbeth demands that the visitors leave. Elsewhere, Hecate, queen of witchcraft, scolds the three witches for communicating with Macbeth without consulting her. Hecate instructs the witches to next give Macbeth a false sense of safety and overconfidence about his new position. Through verbal irony, Lennox reveals to another lord his suspicions that Macbeth is a murdering tyrant and they discuss how Macduff, refusing to attend Macbeth's banquet, has gone to England to find allies who will help take back the Scottish throne.\nAct IV.\nMacbeth visits the three witches and asks them to reveal the truth of their prophecies to him. They summon horrible apparitions, each of which offers further supernatural pronouncements. First, they conjure an armoured head, which tells him to beware of Macduff (IV.i.72). Second, a bloody child tells him that no one born of a woman will be able to harm him. Thirdly, a crowned child holding a tree states that Macbeth will be safe until Great Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane Hill. Macbeth is relieved because he knows that all his enemies are born of women and a forest cannot possibly travel across the land. However, the witches also conjure a procession of eight crowned kings, the last carrying a mirror that reflects even more kings, and finally the ghost of Banquo pointing to the procession. Macbeth realises nervously that these are all Banquo's descendants who will acquire kingships in numerous countries.\nIn light of the latest prophecies, Macbeth orders the disobedient Macduff's castle seized and sends assassins to slaughter all its inhabitants, including Macduff's wife and young son. Meanwhile, Macduff himself is in England meeting with Prince Malcolm (the elder of King Duncan's sons) to discuss Macbeth's tyrannical regime. Malcolm, who must be cautious for any traps, confesses that he would be a terrible leader if the crown were handed to him, but this is merely a lie to see how Macduff will react. Macduff shows that he is more loyal to Scotland than any particular leader, impressing Malcolm, who now reveals the lie and says Macduff has won his trust. The Thane of Ross arrives to deliver the horrible news to Macduff that his \"castle is surprised, your wife and babes / Savagely slaughter'd\" (IV.iii.204\u2013205). With this news of his family's murders, Macduff is stricken with grief, but he is quickly provoked to vengeance by Malcolm who explains that he has raised an army with the help of the English King Edward. Together, they can defeat Macbeth and take back the Scottish throne.\nAct V.\nAt night, in the royal palace at Dunsinane, a doctor and a gentlewoman discuss Lady Macbeth's sudden frightening habit of sleepwalking. Lady Macbeth enters in a trance, bemoaning the recent murders and trying to wash off imaginary bloodstains from her hands. Her observers marvel at her guilt-ridden confessions. Meanwhile, Prince Malcolm's allied forces plan to join up at Birnam Wood, additionally supported by Macduff and defecting Scottish thanes alarmed by Macbeth's recent barbarities. While encamped in Birnam Wood, Malcolm orders his soldiers to cut down and carry tree boughs to camouflage their numbers.\nAs Macbeth readies for the attack, he receives news that his wife has suddenly died, causing him to deliver a despairing \"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow\" soliloquy (V.v.17\u201328). Still, he is emboldened by the witches' seeming guarantee of his invincibility against any \"man of woman born\", until a servant reports that Malcolm's army is advancing on Dunsinane in the form of moving trees. As the invaders take his castle, Macbeth is confronted by Macduff. Macbeth tells him that he cannot be defeated by \"one of woman born\", but Macduff reveals that he was born by Caesarean section and thus did not have a natural childbirth. In the ensuing duel with Macduff, Macbeth is killed offstage. Macduff reenters with Macbeth's severed head, and Malcolm discusses how order has been restored. He implies that Lady Macbeth's death was a suicide, declares his benevolent intentions for the country, promotes his thanes to earls, and invites all to see him crowned at Scone.\nCharacters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSources for the play.\nShakespeare's source for the story is \"Holinshed's Chronicles\" (1587), a history of England, Scotland, and Ireland familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries. He combines two very similar stories from Holinshed: one about a man named Donwald, and another about Macbeth, an 11th-century Scottish king. Donwald, a \"captain of [a] castle\", finds several of his kinsmen put to death by his king, Duff, for dealing with witches. After being pressured by his wife, he and four of his servants kill the king in his own house. In \"Chronicles\", Macbeth is portrayed as a commander struggling to support the kingdom in the face of King Duncan's ineptitude. He and Banquo meet the three witches, who make exactly the same prophecies as in Shakespeare's version. Macbeth and Banquo then together plot the murder of Duncan, at Lady Macbeth's urging. Macbeth has a long, ten-year reign before eventually being overthrown by Macduff and Malcolm. The parallels between the two versions are clear. However, some scholars think that George Buchanan's \"Rerum Scoticarum Historia\" matches Shakespeare's version more closely. Buchanan's work was available in Latin in Shakespeare's day.\nWhile medieval sources give information about King Macbeth, no medieval account mentions the Weird Sisters, Banquo, or Lady Macbeth, and, with the exception of the last-named, it is probable that none of them actually existed. The characters of Banquo, the Weird Sisters, and Lady Macbeth were first mentioned in 1527 by the Scottish historian Hector Boece in his book \"Historia Gentis Scotorum\" (\"History of the Scottish People\"), who wanted to denigrate Macbeth in order to strengthen the claim of the House of Stuart to the Scottish throne. Boece portrayed Banquo as an ancestor of the Stuart kings of Scotland, adding in a \"prophecy\" that the descendants of Banquo would be the rightful kings of Scotland while the Weird Sisters served to give a picture of King Macbeth as gaining the throne via dark supernatural forces. Macbeth did have a wife, but it is not clear if she was as power-hungry and ambitious as Boece portrayed her, which served his purpose of having even Macbeth realise he lacked a proper claim to the throne, and only took it at the urging of his wife. Holinshed accepted Boece's version of Macbeth's reign at face value and included it in his \"Chronicles\". Shakespeare saw the dramatic possibilities in the story as related by Holinshed, and used it as the basis for the play.\nNo other version of the story has Macbeth kill the king in Macbeth's own castle. Scholars have seen this change of Shakespeare's as adding to the darkness of Macbeth's crime as the worst violation of hospitality. Versions of the story that were common at the time had Duncan being killed in an ambush at Inverness, not in a castle. Shakespeare took the detail of the king being murdered while a guest from the story of Donwald and King Duff.\nShakespeare made another important change. In \"Chronicles\", Banquo is an accomplice in Macbeth's murder of King Duncan and plays an important part in ensuring that Macbeth, not Malcolm, takes the throne in the coup that follows. In Shakespeare's day, Banquo was thought to be an ancestor of the Stuart King James I. (In the 19th century it was established that Banquo is an unhistorical character; the Stuarts are actually descended from a Breton family which migrated to Scotland slightly later than Macbeth's time.) The Banquo portrayed in earlier sources is significantly different from the Banquo created by Shakespeare. Critics have proposed several reasons for this change. First, to portray the king's ancestor as a murderer would have been risky. Other authors of the time who wrote about Banquo, such as Jean de Schelandre in his \"Stuartide\", also changed history by portraying Banquo as a noble man, not a murderer, probably for the same reasons. Second, Shakespeare may have altered Banquo's character simply because there was no dramatic need for another accomplice to the murder; there was, however, a need to give a dramatic contrast to Macbeth\u2014a role which many scholars argue is filled by Banquo.\nOther scholars maintain that a strong argument can be made for associating the tragedy with the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. As presented by Harold Bloom in 2008: \"[S]cholars cite the existence of several topical references in \"Macbeth\" to the events of that year, namely the execution of the Father Henry Garnet for his alleged complicity in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, as referenced in the porter's scene.\" Those arrested for their role in the Gunpowder Plot refused to give direct answers to the questions posed to them by their interrogators, which reflected the influence of the Jesuit practice of equivocation. Shakespeare, by having Macbeth say that demons \"palter...in a double sense\" and \"keep the promise to our ear/And break it to our hope\", confirmed James's belief that equivocation was a \"wicked\" practice, which reflected in turn the \"wickedness\" of the Catholic Church. Garnet had in his possession \"A Treatise on Equivocation\", and in the play the Weird Sisters often engage in equivocation, for instance telling Macbeth that he could never be overthrown until \"Great Birnan wood to high Dunsinane hill/Shall Come\". Macbeth interprets the prophecy as meaning never, but in fact, the Three Sisters refer only to branches of the trees of Great Birnam coming to Dunsinane hill.\nOther texts have been cited as possible sources for the play, such as Montaigne's \"Essays\", Pierre Le Loyer's \"A Treatise of Specters\", and, for some individual sections, the anonymous pamphlet \"Newes from Scotland\" (1591?), William Camden's \"Remains\" \"Concerning Britain\" (1605), and Samuel Daniel's \"The Queenes Arcadia\" (1606). Sandra Clark and Pamela Mason write, \"It is hard to imagine that Shakespeare would not have consulted [\"Newes from Scotland\"], given that it is an account of a plot by Scottish witches against the King, the publication of which James himself commissioned. [\u2026] Shakespeare may also have consulted the King's own \"Daemonologie\" (1597).\" On the other hand, Nicholas Brooke writes that there is \"no evidence at all that Shakespeare made any use\" of the \"Daemonologie\" and \"Newes from Scotland\", and he compares them with certain passages only to \"illustrate common beliefs\".\n\"Macbeth\" has been compared to Shakespeare's \"Antony and Cleopatra.\" As characters, both Antony and Macbeth seek a new world, even at the cost of the old one. Both fight for a throne and have a 'nemesis' to face to achieve that throne. For Antony, the nemesis is Octavius; for Macbeth, it is Banquo. At one point Macbeth even compares himself to Antony, saying \"under Banquo / My Genius is rebuk'd, as it is said / Mark Antony's was by Caesar.\" Lastly, both plays contain powerful and manipulative female figures: Cleopatra and Lady Macbeth.\nDate and text.\n\"Macbeth\" cannot be dated precisely, but it is usually taken to be contemporaneous to the other canonical tragedies: \"Hamlet\", \"Othello\", and \"King Lear\". While some scholars have placed the original writing of the play as early as 1599, most believe that the play is unlikely to have been composed earlier than 1603 as the play is widely seen to celebrate King James' ancestors and the Stuart accession to the throne in 1603 (James believed himself to be descended from Banquo), suggesting that the parade of eight kings\u2014which the witches show Macbeth in a vision in Act IV\u2014is a compliment to King James. Many scholars think the play was written in 1606 in the aftermath of the Gunpowder Plot, citing possible internal allusions to the 1605 plot and its ensuing trials. In fact, there are a great number of allusions and possible pieces of evidence alluding to the Plot, and, for this reason, a great many critics agree that \"Macbeth\" was written in the year 1606. Lady Macbeth's instructions to her husband, \"Look like the innocent flower, but be the serpent under't\" (1.5.74\u201375), may be an allusion to a medal that was struck in 1605 to commemorate King James' escape that depicted a serpent hiding among lilies and roses.\nParticularly, the Porter's speech (2.3.1\u201321) in which he welcomes an \"equivocator\", a farmer, and a tailor to hell (2.3.8\u201313), has been argued to be an allusion to the 28 March 1606 trial and execution on 3 May 1606 of the Jesuit Henry Garnet, who used the alias \"Farmer\", with \"equivocator\" referring to Garnet's defence of \"equivocation\". The porter says that the equivocator \"committed treason enough for God's sake\" (2.3.9\u201310), which specifically connects equivocation and treason and ties it to the Jesuit belief that equivocation was only lawful when used \"for God's sake\", strengthening the allusion to Garnet. The porter goes on to say that the equivocator \"yet could not equivocate to heaven\" (2.3.10\u201311), echoing grim jokes that were current on the eve of Garnet's execution: i.e. that Garnet would be \"hanged without equivocation\" and at his execution he was asked \"not to equivocate with his last breath\". The \"English tailor\" the porter admits to hell (2.3.13), has been seen as an allusion to Hugh Griffin, a tailor who was questioned by the Archbishop of Canterbury on 27 November and 3 December 1607 for the part he played in Garnet's \"miraculous straw\", an infamous head of straw that was stained with Garnet's blood that had congealed into a form resembling Garnet's portrait, which was hailed by Catholics as a miracle. The tailor Griffin became notorious and the subject of verses published with his portrait on the title page.\nWhen James became king of England, a feeling of uncertainty settled over the nation. James was a Scottish king and the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, a staunch Catholic and English traitor. In the words of critic Robert Crawford, \"\"Macbeth\" was a play for a post-Elizabethan England facing up to what it might mean to have a Scottish king. England seems comparatively benign, while its northern neighbour is mired in a bloody, monarch-killing past. ... \"Macbeth\" may have been set in medieval Scotland, but it was filled with material of interest to England and England's ruler.\" Critics argue that the content of the play is clearly a message to James, the new Scottish King of England. Likewise, the critic Andrew Hadfield noted the contrast the play draws between the saintly King Edward the Confessor of England who has the power of the royal touch to cure scrofula and whose realm is portrayed as peaceful and prosperous versus the bloody chaos of Scotland. James in his 1598 book \"The Trew Law of Free Monarchies\" had asserted that kings are always right, if not just, and his subjects owe him total loyalty at all times, writing that even if a king is a tyrant, his subjects must never rebel and just endure his tyranny for their own good. James had argued that the tyranny was preferable to the problems caused by rebellion which were even worse; Shakespeare by contrast in \"Macbeth\" argued for the right of the subjects to overthrow a tyrant king, in what appeared to be an implied criticism of James's theories if applied to England. Hadfield also noted a curious aspect of the play in that it implies that primogeniture is the norm in Scotland, but Duncan has to nominate his son Malcolm to be his successor while Macbeth is accepted without protest by the Scottish lords (thanes) as their king despite being an usurper. Hadfield argued this aspect of the play with the thanes apparently choosing their king was a reference to the Stuart claim to the English throne, and the attempts of the English Parliament to block the succession of James's Catholic mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, from succeeding to the English throne. Hadfield argued that Shakespeare implied that James was indeed the rightful king of England, but owed his throne not to divine favour as James would have it, but rather due to the willingness of the English Parliament to accept the Protestant son of the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, as their king.\nGarry Wills provides further evidence that \"Macbeth\" is a Gunpowder Play (a type of play that emerged immediately following the events of the Gunpowder Plot). He points out that every Gunpowder Play contains \"a necromancy scene, regicide attempted or completed, references to equivocation, scenes that test loyalty by use of deceptive language, and a character who sees through plots\u2014along with a vocabulary similar to the Plot in its immediate aftermath (words like \"train, blow, vault\") and an ironic recoil of the Plot upon the Plotters (who fall into the pit they dug).\"\nThe play utilises a few key words that the audience at the time would recognize as allusions to the Plot. In one sermon in 1605, Lancelot Andrewes stated, regarding the failure of the Plotters on God's day, \"Be they fair or foul, glad or sad (as the poet calleth Him) the great Diespiter, 'the Father of days' hath made them both.\" Shakespeare begins the play by using the words \"fair\" and \"foul\" in the first speeches of the witches and Macbeth. In the words of Jonathan Gil Harris, the play expresses the \"horror unleashed by a supposedly loyal subject who seeks to kill a king and the treasonous role of equivocation. The play even echoes certain keywords from the scandal\u2014the 'vault' beneath the House of Parliament in which Guy Fawkes stored thirty kegs of gunpowder and the 'blow' about which one of the conspirators had secretly warned a relative who planned to attend the House of Parliament on 5 November...Even though the Plot is never alluded to directly, its presence is everywhere in the play, like a pervasive odor.\"\nScholars also cite an entertainment seen by King James at Oxford in the summer of 1605 that featured three \"sibyls\" like the weird sisters; Kermode surmises that Shakespeare could have heard about this and alluded to it with the weird sisters. However, A. R. Braunmuller in the New Cambridge edition finds the 1605\u201306 arguments inconclusive, and argues only for an earliest date of 1603.\nOne suggested allusion supporting a date in late 1606 is the first witch's dialogue about a sailor's wife: \"'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries./Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the \"Tiger\"\" (1.3.6\u20137). This has been thought to allude to the \"Tiger\", a ship that returned to England 27 June 1606 after a disastrous voyage in which many of the crew were killed by pirates. A few lines later the witch speaks of the sailor, \"He shall live a man forbid:/Weary se'nnights nine times nine\" (1.3.21\u201322). The real ship was at sea 567 days, the product of 7x9x9, which has been taken as a confirmation of the allusion, which if correct, confirms that the witch scenes were either written or amended later than July 1606.\nThe play is not considered to have been written any later than 1607, since, as Kermode notes, there are \"fairly clear allusions to the play in 1607\". One notable reference is in Francis Beaumont's \"Knight of the Burning Pestle\", first performed in 1607. The following lines (Act V, Scene 1, 24\u201330) are, according to scholars, a clear allusion to the scene in which Banquo's ghost haunts Macbeth at the dinner table:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nWhen thou art at thy table with thy friends,\nMerry in heart, and filled with swelling wine,\nI'll come in midst of all thy pride and mirth,\nInvisible to all men but thyself,\nAnd whisper such a sad tale in thine ear\nShall make thee let the cup fall from thy hand,\nAnd stand as mute and pale as death itself.&lt;/poem&gt;\n\"Macbeth\" was first printed in the First Folio of 1623 and the Folio is the only source for the text. Some scholars contend that the Folio text was abridged and rearranged from an earlier manuscript or prompt book. Often cited as interpolation are stage cues for two songs, whose lyrics are not included in the Folio but are included in Thomas Middleton's play \"The Witch\", which was written between the accepted date for \"Macbeth\" (1606) and the printing of the Folio. Many scholars believe these songs were editorially inserted into the Folio, though whether they were Middleton's songs or preexisting songs is not certain. It is also widely believed that the character of Hecate, as well as some lines of the First Witch (4.1 124\u2013131), were not part of Shakespeare's original play but were added by the Folio editors and possibly written by Middleton, though \"there is no completely objective proof\" of such interpolation.\nThemes and motifs.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Macbeth&lt;br&gt;The Prince of Cumberland!

It is short: more than a thousand lines shorter than \"Othello\" and \"King Lear\", and only slightly more than half as long as \"Hamlet\". This brevity has suggested to many critics that the received version is based on a heavily cut source, perhaps a prompt-book for a particular performance. This would reflect other Shakespeare plays existing in both Quarto and the Folio, where the Quarto versions are usually longer than the Folio versions. \"Macbeth\" was first printed in the First Folio, but has no Quarto version\u00a0\u2013 if there were a Quarto, it would probably be longer than the Folio version. That brevity has also been connected to other unusual features: the fast pace of the first act, which has seemed to be \"stripped for action\"; and the comparative flatness of the characters other than Macbeth. A. C. Bradley, in considering this question, concluded the play \"always was an extremely short one\", noting the witch scenes and battle scenes would have taken up some time in performance, remarking, \"I do not think that, in reading, we \"feel\" \"Macbeth\" to be short: certainly we are astonished when we hear it is about half as long as \"Hamlet\". Perhaps in the Shakespearean theatre too it seemed to occupy a longer time than the clock recorded.\"\nAs a tragedy of character.\nAt least since the days of Samuel Johnson, analysis of the play has centred on the question of Macbeth's ambition, commonly seen as so dominant a trait that it defines the character. Johnson asserted that Macbeth, though esteemed for his military bravery, is wholly reviled by the reader.\nThis opinion recurs in the critical literature, most notably in the work of A. C. Bradley who discusses Macbeth as a character with courage and ambition, but also with the \u201cimagination of a poet\u201d. For Bradley, Macbeth\u2019s imagination is central to his character as he imagines the consequences of his own ambition and imagines the ghosts of his guilt with the \u2018ecstasy of a poet\u2019.\nAdditionally, an emphasis on character exists in the work of Caroline Spurgeon, who highlights the way Shakespeare uses the imagery of clothing to characterize his tragic hero. Spurgeon calls attention to how Macbeth is often described as wearing garments that either seem too big or too small for him, as his ambition is too big and his character too small for his new and unrightful role as king. After Macbeth is unexpectedly greeted with his new title as Thane of Cawdor as prophesied by the witches, Banquo comments:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nAnd, at the end, when the tyrant is at bay at Dunsinane, Caithness sees him as a man trying in vain to fasten a large garment on him with too small a belt:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nwhile Angus sums up what everybody thinks ever since Macbeth's accession to power:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nLike Richard III, but without that character's perversely appealing exuberance, Macbeth wades through blood until his inevitable fall. As Kenneth Muir writes, \"Macbeth has not a predisposition to murder; he has merely an inordinate ambition that makes murder itself seem to be a lesser evil than failure to achieve the crown.\" Some critics, such as E. E. Stoll, explain this characterisation as a holdover from Senecan or medieval tradition. Shakespeare's audience, in this view, expected villains to be wholly bad, and Senecan style, far from prohibiting a villainous protagonist, all but demanded it.\nYet for other critics, it has not been so easy to resolve the question of Macbeth's motivation. Robert Bridges, for instance, perceived a paradox: a character able to express such convincing horror before Duncan's murder would likely be incapable of committing the crime. For many critics, Macbeth's motivations in the first act appear vague and insufficient. John Dover Wilson hypothesised that Shakespeare's original text had an extra scene or scenes where husband and wife discussed their plans. This interpretation is not fully provable; however, the motivating role of ambition for Macbeth is universally recognised. The evil actions motivated by his ambition seem to trap him in a cycle of increasing evil, as Macbeth himself recognises:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nWhile working on Russian translations of Shakespeare's works, Boris Pasternak compared Macbeth to Raskolnikov, the protagonist of \"Crime and Punishment\" by Fyodor Dostoevsky. Pasternak argues that \"neither Macbeth or Raskolnikov is a born criminal or a villain by nature. They are turned into criminals by faulty rationalizations, by deductions from false premises.\" He goes on to argue that Lady Macbeth is \"feminine\u00a0... one of those active, insistent wives\" who becomes her husband's \"executive, more resolute and consistent than he is himself\". According to Pasternak, she is only helping Macbeth carry out his own wishes, to her own detriment.\nAs a tragedy of moral order.\nThe disastrous consequences of Macbeth's ambition are not limited to him. Almost from the moment of the murder, the play depicts Scotland as a land shaken by inversions of the natural order. Shakespeare may have intended a reference to the great chain of being, although the play's images of disorder are mostly not specific enough to support detailed intellectual readings. The play was meant to be performed specifically for King James, whose belief in the divine right of kings suggests that the tragedy of \"Macbeth\" is distinctly moral. The King's own \"Daemonologie\" is believed to have inspired the structure of the witches' coven, making the supernatural world of Macbeth an inversion of the natural kingship, in which he struggles. As in \"Julius Caesar\", though, perturbations in the political sphere are echoed and even amplified by events in the material world. Among the most often depicted of the inversions of the natural order is sleep. Macbeth's announcement that he has \"murdered sleep\" is figuratively mirrored in Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking.\nMacbeth's generally accepted indebtedness to medieval tragedy is often seen as significant in the play's treatment of moral order. Glynne Wickham connects the play, through the Porter, to a mystery play on the harrowing of hell. Howard Felperin argues that the play has a more complex attitude toward \"orthodox Christian tragedy\" than is often admitted; he sees a kinship between the play and the tyrant plays within the medieval liturgical drama.\nSome modern queer readings of \"Macbeth\" are concerned with the play's themes of \"linearity, temporality, and succession,\" rather than transgressive sexuality. Lady Macbeth's request that the spirits she calls on \"unsex\" her is read by Madhavi Menon as indicative of sinthomosexual drive, and queer anti-maternity. The theme of androgyny is often seen as a special aspect of the theme of disorder, with feminist critic Dympna Callaghan arguing that Duncan's corpse stands in for both Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's \"gender indeterminacy\". Macbeth also plays with the inversion of normative gender roles, most famously in the case of the witches (and with Lady Macbeth as she appears in the first act). Whatever Shakespeare's degree of sympathy with such inversions, the play ends with a thorough return to normative gender values. Some feminist psychoanalytic critics, such as Janet Adelman, have connected the play's treatment of gender roles to its larger theme of inverted natural order, as expressed through the \"malignant maternal power\" of the witches and Lady Macbeth. Macbeth is punished for his violation of the moral order by being removed from the cycles of nature (which are figured as female); nature itself (as embodied in the movement of Birnam Wood) is part of the restoration of moral order.\nAs a poetic tragedy.\nCritics in the early twentieth century reacted against what they saw as an excessive dependence on the study of character in criticism of the play. This dependence, though most closely associated with A. C. Bradley, is clear as early as the time of Mary Cowden Clarke, who offered precise, if fanciful, accounts of the predramatic lives of Shakespeare's female leads. She suggested, for instance, that the child Lady Macbeth refers to in the first act died during a foolish military action.\nReacting to what he perceived as a concerning trend among critics to treat Shakespeare's characters as real people, L.C. Knights wrote \"How Many Children Had Lady Macbeth?\" where he argued that \"a Shakespeare play is a dramatic poem\" and that critics should place a greater emphasis on the ways the language works in the play. In the essay he quotes from G. Wilson Knight who similarly argued that \"The persons, ultimately, are not human at all, but purely symbols of a poetic vision.\" Under this analytic lens, Lady Macbeth's invocation of a child she has \"given suck\" interacts with other images of infants in the play, such as the apparitions in Act 4.\nWitchcraft and evil.\nThe three \"weird sisters\" open the play and have been a frequent subject of interpretation. Some, like Peter Stallybrass and Diane Purkiss focus on the historical understanding of witchcraft, and others, like Janet Adelman and Stephen Greenblatt, focus more the psychological or cultural symbolism.\nKing James I, the patron of Shakespeare's theater company The King's Men, had a well documented interest in witchcraft. He believed himself to be the victim of a murder plot involving witchcraft and he wrote a dissertation on witchcraft titled \"Daemonologie\" first published in 1597. It has often been suggested that the King's interest in witchcraft, along with the general popular interest it created, inspired the inclusion of the three witches in the play.\nDiane Purkiss, a historian of witchcraft, has noted that Shakespeare pulled from many different witchcraft traditions, claiming that \"the witches of \"Macbeth\" are a low-budget, frankly exploitative collage of randomly chosen bits of witch-lore, selected not for thematic significance but for its sensation value.\"\nOther critics, like Greenblatt, argue that the witches do have thematic significance. He argues that \"the theater and witchcraft are both constructed on the boundary between fantasy and reality, the border or membrane where the imagination and the corporeal world, figure and actuality, psychic disturbance and objective truth meet.\"\nThe witches introduce ambiguity into the play. They begin the play with phrases like \" When the battle's lost and won\" and end the first scene by saying \"fair is foul and foul is fair/ Hover through the fog and filthy air\" This ambiguity, rooted in paradoxical phrasing and language, can also be viewed as thematic significance. Stephen Orgel argues that the witches \"live outside the social order, but they embody its contradictions: beneath the woman\u2019s exterior is also a man; beneath the man\u2019s exterior is also a woman; nature is full of competing claims, not ordered and hierarchical but deeply anarchic\".\nIn the play, the Three Witches represent darkness, chaos, and conflict, while their role is as agents and witnesses. Their presence communicates treason and impending doom. During Shakespeare's day, witches were seen as worse than rebels, \"the most notorious traytor and rebell that can be\". They were not only political traitors, but spiritual traitors as well. Much of the confusion that springs from them comes from their ability to straddle the play's borders between reality and the supernatural. They are so deeply entrenched in both worlds that it is unclear whether they control fate, or whether they are merely its agents. They defy logic, not being subject to the rules of the real world. The witches' lines in the first act: \"Fair is foul, and foul is fair: Hover through the fog and filthy air\" are often said to set the tone for the rest of the play by establishing a sense of confusion. Indeed, the play is filled with situations where evil is depicted as good, while good is rendered evil. The line \"Double, double toil and trouble,\" communicates the witches' intent clearly: they seek only trouble for the mortals around them. The witches' spells are remarkably similar to the spells of the witch Medusa in Anthony Munday's play \"Fidele and Fortunio\" published in 1584, and Shakespeare may have been influenced by these.\nWhile the witches do not tell Macbeth directly to kill King Duncan, they use a subtle form of temptation when they tell Macbeth that he is destined to be king. By placing this thought in his mind, they effectively guide him on the path to his own destruction. This follows the pattern of temptation used at the time of Shakespeare. First, they argued, a thought is put in a man's mind, then the person may either indulge in the thought or reject it. Macbeth indulges in it, while Banquo rejects it.\nAccording to J. A. Bryant Jr., \"Macbeth\" also makes use of Biblical parallels, notably between King Duncan's murder and the murder of Christ:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No matter how one looks at it, whether as history or as tragedy, \"Macbeth\" is distinctively Christian. One may simply count the Biblical allusions as Richmond Noble has done; one may go further and study the parallels between Shakespeare's story and the Old Testament stories of Saul and Jezebel as Miss Jane H. Jack has done; or one may examine with W. C. Curry the progressive degeneration of Macbeth from the point of view of medieval theology.\nSuperstition and \"The Scottish Play\".\nWhile many today would say that any misfortune surrounding a production is mere coincidence, actors and others in the theatre industry often consider it bad luck to mention \"Macbeth\" by name while inside a theatre, and sometimes refer to it indirectly, for example as \"The Scottish Play\", or \"The Bard's Play\", or when referring to the characters and not the play, \"Mr. and Mrs. M\", or \"The Scottish King\".\nThis behavior results from a superstition that saying the name of the play inside a theatre will bring bad luck to any given production, and perhaps cause physical injury or death to cast members. There are stories of accidents, misfortunes and even deaths taking place during runs of \"Macbeth\".\nThere are many theories for how this superstition began. Some attribute it to real witches, who, unhappy with their representation in the play, cursed the play. There is no historical evidence for this. The origins of the superstition have been traced to a satirical article written by the humorist and theater critic Max Beerbohm. In the article, written from the perspective of Samuel Pepys, he claims that in an early performance of the play the boy actor set to play Lady Macbeth became fatally ill and Shakespeare himself needed to play the part. Since then, the article claimed, \"Macbeth\" has been cursed. Beerbohm's article, though creating a fictional story, was a response to a long history of accidents and set-backs during \"Macbeth\" performances. During 1672 performance of Macbeth in Amsterdam the actor playing Macbeth committed murder on stage. In 1721 riots broke out during a performance in London and in 1937 Lilian Baylis, a theater manager, died the night before a run of \"Macbeth\" began at the Old Vic.\nAccording to the actor Sir Donald Sinden, in his Sky Arts TV series \"Great West End Theatres\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Contrary to popular myth, Shakespeare's tragedy \"Macbeth\" is not the unluckiest play as superstition likes to portray it. Exactly the opposite! The origin of the unfortunate moniker dates back to repertory theatre days when each town and village had at least one theatre to entertain the public. If a play was not doing well, it would invariably get 'pulled' and replaced with a sure-fire audience pleaser\u00a0\u2013 \"Macbeth\" guaranteed full-houses. So when the weekly theatre newspaper, \"The Stage\" was published, listing what was on in each theatre in the country, it was instantly noticed what shows had \"not\" worked the previous week, as they had been replaced by a definite crowd-pleaser. More actors have died during performances of \"Hamlet\" than in the \"Scottish play\" as the profession still calls it. It is forbidden to quote from it backstage as this could cause the current play to collapse and have to be replaced, causing possible unemployment.\nSeveral methods exist to dispel the curse, depending on the actor. One, attributed to Michael York, is to immediately leave the building the stage is in with the person who uttered the name, walk around it three times, spit over their left shoulders, say an obscenity then wait to be invited back into the building. A related practice is to spin around three times as fast as possible on the spot, sometimes accompanied by spitting over their shoulder, and uttering an obscenity. Another popular \"ritual\" is to leave the room, knock three times, be invited in, and then quote a line from \"Hamlet\". Yet another is to recite lines from \"The Merchant of Venice\", thought to be a lucky play.\nPatrick Stewart, on the radio program \"Ask Me Another\", asserted \"if you have played the role of the Scottish thane, then you are allowed to say the title, any time anywhere\".\nPerformance history.\nShakespeare's day to the Interregnum.\nThe only eyewitness account of \"Macbeth\" in Shakespeare's lifetime was recorded by Simon Forman, who saw a performance at the Globe on 20 April 1610. Scholars have noted discrepancies between Forman's account and the play as it appears in the Folio. For example, he makes no mention of the apparition scene, or of Hecate, of the man not of woman born, or of Birnam Wood. However, Clark observes that Forman's accounts were often inaccurate and incomplete (for instance omitting the statue scene from \"The Winter's Tale\") and his interest did not seem to be in \"giving full accounts of the productions\".\nAs mentioned above, the Folio text is thought by some to be an alteration of the original play. This has led to the theory that the play in the Folio was an adaptation for indoor performance at the Blackfriars Theatre (which was operated by the King's Men from 1608)\u00a0\u2013 and even speculation that it represents a specific performance before King James. The play contains more musical cues than any other play in the canon as well as a significant use of sound effects.\nRestoration and eighteenth century.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe chill of the grave seemed about you when you looked on her; there was the hush and damp of the charnel house at midnight ... your flesh crept and your breathing became uneasy ... the scent of blood became palpable to you.\n\u2014Sheridan Knowles on Sarah Siddons' sleepwalking scene\nAll theatres were closed down by the Puritan government on 6 September 1642. Upon the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, two patent companies (the King's Company and the Duke's Company) were established, and the existing theatrical repertoire divided between them. Sir William Davenant, founder of the Duke's Company, adapted Shakespeare's play to the tastes of the new era, and his version would dominate on stage for around eighty years. Among the changes he made were the expansion of the role of the witches, introducing new songs, dances and 'flying', and the expansion of the role of Lady Macduff as a foil to Lady Macbeth. There were, however, performances outside the patent companies: among the evasions of the Duke's Company's monopoly was a puppet version of \"Macbeth\".\n\"Macbeth\" was a favourite of the seventeenth-century diarist Samuel Pepys, who saw the play on 5 November 1664 (\"admirably acted\"), 28 December 1666 (\"most excellently acted\"), ten days later on 7 January 1667 (\"though I saw it lately, yet [it] appears a most excellent play in all respects\"), on 19 April 1667 (\"one of the best plays for a stage ... that ever I saw\"), again on 16 October 1667 (\"was vexed to see Young, who is but a bad actor at best, act Macbeth in the room of Betterton, who, poor man! is sick\"), and again three weeks later on 6 November 1667 (\"[at] \"Macbeth\", which we still like mightily\"), yet again on 12 August 1668 (\"saw \"Macbeth\", to our great content\"), and finally on 21 December 1668, on which date the king and court were also present in the audience.\nThe first professional performances of \"Macbeth\" in North America were probably those of The Hallam Company.\nIn 1744, David Garrick revived the play, abandoning Davenant's version and instead advertising it \"as written by Shakespeare\". In fact this claim was largely false: he retained much of Davenant's more popular business for the witches, and himself wrote a lengthy death speech for Macbeth. And he cut more than 10% of Shakespeare's play, including the drunken porter, the murder of Lady Macduff's son, and Malcolm's testing of Macduff. Hannah Pritchard was his greatest stage partner, having her premiere as his Lady Macbeth in 1747. He would later drop the play from his repertoire upon her retirement from the stage. Mrs. Pritchard was the first actress to achieve acclaim in the role of Lady Macbeth\u00a0\u2013 at least partly due to the removal of Davenant's material, which made irrelevant moral contrasts with Lady Macduff. Garrick's portrayal focused on the inner life of the character, endowing him with an innocence vacillating between good and evil, and betrayed by outside influences. He portrayed a man capable of observing himself, as if a part of him remained untouched by what he had done, the play moulding him into a man of sensibility, rather than him descending into a tyrant.\nJohn Philip Kemble first played Macbeth in 1778. Although usually regarded as the antithesis of Garrick, Kemble nevertheless refined aspects of Garrick's portrayal into his own. However it was the \"towering and majestic\" Sarah Siddons (Kemble's sister) who became a legend in the role of Lady Macbeth. In contrast to Hannah Pritchard's savage, demonic portrayal, Siddons' Lady Macbeth, while terrifying, was nevertheless\u00a0\u2013 in the scenes in which she expresses her regret and remorse\u00a0\u2013 tenderly human. And in portraying her actions as done out of love for her husband, Siddons deflected from him some of the moral responsibility for the play's carnage. Audiences seem to have found the sleepwalking scene particularly mesmerising: Hazlitt said of it that \"all her gestures were involuntary and mechanical ... She glided on and off the stage almost like an apparition.\"\nIn 1794, Kemble dispensed with the ghost of Banquo altogether, allowing the audience to see Macbeth's reaction as his wife and guests see it, and relying upon the fact that the play was so well known that his audience would already be aware that a ghost enters at that point.\nFerdinand Fleck, notable as the first German actor to present Shakespeare's tragic roles in their fullness, played Macbeth at the Berlin National Theatre from 1787. Unlike his English counterparts, he portrayed the character as achieving his stature after the murder of Duncan, growing in presence and confidence: thereby enabling stark contrasts, such as in the banquet scene, which he ended babbling like a child.\nNineteenth century.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEveryone seems to think Mrs McB is a \"Monstrousness\" &amp; \"I\" can only see she's a \"woman\"\u00a0\u2013 a mistaken woman\u00a0\u2013 &amp; \"weak\"\u00a0\u2013 not a Dove\u00a0\u2013 of course not\u00a0\u2013 \"but first of all a wife.\"\n\u2014Ellen Terry\nPerformances outside the patent theatres were instrumental in bringing the monopoly to an end. Robert Elliston, for example, produced a popular adaptation of \"Macbeth\" in 1809 at the Royal Circus described in its publicity as \"this matchless piece of pantomimic and choral performance\", which circumvented the illegality of speaking Shakespeare's words through mimed action, singing, and doggerel verse written by J. C. Cross.\nIn 1809, in an unsuccessful attempt to take Covent Garden upmarket, Kemble installed private boxes, increasing admission prices to pay for the improvements. The inaugural run at the newly renovated theatre was \"Macbeth\", which was disrupted for over two months with cries of \"Old prices!\" and \"No private boxes!\" until Kemble capitulated to the protestors' demands.\nEdmund Kean at Drury Lane gave a psychological portrayal of the central character, with a common touch, but was ultimately unsuccessful in the role. However he did pave the way for the most acclaimed performance of the nineteenth century, that of William Charles Macready. Macready played the role over a 30-year period, firstly at Covent Garden in 1820 and finally in his retirement performance. Although his playing evolved over the years, it was noted throughout for the tension between the idealistic aspects and the weaker, venal aspects of Macbeth's character. His staging was full of spectacle, including several elaborate royal processions.\nIn 1843 the Theatres Regulation Act finally brought the patent companies' monopoly to an end. From that time until the end of the Victorian era, London theatre was dominated by the actor-managers, and the style of presentation was \"pictorial\"\u00a0\u2013 proscenium stages filled with spectacular stage-pictures, often featuring complex scenery, large casts in elaborate costumes, and frequent use of tableaux vivant. Charles Kean (son of Edmund), at London's Princess's Theatre from 1850 to 1859, took an antiquarian view of Shakespeare performance, setting his \"Macbeth\" in a historically accurate eleventh-century Scotland. His leading lady, Ellen Tree, created a sense of the character's inner life: \"The Times\"' critic saying \"The countenance which she assumed ... when luring on Macbeth in his course of crime, was actually appalling in intensity, as if it denoted a hunger after guilt.\" At the same time, special effects were becoming popular: for example in Samuel Phelps' \"Macbeth\" the witches performed behind green gauze, enabling them to appear and disappear using stage lighting.\nIn 1849, rival performances of the play sparked the Astor Place riot in Manhattan. The popular American actor Edwin Forrest, whose Macbeth was said to be like \"the ferocious chief of a barbarous tribe\" played the central role at the Broadway Theatre to popular acclaim, while the \"cerebral and patrician\" English actor Macready, playing the same role at the Astor Place Opera House, suffered constant heckling. The existing enmity between the two men (Forrest had openly hissed Macready at a recent performance of \"Hamlet\" in Britain) was taken up by Forrest's supporters\u00a0\u2013 formed from the working class and lower middle class and anti-British agitators, keen to attack the upper-class pro-British patrons of the Opera House and the colonially minded Macready. Nevertheless, Macready performed the role again three days later to a packed house while an angry mob gathered outside. The militia tasked with controlling the situation fired into the mob. In total, 31 rioters were killed and over 100 injured.\nCharlotte Cushman is unique among nineteenth-century interpreters of Shakespeare in achieving stardom in roles of both genders. Her New York debut was as Lady Macbeth in 1836, and she would later be admired in London in the same role in the mid-1840s. Helen Faucit was considered the embodiment of early-Victorian notions of femininity. But for this reason she largely failed when she eventually played Lady Macbeth in 1864: her serious attempt to embody the coarser aspects of Lady Macbeth's character jarred harshly with her public image. Adelaide Ristori, the great Italian actress, brought her Lady Macbeth to London in 1863 in Italian, and again in 1873 in an English translation cut in such a way as to be, in effect, Lady Macbeth's tragedy.\nHenry Irving was the most successful of the late-Victorian actor-managers, but his \"Macbeth\" failed to curry favour with audiences. His desire for psychological credibility reduced certain aspects of the role: He described Macbeth as a brave soldier but a moral coward, and played him untroubled by conscience\u00a0\u2013 clearly already contemplating the murder of Duncan before his encounter with the witches. Irving's leading lady was Ellen Terry, but her Lady Macbeth was unsuccessful with the public, for whom a century of performances influenced by Sarah Siddons had created expectations at odds with Terry's conception of the role.\nLate nineteenth-century European Macbeths aimed for heroic stature, but at the expense of subtlety: Tommaso Salvini in Italy and Adalbert Matkowsky in Germany were said to inspire awe, but elicited little pity.\n20th century to present.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAnd then Lady Macbeth says 'He that's coming / Must be provided for.' It's an amazing line. She's going to play hostess to Duncan at Dunsinane, and 'provide' is what gracious hostesses always do. It's a wonder of a line to play because the reverberations do the acting for you, make the audience go \"Aaaagh!\"\n\u2014Sin\u00e9ad Cusack\nTwo developments changed the nature of \"Macbeth\" performance in the 20th century: first, developments in the craft of acting itself, especially the ideas of Stanislavski and Brecht; and second, the rise of the dictator as a political icon. The latter has not always assisted the performance: it is difficult to sympathise with a Macbeth based on Hitler, Stalin, or Idi Amin.\nBarry Jackson, at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in 1923, was the first of the 20th-century directors to costume \"Macbeth\" in modern dress.\nIn 1936, a decade before his film adaptation of the play, Orson Welles directed \"Macbeth\" for the Negro Theatre Unit of the Federal Theatre Project at the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem, using black actors and setting the action in Haiti: with drums and Voodoo rites to establish the Witches scenes. The production, dubbed \"The Voodoo Macbeth\", proved inflammatory in the aftermath of the Harlem riots, accused of making fun of black culture and as \"a campaign to burlesque negroes\" until Welles persuaded crowds that his use of black actors and voodoo made important cultural statements.\nA performance which is frequently referenced as an example of the play's curse was the outdoor production directed by Burgess Meredith in 1953 in the British colony of Bermuda, starring Charlton Heston. Using the imposing spectacle of Fort St. Catherine as a key element of the set, the production was plagued by a host of mishaps, including Charlton Heston being burned when his tights caught fire.\nSome critics contend there were three great Macbeths on the English-speaking stage in the 20th century, all of them commencing at Stratford-upon-Avon: Laurence Olivier in 1955, Ian McKellen in 1976 and Antony Sher in 1999. Olivier's portrayal (directed by Glen Byam Shaw, with Vivien Leigh as Lady Macbeth) was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. Kenneth Tynan said it succeeded because Olivier built the role to a climax at the end of the play, whereas most actors spend all they have in the first two acts.\nThe play caused difficulties for the Royal Shakespeare Company, especially at the (then) Shakespeare Memorial Theatre. Peter Hall's 1967 production was (in Michael Billington's words) \"an acknowledged disaster\" with the use of real leaves from Birnham Wood getting first-night laughs, and Trevor Nunn's 1974 production was (Billington again) \"an over-elaborate religious spectacle\".\nBut Nunn achieved success for the RSC in his 1976 production at the intimate Other Place, with Ian McKellen and Judi Dench in the central roles. A small cast worked within a simple circle, and McKellen's Macbeth had nothing noble or likeable about him, being a manipulator in a world of manipulative characters. They were a young couple, physically passionate, \"not monsters but recognisable human beings\", but their relationship atrophied as the action progressed.\nThe RSC again achieved critical success in Gregory Doran's 1999 production at The Swan, with Antony Sher and Harriet Walter in the central roles, once again demonstrating the suitability of the play for smaller venues. Doran's witches spoke their lines to a theatre in absolute darkness, and the opening visual image was the entrance of Macbeth and Banquo in the berets and fatigues of modern warfare, carried on the shoulders of triumphant troops. In contrast to Nunn, Doran presented a world in which king Duncan and his soldiers were ultimately benign and honest, heightening the deviance of Macbeth (who seems genuinely surprised by the witches' prophecies) and Lady Macbeth in plotting to kill the king. The play said little about politics, instead powerfully presenting its central characters' psychological collapse.\n\"Macbeth\" returned to the RSC in 2018, when Christopher Eccleston played the title role, with Niamh Cusack as his wife, Lady Macbeth. The play later transferred to the Barbican in London.\nIn Soviet-controlled Prague in 1977, faced with the illegality of working in theatres, Pavel Kohout adapted \"Macbeth\" into a 75-minute abridgement for five actors, suitable for \"bringing a show in a suitcase to people's homes\".\nSpectacle was unfashionable in Western theatre throughout the 20th century. In East Asia, however, spectacular productions have achieved great success, including Yukio Ninagawa's 1980 production with Masane Tsukayama as Macbeth, set in the 16th century Japanese Civil War. The same director's tour of London in 1987 was widely praised by critics, even though (like most of their audience) they were unable to understand the significance of Macbeth's gestures, the huge Buddhist altar dominating the set, or the petals falling from the cherry trees.\nXu Xiaozhong's 1980 Central Academy of Drama production in Beijing made every effort to be unpolitical (necessary in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution): yet audiences still perceived correspondences between the central character (whom the director had actually modelled on Louis Napoleon) and Mao Zedong. Shakespeare has often been adapted to indigenous theatre traditions, for example the \"Kunju Macbeth\" of Huang Zuolin performed at the inaugural Chinese Shakespeare Festival of 1986. Similarly, B. V. Karanth's \"Barnam Vana\" of 1979 had adapted \"Macbeth\" to the Yakshagana tradition of Karnataka, India. In 1997, Lokendra Arambam created \"Stage of Blood\", merging a range of martial arts, dance and gymnastic styles from Manipur, performed in Imphal and in England. The stage was literally a raft on a lake.\n\"Throne of Blood\" (\u8718\u86db\u5de3\u57ce Kumonosu-j\u014d, \"Spider Web Castle\") is a 1957 Japanese samurai film co-written and directed by Akira Kurosawa. The film transposes \"Macbeth\" from Medieval Scotland to feudal Japan, with stylistic elements drawn from Noh drama. Kurosawa was a fan of the play and planned his own adaptation for several years, postponing it after learning of Orson Welles' \"Macbeth\" (1948). The film won two Mainichi Film Awards.\nThe play has been translated and performed in various languages in different parts of the world, and \"Media Artists\" was the first to stage its Punjabi adaptation in India. The adaptation by Balram and the play directed by Samuel John have been universally acknowledged as a milestone in Punjabi theatre. The unique attempt involved trained theatre experts and the actors taken from a rural background in Punjab. Punjabi folk music imbued the play with the native ethos as the Scottish setting of Shakespeare's play was transposed into a Punjabi milieu.\nIn 2021, Saoirse Ronan starred in \"The Tragedy of Macbeth\" at the Almeida Theatre in London. The following year a revival production opened on Broadway with Daniel Craig and Ruth Negga to middling reviews.\nA new production starring David Tennant and Cush Jumbo ran at London's Donmar Warehouse from 8 December 2023 to 10 February 2024. Max Webster directed the production. The show received 3 Laurence Olivier Award nominations, including Best Revival. It transferred to the Harold Pinter Theatre in the West End from 1 October 2024 for a limited run.\nOperas.\n\"Macbeth\" was adapted into an Italian opera (\"Macbeth\") by composer Giuseppe Verdi and librettist Francesco Maria Piave in 1847 (revised in French in 1865). An English opera adaptation of the play was created by Lawrance Collingwood in 1927.\nContemporary opera adaptations include Luke Styles' \"Macbeth\" (2015) and Pascal Dusapin's \"Macbeth Underworld\" (2019).\nAn indirect adaptation is Dmitri Shostakovich's \"Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk\" (1934), based on the novella of the same name by Nikolai Leskov.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAll references to \"Macbeth\", unless otherwise specified, are taken from the Arden Shakespeare, second series edition edited by Kenneth Muir.

{"id": "18870", "revid": "29419865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18870", "title": "Minor Threat", "text": "American hardcore punk band\nMinor Threat was an American hardcore punk band, formed in 1980 in Washington, D.C., by vocalist Ian MacKaye and drummer Jeff Nelson. MacKaye and Nelson had played in several other bands together, and recruited bassist Brian Baker and guitarist Lyle Preslar to form Minor Threat. They added a fifth member, Steve Hansgen, in 1982, playing bass, while Baker switched to second guitar.\nThe band was relatively short-lived, disbanding after only three years together, but had a strong influence in the emerging American hardcore punk scene, both stylistically and in helping to further establish the \"do it yourself\" ethic for music distribution and concert promotion. Minor Threat's song \"Straight Edge\" was the basis of the straight edge movement, which emphasized a lifestyle without alcohol or other drugs, or promiscuous sex. AllMusic said the band's music was \"iconic\" and noted that it \"ha[d] held up better than [that of] most of their contemporaries.\"\nAlong with the fellow Washington, D.C. hardcore band Bad Brains and California band Black Flag, Minor Threat set the standard for many hardcore punk bands in the 1980s and 1990s. All of Minor Threat's recordings were released on MacKaye's and Nelson's own label, Dischord Records. The \"Minor Threat\" EP and \"Out of Step\" EP have received a number of accolades and are cited as landmarks of the hardcore punk genre.\nHistory.\nFormation and early years.\nPrior to forming Minor Threat in 1980, vocalist Ian MacKaye and drummer Jeff Nelson had played bass and drums respectively in the Teen Idles while attending what was then Wilson High School. During their two-year career within the flourishing Washington, D.C. hardcore punk scene, the Teen Idles had gained a following of around one hundred fans (a sizable amount at the time), and were seen as only second within the scene to the contemporary Bad Brains. MacKaye and Nelson were strong believers in the DIY mentality and an independent, underground music scene. After the breakup of the Teen Idles, they used the money earned through the band to create Dischord Records, an independent record label that would host the releases of the Teen Idles, Minor Threat, and numerous other D.C. punk bands.\nEager to start a new band after the Teen Idles, MacKaye and Nelson recruited guitarist Lyle Preslar and bassist Brian Baker. They played their first performance in December 1980 to fifty people in a basement, opening for Bad Brains, The Untouchables, Black Market Baby and S.O.A., all D.C. bands.\nThe band's first 7-inch EPs, \"Minor Threat\" and \"In My Eyes\", were released in 1981. The group became popular regionally and toured the east coast and Midwest.\n\"Straight Edge,\" a song from the band's first EP, helped to inspire the straight edge movement. The lyrics of the song relay MacKaye's first-person perspective of his personal choice of abstinence from alcohol and other drugs, contrary to most rock musicians at the time. Although the original song was not written as a manifesto or a \"set of rules,\" according to the band members, many later bands inspired by the idea used it as such. Minor Threat band members stated they never intended or viewed \"Straight Edge\" as a \"movement\".\n\"Out of Step\", a Minor Threat song from their second EP, further demonstrates the said belief: \"Don't smoke/Don't drink/Don't fuck/At least I can fucking think/I can't keep up/I'm out of step with the world.\" The \"I\" in the lyrics was usually only implied, mainly because it did not quite fit the rhythm of the song. Some of the other members of Minor Threat, Jeff Nelson in particular, took exception to what they saw as MacKaye's imperious attitude on the song. The line \"Don't fuck\" sparked widespread debate, to which Ian clarified that the intent was commentary on society's attitude towards predatory or casual sex, not on the act itself.\nMinor Threat's song \"Guilty of Being White\" led some critics to accuse the band of racism, but MacKaye has strongly denied such intentions and said that some listeners misinterpreted his words. He claims that his experiences attending Wilson High School, whose student population was 70 percent Black, inspired the song. There, many students bullied MacKaye and his friends. In an interview, MacKaye stated that he was offended that some perceived racist overtones in the lyrics, saying, \"To me, at the time and now, it seemed clear it's an anti-racist song. Of course, it didn't occur to me at the time I wrote it that anybody outside of my twenty or thirty friends who I was singing to would ever have to actually ponder the lyrics or even consider them.\" Thrash metal band Slayer later covered the song, with the last iteration of the lyric \"guilty of being white\" changed to \"guilty of being right.\"\nHiatus.\nIn the time between the release of the band's second seven-inch EP and the \"Out of Step\" record, the band briefly split when guitarist Lyle Preslar moved to Illinois to attend college for a semester at Northwestern University. Preslar was a member of Big Black for a few tempestuous rehearsals. During that period, MacKaye and Nelson put together a studio-only project called Skewbald/Grand Union; in a reflection of the slowly increasing disagreements between the two musicians, they were unable to decide on one name. The group recorded three untitled songs, which would be released posthumously as Dischord's 50th release. During Minor Threat's inactive period, Brian Baker also briefly played guitar for Government Issue and appeared on the \"Make an Effort\" EP.\nIn March 1982, at the urging of Bad Brains' H.R., Preslar left college to reform Minor Threat. The reunited band featured an expanded lineup: Steve Hansgen joined as the band's bassist and Baker switched to second guitar.\nWhen the \"Out of Step\" was re-recorded for the LP \"Out of Step,\" MacKaye clearly sang \"I don't drink/smoke/fuck\", as was the intent of his words all along, in response to what many saw as his imperious attitude on the song. The band also inserted an overdubbed spoken section into the instrumental break before the last chorus with MacKaye stating, \"This is not a set of rules, I'm not telling you what to do...\" Recording engineer Don Zientara had inadvertently recorded an argument between drummer Nelson and lyricist/singer MacKaye that captured the message perfectly, so this was used. According to Mark Andersen and Mark Jenkins' \"Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital\", this argument was over exactly what would be said in the message that Nelson wanted MacKaye to record, stating essentially what he said without knowing it was being recorded.\nBreakup.\nMinor Threat split up in 1983. Creative differences were the main factor in the breakup, Preslar and Baker having become fans of the band U2 and wanting Minor Threat to pursue a similar musical direction. According to Baker:Did we all want to develop Minor Threat\u2019s sound to be more melodic, but Ian MacKaye didn't? Yes, Ian was right, and we were wrong. What Ian was doing was not just a band, Ian was building a community. He was so far ahead of his time and was thinking about the idea of Dischord and several bands and having this kind of reciprocating relationship with other artists. He was so big picture. But I was like: 'I want to play bigger shows, I want to tour more. Minor Threat is a great little punk band, but have you heard the \"Boy\" album\u2026?'\u00a0I was dumb! And he wasn't. So Minor Threat fortunately stopped exactly when it did.MacKaye was skipping rehearsal sessions towards the end of the band's career, and he wrote the lyrics to the songs on the \"Salad Days\" EP in the studio. That was quite a contrast with the earlier recordings, as he had written and co-written the music for much of the band's early material. Minor Threat, which had returned to being a four-piece group with the departure of Hansgen, played its final show on September 23, 1983, at the Lansburgh Cultural Center in Washington, D.C., sharing the bill with go-go band Trouble Funk, and Austin, Texas punk funk act the Big Boys. In a meaningful way, Minor Threat ended their final set with \"Last Song\", a tune whose name was also the original title of the band's song \"Salad Days\".\nFollowing the breakup, MacKaye stated that he did not \"check out\" on hardcore, but in fact hardcore \"checked out\". Explaining this, he stated that at a 1984 Minutemen show, a fan struck MacKaye's younger brother Alec in the face, and he punched the fan back, then realizing that the violence was \"stupid,\" and that he saw his role in the stupidity. MacKaye claimed that immediately after this he decided to leave the hardcore scene.\nSubsequent activities.\nIn March 1984, six months after the band broke up, the EPs \"Minor Threat\" and \"In My Eyes\" were compiled together and re-released as the \"Minor Threat\" album. The \"Complete Discography\" archival compilation would follow in 1989, with the additional release of \"First Demo Tape\" in 2003. Two previously unreleased songs were featured on the \"20 Years of Dischord\" compilation in 2002.\nMacKaye went on to found Embrace with former members of the Faith, Egg Hunt with Jeff Nelson, and later Fugazi, the Evens, and Coriky, as well as collaborating on Pailhead.\nBaker went on to play in Junkyard, the Meatmen, Dag Nasty and Government Issue. Since 1994, Baker has been a member of Bad Religion.\nPreslar was briefly a member of Glenn Danzig's Samhain, and his playing appears on a few songs on the band's first record. He joined The Meatmen in 1984, along with fellow Minor Threat member Brian Baker. He later ran Caroline Records, signing and working with (among others) Peter Gabriel, Ben Folds, Chemical Brothers, and Idaho, and ran marketing for Sire Records. He graduated from Rutgers University School of Law and lives in New Jersey.\nNelson played less-frantic alternative rock with Three and The High-Back Chairs before retiring from live performance. He runs the record label Adult Swim Records (distributed by Dischord) and Pedestrian Press, as well as being a political activist. He resides in Toledo, Ohio. \nThe band's own Dischord Records released material by many bands from the Washington, D.C., area, such as Government Issue, Void, Scream, Fugazi, Artificial Peace, Rites of Spring, Gray Matter, and Dag Nasty, and became a respected independent record label.\nHansgen formed Second Wind with Rich Moore, a former Minor Threat roadie and drummer for the Untouchables. In 1992, he worked as a producer on the first Tool EP \"Opiate\".\nCopyright issues.\n\"Major Threat\".\nIn 2005, a mock-up of the cover of Minor Threat's first EP (also used on the \"Minor Threat\" LP and \"Complete Discography\" CD) was copied by athletic footwear manufacturer Nike for use on a promotional poster for a skateboarding tour called \"Major Threat\". Nike also altered Minor Threat's logo (designed by Jeff Nelson) for the same campaign, as well as featuring Nike shoes in the new picture, rather than the combat boots worn by Ian MacKaye's younger brother Alec on the original.\nMacKaye issued a press statement condemning Nike's actions and said that he would discuss legal options with the other members of the band. Meanwhile, fans, at the encouragement of Dischord, organized a letter-writing campaign protesting Nike's infringement. On June 27, 2005, Nike issued a statement apologizing to Minor Threat, Dischord Records, and their fans for the \"Major Threat\" campaign and said that all promotional artwork (print and digital) that they could acquire was destroyed.\n\"Salad Days\".\nOn October 29, 2005, Fox played the first few seconds of Minor Threat's \"Salad Days\" during an NFL broadcast. Use of the song was not cleared by Dischord Records or any of the members of Minor Threat. Fox claimed that the clip was too short to have violated any copyrights.\nWheelhouse Pickles.\nIn 2007, Brooklyn-based company Wheelhouse Pickles marketed a pepper sauce named \"Minor Threat Sauce\". Requesting only that the original label design (which was based on the \"Bottled Violence\" artwork) be amended, Ian MacKaye gave the product his endorsement. A small mention of this was made, where MacKaye commented, \"I don't have an occasion to eat a lot of hot sauce, but I also thought the Minor Threat stuff was nice.\"\nUrban Outfitters.\nIn 2013, Minor Threat shirts began appearing in Urban Outfitters stores. Ian MacKaye confirmed that the shirts were officially licensed. Having spent what he described as \"a complete waste of time\" trying to track down bootlegged Minor Threat merchandise, MacKaye and Dischord made arrangements with a merchandise company in California to manage licensing of the band's shirts, as well as working to ensure that bootleg manufacturers of the shirts were curtailed. In comments that appeared in \"Rolling Stone\", MacKaye called it \"absurd\" for the shirts to be sold for $28 but concluded that \"my time is better spent doing other things\" than dealing with shirts. Dischord had previously taken action against Forever 21 in 2009 for marketing unlicensed Minor Threat shirts.\nMusical style and legacy.\nMinor Threat are considered to be one of the most influential punk rock bands of the 1980s. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic conferred the title of \"the definitive Washington, D.C., hardcore punk band\" on the group, crediting them for \"setting the style for the straight-edge punk movement of the early '80s.\" In the book \"Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo\", music critic Andy Greenwald wrote\",\" \"Minor Threat found artistry in economy, pumping the bottomless teenaged well of rage \u2212 against the establishment, against the cops, against apathy and each other \u2212 to fuel blistering, ferociously short sharp sonic shocks in the form of songs. The beats were monochromatic and the instruments were raced as fast as they could possibly go \u2212 the goal was catharsis through the passionate expenditure of energy.\" Many of the band's songs were brief in duration, with most clocking in at approximately one minute in length.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Examples include thoughts, feelings, decisions, dreams, and realizations. These events often make up the conscious life that are associated with cognitive function.\nSome believe that mental events are not limited to human thought but can be associated with animals and artificial intelligence as well. Whether mental events are identical to complex physical events, or whether such an identity even makes sense, is central to the mind\u2013body problem.\nRelation to mind\u2013body problem.\nSome state that the mental and the physical are the very same property which cause any event(s). This view is known as substance monism. An opposing view is substance dualism, which claims that the mental and physical are fundamentally different and can exist independently. A third approach is Donald Davidson's \"anomalous monism\". The Philosophy of Action states that every action is caused by prior thoughts or feelings, and understanding those mental events would in turn explain behavior.\nPhysicalism, a form of substance monism, states that everything that exists is either physical or depends on that which is physical. The existence of mental events has been used by philosophers as an argument against physicalism. For example, in his 1974 paper \"What Is it Like to Be a Bat?\", Thomas Nagel argues that physicalist theories of mind cannot explain an organism's subjective experience because they cannot account for its mental events.\nEpiphenomenalism, according to Stanford, \"Is the view that mental events are caused by physical events in the brain, but have no effect upon any physical events.\" This stance then brings up the idea of introspection. According to David Lieberman, introspection is the ability for a person to observe his or her own mental state or events. Mental events can happen consciously and subconsciously at any given point. All mental events take place due to external stimuli. Which then must be processed via working memory.\nMental Events and Working Memory.\nMental events must occur in the working memory of short term-store. Both working memory and short-term memory are essential to mental events and cognition. According to Lieberman (2021), Baddeley and Hitch (1974) proposed that working memory consists of three distinct subsystems: what are called a phonological loop, a visuo-spatial sketchpad, and central executive. \nThe phenological loop is responsible for holding speech-based sounds while the visuo-spatial sketchpad holds visual concepts in the mind. Both work independent of each other. Whereas the central executive is responsible for controlling both systems. The central executive is also responsible for aiding in tasks such as reasoning and understanding language. \nIn order for mental events to occur, in Homo sapiens, situations and events must be processed through working memory in order to be perceived as a mental event. Without this system of memory, situations cannot be stored as mental events. All thoughts, feelings, decisions, dreams, and realizations must cycle through this process indefinitely.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
