He was the leading American bridge personality in the 1950s and 1960s and widely known as \"Mr. Bridge\". \nEarly years.\nGoren was born in what is now Khotyn, Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire, to a Jewish family. His parents were Jacob and Rebecca Goron, a writer and a homemaker. His father emigrated in 1903 with the family possibly coming later. He earned a law degree at McGill University in Montreal in 1923. While he was attending McGill, a girlfriend (or \"a young hostess\") laughed at his ineptness at the game of bridge, thus motivating him to immerse himself in a study of existing bridge materials.\nAfter graduation, he practiced law for 13 years in Philadelphia. The growing fame of contract bridge player Ely Culbertson, however, prompted Goren to abandon his original career choice to pursue bridge competitions, where he attracted the attention of Milton Work, an American authority on many card games including contract bridge. Work was impressed by Goren's knowledge of the game and hired Goren to help him write his bridge articles and columns.\nWork was one of many strong bridge players based in Philadelphia around the 1920s. By 1928 he had popularized the 4\u20133\u20132\u20131 point count system for evaluating balanced hands (now sometimes called the Work count). His chief assistant Olive Peterson and young Goren established a partnership as players.\nAs a player Goren's \"breakthrough\" was the 1937 Board-a-Match Teams championship (now called The Reisinger National Bridge Championship) which he won with three other Philadelphia players: John Crawford, Charles Solomon, and Sally Young.\nGoren dominated the competitive bridge circuit ultimately becoming world champion at the Bermuda Bowl in 1950 and remained a competitive player until about 1962 after which he focused on writing and teaching bridge.\nBridge contributions.\nAfter Milton Work died in 1934, Goren began his own bridge writing career and published the first of his many books on playing bridge, \"Winning Bridge Made Easy\", in 1936. Drawing on his experience with Work's system, Goren quickly became popular as an instructor and lecturer.\nGoren's books have sold millions of copies (especially \"Winning Bridge Made Easy\" and \"Contract Bridge Complete\"); by 1958 his daily bridge column was appearing in 194 American newspapers. He also had a monthly column in \"McCall's\" and a weekly column in \"Sports Illustrated\".\nHis television program, \"Championship Bridge with Charles Goren\", was broadcast from 1959 to 1964 on the ABC network. It featured numerous appearances by top players and segments with celebrity guests such as Chico Marx, Alfred Drake, and Forest Evashevski, among others.\nGoren's longest partnership was with Helen Sobel, but he also famously partnered actor Omar Sharif. Sharif also wrote introductions to or co-authored several of Goren's bridge books, and was also co-author of Goren's newspaper column, eventually taking it over in collaboration with Tannah Hirsch.\nPoint count system.\nAs he continued writing, Goren began to develop his point count system, based on the Milton Work point count, as an improvement over the existing system of counting \"honor tricks\". Goren, with assistance, formulated a method of combining the Work count, which was based entirely on high cards, and various distributional features. This may well have improved the bidding of intermediate players and beginners almost immediately.\nFour-card suits.\nGoren also worked to continue the practice of opening four-card suits, with an occasional three-card club suit when the only four-card suit was a weak major. In this, he was following the practice established by Ely Culbertson in the early 1930s. Later on, he continued this practice, resisting the well-known \"five-card majors\" approach that has become a major feature of modern Standard American bidding.\nOpening a four-card suit can improve the chances of the partnership identifying a four-four trump fit, and the four-card approach is still used by experts today, notably by most Acol players. It is claimed that the drawback of the four-card approach is that the Law of Total Tricks is more difficult to apply in cases where it is used. However, the five-card majors approach became popular before the Law of Total Tricks was propounded.\nOther contributions.\nIn addition to his pioneering work in bringing simple and effective bridge to everyday players, Goren also worked to popularize the Precision bidding method, which is one of many so-called big club or strong club systems (which use an opening bid of one club to indicate a strong hand).\nTribune Content Agency distributes the daily column Goren Bridge, written by Bob Jones, using the Goren method.\nLegacy.\nGoren died on April 3, 1991, in Encino, California, at the age of 90. He had lived with his nephew Marvin Goren for 19 years. While few players \"play Goren\" exactly today, the point-count approach he popularized remains the foundation for most bidding systems.\nDuring the month of Goren's death, Truscott followed his obituary with a bridge column entitled, \"Goren leaves behind many fans and a column with an international flavor\". His business interests had been \"managed by others\" since his retirement \"a quarter of a century ago\", according to Truscott. \"The Goren syndicated column now has an international flavor: It carries the bylines of the movie star Omar Sharif, an Egyptian who lives in Paris, and an entrepreneur, Tannah Hirsch, a South African who came to the United States via Israel.\"\nGoren appeared on the Groucho Marx radio and television game show You Bet Your Life in March 1958.\nGoren appeared on the television game show What\u2019s My Line in December 1961.\n The earliest British edition in WorldCat records is \"Better Bridge for Better Players: the standard book of play\", intro. Culbertson, fwd. Kauffman (London: Walter Edwards, 1947), \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Formerly a mortal man, he is a cosmic entity who consumes planets to sustain his life force, and serves a functional role in the upkeep of the primary Marvel continuity. He was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and first appeared in \"Fantastic Four\" #48 (March 1966). Lee and Kirby wanted to introduce a character that broke from the archetype of the standard villain. In the character's first appearance, Galactus was depicted as a god-like figure that fed by draining living planets of their energy, and operated without regard to the morality or judgments of mortal beings.\nGalactus's initial origin was that of a Taa-an space explorer named Galan who gained cosmic abilities by passing near a star, but writer Mark Gruenwald further developed the character's origins, presenting Taa and Galan as existing in the universe prior to the Big Bang that began the setting of the current universe. As Galan's universe came to an end, he merged with the \"Sentience of the Universe\" to become Galactus, an entity who must consume planets to sustain his existence. Additional material written by John Byrne, Jim Starlin, and Louise Simonson explored Galactus's role and purpose in the Marvel Universe, and examined the character's actions through themes of genocide, manifest destiny, ethics, and natural/necessary existence. Frequently accompanied by a herald (such as the Silver Surfer), the character has appeared as both antagonist and protagonist in central and supporting roles. Since debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, Galactus has played a role in over five decades of Marvel continuity. In 2009, Galactus ranked fifth on IGN's list of \"Top 100 Comic Book Villains\", which cited the character's \"larger-than-life presence\" as making him one of the more important villains ever created. IGN also noted \"Galactus is one of the few villains on our list to really defy the definition of an evil-doer\" as the character is compelled to destroy worlds because of his hunger, rather than out of malicious ends.\nThe character has been featured in other Marvel media, such as arcade games, video games, animated television series, and the 2007 film '. He appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film ' (2025), portrayed by Ralph Ineson.\nPublication history.\nCreated by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist-coplotter Jack Kirby, the character debuted in \"The Fantastic Four\" #48 (cover dated March 1966, the first of a three-issue story later known as \"The Galactus Trilogy\").\nOrigin.\nIn 1966, just a few years after launching Marvel Comics' flagship superhero title \"Fantastic Four\", creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby collaborated on an antagonist designed to break the supervillain mold of the time and instead be a being with god-like stature and power. As Lee recalled in 1993,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Galactus was simply another in a long line of super-villains whom we loved creating. ...[W]e felt the only way to top ourselves was to come up with an evil-doer who had almost godlike powers. Therefore, the natural choice was sort of a demi-god, but now what would we do with him? We didn't want to use the tired old cliche about him wanting to conquer the world. There were enough would-be world conquerors in the Marvel Universe and in all the other comic book galaxies. That was when inspiration struck. Why not have him not be a really evil person? After all, a demi-god should be beyond mere good and evil. He'd just be (don't laugh!) hungry. And the nourishment he'd require is the life force and energy from living planets!\nKirby described his biblical inspirations for Galactus and an accompanying character, an angelic herald Lee called the Silver Surfer:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My inspirations were the fact that I had to make sales and come up with characters that were no longer stereotypes. In other words, I couldn't depend on gangsters. I had to get something new. For some reason, I went to the Bible and I came up with Galactus. And there I was in front of this tremendous figure, who I knew very well because I've always felt him. I certainly couldn't treat him in the same way I could any ordinary mortal. And I remember in my first story, I had to back away from him to resolve that story. The Silver Surfer is, of course, the fallen angel. When Galactus relegated him to Earth, he stayed on Earth, and that was the beginning of his adventures. They were figures that had never been used before in comics. They were above mythic figures. And of course they were the first gods.\nKirby elaborated, \"Galactus in actuality is a sort of god. He is beyond reproach, beyond anyone's opinion. In a way he is kind of a Zeus, who fathered Hercules. He is his own legend, and of course, he and the Silver Surfer are sort of modern legends, and they are designed that way.\"\nWriter Mike Conroy expanded on Lee and Kirby's explanations: \"In five short years from the launch of the \"Fantastic Four\", the Lee/Kirby duo ... had introduced a whole host of alien races or their representatives ... there were the Skrulls, the Watcher and the Stranger, all of whom Lee and Kirby used in the foundations of the universe they were constructing, one where all things were possible but only if they did not flout the 'natural laws' of this cosmology. In the nascent Marvel Universe, characters acted consistently, whatever comic they were appearing in. Their actions reverberated through every title. It was pure soap opera but on a cosmic scale, and Galactus epitomized its epic sweep.\"\nThis led to the introduction of Galactus in \"Fantastic Four\" #48\u201350 (March\u2013May 1966), which fans began calling \"The Galactus Trilogy\". Kirby did not intend Galactus to reappear, to preserve the character's awe-inspiring presence. Fan popularity, however, prompted Lee to ask Kirby for Galactus' reappearance, and the character became a mainstay of the Marvel Universe.\n1960s.\nTo preserve the character's mystique, his next two appearances were nonspeaking cameos in \"Thor\" #134 (November 1966), and \"Daredevil\" #37 (February 1968), respectively. Numerous requests from fans prompted the character to be featured heavily in \"Fantastic Four\" #74\u201377 (May\u2013August 1968). After a flashback appearance in \"Silver Surfer\" #1 (August 1968), the character returned to Earth in \"Thor\" #160\u2013162 (January\u2013March 1969). Galactus' origin was eventually revealed in \"Thor\" #168\u2013169 (September\u2013October 1969).\n1970s and 1980s.\nThe character made appearances in \"Fantastic Four\" #120\u2013123 (March\u2013June 1972) and \"Thor\" #225\u2013228 (July\u2013October 1974). These two storylines introduced two new heralds for Galactus. Galactus also featured in \"Fantastic Four\" #172\u2013175 (July\u2013October 1976) and 208\u2013213 (July\u2013December 1979).\nStan Lee and Jack Kirby reunited for the origin of the Silver Surfer and Galactus in the one-shot graphic novel \"The Silver Surfer: The Ultimate Cosmic Experience!\" in 1978. This Marvel Fireside Book, published by Simon &amp; Schuster, was an out-of-continuity retelling of the origin story without the Fantastic Four.\nThe full Lee-and-Kirby origin story was reprinted in the one-shot \"Super-Villain Classics\" #1: \"Galactus \u2013 The Origin\" (May 1983), inked by Vince Colletta and George Klein, lettered by John Morelli and colored by Andy Yanchus. While nearly identical to the previous origin, this story featured supplemental material, edits, and deletions by writer Mark Gruenwald, pencillers John Byrne and Ron Wilson and inker Jack Abel. Rather than traveling into a dying star, the character enters the core of the collapsing universe before the Big Bang; the story was later reprinted as \"Origin of Galactus\" #1 (February 1996).\nThe character guest-starred in \"Rom\" #26\u201327 (January\u2013February 1982). Galactus featured in two related storylines in \"Fantastic Four\" #242\u2013244 (May\u2013July 1982) and later #257 (August 1983), in which writer-artist John Byrne introduced the conceit of Galactus feeling remorse for his actions, and the weight of his genocides. In the issue, Death assures Galactus of his role and purpose as one of shepherd and weeder in guiding the universe to its proper purpose, and Galactus remains resolute. Byrne further elaborated on this concept in \"Fantastic Four\" #262 (January 1984), which sparked controversy. At the end of the story, Eternity, an abstract entity in the Marvel Universe, appears to validate the existence of Galactus as necessary for the natural order and essential to prevent an even more catastrophic fate; Howard University professor of literature Marc Singer criticized this, accusing the writer-artist of using the character to \"justify planetary-scale genocide.\" Byrne and Stan Lee also collaborated on a one-shot Silver Surfer story (June 1982) in which Galactus returned to Zenn-La after the Surfer's rebellion and drained it of energy after allowing the populace to flee.\nWriter-penciller John Byrne and inker Terry Austin produced \"The Last Galactus Story\" as a serial in the anthology comic-magazine \"Epic Illustrated\" #26\u201334 (October 1984 \u2013 February 1986). Nine of a scheduled 10 installments appeared. Each was six pages with the exception of the eighth installment (12 pages). The magazine was cancelled with issue #34, leaving the last chapter unpublished and the story unfinished; however, Byrne later published the conclusion on his website. Galactus played a pivotal role in the limited series \"Secret Wars\" #1\u201312 (May 1984 \u2013 April 1985), and became a recurring character in \"Silver Surfer\" (vol. 3) (beginning with issue #1 (July 1987)).\nStan Lee and artist John Buscema also produced the 64-page hardcover graphic novel \"Silver Surfer: Judgment Day\" (October 1988), in which Galactus clashes with the demonic entity Mephisto.\n1990s.\nGalactus was featured in the miniseries \"The Infinity Gauntlet\" #1\u20136 (July\u00a0\u2013December 1991), \"The Infinity War\" #1\u20136 (June\u00a0\u2013November 1992) and \"Cosmic Powers\" #1\u20136 (March\u00a0\u2013August 1994). The character starred in the six-issue miniseries \"Galactus the Devourer\" (September 1999\u00a0\u2013March 2000), written by Louise Simonson and illustrated by John Buscema, which climaxed with Galactus' death. Simonson originally conceived that the story arc would occur in \"Silver Surfer\" (vol. 3), but the title was cancelled due to dwindling sales. She proposed a separate limited series, and at the time was initially doubtful that Marvel would approve what she considered a \"radical\" idea concerning \"why the very existence of the universe depends on the health and well-being of Galactus.\"\n2000s.\nThe consequences of Galactus' death are explored in the issues \"Fantastic Four Annual 2001\" and \"Fantastic Four\" (vol. 3) #46\u201349 (October 2001 \u2013 January 2002) written by Jeph Loeb and culminate in Galactus' revival, bringing resolution to Simonson's cliffhanger from the \"Devourer\" story arc. The character features in the first six issues of the limited series \"Thanos\" (December 2003 \u2013 May 2004), written by Jim Starlin. Issues #7\u201312 (June\u2013November 2004), written by Keith Giffen, introduce the , who is retroactively presented as Galactus' first herald.\nGalactus' origin is re-examined in \"Fantastic Four\" #520\u2013523 (October 2004 \u2013 April 2005), in which the character is temporarily reverted to his mortal form. After appearing in the limited series \"Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill\" #1\u20136 (March\u2013August 2005) Galactus was a central character in the \"Annihilation\" storyline, appearing in the limited series ' #1\u20134 (June\u2013September 2006), \"Annihilation\" #1\u20136 (October 2006 \u2013 March 2007) and the epilogue, ' #1\u20132 (February\u2013April 2007).\nGalactus was an antagonist in \"Fantastic Four\" #545\u2013546 (June\u2013July 2007), where he tried to devour fellow cosmic function Epoch. In \"Nova\" (vol. 4) #13\u201315 (May\u2013July 2008), the character had no dialogue. Author Andy Lanning said that he and co-writer Dan Abnett were \"treating Galactus like a force of nature; an inevitable, planetary catastrophe that there is no reasoning with, no bargaining with and no escaping.\" Galactus also appeared in the limited series \"Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter\" #1\u20133 (June\u2013August 2009), a sequel to \"Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill\" #1\u20136.\n2010s.\nGalactus and the Silver Surfer appeared as antagonists in both \"Skaar: Son of Hulk\" #7\u201312 (March 1, 2009 \u2013 August 1, 2009) and \"Son of Hulk\" #13\u201317 (September 1, 2009 \u2013 January 2010), and as protagonists in the miniseries \"The Thanos Imperative\" #1\u20136 (June\u2013November 2010). Galactus was a member of the God Squad in the miniseries \"Chaos War\" #2\u20135 (December 2010 \u2013 March 2011). After an appearance in \"Fantastic Four\" #583\u2013587 (November 2010 \u2013 March 2011), the character returned to Earth in \"Silver Surfer\" (vol. 6) #1\u20135 (January\u2013May 2011) and was the antagonist in \"The Mighty Thor\" #1\u20136 (April\u2013September 2011). Galactus played a supporting role in the storyline \"Forever\" featured in \"Fantastic Four\" #600\u2013604 (November 2011 \u2013 March 2012) and \"FF\" #16 (March 2012) by Johnathan Hickman, where Hickman introduced the concept of a shared destiny between Galactus and Franklin Richards. Writer Mark Waid would subsequently develop this concept further (see below).\nThe character played a central role as antagonist in \"Hunger\" #1\u20134 (2013), in which the mainstream Galactus of the primary Marvel continuity merges with his counterpart from the Ultimate Marvel publication imprint, Gah Lak Tus. Writer Joshua Hale Fialkov commented that his intent was to use Galactus as a means to place the characters from the Ultimate Marvel imprint into a completely unexpected crisis: \"What I hope comes across is the sense of wonder that's being brought into the Ultimate Universe...with the smart, modern tone Brian has established.\"\nFollowing his appearance in \"Hunger\", Galactus was a major supporting character in \"The Ultimates\" (vol. 2) #1\u20136 (January\u2013June 2016), where writer Al Ewing fundamentally changed the nature of Galactus' character. During the events of the story, Galactus is transformed into \"the Lifebringer\", a being who is compelled to infuse dead planets with life-sustaining energies, thus altering the character's primary motive for the first time since Galactus' debut in 1966. Elaborating on what inspired the change, Ewing explained \"What inspired it\u2014a mixture of wanting someone big on or allied with the team\u2014originally, we thought about Odin, but he's a bit busy\u2014and my usual preoccupations with atonement, redemption, growth and change. So what can [Galactus] do now? Well, whereas before he was taking in vast amounts of energy, now he's putting out vast amounts of energy\u2014pure life energy. He always said he was going to give back more than he took out of the universe\u2014now he's making good on that, one dead world at a time.\" The themes of redemption and change were received well by columnist Mark Peters, who described Ewing's work on \"Ultimates\" as \"one of the best Galactus stories ever.\"\nGalactus featured prominently in a direct sequel series to \"The Ultimates\" (vol. 2) #1\u20136 titled \"The Ultimates 2\" (vol. 2) #1\u201310 (November 2016 \u2013 August 2017) which focused on the Lifebringer Galactus as the de facto leader of the Ultimates. Galactus in his Lifebringer persona made his final appearance in \"Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\" #26\u201330 (December 2017 \u2013 April 2018) before being reverted to his \"Devourer of Worlds\" persona by writer Gerry Duggan in \"Infinity Countdown\" #4 (June 2018).\nSet at the end of the primary Marvel continuity, the miniseries \"History of the Marvel Universe\" #1\u20136 (July 2019 \u2013 December 2019) by Mark Waid depicted Galactus as the in-story narrator. The story features Galactus recounting all the major events that have occurred in Marvel continuity to Franklin Richards as the universe experiences its final moments. Confirming the series as occurring within the primary Marvel continuity, Waid elaborated that \"[t]here is a framing device, yes. We wanted it to be a story, not just a long Wikipedia entry. As established in Jonathan Hickman's \"Fantastic Four\" run, there comes a point when Galactus and Franklin Richards stand together at the end of time, and now we get to see exactly what they were doing there.\"\n2020s.\nGalactus was killed by Thor during the \"Herald of Thunder\" story arc in \"Thor\" (vol. 6) #1\u20136 (March\u2013August 2020). Galactus reappeared after a two-year hiatus in \"Fantastic Four\" (vol. 6) #45 (July 2022)\u2014the final issue of the event \"Reckoning War\"\u2014where he is resurrected by his former heralds.\nFictional character biography.\nReality goes through cycles of creation and destruction. Galactus was originally the Taa-an explorer Galan of the planet Taa in the previous iteration of the multiverse, the Sixth Cosmos, which existed before the Big Bang of the current multiverse, the Seventh Cosmos. When an unknown cosmic cataclysm gradually kills all other life in his universe, Galan and other survivors leave Taa on a spacecraft and are engulfed in the Big Crunch. Galan, however, does not die: after bonding with the Sentience of the Universe, he changes and gestates for billions of years in an egg made of the debris of his ship that the current universe formed after the Big Bang. He emerges as Galactus, and although a Watcher named Ecce observed Galactus's birth and recognizes his destructive nature, the Watcher chooses not to kill Galactus. Starving for sustenance, Galactus consumes the nearby planet of Archeopia\u2014the first of many planets he would destroy to maintain his existence. Subsequently, in memory of his dead homeworld of Taa and the first planet (Archeopia) to fall prey to his hunger, Galactus constructs a new \"homeworld\": the M\u00f6bius strip-shaped space station called Taa II.\nGalactus becomes involved in a civil war among the \"Proemial Gods\", who had come into being during the universe's infancy. When a faction of the gods led by Diableri of Chaos attempts to remake the universe in their own image, Galactus kills Diableri and imprisons three others (Antiphon, Tenebrous, and Aegis) in the prison called the Kyln.\nGalactus then creates the being Tyrant out of a desire for companionship, but the two ultimately engage in a major conflict. Galactus decides to empower his first herald\u2014the \u2014who ultimately rebels against his master. When approaching the planet of Zenn-La, Galactus accepts the offer of Norrin Radd to become his herald, the Silver Surfer, in exchange for sparing his world. Eventually locating Earth, Galactus is driven off by the Fantastic Four, Uatu the Watcher, and the rebellious Silver Surfer after the Human Torch\u2014with the Watcher's assistance\u2014retrieves the Ultimate Nullifier from Taa II. Although Galactus leaves Earth, vowing that he will never try to consume it again, he banishes the Surfer to Earth for betraying him. Galactus later returns for his former herald, but the Surfer is unrepentant and chooses to remain on Earth. Thor learns of Galactus' origin when the entity comes into conflict with Ego the Living Planet.\nReturning to Earth, Galactus unsuccessfully tries to re-enlist the Silver Surfer. After the Fantastic Four and the Surfer defeat Galactus's new herald, the Air-Walker, Mister Fantastic reprograms Galactus's ship to travel to the Negative Zone, which contains many uninhabited worlds that could potentially be consumed. Thor and Hercules encounter Galactus when his next herald, Firelord, travels to Earth to be free of his master. Galactus frees Firelord when Thor presents Galactus with the magical Asgardian suit of armor named the Destroyer to animate and use as a herald.\nGalactus comes into conflict with the High Evolutionary when attempting to devour Counter-Earth, but he is temporarily transformed into harmless energy after attempting to devour the planet Poppup, the homeworld of the Impossible Man. After returning to normal form, Galactus is sought by the Fantastic Four to help stop a new cosmic threat, the Sphinx. Mr. Fantastic offers to release Galactus from his vow to not devour Earth if he helps defeat the Sphinx. Galactus agrees, if the Fantastic Four first recruit a being called Tyros as a new herald. The quartet succeed, and the newly empowered and renamed Terrax leads his master to Earth. Galactus locates and defeats the Sphinx in Egypt, but is confronted by Mr. Fantastic, who, unbeknownst to Galactus, wields a fake Ultimate Nullifier. Unable to read Richards' mind (which is protected by the Watcher), Galactus retreats.\nGalactus empowers and uses the superheroine Dazzler to locate a missing Terrax, who is in fact hiding from his master inside a black hole. The Dazzler defeats and retrieves Terrax, and forces Galactus to return her to Earth. Galactus is fooled by the Galadorian Spaceknight Rom into trying to devour the Black Nebula, the homeworld of the Dire Wraiths, but he is repelled by the Wraiths' Dark Sun. A weakened Galactus pursues the rebellious Terrax to Earth and strips him of his power. Near death, Galactus is saved by the Fantastic Four and the Avengers while also acquiring another herald: Nova (Frankie Raye), who offers herself as Galactus' herald in exchange for him sparing Earth again. Galactus devours the Skrulls' throneworld of Tarnax IV, and discusses his role in the universe with fellow cosmic entity Death. Mr. Fantastic is captured by the Shi'ar for saving Galactus' life, and is tried by all of the aliens who survived the annihilation of their homeworlds by Galactus. During the trial, the cosmic entity Eternity \u2014 the sentient embodiment of space and reality of the Marvel Universe \u2014 intervenes, allowing all beings present to momentarily become one with the universe, allowing them to understand that Galactus is a necessary part of the cosmic order.\nDuring the Secret Wars, Galactus attempts to consume Battleworld to force the Beyonder to remove his hunger, but his plan is foiled by Doctor Doom. Galactus grants clemency to the Silver Surfer, who aids his former master against the Elders of the Universe and the In-Betweener. Galactus also rescues the Surfer and Nova II from Mephisto's realm, and aids the cosmic hierarchy in a war against the mad Eternal Thanos, who wields the Infinity Gauntlet.\nWhen Nova II is conscience-stricken at causing the death of billions of aliens, Galactus takes on a new herald, the bloodthirsty Morg the Executioner. Tyrant eventually returns and Morg sacrifices himself to stop the former creation of Galactus by using the Ultimate Nullifier. Galactus then decides, with help from his new herald Red Shift, to only devour the energy of living beings, which brings him into conflict with alien races and Earth's superheroes. During a final confrontation near Chandilar, the throneworld of the Shi'ar, the Silver Surfer turns Galactus' siphoning machines against him. A starving Galactus dies and assumes the form of a star. The death of Galactus allows the entity Abraxas (a metaphysical embodiment of destruction) to emerge from imprisonment. The entity wreaks havoc across thousands of alternate universes, killing various incarnations of Galactus before the children of Mr. Fantastic \u2014 Franklin Richards and Valeria von Doom \u2014 exhaust their powers to restore the original Galactus. Galactus then provides Mr. Fantastic with the Ultimate Nullifier, which he uses to reset reality and prevent Abraxas' initial escape and destruction.\nConscience-stricken, Galactus tries to rid himself of his cosmic hunger by feeding on the power from the Infinity Gems, but is tricked into releasing the Hunger, a being which feeds on entire galaxies. The Hunger is destroyed when Thanos orchestrates a final battle with Galactus. When an alien race develops a technology to make planets invisible to Galactus, he empowers the Human Torch (who has traded powers with his sister the Invisible Woman and becomes the Invisible Boy as a result of this) and utilizes the hero as an unwilling herald to locate the planets. The Fantastic Four and Quasar free the Torch by changing Galactus back into the humanoid Galan, who chooses to exile himself to an energy-rich alternate dimension before he can transform back into Galactus so that he can feed on that reality without endangering planets.\nGalactus consumes Beta Ray Bill's homeworld with the help of his new herald, Stardust. After Annihilus declares war on the universe, the entity attacks and destroys the Kyln, freeing former Galactus foes Tenebrous and Aegis. Sensing their release, Galactus temporarily releases Stardust from his service and re-employs the Silver Surfer as his herald due to his familiarity with their old foes. Tenebrous and Aegis, however, find and defeat the Surfer and Galactus and deliver them to Annihilus. Annihilus intends to use Galactus as a weapon to destroy all life in the universe, but is thwarted when the entity is freed by Drax the Destroyer. Galactus retaliates and destroys most of Annihilus' forces. Seeking a final confrontation with Tenebrous and Aegis, Galactus sends the Silver Surfer to locate them. The Surfer eventually draws the pair into the barrier between the universe and the Negative Zone, which destroys both of them.\nAfter an encounter with Epoch, Galactus consumes the planet Orbucen. When a distraught Beta Ray Bill seeks vengeance for the destruction of the Korbinites' homeworld, Galactus relents and creates a female Korbinite as a companion for Bill. Galactus also consumes the planet Sakaar, earning the enmity of the Hulk's alien-born twin sons, Skaar and Hiro-Kala.\nThe Silver Surfer finds the body of a future Galactus underneath New York City, and he summons the present Galactus to Earth. Mr. Fantastic explains that, in the distant future, the heroes on a dying Earth had killed Galactus and then escaped to the present via time travel. When Galactus discovers these heroes now live on a planet called Nu-Earth, he destroys it and its inhabitants in retribution.\nA tear in the fabric of space caused by the Annihilation Wave and other interstellar conflicts allows the extra-universal forces of the Cancerverse (an alternate universe without death) to invade. Galactus, the Celestials and the resurrected Tenebrous and Aegis combat the powerful Cancerverse weapon: the Galactus Engine (constructed from the corpse of the Cancerverse's counterpart to Galactus). During the events of the Chaos War, Galactus is teleported to Earth by the Olympian demigod Hercules to help fight the Chaos King, a metaphysical embodiment of Oblivion and another antithesis of Eternity. While the Hulk and his allies the God Squad, Alpha Flight, and several members of the Avengers fight Amatsu-Mikaboshi's forces, Amadeus Cho and Galactus develop a machine which will move Earth to a safe location in a sealed-off continuum, only to adapt the plan by trapping Amatsu-Mikaboshi in that dimension instead.\nAfter an encounter with the High Evolutionary, Galactus invades Asgard, home of the Norse gods, seeking an Asgardian artifact to sate his hunger and spare future civilizations. Odin, ruler of the Norse gods, contends that Galactus wishes to ensure that he is not replaced in the next universe. To avoid a protracted battle, the Silver Surfer offers to remain on Earth to guard the artifact on the condition that Galactus may have it once Asgard eventually passes. Galactus recruits a human preacher from Earth named Pastor Mike (full name unknown) that he names Praeter to be his new herald. Later, when the Mad Celestials from Earth-4280 invade, Galactus destroys one before being struck down by the others. Revived by Franklin Richards, he and Franklin succeed in vanquishing the remaining Celestials, and prevent the destruction of Earth. In the aftermath, Galactus learns that he will no longer face the eventual end of the universe alone; he and Franklin will witness it together.\nGalactus is then pulled through a hole in space-time to an alternate universe and meets another version of himself: a space-faring mechanical hive mind called Gah Lak Tus. After the two merge with one another, Galactus makes his way towards this universe's Earth in an attempt to consume it. The heroes of the alternate Earth travel to Earth-616 to acquire information on Galactus and eventually manage to send Galactus to the Negative Zone, reasoning that he will eventually starve to death, as the region is composed of antimatter. A comatose Galactus is found by the Eternals and Aarkus, who hope to use him in their war against the Kree.\nGalactus returns to the universe, and after an encounter with Squirrel Girl, is forced into his own incubator by the Ultimates, who are determined to end his threat. Galactus re-emerges as a Lifebringer instead of a Devourer of Worlds, his first act as such being to re-create Archeopia, the first planet that he ever consumed. Galactus later rescues the team at the behest of Eternity, and learns that the latter has been imprisoned by an unknown force. Galactus also comes into conflict with fellow cosmic entities Master Order and Lord Chaos, who, along with the Molecule Man, wish for Galactus to return to his former role as a Devourer of Worlds and thereby restore the cosmic order. Galactus locates the hero Anti-Man outside the Multiverse and, after transforming him into a Herald of Life, sends him to recruit the recently disbanded Ultimates to help discover the identity of Eternity's captor, who is later revealed to be the First Firmament, the first iteration of the cosmos. Master Order and Lord Chaos bring Galactus to trial before the Living Tribunal, still seeking to restore Galactus to his former state for the sake of the cosmic order. Although Galactus successfully argues that the balance of the new Multiverse is different and that his old role is obsolete, the Tribunal is destroyed by a Firmament-influenced Master Order and Lord Chaos. After a brief battle, Master Order decides to create a new cosmic order, which it and Lord Chaos would control. Their former servant, the In-Betweener, is forcibly merged with them into a new cosmic being called Logos. After destroying several Celestials, Logos forcibly transforms Galactus back into the Devourer of Worlds. The process is reversed when Anti-Man sacrifices his life to restore Galactus as the Lifebringer. Galactus then swears to free the imprisoned Eternity.\nDuring the \"Infinity Countdown\" storyline, the Silver Surfer requests Galactus' aid in defeating Ultron/Hank Pym by consuming the planet Saiph, which is overrun by Ultron drones. Galactus reluctantly agrees. After consuming Saiph, Galactus' hunger returns and the Silver Surfer becomes his herald again as he takes Galactus to find an uninhabited planet.\nReturning to Earth, Galactus has a confrontation with Doctor Doom and the Fantastic Four, with Doom revealing his plans to harness Galactus' power as an energy source. Banished to the mystical realms by an alien sorcerer, Galactus becomes entangled in the schemes of Dormammu and Mephisto. Galactus begins to consume mystical energy, eventually absorbing Dormammu and other mystical entities, and in doing so goes insane and destabilizes reality. Doctor Strange intervenes and \u2013 with the aid of Eternity and the Living Tribunal \u2013 is able to undo the damage wrought by Galactus.\nAn injured Galactus crashlands on Asgard, apparently seeking asylum from the cause of his universe's destruction: the Black Winter (Fimbulwinter), a cosmic entity that fulfills a similar purpose to Galactus on a far larger scale \u2014 rather than simply devouring planets, it consumes entire universes. Galactus reveals to All-Father Thor that he had a vision of Thor being responsible for his death. In a bid to destroy the Black Winter, Galactus turns Thor into his Herald of Thunder. Thor later learns that the Black Winter considers Galactus to be \"his\" herald. This causes an angered Thor to drain Galactus of his energies enough to turn him into a desiccated husk. When the Black Winter moves in to claim Galactus' body, Thor uses it as a bomb to decimate the Black Winter.\nPowers and abilities.\nGalactus was created during the union of the Sentience of the (previous) Universe and Galan of Taa, and is described as \"the physical, metamorphosed embodiment of a cosmos.\" Although he is not an abstract entity, his true form cannot be perceived by most beings; each species sees Galactus in a form they can comprehend, similar to their race or a deity of their religion. Galactus can also appear as a humanoid star when addressing fellow members of the cosmic hierarchy. Through his actions of consuming planets, Galactus embodies a living force of nature whose existence acts as a third force to the conceptual entities: Eternity and Death, as well serving as a cosmic test of survival for civilizations. Additionally, the continued existence of Galactus ensures the confinement of the cosmic entity Abraxas. As Galactus requires planets with the potential to support life, his existence also causes the extinction of entire extraterrestrial civilizations.\nGalactus' overall power level is variable, based on the planets he has recently consumed. If he does not feed regularly, he becomes considerably weaker; on one occasion, while in a starved, weakened state, he was defeated by the combined efforts of both the Fantastic Four and the Avengers. On the other hand, if Galactus overfeeds on planets, he can greatly increase his powers, temporarily. After consuming four planets, Galactus increased his powers to the point that he could easily destroy a Mad Celestial, although he was still not powerful enough to take on three of them at once.\nGalactus' upper limit is unknown. On a few occasions, storylines reached their climax at a point where Galactus lacks his customary restraint, and becomes insatiable. Writer Walt Simonson depicted a Galactus in a possible future whose hunger was altered by the Celestial Tiamut, with Galactus consuming the universe due to his rabid hunger. In the \"Herald Supreme\" storyline, Mark Waid showed Galactus' uncontrollable hunger that results from his consumption of the mystical being Dormammu. Jonathan Hickman and Sanford Greene wrote a story taking place in an alternate reality, where Galactus begins ravenously consuming as many planets as possible, and \"overflowing with the power of hundreds of consumed planets,\" he crushes a Celestial Host.\nThe consumption of planets is what maintains Galactus' life and power. He usually employs the Elemental Converter, which converts matter into energy more efficiently, even though he is capable of feeding without it. Alternatively, Galactus can absorb energy directly from cosmic beings and even mystical entities\u2014though with unpredictable results. Processing this cosmic energy allows Galactus to utilize a force known as the Power Cosmic to perform great feats, which have included universal cosmic awareness, telepathy, telekinesis, energy projection; size alteration; transmutation of matter; teleportation of objects across space, the creation of force fields and interdimensional portals; the creation of life, the resurrection of the dead, manipulating souls, memories and emotions, and mass-scale events such as recreating dead worlds in every detail (including illusions of their entire populations) and destroying multiple planetary systems simultaneously.\nTo aid in his search for suitable planets, Galactus frequently appoints an individual as his herald, granting each one in turn a small fraction of the Power Cosmic. This power replaces the auras (or souls) of the recipient, with each wielder's physical form adapting to store the energy and in turn allow manipulation for feats such as energy projection. Galactus is also capable of removing the Power Cosmic from the herald. \nGalactus also possesses scientific knowledge that is beyond comprehension as one of the oldest living entities in the universe. He is capable of building massive starships of his own design, humanoid robots called Punishers used to battle foes beneath his attention, and the Solar System-sized and M\u00f6bius strip-shaped space station named Taa II. Mr. Fantastic has speculated that Taa II may be the greatest source of energy in the universe.\nUltimate Nullifier.\nThe Ultimate Nullifier, a device capable of completely erasing any chosen target from existence, was initially believed to be linked to or created by Galactus. In the Nullifier's first appearance in \"Fantastic Four\" #50, Uatu sends the Human Torch to retrieve it from Taa II, a massive structure built as a monument to the original world of Taa. While this issue presents the Ultimate Nullifier as originating from Taa II, later sources list its origins as unknown. Its destructive potential is emphasized by the fact that Galactus retreats when threatened with its use.\nThe Ultimate Nullifier is generally kept within Taa II, though at times Galactus has been known to carry it aboard his spherical starship. If the Nullifier is stolen or kept in other locales such as the Fantastic Four's headquarters, it inevitably returns to Galactus' possession. In the Abraxas saga, Galactus demonstrates the ability to summon the Nullifier at will and states it to be a part of himself.\nThe 2022 storyline \"Reckoning War\" reveals that the Ultimate Nullifier was created by the Watchers during a war with the Prosilicans and was used to kill 90% of the universe's population.\nThe Ultimate Nullifier is capable of erasing from existence anything its wielder can fully comprehend, such as destroying an entire universe if the wielder could conceive of it in its entirety. However, most beings lack the focus to control the Nullifier, and misuse can result in the annihilation of the wielder as well as the target. Accounts from Uatu describe a power-adjustment mechanism capable of erasing a solar system in a microsecond, and its effects have been depicted as either a spreading sphere of nullification or directed energy beams. In some instances, beings destroyed by the Nullifier are sent to the realm of Oblivion, with the Time Variance Authority and Uatu stating that its use erases the target and all traces of their actions from reality.\nHeralds.\nThe Silver Surfer is a recurring ally and herald of Galactus, and was the first herald to be introduced into the Marvel Universe. Other characters have also filled the role of a herald intermittently.\nCharacters who debuted as heralds or creations of Galactus:\nThe following characters have fulfilled the role of a herald for only one storyline:\nOther versions.\n\"The Adventures of the X-Men\".\nAn alternate universe variant of Galactus from Earth-92131 appears in \"The Adventures of the X-Men\" #12.\nAmalgam Comics.\nGalactiac, an amalgamation of Galactus and DC Comics character Brainiac from Earth-9602, appears in Amalgam Comics. In addition to consuming planetary energy, he leaves small aspects of the worlds he consumes intact for personal study.\n\"Bullet Points\".\nAn alternate universe variant of Galactus from Earth-70105 appears in \"Bullet Points\" (January \u2013 May 2007).\n\"Cosmic Ghost Rider\".\nAn alternate universe variant of Galactus appears in \"Thanos\" (vol. 2) #16.\n\"Earth X\".\nAn alternate universe variant of Galactus from Earth-9997 appears in \"Earth X\". This version is one of three cosmic entities who keep the Celestials in check, with his role being to consume planets to prevent them from overpopulating the universe. Additionally, Franklin Richards goes on to adopt the mantle of Galactus.\n\"Exiles\".\nAn alternate universe variant of Galactus from Earth-552 appears in \"Exiles\". This version restores worlds destroyed by the Blight rather than consuming them.\n\"Galacta, Daughter of Galactus\".\nAn alternate universe variant of Galactus from Earth-610102 appears in \"Galacta, Daughter of Galactus\". This version, via a \"celestial parasite\", gave rise to the titular Gali / Galacta, who secretly lives on Earth working as a doctor and superhero while seeking to suppress her own hunger.\n\"Galactus: Dawn of the Heralds\".\nAn alternate universe variant of Galactus fused with Ultron from Earth-22666 appears in \"Marvel Universe 2001: Millennial Visions\" #1.\n\"Guardians of the Galaxy\".\nA possible future variant of Galactus from Earth-691 appears in \"Guardians of the Galaxy\". This version no longer consumes worlds as his herald, the Keeper, possesses sufficient power to satiate his hunger.\n\"Heroes Reborn\".\nA variant of Galactus from a pocket universe created by Franklin Richards appears in \"Heroes Reborn\". This version is worshipped by the Inhumans.\n\"King Thor\".\nA distant future variant of Galactus from Earth-14412 appears in \"The Mighty Thor\" #700.

This version eventually merges with the Silver Surfer and vows to repair rather than destroy worlds.\nUltimate Marvel.\nAn alternate universe variant of Galactus from Earth-1610 called Gah Lak Tus appears in the \"Ultimate Galactus Trilogy\". This version is a hive mind of city-sized robotic drones that telepathically broadcast fear into planets' inhabitants, then send envoys to introduce a flesh-eating virus onto planets. Eons ago, the ancient Kree built Gah Lak Tus to \"purify\" the universe, but it escaped their control and evolved into its current form.\n\"What If Uatu The Watcher Had Never Interfered?\".\nAn alternate universe variant of Galactus appears in \"Reckoning War: Trial of the Watcher\". After Uatu is forbidden by his father Ikor to interfere with the Fantastic Four's battle with Galactus, the latter injures most of the group until Reed Richards develops a weapon capable of killing Galactus. He then uses the energy left from Galactus's death to create a new source of unlimited clean power for Earth; however, the use of said power results in the erasure of the entire universe.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13097", "revid": "628775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13097", "title": "Game Boy Color", "text": "Handheld game console by Nintendo\nThe (abbreviated as GBC or CGB) is an 8-bit handheld game console developed by Nintendo. It was released in Japan on October 21, 1998, and in international markets the following month. Compared with the original Game Boy, the Game Boy Color features a color TFT screen instead of monochrome, a CPU running at up to twice the speed, and four times as much memory. It is backward compatible with games developed for its predecessor. The Game Boy Color was released during the fifth generation of video game consoles and competed with the WonderSwan and Neo Geo Pocket, and Genesis Nomad.\nThe handheld is slightly thicker, taller and has a smaller screen than its immediate predecessor, the Game Boy Pocket, but is significantly smaller than the original Game Boy. As with its predecessors, the Game Boy Color has a custom 8-bit processor made by Sharp. The American English spelling of the system's name, \"Game Boy Color\", remains consistent throughout the world.\nThe Game Boy Color received positive reviews upon release, and was praised for its backwards compatibility with games from its predecessor. It had a relatively brief lifespan, being succeeded by the Game Boy Advance after less than three years on the market. The Game Boy and the Game Boy Color combined have sold 118.69 million units worldwide, making them the fourth best-selling system of all time. Its best-selling games are \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold\" and \"Silver\" (1999), which shipped 23 million units worldwide.\nHistory.\nThe original Game Boy was first introduced in 1989. The device was a monochrome handheld, and one of its competitors, the Atari Lynx, featured a color screen. While the Lynx's color display was visually impressive, it was criticized for its bulky size and poor battery life. The Game Boy, in contrast, offered superior portability and longevity, propelling it to immense popularity. Publicly, Nintendo pledged to develop a color Game Boy, but only when technology limitations could be addressed.\nInternally, a team led by Satoru Okada, who played a key role in the original Game Boy's design, was experimenting with color displays. Their early-1990s prototype, codenamed \"Project Atlantis,\" featured a color screen and a powerful 32-bit processor from Sharp. However, the team was not satisfied with the outcome and shelved further development.\nDespite the lack of color, consumer interest in the Game Boy remained strong. In 1996, Nintendo released the slimmer Game Boy Pocket, and the launch of the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" series that same year further boosted sales. However, developers were losing interest in creating new games for the aging platform.\nAdditional market pressure for Nintendo came in October 1997 when news broke about Bandai's new handheld, the WonderSwan. The project was led by Gunpei Yokoi, the engineer who led the development of the Game &amp; Watch series and the original Game Boy. Yokoi had left Nintendo in 1996 following the commercial failure of his final project at the company, the Virtual Boy. His departure caused a stir, with investors dumping Nintendo stock, forcing a temporary halt on trading at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Yokoi was killed in a roadside accident in 1997 before the WonderSwan's release.\nFaced with mounting pressure, Okada revisited Project Atlantis. Prioritizing quickly bringing a device to market over processing power, he dropped the 32-bit chip in favor of a faster version of the existing Game Boy's 8-bit processor that would allow for a sooner launch and maintain compatibility with the existing library of Game Boy games.\nThe Game Boy Color was announced in March 1998 and released in Japan that October. It received an international rollout throughout November (amid the busy Christmas holiday shopping season), reaching North America on the 18th, Europe on the 23rd, and Australasia on the 27th. Launching at a price of US$, the Game Boy Color ultimately outsold the WonderSwan, which went on sale in March 1999.\nThe Game Boy Color had a relatively short lifespan, being on the market for only two and a half years before being succeeded by the Game Boy Advance in 2001. The successor finally brought the 32-bit processing power envisioned in Project Atlantis. Despite the new system, the Game Boy Color remained in production, serving as a budget-friendly alternative. The last units were reportedly sold by March 2003.\nHardware.\nThe Game Boy Color uses a custom system-on-a-chip (SoC) that integrates the CPU and other major components into a single package, designated the CPU\u00a0CGB by Nintendo and manufactured by the Sharp Corporation. While the CPU\u00a0CGB was a new design for the Game Boy Color, the technology was largely an evolution of the ten-year-old DMG-CPU SoC used in the original Game Boy.\nWithin the CPU\u00a0CGB, the main processor is the same \"Sharp SM83\" that powered the original Game Boy. Derived from two other 8-bit processors: the Intel 8080 and the Zilog Z80, the SM83 features the seven 8-bit registers of the 8080\u2014lacking the alternate registers of the Z80\u2014but uses the Z80's programming syntax and additional bit manipulation instructions, along with new instructions optimized for operations specific to the hardware design.\nWhile in the original Game Boy, the SM83 operated at a clock rate of 4.194304 megahertz\u00a0(MHz), games can command the processor in the Game Boy Color to operate in \"dual-speed mode,\" doubling its frequency to 8.388608\u00a0MHz. This allowed developers to achieve twice the processing power when creating games exclusively for the Game Boy Color, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing games.\nThe CPU\u00a0CGB incorporates the \"Picture Processing Unit\", a basic GPU that renders visuals using 16\u00a0kilobytes\u00a0(KB) of Video RAM, twice as much as that of the original Game Boy. Games developed specifically for the Game Boy Color could fully utilize this additional memory, enabling enhanced effects and displaying up to 56 colors simultaneously from a palette of 32,768 colors. Programmers subsequently developed the \"high color mode\" technique, which involved rapidly switching color palettes to display over 2,000 colors at once. This feature was used in games such as \"The Fish Files\", \"The New Addams Family\" and \"\". When a Game Pak compatible with the original Game Boy is inserted, the additional video RAM is disabled.\nThe screen is a 2.3-inch (diagonal) thin-film transistor (TFT) color liquid-crystal display (LCD), measuring wide by high. The screen aspect ratio and resolution remain identical to the original Game Boy at 160 pixels wide by 144 pixels high in a 10:9 format. Like the original Game Boy and Game Boy Pocket before it and the Game Boy Advance after it, the screen is passively reflective, with a surface behind it that reflects ambient light back through the liquid crystal elements toward the viewer. Because there is no backlight, the device can be hard to use in dark environments.\nAdditionally, the SoC contains a 2\u00a0KB \"bootstrap\" ROM which is used to start up the device, 127\u00a0B of high RAM that can be accessed faster (similar to a CPU cache), and the \"Audio Processing Unit\", a programmable sound generator with four channels: a pulse wave generation channel with frequency and volume variation, a second pulse wave generation channel with only volume variation, a wave channel that can reproduce a waveform, and a white noise channel with volume variation. The motherboard of the Game Boy Color contains a 32\u00a0KB \"work\" RAM chip, four times more than the original Game Boy.\nThe Game Boy Color features a D-pad (directional pad), four action buttons ('A', 'B', 'START', and 'SELECT'), and a sliding on\u2013off switch on the right side of the device. Volume is adjusted by a potentiometer dial on the left side of the device. The left side also has a Game Link Cable port for connecting up to four Game Boy devices for multiplayer games or data transfer. The port used on the Game Boy Color is of a smaller design first introduced on the Game Boy Pocket and requires an adapter to link with the original Game Boy. The Game Boy Color also included a \"high-speed\" mode that allowed data to be transmitted up to 64 times faster over the Game Link Cable than on the original Game Boy. The Game Boy Color included an infrared communications port for wireless data transfer, but it was only supported by a small number of games and consequently was not included on the later Game Boy Advance line.\nModel colors.\nNintendo had seen success selling colored variations of the Play It Loud! Game Boy and the Game Boy Pocket, so the company released the Color in several case variations.\nThe logo for Game Boy Color spells out the word \"COLOR\" in the five original colors in which the unit was manufactured: Berry (C), Grape (O), Kiwi (L), Dandelion (O), and Teal (R). Another color released at the same time was \"Atomic Purple\", made of a translucent purple plastic. Other colors were sold as limited editions or in specific countries.\nGames.\nThe Game Boy Color launched with an extensive game library, thanks to its ability to play original Game Boy titles. At launch, it featured three exclusive games: \"Pocket Bomberman\", \"Tetris DX\" and \"Wario Land II\". Over time, the system amassed more than 900 titles, in addition to the original Game Boy's catalog of over 1,000 games. In a promotional list of 296 Game Boy Color games, 100 were compatible with the original Game Boy.\nNintendo prohibited simple \"colorized\" re-releases of monochrome Game Boy titles, requiring developers to implement meaningful gameplay enhancements. These additions included new levels, characters, items, or mechanics that leveraged the system's color capabilities. To ensure these enhancements were significant, Nintendo mandated that they be easily recognizable to players familiar with the monochrome version.6 Many of these enhanced versions, often called \"Deluxe\" or \"DX\", became some of the Game Boy Color's most popular titles, including \"Tetris DX\" and \"\".\nThe Game Boy Color's improved display and enhanced processing power also enabled more faithful ports of NES games, in contrast to the heavily modified versions created for the original Game Boy due to its monochrome display limitations. One of the most notable examples is \"Super Mario Bros. Deluxe\", which showcased the Game Boy Color's ability to deliver an authentic port of the NES classic.\n\"Tetris\" for the original Game Boy is the best-selling game compatible with Game Boy Color, \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold\" and \"Silver\" are the best-selling games developed primarily for it, and \"Pok\u00e9mon Crystal\" was the best-selling Game Boy Color exclusive title.\nThe last Game Boy Color game ever released is the Japanese exclusive \"Doraemon no Study Boy: Kanji Yomikaki Master\", on July 18, 2003. The last game released in North America is \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" on November 15, 2002, while Europe's was \"\" released on January 10, 2003.\nBeyond the platform's official titles, as of 2025[ [update]], an active online community continues to create new titles for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color through tools like GB Studio, a free and user-friendly game-building engine that simplifies the process compared to manual coding. GB Studio has been used by professional game studios like Krool Toys, who created the promotional title Grimace's Birthday for McDonald's in 2023.\nCartridges.\nGames are stored on cartridges called Game Boy Game Paks, using read-only memory (ROM) chips. Due to the limitations of the 8-bit architecture of the device, the maximum ROM size the processor could access at any time was 32\u00a0KB. Nintendo overcame this limitation with a \"Memory Bank Controller\"\u00a0(MBC) in the cartridge. This chip sits between the processor and the ROM and can switch between banks of 32\u00a0KB ROM. Using this technology, Nintendo created Game Boy Color games up to 8\u00a0megabytes in size. Game Paks can also provide additional functionality to the Game Boy system. Some cartridges include up to 128\u00a0KB of RAM to increase performance, which can be battery-backed to save progress when the handheld is off, real-time clock chips can keep track of time even when the device is off, and Rumble Pak cartridges added vibration feedback to enhance gameplay.\nThe Game Boy Color has backward compatibility with all original Game Boy games. Three main Game Pak cartridge types for the handheld were released:\nAccessories.\nNintendo released several add-ons for the Game Boy Color, including:\nReception.\nSales.\nThe Game Boy and Game Boy Color were both commercially successful, selling 118.69\u00a0million units worldwide: 32.47\u00a0million in Japan, 44.06\u00a0million in the Americas, and 42.16\u00a0million in all other regions. At the time of its discontinuation in 2003, the combined sales of all Game Boy variants made it the best-selling game console of all time. In later years, its sales were surpassed by the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2 and Nintendo Switch, making it the fourth-best-selling console the second-best-selling handheld of all time, as of 2024[ [update]]. Sales of the device were in part driven by the success of \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver\" and \"Pok\u00e9mon Crystal\", with combined sales of 29.5\u00a0million units, making them one of the best selling-video games of all time.\nSales of the Game Boy Color were strong at launch. Nintendo of America reported a sale of one\u00a0million units from launch to December 1998, and two\u00a0million by July 1999. Retail chains in the United States reported unexpectedly high demand for the console, with executives of FuncoLand reporting \"very pleasant and unpredicted\" sales and Electronics Boutique stating \"the entire Game Boy Color line just exploded, including accessories\" upon release. Faced with high worldwide demand and competitive retail pricing, retailers such as CompUSA sold out of Game Boy Color stock in the weeks before the 1998 Christmas season.\nCritical reception.\nReception of the Game Boy Color was positive, with critics praising the addition of color and improved clarity of the display.\nAffiliated publications such as \"Total Games\" praised the handheld for its \"bright, colorful picture that can be viewed in direct light\", backward compatibility features preserving the \"vast catalogue of original Game Boy games\", and improved technical performance. \"Computer and Video Games\" praised the Game Boy Color for making the Game Boy library of games \"look better than ever \u2013 everything is crystal clear, bright and in [color]\". Writing for \"GameSpot\", Chris Johnston stated that the display was \"crystal clear\" and free of motion blur, stating that \"Tetris DX\" was the \"killer app\" of the launch titles on the platform.\nMilder reviews included those by \"Arcade\", who said that while that the colors were \"very impressive\" they were \"not as eyeball-popping as you might have hoped for [...] it's mostly seaweed greens, rusty browns, timid yellows and the like\". They concluded that \"nothing about [the Game Boy Color] is very radical\" but said the device was \"Game Boy as it always should have been\". Reviewers pointed out other drawbacks including that the system was still using an 8-bit architecture when competitors had moved onto 16-bit handheld systems and that the non-backlit screen required that the user be in a well lit area.\nLegacy.\nCommentary on the legacy of the Game Boy Color has been shaped by the perception that the handheld was as an incremental and transitional upgrade of the Game Boy rather than a completely new device. Author Jeff Ryan noted the Game Boy Color had a reputation as a \"legacy machine\" that found success mostly due to its backward compatibility, as \"few wanted to lose all the \"Dr. Mario\" and \"Pok\u00e9mon\" cartridges they had amassed over the years.\" Quoted in \"Retro Gamer\", Blitz Games Studios developer Bob Pape acknowledged that although \"backwards compatibility more or less defined (the) Game Boy Color\", the handheld \"ticked all the right boxes with regards to size, battery life, reliability and most importantly backwards compatibility\".\nPositive assessments of the legacy of the Game Boy Color have focused on the merits of its game library, particularly for its third-party and import titles. Travis Fahs of \"IGN\" noted while \"the Game Boy Color's life was relatively brief\", it \"built up a small library of excellent games\", including \"Wario Land 3\" and \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver\", and a \"unique\" and \"previously unheard of\" line of successful third-party games, including \"Dragon Warrior Monsters\", \"Metal Gear Solid\" and \"Yu-Gi-Oh! Dark Duel Stories\". Ashley Day of \"Retro Gamer\" noted that the handheld had an \"overlooked\" status, stating \"the Game Boy Color (has) an unfair reputation as the one Nintendo handheld with few worthwhile titles, but this simply isn't the case...returning to the Game Boy Color now reveals a wealth of great games that you never knew existed, especially those available on import.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is an island nation that exists in the Marvel Universe and a prominent location in the X-Men comics. The fictional nation served as an allegory for slavery and later for South African apartheid before becoming a mutant homeland and subsequently a disaster zone. The island is located off the southeastern African coast southwest from Seychelles and northeast of Madagascar. Its capital city was Hammer Bay.\nPublication history.\nGenosha, a significant location in the Marvel Universe, first appeared in \"Uncanny X-Men\" #235 in 1988. The island nation was created by Rick Leonardi and Chris Claremont, who used it as an allegory for apartheid-era South Africa, portraying a society where mutants were subjugated and transformed into mindless \"mutates\" by a brutal regime led by the Genegineer, David Moreau. This portrayal of Genosha highlighted issues of oppression and exploitation, resonating with themes of racial and social injustice.\nInitially depicted as a paradise with a dark underbelly, Genosha was ruled by a government that treated mutants as second-class citizens, exploiting them as slave labor. The nation's early stories drew parallels to real-world issues of apartheid, reflecting Claremont's intention to use the X-Men comics as a platform for exploring complex social and political issues. The island's story evolved dramatically over time. In \"Uncanny X-Men\" #255 (1989), the depiction of Genosha expanded to show the nation descending into civil war, with mutants and \"normal\" humans locked in a violent conflict, reminiscent of the ethnic conflicts in Bosnia during the 1990s. This civil war storyline deepened Genosha's role in the X-Men mythos as a symbol of the broader struggles faced by mutants.\nMagneto, the X-Men's long-time adversary, was later granted control of Genosha by the United Nations in an attempt to deter him from further aggression against humanity. Under Magneto's rule, the island became a sanctuary for mutants, but this was short-lived. In \"New X-Men\" #115 (2001), Cassandra Nova, the evil twin of Charles Xavier, unleashed a devastating Sentinel attack on Genosha, wiping out most of its population.\nFictional country history.\nMutant apartheid.\nGenosha is located off the east coast of Africa, to the north of Madagascar, and boasted a high standard of living, developed economy, and freedom from the political and racial turmoil that characterized neighboring nations. However, Genosha's prosperity was built upon the enslavement of its mutant population. Mutants in Genosha were the property of the state and children who were positively identified with the mutant gene were put through a process developed by David Moreau, commonly known as the Genegineer, stripped of free will and made into \"mutates\" (a term for those who gained superpowers from external sources rather than possessing them innately). The Genegineer was also capable of modifying certain mutant abilities to fulfill specific labor shortages. Citizenship in Genosha is permanent and the government does not recognize any emigration. Citizens who attempt to leave the country are tracked down and forcibly brought back to the island by the Press Gang, consisting of Hawkshaw, Pipeline, Punchout, and Wipeout. Mutant problems are handled by a special group known as the Magistrates.\nConflict and Magneto's reign.\nA new Genoshan regime that promised better treatment of mutants was put in place after Cameron Hodge's death. A period of general turmoil and a number of attacks by superhumans, including Magneto's Acolytes who were unwilling to forgive the former Genoshan government for its crimes against mutants, followed. X-Factor returns to the island to help restore peace between its government and a rogue group of superpowered beings who fled the island.\nThe United Nations cede control of Genosha to Magneto after he demands to establish a mutant nation. Magneto and his Acolytes reestablish a modicum of peace and stability until civil war breaks out between him and the remaining humans on the island, led by the Magistrates. Magneto eventually defeats the Magistrates and restores order to the island.\nGenosha had a population of sixteen million mutants and a stable, advanced society. However, the entire island was reduced to rubble and its mutant population murdered by Cassandra Nova's Sentinels. There were few survivors, many having been evacuated.\nXavier's leadership.\nMagneto and Charles Xavier join forces to rebuild Genosha, as detailed in the series \"Excalibur\" vol. 3 (2004). This goes badly as foreign military forces have thrown up a cordon around the island; no one is allowed to enter or leave. A few survivors and mutants who wish to help with the rebuilding process remain on the island, including Callisto, Freakshow, and Wicked.\nNecrosha and beyond.\nDuring the 2009 event \"Necrosha\", Selene travels to Genosha and uses the Technarch virus to resurrect the millions who died there. Selene is eventually defeated and killed, thus ending the effect of the corrupted Techno-organic virus in the bodies she revived and returning Genosha to an empty land.\nDuring the \"One World Under Doom\" storyline, Genosha is re-established as a republic called Gigosha.\nIn other media.\nMiscellaneous.\nGenosha has been compared to the Confederate States of America in an article by \"The Atlantic\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13104", "revid": "48560679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13104", "title": "Grinnell College", "text": "Private liberal arts college in Grinnell, Iowa, US \nGrinnell College ( ) is a private liberal arts college in Grinnell, Iowa, United States. It was established as Iowa College in 1846 by a group of Congregationalists from New England. It has an \"open curriculum\", which means students need not follow a prescribed list of classes. The college's 120-acre campus includes several listings on the National Register of Historic Places.\nHistory.\nIn 1843, eleven Congregational ministers, all of whom trained at Andover Theological Seminary in Massachusetts, set out to preach on the frontier. The group also sought to establish a college, which followed in 1846, when they collectively established Iowa College in Davenport.\nThe first 25 years of Grinnell's history saw a change in name and location. In Davenport, the college had advocated against slavery and saloons, leading to conflict with the Davenport city council, which retaliated by constructing roads that transected the campus. Iowa College moved farther west from Davenport to the town of Grinnell and unofficially adopted the name of its new home, which itself had been named for the abolitionist minister Josiah Bushnell Grinnell. The name of the corporation, \"The Trustees of Iowa College\", remained, but in 1909 the name \"Grinnell\" was adopted by the trustees for the institution.\nIn its early years, the college experienced setbacks. Although two students received Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1854 (the first to be granted by a college west of the Mississippi River), within 10 years the Civil War had claimed most of Grinnell's students and professors. In the decade following the war, growth resumed: women were officially admitted as candidates for degrees, and the curriculum was enlarged to include then-new areas of academic studies, such as natural sciences with laboratory work.\nIn 1882, Grinnell College was struck by a tornado\u2014then called a cyclone, after which the college yearbook was named. The storm devastated the campus and destroyed both college buildings. Rebuilding began immediately, and the determination to expand was not limited to architecture: the curriculum was again extended to include departments in political science (one of the first in the United States\u2014the University of Minnesota's department was founded in 1879, three years earlier) and modern languages.\nGrinnell became known as the center of the Social Gospel reform movement, as Robert Handy writes, \"The movement centered on the campus of Iowa (now Grinnell) College. Its leading figures were Professor George D. Herron and President George A. Gates\". Other firsts pointed to the lighter side of college life: the first intercollegiate football and baseball games west of the Mississippi were played in Grinnell, and the home teams won.\nAs the 20th century began, Grinnell established a Phi Beta Kappa chapter, introduced the departmental \"major\" system of study, began Grinnell-in-China (an educational mission that lasted until the Japanese invasion and resumed in 1987), and built a women's residence hall system that became a national model. The social consciousness fostered at Grinnell during these years became evident during Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency, when Grinnell graduates Harry Hopkins '12, Chester Davis '11, Paul Appleby '13, Hallie Flanagan '11, and Florence Kerr '12 became influential New Deal administrators. Concern with social issues, educational innovation, and individual expression continue to shape Grinnell. As an example, the school's \"5th year travel-service program\", preceded the establishment of the Peace Corps by many years. Other recent innovations include first-year tutorials, cooperative pre-professional programs, and programs in quantitative studies and the societal impacts of technology. Every year, the college awards the $100,000 Grinnell College Innovator for Social Justice Prize, which is split between the recipient and their organization.\nIn 1975, Grinnell College through their Grinnell Communications subsidiary purchased NBC affiliate WLWD from Avco Broadcasting Corporation for about $13 million. The station changed its call letters to WDTN once the sale closed. Shortly after WDTN became an ABC affiliate, the station was sold off to Hearst Broadcasting for $45\u2013$48 million.\nIn 2022, Grinnell became the first fully unionized undergraduate school in the U.S., when student workers voted to expand their dining hall workers union to include all student workers. The move was supported by the president of the college.\nCampus.\nGrinnell College is located in the town of Grinnell, Iowa, about halfway between Des Moines and Iowa City. The main campus, which was once a stop on the Underground Railroad, is bounded by 6th Avenue on the south, 10th Avenue on the north, East Street on the east and Park Street on the west. The campus contains sixty-three buildings ranging in style from Collegiate Gothic to Bauhaus to Tudor to Modernist. Goodnow Hall and Mears Cottage (1889) are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Immediately west of the college is the North Grinnell Historic District, which contains over 200 National Register of Historic Places contributing buildings.\nThe residential part of campus is divided into three sections: North Campus, East Campus, and South Campus. North and South Campus' dormitories are modeled explicitly after the residential colleges of Oxford and Cambridge. The four East Campus dormitories feature a modern, LEED-certified design constructed from Iowa limestone.\nAll three campuses feature dormitory buildings connected by loggia, an architectural signature of the college. The loggia on South Campus is the only entirely closed loggia, while the loggias on East and North campus are only partially closed. From the time that the first dorm opened in 1915 until the fall of 1968, the nine north campus dorms were used exclusively for male students, and the six south campus dorms reserved for female students. The dorm halls house significantly fewer students than halls at other colleges.\nMost academic buildings are located on the southwestern quarter of campus. The athletic facilities are mostly located north of 10th Avenue.\nThe college maintains a environmental research area called the Conard Environmental Research Area (CERA). The U.S. Green Building Council awarded CERA's Environmental Education Center a gold certification. The building is the first in Iowa to receive the designation.\nDuring the 2000s, the college completed the Charles Benson Bear '39 Recreation and Athletic Center, the Bucksbaum Center for the Arts, the renovation of the Robert Noyce '49 Science Center and the Joe Rosenfield '25 Student Center. Internationally renowned architect C\u00e9sar Pelli designed the athletics center, the Joe Rosenfield '25 Student Center, and the Bucksbaum Center for the Arts.\nThe college is going through a period of new construction which is expected to last until 2034.\nAcademics.\nGrinnell's open curriculum encourages students to take initiative and to assume responsibility for choosing their own courses of study. The sole core, or general education, requirement is the completion of the First-Year Tutorial, a one-semester, four-credit special topics seminar that stresses methods of inquiry, critical analysis, and writing skills. All other classes are chosen, with the direct guidance of a faculty member in the student's major department, by the student.\nGrinnell's three most popular majors among 2021 graduates were Computer Science, Biology/Biological Sciences, and Research &amp; Experimental Psychology.\nGraduate programs.\nAlthough the college does not offer any graduate degrees, it does have dual degree programs with several universities that let Grinnell students move directly into graduate programs. Grinnell participates in a 3\u20132 engineering dual degree program with Columbia University, Washington University in St. Louis, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and California Institute of Technology. It also has a 2\u20131\u20131\u20131 engineering program with Dartmouth College and a Master of Public Health cooperative degree program with University of Iowa.\nReputation.\nGrinnell College has been listed in each edition of Howard &amp; Matthew Greene's guides The Hidden Ivies.\nThe 2025-26 annual ranking of \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" rates it tied for the 13th best liberal arts college overall in the U.S., 3rd for \"Best Undergraduate Teaching, 8th for \"Best Value\", and 13th for \"Most Innovative\".The Princeton Review ranks Grinnell as 10th in Best Classroom Experience. Grinnell is ranked 5th in the 2021 \"Washington Monthly\" rankings for liberal arts colleges, which focus on key outputs such as research, dollar value of scientific grants won, the number of graduates going on to earn Ph.D. degrees, and certain types of public service. \"Kiplinger's Personal Finance\" ranked Grinnell 14th in its 2019 ranking of \"best value\" liberal arts colleges in the United States. In \"Forbes\" magazine's 2015 rankings of academic institutions, \"America's Top Colleges\" (which uses a non-traditional ranking system based on RateMyProfessors.com evaluations, notable alumni, student debt, percentage of students graduating in four years, and the number of students or faculty receiving prestigious awards), Grinnell College was ranked 81st among all colleges and universities, 21st among liberal arts colleges, and 10th in the Midwest.\nFaculty.\nGrinnell had 173 full-time faculty in fall 2020, all of whom possess a doctorate or the terminal degree in their field. In 2024, \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" ranked Grinnell #9 in Best Undergraduate Teaching.\nAdmission.\nIn 2019, \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" classified Grinnell's selectivity as \"most selective\". For Fall 2022, Grinnell received 9,997 freshmen applications; 1,076 were admitted (10.76%). During the 2020-2021 application season, Grinnell offered a standardized test-optional application, due to limited testing access caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nGrinnell College's admission selectivity rating, according to The Princeton Review in 2025-26, is a 97 out of 99. This rating is determined by several institutionally reported factors, including: the class rank, average standardized test scores, and average high school GPA of entering freshmen; the percentage of students who hail from out-of-state; and the percentage of applicants accepted.\nGraduation rates.\nGrinnell College is oriented towards students being enrolled full-time in exactly eight consecutive semesters at the college, although exceptions are available for medical issues and other emergencies. To avoid being suspended from the college, students must make \"normal progress towards graduation\". This generally means that the student must pass at least 12 credits of classes in each individual semester, with grades C or higher, and have accumulated enough credits to make graduation possible at the end of four years, which requires an average of 15.5 credits each semester. A student who is not making normal progress towards graduation is placed on academic probation and may be dismissed from the college.\nNationwide, only 20% of college students complete a four-year undergraduate degree within four years, and only 57% of college students graduate within six years. However, at Grinnell College, 84% of students graduate within four years. This is the highest graduation rate of any college in Iowa.\nTuition and financial aid.\nThe sticker price for Grinnell's combined tuition, room, board, and fees for the 2022\u20132023 academic year is $76,528. Tuition and fees are $61,480 and room and board are $15,048.\nNeed-blind admissions and full financial aid.\nGrinnell College is one of a few dozen US colleges that maintain need-blind admissions and meets the full demonstrated financial need of all U.S. residents who are admitted to the college. Grinnell offers a large amount of need-based and merit-based aid in comparison with peer institutions. Currently (2020\u201321), 86% of students receive some form of financial aid. In 2018\u20132019, 20% of students enrolled at Grinnell College were receiving federal Pell Grants, which are generally reserved for students from low-income families. The average financial aid package is over $51,770. Grinnell guarantees a $10,000 Grinnell Choice Scholarship renewable for eight semesters to all U.S. citizens and permanent residents admitted under the Early Decision program.\nBeginning with the first-year students enrolled in the 2006\u20132007 school year, Grinnell ended its need-blind admissions policy for international applicants. Under the old policy, students from countries outside the U.S. were admitted without any consideration of their ability to afford four years of study at the college. However, financial aid offers to these students were limited to half the cost of tuition. International students frequently carried very high workloads in an effort to pay the bills, and their academic performance often suffered. Under the new \"need-sensitive\" or \"need-aware\" policy, international students whose demonstrated financial needs can be met are given a slight admissions edge over applicants who cannot. The twin hopes are that the enrolled international students will be able to dedicate more energy to their schoolwork, and also that this will ultimately allow the college to provide higher tuition grants to international students.\nPaid internships.\nIn addition to financial aid, students receive funding from the college for unpaid or underpaid summer internships and professional development (including international conferences and professional attire).\nStudent body.\nIn a 2014 study, compared to other US colleges with high four-year graduation rates, the economic diversity of students at Grinnell College was second only to Vassar College, indicating that it is accessible to students from low-income and middle-income families.\nGrinnell is unusual for a selective school based in a small town for being able to attract a relatively large number of international students and US students of color. About a quarter of students are people of color. Most students come from outside the Midwestern United States, and less than 10% are from Iowa.\nAthletics.\nThe school's varsity sports teams are named the Pioneers. They participate in eighteen intercollegiate sports at the NCAA Division III level and in the Midwest Conference. In addition, Grinnell has several club sports teams that compete in non-varsity sports such as volleyball, sailing, water polo, ultimate and rugby union.\nNearly one-third of recent Grinnell graduates participated in at least one of varsity sports while attending the college and the college has led the Midwest Conference in the total number of Academic All-Conference honorees in last four years (as of 2021).\nThe Grinnell Pioneers won the first game of intercollegiate football west of the Mississippi when they beat the University of Iowa 24\u20130 on November 16, 1889. A marker on Abe H. Rosenbloom Field, where Grinnell College's football team now plays, commemorates this victory.\nThe men's water polo team, known as the Wild Turkeys, were runners-up in the 2007 College Water Polo Association (CWPA) Division III Collegiate National Club Championships hosted by Lindenwood University in St. Charles, Missouri. They also qualified for the tournament in 2008, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2014. The Men's Ultimate team, nicknamed the Grinnellephants, qualified in 2008 for its first Division III National Championship in Versailles, Ohio. The Women's Ultimate team, nicknamed The Sticky Tongue Frogs, tied for third place in the 2010 Division III National Championship in Appleton, Wisconsin. The success was repeated in 2011 when the men's team placed third in 2011 Division III National Championship in Buffalo.\nIn February 2005, the Grinnell Pioneers men's basketball team became the first Division III school featured in a regular season basketball game by the ESPN network family in 30 years when it faced off against the Beloit Buccaneers on ESPN2. Grinnell lost 86\u201385. Grinnell College's basketball team attracted ESPN due to the team's run and gun style of playing basketball, known in Grinnell simply as \"The System\". Coach Dave Arseneault originated the Grinnell System that incorporates a continual full-court press, a fast-paced offense, an emphasis on offensive rebounding, a barrage of three-point shots and substitutions of five players at a time every 35 to 40 seconds. This allows a higher average playing time for more players than the \"starters\" and suits the Division III goals of scholar-athletes. \"The System\" has been criticized for not teaching the principles of defense. However, under \"The System\", Grinnell has won three conference championships over the past ten years and have regularly placed in the top half of the conference. Coach Arseneault's teams have set numerous NCAA scoring records and several individuals on the Grinnell team have led the nation in scoring or assists.\nOn November 19, 2011, Grinnell player Griffin Lentsch set a new Division III individual scoring record in a game against Principia College. The guard scored 89 points, besting the old record of 77, also set by a Pioneers player\u2014Jeff Clement\u2014in 1998. Lentsch made 27 of his 55 shots, including 15 three-pointers as Grinnell won the high-scoring game 145 to 97. On November 20, 2012, Grinnell's Jack Taylor broke Lentsch's scoring record, as well as the records for NCAA and collegiate scoring, in a 179\u2013104 victory over Faith Baptist Bible College. Taylor scored 138 points on 108 shots, along with 3 rebounds, 6 turnovers and 3 steals. Taylor went 27 for 71 from behind the arc. Taylor scored 109 points in a November 2013 game against Crossroads College to become the first player in NCAA history to have two 100-point games.\nIn 2019, the Grinnell women's volleyball team advanced to the NCAA Division III National Tournament for the first time in the 46-year history of the program, defeating St. Norbert College in a five-set thriller during the Midwest Conference Tournament championship match at Cornell College's gymnasium. It also marked Grinnell's first-ever MWC Tournament title in volleyball.\nSocial activities and organizations.\nStudents at Grinnell adhere to an honor system known as \"self-governance\" wherein they are expected to govern their own choices and behavior with minimal direct intervention by the college administration. By cultivating a community based on freedom of choice, self-governance aims to encourage students to become responsible, respectful, and accountable members of the campus, town, and global community.\nFounded in November 2000, the student-run group Pioneer Capital Investments (PCI), formerly known as Student Endowment Investing Group, actively invests over $100,000 of Grinnell College's endowment capital in public equities. The group's mission is to provide interested students with valuable experience for future careers in finance. Two environmental organizations on campus produce and sell custom notebooks, using leftover paper from classwork and reused pasteboard from boxes originally holding breakfast cereal or other products.\nService organizations are popular. The Alternative Break (\"AltBreak\") program takes students to pursue service initiatives during school holidays, and as of 2005, Grinnell had more alumni per capita serving in the Peace Corps than any other college in the nation. The college also runs its own post-graduation service program known as Grinnell Corps in Grinnell, China, Namibia, New Orleans, and Thailand, and has previously operated programs in Greece, Lesotho, Macau, and Nepal.\nUnion of Grinnell Student Dining Workers.\nIn 2016, students formed the Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers, or UGSDW, to represent student workers in the college's dining hall. It was the first undergraduate student workers union at a private college in the United States. After several years of legal maneuvers, the USGDW and the college agreed that the college would be neutral in elections and abide by the results.\nIn April 2022, members of the UGSDW voted 327\u20136 to expand the union to all hourly paid student workers on campus, which made Grinnell the first and only fully unionized student-worker body in the country. In October 2022, the union and the college began the collective bargaining process.\nNotable alumni.\nNotable alumni include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the scientific literature, there is a very strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.\nThe controversies are now primarily political rather than scientific, as there is a scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and is driven by human activities. Public debates that also reflect scientific debate include estimates of how responsive the climate system might be to any given level of greenhouse gases (climate sensitivity). Disputes over the key scientific facts of global warming are more prevalent in the media than in the scientific literature, where such issues are treated as resolved, and such disputes are more prevalent in the United States and Australia than globally.\nDebates around details in the science.\nThere have been many debates around the details of climate change science. Climate change deniers and \"skeptics\" tend to cherry-pick data or studies, and then trump up any scientific discussions or apparent discrepancies that match with their agenda. Many of those apparent discrepancies have been reconciled in the meantime, climate models have become more accurate, the scientific consensus on climate change has strengthened and so forth. For example, climatologist Kevin E. Trenberth has published widely on the topic of climate variability and has exposed flaws in the publications of other scientists.\nFor past debates and controversies on scientific details see for example:\nDebates over most effective response to warming.\nThere have been debates on the best responses to slow global warming, and their timing.

In statistics, Dantzig solved two open problems in statistical theory, which he had mistaken for homework after arriving late to a lecture by Polish mathematician-statistician Jerzy Sp\u0142awa-Neyman.\nAt his death, Dantzig was professor emeritus of Transportation Sciences and Professor of Operations Research and of Computer Science at Stanford University.\nEarly life.\nBorn to Jewish parents in Portland, Oregon, George Bernard Dantzig was named after George Bernard Shaw, the Irish writer. His father, Tobias Dantzig, was a mathematician and linguist, and his mother, Anja Dantzig (n\u00e9e Ourisson), was a Russian-born linguist of French-Lithuanian origin. Dantzig's parents met during their study at the University of Paris, where Tobias studied mathematics under Henri Poincar\u00e9, after whom Dantzig's brother was named. The Dantzigs emigrated to the United States, where they settled in Portland, Oregon.\nEarly in the 1920s the Dantzig family moved from Baltimore to Washington, D.C. His mother became a linguist at the Library of Congress, and his father became a math tutor at the University of Maryland, College Park.\nEducation.\nDantzig attended Powell Junior High School and Central High School. By the time he reached high school, he was already fascinated by geometry, and this interest was further nurtured by his father, challenging him with complicated problems, particularly in projective geometry.\nGeorge Dantzig received his B.S. from University of Maryland in 1936 in mathematics and physics. He earned his master's degree in mathematics from the University of Michigan in 1937. After working as a junior statistician at the Bureau of Labor Statistics from 1937 to 1939, he enrolled in the doctoral program in mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied statistics under Jerzy Sp\u0142awa-Neyman.\nDuring his study in 1939, Dantzig solved two unproven statistical theorems due to a misunderstanding. Near the beginning of a class, Professor Sp\u0142awa-Neyman wrote two problems on the blackboard. Dantzig arrived late and assumed that they were a homework assignment. According to Dantzig, they \"seemed to be a little harder than usual\", but a few days later he handed in completed solutions for both problems, still believing that they were an assignment that was overdue. Six weeks later, an excited Sp\u0142awa-Neyman eagerly told him that the \"homework\" problems he had solved were two of the most famous unsolved problems in statistics. He had prepared one of Dantzig's solutions for publication in a mathematical journal. This story began to spread and was used as a motivational lesson demonstrating the power of positive thinking. Over time, some facts were altered, but the basic story persisted in the form of an urban legend and as an introductory scene in the movie \"Good Will Hunting\".\nDantzig recalled in a 1986 interview in the \"College Mathematics Journal\", \"A year later, when I began to worry about a thesis topic, Sp\u0142awa-Neyman just shrugged and told me to wrap the two problems in a binder and he would accept them as my thesis.\"\nYears later, another researcher, Abraham Wald, was preparing to publish a paper where he had arrived at a conclusion for the second problem when he learned of Dantzig's earlier solution. When Dantzig suggested publishing jointly, Wald simply added Dantzig's name as co-author.\nCareer.\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Dantzig took a leave of absence from the doctoral program at Berkeley to work as a civilian for the United States Army Air Forces. From 1941 to 1946, he became the head of the combat analysis branch of the Headquarters Statistical Control for the Army Air Forces. In 1946, he returned to Berkeley to complete the requirements of his program and received his PhD that year. Although he had a faculty offer from Berkeley, he returned to the Air Force as mathematical advisor to the comptroller.\nIn 1952, Dantzig joined the mathematics division of the RAND Corporation. By 1960, he became a professor in the Department of Industrial Engineering at UC Berkeley, where he founded and directed the Operations Research Center. In 1966, he joined the Stanford faculty as Professor of Operations Research and of Computer Science. A year later, the Program in Operations Research became a full-fledged department. In 1973, he founded the Systems Optimization Laboratory (SOL) there. On a sabbatical leave that year, he managed the Methodology Group at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria. Later, he became the C. A. Criley Professor of Transportation Sciences at Stanford University.\nHe was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Dantzig was the recipient of many honors, including the first John von Neumann Theory Prize in 1974, the National Medal of Science in 1975, and an honorary doctorate from the University of Maryland, College Park in 1976. The Mathematical Programming Society honored Dantzig by creating the George B. Dantzig Prize, bestowed every three years since 1982 on one or two people who have made a significant impact in the field of mathematical programming. He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.\nResearch.\nFreund wrote further that \"through his research in mathematical theory, computation, economic analysis, and applications to industrial problems, Dantzig contributed more than any other researcher to the remarkable development of linear programming\".\nDantzig's work allows the airline industry, for example, to schedule crews and make fleet assignments. Based on his work, tools are developed \"that shipping companies use to determine how many planes they need and where their delivery trucks should be deployed. The oil industry long has used linear programming in refinery planning, as it determines how much of its raw product should become different grades of gasoline and how much should be used for petroleum-based byproducts. It is used in manufacturing, revenue management, telecommunications, advertising, architecture, circuit design and countless other areas\".\nLinear programming.\nLinear programming is a mathematical method for determining a way to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a given mathematical model for some list of requirements represented as linear relationships. Linear programming arose as a mathematical model developed during World War II to plan expenditures and returns in order to reduce costs to the army and increase losses to the enemy. It was kept secret until 1947. Postwar, many industries found its use in their daily planning.\nThe founders of this subject are Leonid Kantorovich, a Russian mathematician who developed linear programming problems in 1939, Dantzig, who published the simplex method in 1947, and John von Neumann, who developed the theory of the duality in the same year.\nDantzig was asked to work out a method the Air Force could use to improve their planning process. This led to his original example of finding the best assignment of 70 people to 70 jobs, showing the usefulness of linear programming. The computing power required to test all the permutations to select the best assignment is vast; the number of possible configurations exceeds the number of particles in the universe. However, it takes only a moment to find the optimum solution by posing the problem as a linear program and applying the Simplex algorithm. The theory behind linear programming drastically reduces the number of possible optimal solutions that must be checked.\nIn 1963, Dantzig's \"Linear Programming and Extensions\" was published by Princeton University Press. The book quickly became a standard text in linear programming.\nPersonal life.\nDantzig married Anne S. Shmuner in 1936. He died on May 13, 2005, in his home in Stanford, California, of complications from diabetes and cardiovascular disease. He was 90 years old. His children were named David, Paul, and Jessica. \nPresidential award.\nOn October 18, 1976, President Gerald Ford presented Dantzig with the National Medal of Science. The award was given \"For inventing linear programming and discovering methods that led to wide-scale scientific and technical applications to important problems in logistics, scheduling, and network optimization, and to the use of computers in making efficient use of the mathematical theory.\"\nPublications.\nBooks by George Dantzig:\nBook chapters:\nArticles, a selection:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ryman has written and published seven novels, including an early example of a hypertext novel, \"253\". He has won multiple awards, including the World Fantasy Award.\nBiography.\nRyman was born in Canada and moved to the United States at age 11. He earned degrees in History and English at UCLA, then moved to England in 1973, where he has lived most of his life. He is gay.\nIn addition to being an author, Ryman started a web design team for the UK government at the Central Office of Information in 1994. He also led the teams that designed the first official British Monarchy and 10 Downing Street websites, and worked on the UK government's flagship website, www.direct.gov.uk.\nWorks.\nRyman says he knew he was a writer \"before [he] could talk\", with his first work published in his mother's newspaper column at six years of age.\nHe is best known for his science fiction; however, his first novel was the fantasy \"The Warrior Who Carried Life\" (1985), and his revisionist fantasy of \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"Was...\" (1992), has been called \"his most accomplished work\".\nIn 1996, Ryman began publishing instalments of \"253: A Novel for the Internet in Seven Cars and a Crash\" on the web. The work deals with the interconnected lives of 253 people on a Bakerloo line train in London, hurtling towards death, and is an early example of a hypertext novel. It was deeply personal to Ryman. '253 happens on January 11th, 1995,' he writes, 'which is the day I learned my best friend was dying of Aids.' The project was intricate and lengthy, and took up a great deal of time, but in the 2000s, when Ryman was suffering from cancer, he accidentally failed to renew the URL, which was sold on, resulting in the loss of the project. In 2023, however, Ryman was able to restore it, and it became available online again.\nMuch of Ryman's work is based on travels to Cambodia. The first of these, \"\" (1986), was winner of the World Fantasy Award and BSFA Award. His novel \"The King's Last Song\" (2006) was set both in the Angkor Wat era and the time after Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge.\nIn 2023, after a significant hiatus between novels, Ryman published \"Him\", an alternative history of Jesus Christ, in which Jesus is born biologically female, but identifies as male. \"New Scientist\" called it 'provocative,' while Lisa Tuttle commented in \"The Guardian\": 'It will offend those determined to be offended, but it is a serious, heartfelt exploration of profound human questions by one of our best writers.'\nRyman has written, directed and performed in several plays based on works by other writers.\nHe was guest of honour at Novacon in 1989 and has twice been a guest speaker at Microcon, in 1994 and in 2004. He was also the guest of honour at the national Swedish science fiction convention Swecon in 2006, at Gaylaxicon 2008, at Wiscon 2009, and at \u00c5con 2010. An article by Wendy Gay Pearson on Ryman's novel \"The Child Garden\" won the British Science Fiction Foundation's graduate essay award and was published in a special issue of \"Foundation\" on LGBT science fiction edited by Andrew M. Butler in 2002. Ryman's works were also the subject of a special issue of \"Extrapolation\" in 2008, with articles dealing with \"Air, The Child Garden, Lust,\" and \"Was,\" in particular. Neil Easterbrook's article in this special issue, \"'Giving An Account of Oneself': Ethics, Alterity, Air\" won the 2009 Science Fiction Research Association Pioneer Award for best published article on science fiction (this award has since been renamed the SFRA Innovative Research Award). The issue includes an interview with Geoff Ryman by Canadian speculative fiction writer Hiromi Goto. The introduction to the special issue, by Susan Knabe and Wendy Gay Pearson, also responds to Ryman's call for Mundane science fiction.\nThe Mundane SF movement was founded in 2002 during the Clarion Workshop by Ryman and other Clarion West Workshop instructors. In a 2004 manifesto on the subject, Ryman writes of the Mundane science fiction movement: 'This movement proposes \"mundane science fiction\" as its own subgenre science fiction, typically characterized by its setting on Earth and a believable use of technology and science as it exists at the time the story is written or a plausible extension of existing technology.'\nIn 2008 a Mundane SF issue of \"Interzone\" magazine was published, guest-edited by Ryman, Julian Todd and Trent Walters.\nRyman has lectured at the University of Manchester since at least 2007; as of 2022 he is an Honorary Senior Lecturer in Creative Writing for University of Manchester's English Department, where in 2011 he won the Faculty Students' Teaching Award for the School of Arts, History and Culture.\nAwards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13115", "revid": "1750837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13115", "title": "Gametophyte", "text": "Haploid stage in the life cycle of plants and algae\nA gametophyte () is one of the two alternating multicellular phases in the life cycles of plants and algae. It is a haploid multicellular organism that develops from a haploid spore, that has one set of chromosomes. The gametophyte is the sexual phase in the life cycle of plants and algae. It develops sex organs that produce gametes, haploid sex cells that participate in fertilization to form a diploid zygote, which has a double set of chromosomes. Cell division of the zygote results in a new diploid multicellular organism, the second stage in the life cycle known as the sporophyte. The sporophyte can produce haploid spores by meiosis that on germination produce a new generation of gametophytes.\nAlgae.\nIn some multicellular green algae (\"Ulva lactuca\" is one example), red algae and brown algae, sporophytes and gametophytes may be externally indistinguishable (isomorphic). In \"Ulva\", the gametes are isogamous, all of one size, shape and general morphology.\nLand plants.\nIn land plants, anisogamy is universal. As in animals, female and male gametes are called, respectively, \"eggs\" and \"sperm.\" In extant land plants, either the sporophyte or the gametophyte may be reduced (heteromorphic). No extant gametophytes have stomata, but they have been found on fossil species like the early Devonian \"Aglaophyton\" from the Rhynie chert. Other fossil gametophytes found in the Rhynie chert shows they were much more developed than present forms, resembling the sporophyte in having a well-developed conducting strand, a cortex, an epidermis and a cuticle with stomata, but were much smaller.\nBryophytes.\nIn bryophytes (mosses, liverworts, and hornworts), the gametophyte is the most visible stage of the life cycle. The bryophyte gametophyte is longer lived, nutritionally independent, and the sporophytes are attached to the gametophytes and dependent on them. When a moss spore germinates it grows to produce a filament of cells (called the protonema). The mature gametophyte of mosses develops into leafy shoots that produce sex organs (gametangia) that produce gametes. Eggs develop in archegonia and sperm in antheridia.\nIn some bryophyte groups such as many liverworts of the order Marchantiales, the gametes are produced on specialized structures called gametophores (or gametangiophores).\nVascular plants.\nAll vascular plants are sporophyte dominant, and a trend toward smaller and more sporophyte-dependent female gametophytes is evident as land plants evolved reproduction by seeds.\nThose vascular plants, such as clubmosses and many ferns, that produce only one type of spore are said to be homosporous. They have exosporic gametophytes \u2014 that is, the gametophyte is free-living and develops outside of the spore wall. Exosporic gametophytes can either be bisexual, capable of producing both sperm and eggs in the same thallus (monoicous), or specialized into separate male and female organisms (dioicous).\nIn heterosporous vascular plants (plants that produce both microspores and megaspores), the gametophytes develop endosporically (within the spore wall). These gametophytes are dioicous, producing either sperm or eggs but not both.\nFerns.\nIn most ferns, for example, in the leptosporangiate fern \"Dryopteris\", the gametophyte is a photosynthetic free living autotrophic organism called a prothallus that produces gametes and maintains the sporophyte during its early multicellular development. However, in some groups, notably the clade that includes Ophioglossaceae and Psilotaceae, the gametophytes are subterranean and subsist by forming mycotrophic relationships with fungi. Homosporous ferns secrete a chemical called antheridiogen.\nLycophytes.\nExtant lycophytes produce two different types of gametophytes. In the homosporous families Lycopodiaceae and Huperziaceae, spores germinate into bisexual free-living, subterranean and mycotrophic gametophytes that derive nutrients from symbiosis with fungi. In \"Isoetes\" and \"Selaginella\", which are heterosporous, microspores and megaspores are dispersed from sporangia either passively or by active ejection. Microspores produce microgametophytes which produce sperm. Megaspores produce reduced megagametophytes inside the spore wall. At maturity, the megaspore cracks open at the trilete suture to allow the male gametes to access the egg cells in the archegonia inside. The gametophytes of \"Isoetes\" appear to be similar in this respect to those of the extinct Carboniferous arborescent lycophytes \"Lepidodendron\" and \"Lepidostrobus\".\nSeed plants.\nThe seed plant (spermatophyte) gametophyte life cycle is even more reduced than in basal taxa (ferns and lycophytes). Seed plant gametophytes are not independent organisms and depend upon the dominant sporophyte tissue for nutrients and water. With the exception of mature pollen, if the gametophyte tissue is separated from the sporophyte tissue it will not survive. Due to this complex relationship and the small size of the gametophyte tissue\u2014in some situations single celled\u2014differentiating with the human eye or even a microscope between seed plant gametophyte tissue and sporophyte tissue can be a challenge. While seed plant gametophyte tissue is typically composed of mononucleate haploid cells (1 x n), specific circumstances can occur in which the ploidy does vary widely despite still being considered part of the gametophyte.\nIn gymnosperms, the male gametophytes are produced inside microspores within the microsporangia located inside male cones or microstrobili. In each microspore, a single gametophyte is produced, consisting of four haploid cells produced by meiotic division of a diploid microspore mother cell. At maturity, each microspore-derived gametophyte becomes a pollen grain. During its development, the water and nutrients that the male gametophyte requires are provided by the sporophyte tissue until they are released for pollination. The cell number of each mature pollen grain varies between the gymnosperm orders. Cycadophyta have 3 celled pollen grains while Ginkgophyta have 4 celled pollen grains. Gnetophyta may have 2 or 3 celled pollen grains depending on the species, and Coniferophyta pollen grains vary greatly ranging from single celled to 40 celled. One of these cells is typically a germ cell and other cells may consist of a single tube cell which grows to form the pollen tube, sterile cells, and/or prothallial cells which are both vegetative cells without an essential reproductive function. After pollination is successful, the male gametophyte continues to develop. If a tube cell was not developed in the microstrobilus, one is created after pollination via mitosis. The tube cell grows into the diploid tissue of the female cone and may branch out into the megastrobilus tissue or grow straight towards the egg cell. The megastrobilus sporophytic tissue provides nutrients for the male gametophyte at this stage. In some gymnosperms, the tube cell will create a direct channel from the site of pollination to the egg cell, in other gymnosperms, the tube cell will rupture in the middle of the megastrobilus sporophyte tissue. This occurs because in some gymnosperm orders, the germ cell is nonmobile and a direct pathway is needed, however, in Cycadophyta and Ginkgophyta, the germ cell is mobile due to flagella being present and a direct tube cell path from the pollination site to the egg is not needed. In most species the germ cell can be more specifically described as a sperm cell which mates with the egg cell during fertilization, though that is not always the case. In some Gnetophyta species, the germ cell will release two sperm nuclei that undergo a rare gymnosperm double fertilization process occurring solely with sperm nuclei and not with the fusion of developed cells. After fertilization is complete in all orders, the remaining male gametophyte tissue will deteriorate.\nThe female gametophyte in gymnosperms differs from the male gametophyte as it spends its whole life cycle in one organ, the ovule located inside the megastrobilus or female cone. Similar to the male gametophyte, the female gametophyte normally is fully dependent on the surrounding sporophytic tissue for nutrients and the two organisms cannot be separated. However, the female gametophytes of \"Ginkgo biloba\" do contain chlorophyll and can produce some of their own energy, though, not enough to support itself without being supplemented by the sporophyte. The female gametophyte forms from a diploid megaspore that undergoes meiosis and starts being singled celled. The size of the mature female gametophyte varies drastically between gymnosperm orders. In Cycadophyta, Ginkgophyta, Coniferophyta, and some Gnetophyta, the single celled female gametophyte undergoes many cycles of mitosis ending up consisting of thousands of cells once mature. At a minimum, two of these cells are egg cells and the rest are haploid somatic cells, but more egg cells may be present and their ploidy, though typically haploid, may vary. In select Gnetophyta, the female gametophyte stays singled celled. Mitosis does occur, but no cell divisions are ever made. This results in the mature female gametophyte in some Gnetophyta having many free nuclei in one cell. Once mature, this single celled gametophyte is 90% smaller than the female gametophytes in other gymnosperm orders. After fertilization, the remaining female gametophyte tissue in gymnosperms serves as the nutrient source for the developing zygote (even in Gnetophyta where the diploid zygote cell is much smaller at that stage, and for a while lives within the single celled gametophyte).\nThe precursor to the male angiosperm gametophyte is a diploid microspore mother cell located inside the anther. Once the microspore undergoes meiosis, 4 haploid cells are formed, each of which is a singled celled male gametophyte. The male gametophyte will develop via one or two rounds of mitosis inside the anther. This creates a 2 or 3 celled male gametophyte which becomes known as the pollen grain once dehiscing occurs. One cell is the tube cell, and the remaining cell/cells are the sperm cells. The development of the three celled male gametophyte prior to dehiscing has evolved multiple times and is present in about a third of angiosperm species allowing for faster fertilization after pollination. Once pollination occurs, the tube cell grows in size and if the male gametophyte is only 2 cells at this stage, the single sperm cell undergoes mitosis to create a second sperm cell. Just like in gymnosperms, the tube cell in angiosperms obtains nutrients from the sporophytic tissue, and may branch out into the pistil tissue or grow directly towards the ovule. Once double fertilization is completed, the tube cell and other vegetative cells, if present, are all that remains of the male gametophyte and soon degrade.\nThe female gametophyte of angiosperms develops in the ovule (located inside the female or hermaphrodite flower). Its precursor is a diploid megaspore that undergoes meiosis which produces four haploid daughter cells. Three of these independent gametophyte cells degenerate and the one that remains is the gametophyte mother cell which normally contains one nucleus. In general, it will then divide by mitosis until it consists of 8 nuclei separated into 1 egg cell, 3 antipodal cells, 2 synergid cells, and a central cell that contains two nuclei. In select angiosperms, special cases occur in which the female gametophyte is not 7 celled with 8 nuclei. On the small end of the spectrum, some species have mature female gametophytes with only 4 cells, each with one nuclei. Conversely, some species have 10-celled mature female gametophytes consisting of 16 total nuclei. Once double fertilization occurs, the egg cell becomes the zygote which is then considered sporophyte tissue. Scholars still disagree on whether the fertilized central cell is considered gametophyte tissue. Some botanists consider this endospore as gametophyte tissue with typically 2/3 being female and 1/3 being male, but as the central cell before double fertilization can range from 1n to 8n in special cases, the fertilized central cells range from 2n (50% male/female) to 9n (1/9 male, 8/9th female). However, other botanists consider the fertilized endospore as sporophyte tissue. Some believe it is neither.\nHeterospory.\nIn heterosporic plants, there are two distinct kinds of gametophytes. Because the two gametophytes differ in form and function, they are termed \"heteromorphic\", from \"hetero\"- \"different\" and \"morph\" \"form\". The egg-producing gametophyte is known as a megagametophyte, because it is typically larger, and the sperm producing gametophyte is known as a microgametophyte. Species which produce egg and sperm on separate gametophytes plants are termed dioicous, while those that produce both eggs and sperm on the same gametophyte are termed monoicous.\nIn heterosporous plants (water ferns, some lycophytes, as well as all gymnosperms and angiosperms), there are two distinct types of sporangia, each of which produces a single kind of spore that germinates to produce a single kind of gametophyte. However, not all heteromorphic gametophytes come from heterosporous plants. That is, some plants have distinct egg-producing and sperm-producing gametophytes, but these gametophytes develop from the same kind of spore inside the same sporangium; \"Sphaerocarpos\" is an example of such a plant.\nIn seed plants, the microgametophyte is called pollen. Seed plant microgametophytes consists of several (typically two to five) cells when the pollen grains exit the sporangium. The megagametophyte develops within the megaspore of extant seedless vascular plants and within the megasporangium in a cone or flower in seed plants. In seed plants, the microgametophyte (pollen) travels to the vicinity of the egg cell (carried by a physical or animal vector) and produces two sperm by mitosis.\nIn gymnosperms, the megagametophyte consists of several thousand cells and produces one to several archegonia, each with a single egg cell. The gametophyte becomes a food storage tissue in the seed.\nIn angiosperms, the megagametophyte is reduced to only a few cells, and is sometimes called the embryo sac. A typical embryo sac contains seven cells and eight nuclei, one of which is the egg cell. Two nuclei fuse with a sperm nucleus to form the primary endospermic nucleus which develops to form triploid endosperm, which becomes the food storage tissue in the seed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was the first Italian woman to receive the prize, and only the second woman in general after Selma Lagerl\u00f6f was awarded hers in 1909.\nBiography.\nDeledda was born in Nuoro, Sardinia, into a middle-class family, to Giovanni Antonio Deledda and Francesca Cambosu, as the fourth of seven siblings. She attended elementary school (the minimum required at the time) and was then educated by a private tutor (a guest of one of her relatives) and moved on to study literature on her own. It was during this time that she started displaying an interest in writing short novels, mostly inspired by the life of Sardinian peasants and their struggles. Her teacher encouraged her to submit her writing to a newspaper and, at age 13, her first story was published in a local journal. Some of Deledda's early works were published in the fashion magazine \"L'ultima moda\" between 1888 and 1889. In 1890 Trevisani published \"Nell'azzurro\" (Into the Blue), her first collection of short stories. Deledda's main focus was the representation of poverty and the struggles associated with it through a combination of imaginary and autobiographical elements. Her family wasn't particularly supportive of her desire to write.\nDeledda's first novel, \"Fiori di Sardegna\" (Flowers of Sardinia) was published in 1892. Her 1896 book \"Paesaggi sardi\", published by Speirani, is characterized by a prose both informed by fiction and poetry. Around this time Deledda initiated a regular collaboration with newspapers and magazines, most notably \"La Sardegna\", \"Piccola Rivista\" and \"Nuova Antologia\". Her work earned significant visibility as well as critical interest. In October 1899, Deledda met Palmiro Madesani, a functionary of the Ministry of Finance, in Cagliari. Madesani and Deledda were married in 1900 and the couple moved to Rome right after the publication of Deledda's \"Il vecchio della montagna\" (The Old Man from the Mountain, 1900). Despite the birth of her two sons, Sardus (1901) and Francesco \"Franz\" (1904), Deledda managed to continue to write prolifically, publishing about a novel a year.\nIn 1903 she published \"Elias Portolu\", which was met with commercial and critical success, boosting her reputation as a writer. This was followed by \"Cenere\" (Ashes, 1904); \"L'edera\" (The Ivy, 1908); \"Sino al confine\" (To the Border, 1910); \"Colombi e sparvieri\" (Doves and Sparrows, 1912); and her most popular book, \"Canne al vento\" (Reeds in the Wind, 1913).\nIn 1916 \"Cenere\" was the inspiration for a silent movie with famed Italian actress Eleonora Duse. It was the first and only time that Duse, a theatre performer, appeared in a film. Deledda was one of the contributors of the nationalist women's magazine, \"Lidel\", which was established in 1919.\nIn 1926 Henrik Sch\u00fcck, a member of the Swedish Academy, nominated Deledda for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Deledda won \"for her idealistically inspired writings which with plastic clarity picture the life on her native island and with depth and sympathy deal with human problems in general.\" She was awarded the Prize in a ceremony in Stockholm in 1926. Her initial response to the news was \"Gi\u00e0?\" (\"Already?\")\nDeledda's win contributed to an increase in popularity of her writing. Benito Mussolini, who had just consolidated his grip on power, sent Deledda a signed portrait of himself with a dedication where he expressed his \"profound admiration\" for the writer. Flocks of journalists and photographers started visiting her home in Rome. Deledda initially welcomed them but eventually grew tired of the attention. One day she noticed that her beloved pet crow, Checca, was visibly irritated by the commotion, with people constantly coming in and out of the house. \"If Checca has had enough, so have I,\" Deledda was quoted as saying, and she returned to a more retired routine.\nThe events also put a strain on Deledda's extremely methodical writings schedule. Her day would start with a late breakfast, followed by a morning of hard reading, lunch, a quick nap and a few hours of writing before dinner.\nDeledda continued to write even as she grew older and more fragile. Her subsequent works, \"La Casa del Poeta\" (The House of the Poet, 1930) and \"Sole d'Estate\" (Summer Sun, 1933), indicate a more optimistic view of life even as she was experiencing serious health issues.\nDeledda died in Rome at the age of 64 of breast cancer. \"La chiesa della solitudine\" (The Church of Solitude, 1936), Deledda's last novel, is a semi-autobiographical depiction of a young Italian woman coming to terms with a fatal disease. A completed manuscript of the novel \"Cosima\" was discovered after her death and published posthumously in 1937.\nAccolades.\nDeledda's work has been highly regarded by writers of Italian literature, including Luigi Capuana, Giovanni Verga, Enrico Thovez, Pietro Pancrazi, Renato Serra. Sardinian writers including Sergio Atzeni, Giulio Angioni and Salvatore Mannuzzu, were greatly influenced by her work, prompting them to found what has later become known as the Sardinian Literary Spring. In 1947 artist Amelia Camboni was commissioned a portrait of Deledda, currently standing close to her home in Rome in the Pincio neighbourhood.\nDeledda's birthplace and childhood home in Nuoro was declared a national heritage building and purchased in 1968 by the Municipality of Nuoro, which in 1979 handed it over to the Regional Ethnographic Institute (ISRE) for the symbolic price of 1,000 Italian Lire. The Institute transformed the house into a museum commemorating the writer, and it's now called the Museo Deleddiano. The museum consists of ten rooms showcasing the most important episodes in Deledda's life.\nA coal power plant opened in Portoscuso in 1965. As of 2013[ [update]], this powerplant called Grazia Deledda has a capacity of 590 MW.\nOn 10 December 2017 Google celebrated her with a Google Doodle.\nWork.\nThe life, customs, and traditions of the Sardinian people are prominent in Deledda's writing. She often relies on detailed geographical descriptions and her characters often present a strong connection with their place of origins. Many of her characters are outcasts who silently struggle with isolation. Overall Deledda's work focuses on love, pain and death, upon which rest feelings of sin and fatality. Her novels tend to criticize social values and moral norms rather than the people who are victims of such circumstances.\nIn her work the influence of the verism of Giovanni Verga and, sometimes, also that of the decadentism of Gabriele D'Annunzio is evident, although her writing style is not so ornate. Despite her groundbreaking role in Italian and world literature, Deledda has not been considered a feminist writer, possibly due to her tendency to depict women's pain and suffering as opposed to women's autonomy.\nComplete list of works.\nBelow is a complete list of Deledda's works:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nVoice recording.\nThe voice of Grazia Deledda speaking (in Italian) at the Nobel Prize Ceremony in 1926."}

Seaborg", "text": "American chemist (1912\u20131999)\nGlenn Theodore Seaborg ( ; April 19, 1912\u00a0\u2013 February 25, 1999) was an American chemist whose involvement in the synthesis, discovery and investigation of ten transuranium elements earned him a share of the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. His work in this area also led to his development of the actinide concept and the arrangement of the actinide series in the periodic table of the elements.\nSeaborg spent most of his career as an educator and research scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, serving as a professor, and, between 1958 and 1961, as the university's second chancellor. He advised ten US presidents\u2014from Harry S. Truman to Bill Clinton\u2014on nuclear policy and was Chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission from 1961 to 1971, where he pushed for commercial nuclear energy and the peaceful applications of nuclear science. Throughout his career, Seaborg worked for arms control. He was a signatory to the Franck Report and contributed to the Limited Test Ban Treaty, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. He was a well-known advocate of science education and federal funding for pure research. Toward the end of the Eisenhower administration, he was the principal author of the Seaborg Report on academic science, and, as a member of President Ronald Reagan's National Commission on Excellence in Education, he was a key contributor to its 1983 report \"A Nation at Risk\".\nSeaborg was the principal or co-discoverer of ten elements: plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium and element 106, which, while he was still living, was named seaborgium in his honor. He said about this naming, \"This is the greatest honor ever bestowed upon me\u2014even better, I think, than winning the Nobel Prize. Future students of chemistry, in learning about the periodic table, may have reason to ask why the element was named for me, and thereby learn more about my work.\" He also discovered more than 100 isotopes of transuranium elements and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium, originally as part of the Manhattan Project where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the plutonium fuel for the implosion-type atomic bomb. Early in his career, he was a pioneer in nuclear medicine and discovered isotopes of elements with important applications in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, including iodine-131, which is used in the treatment of thyroid disease. In addition to his theoretical work in the development of the actinide concept, which placed the actinide series beneath the lanthanide series on the periodic table, he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the transactinide and superactinide series.\nAfter sharing the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Edwin McMillan, he received approximately 50 honorary doctorates and numerous other awards and honors. The list of things named after Seaborg ranges from the chemical element seaborgium to the asteroid 4856 Seaborg. He was the author of numerous books and 500 journal articles, often in collaboration with others. He was once listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the person with the longest entry in \"Who's Who in America\".\nEarly life.\nGlenn Theodore Seaborg was born in Ishpeming, Michigan, on April 19, 1912, the son of Herman Theodore (Ted) and Selma Olivia Erickson Seaborg. He had one sister, Jeanette, who was two years younger. His family spoke Swedish at home. When Glenn Seaborg was a boy, the family moved to Los Angeles County, California, settling in a subdivision called Home Gardens, later annexed to the City of South Gate, California. About this time he changed the spelling of his first name from Glen to Glenn.\nSeaborg kept a daily journal from 1927 until he suffered a stroke in 1998. As a youth, Seaborg was both a devoted sports fan and an avid movie buff. His mother encouraged him to become a bookkeeper as she felt his literary interests were impractical. He did not take an interest in science until his junior year when he was inspired by Dwight Logan Reid, a chemistry and physics teacher at David Starr Jordan High School in Watts.\nSeaborg graduated from Jordan in 1929 at the top of his class and received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in chemistry at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1933. He worked his way through school as a stevedore and a laboratory assistant at Firestone. Seaborg received his PhD in chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1937 with a doctoral thesis on the \"Interaction of Fast Neutrons with Lead\", in which he coined the term \"nuclear spallation\".\nSeaborg was a member of the professional chemistry fraternity Alpha Chi Sigma. As a graduate student in the 1930s Seaborg performed wet chemistry research for his advisor Gilbert Newton Lewis, and published three papers with him on the theory of acids and bases. Seaborg studied the text \"Applied Radiochemistry\" by Otto Hahn, of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin, and it had a major impact on his developing interests as a research scientist. For several years, Seaborg conducted important research in artificial radioactivity using the Lawrence cyclotron at UC Berkeley. He was excited to learn from others that nuclear fission was possible\u2014but also chagrined, as his own research might have led him to the same discovery.\nSeaborg also became an adept interlocutor of Berkeley physicist Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer had a daunting reputation and often answered a junior colleague's question before it had even been stated. Often the question answered was more profound than the one asked, but of little practical help. Seaborg learned to state his questions to Oppenheimer quickly and succinctly.\nPioneering work in nuclear chemistry.\nSeaborg remained at the University of California, Berkeley, for post-doctoral research. He followed Frederick Soddy's work investigating isotopes and contributed to the discovery of more than 100 isotopes of elements. Using one of Lawrence's advanced cyclotrons, John Livingood, Fred Fairbrother, and Seaborg created a new isotope of iron, iron-59 in 1937. Iron-59 was useful in the studies of the hemoglobin in human blood. In 1938, Livingood and Seaborg collaborated (as they did for five years) to create an important isotope of iodine, iodine-131, which is still used to treat thyroid disease. (Many years later, it was credited with prolonging the life of Seaborg's mother.) As a result of these and other contributions, Seaborg is regarded as a pioneer in nuclear medicine and is one of its most prolific discoverers of isotopes.\nIn 1939 he became an instructor in chemistry at Berkeley, was promoted to assistant professor in 1941 and professor in 1945. University of California, Berkeley, physicist Edwin McMillan led a team that discovered element 93, which he named neptunium in 1940. In November, he was persuaded to leave Berkeley temporarily to assist with urgent research in radar technology. Since Seaborg and his colleagues had perfected McMillan's oxidation-reduction technique for isolating neptunium, he asked McMillan for permission to continue the research and search for element 94. McMillan agreed to the collaboration. Seaborg first reported alpha decay proportionate to only a fraction of the element 93 under observation. The first hypothesis for this alpha particle accumulation was contamination by uranium, which produces alpha-decay particles; analysis of alpha-decay particles ruled this out. Seaborg then postulated that a distinct alpha-producing element was being formed from element 93.\nIn February 1941, Seaborg and his collaborators produced plutonium-239 through the bombardment of uranium. In their experiments bombarding uranium with deuterons, they observed the creation of neptunium, element 93. But it then underwent beta-decay, forming a new element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Plutonium is fairly stable, but undergoes alpha-decay, which explained the presence of alpha particles coming from neptunium. Thus, on March 28, 1941, Seaborg, physicist Emilio Segr\u00e8 and Berkeley chemist Joseph W. Kennedy were able to show that plutonium (then known only as element 94) was fissile, an important distinction that was crucial to the decisions made in directing Manhattan Project research. In 1966, Room 307 of Gilman Hall on the campus at the Berkeley, where Seaborg did his work, was declared a US National Historic Landmark.\nIn addition to plutonium, he is credited as a lead discoverer of americium, curium, and berkelium, and as a co-discoverer of californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium and seaborgium, the first element named after a living person. He shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1951 with Edwin McMillan for \"their discoveries in the chemistry of the first transuranium elements.\"\nScientific contributions during the Manhattan Project.\nOn April 19, 1942, Seaborg reached Chicago and joined the chemistry group at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago, where Enrico Fermi and his group would later convert uranium-238 to plutonium-239 in a controlled nuclear chain reaction. Seaborg's role was to figure out how to extract the tiny bit of plutonium from the mass of uranium. Plutonium-239 was isolated in visible amounts using a transmutation reaction on August 20, 1942, and weighed on September 10, 1942, in Seaborg's Chicago laboratory. He was responsible for the multi-stage chemical process that separated, concentrated and isolated plutonium. This process was further developed at the Clinton Engineering Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and then entered full-scale production at the Hanford Engineer Works, in Richland, Washington.\nSeaborg's theoretical development of the actinide concept resulted in a redrawing of the periodic table into its current configuration with the actinide series appearing below the lanthanide series. Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and curium while in Chicago. He managed to secure patents for both elements. His patent on curium never proved commercially viable because of the element's short half-life, but americium is commonly used in household smoke detectors and thus provided a good source of royalty income to Seaborg in later years. Prior to the test of the first nuclear weapon, Seaborg joined with several other leading scientists in a written statement known as the Franck Report (secret at the time but since published) unsuccessfully calling on President Truman to conduct a public demonstration of the atomic bomb witnessed by the Japanese.\nProfessor and Chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley.\nAfter the conclusion of World War II and the Manhattan Project, Seaborg was eager to return to academic life and university research free from the restrictions of wartime secrecy. In 1946, he added to his responsibilities as a professor by heading the nuclear chemistry research at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory operated by the University of California on behalf of the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Seaborg was named one of the \"Ten Outstanding Young Men in America\" by the US Junior Chamber of Commerce in 1947 (along with Richard Nixon and others). Seaborg was elected a Member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1948. From 1954 to 1961 he served as associate director of the radiation laboratory. He was appointed by President Truman to serve as a member of the General Advisory Committee of the AEC, an assignment he retained until 1960.\nSeaborg served as chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1958 to 1961. His term coincided with a relaxation of McCarthy-era restrictions on students' freedom of expression that had begun under his predecessor, Clark Kerr. In October 1958, Seaborg announced that the university had relaxed its prior prohibitions on political activity on a trial basis, and the ban on communists speaking on campus was lifted. This paved the way for the Free Speech Movement of 1964\u201365.\nSeaborg was an enthusiastic supporter of Cal's sports teams. San Francisco columnist Herb Caen was fond of pointing out that Seaborg's surname is an anagram of \"Go Bears\", a popular cheer at UC Berkeley. Seaborg was proud of the fact that the Cal Bears won their first and only National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball championship in 1959, while he was chancellor. The football team also won the conference title and played in the Rose Bowl that year. He served on the Faculty Athletic Committee for several years and was the co-author of a book, \"Roses from the Ashes: Breakup and Rebirth in Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Athletics\" (2000), concerning the Pacific Coast Conference recruiting scandal, and the founding of what is now the Pac-12, in which he played a role in restoring confidence in the integrity of collegiate sports.\nSeaborg served on the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) during the Eisenhower administration. PSAC produced a report on \"Scientific Progress, the Universities, and the Federal Government\", also known as the \"Seaborg Report\", in November 1960, that urged greater federal funding of science. In 1959, he helped found the Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory with Clark Kerr.\nChairman of the Atomic Energy Commission.\nAfter appointment by President John F. Kennedy and confirmation by the United States Senate, Seaborg was chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) from 1961 to 1971. His pending appointment by President-elect Kennedy was nearly derailed in late 1960 when members of the Kennedy transition team learned that Seaborg had been listed in a \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" article as a member of \"Nixon's Idea Men\". Seaborg said that as a lifetime Democrat he was baffled when the article appeared associating him with outgoing Vice President Richard Nixon, a Republican whom Seaborg considered a casual acquaintance.\nDuring the early 1960s, Seaborg became concerned with the ecological and biological effects of nuclear weapons, especially those that would impact human life significantly. In response, he commissioned the Technical Analysis Branch of the AEC to study these matters further. Seaborg's provision for these innovative studies led the US Government to more seriously pursue the development and possible use of \"clean\" nuclear weapons.\nWhile chairman of the AEC, Seaborg participated on the negotiating team for the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT), in which the US, UK, and USSR agreed to ban all above-ground test detonations of nuclear weapons. Seaborg considered his contributions to the achievement of the LTBT as one of his greatest accomplishments. Despite strict rules from the Soviets about photography at the signing ceremony, Seaborg used a tiny camera to take a close-up photograph of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev as he signed the treaty.\nSeaborg enjoyed a close relationship with President Lyndon Johnson and influenced the administration to pursue the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Seaborg was called to the White House in the first week of the Nixon Administration in January 1969 to advise President Richard Nixon on his first diplomatic crisis involving the Soviets and nuclear testing. He clashed with Nixon presidential adviser John Ehrlichman over the treatment of a Jewish scientist, Zalman Shapiro, whom the Nixon administration suspected of leaking nuclear secrets to Israel.\nSeaborg published several books and journal articles during his tenure at the AEC. He predicted the existence of elements beyond those on the periodic table, the transactinide series and the superactinide series of undiscovered synthetic elements. While most of these theoretical future elements have extremely short half-lives and thus no expected practical applications, he also hypothesized the existence of stable super-heavy isotopes of certain elements in an island of stability. Seaborg served as chairman of the AEC until 1971.\nReturn to California.\nFollowing his service as Chairman of the AEC, Seaborg returned to UC Berkeley where he was awarded the position of University Professor. At the time, there had been fewer University Professors at UC Berkeley than Nobel Prize winners. He also served as Chairman of the Lawrence Hall of Science where he became the principal investigator for Great Explorations in Math and Science (GEMS) working with director Jacqueline Barber. Seaborg served as chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1958 to 1961, and served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1972 and as president of the American Chemical Society in 1976.\nIn 1980, he transmuted several thousand atoms of bismuth-209 into gold (197Au) at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. His experimental technique, using the lab's Bevalac particle accelerator, was able to remove protons and neutrons from the bismuth atoms by bombarding it with carbon and neon nuclei traveling near the speed of light. Seaborg's technique would have been far too expensive to enable routine manufacturing of gold, but his work was close to the mythical Philosopher's Stone. As gold has four fewer protons and (taking the only naturally occurring bulk isotopes of either) eight fewer neutrons than bismuth, a total of twelve nucleons have to be removed from the bismuth nucleus to produce gold using Seaborg's method.\nIn 1981, Seaborg became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.\nIn 1983, President Ronald Reagan appointed Seaborg to serve on the National Commission on Excellence in Education. The commission produced a report \"A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform\", which focused national attention on education as a national issue germane to the federal government. In 2008, Margaret Spellings wrote that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"A Nation at Risk\" delivered a wake up call for our education system. It described stark realities like a significant number of functionally illiterate high schoolers, plummeting student performance, and international competitors breathing down our necks. It was a warning, a reproach, and a call to arms.\nSeaborg lived most of his later life in Lafayette, California, where he devoted himself to editing and publishing the journals that documented both his early life and later career. He rallied a group of scientists who criticized the science curriculum in the state of California, which he viewed as far too socially oriented and not nearly focused enough on hard science. California Governor Pete Wilson appointed Seaborg to head a committee that proposed changes to California's science curriculum despite outcries from labor organizations and others.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1942, Seaborg married Helen Griggs, the secretary of physicist Ernest Lawrence. Under wartime pressure, Seaborg had moved to Chicago while engaged to Griggs. When Seaborg returned to accompany Griggs for the journey back to Chicago, friends expected them to marry in Chicago. But, eager to be married, Seaborg and Griggs impulsively got off the train in the town of Caliente, Nevada, for what they thought would be a quick wedding. When they asked for City Hall, they found Caliente had none\u2014they would have to travel north to Pioche, the county seat. With no car, this was no easy feat, but one of Caliente's newest deputy sheriffs turned out to be a recent graduate of the Cal Berkeley chemistry department and was more than happy to do a favor for Seaborg. The deputy sheriff arranged for the wedding couple to ride up and back to Pioche in a mail truck. The witnesses at the Seaborg wedding were a clerk and a janitor. Glenn Seaborg and Helen Griggs Seaborg had seven children, of whom the first, Peter Glenn Seaborg, died in 1997 (his twin Paulette having died in infancy). The others were Lynne Seaborg Cobb, David Seaborg, Steve Seaborg, Eric Seaborg, and Dianne Seaborg.\nSeaborg was an avid hiker. Upon becoming Chairman of the AEC in 1961, he commenced taking daily hikes through a trail that he blazed at the headquarters site in Germantown, Maryland. He frequently invited colleagues and visitors to accompany him, and the trail became known as the \"Glenn Seaborg Trail.\" He and his wife Helen are credited with blazing a trail in the East Bay area near their home in Lafayette, California. This trail has since become a part of the American Hiking Association's cross-country network of trails. Seaborg and his wife walked the trail network from Contra Costa County all the way to the California\u2013Nevada border.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere is a beauty in discovery. There is mathematics in music, a kinship of science and poetry in the description of nature, and exquisite form in a molecule. Attempts to place different disciplines in different camps are revealed as artificial in the face of the unity of knowledge. All literate men are sustained by the philosopher, the historian, the political analyst, the economist, the scientist, the poet, the artisan and the musician.\n\u2014Glenn Seaborg\nSeaborg was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1972 and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) of London in 1985. He was honored as Swedish-American of the Year in 1962 by the Vasa Order of America. In 1991, the organization named \"Local Lodge Glenn T. Seaborg No. 719\" in his honor during the Seaborg Honors ceremony at which he appeared. This lodge maintains a scholarship fund in his name, as does the unrelated Swedish-American Club of Los Angeles.\nSeaborg kept a close bond to his Swedish origin. He visited Sweden every so often, and his family were members of the Swedish \"Pemer Genealogical Society\", a family association open for every descendant of the Pemer family, a Swedish family with German origin, from which Seaborg was descended on his mother's side. (In recent years, after both men's passings, it has been discovered that physicist colleague Edward J. Lofgren was also descended from the Pemer family.) Seaborg even responded to the Swedish king's Nobel prize toast in his mother's native region's dialect, which he described as \"It was as if a Swede had \"y'alled\" in English with a Southern Accent.\"\".\nDeath.\nOn August 24, 1998, while in Boston to attend a meeting by the American Chemical Society, Seaborg suffered a stroke, which led to his death six months later on February 25, 1999, at his home in Lafayette, 58 years and two days to the date that he discovered plutonium.\nHonors and awards.\nDuring his lifetime, Seaborg is said to have been the author or co-author of numerous books and 500 scientific journal articles, many of them brief reports on fast-breaking discoveries in nuclear science while other subjects, most notably the actinide concept, represented major theoretical contributions in the history of science. He held more than 40 patents\u2014among them the only patents ever issued for chemical elements, americium and curium, and received more than 50 doctorates and honorary degrees in his lifetime. At one time, he was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as having the longest entry in Marquis \"Who's Who in America\". In February 2005, he was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In April 2011 the executive council of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) selected Seaborg for inclusion in CSI's Pantheon of Skeptics. The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism. His papers are in the Library of Congress.\nSeaborg was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1948, the American Philosophical Society in 1952, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958. The American Chemical Society-Chicago Section honored him with the Willard Gibbs Award in 1966. The American Academy of Achievement presented Seaborg with the Golden Plate Award in 1972.\nThe element seaborgium was named after Seaborg by Albert Ghiorso, E. Kenneth Hulet, and others, who also credited Seaborg as a co-discoverer. It was named while Seaborg was still alive, which proved controversial. He influenced the naming of so many elements that with the announcement of seaborgium, it was noted in \"Discover\" magazine's review of the year in science that he could receive a letter addressed in chemical elements: seaborgium, lawrencium (for the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory where he worked), berkelium, californium, americium. Seaborgium is the first element ever to have been officially named after a living person. The second element to be so named is oganesson, in 2016, after Yuri Oganessian.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is best known for his work on the supplementary forces that are detected in a rotating frame of reference, leading to the Coriolis effect. He was the first to apply the term \"travail\" (translated as \"work\") for the transfer of energy by a force acting through a distance, and he prefixed the factor &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;+1\u20442 to Leibniz's concept of \"vis viva\", thus specifying today's \"kinetic energy\".\nBiography.\nCoriolis was born in Paris in 1792. In 1808 he sat the entrance exam and was placed second of all the students entering that year, and in 1816, he became a tutor at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, where he did experiments on friction and hydraulics.\nIn 1829, Coriolis published a textbook, \"Calcul de l'Effet des Machines\" (\"Calculation of the Effect of Machines\"), which presented mechanics in a way that could readily be applied by industry. He established the correct expression for kinetic energy, \"mv\"2, and its relation to mechanical work.\nDuring the following years, Coriolis worked to extend the notions of kinetic energy and work to rotating systems. The first of his papers, \"Sur le principe des forces vives dans les mouvements relatifs des machines\" (On the principle of kinetic energy in the relative motion in machines), was read to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences (Coriolis 1832). Three years later came the paper that would make his name famous, \"Sur les \u00e9quations du mouvement relatif des syst\u00e8mes de corps\" (On the equations of relative motion of a system of bodies). Coriolis's papers do not deal with the atmosphere or even the rotation of the Earth, but with the transfer of energy in rotating systems like waterwheels. Coriolis discussed the supplementary forces that are detected in a rotating frame of reference and he divided these forces into two categories. The second category contained the force that would eventually bear his name. A detailed discussion may be found in Dugas.\nIn 1835, he published a mathematical work on collisions of spheres: \"Th\u00e9orie Math\u00e9matique des Effets du Jeu de Billard\", considered a classic on the subject.\nCoriolis's name began to appear in the meteorological literature at the end of the 19th century, although the term \"Coriolis force\" was not used until the beginning of the 20th century. Today, the name Coriolis has become strongly associated with meteorology, but all major discoveries about the general circulation and the relation between the pressure and wind fields were made without knowledge about Gaspard Gustave Coriolis.\nCoriolis became professor of mechanics at the \u00c9cole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures in 1829. Upon the death of Claude-Louis Navier in 1836, Coriolis succeeded him in the chair of applied mechanics at the \u00c9cole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es and to Navier's place in the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences. In 1838, he succeeded Dulong as \"Directeur des \u00e9tudes\" (director of studies) in the \u00c9cole Polytechnique.\nHe died in 1843 at the age of 51 in Paris. His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the son of Grand Prince Taksony and his Oriental\u2014Khazar, Pecheneg or Volga Bulgarian\u2014wife. He married Sarolt, a daughter of an Eastern Orthodox Hungarian chieftain. After ascending the throne, G\u00e9za made peace with the Holy Roman Empire. Within Hungary, he consolidated his authority with extreme cruelty, according to the unanimous narration of nearly contemporaneous sources. He was the first Hungarian monarch to support Christian missionaries from Western Europe. Although he was baptised (his baptismal name was Stephen), his Christian faith remained shallow and he continued to perform acts of pagan worship. He was succeeded by his son Stephen, who was crowned the first King of Hungary in 1000 or 1001.\nEarly life.\nG\u00e9za was the elder son of Taksony, Grand Prince of the Hungarians. His mother was his father's wife \"from the land of the Cumans\", according to the anonymous author of the \"Gesta Hungarorum\". This anachronistic reference to the Cumans suggests that she was of Khazar, Pecheneg or Volga Bulgarian origin. The Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, who listed the descendants of Grand Prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d around 950, did not mention G\u00e9za. Even so, Gyula Krist\u00f3 wrote that G\u00e9za was born around 940 and the emperor ignored him because of his youth. The genuine form of his name was either \"Gye\u00fccsa\" or \"Gyeusa\", which is possibly a diminutive form of the Turkic title \"yabgu\". G\u00e9za's father arranged his marriage with Sarolt\u2014a daughter of a Hungarian chieftain called Gyula, who ruled Transylvania independently of the grand prince and had converted to Christianity in Constantinople. Sarolt seems to have also adhered to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, according to Bruno of Querfurt's remark on her \"languid and muddled Christianity\".\nReign.\nG\u00e9za succeeded his father around 972. He adopted a centralizing policy, which gave rise to his fame as a merciless ruler. The longer version of his son's \"Life\" even states that G\u00e9za's hands were \"defiled with blood\". P\u00e1l Engel wrote that G\u00e9za carried out a \"large-scale purge\" against his relatives, which explains the lack of references to other members of the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty from around 972. Kopp\u00e1ny, who continued to rule the southern parts of Transdanubia, is the only exception to this dearth of references. A marriage alliance between the German and Byzantine dynasties brought about a rapprochement between the two powers neighboring Hungary in 972. G\u00e9za decided to make peace with the Holy Roman Empire. First, a monk named Bruno sent by Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor arrived in Hungary around 972. Hungarian \"legates\" were present at a conference held by the emperor in Quedlinburg in 973.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Geyza, who was strict and cruel, acting in a domineering way, as it were, with his own people, but compassionate and generous with strangers, especially with Christians, although [he was] still entangled in the rite of paganism. At the approach of the light of spiritual grace, he began to discuss peace attentively with all the neighboring provinces\u00a0... Moreover, he laid down a rule that the favor of hospitality and security be shown to all Christians wishing to enter his domains. He gave clerics and monks leave to enter his presence; he offered them a willing hearing, and delighted them in the germination of the seed of true faith sown in the garden of his heart.\u2014\u200a\nA record on one Bishop Prunwart in the Abbey of Saint Gall mentions his success in baptising many Hungarians, including their \"king\". The nearly contemporaneous Thietmar of Merseburg confirms that the conversion to Christianity of the pagan Hungarians started under G\u00e9za, who became the first Christian ruler of Hungary. His baptismal name was Stephen. However, G\u00e9za continued to observe pagan cults, which proves that his conversion to Christianity was never complete. Krist\u00f3 and other historians have said that the first Roman Catholic diocese in Hungary, with its seat in Veszpr\u00e9m, was set up in G\u00e9za's reign, but their view has not been unanimously accepted. A charter issued during his son's reign states that G\u00e9za was the founder of the Benedictine Pannonhalma Archabbey.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[G\u00e9za] was very cruel and killed many people because of his quick temper. When he became a Christian, however, he turned his rage against his reluctant subjects, in order to strengthen this faith. Thus, glowing with zeal for God, he washed away his old crimes. He sacrificed both to the omnipotent God and to various false gods. When reproached by his priest for doing so, however, he maintained that the practice had brought him both wealth and great power.\u2014\u200a\nTaking advantage of internal conflicts which emerged in the Holy Roman Empire after Emperor Otto II's death, G\u00e9za invaded Bavaria and took the fortress of Melk in 983. In 991, the Bavarians launched a counter-attack which forced G\u00e9za to withdraw Hungarian forces from the territories east of the Vienna Woods. Furthermore, he renounced the lands east of the river Leitha in his peace treaty of 996 with Henry IV of Bavaria. G\u00e9za also arranged the marriage of his son and heir Stephen to Henry IV's sister Giselle. Even before this marriage alliance, G\u00e9za convoked the Hungarian leaders to an assembly and forced them to take an oath confirming his son's right to succeed him.\nFamily.\nSarolt gave birth to at least three of G\u00e9za's children: Stephen, who succeeded his father on the throne, and two unnamed daughters. Sarolt survived G\u00e9za, which suggests that she was also the mother of G\u00e9za's daughters. Based on the \"Polish-Hungarian Chronicle\", Szabolcs de Vajay wrote that the daughters' mother was G\u00e9za's alleged second wife Adelaide of Poland, but this has not been widely accepted. Adelaide is only mentioned in the \"Polish\u2013Hungarian Chronicle\", which describes her as the sister of Mieszko I of Poland, but specialists have often questioned her existence. The chronicle attributes G\u00e9za's conversion to Adelaide's influence.\nThe following family tree presents G\u00e9za's ancestry and his offspring.\n\"*Whether Menumorut is an actual or an invented person is debated by modern scholars.\"&lt;br&gt;\"**A Khazar or Pecheneg lady.\"&lt;br&gt;\"***Samuel Aba might have been G\u00e9za's grandson instead of his son-in-law.\"&lt;br&gt;\"****The Aba family descending from them still flourished in the 14th century.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Belonging to the suborder Gekkota, geckos are found in warm climates. They range from .\nGeckos are unique among lizards for their vocalisations, which differ from species to species. Most geckos in the family Gekkonidae use chirping or clicking sounds in their social interactions. Tokay geckos (\"Gekko gecko\") are known for their loud mating calls, and some other species are capable of making hissing noises when alarmed or threatened. They are the most species-rich group of lizards, with about 1,500 different species worldwide.\nAll geckos, except species in the family Eublepharidae, lack eyelids; instead, the outer surface of the eyeball has a transparent membrane, the brille. They have a fixed lens within each iris that enlarges in darkness to let in more light. Since they cannot blink, species without eyelids generally lick their own brilles when they need to clear them of dust and dirt, in order to keep them clean and moist.\nUnlike most lizards, geckos are usually nocturnal and have excellent night vision; their colour vision in low light is 350 times more sensitive than human eyes. The nocturnal geckos evolved from diurnal species, which had lost the rod cells from their eyes. The gecko eye, therefore, modified its cone cells that increased in size into different types, both single and double. Three different photo-pigments have been retained, and are sensitive to ultraviolet, blue, and green. They also use a multifocal optical system that allows them to generate a sharp image for at least two different depths. While most gecko species are nocturnal, some species are diurnal and active during the day, which have evolved multiple times independently.\nMany species are well known for their specialised toe pads, which enable them to grab and climb onto smooth and vertical surfaces, and even cross indoor ceilings with ease. Geckos are well known to people who live in warm regions of the world, where several species make their home inside human habitations. These, for example the house gecko, become part of the indoor menagerie and are often welcomed, as they feed on insect pests including moths and mosquitoes. Like most lizards, geckos can defensively shed their tail; the predator may attack the wriggling tail, allowing the gecko to escape.\nThe largest species, \"Gigarcanum delcourti\", is only known from a single, stuffed specimen probably collected in the 19th century found in the basement of the Natural History Museum of Marseille in Marseille, France. This gecko was long, and was likely endemic to New Caledonia, where it lived in native forests. The smallest gecko, the Jaragua sphaero, is a mere long and was discovered in 2001 on a small island off the coast of Hispaniola.\nEtymology.\nThe Neo-Latin \"gekko\" and English 'gecko' stem from Indonesian-Malaysian \"g\u0113koq\", a Malay word borrowed from Javanese, from \"tokek\", which imitates the sounds that some species like \"Tokay gecko\" make.\nCommon traits.\nLike other reptiles, geckos are ectothermic, producing very little metabolic heat. Essentially, a gecko's body temperature is dependent on its environment. To accomplish bodily functions such as locomotion, feeding or reproduction, geckos must maintain an elevated body temperature.\nShedding or molting.\nAll geckos shed their skin at fairly regular intervals, with species differing in timing and method. Leopard geckos shed at about two- to four-week intervals. The presence of moisture aids in the shedding. When shedding begins, the gecko speeds the process by detaching the loose skin from its body and eating it. For young geckos, shedding occurs more frequently, once a week, but when they are fully grown, they shed once every one to two months.\nAdhesion ability.\nAbout 60% of gecko species have adhesive toepads which allow them to adhere to most surfaces without the use of liquids or surface tension. Such pads have been gained and lost repeatedly over the course of gecko evolution. Adhesive toepads evolved independently in about eleven different gecko lineages, and were lost in at least nine lineages.\nIt was previously thought that the spatula-shaped setae arranged in lamellae on gecko footpads enable attractive van der Waals' forces (the weakest of the weak chemical forces) between the \u03b2-keratin lamellae / setae / spatulae structures and the surface. These van der Waals interactions involve no fluids; in theory, a boot made of synthetic setae would adhere as easily to the surface of the International Space Station as it would to a living-room wall, although adhesion varies with humidity. However, a 2014 study suggests that gecko adhesion is in fact mainly determined by electrostatic interaction (caused by contact electrification), not van der Waals or capillary forces.\nThe setae on the feet of geckos are also self-cleaning, and usually remove any clogging dirt within a few steps. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which has very low surface energy, is more difficult for geckos to adhere to than many other surfaces.\nGecko adhesion is typically improved by higher humidity, even on hydrophobic surfaces, yet is reduced under conditions of complete immersion in water. The role of water in that system is under discussion, yet recent experiments agree that the presence of molecular water layers (water molecules carry a very large dipole moment) on the setae, as well as on the surface, increase the surface energy of both, therefore the energy gain in getting these surfaces in contact is enlarged, which results in an increased gecko adhesion force. Moreover, the elastic properties of the b-keratin change with water uptake.\nGecko toes seem to be double-jointed, but this is a misnomer, and is properly called digital hyperextension. Gecko toes can hyperextend in the opposite direction from human fingers and toes. This allows them to overcome the van der Waals force by peeling their toes off surfaces from the tips inward. In essence, by this peeling action, the gecko separates spatula by spatula from the surface, so for each spatula separation, only some force necessary. (The process is similar to removing Scotch Tape from a surface.)\nGecko toes operate well below their full attractive capabilities most of the time, because the margin for error is great depending upon the surface roughness, and therefore the number of setae in contact with that surface.\nUse of small van der Waals force requires very large surface areas; every square millimetre of a gecko's footpad contains about 14,000\u00a0hair-like setae. Each seta has a diameter of 5\u00a0\u03bcm. Human hair varies from 18 to 180\u00a0\u03bcm, so the cross-sectional area of a human hair is equivalent to 12 to 1300 setae. Each seta is in turn tipped with between 100 and 1,000 spatulae. Each spatula is 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm long (one five-millionth of a metre), or just below the wavelength of visible light.\nThe setae of a typical mature gecko would be capable of supporting a weight of : each spatula could exert an adhesive force of 5 to 25\u00a0nN. The exact value of the adhesion force of a spatula varies with the surface energy of the substrate to which it adheres. Recent studies have moreover shown that the component of the surface energy derived from long-range forces, such as van der Waals forces, depends on the material's structure below the outermost atomic layers (up to 100\u00a0nm beneath the surface); taking that into account, the adhesive strength can be inferred.\nApart from the setae, phospholipids; fatty substances produced naturally in their bodies, also come into play. These lipids lubricate the setae and allow the gecko to detach its foot before the next step.\nThe origin of gecko adhesion likely started as simple modifications to the epidermis on the underside of the toes. This was recently discovered in the genus \"Gonatodes\" from South America. Simple elaborations of the epidermal spinules into setae have enabled \"Gonatodes humeralis\" to climb smooth surfaces and sleep on smooth leaves.\nBiomimetic technologies designed to mimic gecko adhesion could produce reusable self-cleaning dry adhesives with many applications. Development effort is being put into these technologies, but manufacturing synthetic setae is not a trivial material design task.\nSkin.\nGecko skin does not generally bear scales, but appears at a macro scale as a papillose surface, which is made from hair-like protuberances developed across the entire body. These confer superhydrophobicity, and the unique design of the hair confers a profound antimicrobial action. These protuberances are very small, up to 4\u00a0microns in length, and tapering to a point. Gecko skin has been observed to have an anti-bacterial property, killing gram-negative bacteria when they come in contact with the skin.\nThe mossy leaf-tailed gecko of Madagascar, \"U. sikorae\", has coloration developed as camouflage, most being greyish brown to black, or greenish brown, with various markings meant to resemble tree bark; down to the lichens and moss found on the bark. It also has flaps of skin, running the length of its body, head and limbs, known as the \"dermal flap\", which it can lay against the tree during the day, scattering shadows, and making its outline practically invisible.\nTeeth.\nAs polyphyodonts, geckos can replace each of their 100\u00a0teeth every 3 to 4 months. Next to the full grown tooth there is a small replacement tooth developing from the odontogenic stem cell in the dental lamina. The formation of the teeth is pleurodont; they are fused (ankylosed) by their sides to the inner surface of the jaw bones.\nThis formation is common in all species in the order Squamata.\nTaxonomy and classification.\nThe suborder Gekkota is divided into seven families, containing about 125 genera of geckos, including the snake-like (legless) pygopods.\nLegless lizards of the family Dibamidae, also referred to as blind lizards, have occasionally been counted as gekkotans, but recent molecular phylogenies suggest otherwise.\nEvolutionary history.\nSeveral species of lizard from the late Jurassic have been considered early relatives of geckos, the most prominent and most well supported being the arboreal \"Eichstaettisaurus\" from the late Jurassic of Germany. \"Norellius\" from the early Cretaceous of Mongolia is also usually placed as a close relative of geckos. The oldest known fossils of modern geckos are from the mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber of Myanmar (including \"Cretaceogekko\"), around 100 million years old, which have adhesive pads on the feet similar to those of living geckos.\nSpecies.\nMore than 1,850 species of geckos occur worldwide, including these familiar species:\nReproduction.\nMost geckos lay a small clutch of eggs. Some are live-bearing, and a few can reproduce asexually via parthenogenesis. Geckos also have a large diversity of sex-determining mechanisms, including temperature-dependent sex determination and both XX/XY and ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes with multiple transitions among them over evolutionary time.\nMadagascar day geckos engage in a mating ritual in which sexually mature males produce a waxy substance from pores on the back of their legs. Males approach females with a head swaying motion along with rapid tongue flicking in the female.\nObligate parthenogenesis as a reproductive system has evolved multiple times in the family Gekkonidae. It has been shown that oocytes are able to undergo meiosis in three different obligate parthenogenetic complexes of geckos. An extra premeiotic endoreplication of chromosomes is essential for obligate parthenogenesis in these geckos. Appropriate segregation during meiosis to form viable progeny is facilitated by the formation of bivalents made from copies of identical chromosomes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The shows are typically directed by a host, who explains the rules of the program as well as commentating and narrating where necessary. The history of the game shows dates back to the late 1930s when both radio and television game shows were broadcast. The genre became popular in the United States in the 1950s, becoming a regular feature of daytime television.\nFor the purposes of this article, a traditional game show is defined as a radio, television or streaming contest in which prizes can be won within a single episode through objective completion of tasks and not through fan or contestant votes, additionally, contestants, television personalities or celebrities, sometimes as part of a team, play a game which involves answering trivia questions or solving puzzles, usually for prizes such as cash, trips and goods and services.\nCriteria.\nIn a game show, prizes can typically be won in a single match (in some cases, particularly in the ones that offer record-setting prizes, contestants can play multiple matches and accumulate a larger total), though the exact definition of a game show in the modern era is more broad compared to when game shows began in the early 20th century. \"Jeopardy!\" is an example of a game show where contestants can continue to play on the show for an unlimited amount of time (as long as they keep winning), and \"Jeopardy!\" is, to date, the only trivia-based game show that allows contestants to make unlimited consecutive appearances. Game shows are, in most cases, distinguishable from reality television competition shows, in which the competition consumes an entire season of episodes and typically involve either judging or voting, which is antithetical to how a game show is conducted as a game show requires a contestant to complete an objective series of tasks.\nAny show that includes judging and voting are not counted as a game show (with the exception of \"Weakest Link\"), therefore, shows such as \"American Idol\", \"America's Got Talent\", \"The X Factor\", etc. do not count as game shows, as they all involve both judging and voting and fall under the reality show umbrella; thus, the $10,000,000 prize won by Jeffrey Randall Allen in \"Beast Games,\" the $5,000,000 prize Melanie Amaro and Tate Stevens both won on \"The X Factor\", the $4,560,000 prize won by Mai Whelan on \"\" and Sandra Diaz-Twine's and Tony Vlachos's two wins from \"Survivor\" do not count as prizes won on game shows. \"Weakest Link\", however, is a major gray area in this regard as it does feature contestant voting, however, it does meet the criteria for a game show as the show contains trivia, and prize money can also be won within one single episode.\nAdditionally, a streaming platform (as it relates to this article) is defined as an American subscription streaming media service owned by a major corporation. Therefore, any prizes won on game shows streaming on Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+/Hulu, Amazon Prime, Paramount+, Peacock and Apple TV do qualify as prizes won on a game show. Any money won on social media sites (YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) qualify as reality content, not game shows, and do not qualify as a game show win.\nIn recent years, there have been shows that have aired that count as reality game shows, which are a hybrid of a traditional game show and a reality competition. Examples of a reality game show are \"American Ninja Warrior\", \"Deal or No Deal Island\", \"Double Dare\", \"Holey Moley\", \"Legends of the Hidden Temple\", \"Minute to Win It\", \"The Amazing Race\" and \"Wipeout\". These are competition shows that require contestants to complete a series of tasks to advance, and also do not use any voting system to determine an outcome. \"Survivor, American Gladiators\" and \"BattleBots\" do not meet this criteria; \"Survivor\" includes contestant voting that results in a contestant being eliminated, \"American Gladiators\" features some elements of staged performance on the show (staging a game show in any form is illegal under federal law) and \"BattleBots\" has elements of judging, which does not meet the requirements of a game show.\nHistory.\n1930s\u20131950s.\nGame shows began to appear on radio and television in the late 1930s. The first television game show, \"Spelling Bee\", as well as the first radio game show, \"Information Please\", were both broadcast in 1938; the first major success in the game show genre was \"Dr. I.Q.\", a radio quiz show that began in 1939.\n\"Truth or Consequences\" was the first game show to air on commercially licensed television; \"CBS Television Quiz\" followed shortly thereafter as the first to be regularly scheduled. The first episode of each aired in 1941 as an experimental broadcast. Over the course of the 1950s, as television began to pervade the popular culture, game shows quickly became a fixture. Daytime game shows would be played for lower stakes to target stay-at-home housewives. Higher-stakes programs would air in prime time. (One particular exception in this era was \"You Bet Your Life\", ostensibly a game show, but the game show concept was largely a framework for a talk show moderated by its host, Groucho Marx.) During the late 1950s, high-stakes games such as \"Twenty-One\" and \"The $64,000 Question\" began a rapid rise in popularity. However, the rise of quiz shows proved to be short-lived. In 1959, many of the higher stakes game shows were exposed as being either biased or outright scripted in the 1950s quiz show scandals and ratings declines led to most of the primetime games being canceled.\nAn early variant of the game show, the panel show, survived the quiz show scandals. On shows like \"What's My Line?\", \"I've Got a Secret\", and \"To Tell the Truth\", panels of celebrities would interview a guest in an effort to determine some fact about them; in others, celebrities would answer questions. Panel games had success in primetime until the late 1960s, when they were collectively dropped from television because of their perceived low budget nature. Panel games made a comeback in American daytime television (where the lower budgets were tolerated) in the 1970s through comedy-driven shows such as \"Match Game\" and \"Hollywood Squares\". In the UK, commercial demographic pressures were not as prominent, and restrictions on game shows made in the wake of the scandals limited the style of games that could be played and the amount of money that could be awarded. Panel shows there were kept in primetime and have continued to thrive; they have transformed into showcases for the nation's top stand-up comedians on shows such as \"Have I Got News for You\", \"Would I Lie to You?\", \"Mock the Week\", \"QI\", and \"8 Out of 10 Cats\", all of which put a heavy emphasis on comedy, leaving the points as mere formalities. The focus on quick-witted comedians has resulted in strong ratings, which, combined with low costs of production, have only spurred growth in the UK panel show phenomenon.\n1960s\u20131970s.\nGame shows remained a fixture of American daytime television through the 1960s after the quiz show scandals. Lower-stakes games made a slight comeback in daytime in the early 1960s; examples include \"Jeopardy!\" which began in 1964 and the original version of \"The Match Game\" first aired in 1962. \"Let's Make a Deal\" began in 1963 and the 1960s also marked the debut of \"Hollywood Squares\", \"Password\", \"The Dating Game\", and \"The Newlywed Game\".\nThough CBS gave up on daytime game shows in 1968, the other networks did not follow suit. Color television was introduced to the game show genre in the late 1960s on all three networks. The 1970s saw a renaissance of the game show as new games and massive upgrades to existing games made debuts on the major networks. \"The New Price Is Right\", an update of the 1950s-era game show \"The Price Is Right\", debuted in 1972 and marked CBS's return to the game show format in its rural purge. \"The Match Game\" became \"Big Money\" \"Match Game 73\", which proved popular enough to prompt a spin-off, \"Family Feud\", on ABC in 1976. \"The $10,000 Pyramid\" and its numerous higher-stakes derivatives also debuted in 1973, while the 1970s also saw the return of formerly disgraced producer and game show host Jack Barry, who debuted \"The Joker's Wild\" and a clean version of the previously rigged \"Tic-Tac-Dough\" in the 1970s. \"Wheel of Fortune\" debuted on NBC in 1975. The Prime Time Access Rule, which took effect in 1971, barred networks from broadcasting in the 7\u20138 p.m. time slot immediately preceding prime time, opening up time slots for syndicated programming. Most of the syndicated programs were \"nighttime\" adaptations of network daytime game shows. These game shows originally aired once a week, but by the late 1970s and early 1980s most of the games had transitioned to five days a week.\n1980s\u20131990s.\nGame shows were the lowest priority of television networks and were rotated out every thirteen weeks if unsuccessful. Most tapes were wiped until the early 1980s. Over the course of the 1980s and early 1990s, as fewer new hits (e.g. \"Press Your Luck\", \"Sale of the Century\", and \"Card Sharks\") were produced, game shows lost their permanent place in the daytime lineup. ABC transitioned out of the daytime game show format in the mid-1980s (briefly returning to the format for one season in 1990 with a \"Match Game\" revival). NBC's game block also lasted until 1991, but the network attempted to bring them back in 1993 before cancelling its game show block again in 1994. CBS phased out most of its game shows, except for \"The Price Is Right\", by 1993. To the benefit of the genre, the moves of \"Wheel of Fortune\" and a modernized revival of \"Jeopardy!\" to syndication in 1983 and 1984, respectively, was and remains highly successful; the two are, to this day, fixtures in the prime time \"access period\".\nCable television also allowed for the debut of game shows such as \"Supermarket Sweep\" and \"Debt\" (Lifetime), \"Trivial Pursuit\" and \"Family Challenge\" (Family Channel), and \"Double Dare\" (Nickelodeon). It also opened up a previously underdeveloped market for game show reruns. General interest networks such as CBN Cable Network (forerunner to Freeform) and USA Network had popular blocks for game show reruns from the mid-1980s to the mid-'90s before that niche market was overtaken by Game Show Network in 1994.\nIn the United Kingdom, game shows have had a more steady and permanent place in the television lineup and never lost popularity in the 1990s as they did in the United States, due in part to the fact that game shows were highly regulated by the Independent Broadcasting Authority in the 1980s and that those restrictions were lifted in the 1990s, allowing for higher-stakes games to be played.\nIn September 1998, \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" premiered in the United Kingdom with Chris Tarrant (who served as host until February 2014). It was the first game show in the UK to offer a jackpot of \u00a31,000,000 and became a ratings success as soon as it premiered. This led to Michael Davies, who was at the time a young television producer, pitching the idea to the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) later that year. At the time, ABC was suffering from low ratings across all of its programming, and was on the verge of losing its status as one of the \"Big Three\" networks. In addition, the popularity of game shows hit a nadir in the mid-1990s United States (at which point \"The Price Is Right\" was the only game show still on daytime network television and numerous game shows designed for cable television were canceled).\nDavies (who had created the game show \"Debt\" for Lifetime Television and \"Win Ben Stein's Money\" for Comedy Central) decided to bring the show to the United States, certain that it would save ABC from collapse and revive interest in game shows. At this point, the British game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" began distribution around the globe, and upon the show's American debut in 1999, it was a hit and became a regular part of ABC's primetime lineup until 2002; \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" would eventually air in syndication until May 2019 before being revived for primetime in April 2020. Several shorter-lived high-stakes games were attempted around the time of the millennium, both in the United States and the United Kingdom, such as \"Winning Lines\", \"The Chair\", \"Greed\", \"Paranoia\", and \"Shafted\", leading to some dubbing this period as \"The Million-Dollar Game Show Craze\". The boom quickly went bust, as by July 2000, almost all of the imitator million-dollar shows were canceled (one of those exceptions was \"Winning Lines\", which continued to air in the United Kingdom until 2004 even though it was canceled in the United States in early 2000); these higher stakes contests nevertheless opened the door to reality television contests such as \"Survivor\" and \"Big Brother\", in which contestants win large sums of money for outlasting their peers in a given environment. Several game shows returned to daytime in syndication during this time as well, such as \"Family Feud\", \"Hollywood Squares\", and \"Millionaire\".\n2000s\u2013present.\n\"Wheel of Fortune\", \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Family Feud\" have continued in syndication. To keep pace with the prime-time quiz shows, \"Jeopardy!\" doubled its question values in 2001 and lifted its winnings limit in 2003. Nearing the end of \"Jeopardy\"'s 20th season, on June 2, 2004, software engineer Ken Jennings of Salt Lake City, Utah became the new champion on \"Jeopardy!\". With no limit to his appearances, Jennings began to break many game show records: On November 3, 2004, Jennings topped Kevin Olmstead's \"Millionaire\" winnings with his 65th consecutive win, finishing the day with $45,099 and a new cumulative total of $2,197,000 (equivalent to $3,657,000 in 2024). Olmstead had won $2,180,000 on \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" in April 2001 and had been the biggest winner in game show history up until that point.\nJennings won nine more games before his streak came to an end on November 30, 2004, at the hands of contestant Nancy Zerg. He had extended his record total to $2,520,700 at the time of his defeat, after which he was awarded an additional $2,000 for finishing in second place per \"Jeopardy!\" rules. Jennings continues to hold the \"Jeopardy!\" record for longest winning streak on the show and longest winning streak on any game show in the United States; however, Jennings does not hold the record for longest winning streak worldwide; that record is held by Ian Lygo, who won 75 games on the British game show \"100%\" in 1998 (Lygo holds the record as Jennings appeared on \"Jeopardy!\" for 75 days but won 74 games). \"Jeopardy!\" has also increased the stakes of its tournaments and put a larger focus on contestants with strong personalities. The show has since produced four more millionaires: tournament winner Brad Rutter and recent champions James Holzhauer, Matt Amodio, and Amy Schneider.\nIn 2009, actress and comedienne Kim Coles became the first black woman to host a prime-time game show, \"Pay It Off\". \"Family Feud\" revived in popularity with a change in tone under host Steve Harvey to include more ribaldry. Harvey became the first black host of \"Family Feud\" in July 2010 and has hosted the show ever since.\nThe rise of digital television in the United States opened up a large market for rerun programs. Buzzr was established by Fremantle, owners of numerous classic U.S. game shows, as a broadcast outlet for its archived holdings in June 2015. There was also a rise of live game shows at festivals and public venues, where the general audience could participate in the show, such as the science-inspired \"Geek Out Game Show\" or the \"Yuck Show\".\nSince the early 2000s, several game shows were conducted in a tournament format; examples included \"History IQ\", \"Grand Slam\", \"PokerFace\" (which never aired in North America), \"Duel\", \"The Million Second Quiz\", \"500 Questions\", \"The American Bible Challenge\", and \"Mental Samurai\". Most game shows conducted in this manner only lasted for one season.\nA boom in prime time revivals of classic daytime game shows began to emerge in the mid-2010s. In 2016, ABC packaged the existing \"Celebrity Family Feud\", which had returned in 2015, with new versions of \"To Tell the Truth,\" \"The $100,000 Pyramid\", and \"Match Game\" in 2016; new versions of \"Press Your Luck\" and \"Card Sharks\" would follow in 2019. TBS launched a cannabis-themed revival of \"The Joker's Wild\", hosted by Snoop Dogg, in October 2017. This is in addition to a number of original game concepts that appeared near the same time, including \"Awake\", \"Deal or No Deal\" (which originally aired in 2005), \"Child Support\", \"Hollywood Game Night\", \"1 vs. 100\", \"Minute to Win It\" (which originally aired in 2010), \"The Wall\", and a string of music-themed games such as \"Don't Forget the Lyrics!\", \"The Singing Bee\", and \"Beat Shazam\". The game show format staged a comeback on daytime television in the 2020s with new formats such as \"Flip Side\" and \"The Perfect Line\", both syndicated through CBS's syndication wing.\nInternational issues.\nThe popularity of game shows in the United States was closely paralleled around the world. Reg Grundy Organisation, for instance, would buy the international rights for American game shows and reproduce them in other countries, especially in Grundy's native Australia. Dutch producer Endemol (later purchased by American companies Disney and Apollo Global Management, then resold to French company Banijay) has created and released numerous game shows and reality television formats popular around the world. Most game show formats that are popular in one country are franchised to others.\nGame shows have had an inconsistent place in television in Canada, with most homegrown game shows there being made for the French-speaking Quebec market and the majority of English-language game shows in the country being rebroadcast from, or made with the express intent of export to, the United States. There have been exceptions to this (see, for instance, the long-running \"Definition\"). Unlike reality television franchises, international game show franchises generally only see Canadian adaptations in a series of specials, based heavily on the American versions but usually with a Canadian host to allow for Canadian content credits (one of those exceptions was \"Le Banquier\", a Quebec French-language version of \"Deal or No Deal\" which aired on TVA from 2008 to 2015). The smaller markets and lower revenue opportunities for Canadian shows in general also affect game shows there, with Canadian games (especially Quebecois ones) often having very low budgets for prizes, unless the series is made for export. Canadian contestants are generally allowed to participate on American game shows, and there have been at least three Canadian game show hosts \u2013 Howie Mandel, Monty Hall and Alex Trebek \u2013 who have gone on to long careers hosting American series, while Jim Perry, an American host, was prominent as a host of Canadian shows.\nAmerican game shows have a tendency to hire stronger contestants than their British or Australian counterparts. Many of the most successful game show contestants in America would likely never be cast in a British or Australian game show for fear of having them dominate the game, according to Mark Labbett, who appeared in all three countries on the game show \"The Chase\". American game shows have historically avoided allowing contestants who have recently appeared on other game shows to appear on a different game without special dispensation; one of the most infamous cases of a contestant bypassing this rule was that of a woman named Barbara, who appeared on as many as eight game shows between 1976 and 1985 using various surnames (including her married name Barbara Vollick, her maiden name Barbara Marquez, and her middle name Barbara Lowe). Barbara's run eventually ended after a successful five-episode streak on \"Jeopardy!\", when staffers had recognized her from her other game show appearances, leading them to disqualify her from later tournament appearances and to erase Barbara's episodes from the show's archives. This has become less of an issue in the 21st century as contestants who became famous on one game are often cast on another to test how they handle the format.\nJapanese game show.\nThe Japanese game show is a distinct format, borrowing heavily from variety formats, physical stunts and athletic competitions. The Japanese style has been adapted overseas (and at one point was parodied with an American reality competition, \"I Survived a Japanese Game Show\", which used a fake Japanese game show as its central conceit).\nPrizes.\nMany of the prizes awarded on game shows are provided through product placement, but in some cases they are provided by private organizations or purchased at either the full price or at a discount by the show. There is the widespread use of \"promotional consideration\", in which a game show receives a subsidy from an advertiser in return for awarding that manufacturer's product as a prize or consolation prize. Some products supplied by manufacturers may not be intended to be awarded and are instead just used as part of the gameplay such as the low-priced items used in several \"The Price is Right\" pricing games. Although in this show the smaller items (sometimes even in the single digits of dollars) are awarded as well when the price is correctly guessed, even when a contestant loses the major prize they were playing for.\nFor high-stakes games, a network may purchase prize indemnity insurance to avoid paying the cost of a rare but expensive prize out of pocket. If the said prize is won too often, the insurance company may refuse to insure a show; this was a factor in the discontinuation of \"The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular\" series of prime-time specials. In April 2008, three of the contestants on \"The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular\" won the top prize in a five-episode span after fifteen episodes without a winner, due in large part to a change in the rules. The insurance companies had made it extremely difficult to get further insurance for the remaining episodes. A network or syndicator may also opt to distribute large cash prizes in the form of an annuity, spreading the cost of the prize out over several years or decades.\nFrom about 1960 through the rest of the 20th century, American networks placed restrictions on the amount of money that could be given away on a game show, in an effort to avoid a repeat of the scandals of the 1950s. This usually took the form of an earnings cap that forced a player to retire once they had won a certain amount of money or a limit on how many episodes, usually five, on which a player could appear on a show. The introduction of syndicated games, particularly in the 1980s, eventually allowed for more valuable prizes and extended runs on a particular show. British television was under even stricter regulations on prizes until the 1990s, seriously restricting the value of prizes that could be given and disallowing games of chance to have an influence on the results of the game. (Thus, the British version of \"The Price Is Right\" at first did not include the American version's \"Showcase Showdown\", in which contestants spun a large wheel to determine who would advance to the Showcase bonus round.) In Canada, prizes were limited not by bureaucracy but necessity, as the much smaller population limited the audience of shows marketed toward that country. The lifting of these restrictions in the 1990s was a major factor in the explosion of high-stakes game shows in the later part of that decade in both the U.S. and Britain and, subsequently, around the world.\nBonus round.\nA bonus round (also known as a bonus game or an end game) usually follows a main game as a bonus to the winner of that game. In the bonus round, the stakes are higher and the game is considered to be tougher.\nThe game play of a bonus round usually varies from the standard game play of the front game, and there are often borrowed or related elements of the main game in the bonus round to ensure the entire show has a unified premise. Though some end games are referred to as \"bonus rounds\", many are not specifically referred to as such in games but fit the same general role. There is no one formula for the format of a bonus round.\nUntil the 1960s, most game shows did not offer a bonus round. In traditional two-player formats, the winner \u2013 if a game show's rules provided for this \u2013 became the champion and simply played a new challenger either on the next show or after the commercial break.\nOne of the earliest forms of bonus rounds was the Jackpot Round of the original series \"Beat the Clock\". After two rounds of performing stunts, the wife of the contestant couple would perform at a jackpot board for a prize. The contestant was shown a famous quotation or common phrase, and the words were scrambled. To win the announced bonus, the contestant had to unscramble the words within 20 seconds. The contestant received a consolation gift worth over $200 if she was unsuccessful.\nAnother early bonus round ended each episode of \"You Bet Your Life\" with the team who won the most money answering one final question for a jackpot which started at $1,000 and increased $500 each week until won.\nAnother early example was the Lightning Round on the word game \"Password\", starting in 1961. The contestant who won the front game played a quick-fire series of passwords within 60 seconds, netting $50 per correctly guessed word, for a maximum bonus prize of $250.\nThe bonus round came about after game show producer Mark Goodson was first presented \"Password\", contending that it was not enough to merely guess passwords during the show. \"We needed something more, and that's how the Lightning Round was invited,\" said Howard Felsher, who produced \"Password\" and \"Family Feud\". \"From that point on every game show had to have an end round. You'd bring a show to a network, and they'd say, 'What's the endgame?' as if they had thought of it themselves.\"\nThe audience-match half of the \"Super Match\", the endgame round from all versions of \"Match Game\" since 1973, served as the impetus for \"Family Feud\"."}

{"id": "13137", "revid": "27991771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13137", "title": "Grindcore", "text": "Extreme genre of music\nGrindcore is an extreme fusion genre of heavy metal and hardcore punk that originated in the mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from abrasive-sounding musical styles, such as thrashcore, crust punk, hardcore punk, extreme metal, and industrial. Grindcore is considered a more noise-filled style of hardcore punk while using hardcore's trademark characteristics such as heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high-speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls, shouts and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups such as England's Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.\nA trait of grindcore is the \"microsong\", far shorter than average for punk or metal. Several bands have produced songs that are only seconds in length. Many bands, such as Agoraphobic Nosebleed, record simple phrases that may be rhythmically sprawled out across an instrumental lasting only a couple of bars in length.\nA variety of subgenres and microgenres have subsequently emerged, often labeling bands according to traits that deviate from regular grindcore; including goregrind, focused on themes of gore (e.g. mutilation and pathology), and pornogrind, fixated on pornographic lyrical themes. Another offshoot is cybergrind which incorporates electronic music elements such as sampling and programmed drums. Although influential within hardcore punk and extreme metal, grindcore remains an underground form of music.\nCharacteristics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere are blurry lines that separate death metal, grindcore, and thrash metal and even black metal; some bands certainly overlap these genres. What sets grindcore apart mostly is how bands push the limits known to extreme music with more intensity, speed, intensity and lyrics. Short, buzzing riffs fast enough to snap necks; guttural vocals, and blast beats underneath it all define some of grindcore's key characteristics.\n Alex Distefano of \"OC Weekly\" (March 4, 2014) https://\nKnown for being \"among the noisiest, fastest and rawest kinds of metal,\" grindcore is influenced by crust punk, thrashcore, hardcore punk, death metal and thrash metal, as well as noise musical acts like Swans. The name derives from the fact that \"grind\" is a British term for \"thrash\"; that term was prepended to \"-core\" from \"hardcore\". Grindcore relies on standard hardcore punk instrumentation: electric guitar, bass and drums. However, grindcore alters the usual practices of metal or rock music in regard to song structure and tone. The vocal style is \"ranging from high-pitched shrieks to low, throat-shredding growls and barks.\" In some cases, no clear lyrics exist. Vocals may be used as merely an added sound effect, a common practice with bands such as the experimental and jazz-infused band Naked City.\nA characteristic of some grindcore songs is the \"microsong,\" lasting only a few seconds. In 2001, the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" awarded Brutal Truth the record for \"Shortest Music Video\" for 1994's \"Collateral Damage\" (the song lasts four seconds). In 2007, the video for the Napalm Death song \"You Suffer\" set a new \"Shortest Music Video\" record: 1.3 seconds. Beyond the microsong, it is characteristic of grindcore to have short songs in general; for example, Carcass' debut album \"Reek of Putrefaction\" (1988) consists of 22 tracks with an average length of 1 minute and 48 seconds. It is common for grindcore albums to be very short when compared to other genres, usually consisting of a large track list but having a total length of only 15 to 20 minutes.\nMany grindcore groups experiment with tuned-down guitars and play mostly with downstrokes of the pick, power chords and heavy distortion. While the vinyl A-side of Napalm Death's debut, 1987's \"Scum\", is set to Eb tuning, on side B, the guitars are tuned down to C. Their second album \"From Enslavement to Obliteration\" and the \"Mentally Murdered\" EP were tuned to C \u266f. \"Harmony Corruption\", their third full-length album, was tuned up to a D. Bolt Thrower went further, dropping 3\u00bd steps down (A). The bass playing is often overdriven.\nBlast beat.\nThe blast beat is a drum beat characteristic of grindcore in all its forms, although its usage predates the genre itself, in Adam MacGregor's definition, \"the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the kick drum, snare and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.\" Blast beats have been described as \"maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per se than sheer sonic violence.\" Napalm Death coined the term, though this style of drumming had previously been practiced by others. Daniel Ekeroth argues that the blast beat was first performed by the Swedish group Asocial on their 1982 demo. L\u00e4rm (\"Campaign For Musical Destruction\") Dirty Rotten Imbeciles (\"No Sense\"), Stormtroopers of Death (\"Milk\"), Sarc\u00f3fago (\"Satanas\"), Sepultura (\"Antichrist\"), and Repulsion also included the technique prior to Napalm Death's emergence.\nLyrical themes.\nGrindcore lyrics are typically provocative. A number of grindcore musicians are committed to political and ethical causes, generally leaning towards the far left in connection to grindcore's punk roots. For example, Napalm Death's songs address a variety of anarchist concerns, in the tradition of anarcho-punk. These themes include anti-racism, feminism, anti-militarism, and anti-capitalism. Early grindcore bands including Napalm Death, Agathocles and Carcass made animal rights one of their primary lyrical themes. Some of them, such as Cattle Decapitation and Carcass, have expressed disgust with human behavior and animal abuse, and are, in some cases, vegetarians or vegans. Carcass' work in particular is often identified as the origin of the goregrind style, which is devoted to \"bodily\" themes. Groups that shift their bodily focus to sexual matters, such as Gut and the Meat Shits, are sometimes referred to as pornogrind. Seth Putnam's lyrics are notorious for their black comedy, while The Locust tend toward satirical collage, indebted to William S. Burroughs' cut-up method.\nHistory.\nPrecursors.\nThe early grindcore scene relied on an international network of tape trading and DIY production. The most widely acknowledged precursors of the grindcore sound are Siege and Repulsion, an early death metal outfit. Siege, from Weymouth, Massachusetts, were influenced by classic American hardcore (Minor Threat, Black Flag, Void) and by British groups like Discharge, Venom, and Mot\u00f6rhead. Siege's goal was maximum velocity: \"We would listen to the fastest punk and hardcore bands we could find and say, 'Okay, we're gonna deliberately write something that is faster than them'\", drummer Robert Williams recalled. Repulsion is sometimes credited with inventing the classic grind blast beat (played at 190 bpm), as well as its distinctive bass tone. Kevin Sharp of Brutal Truth declares that \"\"Horrified\" was and still is the defining core of what grind became; a perfect mix of hardcore punk with metallic gore, speed and distortion.\" Writer Freddy Alva credited NYC Mayhem as a notable precursor, calling them \"arguably one of the fastest bands on the planet back [in the mid 1980s]\".\nOther groups in the British grindcore scene, such as Heresy and Unseen Terror, have emphasized the influence of American hardcore punk, including Septic Death, as well as Swedish D-beat. Sore Throat cites Discharge, Disorder, and a variety of European D-beat and thrash metal groups, including Hellhammer, and American hardcore groups, such as Poison Idea and D.R.I. Japanese hardcore, particularly GISM, is also mentioned by a number of originators of the style. Other key groups cited by current and former members of Napalm Death as formative influences include Discharge, Amebix, Throbbing Gristle, and the aforementioned Dirty Rotten Imbeciles. Post-punk, such as Killing Joke and Joy Division, was also cited as an influence on early Napalm Death.\nBritish grindcore.\nGrindcore, as such, was developed during the mid-1980s in the United Kingdom by Napalm Death, a group who emerged from the anarcho-punk scene in Birmingham, England. While their first recordings were in the vein of Crass, they eventually became associated with crust punk, The group began to take on increasing elements of thrashcore, post-punk, and power electronics, and began describing their sound as \"Siege with Celtic Frost riffs\". The group also went through many changes in personnel. A major shift in style took place after Mick Harris became the group's drummer. Punk historian Ian Glasper indicates that \"For several months gob-smacked audiences weren't sure whether Napalm Death were actually a serious band any longer, such was the undeniable novelty of their hyper-speed new drummer.\" Albert Mudrian's research suggests that the name \"grindcore\" was coined by Harris. When asked about coming up with the term, Harris said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Grindcore came from \"grind\", which was the only word I could use to describe Swans after buying their first record in '84. Then with this new hardcore movement that started to really blossom in '85, I thought \"grind\" really fit because of the speed so I started to call it grindcore.\nOther sources contradict Harris' claim. In a \"Spin\" magazine article written about the genre, Steven Blush declares that \"the man often credited\" for dubbing the style grindcore was Shane Embury, Napalm Death's bassist since 1987. Embury offers his own account of how the grindcore \"sound\" came to be:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As far as how this whole sound got started, we were really into Celtic Frost, Siege \u2013 which is a hardcore band from Boston \u2013 a lot of hardcore and death-metal bands, and some industrial-noise bands like the early Swans. So, we just created a mesh of all those things. It's just everything going at a hundred miles per hour, basically.\nEarache Records founder Digby Pearson concurs with Embury, saying that Napalm Death \"put hardcore and metal through an accelerator.\" Pearson, however, said that grindcore \"wasn't just about the speed of [the] drums, blast beats, etc.\" He claimed that \"it actually was coined to describe the guitars \u2013 heavy, downtuned, bleak, harsh riffing guitars [that] 'grind', so that's what the genre was described as, by the musicians who were its innovators [and] proponents.\"\nWhile abrasive, grindcore achieved a measure of mainstream visibility. \"New Musical Express\" featured Napalm Death on their cover in 1988, declaring them \"the fastest band in the world.\" As James Hoare, deputy editor of \"Terrorizer\", writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It can be argued that no strand of extreme metal (with a touch of hardcore and post-punk tossed in for flavouring), has had so big an impact outside the gated community of patch-jackets and circle-pits as grindcore has in the UK. [...] the genre is a part of the British musical experience.\nNapalm Death's seismic impact inspired other British grindcore groups in the 1980s, among them Extreme Noise Terror, Carcass and Sore Throat. Extreme Noise Terror, from Ipswich, formed in 1984. With the goal of becoming \"the most extreme hardcore punk band of all time,\" the group took Mick Harris from Napalm Death in 1987. Ian Glasper describes the group as \"pissed-off hateful noise with its roots somewhere between early Discharge and Disorder, with [vocalists] Dean [Jones] and Phil [Vane] pushing their trademark vocal extremity to its absolute limit.\" In 1991, the group collaborated with the acid house group The KLF, appearing onstage with the group at the Brit Awards in 1992. Carcass released \"Reek of Putrefaction\" in 1988, which John Peel declared his favorite album of the year despite its very poor production. The band's focus on gore and anatomical decay, lyrically and in sleeve artwork, inspired the goregrind subgenre. Sore Throat, said by Ian Glasper to have taken \"perhaps the most uncompromisingly anti-music stance\" were inspired by crust punk as well as industrial music. Some listeners, such as Digby Pearson, considered them to be simply an in-joke or parody of grindcore.\nIn the subsequent decade, two pioneers of the style became increasingly commercially viable. According to Nielsen Soundscan, Napalm Death sold 367,654 units between May 1991 and November 2003, while Carcass sold 220,374 units in the same period. The inclusion of Napalm Death's \"Twist the Knife (Slowly)\" on the \"Mortal Kombat\" soundtrack brought the band much greater visibility, as the compilation scored a Top 10 position in the \"Billboard\" 200 chart and went platinum in less than a year. The originators of the style have expressed some ambivalence regarding the subsequent popularity of grindcore. Pete Hurley, the guitarist of Extreme Noise Terror, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: \"\"grindcore\" was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and it had nothing to do with us whatsoever. ENT were, are, and \u2013 I suspect \u2013 always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term you can come up with.\" Lee Dorrian of Napalm Death indicated that \"Unfortunately, I think the same thing happened to grindcore, if you want to call it that, as happened to punk rock \u2013 all the great original bands were just plagiarised by a billion other bands who just copied their style identically, making it no longer original and no longer extreme.\"\nNorth American grindcore.\nJournalist Kevin Stewart-Panko argues that the American grindcore of the 1990s borrowed from three sources: British grindcore, the American precursors, and death metal. As early Napalm Death albums were not widely distributed in the United States, American groups tended to take inspiration from later works, such as \"Harmony Corruption\". American groups also often employ riffs taken from crossover thrash or thrash metal. Early American grind practitioners included Terrorizer and Ass\u00fcck. Anal Cunt, a particularly dissonant group who lacked a bass player, were also particularly influential. Their style was sometimes referred to as \"noisecore\" or \"noisegrind\", described by Giulio of Cripple Bastards as \"the most anti-musical and nihilistic face of extreme music at that time.\" Brutal Truth was a groundbreaking group in the American scene at the beginning of the 1990s.\nHowever, Sharp indicates that they were more inspired by the thrash metal of Dark Angel than the British groups. Discordance Axis had a more technical style of playing than many of the predecessors, and had a much more ornate visual and production style. Scott Hull is prominent in the contemporary grindcore scene, through his participation in Pig Destroyer and Agoraphobic Nosebleed. ANb's \"Frozen Corpse Stuffed with Dope\" has been described as \"the \"Paul's Boutique\" of grindcore\", by \"Village Voice\" critic Phil Freeman, for its \"hyper-referential, impossibly dense barrage of samples, blast beats, answering machine messages, and incomprehensibly bellowed rants.\" Pig Destroyer is inspired by thrash metal, such as Dark Angel and Slayer, the sludge metal of the Melvins, and grindcore practiced by Brutal Truth, while Agoraphobic Nosebleed takes cues from thrashcore and powerviolence, like D.R.I. and Crossed Out.\nThe Locust, from San Diego, also take inspiration from powerviolence (Crossed Out, Dropdead), first-wave screamo (Angel Hair), obscure experimental rock (Art Bears, Renaldo and the Loaf), and death metal. The Locust were sometimes described as \"hipster grind\" because of their fan base and fashion choices. In Los Angeles, Hole also initially drew influence from grindcore in their early releases, particularly on their singles \"Dicknail\" and \"Teenage Whore\", as well as on their debut album, \"Pretty on the Inside\" (1991), all of which featured sexually provocative and violent lyrics, as well as the heavy distortion and fluctuating tempo that distinguished the genre. Frontwoman Courtney Love stated that she wanted to capture the distinguishing elements of grindcore while incorporating more pop-based melodic structure, although the band distanced themselves from the style in their later releases.\nOther later prominent grindcore groups of North America include Brujeria, Soilent Green, Cephalic Carnage, Impetigo, and Circle of Dead Children. Fuck the Facts, a Canadian group, practice classic grindcore, characterized by the \"metronome-precision drumming and riffing [that] abound, as well as vocal screams and growls\" by \"AllMusic\" reviewer Greg Prato.\nContinental European grindcore.\nEuropean groups, such as Agathocles, from Belgium, Patareni, of Croatia, and , from Switzerland, are important early practitioners of the style. Filthy Christians, who signed to Earache Records in 1989, introduced the style in Sweden, D.D.T. &amp; Fear of Dog were pioneering grind &amp; noise in Serbia since mid-end of '80, Extreme Smoke 57 in Slovenia at the early beginning of the '90, while Cripple Bastards established Italian grindcore. Giulio of Cripple Bastards asserts that the name itself took some time to migrate from Britain, with the style being referred to as \"death-thrashcore\" for a time in Europe.\nNasum, who emerged from the Swedish death metal scene, became a popular group, addressing political topics from a personal perspective.\nAnders Jakobson, their drummer, reported that \"It was all these different types of people who enjoyed what we were doing. [...] We made grindcore a bit easier to listen to at the expense of the diehard grindcore fans who thought that we were, well, not sellouts, but not really true to the original essence of grindcore.\" Other Swedish groups, such as General Surgery and Regurgitate, practiced goregrind. Inhume, from the Netherlands, Rotten Sound, from Finland, and Leng Tch'e, from Belgium, were subsequent European groups who practiced grindcore with death metal inflections. In 2000s, the Belgium-based Aborted \"had grown into the role of key contributors to the death-grind genres\".\nGrindcore in Asian countries.\nIn 2010, Singaporean band Wormrot signed a recording contract with Earache Records.\nIn 2019, Filipino band TUBERO signed a recording contract with Tower of Doom Records.\nInfluence.\nJapanese noise rock group Boredoms have borrowed elements of grind, and toured with Brutal Truth in 1993. The Japanese grindcore group Gore Beyond Necropsy formed in 1989, and later collaborated with noise music artist Merzbow. Naked City, led by avant-garde jazz saxophonist John Zorn, performed an avant-garde form of polystylistic, grindcore-influenced punk jazz. Zorn later formed the Painkiller project with ambient dub producer Bill Laswell on bass guitar and Mick Harris on drums, which also collaborated with Justin Broadrick on some work. In addition, grindcore was one influence on the powerviolence movement within American hardcore punk, and has affected some strains of metalcore. Some musicians have also produced hybrids between grind and electronic music.\nPowerviolence.\nPowerviolence is a raw and dissonant subgenre of hardcore punk. The style is closely related to thrashcore and similar to grindcore. While powerviolence took inspiration from Napalm Death and other early grind bands, powerviolence groups avoided elements of heavy metal. Its nascent form was pioneered in the late 1980s in the music of hardcore punk band Infest, who mixed youth crew hardcore elements with noisier, sludgier qualities of L\u00e4rm and Siege. The microgenre solidified into its most commonly recognized form in the early 1990s, with the sounds of bands such as Man Is the Bastard, Crossed Out, No Comment, Capitalist Casualties, and Manpig.\nPowerviolence bands focus on speed, brevity, bizarre timing breakdowns, and constant tempo changes. Powerviolence songs are often very short; it is not uncommon for some to last less than 30 seconds. Some groups, particularly Man Is the Bastard, took influence from sludge metal and noise music. Lyrically and conceptually, powerviolence groups were very raw and underproduced, both sonically and in their packaging. Some groups (Man Is the Bastard, Azucares and Dropdead) took influence from anarcho-punk and crust punk, emphasizing animal rights and anti-militarism. The Locust and Agoraphobic Nosebleed later reincorporated elements of powerviolence into grindcore.\nIndustrial and electronic influence.\nAmong other influences, Napalm Death took impetus from the industrial music scene. Subsequently, Napalm Death's former guitarist, Justin Broadrick, went on to a career in industrial metal with Godflesh. Mick Harris, in his post-Napalm Death project, Scorn, briefly experimented with the style. Scorn also worked in the industrial hip hop and isolationist styles. Fear Factory have also cited debts to the genre. Digital hardcore is an initially German hybrid of hardcore punk and hardcore techno. Agoraphobic Nosebleed and the Locust have solicited remixes from digital hardcore producers and noise musicians. James Plotkin, Dave Witte, and Speedranch participated in the Phantomsmasher project, which melds grindcore and digital hardcore. Alec Empire collaborated with Justin Broadrick, on the first Curse of the Golden Vampire album, and with Gabe Serbian, of the Locust, live in Japan. Japanoise icon Merzbow also participated in the Empire/Serbian show.\nElectrogrind.\nThe 21st century also saw the development of \"electrogrind\" (or \"cybergrind\"), practiced by The Berzerker, Gigantic Brain and Genghis Tron which borrows from electronic music. These groups built on the work of Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Enemy Soil and The Locust, as well as industrial metal. The Berzerker also appropriated the distorted Roland TR-909 kick drums of gabber producers. Bands like Libido Airbag and Cumfilled Brain incorporates elements of Grindcore, such as pitch-shifted, gurgled vocals, with the rhythmic structures of Techstep. Many later electrogrind groups were caricatured for their hipster connections.\nMathcore and screamo.\nIn the mid-1990s, mathcore groups such as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Some Girls, and Daughters began to take inspiration from developments in grindcore. These groups also include elements of post-hardcore. In addition to mathcore, some early screamo groups, like Circle Takes the Square and Orchid, have been associated with grindcore by some commentators.\nCrust punk.\nCrust punk had a major impact on grindcore's emergence. The first grindcore, practiced by British bands such as Napalm Death, Extreme Noise Terror and Disrupt emerged from the crust punk scene. This early style is sometimes dubbed \"crustgrind\".\nDeathgrind.\nDeathgrind is a shorthand term that is used to describe bands who play a fusion of death metal and grindcore. With growing popularity of grindcore in the metal fandom, some death metal bands were noted to feature a heavy amount of grindcore influence; thus, these bands ended up becoming called \"deathgrind\" for short (sometimes written as \"death-grind\" or \"death/grind\"). Dan Lilker described deathgrind as \"combining the technicality of death metal with the intensity of grindcore.\" Some examples of death metal and grindcore hybrids include Ass\u00fcck, Circle of Dead Children, Misery Index, Exhumed, Gorerotted and Cattle Decapitation. Ass\u00fcck in particular has been credited as one of the earliest deathgrind acts.\nBlackened grindcore.\nBlackened grindcore is a fusion genre that combines elements of black metal and grindcore. Notable bands include Anaal Nathrakh and early Rotting Christ.\nNoisegrind.\nNoisegrind (also known as grindnoise) is a microgenre that combines elements of grindcore and harsh noise. Notable bands include Holy Grinder, Sete Star Sept, Full of Hell, Fear of God, Insufferable, and early Knelt Rote.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Through his mother, he was related to the royal court in Buda. He entered the service of his uncle, King Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary, living at his court from 1506. The king received him as an adopted son, entrusted him in 1515 with the Duchy of Oppeln, and in 1516 made him member of the tutelary government instituted for Hungary, and tutor of his son Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia. In 1521 he made an arrangement with Petar Keglevi\u0107 and pulled back from Hungary and Croatia; this arrangement, accepted by Louis II in 1526, was not accepted by Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I until 1559.\nCareer.\nTerritories and influence.\nAt the court of Hungary there were two parties arrayed against each other: the Magyar party under the leadership of Z\u00e1polyas and the German party under the leadership of George of Brandenburg, whose authority was increased by the acquisition of the duchies of Ratibor and Oppeln by hereditary treaties with their respective dukes and of the territories of Oderberg, Beuthen, and Tarnowitz as pledges from the king of Bohemia, who could not redeem his debts.\nBy the further appropriation of the Duchy of J\u00e4gerndorf, George came into possession of all Upper Silesia. As the owner and mortgagee of these territories he prepared the way for the introduction of the Protestant Reformation, here as well as in his native Franconia. Earlier than any other German prince or any other member of the Hohenzollern line including even his younger brother Albert, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, he turned his eyes and heart to the new faith proceeding from Wittenberg.\nConversion.\nThe first reformatory writings began the work of winning him over to the evangelical cause. Martin Luther's powerful testimony of faith at the Diet of Worms in 1521 made an indelible impression upon his mind, and the vigorous sermons of evangelical preachers in the pulpits of St. Lawrence and St. Sebald in Nuremberg, during the diet there in 1522, deepened the impression. The study of Luther's translation of the New Testament, which appeared in 1522, established his faith on personal conviction. Moreover, he entered into correspondence with Luther, discussing with him the most important problems of faith, and in 1524 he met him personally during the negotiations concerning his brother Albert's secularization of the Teutonic Order's state of Prussia into the secular Duchy of Prussia.\nAfter the accession of King Louis II, George was aided in his reforming efforts by Queen Maria, a sister of Charles V and Ferdinand I, who was favorably inclined toward the new doctrine. As the adviser of the young king, George firmly advocated the cause of the new gospel against the influences and intrigues of his clerical opponents and successfully prevented their violent measures. His relationship with Duke Frederick II of Liegnitz, Brieg, and Wohlau, and with Duke Charles I of M\u00fcnsterberg-Oels, who had both admitted the Reformation into their territories, contributed not a little to the expansion of the gospel in his own lands. But it was his own personal influence, energy, and practical spirit that introduced the new doctrine and founded a new evangelical and churchly life. He made efforts to secure preachers of the new gospel from Hungary, Silesia, and Franconia, and tried to introduce the church order of Brandenburg-Nuremberg, which had already found acceptance in the Franconian territories.\nReformation in Franconia.\nIn the hereditary lands Brandenburg-Ansbach in Franconia, where with his older brother Casimir of Brandenburg-Kulmbach had assumed the regency in place of their father, he encountered greater difficulties, although the popular spirit was inclined toward the Reformation. Owing to his marriage with a Bavarian princess and to his military command in the imperial service, his brother was allied more closely with the old church and resisted the new reforming efforts. But the pressure of the estates of the land soon compelled him to allow preaching according to Luther's doctrine, although he ensured retention of the old church ceremonies, even of those that were contrary to the new faith.\nGeorge protested against such half-measures and showed his dissatisfaction with the half-hearted resolutions of the state assembly of October 1526. It was only after the death of his brother that as sole ruler he could successfully undertake and carry out reformation in the Franconian territories, with the assistance of councillors such as Johann von Schwarzenberg and through the new resolutions of the state assembly of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1528). At the same time George maintained his correspondence with Luther and Philipp Melanchthon, discussing such questions as the evangelization of monasteries, the use of monastic property for evangelical purposes, and especially the foundation of lower schools for the people and of higher schools for the education of talented young men for the service of church and state. He despoiled the churches and cloisters in his domains of all their gold and silver, their monstrances, vessels, chalices, pearls, jewels, images and precious vestments. He used 50,000 florins of the proceeds to pay off Casimir's gambling debts and other liabilities, and he endowed his son Frederick with ecclesiastical benefices with a total revenue of 190,000 florins. He tried to gain, by his continued correspondence with Luther and other reformers such as Urbanus Rhegius, efficient men for the preaching of the gospel and for the organization of the evangelical church. Hand in hand with the Council of Nuremberg he worked for the institution of a church visitation on the model of that of the Electorate of Saxony, from which after repeated revisions and emendations the excellent church order of Brandenburg-Nuremberg of 1533 was developed. After its introduction in Nuremberg and his territories in Franconia, it was also introduced in his dominions in Upper Silesia.\nInfluence beyond his territories.\nGeorge's influence manifested itself also in the development of the German Reformation as a whole. When a union of the evangelicals in upper and lower Germany was contemplated as a means of improved defense against the retaliatory measures of the Roman Catholic Church, George had a meeting with Elector John of Saxony at Schleitz in 1529, where they agreed on certain articles of faith and confession to be drawn up by Luther; the commission was executed in the seventeen articles of Schwabach on the basis of the fifteen theses of the Marburg Colloquy.\nBut neither at the Convention of Schwabach nor at that of Schmalkalden did George approve armed resistance against the emperor and his party, even in self-defense. He opposed the emperor energetically at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, when the emperor demanded the prohibition of evangelical preaching. King Ferdinand made George the most alluring offers of Silesian possessions if he would support the emperor, but he strongly rejected them. Next to the elector of Saxony, he stands foremost among the princes who defended the reformed faith. After the death of his cousin, Joachim I, who was a strict Catholic, he assisted his sons in the introduction of the Reformation in the territories of the Electorate of Brandenburg. He took part in the religious colloquy of Regensburg in 1541 where Elector Joachim II made a last attempt to bridge the differences between the Catholics and Lutherans and with his nephew requested Luther's cooperation. The Diet of Regensburg was the last religious meeting which he attended.\nHe is one of the figures on the \"Prussian Homage\" painting by Jan Matejko.\nFamily and children.\nGeorge was married three times. His first marriage was to Beatrice de Frangepan (1480 \u2013 c.\u20091510) on 21 January 1509 in Gyula; the marriage produced no children.\nGeorge's second marriage took place on 9 January 1525, to Hedwig of M\u00fcnsterberg-Oels (1508\u20131531), daughter of Charles I of M\u00fcnsterberg-Oels; their marriage produced two daughters:\nHis third wife was Emilie of Saxony (27 July 1516 \u2013 9 March 1591), daughter of Henry IV, Duke of Saxony, and Catherine of Mecklenburg on 25 August 1533:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For the purpose of the proof we will assume the following without loss of generality:\nformula_31\nThe proof for unweighted power means can be easily obtained by substituting \"wi\" = 1/\"n\".\nEquivalence of inequalities between means of opposite signs.\nSuppose an average between power means with exponents p and q holds:\nformula_32\napplying this, then:\nformula_33\nWe raise both sides to the power of \u22121 (strictly decreasing function in positive reals):\nformula_34\nWe get the inequality for means with exponents \u2212\"p\" and \u2212\"q\", and we can use the same reasoning backwards, thus proving the inequalities to be equivalent, which will be used in some of the later proofs.\nGeometric mean.\nFor any \"q\" &gt; 0 and non-negative weights summing to 1, the following inequality holds:\nformula_35\nThe proof follows from Jensen's inequality, making use of the fact the logarithm is concave:\nformula_36\nBy applying the exponential function to both sides and observing that as a strictly increasing function it preserves the sign of the inequality, we get\nformula_37\nTaking q-th powers of the xi yields\nformula_38\nThus, we are done for the inequality with positive q; the case for negatives is identical but for the swapped signs in the last step:\nformula_39\nOf course, taking each side to the power of a negative number -1/\"q\" swaps the direction of the inequality.\nformula_40\nInequality between any two power means.\nWe are to prove that for any \"p\" &lt; \"q\" the following inequality holds:\nformula_41\nif p is negative, and q is positive, the inequality is equivalent to the one proved above:\nformula_42\nThe proof for positive p and q is as follows: Define the following function: \"f\" : R+ \u2192 R+ formula_43. f is a power function, so it does have a second derivative:\nformula_44\nwhich is strictly positive within the domain of f, since \"q\" &gt; \"p\", so we know f is convex.\nUsing this, and the Jensen's inequality we get:\nformula_45\nafter raising both side to the power of 1/\"q\" (an increasing function, since 1/\"q\" is positive) we get the inequality which was to be proven:\nformula_46\nUsing the previously shown equivalence we can prove the inequality for negative p and q by replacing them with \u2212q and \u2212p, respectively.\nGeneralized \"f\"-mean.\nThe power mean could be generalized further to the generalized f-mean:\nformula_47\nThis covers the geometric mean without using a limit with \"f\"(\"x\") \n log(\"x\"). The power mean is obtained for \"f\"(\"x\") \n \"xp\". Properties of these means are studied in de Carvalho (2016).\nApplications.\nSignal processing.\nA power mean serves a non-linear moving average which is shifted towards small signal values for small p and emphasizes big signal values for big p.

He became one of the most influential mathematicians of the Renaissance and one of the key figures in the foundation of probability; he introduced the binomial coefficients and the binomial theorem in the Western world. He wrote more than 200 works on science.\nCardano partially invented and described several mechanical devices including the combination lock, the gimbal consisting of three concentric rings allowing a supported compass or gyroscope to rotate freely, and the Cardan shaft with universal joints, which allows the transmission of rotary motion at various angles and is used in vehicles to this day. He made significant contributions to hypocycloids - published in \"De proportionibus\", in 1570. The generating circles of these hypocycloids, later named \"Cardano circles\" or \"cardanic circles\", were used for the construction of the first high-speed printing presses.\nToday, Cardano is well known for his achievements in algebra. In his 1545 book \"Ars Magna\" he made the first systematic use of negative numbers in Europe, published (with attribution) the solutions of other mathematicians for cubic and quartic equations, and acknowledged the existence of imaginary numbers.\nEarly life and education.\nCardano was born on 24 September 1501 in Pavia, Lombardy, the illegitimate child of Fazio Cardano, a mathematically gifted jurist, lawyer, and close friend of Leonardo da Vinci. In his autobiography, Cardano wrote that his mother, Chiara Micheri, had taken \"various abortive medicines\" to terminate the pregnancy; he said: \"I was taken by violent means from my mother; I was almost dead.\" She was in labour for three days. Shortly before his birth, his mother had to move from Milan to Pavia to escape the Plague; her three other children died from the disease.\nAfter a depressing childhood, with frequent illnesses, and the rough upbringing by his overbearing father, in 1520, Cardano entered the University of Pavia. Against the wish of his father, who wanted his son to undertake studies of law, Girolamo felt more attracted to philosophy and science. During the Italian War of 1521\u20131526, however, the authorities in Pavia were forced to close the university in 1524. Cardano resumed his studies at the University of Padua, where he graduated with a doctorate in medicine in 1525. His eccentric and confrontational style did not earn him many friends and he had a difficult time finding work after he completed his studies. In 1525, Cardano repeatedly applied to the College of Physicians in Milan, but was not admitted owing to his combative reputation and illegitimate birth. However, he was consulted by many members of the College of Physicians, because of his irrefutable intelligence.\nEarly career as a physician.\nCardano wanted to practice medicine in a large, rich city like Milan, but he was denied a license to practice, so he settled for the town of Piove di Sacco, where he practised without a license. There, he married Lucia Banderini in 1531. Before her death in 1546, they had three children, Giovanni Battista (1534), Chiara (1537) and Aldo Urbano (1543). Cardano later wrote that those were the happiest days of his life.\nWith the help of a few noblemen, Cardano obtained a mathematics teaching position in Milan. Having finally received his medical license, he practised mathematics and medicine simultaneously, treating a few influential patients in the process. Because of this, he became one of the most sought-after doctors in Milan. In fact, by 1536, he was able to quit his teaching position, although he was still interested in mathematics. His notability in the medical field was such that the aristocracy tried to lure him out of Milan. Cardano later wrote that he turned down offers from the kings of Denmark and France, and the Queen of Scotland.\nMathematics.\nGerolamo Cardano was the first European mathematician to make systematic use of negative numbers. He published with attribution the solution of Scipione del Ferro to the cubic equation and the solution of Cardano's student Lodovico Ferrari to the quartic equation in his 1545 book \"Ars Magna\", an influential work on algebra. The solution to one particular case of the cubic equation formula_1 (in modern notation) had been communicated to him in 1539 by Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia (who later claimed that Cardano had sworn not to reveal it, and engaged Cardano in a decade-long dispute) in the form of a poem, but del Ferro's solution predated Tartaglia's. In his exposition, he acknowledged the existence of what are now called imaginary numbers, although he did not understand their properties, described for the first time by his Italian contemporary Rafael Bombelli. In \"Opus novum de proportionibus\" he introduced the binomial coefficients and the binomial theorem.\nCardano was chronically short of money and kept himself solvent by being an accomplished gambler and chess player. His book about games of chance, \"Liber de ludo aleae\" (\"Book on Games of Chance\"), written around 1564, but not published until 1663, contains the first systematic treatment of probability, as well as a section on effective cheating methods. He used the game of throwing dice to understand the basic concepts of probability. He demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes (which implies that the probability of an event is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes). He was also aware of the multiplication rule for independent events but was not certain about what values should be multiplied.\nOther contributions.\nCardano was a music theorist who studied music privately in Milan in his youth. He wrote two treatises on music, both of which were titled \"De Musica\". The first was published within his 1663 work \"Hieronymi Cardani Mediolanensis Opera Omnia\". It is of interest to scholars on the history of woodwind instruments because of its discussion of instruments from that family. The second treatise was published in 1574, and a copy of it is held in the Vatican Library. The work is valuable for studies in harmony for its discussion of the use of microtones. It is also of interest to scholars of historically informed performance practice for its details on 16th century performance. The later treatise of music \"Della natura de principii et regole musicali\" which has been attributed to Cardano by some, is according to \"The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" most likely falsely attributed to Cardano and is by another writer. Cardano also dabbled in composing, writing the motet \" Beati estis\" which is scored for 12 voices and contains four overlapping canons.\nCardano's work with hypocycloids led him to Cardan's Movement or Cardan Gear mechanism, in which a pair of gears with the smaller being one-half the size of the larger gear is used to convert rotational motion to linear motion with greater efficiency and precision than a Scotch yoke, for example. He is also credited with the invention of the Cardan suspension or gimbal.\nCardano made several contributions to hydrodynamics and held that perpetual motion is impossible, except in celestial bodies. He published two encyclopedias of natural science which contain a wide variety of inventions, facts, and occult superstitions. He also introduced the Cardan grille, a cryptographic writing tool, in 1550.\nSignificantly, in the history of education of the deaf, he said that deaf people were capable of using their minds, argued for the importance of teaching them, and was one of the first to state that deaf people could learn to read and write without learning how to speak first. He was familiar with a report by Rudolph Agricola about a deaf-mute who had learned to write.\nCardano's medical writings included: a commentary on Mundinus' anatomy and of Galen's medicine, along with the treaties \"Delle cause, dei segni e dei luoghi delle malattie\", \"Picciola terapeutica\", \"Degli abusi dei medici\" and \"Delle orine, libro quattro\".\nCardano has been credited with the invention of the so-called \"Cardano's Rings\", also called Chinese Rings, but it is very probable that they predate Cardano. The universal joint, sometimes called \"Cardan joint\", was not described by Cardano.\n\"De Subtilitate\" (1550).\nAs quoted from Charles Lyell's \"Principles of Geology\":\nThe title of a work of Cardano's, published in 1552, \"De Subtilitate\" (corresponding to what would now be called transcendental philosophy), would lead us to expect, in the chapter on minerals, many far fetched theories characteristic of that age; but when treating of petrified shells, he decided that they clearly indicated the former sojourn of the sea upon the mountains.\nScotland and Archbishop Hamilton.\nIn 1552 Cardano travelled to Scotland with the Spanish physician William Casanatus, via London, to treat the Archbishop of St Andrews who suffered of a disease that had left him speechless and was thought incurable. The treatment was a success and the diplomat Thomas Randolph recorded that \"merry tales\" about Cardano's methods were still current in Edinburgh in 1562. Cardano and Casanatus argued over the Archbishop's cure. Cardano wrote that the Archbishop had been short of breath for ten years, and after the cure was effected by his assistant, he was paid 1,400 gold crowns.\nLater years and death.\nTwo of Cardano's children \u2014 Giovanni Battista and Aldo Urbano \u2014 came to ignoble ends. Giovanni Battista, Cardano's eldest and favourite son was arrested in 1560 for having poisoned his wife, after he had discovered that their three children were not his. Giovanni was put to trial and, when Cardano could not pay the restitution demanded by the victim's family, was sentenced to death and beheaded. Gerolamo's other son Aldo Urbano was a gambler, who stole money from his father, and so Cardano disinherited him in 1569.\nCardano moved from Pavia to Bologna, in part because he believed that the decision to execute his son was influenced by Gerolamo's battles with the academic establishment in Pavia, and his colleagues' jealousy at his scientific achievements, and also because he was beset with allegations of sexual impropriety with his students. He obtained a position as professor of medicine at the University of Bologna.\nCardano was arrested by the Inquisition in 1570 after an accusation of heresy by the Inquisitor of Como, who targeted Cardano's \"De rerum varietate\" (1557). The inquisitors complained about Cardano's writings on astrology, especially his claim that self-harming religiously motivated actions of martyrs and heretics were caused by the stars. In his 1543 book \"De Supplemento Almanach\", a commentary on the astrological work \"Tetrabiblos\" by Ptolemy, Cardano had also published a horoscope of Jesus. Cardano was imprisoned for several months and lost his professorship in Bologna. He abjured and was freed, probably with help from powerful churchmen in Rome. All his non-medical works were prohibited and placed on the Index.\nHe moved to Rome, where he received a lifetime annuity from Pope Gregory XIII (after first having been rejected by Pope Pius V, who died in 1572) and finished his autobiography. He was accepted into the Royal College of Physicians, and as well as practising medicine he continued his philosophical studies until his death in 1576.\nReferences in literature and culture.\nThe seventeenth-century English physician and philosopher Sir Thomas Browne possessed the ten volumes of the Lyon 1663 edition of the complete works of Cardan in his library.\nBrowne critically viewed Cardan as:\nthat famous Physician of Milan, a great Enquirer of Truth, but too greedy a Receiver of it. He hath left many excellent Discourses, Medical, Natural, and Astrological; the most suspicious are those two he wrote by admonition in a dream, that is \"De Subtilitate &amp; Varietate Rerum\". Assuredly this learned man hath taken many things upon trust, and although examined some, hath let slip many others. He is of singular use unto a prudent Reader; but unto him that only desireth Hoties, or to replenish his head with varieties; like many others before related, either in the Original or confirmation, he may become no small occasion of Error.\nRichard Hinckley Allen tells of an amusing reference made by Samuel Butler in his book \"Hudibras\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAlessandro Manzoni's novel \"The Betrothed\" (\"I promessi sposi\") portrays a pedantic scholar of the obsolete, Don Ferrante, as a great admirer of Cardano. Significantly, he values him only for his superstitious and astrological writings; his scientific writings are dismissed because they contradict Aristotle, but excused on the ground that the author of the astrological works deserves to be listened to even when he is wrong.\nEnglish novelist E. M. Forster's \"Abinger Harvest\", a 1936 volume of essays, authorial reviews and a play, provides a sympathetic treatment of Cardano in the section titled 'The Past'. Forster believes Cardano was so absorbed in \"self-analysis that he often forgot to repent of his bad temper, his stupidity, his licentiousness, and love of revenge\" (212).\nWorks.\n\"Collected Works\".\nA chronological key to this edition is supplied by M.

{"id": "13146", "revid": "5529460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13146", "title": "Gabbro", "text": "Coarse-grained mafic intrusive rock\nGabbro ( ) is a phaneritic (coarse-grained), mafic (magnesium- and iron-rich), intrusive igneous rock formed from the slow cooling magma into a holocrystalline mass deep beneath the Earth's surface. Slow-cooling, coarse-grained gabbro has the same chemical composition and mineralogy as rapid-cooling, fine-grained basalt. Much of the Earth's oceanic crust is made of gabbro, formed at mid-ocean ridges. Gabbro is also found as plutons associated with continental volcanism. Due to its variant nature, the term \"gabbro\" may be applied loosely to a wide range of intrusive rocks, many of which are merely \"gabbroic\". By rough analogy, gabbro is to basalt as granite is to rhyolite.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"gabbro\" was used in the 1760s to name a set of rock types that were found in the ophiolites of the Apennine Mountains in Italy. It was named after Gabbro, a hamlet near Rosignano Marittimo in Tuscany. Then, in 1809, the German geologist Christian Leopold von Buch used the term more restrictively in his description of these Italian ophiolitic rocks. He assigned the name \"gabbro\" to rocks that geologists nowadays would more strictly call \"metagabbro\" (metamorphosed gabbro).\nPetrology.\nGabbro is a coarse-grained (phaneritic) igneous rock that is relatively low in silica and rich in iron, magnesium, and calcium. Such rock is described as \"mafic\". Gabbro is composed of pyroxene (mostly clinopyroxene) and calcium-rich plagioclase, with minor amounts of hornblende, olivine, orthopyroxene and accessory minerals. With significant (&gt;10%) olivine or orthopyroxene it is classified as olivine gabbro or gabbronorite respectively. Where present, hornblende is typically found as a rim around augite crystals or as large grains enclosing smaller grains of other minerals (\"poikilitic\" grains).\nGeologists use rigorous quantitative definitions to classify coarse-grained igneous rocks, based on the mineral content of the rock. For igneous rocks composed mostly of silicate minerals, and in which at least 10% of the mineral content consists of quartz, feldspar, or feldspathoid minerals, classification begins with the QAPF diagram. The relative abundances of quartz (Q), alkali feldspar (A), plagioclase (P), and feldspathoid (F), are used to plot the position of the rock on the diagram. The rock will be classified as either a gabbroid or a dioritoid if quartz makes up less than 20% of the QAPF content, feldspathoid makes up less than 10% of the QAPF content, and plagioclase makes up more than 65% of the total feldspar content. Gabbroids are distinguished from dioritoids by an anorthite (calcium plagioclase) fraction of their total plagioclase of greater than 50%.\nThe composition of the plagioclase cannot easily be determined in the field, and then a preliminary distinction is made between dioritoid and gabbroid based on the content of mafic minerals. A gabbroid typically has over 35% mafic minerals, mostly pyroxenes or olivine, while a dioritoid typically has less than 35% mafic minerals, which typically includes hornblende.\nGabbroids form a family of rock types similar to gabbro, such as monzogabbro, quartz gabbro, or nepheline-bearing gabbro. Gabbro itself is more narrowly defined, as a gabbroid in which quartz makes up less than 5% of the QAPF content, feldspathoids are not present, and plagioclase makes up more than 90% of the feldspar content. Gabbro is distinct from anorthosite, which contains less than 10% mafic minerals.\nCoarse-grained gabbroids are produced by slow crystallization of magma having the same composition as the lava that solidifies rapidly to form fine-grained (aphanitic) basalt.\nSubtypes.\nThere are a number of subtypes of gabbro recognized by geologists. Gabbros can be broadly divided into leucogabbros, with less than 35% mafic mineral content; mesogabbros, with 35% to 65% mafic mineral content; and melagabbros with more than 65% mafic mineral content. A rock with over 90% mafic mineral content will be classified instead as an ultramafic rock. A gabbroic rock with less than 10% mafic mineral content will be classified as an anorthosite.\nA more detailed classification is based on the relative percentages of plagioclase, pyroxene, hornblende, and olivine. The end members are:\nGabbros intermediate between these compositions are given names such as gabbronorite (for a gabbro intermediate between normal gabbro and norite, with almost equal amounts of clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene) or olivine gabbro (for a gabbro containing significant olivine, but almost no clinopyroxene or hornblende). A rock similar to normal gabbro but containing more orthopyroxene is called an orthopyroxene gabbro, while a rock similar to norite but containing more clinopyroxene is called a clinopyroxene norite.\nGabbros are also sometimes classified as alkali or tholleiitic gabbros, by analogy with alkali or tholeiitic basalts, of which they are considered the intrusive equivalents. Alkali gabbro usually contains olivine, nepheline, or analcime, up to 10% of the mineral content, while tholeiitic gabbro contains both clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene, making it a gabbronorite.\nGabbroids.\nGabbroids (also known as gabbroic-rocks) are a family of coarse-grained igneous rocks similar to gabbro:\nGabbroids contain minor amounts, typically a few percent, of iron-titanium oxides such as magnetite, ilmenite, and ulvospinel. Apatite, zircon, and biotite may also be present as accessory minerals.\nGabbro is generally coarse-grained, with crystals in the size range of 1\u00a0mm or larger. Finer-grained equivalents of gabbro are called diabase (also known as dolerite), although the term \"microgabbro\" is often used when extra descriptiveness is desired. Gabbro may be extremely coarse-grained to pegmatitic. Some pyroxene-plagioclase cumulates are essentially coarse-grained gabbro, and may exhibit acicular crystal habits.\nGabbro is usually equigranular in texture, although it may also show ophitic texture (with laths of plagioclase enclosed in pyroxene).\nDistribution.\nNearly all gabbros are found in plutonic bodies, and the term (as the International Union of Geological Sciences recommends) is normally restricted just to plutonic rocks, although gabbro may be found as a coarse-grained interior facies of certain thick lavas. Gabbro can be formed as a massive, uniform intrusion via in-situ crystallisation of pyroxene and plagioclase, or as part of a layered intrusion as a cumulate formed by settling of pyroxene and plagioclase. \nAn alternative name for gabbros formed by crystal settling is \"pyroxene-plagioclase adcumulate\".\nGabbro is much less common than more silica-rich intrusive rocks in the continental crust of the Earth. Gabbro and gabbroids occur in some batholiths but these rocks are relatively minor components of these very large intrusions because their iron and calcium content usually makes gabbro and gabbroid magmas too dense to have the necessary buoyancy. However, gabbro is an essential part of the oceanic crust, and can be found in many ophiolite complexes as layered gabbro underling sheeted dike complexes and overlying ultramafic rock derived from the Earth's mantle. These layered gabbros may have formed from relatively small but long-lived magma chambers underlying mid-ocean ridges.\nLayered gabbros are also characteristic of lopoliths, which are large, saucer-shaped intrusions that are primarily Precambrian in age. Prominent examples of lopoliths include the Bushveld Complex of South Africa, the Muskox intrusion of the Northwest Territories of Canada, the Rum layered intrusion of Scotland, the Stillwater complex of Montana, and the layered gabbros near Stavanger, Norway. Gabbros are also present in stocks associated with alkaline volcanism of continental rifting.\nUses.\nGabbro often contains valuable amounts of chromium, nickel, cobalt, gold, silver, platinum, and copper sulfides. For example, the Merensky Reef is the world's most important source of platinum.\nGabbro is known in the construction industry by the trade name of \"black granite\". However, gabbro is hard and difficult to work, which limits its use.\nThe term \"indigo gabbro\" is used as a common name for a mineralogically complex rock type often found in mottled tones of black and lilac-grey. It is mined in central Madagascar for use as a semi-precious stone. Indigo Gabbro can contain numerous minerals, including quartz and feldspar. Reports state that the dark matrix of the rock is composed of a mafic igneous rock, but whether this is basalt or gabbro is unclear.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Roddenberry flew 89 combat missions in the Army Air Forces during World War\u00a0II and worked as a commercial pilot after the war. Later, he joined the Los Angeles Police Department and began to write for television.\nAs a freelance writer, Roddenberry wrote scripts for \"Highway Patrol\", \"Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel\", and other series, before creating and producing his own television series, \"The Lieutenant.\" In 1964, Roddenberry created the original ' series, which premiered in 1966 and ran for three seasons. He then worked on projects including a string of failed television pilots. The syndication of \"Star Trek\" led to its growing popularity, resulting in the \"Star Trek\" feature films, which Roddenberry continued to produce and consult on. In 1987, the sequel series ' began airing on television in first-run syndication; Roddenberry was involved in the initial development but took a less active role after the first season due to ill health. He consulted on the series until his death in 1991.\nIn 1985, Roddenberry became the first TV writer with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He was later inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame and the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame. Years after his death, Roddenberry was one of the first humans to have their ashes carried into earth orbit, whereupon reentry, was lost into the Pacific Ocean. \"Star Trek\" has inspired films, books, comic books, video games and fan films set in the \"Star Trek\" universe.\nEarly life and career.\nGene Roddenberry was born on August 19, 1921, in his parents' rented home in El Paso, Texas, the first child of Eugene Edward Roddenberry and Caroline \"Glen\" (n\u00e9e\u00a0Golemon) Roddenberry. The family moved to Los Angeles in 1923 after Gene's father passed the civil service test and was given a police commission there. During his childhood, Roddenberry was interested in reading, especially pulp magazines, and was a fan of stories such as \"John Carter of Mars\", \"Tarzan\", and the \"Skylark\" series by E. E. Smith.\nAfter completing high school in 1939 at Franklin High School in Highland Park, Los Angeles , Roddenberry majored in police science at Los Angeles City College, where he began dating Eileen-Anita Rexroat and became interested in aeronautical engineering. He obtained a pilot's license through the United States Army Air Corps-sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program. He enlisted with the USAAC on December 18, 1941 and married Eileen on June 13, 1942. He graduated from the USAAC on August 5, 1942, when he was commissioned as a second lieutenant.\nHe was posted to Bellows Field, Oahu, to join the 394th Bomb Squadron, 5th Bombardment Group, of the Thirteenth Air Force, which flew the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress.\nOn August 2, 1943, while flying B-17E-BO, \"41-2463\", \"Yankee Doodle\", out of Espiritu Santo, the plane Roddenberry was piloting overran the runway by and crashed into trees, crushing the nose and starting a fire as well as killing two men: bombardier Sgt. John P. Kruger and navigator Lt. Talbert H. Woolam. The official report absolved Roddenberry of any responsibility. Roddenberry spent the remainder of his military career in the United States and flew all over the country as a plane crash investigator. He was involved in a second plane crash, this time as a passenger. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal.\nIn 1945, Roddenberry began flying for Pan American World Airways, including routes from New York to Johannesburg or Calcutta, the two longest Pan Am routes at the time. Listed as a resident of River Edge, New Jersey, he experienced his third crash while on the Clipper \"Eclipse\" on June 18, 1947. The plane came down in the Syrian Desert, and Roddenberry, who took control as the ranking flight officer, suffered two broken ribs but was able to drag injured passengers out of the burning plane and led the group to get help. Fourteen (or fifteen) people died in the crash; eleven passengers required hospital treatment (including Bishnu Charan Ghosh), and eight were unharmed. Roddenberry resigned from Pan Am on May 15, 1948, and decided to pursue his dream of writing, particularly for the new medium of television.\nRoddenberry applied for a position with the Los Angeles Police Department on January 10, 1949, and spent his first sixteen months in the traffic division before being transferred to the newspaper unit. That became the Public Information Division, and Roddenberry became the Chief of Police's speechwriter. In this position, he also became the LAPD liaison to the very popular \"Dragnet\" television series, providing technical advisors for specific episodes. He did his first TV writing for the show, boiling actual cases down to short screen treatments that would be fleshed out into full scripts by Jack Webb's staff of writers; he split the fee with the officers who investigated the real-life case. He became then technical advisor for a new television version of \"Mr. District Attorney\", which led to him writing for the show under his pseudonym \"Robert Wesley\". He began to collaborate with Ziv Television Programs and continued to sell scripts to \"Mr. District Attorney\", in addition to Ziv's \"Highway Patrol\". In early 1956, he sold two story ideas for \"I Led Three Lives\", and he found that it was becoming increasingly difficult to be a writer and a policeman. On June 7, 1956, he resigned from the force to concentrate on his writing career.\nCareer as full-time writer and producer.\nEarly career.\nRoddenberry was promoted to head writer for \"The West Point Story\" and wrote ten scripts for the first season, about a third of the total episodes. While working for Ziv, in 1956, he pitched a series to CBS set aboard a cruise ship, \"Hawaii Passage\", but they did not buy it, as he wanted to become a producer and have full creative control. He wrote another script for Ziv's series \"Harbourmaster\" titled \"Coastal Security\" and signed a contract with the company to develop a show called \"Junior Executive\" with Quinn Martin. Nothing came of the series.\nHe wrote scripts for a number of other series in his early years as a professional writer, including \"The Jane Wyman Show\", \"Bat Masterson\" and \"Jefferson Drum\". Roddenberry's episode of the series \"Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel\", \"Helen of Abajinian\", won the Writers Guild of America award for Best Teleplay in 1958. He also continued to create series of his own, including a series based on an agent for Lloyd's of London called \"The Man from Lloyds\". He pitched a police-based series called \"Footbeat\" to CBS, Hollis Productions, and Screen Gems. It nearly made it into ABC's Sunday-night lineup, but they opted to show only Western series that night.\nRoddenberry was asked to write a series called \"Riverboat\", set in 1860s Mississippi. When he discovered that the producers wanted no black people on the show, he argued so much with them that he lost the job. He also considered moving to England around this time, as Lew Grade wanted Roddenberry to develop series and set up his own production company. Though he did not move, he leveraged the deal to land a contract with Screen Gems that included a guaranteed $100,000, and became a producer for the first time on a summer replacement for \"The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show\" titled \"Wrangler\".\nScreen Gems backed Roddenberry's first attempt at creating a pilot. His series, \"The Wild Blue\", went to pilot, but was not picked up. The three main characters had names that later appeared in the \"Star Trek\" series: Philip Pike, Edward Jellicoe, and James T. Irvine. While working at Screen Gems, an actress, new to Hollywood, wrote to him asking for a meeting. They quickly became friends and met every few months; the woman was Majel Leigh Hudec, later known as Majel Barrett. He created a second pilot called \"333 Montgomery\" about a lawyer, played by DeForest Kelley. It was not picked up by the network but was later rewritten as a new series called \"Defiance County\". His career with Screen Gems ended in late 1961, and shortly afterward, he had issues with his old friend Erle Stanley Gardner. The \"Perry Mason\" creator claimed that \"Defiance County\" had infringed his character Doug Selby. The two writers fell out via correspondence and stopped contacting one another, though \"Defiance County\" never proceeded past the pilot stage. The project finally wound up as the NBC series \"Sam Benedict\" with Edmond O'Brien in the title role, produced by MGM. E. Jack Neuman took the creator's credit, claiming the character was based on real-life San Francisco lawyer Jake Ehrlich.\nIn 1961, he agreed to appear in an advertisement for MONY (Mutual of New York) as long as he had final approval. With the money from Screen Gems and other works, he and Eileen moved to 539 South Beverly Glen, near Beverly Hills. He discussed an idea about a multi-ethnic crew on an airship traveling the world, based on the film \"Master of the World\" (1961), with fellow writer Christopher Knopf at MGM. As the time was not right for science fiction, he began work on \"The Lieutenant\" for Arena Productions. This made it to the NBC Saturday night lineup at 7:30\u00a0pm and premiered on September 14, 1963. The show set a new ratings record for the time slot. Roddenberry worked with several cast and crew who would later join him on \"Star Trek\", including Gene L. Coon, star Gary Lockwood, Joe D'Agosta, Leonard Nimoy, Nichelle Nichols, and Majel Barrett.\n\"The Lieutenant\" was produced with the co-operation of the Pentagon, which allowed them to film at an actual Marine base. During the production of the series Roddenberry clashed regularly with the Department of Defense over potential plots. The department withdrew its support after Roddenberry pressed ahead with a plot titled \"To Set It Right\" in which a white and a black man find a common cause in their roles as Marines. \"To Set It Right\" was the first time he worked with Nichols, and it was her first television role. The episode has been preserved at the Museum of Television and Radio in New York City. The show was not renewed after its first season. Roddenberry was already working on a new series idea. This included his ship location from \"Hawaii Passage\" and added a Horatio Hornblower character, plus the multiracial crew from his airship idea. He decided to write it as science fiction, and by March 11, 1964, he brought together a 16-page pitch. On April 24, he sent three copies and two dollars to the Writers Guild of America to register his series. He called it \"Star Trek\".\n\"Star Trek\".\nWhen Roddenberry pitched \"Star Trek\" to MGM, it was warmly received, but no offer was made. He then went to Desilu Productions, but rather than being offered a one-script deal, he was hired as a producer and allowed to work on his own projects. His first was a half-hour pilot called \"Police Story\" (not to be confused with the anthology series created by Joseph Wambaugh), which was not picked up by the networks. Having not sold a pilot in five years, Desilu was having financial difficulties; its only success was \"The Lucy Show\". Roddenberry took the \"Star Trek\" idea to Oscar Katz, head of programming, and the duo immediately started work on a plan to sell the series to the networks. They took it to CBS, which ultimately passed on it. The duo later learned that CBS had been eager to find out about \"Star Trek\" because it had a science fiction series in development\u2014\"Lost in Space\". Roddenberry and Katz next took the idea to Mort Werner at NBC, this time downplaying the science fiction elements and highlighting the links to \"Gunsmoke\" and \"Wagon Train.\" The network funded three story ideas and selected \"The Menagerie\", which was later known as \"\", to be made into a pilot. (The other two later became episodes of the series.) While most of the money for the pilot came from NBC, the remaining costs were covered by Desilu. Roddenberry hired Dorothy Fontana, better known as D. C. Fontana, as his assistant. They had worked together previously on \"The Lieutenant,\" and she had eight script credits to her name.\nRoddenberry and Barrett had begun an affair by the early days of \"Star Trek\", and he specifically wrote the part of the character Number One in the pilot with her in mind; no other actresses were considered for the role. Barrett suggested Nimoy for the part of Spock. He had worked with both Roddenberry and Barrett on \"The Lieutenant\", and once Roddenberry remembered the thin features of the actor, he did not consider anyone else for the part. The remaining cast came together; filming began on November 27, 1964, and was completed on December 11. After post-production, the episode was shown to NBC executives, and it was rumored that \"Star Trek\" would be broadcast at 8:00\u00a0pm on Friday nights. The episode failed to impress test audiences, and after the executives became hesitant, Katz offered to make a second pilot. On March 26, 1965, NBC ordered a new episode.\nRoddenberry developed several possible scripts, including \"Mudd's Women\", \"The Omega Glory\", and with the help of Samuel A. Peeples, \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\". NBC selected the last one, leading to later rumors that Peeples created \"Star Trek\", something he always denied. Roddenberry was determined to make the crew racially diverse, which impressed actor George Takei when he came for his audition. The episode went into production on July 15, 1965, and was completed at around half the cost of \"The Cage\", since the sets were already built. Roddenberry worked on several projects for the rest of the year. In December, he decided to write lyrics to the \"Star Trek\" theme; this angered the theme's composer, Alexander Courage, as it meant that royalties would be split between them. In February 1966, NBC informed Desilu that they were buying \"Star Trek\" and that it would be included in the fall 1966 television schedule.\nOn May 24, the first episode of the \"Star Trek\" series went into production; Desilu was contracted to deliver 13 episodes. Five days before the first broadcast, Roddenberry appeared at the 24th World Science Fiction Convention and previewed \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\". After the episode was shown, he received a standing ovation. The first episode to air on NBC was \"The Man Trap\", on September 8, 1966, at 8:00\u00a0pm. Roddenberry was immediately concerned about the series' low ratings and wrote to Harlan Ellison to ask if he could use his name in letters to the network to save the show. Not wanting to lose a potential source of income, Ellison agreed and also sought the help of other writers who also wanted to avoid losing potential income. Roddenberry corresponded with science fiction writer Isaac Asimov about how to address the issue of Spock's growing popularity and the possibility that his character would overshadow Kirk. Asimov suggested having Kirk and Spock work together as a team \"to get people to think of Kirk when they think of Spock.\" The series was renewed by NBC, first for a full season's order, and then for a second season. An article in the \"Chicago Tribune\" quoted studio executives as stating that the letter-writing campaign had been wasted because they had already been planning to renew \"Star Trek\".\nRoddenberry often rewrote submitted scripts, although he did not always take credit for these. Roddenberry and Ellison fell out over \"The City on the Edge of Forever\" after Roddenberry rewrote Ellison's script to make it both financially feasible to film and usable for the series context. Even his close friend Don Ingalls had his script for \"A Private Little War\" altered drastically, and as a result, Ingalls declared that he would only be credited under the pseudonym \"Jud Crucis\" (a play on \"Jesus Christ\"), claiming he had been crucified by the process. Roddenberry's work rewriting \"\", based on footage originally shot for \"The Cage\", resulted in a Writers Guild arbitration board hearing. The Guild ruled in his favor over John D. F. Black, the complainant. The script won a Hugo Award, but the awards board neglected to inform Roddenberry, who found out through correspondence with Asimov.\nAs the second season was drawing to a close, Roddenberry once again faced the threat of cancellation. He enlisted the help of Asimov, and even encouraged a student-led protest march on NBC. On January 8, 1968, a thousand students from 20 schools marched on the studio. Roddenberry began to communicate with \"Star Trek\" fan Bjo Trimble, who led a fan-writing campaign to save the series. Trimble later noted that this campaign of writing to fans who had written to Desilu about the show, urging them to write NBC, had created an organized \"Star Trek\" fandom. The network received around 6,000 letters a week from fans petitioning it to renew the series. On March 1, 1968, NBC announced on air, at the end of \"The Omega Glory\", that \"Star Trek\" would return for a third season.\nThe network had initially planned to place \"Star Trek\" in the 7:30\u00a0pm Monday-night time slot freed up by \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" completing its run. That would have meant \"Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In\" had to start a half-hour later (moving from 9:00 to 9:30). Powerful \"Laugh-In\" producer George Schlatter objected to his highly rated show yielding its slot to the poorly-rated \"Star Trek\". Instead, \"Laugh-In\" retained the slot, and \"Star Trek\" was moved to 10:00\u00a0pm on Fridays. Realizing the show could not survive in that time slot and burned out from arguments with the network, Roddenberry resigned from the day-to-day running of \"Star Trek\", although he continued to be credited as executive producer. Roddenberry cooperated with Stephen Edward Poe, writing as Stephen Whitfield, on the 1968 non-fiction book \"The Making of Star Trek\" for Ballantine Books, splitting the royalties evenly. Roddenberry explained to Whitfield: \"I had to get some money somewhere. I'm sure not going to get it from the profits of \"Star Trek\".\" Herbert Solow and Robert H. Justman observed that Whitfield never regretted his 50\u201350 deal with Roddenberry, since it gave him \"the opportunity to become the first chronicler of television's successful unsuccessful series.\" Whitfield had previously been the national advertising and promotion director for model makers Aluminum Model Toys, better known as \"AMT\", which then held the \"Star Trek\" license, and moved to run Lincoln Enterprises, Roddenberry's company set up to sell the series' merchandise.\nHaving stepped aside from the majority of his \"Star Trek\" duties, Roddenberry sought instead to create a film based on Asimov's \"I, Robot\" and also began work on a \"Tarzan\" script for National General Pictures. After initially requesting a budget of $2 million and being refused, Roddenberry made cuts to reduce costs to $1.2 million. When he learned they were being offered only $700,000 to shoot the film, which by now was being called a TV movie, he canceled the deal. NBC announced \"Star Trek\"'s cancellation in February 1969. A similar but much smaller letter-writing campaign followed news of the cancellation. Because of the manner in which the series was sold to NBC, it left the production company $4.7 million in debt. The last episode of \"Star Trek\" aired 47 days before Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon as part of the Apollo 11 mission, and Roddenberry declared that he would never write for television again.\n1970s projects.\nAfter the cancellation of \"Star Trek,\" Roddenberry felt typecast as a producer of science fiction, despite his background in Westerns and police stories. He later described the period, saying, \"My dreams were going downhill because I could not get work after the original series was cancelled.\" He felt that he was \"perceived as the guy who made the show that was an expensive flop.\" Roddenberry had sold his interest in \"Star Trek\" to Paramount Studios in return for a third of the profits but this did not result in any quick financial gain; the studio was still claiming that the series was $500,000 in the red in 1982.\nHe wrote and produced \"Pretty Maids All in a Row\" (1971), a sexploitation film directed by Roger Vadim, for MGM. The cast included Rock Hudson, Angie Dickinson, Telly Savalas, and Roddy McDowall alongside \"Star Trek\" regular James Doohan and notable guest star William Campbell, who had appeared in \"The Squire Of Gothos\" and \"The Trouble with Tribbles\". \"Variety\" was unimpressed: \"Whatever substance was in the original [novel by Francis Pollini] or screen concept has been plowed under, leaving only superficial, one-joke results.\" Herbert Solow had given Roddenberry the work as a favor, paying him $100,000 for the script.\nFaced with a mortgage and a $2,000-per-month alimony obligation as a result of his 1969 divorce, he retained a booking agent (with the assistance of his friend Arthur C. Clarke) and began to support himself largely by scheduling appearances at colleges and science fiction conventions. These presentations typically included screenings of \"The Cage\" and blooper reels from the production of \"Star Trek.\" The conventions began to build the fan support to bring back \"Star Trek,\" leading \"TV Guide\" to describe it, in 1972, as \"the show that won't die.\"\nIn 1972 and 1973, Roddenberry made a comeback to science fiction, selling ideas for four new series to a variety of networks. Roddenberry's \"Genesis II\" was set in a post-apocalyptic Earth. He had hoped to recreate the success of \"Star Trek\" without \"doing another space-hopping show.\" He created a 45-page writing guide, and proposed several story ideas based on the concept that pockets of civilisation had regressed to past eras or changed altogether. The pilot aired as a TV movie in March 1973, setting new records for the \"Thursday Night Movie of the Week\". Roddenberry was asked to produce four more scripts for episodes, but before production could begin again, CBS aired the film \"Planet of the Apes.\" It was watched by an even greater audience than \"Genesis II.\" CBS scrapped \"Genesis II\" and replaced it with a television series based on the film; the results were disastrous from a ratings standpoint, and \"Planet of the Apes\" was canceled after 14 episodes.\n\"The Questor Tapes\" project reunited him with his \"Star Trek\" collaborator, Gene L. Coon, who was in poor health. NBC ordered 16 episodes, and tentatively scheduled the series to follow \"The Rockford Files\" on Friday nights; the pilot launched on January 23, 1974, to positive critical response, but Roddenberry balked at the substantial changes requested by the network and left the project, leading to its immediate cancellation. During 1974, Roddenberry reworked the \"Genesis II\" concept as a second pilot, \"Planet Earth,\" for rival network ABC, with similar less-than-successful results. The pilot was aired on April 23, 1974. While Roddenberry wanted to create something that could feasibly exist in the future, the network wanted stereotypical science-fiction women and were unhappy when that was not delivered. Roddenberry was not involved in a third reworking of the material by ABC that produced \"Strange New World.\" He began developing \"MAGNA I,\" an underwater science-fiction series, for 20th Century Fox Television. By the time the work on the script was complete, though, those who had approved the project had left Fox and their replacements were not interested in the project. A similar fate was faced by \"Tribunes,\" a science-fiction police series, which Roddenberry attempted to get off the ground between 1973 and 1977. He gave up after four years; the series never even reached the pilot stage.\nIn 1974, Roddenberry was paid $25,000 by John Whitmore to write a script called \"The Nine\". Intended to be about Andrija Puharich's parapsychological research, it evolved into a frank exploration of his experiences attempting to earn a living attending science fiction conventions. At the time, he was again close to losing his house because of a lack of income. The pilot \"Spectre,\" Roddenberry's 1977 attempt to create an occult detective duo similar to Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, was released as a television movie within the United States and received a limited theatrical release in the United Kingdom.\n\"Star Trek\" revival.\nLacking funds in the early 1970s, Roddenberry was unable to buy the full rights to \"Star Trek\" for $150,000 ($\u00a0million in 2024) from Paramount. Lou Scheimer approached Paramount in 1973 about creating an animated \"Star Trek\" series. Credited as \"executive consultant\" and paid $2,500 per episode, Roddenberry was granted full creative control of \"\". Although he read all the scripts and \"sometimes [added] touches of his own\", he relinquished most of his authority to \"de facto\" showrunner/associate producer D. C. Fontana.\nRoddenberry had some difficulties with the cast. To save money, he sought not to hire George Takei and Nichelle Nichols. He neglected to inform Leonard Nimoy of this and instead, to get him to sign on, told him that he was the only member of the main cast not returning. After Nimoy discovered the deception, he demanded that Takei and Nichols play Sulu and Uhura when their characters appeared on screen; Roddenberry acquiesced. He had been promised five full seasons of the new show but ultimately, only one and a half were produced.\nVociferous fan support (6,000 attended the second New York \"Star Trek\" convention in 1973 and 15,000 attended in 1974, eclipsing the more established array of approximately 3,600 fans and industry professionals who attended the 32nd World Science Fiction Convention in Washington, D.C. in 1974) led Paramount to hire Roddenberry to create and produce a feature film based on the franchise in May 1975. The studio was unimpressed with the ideas being put forward; John D. F. Black's opinion was that their ideas were never \"big enough\" for the studio, even when one scenario involved the end of the universe. Several ideas were partly developed including ' and '. Following the commercial reception of \"Star Wars\", in June 1977, Paramount instead green-lit a new series set in the franchise titled \"\", with Roddenberry and most of the original cast, except Nimoy, set to reprise their respective roles.\nIt was to be the anchor show of a proposed Paramount-owned \"fourth network\", but plans for the network were scrapped and the project was reworked into a feature film. The result, \"\", troubled the studio because of budgetary concerns, but it was a box-office hit. Adjusted for inflation, it was the third-highest-grossing \"Star Trek\" movie, with the 2009 film coming in first and the 2013 film second.\nIn 1980, Roddenberry submitted a treatment for a proposed sequel about the crew preventing the alien Klingons from thwarting the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Mindful of the tumult that suffused the production of \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\", Paramount rejected the proposal. After he was replaced on the project by television producer Harve Bennett, Roddenberry was named \"executive consultant\" for the project, a position he retained for subsequent Star Trek franchise films produced during his lifetime. Under this arrangement, he was compensated with a producer's fee and a percentage of the net profits of the film in exchange for proffering non-binding story notes and corresponding with the fan community; much to his chagrin, these memos were largely disregarded by Bennett and other producers. An initial script for \" was circulated to eight people; Bennett attributed the subsequent plot leak of the death of Spock to Roddenberry. About 20% of the plot was based on Roddenberry's ideas.\nRoddenberry was involved in creating the television series \", which premiered with \"Encounter at Farpoint\" on September 28, 1987. He was given a bonus of $1 million (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024) in addition to a salary to produce the series, and celebrated by purchasing a new Rolls-Royce for $100,000. The arrangement did not entitle him to be executive producer of the series. Paramount was already concerned about the original cast not returning, and fearing fan reaction if Roddenberry was not involved, agreed to his demand for control of the show. Roddenberry rewrote the series bible from an original version by David Gerrold, who had previously written \"The Original Series\" episode \"The Trouble with Tribbles\", and \"The Animated Series\" follow-up, \"More Tribbles, More Troubles\".\nAccording to producer Rick Berman, Roddenberry's involvement in \"The Next Generation\" \"diminished greatly\" after the first season, but the nature of his increasingly peripheral role was not disclosed because of the value of his name to fans. While Berman said that Roddenberry had \"all but stopped writing and rewriting\" by the end of the third season, his final writing credit on the show (a co-teleplay credit) actually occurred considerably earlier, appearing on \"Datalore\", the 13th episode of the first season.\nAlthough commercially successful from its inception, the series was initially marred by Writers Guild of America grievances from Fontana and Gerrold, both of whom left the series in acrimonious circumstances; frequent turnover among the writing staff (24 staff writers left the show during its first three seasons, triple the average attrition rate for such series); and allegations that Roddenberry attorney Leonard Maizlish had become the producer's \"point man and proxy\", ghostwriting memos, sitting in on meetings, and contributing to scripts despite not being on staff. Writer Tracy Torm\u00e9 described the first few seasons of \"The Next Generation\" under Roddenberry as an \"insane asylum\".\nIn 1990, Nicholas Meyer was brought in to direct the sixth film in the series: \"\". Creatively, Meyer clashed with Roddenberry, who felt that having the \"Enterprise\" crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer described a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying\nHis guys were lined up on one side of the room, and my guys were lined up on the other side of the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt I'd behaved very well, very diplomatically. I came out of it feeling not very good, and I've not felt good about it ever since. He was not well, and maybe there were more tactful ways of dealing with it, because at the end of the day, I was going to go out and make the movie. I didn't have to take him on. Not my finest hour.\nIn Joel Engel's biography, \"Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek\", he states that Roddenberry watched \"The Undiscovered Country\" alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a \"good job\". In contrast, Nimoy and Shatner's memoirs report that after the screening, Roddenberry called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused.\nRoddenberry wrote the novelization of \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\". Although it has been incorrectly attributed to several other authors (most notably Alan Dean Foster), it was the first in a series of hundreds of \"Star Trek\"-based novels to be published by the Pocket Books imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster, whose parent company also owned Paramount Pictures Corporation. Previously, Roddenberry worked intermittently on \"The God Thing\", a proposed novel based upon his rejected 1975 screenplay for a proposed low-budget ($3 to $5 million) \"Star Trek\" film preceding the development of \"Phase II\" throughout 1976. Attempts to complete the project by Walter Koenig, Susan Sackett, Fred Bronson, and Michael Jan Friedman have proven to be unfeasible for a variety of legal and structural reasons.\nPersonal life.\nWhile at Los Angeles City College, Roddenberry began dating Eileen-Anita Rexroat. They became engaged before Roddenberry left Los Angeles during his military service, and they married on June 20, 1942, at the chapel at Kelly Field. They had two daughters, Darleen Anita and Dawn Allison. During his time in the LAPD, Roddenberry was known to have had affairs with secretarial staff. Before his work on \"Star Trek\", he began relationships with Nichelle Nichols and Majel Barrett. Nichols wrote about their relationship in her autobiography \"Beyond Uhura\" only after Roddenberry's death. At the time, Roddenberry wanted to remain in an open relationship with both women, but Nichols, recognizing Barrett's devotion to him, ended the affair as she did not want to be \"the other woman to the other woman\".\nBarrett and Roddenberry had an apartment together by the opening weeks of \"Star Trek\". He had planned to divorce Eileen after the first season of the show, but when the show was renewed, he delayed doing so, fearing that he would not have enough time to deal with both the divorce and \"Star Trek\". He moved out of the family home on August\u00a09, 1968, two weeks after the marriage of his daughter Darleen. In 1969, while scouting locations in Japan for MGM for \"Pretty Maids All in a Row\", he proposed to Barrett by telephone. They were married in a Shinto ceremony, as Roddenberry had considered it \"sacrilegious\" to have an American minister in Japan perform the ceremony. Roddenberry and Barrett had a son together, Eugene Jr., commonly and professionally known as Rod Roddenberry, in February 1974.\nFrom 1975 until his death, Roddenberry maintained an extramarital relationship with his executive assistant, Susan Sackett.\nReligious views.\nRoddenberry grew up a Southern Baptist; however, as an adult, he rejected religion, and considered himself a humanist. He began questioning religion around the age of 14, and came to the conclusion that it was \"nonsense\". As a child, he served in the choir at his local church, but often substituted lyrics as he sang hymns. Early in his writing career, he received an award from the American Baptist Convention for \"skillfully writing Christian truth and the application of Christian principles into commercial, dramatic TV scripts\". For several years, he corresponded with John M. Gunn of the National Council of Churches regarding the application of Christian teachings in television series. However, Gunn stopped replying after Roddenberry wrote in a letter: \"But you must understand that I am a complete pagan, and consume enormous amounts of bread, having found the Word more spice than nourishment, so I am interested in a statement couched in dollars and cents of what this means to the Roddenberry treasury.\"\nRoddenberry said of Christianity, \"How can I take seriously a God-image that requires that I prostrate myself every seven days and praise it? That sounds to me like a very insecure personality.\" At one point, he worked a similar opinion, which was to have been stated by a Vulcan, into the plot for \"Star Trek: The God Thing\". He had a similar disdain for Judaism. Despite working closely with Jewish writers and stars such as Shatner, Nimoy, and Koenig for the series, Nimoy said of Roddenberry, \"Gene was antisemitic, clearly,\" qualifying that Roddenberry was anti-religious, seeing Jews as a religious group, adding \"but I saw examples not only of [Roddenberry] practicing antisemitism, but of him being callous about other peoples' differences as well.\u201d As with Christianity, Roddenberry similarly dismissed that there were any deliberately Jewish principles or allusions included in \"Star Trek\", telling a journalist, \"You Jews have a lamentable habit of identifying those characteristics in a society that you deem positive and then taking credit for inventing them.\u201d\nBefore his death, Roddenberry became close friends with philosopher Charles Mus\u00e8s, who said that Roddenberry's views were \"a far cry from atheism\". Roddenberry explained his position thus: \"It's not true that I don't believe in God. I believe in a kind of God. It's just not other people's God. I reject religion. I accept the notion of God.\" He had an ongoing interest in other people's experiences with religion, and called Catholicism \"a very beautiful religion. An art form.\" However, he said that he dismissed all organized religions, saying that for the most part, they acted like a \"substitute brain... and a very malfunctioning one\". Roddenberry was also critical of how the public looked at certain religions, noting that when the King David Hotel bombing took place in 1946, the American public accepted it as the action of freedom fighters, whereas a car bombing by a Muslim in Beirut is condemned as a terrorist act. While he agreed that both parties were wrong in their use of violence, he said that the actions of both were undertaken because of their strong religious beliefs.\nAccording to Ronald D. Moore, Roddenberry \"felt very strongly that contemporary Earth religions would be gone by the 23rd century\". Brannon Braga said that Roddenberry made it known to the writers of \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" that religion, superstition, and mystical thinking were not to be included. Even a mention of marriage in a script for an early episode of \"The Next Generation\" resulted in Roddenberry's chastising the writers. Nicholas Meyer said that \"Star Trek\" had evolved \"into sort of a secular parallel to the Catholic Mass\". Roddenberry compared the franchise to his own philosophy by saying: \"Understand that \"Star Trek\" is more than just my political philosophy, my racial philosophy, my overview on life and the human condition.\" He was awarded the 1991 Humanist Arts Award from the American Humanist Association.\nDecline in health and death.\nIn the late 1980s, it was likely that Roddenberry was afflicted by the first manifestations of cerebrovascular disease and encephalopathy as a result of his longstanding recreational use of legal and illicit drugs, including alcohol, methaqualone, methylphenidate, Dexamyl, and cocaine (which he had used regularly since the production of \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\"). Roddenberry also used cannabis for many years, although its cumulative impact on his health remains unclear. Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially amphetamines. The effects of these substances were compounded by deleterious interactions with diabetes, high blood pressure, and antidepressant prescriptions.\nRoddenberry had a stroke at a family reunion in Tallahassee, Florida, in September 1989, His health declined further, ultimately requiring him to use a wheelchair. His right arm was paralyzed after another stroke in early October 1991, causing him ongoing pain as the muscles began to atrophy. It also caused problems with the sight in his right eye, and he found communicating in full sentences difficult. At 2:00\u00a0pm, on October 24, he attended an appointment with his doctor, Dr. Ronald Rich, in Santa Monica, California. He arrived in the building with his staff and began to travel up to the ninth floor in the elevator. As they reached the fifth floor, he began struggling to breathe and was wheeled into the doctor's office, where he was reclined, and a nurse administered oxygen. Barrett was sent for. Upon her arrival, she held Roddenberry while encouraging him to breathe. He suffered cardiopulmonary arrest in the doctor's office shortly afterwards. CPR was attempted with no effect, and paramedics arrived to take him across the road to the Santa Monica Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. He was 70 years old.\nThe funeral was arranged for November 1, with the public invited to the memorial service at the Hall of Liberty, within the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in Hollywood Hills. It was a secular service; Roddenberry had been cremated before the event. More than 300 \"Star Trek\" fans attended and stood in the balcony section of the hall, while the invited guests were on the floor level. Nichelle Nichols sang twice during the ceremony, first \"Yesterday\", and then a song she wrote herself titled \"Gene\". Both songs had been requested by Barrett. Several people spoke at the memorial, including Ray Bradbury, Whoopi Goldberg, E. Jack Neuman, and Patrick Stewart. The ceremony was closed by two kilted pipers playing \"Amazing Grace\" as a recorded message by Roddenberry was broadcast. A four-plane flypast, in the missing man formation, followed some 30 minutes later. After his death, \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" aired a two-part episode of season five, called \"\", which featured a dedication to Roddenberry.\nRoddenberry's will left the majority of his $30 million estate to Barrett in a trust. He also left money to his children and his first wife, Eileen. However, his daughter Dawn contested the will, on the grounds that Barrett had undue influence on her father. In a hearing held in 1993, the Los Angeles Superior Court ruled that improprieties existed in the management of the trust and removed Barrett as executor. In another decision, the court found that Roddenberry had hidden assets from \"Star Trek\" in the Norway Corporation to keep funds away from his first wife, and ordered the payment of 50% of those assets to Eileen, as well as punitive damages. In 1996, the California Court of Appeals ruled that the original will, which stated that anyone who contested it would be disinherited, would stand. As a result, Dawn lost $500,000 from the estate, as well as a share of the trust upon Barrett's death. The appellate court also overturned the earlier decision to award Roddenberry's first wife, Eileen, 50% of his assets. The judge called that decision one \"that should never have been\".\nSpaceflight.\nIn 1992, some of Roddenberry's ashes were flown into space, and returned to Earth, on the Space Shuttle \"Columbia\" mission STS-52. On April 21, 1997, a Celestis spacecraft with of the cremated remains of Roddenberry, along with those of Timothy Leary, Gerard K. O'Neill and 21 other people, was launched into Earth orbit as part of the Minisat 01 mission aboard a Pegasus XL rocket from a location near the Canary Islands.\nOn May 20, 2002, the spacecraft's orbit deteriorated and it disintegrated in the atmosphere. Another flight to launch more of his ashes into deep space, along with those of Barrett, who died in 2008, was initially planned to take place in 2009. Unlike previous flights, the intention was that the flight would not return burning up in the Earth's atmosphere. The payload would include the ashes of James Doohan in addition to the Roddenberrys' and several others and was scheduled to fly in 2016 on the Sunjammer solar sail experiment, but the project was canceled in 2014. Celestis rescheduled their launch for 2020, then later rescheduled for June 2022, the next available commercial mission to deep space. A sample of the couple's cremated remains will be sealed into a specially made capsule designed to withstand space travel. A spacecraft will carry the capsule, along with digitized tributes from fans, on Celestis' \"Enterprise Flight\". The flight will also contain the ashes of Nichelle Nichols and Douglas Trumbull. The Celestis \"Enterprise Flight\" was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on January 8, 2024, very fittingly on a rocket named Vulcan.\nLegacy.\nIn 1985, Gene Roddenberry was the first television writer to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. When the Sci-Fi Channel was launched, the first broadcast was a dedication to two \"science fiction pioneers\": Isaac Asimov and Roddenberry. The Roddenberry crater on Mars is named after him, as is the asteroid 4659 Roddenberry. Roddenberry and \"Star Trek\" have been cited as inspiration for other science fiction franchises, with George Lucas crediting the series for enabling \"Star Wars\" to be produced. J. Michael Straczynski, creator of the \"Babylon 5\" franchise, appreciated \"Star Trek\" amongst other science fiction series and \"what they had to say about who we are, and where we are going.\"\nDavid Alexander collaborated with Roddenberry on a biography over two decades. Titled \"Star Trek Creator\", it was published in 1995. Yvonne Fern's book \"Gene Roddenberry: The Last Conversation\" detailed a series of conversations she had with Roddenberry over the last months of his life. In October 2002, a plaque was placed at Roddenberry's birthplace in El Paso, Texas. The El Paso Independent School District named the 40-foot, 120-seat Roddenberry Planetarium in his honor. The planetarium was recently upgraded and relocated to northeast El Paso. The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Roddenberry in 2007, and the Television Academy Hall of Fame in January 2010.\nCommemorating Roddenberry's 100th birthday in August 2021, NASA used its Deep Space Network to transmit a 1976 recording of Roddenberry towards the direction of the star system 40 Eridani (the host of the fictional planet Vulcan). The signal will reach the star in early 2038.\nIn September 2023, a genus of spiders, \"Roddenberryus\", was named after him. The two researchers stated thet he \"inspired generations of kids to pursue scientific careers\".\nPosthumous television series.\n' was already in development when Roddenberry died. Berman said that while he never discussed the ideas for the series, he was given a blessing by Roddenberry to pursue it. Berman later said, \"I don't believe the 24th century is going to be like Gene Roddenberry believed it to be, that people will be free from poverty and greed. But if you're going to write and produce for \"Star Trek\", you've got to buy into that.\" In early 1996, Majel Barret-Roddenberry uncovered scripts for a series called \"Battleground Earth\". The project was sent to distributors by the Creative Artists Agency, and it was picked up by Tribune Entertainment, which set the budget at over $1 million per episode. The series was renamed ' before launch, and premiered in 1997, six years after Gene's death; it ran for five seasons and 110 episodes until 2002.\nTwo further series ideas were developed from Roddenberry's notes, \"Genesis II\" and \"Andromeda\". After an initial order for two seasons, 110 episodes of \"Andromeda\" were aired over five seasons from 2000 to 2005. Tribune also worked on another Roddenberry series. Titled \"Starship\"; the production company aimed to launch it via the network route rather than into syndication. Rod Roddenberry, president of Roddenberry Productions, announced in 2010, at his father's posthumous induction into the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame, that he was aiming to take \"The Questor Tapes\" to television. Rod was developing the series alongside Imagine Television. Rod would go on to create the two-hour television movie \"Trek Nation\" regarding the impact of his father's work.\nAwards and nominations.\nThe majority of the awards and nominations received by Roddenberry throughout his career were related to \"Star Trek\". He was credited for \"Star Trek\" during the nominations for two Emmy Awards, and won two Hugo Awards. One Hugo was a special award for the series, while another was for \"The Menagerie\", the episode that used footage from the original unaired pilot for \"Star Trek\", \"The Cage\". In addition, he was awarded the Brotherhood Award by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People for his work in the advancement of African American characters on television. \"Star Trek\", ended in 1969; he was nominated for Hugo Awards for \"Genesis II\" and \"The Questor Tapes\". in 1974 and 1975, respectively. After his death in 1991, he was posthumously awarded the Robert A. Heinlein Memorial Award by the National Space Society and The George Pal Memorial Award at the Saturn Awards, as well as the Exceptional Public Service Medal by NASA.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13149", "revid": "50599176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13149", "title": "Galaxy Quest", "text": "1999 film by Dean Parisot\nGalaxy Quest is a 1999 American satirical science fiction comedy film directed by Dean Parisot and written by David Howard and Robert Gordon. It stars Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell, and Daryl Mitchell. A parody and homage to science-fiction films and series, especially \"Star Trek\" and its fandom, the film depicts the cast of a fictional cult television series, \"Galaxy Quest\", who are drawn into a real interstellar conflict by aliens who think the series is a documentary.\n\"Galaxy Quest\" was a box office success and received positive reviews. It won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and the Nebula Award for Best Script, and was nominated for ten Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film and Best Director, Best Actress for Weaver, and Best Supporting Actor for Rickman; Allen won Best Actor.\n\"Galaxy Quest\" achieved cult status, especially from \"Star Trek\" fans for its affectionate parody. Several \"Star Trek\" cast and crew members praised the film. It was included in \"Reader's Digest\"'s list of the Top 100+ Funniest Movies of All Time in 2012, and \"Star Trek\" fans voted it the seventh-best \"Star Trek\" film in 2013.\nPlot.\nThe cast of the 1980s space-adventure series \"Galaxy Quest\" attend fan conventions and make trivial promotional appearances. Though the series' former star, Jason Nesmith, thrives on the attention, his co-stars Gwen DeMarco, Alexander Dane, Fred Kwan, and Tommy Webber resent him and the states of their careers. At a convention, a group calling themselves Thermians approaches Jason for help. Thinking they want him for a promotional appearance, he agrees. The next morning, when they pick him up, a hungover Jason does not grasp that the Thermians are actual aliens who have transported him to a working re-creation of the \"Galaxy Quest\" starship, the NSEA \"Protector\". Jason believes he is on a set, and performs in character as he confronts the Thermians' enemy, Sarris, who demands the \"Omega 13\", a secret super weapon with unknown capabilities mentioned in the show's finale, but never used on screen. Giving perfunctory orders, Jason manages to temporarily defeat Sarris.\nAfter the grateful Thermians transport him back to Earth, Jason realizes the experience was real and attempts to convince the other cast members. When the Thermian Laliari seeks Jason's help again, the cast joins him, along with the convention emcee, Guy, who had played an ill-fated extra in one episode. Aboard the \"Protector\", the cast learn that the Thermians, who possess no concept of fiction, believe the episodes of \"Galaxy Quest\" are true \"historical documents\". Inspired by the crew's adventures, they have based their society on the virtues espoused by the show.\nSarris returns and demands the \"Omega 13\" device. He attacks the \"Protector\" again, and the ship barely escapes through a magnetic minefield. However, the ship's power source, a beryllium sphere, is severely damaged. The humans travel to a nearby planet and take a replacement sphere from ferocious, childlike alien miners. Jason is temporarily left behind and fends off a rock creature until Fred beams him up. On their return to the \"Protector\", the crew discovers that Sarris has seized the ship. After Jason confesses they are just actors, Sarris forces him to explain the truth to the disillusioned Thermian leader, Mathesar. Sarris activates the \"Protector\"'s self-destruct mechanism and returns to his ship.\nJason and Gwen manage to abort the self-destruct sequence by following instructions from Brandon, the leader of a group of \"Galaxy Quest\" superfans back on Earth. Meanwhile, Alexander leads a Thermian revolt against Sarris' forces and takes back control of the \"Protector\". With renewed confidence, the crew challenges Sarris and draws his ship into the magnetic minefield, destroying it. As they return to Earth, Sarris, who escaped his ship's destruction, ambushes them on the bridge and fatally wounds several crew members. Jason activates the \"Omega 13\", which sends everyone 13 seconds back in time and gives Jason and Mathesar a chance to stun and disarm Sarris before the attack.\nThe \"Protector\"'s bridge separates from the main vessel to return the humans to Earth, while the main vessel carries the Thermians into interstellar space. The \"Protector\" bridge crashes into a \"Galaxy Quest\" convention, and the dazed cast emerges to the applause of their fans. Sarris awakens and levels his gun at the cast, but Jason shoots and destroys him. The crowd assumes it was all a display of special effects and cheers wildly, and Jason, with newfound humility, invites his co-stars to share the stage with him while the crew basks in their newfound glory.\nSometime later, \"Galaxy Quest\" is revived as a sequel series, \"Galaxy Quest: The Journey Continues\", with the cast reprising their roles alongside Guy and Laliari as new cast members.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nThe original spec script by David Howard was titled \"Captain Starshine\". Howard stated he got the idea while at an IMAX presentation, where one of the trailers for an upcoming \"Americans in Space\" film was narrated by Leonard Nimoy, a leading actor from \"Star Trek\". The trailer got Howard thinking about how the other \"Star Trek\" actors had become pigeonholed in these roles since the cancellation of \"Star Trek\", and he then came up with the idea of \"What if there were real aliens involved?\" From there, he considered that the rest of his script, \"in a lot of ways, just wrote itself, because it just seemed so self-evident once the idea was there\".\nProducer Mark Johnson, who had a first-look deal with DreamWorks, did not like Howard's script but was fascinated with its concept of space aliens who misconstrue old episodes of a television series as reality. Johnson purchased the script and had Bob Gordon use the concept to create \"Galaxy Quest\". A fan of \"Star Trek\", Gordon was hesitant, believing \"Galaxy Quest\" \"could be a great idea or it could be a terrible idea\" and initially turned it down. Gordon, who did not read \"Captain Starshine\" until after the film was completed, started from the premise of washed-up actors from a sci-fi series involved with real extraterrestrials. Gordon's initial drafts added elements of humor to Howard's script, such as the \"Protector\" scraping the walls of the space dock when Webber pilots the real ship for the first time. The scene with the \"Chompers\" leading into the Omega 13 came from Gordon's viewing of the horror film \"Event Horizon\", which featured a rotating tunnel lined with sharp blades leading into the ship's engine room. Gordon became more confident when he completed the scene where Nesmith confesses to the Thermians, which he felt he nailed. He submitted his first draft to DreamWorks in 1998, and it was immediately green-lit.\nJohnson wanted Dean Parisot to direct. Parisot had directed another film Johnson produced, \"Home Fries\". However, DreamWorks favored Harold Ramis because of his experience and hired him in November 1998. Ramis wanted Alec Baldwin for the lead role, but Baldwin turned it down. Steve Martin and Kevin Kline were also considered, but Kline turned it down for family reasons. Ramis did not agree with the casting of Tim Allen as Jason Nesmith and left the project in February 1999. Parisot took over as director within three weeks. Allen said that the version of the film pitched to him by Ramis and Jeffrey Katzenberg felt more like \"Spaceballs\", and that they wanted an action star to do comedy rather than a comedian to do an action film. Sigourney Weaver, who had worked with Ramis on \"Ghostbusters\", said that he also wanted actors who had not appeared in science-fiction roles before, a choice she thought odd since veterans of the genre would know what was humorous. After seeing the film, Ramis said he was impressed with Allen's performance. Johnson named the main villain after film critic Andrew Sarris, while admitting he also considered \"Haskell\" after Molly Haskell, who was married to Sarris. Once Sarris discovered this, he mocked \"This guy wants to insult me? Oh, boohoo. As long as they spelled my name right, I'm okay.\"\nCasting.\nFollowing Parisot's assignment as director, Allen was quickly cast as Nesmith, and had to choose between \"Galaxy Quest\" and \"Bicentennial Man\". The \"Bicentennial Man\" role went to Robin Williams. Allen said he was a big sci-fi fan and had hoped the role would launch a second part of his career as a sci-fi actor. Some of Allen's sci-fi knowledge was put to use during production: for example, when the crew is about to land on an alien planet, Allen brought up the issue of a breathable atmosphere with Johnson and Parisot; this became dialogue for Fleegman and Kwan in the movie. About his role, Allen said he based his performance more on Yul Brynner's Ramesses II from the 1956 \"The Ten Commandments\", and less on William Shatner as Captain James Kirk from \"Star Trek\".\nAlan Rickman was selected to be Alexander Dane, who played the alien Dr. Lazarus. Rickman had been interested in the part not so much for the sci-fi elements, but because of the humor. He said \"I love comedy almost more than anything. This really is one of the funniest scripts I've read,\" and that \"actors are probably the only professionals who send themselves up. We actually have a sense of humor about ourselves.\" While the original script made Dane a ceremonial knight, Rickman suggested the title would be too much for the character, and this was dropped, though he remained listed as \"Sir Alex Dane\" in the credits. Rickman also provided input into the prosthetic piece that Dane would use to play Lazarus, saying \"it was important for it to be good enough to convince the aliens who believe we're the real thing, but also cheesy enough to imagine that it was something he applied himself\". Rickman's sense of drama came into play during initial reads and script revisions. Rockwell said that Rickman \"was very instrumental in making sure the script hit the dramatic notes, and everything had a strong logic and reason behind it\". The scene where Dane, as Dr. Lazarus, gives a final, powerfully emotional speech to Quellek, played by Patrick Breen, used Rickman's sense of drama, according to Rockwell. Rickman was initially annoyed with Allen's excitement over his role, but eventually the whole cast bonded over the film. Dr. Lazarus' catchphrase, \"By Grabthar's Hammer\", was written as a temp line in Gordon's script; Gordon planned to replace \"Grabthar\" with something less comical, but the line stuck as the production crew started using it around their offices and had it printed on t-shirts.\nWeaver had loved the script since her first read when Ramis was the director, stating \"that great sort of \"Wizard of Oz\" story of these people feeling so incomplete in the beginning, and then during the course of this adventure, they come out almost like the heroes they pretended to be in the first place\". She particularly loved the part of Madison: \"to me she was what a lot of women feel like, including myself, in a Hollywood situation.\" In addition, she had long wanted to work with both Allen and Rickman. Once Parisot replaced Ramis, Weaver lobbied Parisot to cast her, insisting that Madison needed to be blonde and have large breasts to capture the humor of a sci-fi production. She was surprised when she got the role. Weaver said that this role, given some of her personal insecurities, was closer to \"telling the truth about myself and science fiction\" compared to her performance as Ripley in the \"Alien\" films. She wore a blonde wig (which she kept after production) and an enhanced bosom, which many of the crew said gave Weaver a new personality. Weaver often left the set in costume and returned to her hotel to admire herself, saying that she \"loved being a starlet\".\nTony Shalhoub originally auditioned for Guy Fleegman until Sam Rockwell was cast. Shalhoub was cast as Fred Kwan and worked with Parisot to develop the character. Kwan was loosely based on David Carradine, who was a non-Asian in an Asian role in the television series \"Kung Fu\". Additionally, it was rumored that Carradine frequently acted while under the influence of drugs. Although Shalhoub could not overtly portray a \"stoner\" in a PG-13 film, he insisted that Kwan should always be shown eating to subtly reference the stoner stereotype.\nRockwell, who wanted to develop a more serious dramatic acting career, initially considered declining the role after he was cast. He eventually recognized that several successful dramatic actors had done comedy roles early on, and his friend Kevin Spacey persuaded him to take the part. He was the last of the main actors to be cast. Rockwell fashioned Fleegman after cowardly characters from other films, such as John Turturro's Bernie in \"Miller's Crossing\", Bill Paxton's Private Hudson in \"Aliens\", and Michael Keaton's \"Blaze\" in \"Night Shift\". Rockwell drank a lot of coffee before certain scenes to help create the over-excitement and jitters associated with the character. Rockwell's character's name, Guy Fleegman, is a homage to Guy Vardaman, a little-known actor who worked extensively on \"Star Trek\" either as a stand-in or in bit roles. Rockwell and Shalhoub improvised some dialog to contrast Fleegman as an alarmist while Kwan was always nonchalant. Daryl Mitchell had worked with Parisot on \"Home Fries\", and Parisot felt he was the perfect choice to play Webber. David Alan Grier was the second choice.\nJustin Long was cast as Brandon, and it was Long's first feature-film role. Long had just completed a pilot for a television show under casting director Bonnie Zane, who suggested Long to her sister Debra Zane, the casting director for \"Galaxy Quest\". Long said he was nervous auditioning as an unknown actor at the time, competing against Kieran Culkin, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and Tom Everett Scott. Parisot had given Long a copy of \"Trekkies\", a film about the \"Star Trek\" fandom, to help prepare for the character. Long based his character on a combination of Philip Seymour Hoffman's Scotty J. from \"Boogie Nights\" and the Comic Book Guy from \"The Simpsons\". Paul Rudd auditioned for a role.\nOne of the first \"Thermians\" to audition was Enrico Colantoni. Colantoni loved the script and spent time before his audition developing the behavior he thought the Thermians should have. Parisot said that at the end of Colantoni's read, the actor offered a possible voice for the Thermians. Parisot immediately loved the voice and used it to establish the nature of the Thermians for the rest of the casting process. Colantoni led how the Thermians would act, which he called \"happy Jehovah's Witnesses\" taking everything in with \"love and acceptance\". Other actors cast as Thermians included Jed Rees and Rainn Wilson (his feature-film debut). According to Debra Zane, they had \"a difficult time finding an actress to play a Thermian. Ultimately, Zane was so impressed with Missi Pyle's audition that she sent the casting tape directly to Parisot, with a note stating \"If this is not Laliari, I will resign from the CSA.\" Steven Spielberg, also impressed by Pyle, asked for Laliari's role to be expanded, which developed into the romance with Kwan. Jennifer Coolidge was the second choice for the role.\nActors cast as Thermians went to \"alien school\" to learn how to move and talk, since they were \"basically giant calamari hiding in human shape\", according to Parisot. The walk was inspired by how the marionettes were articulated in the series \"Fireball XL5\". Other idiosyncrasies were developed by the actors during this training, and several of their lines came out of improvisations. Wilson's role as Lahnk was to have been larger in the film, but the actor was double-booked for an NBC pilot in New York City. He received a crash course on how to act like a Thermian from Colantoni, Rees, and Pyle, but still was nervous around the A-list actors leading the cast. Wilson said that a deleted scene involving Lahnk, released with the film's home media, was wisely cut given how nervous he was, flubbing his lines several times.\nFilming.\nLinda DeScenna, production designer of the film, was interested in the project because it would not have the same aesthetics as other 1990s science fiction films, and \"it didn't have to be real, hi-tech and vacuformed\". DeScenna drew inspiration for the sets not only from \"Star Trek\", but also from \"Buck Rogers\", \"Battlestar Galactica\", and \"Lost in Space\". DeScenna had hoped to incorporate more essence of the reuse of props and set elements from these shows within the film, but the film didn't provide enough space for this. She used color theming to help distinguish the key elements of the film, with steam blue for the Thermians and the \"Protector\", while Saris and his species were made to be a green tone that stood out against that. The design of the Thermian station was influenced by the works of artist Roger Dean, especially his cover art for the Yes live album \"Yessongs\" (1973).\nThe bulk of the film was shot in studios in Los Angeles. Scenes of the alien planet were filmed at Goblin Valley State Park in Utah. At the time, access to the park was partly by dirt road; fees paid by the production company were used to upgrade the entire access road to asphalt pavement. Other locations used in the film included the Stahl House as Nesmith's home and the Hollywood Palladium for the fan conventions.\nAccording to Weaver, Allen hectored her to sign a piece of the Nostromo, the spaceship from \"Alien\", in which she had starred; she ultimately did, writing \"Stolen by Tim Allen; Love, Sigourney Weaver\", which she claims upset him greatly. During the period of filming, the entire cast attended a 20th-anniversary screening of \"Alien\". After filming wrapped, Weaver kept the wig she wore for the role.\nThe film's visual effects were created by Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) led by Bill George. A challenge in the CGI was making distinctions between scenes that were to be from the 1980s \"Galaxy Quest\" show, which would have been done normally through practical effects, and the more realistic scenes for the contemporary actors. Various practical effects were also used, such as the \"piglizard\" creature that the crew transports onto the \"Protector\".\nPost-production.\nAfter most production was done, Johnson said that DreamWorks was confused by the film, as it was not what they had expected from the script they greenlit, but pushed on post-production as they needed a film to compete with Columbia Pictures' \"Stuart Little\". The film originally received an \"R\" rating, according to Collins and Weaver, before being recut to achieve a family-friendly rating. Shalhoub did not remember any darker version of the film. Gordon had not planned to write a \"family-friendly\" film, and his initial script included mature scenes, such as DeMarco attempting to seduce aliens, and the crash of the escape pod into the convention hall decapitating several attendees.\nWhile \"Galaxy Quest\" was in post-production, Paramount released \"The Rugrats Movie\", which was a box-office success. DreamWorks at that point pushed to have \"Galaxy Quest\" tailored for a younger audience to compete with \"Rugrats\". According to the cast and crew, \"Galaxy Quest\" was re-edited to achieve a \"PG\" rating, requiring scenes to be cut that could have survived if a \"PG-13\" rating had been targeted instead. In the \"chompers\" scene, DeMarco's line \"Well, screw that!\" was dubbed over her original \"Well, fuck that!\" Weaver stated she purposely made her dubbed line stand out as a form of protest from her original line. Several scenes involving Dr. Lazarus were cut, as DreamWorks felt they were too kinky for the desired rating. One cut scene showed Dr. Lazarus' crew quarters on the Protector, which Allen called a \"proctologist's dream and nightmare\". Other scenes were added to provide what DreamWorks felt was necessary continuity for the intended younger audience, such as showing the limo with Nesmith and the aliens \"beaming up\" from Earth.\nIn theaters, the first 20 minutes of the film were presented in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio (minus the opening showing clips from the TV show which were in 1.33:1), before changing to a wider 2.35:1 ratio when Nesmith looks out upon space as the \"Protector\" arrives at Thermia to maximize the effect on viewers. However, this caused some problems with projectionists at movie theaters when showing the film as they had not opened up the screen curtains far enough for the wider aspect ratio. Projectionists had to be told at later showings to prepare for this transition. On the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases, however, after the opening scene showing the TV clips, it goes directly from 1.33:1 to 2.35:1 and remains that way for the rest of the movie. David Newman composed the score.\nPromotion.\nBefore the release, a promotional mockumentary video titled \"Galaxy Quest: 20th Anniversary, The Journey Continues\", aired on E!, presenting the \"Galaxy Quest\" television series as an actual cult series, and the upcoming film as a documentary about the making of the series, presenting it in a similar way to \"Star Trek\"; it featured fake interviews of the series' cast (portrayed by the actors of the actual film), \"Questerians\", and critics.\nWhile these additional materials were made, DreamWorks devoted very little advertising to the film despite its placement near the Christmas season, which the cast and crew felt hurt the potential for the film. Unlike most films where the second and ongoing weekend box office takes decline, \"Galaxy Quest\" saw rising numbers over the first several weekends, and DreamWorks' Jeffrey Katzenberg apologized directly to Parisot for failing to market the film properly. Additionally, the primary trailer used for the film used a cut of the film before all the specific effects were complete, and Johnson felt that if the trailer had used the completed versions, it would have helped draw a larger audience.\nRelation to \"Star Trek\" and other science fiction works.\n\"Galaxy Quest\" is an acknowledged homage to \"Star Trek\"; Parisot said \"Part of the mission for me was to make a great '\"Star Trek\"' episode.\" Gordon's original script was titled \"Galaxy Quest: The Motion Picture\" as a reference to the , and elements such as departing the space dock and the malfunctioning transporters were further nods to the film. The prefix of the \"Protector\"'s registration number NTE-3120 ostensibly alludes to some sort of similar space federation, but in reality stands for \"Not The Enterprise\", according to visual effects co-supervisor Bill George. Parisot refuted claims that the rock monster that Nesmith battled was based on the rock monster that had been scripted for \"\", but instead was more inspired by the Gorn that Kirk faces in the \"Star Trek\" episode \"\". This homage also extended to the original marketing of the movie, including a promotional website intentionally designed to look like a poorly constructed fan website, with \"screen captures\" and poor HTML coding.\nOther aspects of the film were homages to other seminal science fiction works. The Thermians' native planet, Klaatu Nebula, is a reference to the name of the alien visitor in the classic \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" (1951). Quellek's line \"I'm shot\" was influenced by the same line from James Brolin's character in \"Westworld\". The blue creatures on the alien planet were based on similar creatures in \"Barbarella\". The \"chompers\" scene with Nesmith and DeMarco trying to reach the self-destruct abort button was inspired by a scene from the 1997 film \"Event Horizon\" involving whirring blades. The effects for the Omega 13 activation were inspired by the ending scene from \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\".\nIn his review of \"Galaxy Quest\", James Berardinelli states that the movie shares the \"same central conceit\" with a short story by Ruth Berman titled \"Visit to a Weird Planet Revisited\" published in the 1976 anthology \"\" in which William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley are transported to the real while filming an episode of \"Star Trek\" and are pursued by Klingons.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"Intelligent and humorous satire with an excellent cast -- no previous Trekkie knowledge needed to enjoy this one.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 70 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating .\nCritics praised it both as a parody of \"Star Trek\", and as a comedy film of its own. \"The New York Times\"'s Lawrence Van Gelder called it \"an amiable comedy that simultaneously manages to spoof these popular futuristic space adventures and replicate the very elements that have made them so durable\". Roger Ebert, writing for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", praised the ability of the film to spoof the \"illogic of the TV show\". Amy Taubin of \"The Village Voice\" offered a lukewarm review, noting that \"the many eight- to 11-year-olds in the audience seemed completely enthralled\". Joe Leydon of \"Variety\" said that \"Galaxy Quest\" \"remains light and bright as it races along, and never turns nasty or mean-spirited as it satirizes the cliches and cults of \"Star Trek\"\".\nRetrospective reviews for \"Galaxy Quest\" have been positive. \"Esquire\"'s Matt Miller said in 2019 \"the film absolutely holds up as one of the best sci-fi satires ever made\u2014one that challenges our obsession with massive Hollywood franchises, the nature of fandom, and some of the more problematic cliches of the genre. But it does so with a self-aware empathy that makes it an enduring and lasting entry in not only science-fiction, but American film as a whole\". Writer-director David Mamet, in his book \"Bambi vs. Godzilla: On the Nature, Purpose, and Practice of the Movie Business\", included \"Galaxy Quest\" in a list of four \"perfect\" films, along with \"The Godfather\", \"A Place in the Sun\" and \"Dodsworth\". The film has been described by fans and critics as one of the best \"Star Trek\" films, despite not being part of the franchise.\nBox office.\n\"Galaxy Quest\" grossed $71.6million in the United States and Canada, and $19.1million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $90.7million, double the original budget of $45million. It spent its first nine weeks in the Top 10 at the box office.\nImpact and legacy.\nThe film proved popular with \"Star Trek\" fans. At the 2013 Star Trek Convention in Las Vegas, \"Galaxy Quest\" received enough support in a \"Star Trek\" Film Ranking to be included with the twelve \"Star Trek\" films that had been released at the time on the voting ballot. The fans at the convention ranked it the seventh-best \"Star Trek\" film. Tim Allen said he and William Shatner were \"now friends because of this movie\".\n\"Galaxy Quest\" predicted the growth and influence of media fandom in the years after its release. While fandoms such as that for \"Star Trek\" existed at the time of the film, the size and scope presented by the fan conventions in the film had not been seen as much in 1999; since then, major fan conventions such as San Diego Comic-Con have become significant events that draw mainstream attention. The film also depicted fandoms using their numbers to influence production companies to revive cancelled works, such as with \"The Expanse\", \"Veronica Mars\", \"Arrested Development\", and \"Twin Peaks\". The film also captured some negative elements of modern fandom, such as leading actors continuously pestered by fans for intricate details of the work's fiction and other elements of the potentially toxic culture of online fan groups. The novella \"Rabbit Remembered\" (2000) by John Updike mentions the character of Laliari from the film.\nReaction from \"Star Trek\" actors.\nSeveral actors who have had roles on various \"Star Trek\" television series and films have commented on \"Galaxy Quest\" in light of their own experiences with the franchise and its fandom.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; I had originally not wanted to see [\"Galaxy Quest\"] because I heard that it was making fun of \"Star Trek\" and then Jonathan Frakes rang me up and said \"You must not miss this movie! See it on a Saturday night in a full theatre.\" And I did and of course I found it was brilliant. Brilliant. No one laughed louder or longer in the cinema than I did, but the idea that the ship was saved and all of our heroes in that movie were saved simply by the fact that there were fans who did understand the scientific principles on which the ship worked was absolutely wonderful. And it was both funny and also touching in that it paid tribute to the dedication of these fans.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I've had flashbacks of \"Galaxy Quest\" at the many conventions I've gone to since the movie came out. I thought it was an absolute laugh-a-minute.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I loved \"Galaxy Quest\". I thought it was brilliant satire, not only of \"Trek\", but of fandom in general. The only thing I wish they had done was cast me in it, and have me play a freaky fanboy who keeps screaming at the actor who played 'the kid' about how awful it was that there was a kid on the spaceship. Alas.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Yes, I have seen \"Galaxy Quest\" and no, it's not really like that.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I think it's a chillingly realistic documentary. [laughs] The details in it, I recognized every one of them. It is a powerful piece of documentary filmmaking. And I do believe that when we get kidnapped by aliens, it's going to be the genuine, true \"Star Trek\" fans who will save the day... I was rolling in the aisles. And Tim Allen had that Shatner-esque swagger down pat. And I roared when the shirt came off, and Sigourney [Weaver] rolls her eyes and says, \"There goes that shirt again.\"... How often did we hear that on the set? [Laughs]\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I thought it was very funny, and I thought the audience that they portrayed was totally real, but the actors that they were pretending to be were totally unrecognizable. Certainly I don't know what Tim Allen was doing. He seemed to be the head of a group of actors, and for the life of me I was trying to understand who he was imitating. The only one I recognized was the girl playing Nichelle Nichols.\u2014\u200a\nRelated media.\nHome video.\nThe film was released by DreamWorks Home Entertainment on VHS and DVD on May 2, 2000. The DVD version included a 10-minute behind-the-scenes feature, cast and crew biographies and interviews, and deleted scenes. During February 2006, Viacom (now known as Paramount Skydance) acquired the rights to \"Galaxy Quest\" and all other live-action films DreamWorks had released between 1997 and 2005, following its billion-dollar acquisition of the studio's live-action film and television assets. This deal put the film under the same corporate umbrella as the \"Star Trek\" franchise, which has been produced by Paramount Television and Paramount Pictures. A special 10th anniversary deluxe edition was released on both DVD and Blu-ray by Paramount Home Entertainment on May 12, 2009; though they lacked the same features on the original DVD release, they included several new featurettes on the film's history, the cast, and the special effects used in the film's making, alongside the deleted scenes. For the film's 20th anniversary, a \"Never Give Up, Never Surrender Edition\" Blu-ray was released on November 5, 2019, featuring the same features as the 10th edition; a special SteelBook Best Buy exclusive was released on September 17, 2019. For the film's 25th anniversary, a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray edition was released on December 3, 2024, by Paramount Home Entertainment. This edition includes the bonus features from the 10th anniversary deluxe edition, as well as a new interview with director Dean Parisot. This edition is the first home video release to have the original theatrical aspect ratio changes.\nTie-in media.\nIn November 1999, \"Galaxy Quest\" was novelized by science fiction writer Terry Bisson, who stayed very close to the plot of the film.\nIn 2008, IDW Publishing released a comic book sequel to the movie entitled \"Galaxy Quest: Global Warning\". In January 2015, IDW launched a four-issue series set several years after the events of the film called \"Galaxy Quest: The Journey Continues\". In 2021, Eaglemoss Publications released a behind-the-scenes book entitled \"Galaxy Quest: The Inside Story\".\nProposed sequel or television series.\nTalks of a sequel have been going on since the film's release in 1999, but only began gaining traction in 2014 when Allen mentioned that there was a script. Stars Weaver and Rockwell mentioned they were interested in returning. However, Colantoni has said he would prefer for there not to be a sequel, lest it tarnish the characters from the first film. He said, \"to make something up, just because we love those characters, and turn it into a sequel\u2014then it becomes the awful sequel\".\nIn April 2015, Paramount Television, along with the movie's co-writer Gordon, director Parisot, and executive producers Johnson and Bernstein, announced they were looking to develop a television series based on \"Galaxy Quest\". The move was considered in a similar vein as Paramount's revivals of \"Minority Report\" and \"School of Rock\" as television series. In August 2015, it was announced that Amazon Studios would be developing it.\nIn January 2016, after the unexpected death of Alan Rickman from pancreatic cancer, Tim Allen commented in \"The Hollywood Reporter\" about the franchise's chance of a revival:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I'm not supposed to say anything\u2014I'm speaking way out of turn here\u2014but \"Galaxy Quest\" is really close to being resurrected in a very creative way. It's closer than I can tell you but I can't say more than that. The real kicker is that Alan now has to be left out. It's been a big shock on many levels.\nSpeaking to the Nerdist podcast in April 2016, Sam Rockwell revealed that the cast had been about ready to sign on for a follow-up with Amazon, but Rickman's death, together with Allen's television schedule, had proved to be obstacles. He also said he believed Rickman's death meant the project would never happen.\nHowever, the plans were revived in August 2017, with the announcement that Paul Scheer would be writing the series. Speaking to \"/Film\", Scheer said that in his first drafts submitted to Amazon in November 2017 he wanted to create a serialized adventure that starts where the film ends, but leads into the cultural shift in \"Star Trek\" that has occurred since 1999; he said \"I really wanted to capture the difference between the original cast of \"Star Trek\" and the J. J. Abrams cast of \"Star Trek\".\" To that end, Scheer's initial scripts called for two separate cast sets that would come together by the end of the first season of the show, though he did not confirm if this included any of the original film's cast.\nFollowing the dismissal of Amy Powell as president of Paramount Television in July 2018, Scheer said the \"Galaxy Quest\" series had been put on hold while Paramount's management was being re-established, but anticipated the show would continue forward after that. He also said they were making the series to allow the introduction of new characters while extending the setting, similar to what \"\" did for \"A New Hope\".\nAllen stated that a film sequel script is nearly ready to go as of January 2021. The script had been near completion for production by 2016 but with Rickman's death, it would have to undergo major rewrites as the core story focused on the relationship between Nesmith and Dane (Allen and Rickman's characters, respectively). A central plot element was to have the \"Protector\" and its crew affected by time dilation during space flight, which Allen considered a boon for the uncertain production of the film. While Allen said there were no immediate efforts for the sequel's production, he and the other cast and crew keep circulating the idea and believe it would be easy to restart the effort.\nGeorgia Pritchett stated in a June 2021 interview that she and Simon Pegg were working on developing a \"Galaxy Quest\" television series. Paramount was stated to be in the early stages of a \"Galaxy Quest\" series in April 2023 for the Paramount+ streaming service, with production overseen by Johnson.\nDocumentary.\n\"Never Surrender: A Galaxy Quest Documentary\" was produced by the web site Fandom in 2019 to celebrate the film's 20th anniversary.

He was possibly a historical king of the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, who was posthumously deified. His rule probably would have taken place sometime in the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period, c. 2900\u20132350 BC, though he became a major figure in Sumerian legend during the Third Dynasty of Ur (c.\u20092112\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20092004 BC).\nTales of Gilgamesh's legendary exploits are narrated in five surviving Sumerian poems. The earliest of these is likely \"Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld\", in which Gilgamesh comes to the aid of the goddess Inanna and drives away the creatures infesting her \"huluppu\" tree. She gives him two unknown objects, a \"mikku\" and a \"pikku\", which he loses. After Enkidu's death, his shade tells Gilgamesh about the bleak conditions in the Underworld. The poem \"Gilgamesh and Aga\" describes Gilgamesh's revolt against his overlord Aga of Kish. Other Sumerian poems relate Gilgamesh's defeat of the giant Huwawa and the Bull of Heaven, while a fifth, poorly preserved poem relates the account of his death and funeral.\nIn later Babylonian times, these stories were woven into a connected narrative. The standard Akkadian \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" was composed by a scribe named S\u00een-l\u0113qi-unninni, probably during the Middle Babylonian Period (c.\u20091600\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091155 BC), based on much older source material. In the epic, Gilgamesh is a demigod of superhuman strength who befriends the wild man Enkidu. Together, they embark on many journeys, most famously defeating Humbaba (Sumerian: Huwawa) and the Bull of Heaven, who is sent to attack them by Ishtar (Sumerian: Inanna) after Gilgamesh rejects her offer for him to become her consort. After Enkidu dies of a disease sent as punishment from the gods, Gilgamesh becomes afraid of his own death and visits the sage Utnapishtim, the survivor of the Great Flood, hoping to find immortality. Gilgamesh repeatedly fails the trials set before him and returns home to Uruk, realizing that immortality is beyond his reach.\nMost scholars agree that the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" exerted substantial influence on the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\", two epic poems written in ancient Greek during the 8th century BC. The story of Gilgamesh's birth is described in an anecdote in \"On the Nature of Animals\" by the Greek writer Aelian (2nd century AD). Aelian relates that Gilgamesh's grandfather kept his mother under guard to prevent her from becoming pregnant, because an oracle had told him that his grandson would overthrow him. She became pregnant and the guards threw the child off a tower, but an eagle rescued him mid-fall and delivered him safely to an orchard, where the gardener raised him.\nThe \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" was rediscovered in the Library of Ashurbanipal in 1849. After being translated in the early 1870s, it caused widespread controversy due to similarities between portions of it and the Hebrew Bible. Gilgamesh remained mostly obscure until the mid-20th century, but, since the late 20th century, he has become an increasingly prominent figure in modern culture.\nName.\nThe modern form \"Gilgamesh\" is a direct borrowing of the Akkadian \ud808\udc2d\ud808\udd11\ud808\udc86\ud808\ude26, rendered as \"Gilg\u0101me\u0161\". The Assyrian form of the name derived from the earlier Sumerian form \ud808\udc2d\ud808\udd11\ud808\ude4b\ud808\udcb5\ud808\udf8c, \"Bilgames\". It is generally concluded that the name itself translates as \"the (kinsman) is a hero\", though what type of \"kinsman\" was meant is a point of controversy. It is sometimes suggested that the Sumerian form of the name was pronounced \"Pabilgames\", reading the component \"bilga\" as \"pabilga\" (\ud808\ude7a\ud808\ude4b\ud808\udcb5), a related term which described familial relations, but this is not supported by epigraphic or phonological evidence.\nHistorical king.\nMost historians generally agree that Gilgamesh was a historical king of the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, who probably ruled sometime during the early part of the Early Dynastic Period (c. 2900\u20132350 BC). Stephanie Dalley, a scholar of the ancient Near East, states that \"precise dates cannot be given for the lifetime of Gilgamesh, but they are generally agreed to lie between 2800 and 2500 BC\". An inscription, possibly belonging to a contemporary official under Gilgamesh, was discovered in the archaic texts at Ur; his name reads: \"Gilgame\u0161 is the one whom Utu has selected\". Aside from this the Tummal Inscription, a thirty-four-line historiographic text written during the reign of Ishbi-Erra (c.\u20091953\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091920 BC), also mentions him. The inscription credits Gilgamesh with building the walls of Uruk. Lines eleven through fifteen of the inscription read:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGilgamesh is also connected to King Enmebaragesi of Kish, a known historical figure who may have lived near Gilgamesh's lifetime. Furthermore, he is listed as one of the kings of Uruk by the \"Sumerian King List\". Fragments of an epic text found in M\u00ea-Turan (modern Tell Haddad) relate that upon his death Gilgamesh was buried under the river bed, and the workmen of Uruk temporarily diverted the flow of the Euphrates for this purpose.\nAccording to Andrew George, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;it seems likely that there was once a King Bilgame\u0161 in Uruk, just as there may have been in Britain a real King Arthur. But the Gilgame\u0161 of the epic traditions is a literary character, to whom any number of originally disparate traditions have accrued. It is vain to hope to find in history such a hero of legend.\nDeification and legendary exploits.\nSumerian poems.\nIt is certain that, during the later Early Dynastic Period, Gilgamesh was worshiped as a god at various locations across Sumer. In the 21st century BC, King Utu-hengal of Uruk adopted Gilgamesh as his patron deity. The kings of the Third Dynasty of Ur (c.\u20092112\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20092004 BC) were especially fond of Gilgamesh, calling him their \"divine brother\" and \"friend.\" King Shulgi of Ur (2029\u20131982 BC) declared himself the son of Lugalbanda and Ninsun and the brother of Gilgamesh. Over the centuries, there may have been a gradual accretion of stories about Gilgamesh, some possibly derived from the real lives of other historical figures, such as Gudea, the Second Dynasty ruler of Lagash (2144\u20132124 BC). Prayers inscribed on clay tablets address Gilgamesh as a judge of the dead in the Underworld.\n\"Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld\".\nDuring this period, a large number of myths and legends developed surrounding Gilgamesh. Five independent Sumerian poems have been discovered narrating his exploits. Gilgamesh's first appearance in literature is probably in the Sumerian poem \"Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld\". The narrative begins with a \"huluppu\" tree\u2014perhaps, according to the Sumerologist Samuel Noah Kramer, a willow, growing on the banks of the river Euphrates. The goddess Inanna moves the tree to her garden in Uruk with the intention to carve it into a throne once it is fully grown. The tree grows and matures, but the serpent \"who knows no charm,\" the \"Anz\u00fb\"-bird, and \"Lilitu\", a Mesopotamian demon, invade the tree, causing Inanna to cry with sorrow.\nGilgamesh, who in this story is portrayed as Inanna's brother, slays the serpent, causing the \"Anz\u00fb\"-bird and Lilitu to flee. Gilgamesh's companions chop down the tree and carve it into a bed and a throne for Inanna. The goddess responds by fashioning a \"pikku\" and a \"mikku\" (perhaps a drum and drumsticks) as a reward for Gilgamesh's heroism. But Gilgamesh loses the \"pikku\" and \"mikku\" and asks who will retrieve them. His servant Enkidu descends to the Underworld to find them, but he disobeys its strict laws and can never return. In the remaining dialog, Gilgamesh questions the shade of his lost comrade about the Underworld.\nSubsequent poems.\n\"Gilgamesh and Agga\" describes Gilgamesh's successful revolt against his liege lord Agga, king of the city-state of Kish. \"Gilgamesh and Huwawa\" describes how Gilgamesh and his servant Enkidu, with the help of fifty volunteers from Uruk, defeat the monster Huwawa, an ogre appointed as guardian of the Cedar Forest by the ruling god Enlil.\nIn \"Gilgamesh and the Bull of Heaven\", Gilgamesh and Enkidu slay the Bull of Heaven, who has been sent to attack them by the goddess Inanna. The details of this poem differ substantially from the corresponding episode in the later Akkadian \"Epic of Gilgamesh\". In the Sumerian poem, Inanna remains aloof from Gilgamesh, but in the Akkadian epic she asks him to become her consort. Also, while pressing her father An to give her the Bull of Heaven, in Sumerian Inanna threatens a deafening cry that will reach the earth, while in Akkadian she threatens to wake the dead to eat the living.\nA poem known as \"The Death of Gilgamesh\" is poorly preserved, but appears to describe a major state funeral followed by the arrival of the deceased in the Underworld. The poem may have been misinterpreted, and may actually depict the death of Enkidu.\n\"Epic of Gilgamesh\".\nEventually, according to Kramer (1963):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Gilgamesh became the hero par excellence of the ancient world\u2014an adventurous, brave, but tragic figure symbolizing man's vain but endless drive for fame, glory, and immortality.\nBy the Old Babylonian Period (c.\u20091830\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091531 BC), stories of Gilgamesh's legendary exploits had been woven into one or several long epics. The \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", the most complete account of Gilgamesh's adventures, was composed in Akkadian during the Middle Babylonian Period (c. 1600 \u2013 c. 1155 BC) by a scribe named S\u00een-l\u0113qi-unninni. The most complete surviving version of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" is recorded on a set of twelve clay tablets dating to the seventh century BC, found in the Library of Ashurbanipal in the Assyrian capital of Nineveh, with many pieces missing or damaged. Some scholars and translators choose to supplement the missing parts with material from the earlier Sumerian poems or from other versions of the epic found at other sites throughout the Near East.\nIn the epic, Gilgamesh is introduced as \"two thirds divine and one third mortal\". At the beginning of the poem, Gilgamesh is described as a brutal, oppressive ruler. This is usually interpreted to mean either forced labor or sexual exploitation. As punishment for his cruelty, the god Anu creates the wild man Enkidu. After being tamed by a prostitute named Shamhat, Enkidu journeys to Uruk to confront Gilgamesh. In the second tablet, the two men wrestle and though Gilgamesh wins in the end, he is so impressed by his opponent's strength and tenacity that they become close friends. In the earlier Sumerian texts, Enkidu is Gilgamesh's servant, but, in the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", they are companions of equal standing.\nIn tablets III through IV, Gilgamesh and Enkidu travel to the Cedar Forest, which is guarded by Humbaba (the Akkadian name for Huwawa). The heroes cross the seven mountains to the Cedar Forest, where they begin chopping down trees. Confronted by Humbaba, Gilgamesh panics and prays to Shamash (the East Semitic name for Utu), who blows eight winds in Humbaba's eyes, blinding him. Humbaba begs for mercy, but the heroes decapitate him. Tablet VI begins with Gilgamesh returning to Uruk, where Ishtar (the Akkadian name for Inanna) comes to him and demands him as her consort. Gilgamesh rejects her, reproaching her mistreatment of all her former lovers.\nIn revenge, Ishtar goes to her father Anu and demands that he give her the Bull of Heaven, which she sends to attack Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh and Enkidu kill the Bull and offer its heart to Shamash. While Gilgamesh and Enkidu are resting, Ishtar stands up on the walls of Uruk and curses Gilgamesh. Enkidu tears off the Bull's right thigh and throws it in Ishtar's face, saying, \"If I could lay my hands on you, it is this I should do to you, and lash your entrails to your side.\" Ishtar calls together \"the crimped courtesans, prostitutes and harlots\" and orders them to mourn for the Bull of Heaven. Meanwhile, Gilgamesh holds a celebration over the Bull's defeat.\nTablet VII begins with Enkidu recounting a dream in which he saw Anu, Ea, and Shamash declare that either Gilgamesh or Enkidu must die to avenge the Bull of Heaven. They choose Enkidu, who soon grows sick. He has a dream of the Underworld, and then dies. Tablet VIII describes Gilgamesh's inconsolable grief for his friend and the details of Enkidu's funeral. Tablets IX through XI relate how Gilgamesh, driven by grief and fear of his own mortality, travels a great distance and overcomes many obstacles to find the home of Utnapishtim, the sole survivor of the Great Flood, who was rewarded with immortality by the gods.\nThe journey to Utnapishtim involves a series of episodic challenges, which probably originated as major independent adventures, but, in the epic, they are reduced to what Joseph Eddy Fontenrose calls \"fairly harmless incidents\". First, Gilgamesh encounters and slays lions in the mountain pass. Upon reaching the mountain of Mashu, Gilgamesh encounters a scorpion man and his wife; their bodies flash with terrifying radiance, but once Gilgamesh tells them his purpose, they allow him to pass. Gilgamesh wanders through darkness for twelve days before he finally comes into the light. He finds a beautiful garden by the sea in which he meets Siduri, the divine Alewife. At first, she tries to prevent Gilgamesh from entering the garden, and then attempts to persuade him to accept death as inevitable and not journey beyond the waters. When Gilgamesh persists in his quest, she directs him to Urshanabi, the ferryman of the gods, who takes Gilgamesh across the sea to Utnapishtim. When Gilgamesh finally arrives at Utnapishtim's home, Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh that, to become immortal, he must defy sleep. Gilgamesh attempts this, but fails and falls into a seven-day sleep.\nNext, Utnapishtim tells him that, even if he cannot obtain immortality, he can restore his youth with a rejuvenating herb. Gilgamesh takes the plant, but leaves it on the shore while swimming and a snake steals it, explaining why snakes shed their skins. Despondent at this loss, Gilgamesh returns to Uruk, and shows his city to the ferryman Urshanabi. At this point the continuous narrative ends. Tablet XII is an appendix corresponding to the Sumerian poem of \"Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the Netherworld\" describing the loss of the \"pikku\" and \"mikku\".\nNumerous elements reveal a lack of continuity with the earlier portions of the epic. At the beginning of Tablet XII, Enkidu is still alive, despite having previously died in Tablet VII, and Gilgamesh is kind to Ishtar, despite the violent rivalry between them in Tablet VI. Also, while most of the parts of the epic are free adaptations of their respective Sumerian predecessors, Tablet XII is a literal, word-for-word translation of the last part of \"Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld\", and was probably relegated to the end because it did not fit the larger epic narrative. In it, Gilgamesh sees a vision of Enkidu's ghost, who promises to recover the lost items and describes to his friend the abysmal condition of the Underworld.\nIn Mesopotamian art.\nAlthough stories about Gilgamesh were wildly popular throughout ancient Mesopotamia, authentic representations of him in ancient art are uncommon. Popular works often identify depictions of a hero with long hair, containing four or six curls, as representations of Gilgamesh, but this identification is known to be incorrect. A few genuine ancient Mesopotamian representations of Gilgamesh do exist, however. These representations are mostly found on clay plaques and cylinder seals. Generally, it is only possible to identify a figure as Gilgamesh if the work clearly depicts a scene from the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" itself. One set of representations of Gilgamesh is found in scenes of two heroes fighting a demonic giant, clearly Humbaba. Another set is found in scenes showing a similar pair of heroes confronting a giant winged bull, clearly the Bull of Heaven.\nLater influence.\nIn antiquity.\nThe \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" exerted substantial influence on the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\", the Homeric epic poems written in ancient Greek during the eighth century BC. According to classics scholar Barry B. Powell, early Greeks were probably exposed to and influenced by Mesopotamian oral traditions through their extensive connections to the civilizations of the ancient Near East. German classicist Walter Burkert observes that the scene in Tablet VI of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" in which Gilgamesh rejects Ishtar's advances and she complains before her mother Antu, but is mildly rebuked by her father Anu, is directly paralleled in Book V of the \"Iliad\". In this scene, Aphrodite, the Greek analogue of Ishtar, is wounded by the hero Diomedes and flees to Mount Olympus, where she cries to her mother Dione and is mildly rebuked by her father Zeus.\nPowell observes that the opening lines of the \"Odyssey\" seem to echo the opening lines of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", both praising and pitying their heroes. The storyline of the \"Odyssey\" likewise bears many similarities to the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\". Both Gilgamesh and Odysseus encounter a woman who can turn men into animals: Ishtar (for Gilgamesh) and Circe (for Odysseus). Odysseus blinds the giant cyclops Polyphemus, while Gilgamesh slays of Humbaba. Both heroes visit the Underworld and both find themselves unhappy while living in an otherworldly paradise in the company of a seductive sorceress: Siduri (for Gilgamesh) and Calypso (for Odysseus). Finally, both have a missed opportunity for immortality, Gilgamesh when he loses the plant, and Odysseus when he leaves Calypso's island.\nIn the Qumran scroll the \"Book of Giants\" (c. 100 BC) the names of Gilgamesh and Humbaba appear as two of the antediluvian giants, rendered (in consonantal form) as \"glgm\u0161\" and \"\u1e29wbby\u0161\". This same text was later used in the Middle East by the Manichaean sects, and the Arabic form \"Gilgamish\"/\"Jiljamish\" survives as the name of a demon according to the Egyptian cleric Al-Suyuti (c. 1500).\nThe story of Gilgamesh's birth is not recorded in any extant Sumerian or Akkadian text, but a version of it is described in \"De Natura Animalium\" (\"On the Nature of Animals\") 12.21, a commonplace book written in Greek around 200 AD by the Hellenized Roman orator Aelian. According to Aelian, an oracle told King Seuechoros () of the Babylonians that his grandson Gilgamos would overthrow him. To prevent this, Seuechoros kept his only daughter under close guard at the Acropolis of Babylon, but she became pregnant nonetheless. Fearing the king's wrath, the guards hurled the infant off the top of a tall tower. An eagle rescued the boy in mid-flight and set him down in a distant orchard. The caretaker found the boy and raised him, naming him \"Gilgamos\" (). Eventually, Gilgamos returned to Babylon and overthrew his grandfather, proclaiming himself king. This birth narrative is in the same tradition as other Near Eastern birth legends, such as those of Sargon, Moses, and Cyrus. The Syriac writer Theodore Bar Konai (c. AD 600) also mentions a king \"Gligmos\", \"Gmigmos\" or \"Gamigos\" as the last of a line of twelve kings contemporaneous with the patriarchs from Peleg to Abraham.\nModern rediscovery.\nThe Akkadian text of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" was first discovered in 1849 AD by the English archaeologist Austen Henry Layard in the Library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh. Layard was seeking evidence to confirm the historicity of the events described in the Hebrew Bible, i.e. the Christian Old Testament, which was believed to contain the oldest texts in the world. Instead, his and later excavations unearthed much older Mesopotamian texts and showed that many of the stories in the Old Testament may be derived from earlier myths told throughout the ancient Near East. The first translation of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" was produced in the early 1870s by George Smith, a scholar at the British Museum, who published the Flood story from Tablet XI in 1880 under the title \"The Chaldean Account of Genesis\". Gilgamesh's name was originally misread as \"Izdubar\".\nEarly interest in the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" was almost exclusively on account of the flood story from Tablet XI. It attracted enormous public attention and drew widespread scholarly controversy, while the rest of the epic was largely ignored. Most attention towards the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries came from German-speaking countries, where controversy raged over the relationship between \"Babel und Bibel\" (\"Babylon and Bible\").\nIn January 1902, the German Assyriologist Friedrich Delitzsch gave a lecture at the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin before the Kaiser and his wife, in which he argued that the Flood story in the Book of Genesis was directly copied from the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\". Delitzsch's lecture was so controversial that, by September 1903, he had managed to collect thousands of articles and pamphlets criticizing this lecture about the Flood and another about the relationship between the Code of Hammurabi and the biblical Law of Moses. The Kaiser distanced himself from Delitzsch and his radical views and by the fall of 1904, Delitzsch was reduced to giving his third lecture in Cologne and Frankfurt am Main rather than in Berlin. The putative relationship between the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" and the Hebrew Bible later became a major part of Delitzsch's argument in his 1920\u201321 book \"\" (\"The Great Deception\") that the Hebrew Bible was irredeemably \"contaminated\" by Babylonian influence and that only by eliminating the human Old Testament entirely could Christians finally believe in the true, Aryan message of the New Testament.\nEarly modern interpretations.\nThe first modern literary adaptation of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" was \"Ishtar and Izdubar\" (1884) by Leonidas Le Cenci Hamilton, an American lawyer and businessman. Hamilton had rudimentary knowledge of Akkadian, which he had learned from Archibald Sayce's 1872 \"Assyrian Grammar for Comparative Purposes\". Hamilton's book relied heavily on Smith's translation of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", but also made major changes. For instance, Hamilton omitted the famous flood story entirely and instead focused on the romantic relationship between Ishtar and Gilgamesh. \"Ishtar and Izdubar\" expanded the original roughly 3,000 lines of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" to roughly 6,000 lines of rhyming couplets grouped into forty-eight cantos. Hamilton significantly altered most of the characters and introduced entirely new episodes not found in the original epic. Significantly influenced by Edward FitzGerald's \"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\" and Edwin Arnold's \"The Light of Asia\", Hamilton's characters dress more like nineteenth-century Turks than ancient Babylonians. Hamilton also changed the tone of the epic from the \"grim realism\" and \"ironic tragedy\" of the original to a \"cheery optimism\" filled with \"the sweet strains of love and harmony\".\nIn his 1904 book \"Das Alte Testament im Lichte des alten Orients\", the German Assyriologist Alfred Jeremias equated Gilgamesh with the king Nimrod from the Book of Genesis and argued Gilgamesh's strength must come from his hair, like the hero Samson in the Book of Judges, and that he must have performed Twelve Labors like the hero Heracles in Greek mythology. In his 1906 book \"Das Gilgamesch-Epos in der Weltliteratur\", the Orientalist Peter Jensen declared that the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" was the source behind nearly all the stories in the Old Testament, arguing that Moses is \"the Gilgamesh of Exodus who saves the children of Israel from precisely the same situation faced by the inhabitants of Erech at the beginning of the Babylonian epic.\" He then proceeded to argue that Abraham, Isaac, Samson, David, and various other biblical figures are all nothing more than exact copies of Gilgamesh. Finally, he declared that even Jesus is \"nothing but an Israelite Gilgamesh. Nothing but an adjunct to Abraham, Moses, and countless other figures in the saga.\" This ideology became known as Panbabylonianism and was almost immediately rejected by mainstream scholars. The most stalwart critics of Panbabylonianism were those associated with the emerging \"Religionsgeschichtliche Schule\". Hermann Gunkel dismissed most of Jensen's purported parallels between Gilgamesh and biblical figures as mere baseless sensationalism. He concluded that Jensen and other Assyriologists like him had failed to understand the complexities of Old Testament scholarship and had confused scholars with \"conspicuous mistakes and remarkable aberrations\".\nIn English-speaking countries, the prevailing scholarly interpretation during the early twentieth century was one originally proposed by Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet, which held that Gilgamesh is a \"solar hero\", whose actions represent the movements of the sun, and that the twelve tablets of his epic represent the twelve signs of the Babylonian zodiac. The Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, drawing on the theories of James George Frazer and Paul Ehrenreich, interpreted Gilgamesh and Eabani (the earlier misreading for \"Enkidu\") as representing \"man\" and \"crude sensuality\" respectively. He compared them to other brother-figures in world mythology, remarking, \"One is always weaker than the other and dies sooner. In Gilgamesh this ages-old motif of the unequal pair of brothers served to represent the relationship between a man and his libido.\" He also saw Enkidu as representing the placenta, the \"weaker twin\" who dies shortly after birth. Freud's friend and pupil Carl Jung frequently discusses Gilgamesh in his early work \"Symbole der Wandlung\" (1911\u20131912). He, for instance, cites Ishtar's sexual attraction to Gilgamesh as an example of the mother's incestuous desire for her son, Humbaba as an example of an oppressive father-figure whom Gilgamesh must overcome, and Gilgamesh himself as an example of a man who forgets his dependence on the unconscious and is punished by the \"gods\", who represent it.\nModern interpretations and cultural significance.\nIn the years following World War II, Gilgamesh, formerly an obscure figure known only by a few scholars, gradually became increasingly popular with modern audiences. The \"Epic of Gilgamesh\"'s existential themes made it particularly appealing to German authors in the years following the war. In his 1947 existentialist novel , the German novelist Hermann Kasack adapted elements of the epic into a metaphor for the aftermath of the destruction of World War II in Germany, portraying the bombed-out city of Hamburg as resembling the frightening Underworld seen by Enkidu in his dream. In Hans Henny Jahnn's magnum opus \"River Without Shores\" (1949\u20131950), the middle section of the trilogy centers around a composer whose twenty-year-long homoerotic relationship with a friend mirrors that of Gilgamesh with Enkidu and whose masterpiece turns out to be a symphony about Gilgamesh.\n\"The Quest of Gilgamesh\", a 1953 radio play by Douglas Geoffrey Bridson, helped popularize the epic in Britain. In the United States, Charles Olson praised the epic in his poems and essays and Gregory Corso believed that it contained ancient virtues capable of curing what he viewed as modern moral degeneracy. The 1966 postfigurative novel by Guido Bachmann became a classic of German \"queer literature\" and set a decades-long international literary trend of portraying Gilgamesh and Enkidu as homosexual lovers. This trend proved so popular that the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" itself is included in \"The Columbia Anthology of Gay Literature\" (1998) as a major early work of that genre. In the 1970s and 1980s, feminist literary critics analyzed the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" as showing evidence for a transition from the original matriarchy of all humanity to modern patriarchy. As the Green Movement expanded in Europe, Gilgamesh's story began to be seen through an environmentalist lens, with Enkidu's death symbolizing man's separation from nature.\nTheodore Ziolkowski, a scholar of modern literature, states, that \"unlike most other figures from myth, literature, and history, Gilgamesh has established himself as an autonomous entity or simply a name, often independent of the epic context in which he originally became known. (As analogous examples one might think, for instance, of the Minotaur or Frankenstein's monster.)\" The \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" has been translated into many major world languages and has become a staple of American world literature classes. Many contemporary authors and novelists have drawn inspiration from it, including an American avant-garde theater collective called \"The Gilgamesh Group\" and Joan London in her novel \"Gilgamesh\" (2001). \"The Great American Novel\" (1973) by Philip Roth features a character named \"Gil Gamesh\", who is the star pitcher of a fictional 1930s baseball team called the \"Patriot League\".\nStarting in the late twentieth century, the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" began to be read again in Iraq. Saddam Hussein, the former President of Iraq, had a lifelong fascination with Gilgamesh. Saddam's first novel \"Zabibah and the King\" (2000) is an allegory for the Gulf War set in ancient Assyria that blends elements of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" and the \"One Thousand and One Nights\". Like Gilgamesh, the king at the beginning of the novel is a brutal tyrant who misuses his power and oppresses his people, but, through the aid of a commoner woman named Zabibah, he grows into a more just ruler. When the United States tried to pressure Saddam to step down in February 2003, Saddam gave a speech to a group of his generals posing the idea in a positive light by comparing himself to the epic hero.\nScholars like Susan Ackerman and Wayne R. Dynes have noted that the language used to describe Gilgamesh's relationship with Enkidu seems to have homoerotic implications. Ackerman notes that, when Gilgamesh veils Enkidu's body, Enkidu is compared to a \"bride\". Ackerman states, \"that Gilgamesh, according to both versions, will love Enkidu 'like a wife' may further imply sexual intercourse.\"\nIn 2000, a modern statue of Gilgamesh by the Assyrian sculptor Lewis Batros was unveiled at the University of Sydney in Australia.\nThe Australian psychedelic rock band King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard recorded a song titled \"Gilgamesh\" as the fifth track of their October 2023 album \"The Silver Cord\", with references to the epic in the song's lyrics.\nReferences.\nInformational notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The types of grains that contain gluten include all species of wheat (common wheat, durum, spelt, khorasan, emmer, and einkorn), and barley, rye, and some cultivars of oat; moreover, cross hybrids of any of these cereal grains also contain gluten, e.g. triticale. Gluten makes up 75\u201385% of the total protein in bread wheat.\nGlutens, especially Triticeae glutens, have unique viscoelastic and adhesive properties, which give dough its elasticity, helping it rise and keep its shape and often leaving the final product with a chewy texture. These properties, and its relatively low cost, make gluten valuable to both food and non-food industries.\nWheat gluten is composed of mainly two types of proteins: the glutenins and the gliadins, which in turn can be divided into high molecular and low molecular glutenins and \u03b1/\u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03a9 gliadins. Its homologous seed storage proteins, in barley, are referred to as hordeins, in rye, secalins, and in oats, avenins. These protein classes are collectively referred to as \"gluten\". The storage proteins in other grains, such as maize (zeins) and rice (rice protein), are sometimes called gluten, but they do not cause harmful effects in people with celiac disease.\nGluten can trigger adverse, inflammatory, immunological, and autoimmune reactions in some people. The spectrum of gluten related disorders includes celiac disease in 1\u20132% of the general population, non-celiac gluten sensitivity in 0.5\u201313% of the general population, as well as dermatitis herpetiformis, gluten ataxia and other neurological disorders. These disorders are treated by a gluten-free diet.\nUses.\nBread products.\nGluten forms when glutenin molecules cross-link via disulfide bonds to form a submicroscopic network attached to gliadin, which contributes viscosity (thickness) and extensibility to the mix. If this dough is leavened with yeast, fermentation produces carbon dioxide bubbles, which, trapped by the gluten network, cause the dough to rise. Baking coagulates the gluten, which, along with starch, stabilizes the shape of the final product. Gluten content has been implicated as a factor in the staling of bread, possibly because it binds water through hydration.\nThe formation of gluten affects the texture of the baked goods. Gluten's attainable elasticity is proportional to its content of glutenins with low molecular weights, as this portion contains the preponderance of the sulfur atoms responsible for the cross-linking in the gluten network.\nUsing flour with higher gluten content leads to chewier doughs such as those found in pizza and bagels, while using flour with less gluten content yields tender baked goods such as pastry products.\nGenerally, bread flours are high in gluten (hard wheat); pastry flours have a lower gluten content. Kneading promotes the formation of gluten strands and cross-links, creating baked products that are chewier (as opposed to more brittle or crumbly). The \"chewiness\" increases as the dough is kneaded for longer. An increased moisture content in the dough enhances gluten development, and very wet doughs left to rise for a long time require no kneading (see no-knead bread). Shortening inhibits formation of cross-links and is used, along with diminished water and less kneading, when a tender and flaky product, such as a pie crust, is desired.\nThe strength and elasticity of gluten in flour is measured in the baking industry using a farinograph. This gives the baker a measurement of quality for different varieties of flours when developing recipes for various baked goods.\nAdded gluten.\nIn industrial production, a slurry of wheat flour is kneaded vigorously by machinery until the gluten agglomerates into a mass. This mass is collected by centrifugation, then transported through several stages integrated in a continuous process. About 65% of the water in the wet gluten is removed by means of a screw press; the remainder is sprayed through an atomizer nozzle into a drying chamber, where it remains at an elevated temperature for a short time to allow the water to evaporate without denaturing the gluten. The process yields a flour-like powder with a 7% moisture content, which is air cooled and pneumatically transported to a receiving vessel. In the final step, the processed gluten is sifted and milled to produce a uniform product.\nThis flour-like powder, when added to ordinary flour dough, may help improve the dough's ability to increase in volume. The resulting mixture also increases the bread's structural stability and chewiness. Gluten-added dough must be worked vigorously to induce it to rise to its full capacity; an automatic bread machine or food processor may be required for high-gluten kneading. Generally, higher gluten levels are associated with higher overall protein content.\nImitation meats.\nGluten, especially wheat gluten (seitan), is often the basis for imitation meats resembling beef, chicken, duck (see mock duck), fish and pork. When cooked in broth, gluten absorbs some of the surrounding liquid (including the flavor) and becomes firm to the bite. This use of gluten is a popular means of adding supplemental protein to many vegetarian diets. In home or restaurant cooking, wheat gluten is prepared from flour by kneading the flour under water, agglomerating the gluten into an elastic network known as a dough, and then washing out the starch.\nOther consumer products.\nGluten is often present in beer and soy sauce, and can be used as a stabilizing agent in more unexpected food products, such as ice cream and ketchup. Foods of this kind may therefore present problems for a small number of consumers because the hidden gluten constitutes a hazard for people with celiac disease and gluten sensitivities. The protein content of some pet foods may also be enhanced by adding gluten.\nGluten is also used in cosmetics, hair products and other dermatological preparations.\nAnimal feed.\nWheat gluten is used both as a protein source and binding ingredient in pet foods. Wheat gluten imported from China adulterated with melamine used in pet foods was considered to have caused harm in many countries in 2007.\nDisorders.\n\"Gluten-related disorders\" is the umbrella term for all diseases triggered by gluten, which include celiac disease (CD), non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), wheat allergy, gluten ataxia and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH).\nPathophysiological research.\nThe gluten peptides are responsible for triggering gluten-related disorders. In people who have celiac disease, the peptides trigger an immune response that causes injury of the intestines, ranging from inflammation to partial or total destruction of the intestinal villi. To study mechanisms of this damage, laboratory experiments are done \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\". Among the gluten peptides, gliadin has been studied extensively.\n\"In vitro\" and \"in vivo\" studies.\nIn the context of celiac disease, gliadin peptides are classified in basic and clinical research as immunogenic, depending on their mechanism of action:\nAt least 50 epitopes of gluten may produce cytotoxic, immunomodulatory, and gut-permeating activities.\nThe effect of oat peptides (avenins) in celiac people depends on the oat cultivar consumed because of prolamin genes, protein amino acid sequences, and the immunotoxicity of prolamins which vary among oat varieties. In addition, oat products may be cross-contaminated with the other gluten-containing cereals.\nIncidence.\nAs of 2017[ [update]], gluten-related disorders were increasing in frequency in different geographic areas. Some suggested explanations for this increase include the following: the growing westernization of diets, the increasing use of wheat-based foods included in the Mediterranean diet, the progressive replacement of rice by wheat in many countries in Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa, the higher content of gluten in bread and bakery products due to the reduction of dough fermentation time, and the development in recent years of new types of wheat with a higher amount of cytotoxic gluten peptides. However, a 2020 study that grew and analyzed 60 wheat cultivars from between 1891 and 2010 found no changes in albumin/globulin and gluten contents over time. \"Overall, the harvest year had a more significant effect on protein composition than the cultivar. At the protein level, we found no evidence to support an increased immunostimulatory potential of modern winter wheat.\"\nCeliac disease.\nCeliac disease (CD) is a chronic, multiple-organ autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the small intestine caused by the ingestion of wheat, barley, rye, oats, and derivatives, that appears in genetically predisposed people of all ages. CD is not only a gastrointestinal disease, because it may involve several organs and cause an extensive variety of non-gastrointestinal symptoms, and most importantly, it may be apparently asymptomatic. Many asymptomatic people become accustomed to living with a chronic bad health status as if it were normal, but they are able to recognize that they actually had symptoms related to celiac disease after starting a gluten-free diet and improvement occurs. Added difficulties for diagnosis are the fact that serological markers (anti-tissue transglutaminase [TG2]) are not always present and many people may have minor mucosal lesions, without atrophy of the intestinal villi.\nCD affects approximately 1\u20132% of the general population, but most cases remain unrecognized, undiagnosed and untreated, and at risk for serious long-term health complications. People may suffer severe disease symptoms and be subjected to extensive investigations for many years, before a proper diagnosis is achieved. Untreated CD may cause malabsorption, reduced quality of life, iron deficiency, osteoporosis, an increased risk of intestinal lymphomas, and greater mortality. CD is associated with some other autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes mellitus type 1, thyroiditis, gluten ataxia, psoriasis, vitiligo, autoimmune hepatitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and more.\nCD with \"classic symptoms\", which include gastrointestinal manifestations such as chronic diarrhea and abdominal distention, malabsorption, loss of appetite, and impaired growth, is currently the least common presentation form of the disease and affects predominantly small children generally younger than two years of age.\nCD with \"non-classic symptoms\" is the most common clinical type and occurs in older children (over two years old), adolescents, and adults. It is characterized by milder or even absent gastrointestinal symptoms and a wide spectrum of non-intestinal manifestations that can involve any organ of the body, and very frequently may be completely asymptomatic both in children (at least in 43% of the cases) and adults.\nAsymptomatic CD (ACD) is present in the majority of affected patients and is characterized by the absence of classical gluten-intolerance signs, such as diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain. Nevertheless, these individuals very often develop diseases that can be related to gluten intake. Gluten can be degraded into several morphine-like substances, named gluten exorphins. These compounds have proven opioid effects and could mask the deleterious effects of gluten protein on gastrointestinal lining and function.\nNon-celiac gluten sensitivity.\nNon-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is described as a condition of multiple symptoms that improves when switching to a gluten-free diet, after celiac disease and wheat allergy are excluded. Recognized since 2010, it is included among gluten-related disorders. Its pathogenesis is not yet well understood, but the activation of the innate immune system, the direct negative effects of gluten and probably other wheat components, are implicated.\nNCGS is the most common syndrome of gluten intolerance, with a prevalence estimated to be 6-10%. NCGS is becoming a more common diagnosis, but its true prevalence is difficult to determine because many people self-diagnose and start a gluten-free diet, without having previously tested for celiac disease or having the dietary prescription from a physician. People with NCGS and gastrointestinal symptoms remain habitually in a \"no man's land\", without being recognized by the specialists and lacking the adequate medical care and treatment. Most of these people have a long history of health complaints and unsuccessful consultations with numerous physicians, trying to get a diagnosis of celiac disease, but they are only labeled as irritable bowel syndrome. A consistent although undefined number of people eliminate gluten because they identify it as responsible for their symptoms and these improve with the gluten-free diet, so they self-diagnose as NCGS.\nPeople with NCGS may develop gastrointestinal symptoms, which resemble those of irritable bowel syndrome or wheat allergy, or a wide variety of non-gastrointestinal symptoms, such as headache, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, atopic diseases, allergies, neurological diseases, or psychiatric disorders, among others. The results of a 2017 study suggest that NCGS may be a chronic disorder, as is the case with celiac disease.\nBesides gluten, additional components present in wheat, rye, barley, oats, and their derivatives, including other proteins called amylase-trypsin inhibitors (ATIs) and short-chain carbohydrates known as FODMAPs, may cause NCGS symptoms. As of 2019, reviews conclude that although FODMAPs present in wheat and related grains may play a role in non-celiac gluten sensitivity, they only explain certain gastrointestinal symptoms, such as bloating, but not the extra-digestive symptoms that people with non-celiac gluten sensitivity may develop, such as neurological disorders, fibromyalgia, psychological disturbances, and dermatitis. ATIs may cause toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated intestinal inflammation in humans.\nWheat allergy.\nPeople can also experience adverse effects of wheat as result of a wheat allergy. \nAs with most allergies, a wheat allergy causes the immune system to respond abnormally to a component of wheat that it treats as a threatening foreign body. This immune response is often time-limited and does not cause lasting harm to body tissues. Wheat allergy and celiac disease are different disorders. Gastrointestinal symptoms of wheat allergy are similar to those of celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, but there is a different interval between exposure to wheat and onset of symptoms. An allergic reaction to wheat has a fast onset (from minutes to hours) after the consumption of food containing wheat and could include anaphylaxis.\nGluten ataxia.\nGluten ataxia is an autoimmune disease triggered by the ingestion of gluten. With gluten ataxia, damage takes place in the cerebellum, the balance center of the brain that controls coordination and complex movements like walking, speaking and swallowing, with loss of Purkinje cells. People with gluten ataxia usually present gait abnormality or incoordination and tremor of the upper limbs. Gaze-evoked nystagmus and other ocular signs of cerebellar dysfunction are common. Myoclonus, palatal tremor, and opsoclonus-myoclonus may also appear.\nEarly diagnosis and treatment with a gluten-free diet can improve ataxia and prevent its progression. The effectiveness of the treatment depends on the elapsed time from the onset of the ataxia until diagnosis, because the death of neurons in the cerebellum as a result of gluten exposure is irreversible.\nGluten ataxia accounts for 40% of ataxias of unknown origin and 15% of all ataxias. Less than 10% of people with gluten ataxia present any gastrointestinal symptom, yet about 40% have intestinal damage.\nOther neurological disorders.\nIn addition to gluten ataxia, gluten sensitivity can cause a wide spectrum of neurological disorders, which develop with or without the presence of digestive symptoms or intestinal damage. These include peripheral neuropathy, epilepsy, headache, encephalopathy, vascular dementia, and various\nmovement disorders (restless legs syndrome, chorea, parkinsonism, Tourette syndrome, palatal tremor, myoclonus, dystonia, opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome, paroxysms, dyskinesia, myorhythmia, myokymia).\nThe diagnosis of underlying gluten sensitivity is complicated and delayed when there are no digestive symptoms. People who do experience gastrointestinal problems are more likely to receive a correct diagnosis and treatment. A strict gluten-free diet is the first-line treatment, which should be started as soon as possible. It is effective in most of these disorders. When dementia has progressed to an advanced degree, the diet has no beneficial effect. Cortical myoclonus appears to be treatment-resistant on both gluten-free diet and immunosuppression.\nLabeling.\nPeople with gluten-related disorders need to eliminate gluten from their diets to varying degrees, necessitating label laws that enable them to determine suitability of foods. The term \"gluten-free\" is generally used to indicate a supposed harmless level of gluten rather than a complete absence.\nFor persons with celiac disease, consumption of more than 10\u00a0mg of gluten per day will cause intestinal architecture changes in the majority of celiacs. Based on this study by Catassi et al, many jurisdictions opt to use 20 parts per million as the regulatory threshold for a gluten-free claim, which enables someone to consume &gt;500 g of food at &lt;20 parts per million. Those with celiac disease must avoid traces of gluten even if they do not experience overt acute symptoms from cross-contact. The ED05 for a discrete exposure in a wheat allergic person is 6.1\u00a0mg. Because those with wheat allergies may react to proteins other than gluten in wheat, some gluten-free products (e.g. gluten-free wheat starch) may be inappropriate for them.\nThere is no established threshold for those with NCGS, but some double blind feeding studies suggest no effect when 10 grams of gluten is consumed per day. Whether symptoms are alleviated due to gluten elimination or some other component in gluten grains is scientifically debated. Nevertheless, some jurisdictions like the EU and Australia have developed standards such as \"very low gluten\" and \"low gluten\" to accommodate those with NCGS who may be able to tolerate foods with higher levels of gluten in them.\nInternational standards.\nThe \"Codex Alimentarius\" international standards for food labeling has a standard relating to the labeling of products as \"gluten-free\". It only applies to foods that would normally contain gluten.\nAustralia and New Zealand.\nGluten is defined to include wheat, barley, rye, and oats. If gluten is present as an intentional ingredient in a packaged product, these ingredients must be declared in the ingredient list. For a product to bear a gluten-free claim, it must not have any gluten ingredients and must also have no detectable gluten. Beers labelled gluten-free cannot contain barley ingredients irrespective of the level of quantitative gluten. A \"low gluten\" claim may be used where the product has less than 200 parts per million gluten.\nAdjacent label claims like \"gluten friendly\" are not permitted. Precautionary advisory labels such as \"may contain\" and \"made in a facility\" are not permitted on products bearing a gluten-free claim.\nBrazil.\nBy law in Brazil, all food products must display labels clearly indicating whether or not they contain gluten.\nCanada.\nLabels for packaged products sold in Canada must clearly identify the presence of gluten (wheat, barley, rye, oats, triticale) if these are present as an intentional ingredient in the food product. Foods labelled gluten-free must be free of gluten ingredients (wheat, barley, rye) and be below 20 parts per million gluten from cross-contact. Misleading claims such as \"low gluten\" or \"reduced gluten\" are not permitted.\nIn 2015, a market authorization was initiated by the Minister of Health, permitting the inclusion of uncontaminated oats (&lt;20 parts per million) in gluten-free labelled items. Similar to the US law, foods with intentional gluten ingredients such as enzyme treated barley beer may not be labelled gluten-free even if they test below 20 parts per million gluten.\nEuropean Union and United Kingdom.\nAll foods containing gluten as an intentional ingredient must be labelled accordingly as gluten is defined as one of the 14 recognised EU allergens. Foods, including non-packaged foods bearing a gluten-free claim must be below 20 parts per million, irrespective of ingredients. Foods may also be labelled \"very low gluten,\" which is defined as 100 parts per million of gluten or less.\nThe EU/UK permits the use of gluten ingredients in products labelled gluten-free as long as the quantitative level of gluten is below 20 parts per million. The practical effect of this is that products containing fragmented gluten proteins such as soy sauce and barley based beer may be labelled gluten-free assuming they are below 20 parts per million gluten. This aspect of the regulation is controversial as the ELISA immunoassay cannot reliably detect fragments of gluten proteins, whereas there is evidence that those with celiac disease can react to these protein fragments. Other jurisdictions such as Canada and the United States have dealt with this controversy by prohibiting gluten protein fragment ingredients.\nIt is not permissible to label food as \"gluten-free\" when all similar food is naturally gluten-free, such as in the case of milk.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, gluten grains other than wheat do not need to be declared when they are intentional ingredients in a food product. Packaged products bearing a claim of \"gluten-free\", \"no gluten,\" \"free of gluten,\" or \"without gluten,\" cannot have gluten protein ingredients (wheat, barley, rye) and must be below 20 parts per million from cross-contact. Additionally, fermented or hydrolyzed foods (e.g. soy sauce, beer) cannot be labelled gluten-free unless the raw ingredients comply with the gluten-free label rule. In practice, this means that enzyme treated barley beers (as sold in Europe) may not be labelled gluten-free in the United States.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was produced by George Weiss who also made the exploitation film \"Test Tube Babies\" that same year.\nThe film is a docudrama about cross-dressing and transvestism, and is semi-autobiographical in nature. Wood himself was a cross-dresser, and the film is a plea for tolerance. It was widely considered one of the worst films ever made upon release. However, it has since been reevaluated and has become a cult film due to its low-budget production values, idiosyncratic style, and early cinematic themes of transgender acceptance.\nPlot.\nA police inspector investigating the suicide of a transvestite named Patrick/Patricia seeks the advice of Dr. Alton, who narrates for him the story of Glen/Glenda.\nGlen started out by asking to wear his sister's dress for a Halloween party. The narrative explains that Glen is a transvestite, but not a homosexual. He hides his cross-dressing from his fianc\u00e9e, Barbara, fearing that she will reject him. She voices her suspicion that there is another woman in his life, unaware that the woman is his feminine alter ego, Glenda.\nAlton narrates that Glen is torn between the idea of being honest with Barbara before their wedding or waiting until after. Glen confides in a transvestite friend of his, John, whose wife left him after catching him wearing her clothes.\nGlen/Glenda is caught in a storm. The sound of thunder drives him to collapse to the floor. An extended dream sequence begins, containing several vignettes symbolically depicting Glen's struggle with his sexuality. Glen/Glenda wakes and decides to tell Barbara the truth. She initially reacts with distress, but ultimately decides to stay with him. She offers him an angora sweater as a sign of acceptance.\nBack in Dr. Alton's office, he relates another narrative, this one concerning a World War II veteran named Alan who underwent sex reassignment surgery to become \"a lovely young woman\" named Anne.\nProduction.\nShot in four days, the film was loosely inspired by the sex reassignment surgery of Christine Jorgensen, which made national headlines in the U.S. in 1952. George Weiss, a Hollywood producer of low-budget films, commissioned a movie to exploit the case. Originally Weiss made Jorgensen several offers to appear in the film, but these were turned down. Wood convinced Weiss that his own transvestism made him the perfect director despite his modest r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Wood was given the job, but instead made a movie about transvestism. Nonetheless, posters for the film still claimed it was based on Jorgensen's case.\nWood persuaded Lugosi, at the time poor and drug-addicted, to appear in the movie. Lugosi's scenes were shot at the Jack Miles Studios in Los Angeles. He was reportedly paid $5000 for the role, although some stories state the actual amount was only $1000. Lugosi is credited as \"The Scientist\", a character whose purpose is unclear. He acts as a sort of narrator but gives no narration relevant to the plot; that job is reserved for the film's primary narrator, Timothy Farrell.\nThis was the only film Wood directed but did not also produce. Wood played the eponymous character, but under the pseudonym \"Daniel Davis\". His then-girlfriend, Dolores Fuller, played Glen's girlfriend/fianc\u00e9e Barbara. Wood later returned to \"Glen or Glenda\" in his pulp novel \"Killer in Drag\" (1963). The plot features a transvestite called Glen whose alter-ego is called Glenda. He is executed in the sequel \"Death of a Transvestite\" (1967) after a struggle for the right to go to the electric chair dressed as Glenda.\nThe erotic-themed striptease/bondage vignettes were not created by Wood. They were reportedly added by producer George Weiss. He needed extra scenes to add to what he felt was an overly-short film. While not organic parts of the narrative, they seem to tell their own tales of gender dynamics and so fit in with the general themes of the film. The whipping scene suggests a master/slave relationship. The man is dominant and the woman submissive, seeming to reflect male chauvinism. The flirtatious and striptease-themed vignettes were typical of 1950s exploitation films, as was the rape scene. Wood's original director's cut of the film without those added scenes runs 65 minutes, while the producer's cut of film with the added scenes runs 71 minutes.\nThe film has several deleted scenes. In the theatrical trailer, included in laserdisc and DVD editions, the scene in which Fuller hands over her angora sweater is a different take than the one in the release version \u2014 in the trailer, she tosses it to Wood in a huff, while the release version shows her handing it over more acceptingly. There is also a shot of Wood in drag, mouthing the word \"Cut!\"\nThe second part of the film, titled \"Alan or Anne\", is much shorter, told largely through stock footage, and was made to meet the distributor's demand for a sex change film. Alan, whose story is essentially unrelated to that of Glen, is a pseudo-hermaphrodite who fights in World War II wearing women's underwear and undergoes sex reassignment surgery after returning from the war.\nRelease.\nDomestically, the film was limited in release, having been pre-sold to some theaters (under alternative titles such as \"I Led Two Lives\", \"He or She?\" and \"I Changed My Sex\"). Internationally, the film was also limited, and in France and Belgium, the title was translated as \"Louis ou Louise\" and in Argentina as \"Yo Cambi\u00e9 Mi Sexo\" (I changed my sex); the film had a brief screening in the Republic of China. It was re-released to theaters in 1981 by Paramount.\nAccording to Tim Dirks, the film was one of a wave of \"cheap teen movies\" released for the drive-in market. They consisted of \"exploitative, cheap fare created especially for them [teens] in a newly-established teen/drive-in genre.\"\nIt was denied classification by the British Board of Film Classification upon submission on February 26, 1958.\nThe Image DVD release from 2000 was mastered from a censored print and is missing several salacious bits.\nIn 2009, \"Glen or Glenda\" became the final film to be restored and colorized by Legend Films, who subsequently released it on DVD.\nA restored HD print of the film was released in a shortened 60-minute version from Something Weird Video and the American Genre Film Archive in 2020 via the short-lived Alamo Drafthouse on-demand service.\nCritical reception.\nDescribing the film as \"a half-mad old movie Paramount hasn't so much rescued as disinterred\", critic Janet Maslin wrote in a 1981 review of the film in \"The New York Times\" that \"it's dreadful enough to have a certain comic appeal\", that the Lugosi character \"presides over the action like some sex change deity\", that it is \"impassioned [and] incoherent\", but noted that \"there is plenty of inadvertent humor in \"Glen or Glenda,\" with its weirdo homilies, rotten acting and frequent talk of underwear.\" Writing in \"DVD Talk\", critic Ian Jane wrote that \"Wood throws in all manner of strange stock footage of Buffalo and bound women alongside clips of Bela Lugosi freaking out\", that the film is \"so utterly messed up that it borders on arthouse rather than simple b-movie exploitation\", but that it \"holds up immensely for multiple viewings due to its total incoherence\". A review by Andrea LeVasseur in \"AllMovie\" described the film as a \"showcase of Wood's infamous ineptitude\", and noted that \"the personal stories of two transvestites are spoken with ridiculous dialogue, terrible acting, and interspersed with irrelevant stock footage. Every so often, a drug-addicted Bela Lugosi would appear with some strange and pointless narration.\"\nThe critic Leonard Maltin names \"Glen or Glenda\" as \"possibly the worst movie ever made\". Richard Barrios describes \"Glen or Glenda\" as \"one of the funniest and worst movies ever made\".\nLegacy.\nIn 1980, Wood was posthumously given the accolade of 'Worst Director of All Time' at the Golden Turkey Awards, and a revival of interest in his work followed. This led to \"Glen or Glenda\" being reissued in 1982. This cut included six minutes of additional footage. One of the restored scenes features Glen rejecting a pass made to him by a man. At this point, the film was reviewed seriously, and reclaimed as a radical work, by Steve Jenkins in the \"Monthly Film Bulletin\".\nIn his book \"Cult Movies 3\", Danny Peary suggests this is actually a radical, if ineptly made, film that presents a far more personal story than is contained in films by more well-respected auteurs.\nIn 1994, Tim Burton chronicled the troubled production of \"Glen or Glenda\" in \"Ed Wood\". The film includes re-creations of several key scenes, including Lugosi's narration and Glen's plea for his girlfriend's understanding at the end of the film.\nThe characters Glen and Glenda in the film \"Seed of Chucky\", the fifth film in the \"Child's Play\" series, were named after the film.\nDirector David Lynch has named the film as one of his favorites.\nThe mascot of Plan 9 from Bell Labs, the name of which is a reference to one of Wood's other films, \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\", is a bunny named \"Glenda\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The book features many low-budget obscurities and exploitation films such as \"Rat Pfink a Boo Boo\", \"Attack of the 50 Foot Woman\", and the apparently lost \"Him\". Other categories include expensive, big studio failures like \"The Swarm\" and popular films such as \"Jesus Christ Superstar\".\nIn the introduction the authors admit that \"we know our choices will not please everyone\u2014least of all the actors, producers, writers and directors who are honored in the pages that follow. We further recognize that the number of bad films is so enormous and the competition for the very worst is so intense, that all decisions reached here are subject to considerable second-guessing. Nevertheless, we have researched the subject thoroughly\u2014sitting through more than 2,000 wretched films in the last few years\u2014and we believe that our nominees and award winners can stand the test of time.\"\nThe Medveds had previously celebrated bad cinema in the 1978 \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\", many of which were also featured in the various \"Golden Turkey Awards\" categories. Subsequently, they turned their attention to box office bombs in \"The Hollywood Hall of Shame\". They also published a sequel to \"The Golden Turkey Awards\", \"Son of Golden Turkey Awards,\" in 1986. They declared that \"Son of Golden Turkey Awards\" \"is our last word...we hereby solemnly pledge that the years ahead will produce no further Golden Turkey publications by the Medved Brothers...we now pass the torch to whichever brave souls feel ready to take up the challenge.\" \"Son of Golden Turkey Awards\" also listed a \"Who's Who in the World of Bad Movies\" at the end of its awards presentations.\nThe Golden Turkey Awards formed the basis of a 1983 television series \"The Worst of Hollywood\" hosted by Michael Medved.\nAwards given.\nIn the book \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\" the authors invited readers to write in nominating their favorite \"worst films\". More than 3,000 ballots were received. Based on these votes, the Worst Film of All Time award was given to \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" by Ed Wood.\nWood is also awarded the title of Worst Director of All Time, judged by the authors. \nRaquel Welch is judged the Worst Actress of All Time over nominees including Candice Bergen and Mamie van Doren.\nRichard Burton is judged as the Worst Actor of All Time over nominees John Agar, Tony Curtis and Victor Mature. While conceding he is sometimes brilliant, the authors claim Burton's \"occasional triumphs only serve to highlight the pathetic waste in most of his films; for every \"Equus\" in which he appears there are at least a half-dozen \"Cleopatra\"s or \"Boom!\"s. The authors state that \"when he is bad ... well, he's just the pits\" and list several \"bad\" films in which he has appeared: \"The Sandpiper\", \"Hammersmith Is Out\", \"The Voyage\", \"The Medusa Touch\" and \"The Assassination of Trotsky\". Another Burton film, \"\", is the book's first runner up in the Worst Film of All Time award based on reader response.\nList of Golden Turkey winners.\nIn addition, the Golden Turkey Awards had a reader's choice category for Worst Film of All Time, voted upon by readers of \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\".\nHoax film.\nOne of the films nominated in the book was in fact an invention of the authors, and the book's readers were challenged by them to figure out which film was actually fake. The fake film was \"Dog of Norway\" featuring \"Muki the Wonder Hound\". This film was illustrated using a photo of a co-author's pet dog. The giveaway was that the same dog was in the photo of the authors in the back of the book. Another film in the book, the now-lost 1974 porn film \"Him\", has also been cited as the hoax, though it is definitely known to have existed.\nNo formal clarification of the hoax film was provided by the subsequent release, \"The Hollywood Hall of Shame\". That book again features the same dog pictured with the authors (as did the subsequent \"Son of Golden Turkey Awards\"). In \"The Hollywood Hall of Shame\", in reference to the dish barbecued dog, the authors explain that it was \"a snack which produced a mixed reaction among the representatives of an industry that had given the world Lassie, Rin Tin Tin, Benji, Phyllis Diller, and Muki the Wonder Hound.\"\nThe \"Acknowledgements\" page of \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\" ends with:\nAnd love, most of all, to Muki, who was there to understand when the going got rough.\nReception.\nBetsa Marsh wrote for the Gannett News Service, \"In their breezy, irreverent style, bristling with puns and sarcasm, the Medveds take us from one debacle to another...

At times to me, however, the commentary degenerates into smugness or becomes unnecessarily waspish.\"\nIn \"Film Comment\", J. Hoberman was quite hostile, describing \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\" and \"The Golden Turkey Awards\" as \"a pair of humorous non-books researched by teenaged Harry Medved and written by his older brother Michael. The Medved position \u2014 if we discount its patina of \"Mad Magazine\" masochism and resolve to stomach their facetious tone \u2014 also suggests that the best bad movies are akin to masterpieces.\""}
{"id": "13156", "revid": "7852030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13156", "title": "George Fox", "text": "English founder of Quakers (1624\u20131691)\nGeorge Fox, July 1624 O.S. (July\u2013August 1624 N.S.) \u2013 13 January 1691 O.S. (23 January 1692 N.S.), was an English Dissenter, who was a founder of the Religious Society of Friends, commonly known as the Quakers or Friends. The son of a Leicestershire weaver, he lived in times of social upheaval and war. He rebelled against the religious and political authorities by proposing an unusual, uncompromising approach to the Christian faith. He travelled throughout Britain as a dissenting preacher, performed hundreds of healings, and was often persecuted by the disapproving authorities.\nIn 1669, he married Margaret Fell, widow of a wealthy supporter, Thomas Fell; she was a leading Friend. His ministry expanded and he made tours of North America and the Low Countries. He was arrested and jailed numerous times for his beliefs. He spent his final decade working in London to organise the expanding Quaker movement. Despite disdain from some Anglicans and Puritans, he was viewed with respect by the Quaker convert William Penn and the Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell.\nChildhood and youth.\nChildhood.\nFox was born in July 1624 in the village of Drayton-in-the-Clay, now known as Fenny Drayton, in Leicestershire. He was the eldest of six children of Christopher Fox and his wife, Mary, \"n\u00e9e\" Lago. There is no record of either his birthday or his baptism, however the baptismal record of his sisters Mary and Sarah survived. The names of his other siblings, extracted from scattered references in Fox's writings and parish records, were John (later of Polesworth), Dorothy, and Catherine. His father Christopher was a successful weaver, called \"Righteous Christer\" by his neighbours, respected sufficiently to be made churchwarden and part of the relatively financially secure middle class. Christopher would leave his son a significant legacy when he died in the late 1650s which would help to support Fox's travelling ministry for the remainder of his life. He described his mother as \"an upright woman... of the stock of the martyrs,\" likely referring to a family connection to Robert Glover, burned in Coventry in 1555, or Joyce Lewis, burned in Lichfield in 1557 (or perhaps both). These forebears were executed during the Marian Persecutions for their Protestant faith. William Penn would later describe Fox's parents as \"honest and sufficient\" people, and Mary Lago especially as \"a woman accomplished above most of her degree in the place where she lived.\"\nHis birthplace was, and remains, a small rural community, situated about 15 miles (24\u00a0km) south-west of Leicester, 10 miles (16\u00a0km) north of Coventry, and about a mile from Market Bosworth. Located just a few hundred yards off the ancient Roman road of Watling Street, the Leicestershire\u2013Warwickshire and East\u2013West Midlands boundary, once the border between the Danelaw and Anglo-Saxon England, and about eight miles north-west of High Cross, where Watling Street meets the Fosse Way, it lies close to the geographical centre of England. The manor house and the freehold of the village were held by the Purefoy family, Puritans and relatives of the regicide, William Purefoy. No buildings survive in Fenny Drayton from Fox's time with the exception of the parish church of St Michael and All Angels, containing the font in which he and his siblings were baptised and the elaborate tombs of the Purefoy squires. The house where Fox was born and grew up was demolished in the 19th century however its location is marked by a monument erected in 1872.\nFox's birth and upbringing fell during the early Stuart period, towards the end of the comparatively peaceful interval that fell between the English Reformation and the English Civil War. The Reformation had taken the once homogeneously Roman Catholic England to a place of deep religious divisions: firstly between Protestants and Roman Catholic Recusants, and secondly between Anglican Protestants and Puritans, the former content with Elizabeth I\u2019s Calvinist Episcopal reform of the Church of England, the latter thinking it insufficiently radical. The Puritans themselves were subdivided between the Presbyterians (before the Restoration of 1660, mostly members of the Established Church seeking to reform its polity and liturgy) and the dissenters such as the Separatists, the Independents, the Baptists, and the Familists. Finally, within both the High Church Episcopalian party of the Established Church, and among Independents and Baptists, there were further tensions between those with either Calvinist or Arminian views on volition and soteriology. These divisions would proliferate during the Civil War, thanks in large part to Fox's adult ministry. As noted, his own family had been touched by the violence of the Reformation. He was born roughly eight months before the death of James I and the accession of his son, Charles I, whose contempt for the House of Commons, persecution of Puritans and unpopular High Church religious policy would help spark the Civil War.\nIn Fenny Drayton, the patronage (right to appoint clergy) of the parish church was held by the Puritan Purefoy squires. This had developed the parishes staunch Low Church allegiance from Elizabethan times. Anthony Nutter, a notably radical Presbyterian, was rector between 1586 and 1605. The records of the Diocese of Lincoln show that he refused to wear vestments, kneel during services, make the sign of the cross during baptisms, or adhere to any of the vestiges of Roman Catholic ritual in Church of England liturgy. He briefly faced imprisonment in 1590 and was removed from office in 1604 for refusing to conform to James I's religious reforms following the Hampton Court Conference. Despite the relatively uncontroversial approach of his successor Robert Mason, rector from 1606 to his death in 1638 and Fox's childhood catechist, memory of Nutter's radicalism persisted in its influence on Fox's birthplace. Throughout the reigns of James and Charles I, cases of residents being excommunicated for refusing to receive Holy Communion appear in church records, notably Margaret Petty, George Heard, George Orton, George Batling, and George Smith. Smith's last case came as late as 1638, when Fox was 14 during Christopher Fox's tenure as churchwarden. The Puritan radicalism widespread in the village extended to Fox's parents, who, according to his \"Journal\", \"saw beyond the priests\" despite external conformity. Fox was, therefore, born into an atmosphere of pious resistance to church authority.\nReligious formation, education, and character.\nAccording to William Penn, Fox's parents \"endeavoured to bring him up, as they did the rest of their children, in the way and worship of the nation\" - that is to say as a practicing member of the Church of England as by law established and, given the character of Fenny Drayton as a parish, a radical Puritan. There is no record of any formal schooling, but it is clear from his literacy that Fox learned to read and write. It may be concluded that, like most children in the Stuart period, his education and his religious formation were interconnected, focused nearly exclusively on knowledge of the King James Version of the Bible, the Book of Common Prayer, and the Anglican Catechism. His later writings show a thoroughgoing saturation in the King James Version of the Bible, with either direct quotations or clear allusions appearing every few lines in many works.\nFox's \"Journal\" emphasises his serious disposition from an early age: \"a gravity and staidness of mind not usual in children.\" By the end of his childhood this developed into an earnest religious commitment to purity and integrity: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When I came to eleven years of age, I knew pureness and righteousness; for, while I was a child, I was taught how to walk to be kept pure. The Lord taught me to be faithful, in all things, and to act faithfully two ways; viz., inwardly to God, and outwardly to man... to keep to 'yea' and 'nay' in all things \"(Mt. , Jas. )\"; and that my words should be few and savoury, seasoned with grace \"(Col. )\". He reacted with shock and disapproval when he met contrasting behaviour in the adults around him, an attitude arising from the Puritan sensibilities of his upbringing. Modern biographers have described Fox early character as shy, idealistic and judgemental: \"something of a prig\" and \"one who loved men in the aggregate but who strongly disapproved of them as individuals.\"\nEarly adolescence.\nApprenticeship.\nAs he grew up, Fox's relatives \"thought to have made me a priest\" (of the state Church of England) but he was instead apprenticed to a local shoemaker and grazier, George Gee of nearby Mancetter. As William Penn noted after his death, \"he took most delight in sheep, so he was very skilful in them; an employment that very well suited his mind in several respects, both for its innocency and solitude; and was a just figure of his after ministry and service.\" Toward the end of his life he wrote a letter for general circulation pointing out that Abel, Noah, Abraham, Jacob, Moses and David were all keepers of sheep or cattle and so a learned education should not be seen as a necessary qualification for ministry.\nIn his dealings with others during his apprenticeship, he gives the impression of an earnest, reserved, scrupulously honest, kind, and resolute character. Of his honesty and resoluteness he recalls that he was so fond of the Biblically pregnant word \"verily\" that \"it was a common saying among people that knew me, 'if George says 'Verily' there is no altering him.'\" He also recalls times of bullying and mockery from other less sensitive youths, but that \"I never wronged man or woman in all that time\" and that \"people had generally a love to me for my innocency and honesty.\" Throughout his adolescence Fox's longstanding discomfort with the behaviour of his elders deepened - particularly their religious hypocrisy, levity of attitude, excessive consumption of alcohol, and violence in the name of religion. In his \"Journal\" he characterised them as \"professors\" - outwardly practicing members of the established church, or a nonconformist Puritan church, who showed no signs of spiritual and moral conversion. This disillusionment became a spiritual crisis following an incident when he was aged 19.\nAtherstone incident.\nIn the early summer of 1643 Fox reached what William C. Braithwaite called the \"hour of decision,\" after an incident at a fair in Atherstone, a market town about three miles from Fenny Drayton. Fox was sitting and drinking with other young men \u2013 his cousin and their friend, both professing Puritans \u2013 who demanded he pay their bill if he refused to join them in drinking games. Disgusted, he left them, and, after a period of restless despondency and prayer, felt a divine call to forsake friends and family:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; The onset of Fox's great spiritual crisis coincided with the beginning of the English Civil War, which was initially focused heavily on the midland counties where he lived. It had started in August 1642 when Charles I raised his standard at Nottingham, around 50 miles north of Fenny Drayton. Charles had then besieged Coventry later that month, and the first major battle of the conflict had been fought the following October at Edgehill, around 30 miles south. The war would continue until 1646 and briefly break out again in 1648.\nCrisis and early \"openings\".\nBetween 1643 and 1647\u20138, Fox experienced a lengthy spiritual, and likely mental health, crisis. The exact nature of his difficulties is unclear, veiled by terms such as \"condition,\" \"sorrow,\" \"exercises,\" \"great darkness,\" and \"trouble of mind\" as well as conventional sentiments of Calvinist spiritual crisis such as \"tempted to sin\" and \"tempted to despair.\" Subsequent biographers have characterised it as depression brought about by adolescent malaise and the political situation. Fox came to understand it as a providential part of his formation: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I cried to the Lord, saying, 'Why should I be thus, seeing I was never addicted to commit those evils?' And the Lord answered that it was needful I should have a sense of all conditions, how else should I speak to all conditions; and in this I saw the infinite love of God. It was accompanied by what he called \"the command of God\" to embark on a solitary itinerant lifestyle as he sought a solution from various so-called religious authorities: Puritan clergy of both the established Church of England and emerging nonconformist sects. Their failure to \"speak to my condition\" initiated his rejection of almost all outward forms of religion, and a determination to know all religious truth only \"by experiment.\" His discipline of silent prayer gradually brought about a change in his condition, he came to experience what he called \"great openings\", interior religious revelations. This crisis was played out against the backdrop of the First English Civil War (1642\u20131646).\nInitial journeying.\nIn September 1643 Fox \"left my relations, and broke off all familiarity or fellowship with young or old.\" His journey progressed slowly at first, and he spent time living near to Drayton-in-the-Clay, in Lutterworth, the former home and the burial place of the Lollard leader John Wycliffe, and in Northampton. Later he traveled south from Northampton, staying awhile at Newport Pagnell, before arriving at Barnet in June, 1644. He passed through predominantly parliamentarian regions, however both Roundhead and Cavalier troops were stationed in the villages and towns along his route. While at Barnet, Fox was torn by depression (perhaps from the temptations of the resort town near London). He alternately shut himself in his room for days at a time or went out alone into the countryside. He was about 20 years old at this time.\nFirst visit to London.\nThough still afflicted by melancholy, Fox notes in his Journal that he did at length leave Barnet for the City of London in 1644, securing lodgings and renewing acquaintance with his uncle, Pickering, a Baptist minister. Fox's first visit to London coincided closely with serious developments within both the conformist Puritans and the pre-existing nonconformist churches \u2013 perhaps referred to obliquely by his line in the \"Journal\", \"I looked upon the great professors of the city of London\". His own uncles nascent Baptists were still firmly on the radical edge of the Puritan movement and, as he noted, \"still tender\". It was in October 1644 that seven London Baptist congregations issued the First London Baptist Confession. This was itself a response to the official Westminster Assembly of Puritan divines, meeting just up the River Thames, in the Jerusalem Chamber at Westminster Abbey, on the orders of the Long Parliament. This group was responsible for drafting the constitutional documents for a never realised state Presbyterian Church of England - the \"Westminster Confession\" and the \"Directory of Public Worship\", both of which were published in 1644. Fox's depression continued during his time in London, and his increasing disaffection from both mainstream and radical Puritanism is evident in his reaction to the London \"professors\": \"I saw all was dark and under the chain of darkness.\"\nReturn to the Midlands.\nAfter nearly a year of travelling, Fox returned to his family in Drayton, probably in 1645, the year of the decisive Battle of Naseby, his spiritual despondency still unresolved. He returned out of concern for his parents, fearing they were anxious for his safety amid the turmoil of the Civil War. His family urged him to marry, while others advised him to enlist with the Roundheads. Dissatisfied with either prospect, he instead spent several months lodging with a Puritan cleric in Coventry, about 10 miles south of Drayton. He mentions encounters with many \"tender people\" (i.e. those open to true religious experience) and must have witnessed firsthand the impact of the Puritan revolution that was reshaping religious life in most Parliamentarian towns across England. After this, he returned to reside at Drayton. During this time his spiritual despair deepened. The \"Journal\" speaks of deep melancholy, long bouts of solitary nocturnal walking, and a frantic search for advice. The local curate, Nathaniel Stephens, a Calvinist Presbyterian and an academic theologian in the scholastic tradition, at first did his best to minister to Fox with kindness, and they often visited one another. Stephens considered Fox a gifted young man, but the two disagreed on many issues, and he later called Fox mad and spoke against him.\nAfter despairing of Stephens's advice, he sought the counsel of a spate of local clergymen around the Leicestershire\u2013Warwickshire border. The \"ancient\" vicar of Mancetter, Richard Able, told him to take tobacco (which Fox disliked) and sing the psalms (he couldn't sing). Able soon tired of him, grew annoyed, and gossiped to his flock about what he had said. Another clergyman in Tamworth struck him as foolish. A third, Dr Cradock of Coventry, lost his temper when Fox accidentally stepped on a flower bed in his garden. A fourth, John Machin of Atherstone, recommended bloodletting, which, when attempted, drew no blood. As each clerical counsellor disappointed him, Fox's condition grew worse. His Puritan asceticism intensified during this period, and in 1645 he abandoned the celebration of Christmas to devote himself to missions of poverty relief. He also refused to attend wedding celebrations, sending only a present of relief money to poor couples.\nFox's experience of dissenters in this formative period was more mixed than that of the clerics of established church. He expressed admiration for the \u201ctenderness\u201d of many, particularly Baptists and mystics, and horror at others, specifically at Calvinist rigidity, an overemphasis on \u201csin and imperfection\u201d, and at blatant scriptural unorthodoxy, notably from those who denied that women had immortal souls. In spite of occasional sympathies, however, he resolutely refused to join any of the existing dissenting groups.\nInitial \"openings\" and break with the Established Church.\nFox's crisis of confidence came to a head in spring 1646 with his first revelations, or \"openings\" to use his term. They led him to withdraw from all conventional external religious activity (except Scripture reading), thus entering into schism with the Church of England. The step is presented in the Journal as three visions, revelations, realisations, or \"openings\":\nThough central to his later message, these were symptoms of a broader conviction forming around 1646: that religion is not external because God is directly accessible without a mediator. This breakthrough is summarised, retrospectively, a few pages later in the \"Journal\" in one of his best-loved and most quoted passages: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As I had forsaken the priests, so I left the separate preachers also, and those esteemed the most experienced people; for I saw there was none among them all that could speak to my condition. And when all my hopes in them and in all men were gone, so that I had nothing outwardly to help me, nor could tell what to do, then, oh, then, I heard a voice which said, \"There is one, even Christ Jesus, that can speak to thy condition\"; and when I heard it my heart did leap for joy. Then the Lord let me see why there was none upon the earth that could speak to my condition, namely, that I might give Him all the glory; for all are 'concluded under sin, and shut up in unbelief' \"(Rm 11:)\" as I had been, that Jesus Christ might have the preeminence \"(Col )\" who enlightens, and gives grace, and faith, and power. Thus when God doth work, who shall let \"(i. e. prevent)\" it \"(Is 43:)\"? And this I knew experimentally. Both Fox's family and Nathaniel Stephens were alarmed by his refusal to attend church, which followed shortly after, and it occasioned considerable objection from both. In response he cited the First Epistle of John (): \"The anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you.\"\nIt is important to note that Fox's personal crisis of confidence in religious authority coincided with a complete collapse of order in the Church of England. By the execution of William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, in January 1645, the authority of the bishops had effectively disintegrated. Later that year, in October, the Long Parliament passed the \"Ordinance Abolishing Archbishops and Bishops\", formally removing the episcopal structure from the Church. Following Pride's Purge in 1648, the Puritans' longstanding hope for Presbyterian reformation based on the Westminster Assembly's proposals was foiled. By September 1650, Parliament repealed the Act of Uniformity, making Sunday attendance at parish churches optional. This both recognised and encouraged the existing flood of dissenting sects, including the Seekers, an informal movement of individuals and communities who rejected formal worship and sought a more direct religious experience. It is generally accepted that Fox belonged to this group, and that the earliest Quaker meetings were largely formed of former Seekers.\nSolitude and silence.\nFox continued to wrestle seriously with religious questions by himself. He developed an alternative habit of worshiping in solidarity silence, particularly while reading and meditating on Scripture. The \"Journal\" describes this charmingly in the following terms: \"for I would go into the orchard or the fields, with my Bible, by myself... in hollow trees and lonesome places till night came on; and frequently in the night walked about.\" This interior prayer and reflection led to spiritual breakthroughs, but not immediately. A period of ambiguity followed, marked by joyful \u201copenings\u201d and ongoing sorrow: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I kept much as a stranger, seeking heavenly wisdom and getting knowledge from the Lord, and was brought off from outward things to rely on the Lord alone. Though my exercises and troubles were very great, yet were they not so continual but that I had some intermissions, and I was sometimes brought into such an heavenly joy that I thought I had been in Abraham\u2019s bosom \"(Lk 16:)\". As I cannot declare the misery I was in, it was so great and heavy upon me, so neither can I set forth the mercies of God unto me in all my misery.\nReligious Society of Friends.\nIn 1647 Fox began to preach publicly: in market-places, fields, appointed meetings of various kinds or even sometimes in \"steeple-houses\" (churches) after the service. Fox said in his journal \u2018and as I was walking by the steeplehouse side, in the town of Mansfield the Lord said unto me, that which people do trample upon must be thy food. And as the Lord spoke he opened it to me how that people and professors did trample upon the life, even the life of Christ was trampled upon\u2026\u2019 Mansfield in Nottinghamshire was a town to which George Fox lived. The steeplehouse in Mansfield was the church of St Peter and St Paul.\nHis powerful preaching began to attract a small following. It is not clear at what point the Society of Friends was formed, but there was certainly a group of people who often travelled together. At first, they called themselves \"Children of the Light\" or \"Friends of the Truth\", and later simply \"Friends\". Fox seems initially to have had no desire to found a sect, but only to proclaim what he saw as the pure and genuine principles of Christianity in their original simplicity, though he afterward showed great prowess as a religious organiser in the structure he gave to the new society.\nThere were a great many rival Christian denominations holding very diverse opinions in that period; the atmosphere of dispute and confusion gave Fox an opportunity to put forward his own beliefs through his personal sermons. Fox's preaching was grounded in scripture but was mainly effective because of the intense personal experience he was able to project. He was scathing about immorality, deceit and the exacting of tithes and urged his listeners to lead lives without sin, avoiding the Ranter's antinomian view that a believer becomes automatically sinless. By 1651 he had gathered other talented preachers around him and continued to roam the country despite a harsh reception from some listeners, who would whip and beat them to drive them away. As his reputation spread, his words were not welcomed by all. As an uncompromising preacher, he hurled disputation and contradiction to the faces of his opponents. The worship of Friends in the form of silent waiting punctuated by individuals speaking as the Spirit moved them seems to have been well-established by this time, though it is not recorded how this came to be; Richard Bauman asserts that \"speaking was an important feature of the meeting for worship from the earliest days of Quakerism.\"\nImprisonment.\nFox complained to judges about decisions he considered morally wrong, as he did in a letter on the case of a woman due to be executed for theft. He campaigned against paying the tithes intended to fund the established church, which often went into the pockets of absentee landlords or religious colleges distant from the paying parishioners. In his view, as God was everywhere and anyone could preach, the established church was unnecessary and a university qualification irrelevant for a preacher. Conflict with civil authority was inevitable. Fox was imprisoned several times, the first at Nottingham in 1649. At Derby in 1650 he was imprisoned for blasphemy; a judge mocked Fox's exhortation to \"tremble at the word of the Lord\", calling him and his followers \"Quakers\". After he refused to fight against the return of the monarchy (or to take up arms for any reason), his sentence was doubled. The refusal to swear oaths or take up arms came to be much more important in his public statements. Refusal to take oaths meant that Quakers could be prosecuted under laws compelling subjects to pledge allegiance and made testifying in court problematic. In a letter of 1652 (\"That which is set up by the sword\"), he urged Friends not to use \"carnal weapons\" but \"spiritual weapons\", saying, \"let the waves [the power of nations] break over your heads\".\nIn 1652, Fox preached for several hours under a walnut tree at Balby, where his disciple Thomas Aldham was instrumental in setting up the first meeting in the Doncaster area. In the same year Fox felt that God led him to ascend Pendle Hill, where he had a vision of many souls coming to Christ. From there he travelled to Sedbergh, where he had heard a group of Seekers was meeting, and preached to over a thousand people on Firbank Fell, convincing many, including Francis Howgill, to accept that Christ might speak to people directly. At the end of the month he stayed at Swarthmoor Hall, near Ulverston, the home of Thomas Fell, vice-chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and his wife, Margaret. Around that time, the \"ad hoc\" meetings of Friends began to be formalised and a monthly meeting was set up in County Durham. Margaret became a Quaker, and although Thomas did not convert, his familiarity with the Friends proved influential when Fox was arrested for blasphemy in October. Fell was one of three presiding judges, and the charges were dismissed on a technicality.\nFox remained at Swarthmoor until the summer of 1653, then left for Carlisle, where he was arrested again for blasphemy. It was even proposed to put him to death, but Parliament requested his release rather than have \"a young man\u00a0... die for religion\". Further imprisonments came in London in 1654, Launceston in 1656, Lancaster in 1660, Leicester in 1662, Lancaster again and Scarborough in 1664\u20131666 and Worcester in 1673\u20131675. Charges usually included causing a disturbance and travelling without a pass. Quakers fell foul of irregularly enforced laws forbidding unauthorised worship, while actions motivated by belief in social equality \u2013 refusing to use or acknowledge titles, take hats off in court or bow to those who considered themselves socially superior \u2013 were seen as disrespectful. While imprisoned at Launceston, Fox wrote, \"Christ our Lord and master saith 'Swear not at all, but let your communications be yea, yea, and nay, nay, for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.'\u00a0... the Apostle James saith, 'My brethren, above all things swear not, neither by heaven, nor by earth, nor by any other oath. Lest ye fall into condemnation.'\"\nIn prison George Fox continued writing and preaching, feeling that imprisonment brought him into contact with people who needed his help\u2014the jailers as well as his fellow prisoners. In his journal, he told his magistrate, \"God dwells not in temples made with hands.\" He also sought to set an example by his actions there, turning the other cheek when being beaten and refusing to show his captors any dejected feelings.\nEncounters with Cromwell.\nParliamentarians grew suspicious of monarchist plots and fearful that the group travelling with Fox aimed to overthrow the government: by this time his meetings were regularly attracting crowds of over a thousand. In early 1655 he was arrested at Whetstone, Leicestershire and taken to London under armed guard. In March he was brought before the Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell. After affirming that he had no intention of taking up arms, Fox was able to speak to Cromwell for most of the morning about the Friends. He advised him to listen to God's voice and obey it, so that as Fox left, Cromwell \"with tears in his eyes said, 'Come again to my house; for if thou and I were but an hour of a day together, we should be nearer one to the other'; adding that he wished [Fox] no more ill than he did to his own soul.\"\nThis episode was later recalled as an example of \"speaking truth to power\", a preaching technique by which subsequent Quakers hoped to influence the powerful. Although not used until the 20th century, the phrase is related to the ideas of plain speech and simplicity which Fox practised, but motivated by the more worldly goal of eradicating war, injustice and oppression.\nFox petitioned Cromwell over the course of 1656 to alleviate the persecution of Quakers. Later that year, they met for a second time at Whitehall. On a personal level, the meeting went well; despite disagreements between the two men, they had a certain rapport. Fox invited Cromwell to \"lay down his crown at the feet of Jesus\" \u2013 which Cromwell declined to do. Fox met Cromwell again twice in March 1657. Their last meeting was in 1658 at Hampton Court, though they could not speak for long or meet again because of the Protector's worsening illness \u2013 Fox even wrote that \"he looked like a dead man\". Cromwell died in September of that year.\nJames Nayler.\nOne early Quaker convert, the Yorkshireman James Nayler, arose as a prominent preacher in London around 1655. A breach began to form between Fox's and Nayler's followers. As Fox was held prisoner at Launceston, Nayler moved south-westwards towards Launceston intending to meet Fox and heal any rift. On the way he was arrested himself and held at Exeter. After Fox was released from Launceston gaol in 1656, he preached throughout the West Country. Arriving at Exeter late in September, Fox was reunited with Nayler. Nayler and his followers refused to remove their hats while Fox prayed, which Fox took as both a personal slight and a bad example. When Nayler refused to kiss Fox's hand, Fox told Nayler to kiss his foot instead. Nayler was offended and the two parted acrimoniously. Fox wrote that \"there was now a wicked spirit risen amongst Friends\".\nAfter Nayler's own release later the same year he rode into Bristol triumphantly playing the part of Jesus Christ in a re-enactment of Palm Sunday. He was arrested and taken to London, where Parliament defeated a motion to execute him by a vote of 96\u201382. Instead, they ordered that he be pilloried and whipped through both London and Bristol, branded on his forehead with the letter B (for blasphemer), bored through the tongue with a red-hot iron and imprisoned in solitary confinement with hard labour. Nayler was released in 1659, but he was a broken man. On meeting Fox in London, he fell to his knees and begged Fox's forgiveness. Shortly afterward, Nayler was attacked by thieves while travelling home to his family, and died.\nSuffering and growth.\nThe persecutions of these years \u2013 with about a thousand Friends in prison by 1657 \u2013 hardened Fox's opinions of traditional religious and social practices. In his preaching, he often emphasised the Quaker rejection of baptism by water; this was a useful way of highlighting how the focus of Friends on inward transformation differed from what he saw as the superstition of outward ritual. It was also a deliberate provocation of adherents of those practices, so providing opportunities for Fox to argue with them on matters of scripture. The same pattern appeared in his court appearances: when a judge challenged him to remove his hat, Fox replied by asking where in the Bible such an injunction could be found.\nThe Society of Friends became increasingly organised towards the end of the decade. Large meetings were held, including a three-day event in Bedfordshire, the precursor of the present Britain Yearly Meeting system. Fox commissioned two Friends to travel around the country collecting the testimonies of imprisoned Quakers, as evidence of their persecution; this led to the establishment in 1675 of Meeting for Sufferings, which has continued to the present day.\nThe 1650s, when the Friends were at their most confrontational, was one of the most creative periods of their history. Under the Commonwealth, Fox had hoped that the movement would become the major church in England. Disagreements, persecution and increasing social turmoil, however, led Fox to suffer from severe depression, which left him deeply troubled at Reading, Berkshire, for ten weeks in 1658 or 1659. In 1659, he sent parliament his most politically radical pamphlet, \"Fifty nine Particulars laid down for the Regulating things\", but the year was so chaotic that it never considered these; the document was not reprinted until the 21st century.\nThe Restoration.\nWith the restoration of the monarchy, Fox's dreams of establishing the Friends as the dominant religion seemed at an end. He was again accused of conspiracy, this time against Charles II, and fanaticism \u2013 a charge he resented. He was imprisoned in Lancaster for five months, during which he wrote to the king offering advice on governance: Charles should refrain from war and domestic religious persecution, and discourage oath-taking, plays, and maypole games. These last suggestions reveal Fox's Puritan leanings, which continued to influence Quakers for centuries after his death. Once again, Fox was released after demonstrating that he had no military ambitions.\nAt least on one point, Charles listened to Fox. The 700 Quakers who had been imprisoned under Richard Cromwell were released, though the government remained uncertain about the group's links with other, more violent, movements. A revolt by the Fifth Monarchists in January 1661 led to the suppression of that sect and the repression of other Nonconformists, including Quakers. In the aftermath of this attempted coup, Fox and eleven other Quakers issued a broadside proclaiming what became known among Friends in the 20th century as the \"peace testimony\", committing themselves to oppose all outward wars and strife as contrary to the will of God. Not all his followers accepted this commitment; Isaac Penington, for example, dissented for a time, arguing that the state had a duty to protect the innocent from evil, if necessary by using military force. Despite the testimony, persecution against Quakers and other dissenters continued.\nPenington and others such as John Perrot and John Pennyman were uneasy at Fox's increasing power within the movement. Like Nayler before them, they saw no reason why men should remove their hats for prayer, arguing that men and women should be treated as equals, and if, as according to the apostle Paul, women should cover their heads, then so could men. Perrot and Penington lost the argument. Perrot emigrated to the New World, and Fox retained leadership of the movement.\nParliament enacted laws which forbade non-Anglican religious meetings of more than five people, essentially making Quaker meetings illegal. Fox counselled his followers to violate openly laws that attempted to suppress the movement, and many Friends, including women and children, were jailed over the next quarter-century. Meanwhile, Quakers in New England had been banished (and some executed), and Charles was advised by his councillors to issue a mandamus condemning this practice and allowing them to return. Fox was able to meet some of the New England Friends when they came to London, stimulating his interest in the colonies. Fox was unable to travel there immediately: he was imprisoned again in 1664 for his refusal to swear the oath of allegiance, and on his release in 1666 was preoccupied with organizational matters \u2013 he normalised the system of monthly and quarterly meetings throughout the country, and extended it to Ireland.\nVisiting Ireland also gave him a chance to preach against what he saw as the excesses of the Roman Catholic Church, in particular the use of ritual. More recent Quaker commentators have noted points of contact between the denominations: both claim the actual presence of God in their meetings, and both allow the collective opinion of the church to augment Biblical teaching. Fox, however, did not perceive this, brought up as he had been in a wholly Protestant environment hostile to \"Popery\".\nFox married Margaret Fell of Swarthmoor Hall, a lady of high social position and one of his early converts, on 27 October 1669 at a meeting in Bristol. She was ten years his senior and had eight children (all but one of them Quakers) by her first husband, Thomas Fell, who had died in 1658. She was herself very active in the movement, and had campaigned for equality and the acceptance of women as preachers. As there were no priests at Quaker weddings to perform the ceremony, the union took the form of a civil marriage approved by the principals and the witnesses at a meeting. Ten days after the marriage, Margaret returned to Swarthmoor to continue her work there, while George went back to London. Their shared religious work was at the heart of their life together, and they later collaborated on much of the administration the Society required. Shortly after the marriage, Margaret was imprisoned in Lancaster; George remained in the south-east of England, becoming so ill and depressed that for a time he lost his sight.\nTravels in North America and Europe.\nBy 1671 Fox had recovered and Margaret had been released by order of the King. Fox resolved to visit the English settlements in North America and the West Indies, remaining there for two years, possibly to counter any remnants of Perrot's teaching there. After a voyage of seven weeks, during which dolphins were caught and eaten, the party arrived in Barbados on 3 October 1671. From there, Fox sent an epistle to Friends spelling out the role of women's meetings in the Quaker marriage ceremony, a point of controversy when he returned home. One of his proposals suggested that the prospective couple should be interviewed by an all-female meeting prior to the marriage to determine whether there were any financial or other impediments. Though women's meetings had been held in London for the last ten years, this was an innovation in Bristol and the north-west of England, which many there felt went too far.\nFox wrote a letter to the governor and assembly of the island in which he refuted charges that Quakers were stirring up the slaves to revolt and tried to affirm the orthodoxy of Quaker beliefs. After a stay in Jamaica, Fox's first landfall on the North American continent was at Maryland, where he participated in a four-day meeting of local Quakers. He remained there while various of his English companions travelled to the other colonies, because he wished to meet some Native Americans who were interested in Quaker ways\u2014though he relates that they had \"a great dispute\" among themselves about whether to participate in the meeting. Fox was impressed by their general demeanour, which he saw as \"courteous and loving\". He resented the suggestion (from a man in North Carolina) that \"the Light and Spirit of God\u00a0... was not in the Indians\", a proposition which Fox rejected. Fox left no record of encountering slaves on the mainland.\nElsewhere in the colonies, Fox helped to establish organizational systems for the Friends, along the same lines as he had done in Britain. He also preached to many non-Quakers, some but not all of whom were converted.\nAfter extensive travels round the various American colonies, George Fox returned to England in June 1673 confident that his movement was firmly established there. Back in England, however, he found his movement sharply divided among provincial Friends (such as William Rogers, John Wilkinson and John Story) who resisted establishment of women's meetings and the power of those who resided in or near London. With William Penn and Robert Barclay as allies of Fox, the challenge to Fox's leadership was eventually put down. But in the midst of the dispute, Fox was imprisoned again for refusing to swear oaths after being captured at Armscote, Worcestershire. His mother died shortly after hearing of his arrest and Fox's health began to suffer. Margaret Fell petitioned the king for his release, which was granted, but Fox felt too weak to take up his travels immediately. Recuperating at Swarthmoor, he began dictating what would be published after his death as his journal and devoted his time to his written output: letters, both public and private, as well as books and essays. Much of his energy was devoted to the topic of oaths, having become convinced of its importance to Quaker ideas. By refusing to swear, he felt that he could bear witness to the value of truth in everyday life, as well as to God, whom he associated with truth and the inner light.\nFor three months in 1677 and a month in 1684, Fox visited the Friends in the Netherlands, and organised their meetings for discipline. The first trip was the more extensive, taking him into what is now Germany, proceeding along the coast to Friedrichstadt and back again over several days. Meanwhile, Fox was participating in a dispute among Friends in Britain over the role of women in meetings, a struggle which took much of his energy and left him exhausted. Returning to England, he stayed in the south to try to end the dispute. He followed with interest the foundation of the colony of Pennsylvania, where Penn had given him over of land. Persecution continued, with Fox arrested briefly in October 1683. Fox's health was worsening, but he continued his activities \u2013 writing to leaders in Poland, Denmark, Germany and elsewhere about his beliefs and their treatment of Quakers.\nLast years.\nIn the last years of his life, Fox continued to participate in the London Meetings, and still made representations to Parliament about the sufferings of Friends. The new King, James II, pardoned religious dissenters jailed for failure to attend the established church, leading to the release of about 1,500 Friends. Though the Quakers lost influence after the Glorious Revolution, which deposed James II, the Act of Toleration 1689 put an end to the uniformity laws under which Quakers had been persecuted, permitting them to assemble freely.\nTwo days after preaching as usual at the Gracechurch Street Meeting House in London, George Fox died between 9 and 10 p.m. on 13 January 1690 O.S. (23 January 1691 N.S.). He was interred three days later in the Quaker Burying Ground, in the presence of thousands of mourners.\nWorks.\n\"Book of Miracles\".\nGeorge Fox performed hundreds of healings throughout his preaching ministry, the records of which were collected in a notable but now lost book titled \"Book of Miracles\". This book was listed in the catalogue of George Fox's work maintained by the Library of the Society of Friends at Friends House, London. In 1932, Henry Cadbury found a reference to \"Book of Miracles\" in the catalogue, which included the beginning and ending of each account of a miraculous cure. The book was then reconstructed based on this resource and journal accounts. According to Rufus M. Jones, the Book of Miracles \"makes it possible for us to follow George Fox as he went about his seventeenth-century world, not only preaching his fresh messages of life and power, but as a remarkable healer of disease with the undoubted reputation of miracle-worker.\" The \"Book of Miracles\" was deliberately suppressed in favour of printing Fox's \"Journal\" and other writings.\nA sample from \"Book of Miracles\": \"And a young woman her mother\u00a0... had made her well. And another young woman was\u00a0... small pox\u00a0... of God was made well.\"\nJournal.\nFox's journal was first published in 1694, after editing by Thomas Ellwood \u2013 a friend and associate of John Milton \u2013 with a preface by William Penn. Like most similar works of its time the journal was not written contemporaneously to the events it describes, but rather compiled many years later, much of it dictated. Parts of the journal were not in fact by Fox at all, but constructed by its editors from diverse sources and written as if by him. The dissent within the movement and the contributions of others to the development of Quakerism are largely excluded from the narrative. Fox portrays himself as always in the right and always vindicated by God's interventions on his behalf. As a religious autobiography, Rufus Jones compared it to such works as Augustine's \"Confessions\" and John Bunyan's \"Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners\". It is, though, an intensely personal work with little dramatic power that only succeeds in appealing to readers after substantial editing. Historians have used it as a primary source because of its wealth of detail on ordinary life in the 17th century, and the many towns and villages which Fox visited. A notable edition was published in 1852 by Quaker abolitionist Wilson Armistead annotated with historical and biographical footnotes which, according to Armistead, \"must materially increase its interest\".\nEpistles.\nHundreds of Fox's letters \u2013 mostly intended for wide circulation, along with a few private communications \u2013 were also published. Written from the 1650s onwards, with such titles as \"Friends, seek the peace of all men\" or \"To Friends, to know one another in the light\", they give enormous insight into the detail of Fox's beliefs and show his determination to spread them. These writings, in the words of Henry Cadbury, Professor of Divinity at Harvard University and a prominent Quaker, \"contain a few fresh phrases of his own, [but] are generally characterized by an excess of scriptural language and today they seem dull and repetitious\". Others point out that \"Fox's sermons, rich in biblical metaphor and common speech, brought hope in a dark time.\" Fox's aphorisms found an audience beyond the Quakers, with many other church groups using them to illustrate principles of Christianity.\nFox is described by Ellwood as \"graceful in countenance, manly in personage, grave in gesture, courteous in conversation\". Penn says he was \"civil beyond all forms of breeding\". We are told that he was \"plain and powerful in preaching, fervent in prayer\", \"a discerner of other men's spirits, and very much master of his own\", skilful to \"speak a word in due season to the conditions and capacities of most, especially to them that were weary, and wanted soul's rest\"; \"valiant in asserting the truth, bold in defending it, patient in suffering for it, immovable as a rock\".\nLegacy.\nFox had a tremendous influence on the Society of Friends and his beliefs have largely been carried forward. Perhaps his most significant achievement, other than his predominant influence in the early movement, was his leadership in overcoming the twin challenges of government prosecution after the Restoration and internal disputes that threatened its stability during the same period. Not all of his beliefs were welcome to all Quakers: his Puritan-like opposition to the arts and rejection of theological study, forestalled development of these practices among Quakers for some time. The George Fox room at Friends House, London, UK is named after him.\nWalt Whitman, who was raised by parents inspired by Quaker principles, later wrote: \"George Fox stands for something too \u2013 a thought \u2013 the thought that wakes in silent hours \u2013 perhaps the deepest, most eternal thought latent in the human soul. This is the thought of God, merged in the thoughts of moral right and the immortality of identity. Great, great is this thought \u2013 aye, greater than all else.\"\nGeorge is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 13 January.\nA building is named after him at Lancaster University, currently part of Fylde College.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources.\nVarious editions of Fox's journal have been published since the first printing in 1694:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Catesby is suspected by historians to have embarked on the scheme after hopes of greater religious tolerance under James had faded, leaving many English Catholics disappointed. His fellow conspirators were John and Christopher Wright, Robert and Thomas Wintour, Thomas Percy, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keyes, Thomas Bates, John Grant, Ambrose Rookwood, Sir Everard Digby and Francis Tresham. Fawkes, who had 10\u00a0years of military experience fighting in the Spanish Netherlands in the failed suppression of the Dutch Revolt, was given charge of the explosives.\nOn 26 October 1605, an anonymous letter of warning was sent to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, a Catholic member of Parliament, who immediately showed it to the authorities. During a search of the House of Lords on the evening of 4 November, Fawkes was discovered guarding 36\u00a0barrels of gunpowder\u2014enough to reduce the House of Lords to rubble\u2014and arrested. Hearing that the plot had been discovered, most of the conspirators fled from London while trying to enlist support along the way. Several made a last stand against the pursuing Sheriff of Worcestershire and a posse of his men at Holbeche House; in the ensuing gunfight Catesby was one of those shot and killed. At their trial on 27 January 1606, eight of the surviving conspirators, including Fawkes, were convicted and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered.\nSome details of the assassination attempt were allegedly known by the principal Jesuit of England, Henry Garnet. Although Garnet was convicted of high treason and put to death, doubt has been cast on how much he really knew. As the plot's existence was revealed to him through confession, Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the absolute confidentiality of the confessional. Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the discovery of the plot, many important and loyal Catholics remained in high office during the rest of King James I's reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other public events such as the ringing of church bells, which evolved into the British variant of Bonfire Night of today.\nBackground.\nReligion in England.\nBetween 1532 and 1540, King Henry VIII took control of the English Church from Rome, the start of several decades of religious tension in England. English Catholics struggled in a society dominated by the newly separate and increasingly Protestant Church of England. Henry's daughter, Queen Elizabeth I, responded to the growing religious divide by introducing the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, which required anyone appointed to a public or church office to swear allegiance to the monarch as head of the Church and state. The penalties for refusal were severe; fines were imposed for recusancy, and repeat offenders risked imprisonment and execution. Catholicism became marginalised and its adherence shrank to remote areas that were far from London. Despite the threat of torture or execution, priests continued to practise their faith in secret.\nSuccession.\nQueen Elizabeth, unmarried and childless, steadfastly refused to name an heir. Many Catholics believed that her Catholic cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, was the legitimate heir to the English throne, but she was executed for treason in 1587. The English Secretary of State, Robert Cecil, negotiated secretly with Mary's son and successor, King James VI of Scotland. In the months before Elizabeth's death on 24 March 1603, Cecil prepared the way for James to succeed her.\nSome exiled Catholics favoured Philip II of Spain's daughter, Isabella, as Elizabeth's successor. More moderate Catholics looked to James's and Elizabeth's cousin Arbella Stuart, a woman thought to have Catholic sympathies. As Elizabeth's health deteriorated, the government detained those they considered to be the \"principal papists\", and the Privy Council grew so worried that Arbella Stuart was moved closer to London to prevent her from being kidnapped by papists.\nDespite competing claims to the English throne, the transition of power following Elizabeth's death went smoothly. James's succession was announced by a proclamation from Cecil on 24 March, which was generally celebrated. Leading papists, rather than causing trouble as anticipated, reacted to the news by offering their enthusiastic support for the new monarch. Jesuit priests, whose presence in England was punishable by death, also demonstrated their support for James, who was widely believed to embody \"the natural order of things\". James ordered a ceasefire in the conflict with Spain, and even though the two countries were still technically at war, King Philip III sent his envoy, Don Juan de Tassis, to congratulate James on his accession.\nFor decades, the English had lived under a monarch who refused to provide an heir, but James arrived with a family and a clear line of succession. His wife, Anne of Denmark, was the daughter of King Frederick II of Denmark. Their eldest child, the nine-year-old Henry, was considered a handsome and confident boy, and their two younger children, Elizabeth and Charles, were proof that James was able to provide heirs to continue the Protestant monarchy.\nEarly reign of James I.\nJames's attitude towards Catholics was more moderate than that of his predecessor, perhaps even tolerant. He swore that he would not \"persecute any that will be quiet and give an outward obedience to the law\", and believed that exile was a better solution than capital punishment: \"I would be glad to have both their heads and their bodies separated from this whole island and transported beyond seas.\" Some Catholics believed that the martyrdom of James's mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, would encourage James to convert to the Catholic faith, and the Catholic houses of Europe may also have shared that hope.\nJames received an envoy from Albert VII, ruler of the remaining Catholic territories in the Netherlands after over 30 years of war in the Dutch Revolt by English-supported Protestant rebels. For the Catholic expatriates engaged in that struggle, the restoration by force of a Catholic monarchy was an intriguing possibility, but following the failed Spanish invasion of England in 1588 the papacy had taken a longer-term view on the return of a Catholic monarch to the English throne.\nDuring James I's reign the European wars of religion were intensifying. Protestants and Catholics were engaged in violent persecution of each other across Europe following the Protestant Reformation. Catholics made several assassination attempts on Protestant rulers in Europe and in England, including plans to poison James I's predecessor, Elizabeth I. In 1589, during the French Wars of Religion, the French King Henry III was mortally wounded with a dagger by Jacques Cl\u00e9ment, a fanatic member of the Catholic League of France. Nine years later, the Jesuit Juan de Mariana's 1599 \"On Kings and the Education of Kings\" (\"De rege et regis institutione\") argued in support of tyrannicide. This work recounted the assassination of Henry III and argued for the legal right to overthrow a tyrant. Perhaps due in part to the publication of \"De rege\", until the 1620s, some English Catholics believed that regicide was justifiable to remove 'tyrants' from power. Much of the \"rather nervous\" political writing from James I was \"concerned with the threat of Catholic assassination and refutation of the [Catholic] argument that 'faith did not need to be kept with heretics'\".\nEarly plots.\nIn the absence of any sign that James would move to end the persecution of Catholics, as some had hoped for, several members of the clergy (including two anti-Jesuit priests) decided to take matters into their own hands. In what became known as the Bye Plot, the priests William Watson and William Clark planned to kidnap James and hold him in the Tower of London until he agreed to be more tolerant towards Catholics. Cecil received news of the plot from several sources, including the Archpriest George Blackwell, who instructed his priests to have no part in any such schemes. At about the same time, Lord Cobham, Lord Grey de Wilton, Griffin Markham and Walter Raleigh hatched what became known as the Main Plot, which involved removing James and his family and supplanting them with Arbella Stuart, James' first cousin. Amongst others, they approached Philip III of Spain for funding, but were unsuccessful. All those involved in both plots were arrested in July and tried in autumn 1603. George Brooke was executed, but James\u2014keen not to have too bloody a start to his reign\u2014reprieved Cobham, Grey, and Markham while they were at the scaffold. Raleigh, who had watched while his colleagues sweated, had been due to be executed a few days later, but was also pardoned. Arbella Stuart denied any knowledge of the Main Plot. However, the two priests, Watson and Clark\u2014condemned and \"very bloodily handled\"\u2014were executed.\nThe Catholic community responded to news of these plots with shock. The Bye Plot revealed by Catholics was instrumental in saving them from further persecution, and James was grateful enough to allow pardons for those recusants who sued for them, as well as postponing payment of their fines for a year.\nOn 19 February 1604, shortly after he discovered that his wife, Queen Anne, had been sent a rosary from Pope Clement VIII via one of James's spies, Sir Anthony Standen, James denounced the Catholic Church. Three days later, he ordered all Jesuits and all other Catholic priests to leave the country, and reimposed the collection of fines for recusancy.\nJames changed his focus from the anxieties of English Catholics to the establishment of an Anglo-Scottish union. He also appointed Scottish nobles such as George Home to his court, which proved unpopular with the Parliament of England. Some Members of Parliament made it clear that, in their view, the \"effluxion of people from the Northern parts\" was unwelcome, and compared them to \"plants which are transported from barren ground into a more fertile one\". Even more discontent resulted when the King allowed his Scottish nobles to collect the recusancy fines. There were 5,560\u00a0convicted of recusancy in 1605, of whom 112\u00a0were landowners. The very few Catholics of great wealth who refused to attend services at their parish church were fined \u00a320 per month. Those of more moderate means had to pay two-thirds of their annual rental income; middle class recusants were fined one shilling a week, although the collection of all these fines was \"haphazard and negligent\". When James came to power, almost \u00a35,000 a year (equivalent to almost \u00a312 million in 2020) was being raised by these fines.\nOn 19 March, the King gave his opening speech to his first English Parliament in which he spoke of his desire to secure peace, but only by \"profession of the true religion\". He also spoke of a Christian union and reiterated his desire to avoid religious persecution. For the Catholics, the King's speech made it clear that they were not to \"increase their number and strength in this Kingdom\", that \"they might be in hope to erect their Religion again\". To John Gerard, these words were almost certainly responsible for the heightened levels of persecution the members of his faith now suffered, and for the priest Oswald Tesimond, they were a repudiation of the early claims that the King had made, upon which the papists had built their hopes. A week after James's speech, Edmund, Lord Sheffield, informed the king of over 900\u00a0recusants brought before the Assizes in Normanby, and on 24 April, the Popish Recusants Act 1605 was introduced in Parliament which threatened to outlaw all English followers of the Catholic Church.\nPlot.\nThe conspirators' principal aim was to kill King James, but many other important targets would also be present at the State Opening of Parliament, including the monarch's nearest relatives and members of the Privy Council. The senior judges of the English legal system, most of the Protestant aristocracy, and the bishops of the Church of England would all have attended in their capacity as members of the House of Lords, along with the members of the House of Commons. Another important objective was the kidnapping of the King's daughter, Elizabeth. Housed at Coombe Abbey near Coventry, she lived only ten miles north of Warwick\u2014convenient for the plotters, most of whom lived in the Midlands. Once the King and his Parliament were dead, the plotters intended to install Elizabeth on the English throne as a titular queen. The fate of her brothers, Henry and Charles, would be improvised; their role in state ceremonies was, as yet, uncertain. The plotters planned to use Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, as Elizabeth's regent, but most likely never informed him of this.\nInitial recruitment.\nRobert Catesby, a man of \"ancient, historic and distinguished lineage\", was the inspiration behind the plot. He was described by contemporaries as \"a good-looking man, about six feet tall, athletic and a good swordsman\". Along with several other conspirators, he took part in the Essex Rebellion in 1601 during which he was wounded and captured. Queen Elizabeth allowed him to escape with his life after fining him 4,000\u00a0marks (equivalent to more than \u00a36\u00a0million in 2008), after which he sold his estate in Chastleton.\nIn 1603 Catesby helped to organise a mission to the new king of Spain, Philip III, urging Philip to launch an invasion attempt on England, which they assured him would be well supported, particularly by the English Catholics. Thomas Wintour was chosen as the emissary, but the Spanish king, although sympathetic to the plight of Catholics in England, was intent on making peace with James. Wintour had also attempted to convince the Spanish envoy Don Juan de Tassis that \"3,000 Catholics\" were ready and waiting to support such an invasion. Concern was voiced by Pope Clement VIII that using violence to achieve a restoration of Catholic power in England would result in the destruction of those that remained.\nAccording to contemporary accounts, in February 1604, Catesby invited Thomas Wintour to his house in Lambeth, where they discussed Catesby's plan to re-establish Catholicism in England by blowing up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament. Wintour was known as a competent scholar, able to speak several languages, and he had fought with the English army in the Netherlands. His uncle, Francis Ingleby, had been executed for being a Catholic priest in 1586, and Wintour later converted to Catholicism. Also present at the meeting was John Wright, a devout Catholic said to be one of the best swordsmen of his day, and a man who had taken part with Catesby in the Earl of Essex's rebellion three years earlier. Despite his reservations over the possible repercussions should the attempt fail, Wintour agreed to join the conspiracy, perhaps persuaded by Catesby's rhetoric: \"Let us give the attempt and where it faileth, pass no further.\"\nWintour travelled to Flanders to enquire about Spanish support. While there, he sought out Guy Fawkes, a committed Catholic who had served as a soldier in the Southern Netherlands under the command of William Stanley, and in 1603 had been recommended for a captaincy. Accompanied by John Wright's brother Christopher, Fawkes had also been a member of the 1603 delegation to the Spanish court pleading for an invasion of England. Wintour told Fawkes that \", and that certain gentlemen \". The two men returned to England late in April 1604, telling Catesby that Spanish support was unlikely. Thomas Percy, Catesby's friend and John Wright's brother-in-law, was introduced to the plot several weeks later.\nPercy had found employment with his kinsman the Earl of Northumberland, and by 1596, was his agent for the family's northern estates. About 1600\u20131601 he served with his patron in the Low Countries. At some point during Northumberland's command in the Low Countries, Percy became his agent in his communications with James I. Percy was reputedly a \"serious\" character who had converted to the Catholic faith. His early years were, according to a Catholic source, marked by a tendency to rely on \"his sword and personal courage\". Northumberland, although not a Catholic himself, planned to build a strong relationship with James I in order to better the prospects of English Catholics, and to reduce the family disgrace caused by his cousin's separation from his wife Martha Wright, a favourite of Elizabeth I.\nThomas Percy's meetings with James seemed to go well. Percy returned with promises of support for the Catholics, and Northumberland believed that James would go so far as to allow Mass in private houses, so as not to cause public offence. Percy, keen to improve his standing, went even further, claiming that the future king would guarantee the safety of English Catholics.\nInitial planning.\nThe first meeting between the five conspirators took place on 20 May 1604, probably at the Duck and Drake Inn, just off the Strand, Thomas Wintour's usual residence when staying in London. Catesby, Thomas Wintour, and John Wright were in attendance, joined by Guy Fawkes and Thomas Percy. Alone in a private room, the five plotters swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book. By coincidence, and ignorant of the plot, John Gerard (a friend of Catesby's) was celebrating Mass in another room, and the five men subsequently received the Eucharist.\nFurther recruitment.\nThe adjournment of Parliament gave the conspirators, they thought, until February 1605 to finalise their plans. On 9 June 1604, Percy's patron, the Earl of Northumberland, appointed him to the Band of Gentlemen Pensioners, a mounted troop of 50\u00a0bodyguards to the King. This role gave Percy reason to seek a base in London, and a small property near the Prince's Chamber owned by Henry Ferrers, a tenant of John Whynniard, was chosen. Percy arranged for the use of the house through Northumberland's agents, Dudley Carleton and John Hippisley. Fawkes, using the pseudonym \"John Johnson\", took charge of the building, posing as Percy's servant.\nThe building was occupied by Scottish commissioners appointed by the King to consider his plans for the unification of England and Scotland, so the plotters hired Catesby's lodgings in Lambeth, on the opposite bank of the Thames, from where their stored gunpowder and other supplies could be conveniently rowed across each night. Meanwhile, King James I continued with his policies against the Catholics, and Parliament pushed through anti-Catholic legislation, until its adjournment on 7 July.\nFollowing their oath, the plotters left London and returned to their homes. \nThe conspirators returned to London in October 1604, when Robert Keyes, a \"desperate man, ruined and indebted\", was admitted to the group. His responsibility was to take charge of Catesby's house in Lambeth, where the gunpowder and other supplies were to be stored. Keyes's family had notable connections; his wife's employer was the Catholic Lord Mordaunt. He was tall, with a red beard, and was seen as trustworthy and\u2014like Fawkes\u2014capable of looking after himself. In December Catesby recruited his servant, Thomas Bates, into the plot, after the latter accidentally became aware of it.\nIt was announced on 24 December 1604 that the scheduled February re-opening of Parliament would be delayed. Concern over the plague meant that rather than sitting in February, as the plotters had originally planned for, Parliament would not sit again until 3 October 1605. The contemporaneous account of the prosecution claimed that during this delay the conspirators were digging a tunnel beneath Parliament. This may have been a government fabrication, as no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found. The account of a tunnel comes directly from Thomas Wintour's confession, and Guy Fawkes did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation. Logistically, digging a tunnel would have proved extremely difficult, especially as none of the conspirators had any experience of mining. If the story is true, by 6 December 1604 the Scottish commissioners had finished their work, and the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords. They ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they heard a noise from above. The noise turned out to be the then-tenant's widow, who was clearing out the undercroft directly beneath the House of Lords\u2014the room where the plotters eventually stored the gunpowder.\nBy the time the plotters reconvened at the start of the old style new year on Lady Day, 25 March 1605, three more had been admitted to their ranks; Robert Wintour, John Grant, and Christopher Wright. The additions of Wintour and Wright were obvious choices. Along with a small fortune, Robert Wintour inherited Huddington Court (a known refuge for priests) near Worcester, and was reputedly a generous and well-liked man. A devout Catholic, he married Gertrude, the daughter of John Talbot of Grafton, from a prominent Worcestershire family of recusants. Christopher Wright, John's brother, had also taken part in the Earl of Essex's revolt and had moved his family to Twigmore in Lincolnshire, then known as something of a haven for priests. John Grant was married to Wintour's sister, Dorothy, and was lord of the manor of Norbrook near Stratford-upon-Avon. Reputed to be an intelligent, thoughtful man, he sheltered Catholics at his home at Snitterfield, and was another who had been involved in the Essex revolt of 1601.\nUndercroft.\nIn addition, 25 March was the day on which the plotters purchased the lease to the undercroft they had supposedly tunnelled near to, owned by John Whynniard. The Palace of Westminster in the early 17th century was a warren of buildings clustered around the medieval chambers, chapels, and halls of the former royal palace that housed both Parliament and the various royal law courts. The old palace was easily accessible; merchants, lawyers, and others lived and worked in the lodgings, shops and taverns within its precincts. Whynniard's building was along a right-angle to the House of Lords, alongside a passageway called Parliament Place, which itself led to Parliament Stairs and the River Thames. Undercrofts were common features at the time, used to house a variety of materials including food and firewood. Whynniard's undercroft, on the ground floor, was directly beneath the first-floor House of Lords, and may once have been part of the palace's medieval kitchen. Unused and filthy, its location was ideal for what the group planned to do.\nIn the second week of June, Catesby met in London the principal Jesuit in England, Henry Garnet, and asked him about the morality of entering into an undertaking which might involve the destruction of the innocent, together with the guilty. Garnet answered that such actions could often be excused, but according to his own account later admonished Catesby during a second meeting in July in Essex, showing him a letter from the pope which forbade rebellion. Soon after, the Jesuit priest Oswald Tesimond told Garnet he had taken Catesby's confession, in the course of which he had learnt of the plot. Garnet and Catesby met for a third time on 24 July 1605, at the house of the wealthy Catholic Anne Vaux in Enfield Chase. Garnet decided that Tesimond's account had been given under the seal of the confessional, and that canon law therefore forbade him to repeat what he had heard. Without acknowledging that he was aware of the precise nature of the plot, Garnet attempted to dissuade Catesby from his course, to no avail. Garnet wrote to a colleague in Rome, Claudio Acquaviva, expressing his concerns about open rebellion in England. He also told Acquaviva that \"there is a risk that some private endeavour may commit treason or use force against the King\", and urged the pope to issue a public brief against the use of force.\nAccording to Fawkes, 20\u00a0barrels of gunpowder were brought in at first, followed by 16\u00a0more on 20 July. The supply of gunpowder was theoretically controlled by the government, but it was easily obtained from illicit sources. On 28 July, the ever-present threat of the plague again delayed the opening of Parliament, this time until Tuesday 5 November. Fawkes left the country for a short time. The King, meanwhile, spent much of the summer away from the city, hunting. He stayed wherever was convenient, including on occasion at the houses of prominent Catholics. Garnet, convinced that the threat of an uprising had receded, travelled the country on a pilgrimage.\nIt is uncertain when Fawkes returned to England, but he was back in London by late August, when he and Wintour discovered that the gunpowder stored in the undercroft had decayed. More gunpowder was brought into the room, along with firewood to conceal it. The final three conspirators were recruited in late 1605. At Michaelmas, Catesby persuaded the staunchly Catholic Ambrose Rookwood to rent Clopton House near Stratford-upon-Avon. Rookwood was a young man with recusant connections, whose stable of horses at Coldham Hall in Stanningfield, Suffolk was an important factor in his enlistment. His parents, Robert Rookwood and Dorothea Drury, were wealthy landowners, and had educated their son at a Jesuit school near Calais. Everard Digby was a young man who was generally well liked, and lived at Gayhurst House in Buckinghamshire. He had been knighted by the King in April 1603, and was converted to Catholicism by Gerard. Digby and his wife, Mary Mulshaw, had accompanied the priest on his pilgrimage, and the two men were reportedly close friends. Digby was asked by Catesby to rent Coughton Court near Alcester. Digby also promised \u00a31,500 after Percy failed to pay the rent due for the properties he had taken in Westminster. Finally, on 14 October Catesby invited Francis Tresham into the conspiracy. Tresham was the son of the Catholic Thomas Tresham, and a cousin to Robert Catesby; the two had been raised together. He was also the heir to his father's large fortune, which had been depleted by recusant fines, expensive tastes, and by Francis and Catesby's involvement in the Essex revolt.\nCatesby and Tresham met at the home of Tresham's brother-in-law and cousin, Lord Stourton. In his confession, Tresham claimed that he had asked Catesby if the plot would damn their souls, to which Catesby had replied it would not, and that the plight of England's Catholics required that it be done. Catesby also apparently asked for \u00a32,000, and the use of Rushton Hall in Northamptonshire. Tresham declined both offers (although he did give \u00a3100 to Thomas Wintour), and told his interrogators that he had moved his family from Rushton to London in advance of the plot; hardly the actions of a guilty man, he claimed.\nMonteagle letter.\nThe details of the plot were finalised in October, in a series of taverns across London and Daventry. Fawkes would be left to light the fuse and then escape across the Thames, while simultaneously a revolt in the Midlands would help to ensure the capture of the King's daughter, Elizabeth. Fawkes would leave for the continent, to explain events in England to the European Catholic powers.\nThe wives of those involved and Anne Vaux (a friend of Garnet who often shielded priests at her home) became increasingly concerned by what they suspected was about to happen. Several of the conspirators expressed worries about the safety of fellow Catholics who would be present in Parliament on the day of the planned explosion. Percy was concerned for his patron, Northumberland, and the young Earl of Arundel's name was brought up; Catesby suggested that a minor wound might keep him from the chamber on that day. The Lords Vaux, Montagu, Monteagle, and Stourton were also mentioned. Keyes suggested warning Lord Mordaunt, his wife's employer, to derision from Catesby.\nOn 26 October, a servant delivered a letter for Lord Monteagle to his house in Hoxton, that they received from a stranger on the road. The letter stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My Lord, out of the love I bear to some of your friends, I have a care of your preservation. Therefore I would advise you, as you tender your life, to devise some excuse to shift your attendance at this parliament; for God and man hath concurred to punish the wickedness of this time. And think not slightly of this advertisement, but retire yourself into your country where you may expect the event in safety. For though there be no appearance of any stir, yet I say they shall receive a terrible blow this Parliament; and yet they shall not see who hurts them. This counsel is not to be condemned because it may do you good and can do you no harm; for the danger is passed as soon as you have burnt the letter. And I hope God will give you the grace to make good use of it, to whose holy protection I commend you.\nUncertain of the letter's meaning, Monteagle promptly rode to Whitehall and handed it to Cecil (then Earl of Salisbury). Salisbury informed the Earl of Worcester, considered to have recusant sympathies, and the suspected Catholic Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton, but kept news of the plot from the King, who was busy hunting in Cambridgeshire and not expected back for several days. Monteagle's servant, Thomas Ward, had family connections with the Wright brothers, and sent a message to Catesby about the betrayal. Catesby, who had been due to go hunting with the King, suspected that Tresham was responsible for the letter, and with Thomas Wintour confronted the recently recruited conspirator. Tresham managed to convince the pair that he had not written the letter, but urged them to abandon the plot. Salisbury was already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, but did not yet know the exact nature of the plot, or who exactly was involved. He therefore elected to wait, to see how events unfolded.\nDiscovery.\nThe letter was shown to the King on the first of November following his arrival back in London. Upon reading it, James immediately seized upon the word \"blow\" and felt that it hinted at \"some strategem of fire and powder\", perhaps an explosion exceeding in violence the one that killed his father, Lord Darnley, at Kirk o' Field in 1567. Keen not to seem too intriguing, and wanting to allow the King to take the credit for unveiling the conspiracy, Salisbury feigned ignorance. The following day members of the Privy Council visited the King at the Palace of Whitehall and informed him that, based on the information that Salisbury had given them a week earlier, on Monday the Lord Chamberlain Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk, would undertake a search of the Houses of Parliament, \"both above and below\". On Sunday 3 November, Percy, Catesby and Wintour had a final meeting, where Percy told his colleagues that they should \"abide the uttermost triall\", and reminded them of their ship waiting at anchor on the Thames.\nBy 4 November, Digby was ensconced with a \"hunting party\" at Dunchurch, ready to abduct Elizabeth. The same day, Percy visited the Earl of Northumberland\u2014who was uninvolved in the conspiracy\u2014to see if he could discern what rumours surrounded the letter to Monteagle. Percy returned to London and assured Wintour, John Wright, and Robert Keyes that they had nothing to be concerned about, and returned to his lodgings on Gray's Inn Road. That same evening Catesby, likely accompanied by John Wright and Bates, set off for the Midlands. Fawkes visited Keyes, and was given a pocket watch left by Percy, to time the fuse, and an hour later Rookwood received several engraved swords from a local cutler.\nAlthough two accounts of the number of searches and their timing exist, according to the King's version, the first search of the buildings in and around Parliament was made on Monday 4 November\u2014as the plotters were busy making their final preparations\u2014by Suffolk, Monteagle, and John Whynniard. They found a large pile of firewood in the undercroft beneath the House of Lords, accompanied by what they presumed to be a serving man (Fawkes), who told them that the firewood belonged to his master, Thomas Percy. They left to report their findings, at which time Fawkes also left the building. The mention of Percy's name aroused further suspicion as he was already known to the authorities as a Catholic agitator. The King insisted that a more thorough search be undertaken. Late that night, the search party, headed by Thomas Knyvet, returned to the undercroft. They again found Fawkes, dressed in a cloak and hat, and wearing boots and spurs. He was arrested, whereupon he gave his name as John Johnson. He was carrying a lantern now held in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and a search of his person revealed a pocket watch, several slow matches and touchwood. Thirty-six barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of faggots and coal. Fawkes was taken to the King early on the morning of 5 November.\nFlight.\nAs news of \"John Johnson's\" arrest spread among the plotters still in London, most fled northwest, along Watling Street. Christopher Wright and Thomas Percy left together. Rookwood left soon after, and managed to cover 30\u00a0miles in two hours on one horse. He overtook Keyes, who had set off earlier, then Wright and Percy at Little Brickhill, before catching Catesby, John Wright, and Bates on the same road. Reunited, the group continued northwest to Dunchurch, using horses provided by Digby. Keyes went to Mordaunt's house at Drayton. Meanwhile, Thomas Wintour stayed in London, and even went to Westminster to see what was happening. When he realised the plot had been uncovered, he took his horse and made for his sister's house at Norbrook, before continuing to Huddington Court.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOn the 5th of November we began our Parliament, to which the King should have come in person, but refrained through a practise but that morning discovered. The plot was to have blown up the King at such time as he should have been set on his Royal Throne, accompanied with all his Children, Nobility and Commoners and assisted with all Bishops, Judges and Doctors; at one instant and blast to have ruin'd the whole State and Kingdom of England. And for the effecting of this, there was placed under the Parliament House, where the king should sit, some 30\u00a0barrels of powder, with good store of wood, faggots, pieces and bars of iron.\n Extract of a letter from Sir Edward Hoby (Gentleman of the Bedchamber) to Sir Thomas Edwards, Ambassador at Brussells [\"sic\"]\nThe group of six conspirators stopped at Ashby St Ledgers at about 6\u00a0pm, where they met Robert Wintour and updated him on their situation. They then continued on to Dunchurch, and met with Digby. Catesby convinced him that despite the plot's failure, an armed struggle was still a real possibility. He announced to Digby's \"hunting party\" that the King and Salisbury were dead, before the fugitives moved west to Warwick.\nIn London, news of the plot was spreading, and the authorities set extra guards on the city gates, closed the ports, and protected the house of the Spanish Ambassador, which was surrounded by an angry mob. An arrest warrant was issued against Thomas Percy, and his patron, the Earl of Northumberland, was placed under house arrest. In \"John Johnson's\" initial interrogation he revealed nothing other than the name of his mother, and that he was from Yorkshire. A letter to Guy Fawkes was discovered on his person, but he claimed that name was one of his aliases. Far from denying his intentions, \"Johnson\" stated that it had been his purpose to destroy the King and Parliament. Nevertheless, he maintained his composure and insisted that he had acted alone. His unwillingness to yield so impressed the King that he described him as possessing \"a Roman resolution\".\nInvestigation.\nOn 6 November, the Lord Chief Justice, Sir John Popham (a man with a deep-seated hatred of Catholics) questioned Rookwood's servants. By the evening he had learned the names of several of those involved in the conspiracy: Catesby, Rookwood, Keyes, Wynter [\"sic\"], John and Christopher Wright, and Grant. \"Johnson\" meanwhile persisted with his story, and along with the gunpowder he was found with, was moved to the Tower of London, where the King had decided that \"Johnson\" would be tortured. The use of torture was forbidden, except by royal prerogative or a body such as the Privy Council or Star Chamber. In a letter of 6 November James wrote: \"The gentler tortours [tortures] are to be first used unto him, [and thus by steps extended to the bottom depths], and so God speed your good work.\" \"Johnson\" may have been placed in manacles and hung from the wall, but he was almost certainly subjected to the horrors of the rack. On 7 November his resolve was broken; he confessed late that day, and again over the following two days.\nLast stand.\nOn 6 November, with Fawkes maintaining his silence, the fugitives raided Warwick Castle for supplies, then continued to Norbrook to collect weapons. From there they continued their journey to Huddington. Bates left the group and travelled to Coughton Court to deliver a letter from Catesby, to Garnet and the other priests, informing them of what had transpired, and asking for their help in raising an army. Garnet replied by begging Catesby and his followers to stop their \"wicked actions\", before himself fleeing. Several priests set out for Warwick, worried about the fate of their colleagues. They were caught, and then imprisoned in London. Catesby and the others arrived at Huddington early in the afternoon, and were met by Thomas Wintour. They received practically no support or sympathy from those they met, including family members, who were terrified at the prospect of being associated with treason. They continued on to Holbeche House on the border of Staffordshire, the home of Stephen Littleton, a member of their ever-decreasing band of followers. Whilst there, Stephen Littleton and Thomas Wintour went to Pepperhill, the Shropshire residence at Boningale of Robert Wintour's father-in-law John Talbot, to gain support, but to no avail. Tired and desperate, they spread out some of the now-soaked gunpowder in front of the fire, to dry out. Although gunpowder does not explode unless physically contained, a spark from the fire landed on the powder and the resultant flames engulfed Catesby, Rookwood, Grant, and a man named Morgan, who was a member of the hunting party.\nThomas Wintour and Littleton, on their way from Huddington to Holbeche House, were told by a messenger that Catesby had died. At that point, Littleton left, but Thomas arrived at the house to find Catesby alive, albeit scorched. John Grant was not so lucky, and had been blinded by the fire. Digby, Robert Wintour and his half-brother John, and Thomas Bates, had all left. Of the plotters, only the singed figures of Catesby and Grant, the Wright brothers, Rookwood, and Percy remained. The fugitives resolved to stay in the house and wait for the arrival of the King's men.\nRichard Walsh (Sheriff of Worcestershire) and his company of 200\u00a0men besieged Holbeche House on the morning of 8 November. Thomas Wintour was hit in the shoulder while crossing the courtyard. John Wright was shot, followed by his brother, and then Rookwood. Catesby and Percy were reportedly killed by a single lucky shot. The attackers rushed the property, and stripped the dead or dying defenders of their clothing. Grant, Morgan, Rookwood, and Wintour were arrested.\nReaction.\nBates and Keyes were captured shortly after Holbeche House was taken. Digby, who had intended to give himself up, was caught by a small group of pursuers. Tresham was arrested on 12 November, and taken to the Tower three days later. Montague, Mordaunt, and Stourton (Tresham's brother-in-law) were also imprisoned in the Tower. The Earl of Northumberland joined them on 27 November. Meanwhile, the government used the revelation of the plot to accelerate its persecution of Catholics. The home of Anne Vaux at Enfield Chase was searched, revealing the presence of trap doors and hidden passages. A terrified servant then revealed that Garnet, who had often stayed at the house, had recently given a Mass there. John Gerard was secreted at the home of Elizabeth Vaux, in Harrowden. Vaux was taken to London for interrogation. There she was resolute: she had never been aware that Gerard was a priest, she had presumed he was a \"Catholic gentleman\", and she did not know of his whereabouts. The homes of the conspirators were searched, and looted; Mary Digby's household was ransacked, and she was made destitute. Some time before the end of November, Garnet moved to Hindlip Hall near Worcester, the home of the Habingtons, where he wrote a letter to the Privy Council protesting his innocence.\nThe foiling of the Gunpowder Plot initiated a wave of national relief at the delivery of the King and his sons, and inspired in the ensuing parliament a mood of loyalty and goodwill, which Salisbury astutely exploited to extract higher subsidies for the King than any (bar one) granted in Elizabeth I's reign. Walter Raleigh, who was languishing in the Tower owing to his involvement in the Main Plot, and whose wife was a first cousin of Lady Catesby, declared he had had no knowledge of the conspiracy. The Bishop of Rochester gave a sermon at St. Paul's Cross, in which he condemned the plot. In his speech to both Houses on 9 November, James expounded on two emerging preoccupations of his monarchy: the divine right of kings and the Catholic question. He insisted that the plot had been the work of only a few Catholics, not of the English Catholics as a whole, and he reminded the assembly to rejoice at his survival, since kings were divinely appointed and he owed his escape to a miracle. Salisbury wrote to his English ambassadors abroad, informing them of what had occurred, and also reminding them that the King bore no ill will to his Catholic neighbours. The foreign powers largely distanced themselves from the plotters, calling them atheists and Protestant heretics.\nInterrogations.\nSir Edward Coke was in charge of the interrogations. Over a period of about ten weeks, in the Lieutenant's Lodgings at the Tower of London (now known as the Queen's House) he questioned those who had been implicated in the plot. For the first round of interrogations, no real proof exists that these people were tortured, although on several occasions Salisbury certainly suggested that they should be. Coke later revealed that the threat of torture was in most cases enough to elicit a confession from those caught up in the aftermath of the plot.\nOnly two confessions were printed in full: Fawkes's confession of 8 November, and Wintour's of 23 November. Having been involved in the conspiracy from the start (unlike Fawkes), Wintour was able to give extremely valuable information to the Privy Council. The handwriting on his testimony is almost certainly that of the man himself, but his signature was markedly different. Wintour had previously only ever signed his name as such, but his confession is signed \"Winter\", and since he had been shot in the shoulder, the steady hand used to write the signature may indicate some measure of government interference\u2014or it may indicate that writing a shorter version of his name was less painful. Wintour's testimony makes no mention of his brother, Robert. Both were published in the so-called \"King's Book\", a hastily written official account of the conspiracy published in late November 1605.\nHenry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, was in a difficult position. His midday dinner with Thomas Percy on 4 November was damning evidence against him, and after Thomas Percy's death there was nobody who could either implicate him or clear him. The Privy Council suspected that Northumberland would have been Princess Elizabeth's protector had the plot succeeded, but there was insufficient evidence to convict him. Northumberland remained in the Tower and on 27 June 1606 was finally charged with contempt. He was stripped of all public offices, fined \u00a330,000 (about \u00a3 in 2023), and kept in the Tower until June 1621. The Lords Mordaunt and Stourton were tried in the Star Chamber. They were condemned to imprisonment in the Tower, where they remained until 1608, when they were transferred to the Fleet Prison. Both were also given significant fines.\nSeveral other people not involved in the conspiracy, but known or related to the conspirators, were also questioned. Northumberland's brothers, Sir Allen and Sir Josceline Percy, were arrested. Lord Montagu had employed Fawkes at an early age, and had also met Catesby on 29 October, and was therefore of interest; he was released several months later. Agnes Wenman was from a Catholic family, and related to Elizabeth Vaux. She was examined twice but the charges against her were eventually dropped. Percy's secretary and later the controller of Northumberland's household, Dudley Carleton, had leased the vault where the gunpowder was stored, and consequently he was imprisoned in the Tower. Salisbury believed his story, and authorised his release.\nJesuits.\nThomas Bates confessed on 4 December, providing much of the information that Salisbury needed to link the Catholic clergy to the plot. Bates had been present at most of the conspirators' meetings, and under interrogation he implicated Tesimond in the plot. On 13 January 1606, he described how he had visited Garnet and Tesimond on 7 November to inform Garnet of the plot's failure. Bates also told his interrogators of his ride with Tesimond to Huddington, before the priest left him to head for the Habingtons at Hindlip Hall, and of a meeting between Garnet, Gerard, and Tesimond in October 1605.\nAt about the same time in December, Tresham's health began to deteriorate. He was visited regularly by his wife, a nurse, and his servant William Vavasour\u2014who documented his strangury. Before he died, Tresham had also told of Garnet's involvement with the 1603 mission to Spain, but in his last hours he retracted some of these statements. Nowhere in his confession did he mention the Monteagle letter. He died early on the morning of 23 December, and was buried in the Tower. Nevertheless, he was attainted along with the other plotters; his head was set on a pike either (accounts differ) at Northampton or London Bridge, and his estates confiscated.\nOn 15 January a proclamation named Garnet, Gerard, and Greenway (Tesimond) as wanted men. Tesimond and Gerard escaped the country and lived out their days in freedom. Several days earlier, on 9 January, Robert Wintour and Stephen Littleton had been captured. They had been hiding at Hagley, the home of Humphrey Littleton, brother of MP John Littleton, imprisoned for treason in 1601 for his part in the Essex revolt. They were betrayed by a cook, who grew suspicious of the amount of food sent up for his master's consumption. Humphrey denied the presence of the two fugitives, but another servant led the authorities to their hiding place. On 20 January, the local Justice of the Peace and his retainers arrived at Thomas Habington's home, Hindlip Hall, to arrest the Jesuits. Despite Thomas Habington's protests, the men spent the next four days searching the house. On 24 January, starving, the Jesuit lay-brothers Nicholas Owen (Jesuit) (who had built the hides at Hindlip) and Ralph Ashley, the servant of Edward Oldcorne (Habington's chaplain) left their hiding place and were arrested. Humphrey Littleton, who had escaped from the authorities at Hagley, got as far as Prestwood in Staffordshire before he was captured. He was imprisoned, and then condemned to death at Worcester. On 26 January, in an attempt to trade his friends for his life, he told the authorities where they could find Garnet. Worn down by hiding for so long, Garnet, accompanied by Oldcorne, emerged from his priest hole the next day.\nTrials.\nBy coincidence, on the same day that Garnet was found, the surviving conspirators were arraigned in Westminster Hall. Seven of the prisoners were taken from the Tower to the Star Chamber by barge. Bates, who was considered lower class, was brought from the Gatehouse Prison. Some of the prisoners were reportedly despondent, but others were nonchalant, even smoking tobacco. The King and his family, hidden from view, were among the many who watched the trial. The Lords Commissioners present were the Earls of Suffolk, Worcester, Northampton, Devonshire, and Salisbury. Sir John Popham was Lord Chief Justice, Sir Thomas Fleming was Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, and two Justices, Sir Thomas Walmsley and Sir Peter Warburton, sat as Justices of the Common Pleas. The list of traitors' names was read aloud, beginning with the priests: Garnet, Tesimond, and Gerard.\nThe first to speak was the Speaker of the House of Commons (later Master of the Rolls), Sir Edward Philips, who described the intent behind the plot in lurid detail. He was followed by the Attorney-General Sir Edward Coke, who began with a long speech\u2014heavily influenced by Salisbury\u2014that included a denial that the King had ever made any promises to the Catholics. Monteagle's part in the discovery of the plot was welcomed, and denunciations of the 1603 mission to Spain featured strongly. Fawkes's protestations that Gerard knew nothing of the plot were omitted from Coke's speech. The foreign powers, when mentioned, were accorded due respect, but the priests were accursed, their behaviour criticised wherever possible. There was little doubt, according to Coke, that the plot had been invented by the Jesuits. Garnet's meeting with Catesby, at which the former was said to have absolved the latter of any blame in the plot, was proof enough that the Jesuits were central to the conspiracy; according to Coke the Gunpowder Plot would always be known as the \"Jesuit Treason\". Coke spoke with feeling of the probable fate of the Queen and the rest of the King's family, and of the innocents who would have been caught up in the explosion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI never yet knew a treason without a Romish priest; but in this there are very many Jesuits, who are known to have dealt and passed through the whole action.\n Sir Edward Coke\nEach of the condemned, said Coke, would be drawn backwards to his death, by a horse, his head near the ground. He was to be \"put to death halfway between heaven and earth as unworthy of both\". His genitals would be cut off and burnt before his eyes, and his bowels and heart then removed. Then he would be decapitated, and the dismembered parts of his body displayed so that they might become \"prey for the fowls of the air\". Confessions and declarations from the prisoners were then read aloud, and finally the prisoners were allowed to speak. Rookwood claimed that he had been drawn into the plot by Catesby, \"whom he loved above any worldy man\". Thomas Wintour begged to be hanged for himself and his brother, so that his brother might be spared. Fawkes explained his not-guilty plea as ignorance of aspects of the indictment. Keyes appeared to accept his fate, Bates and Robert Wintour begged for mercy, and Grant explained his involvement as \"a conspiracy intended but never effected\". Only Digby, tried on a separate indictment, pleaded guilty, insisting that the King had reneged upon promises of toleration for Catholics, and that affection for Catesby and love of the Catholic cause mitigated his actions. He sought death by the axe and begged mercy from the King for his young family. His arguments were rebuked by Coke and Northumberland, and along with his seven co-conspirators, he was found guilty by the jury of high treason. Digby shouted \"If I may but hear any of your lordships say, you forgive me, I shall go more cheerfully to the gallows.\" The response was short: \"God forgive you, and we do.\"\nGarnet may have been questioned on as many as 23\u00a0occasions. His response to the threat of the rack was \" [Threats are only for boys]\", and he denied having encouraged Catholics to pray for the success of the \"Catholic Cause\". His interrogators resorted to the forgery of correspondence between Garnet and other Catholics, but to no avail. His jailers then allowed him to talk with another priest in a neighbouring cell, with eavesdroppers listening. Eventually Garnet let slip a crucial detail, that there was only one man who could testify that he had any knowledge of the plot. Under torture Garnet admitted that he had heard of the plot from fellow Jesuit Oswald Tesimond, who had learnt of it in confession from Catesby. Garnet was charged with high treason and tried in the Guildhall on 28 March from 8\u00a0am until 7\u00a0pm. According to Coke, Garnet instigated the plot, but Garnet refuted all the charges against him; he was found guilty and sentenced to death.\nExecutions.\nAlthough Catesby and Percy escaped the executioner, their bodies were exhumed and decapitated, and their heads exhibited on spikes outside the House of Lords. On 30 January, Everard Digby, Robert Wintour, John Grant, and Thomas Bates were tied to hurdles\u2014wooden panels\u2014and dragged through the crowded streets of London to St Paul's Churchyard. Digby, the first to mount the scaffold, asked the spectators for forgiveness, and refused a Protestant clergyman. He was stripped of his clothing, and wearing only a shirt, climbed the ladder to place his head through the noose. He was quickly cut down, and while still fully conscious was castrated, disembowelled, and then quartered, along with the three other prisoners. The following day, Thomas Wintour, Ambrose Rookwood, Robert Keyes, and Guy Fawkes were hanged, drawn and quartered, opposite the building they had planned to blow up, in the Old Palace Yard at Westminster. Keyes did not wait for the hangman's command and jumped from the gallows, but he survived the drop and was led to the quartering block. Although weakened by his torture, Fawkes managed to jump from the gallows and break his neck, avoiding the agony of the gruesome latter part of his execution.\nSteven Littleton was executed at Stafford. His cousin Humphrey, despite his co-operation, met his end at Red Hill near Worcester. Henry Garnet was executed on 3 May 1606.\nAftermath.\nThe discovery of such a wide-ranging conspiracy and the subsequent trials led Parliament to consider new anti-Catholic legislation. The event destroyed all hope that the Spanish would ever secure tolerance of the Catholics in England. In the summer of 1606, laws against recusancy were strengthened; the Popish Recusants Act returned England to the Elizabethan system of fines and restrictions, introduced a sacramental test, and an Oath of Allegiance, requiring Catholics to abjure as a \"heresy\" the doctrine that \"princes excommunicated by the Pope could be deposed or assassinated\". Catholic emancipation took another 200\u00a0years, but many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during James I's reign. Although there was no \"golden time\" of \"toleration\" of Catholics, which Garnet had hoped for, James's reign was nevertheless a period of relative leniency for Catholics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFaith, here's an equivocator, that could swear in both the scales against either scale; who committed treason enough for God's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven\n \"Macbeth\", Act 2 Scene 3\nThe playwright William Shakespeare seems to have featured the events of the Gunpowder Plot alongside the earlier Gowrie conspiracy in \"Macbeth\", written between 1603 and 1607.\nInterest in the demonic was heightened by the Gunpowder Plot. The King had become engaged in the great debate about other-worldly powers in writing his \"Daemonologie\" in 1599, before he became King of England as well as Scotland. Chiasmi seen in such lines as \"fair is foul and foul is fair\" are used frequently, and another possible reference to the plot relates to the use of equivocation; Garnet's \"A Treatise of Equivocation\" was found on one of the plotters. Poets made a point of describing it as an act so evil that not only was its evil, in John Milton's words, \"sine nomine\" in the English language, other neo-Latin poetry described it as (\"inaudito\"), unheard of, even among the most wicked nations of history:\nNeither the Carthaginians infamous in the name of perfidy nor the cruel Scythian nor Turk or the dreaded Sarmatian, nor the Anthropophagi, nurslings of mad savagery, nor any nation as barbarous in the furthermost regions of the world has heard.\nMilton wrote a poem in 1626 that one commentator has called a \"critically vexing poem\", \"In Quintum Novembris\". Reflecting \"partisan public sentiment on an English-Protestant national holiday\", in the published editions of 1645 and 1673, the poem is preceded by five epigrams on the subject of the Gunpowder Plot, apparently written by Milton in preparation for the larger work. The plot may also have influenced his later work, \"Paradise Lost\".\nIn \"What If the Gunpowder Plot Had Succeeded?\" historian Ronald Hutton concluded that a successful implementation of the plot would have prompted a severe backlash against suspected Catholics, and that without foreign assistance a successful rebellion would have been unlikely; despite differing religious convictions, most Englishmen were loyal to the monarchy. England might have become a more \"Puritan absolute monarchy\", as \"existed in Sweden, Denmark, Saxony, and Prussia in the seventeenth century\", rather than following the path of parliamentary and civil reform that it did.\nAccusations of state conspiracy.\nMany at the time felt that Salisbury had been involved in the plot to gain favour with the King and enact more stridently anti-Catholic legislation. Such conspiracy theories alleged that Salisbury had either actually invented the plot or allowed it to continue when his agents had already infiltrated it, for the purposes of propaganda. The Popish Plot of 1678 sparked renewed interest in the Gunpowder Plot, resulting in a book by Thomas Barlow, Bishop of Lincoln, which refuted \"a bold and groundless surmise that all this was a contrivance of Secretary Cecil\".\nIn 1897 John Gerard of Stonyhurst College, namesake of John Gerard (who, following the plot's discovery, had evaded capture), wrote an account called \"What was the Gunpowder Plot?\", alleging Salisbury's culpability. This prompted a refutation later that year by Samuel Gardiner, who argued that Gerard had gone too far in trying to \"wipe away the reproach\" which the plot had exacted on generations of English Catholics. Gardiner portrayed Salisbury as guilty of nothing more than opportunism. Subsequent attempts to prove Salisbury's involvement, such as Francis Edwards's 1969 work \"Guy Fawkes: the real story of the gunpowder plot?\", have similarly foundered on the lack of any clear evidence.\nThe cellars under the Houses of Parliament continued to be leased to private individuals until 1678, when news of the Popish Plot broke. It was then considered prudent to search the cellars on the day before each State Opening of Parliament, a ritual that survives to this day.\nBonfire Night.\nIn January 1606, during the first sitting of Parliament since the plot, the Observance of 5th November Act 1605 was passed, making services commemorating the event an annual feature of English life; the act remained in force until 1859. The tradition of marking the day with the ringing of church bells and bonfires started soon after the Plot's discovery, and fireworks were included in some of the earliest celebrations. In Britain, 5 November is variously called Bonfire Night, Fireworks Night, or Guy Fawkes Night.\n5 November firework displays and bonfire parties are common throughout Britain. Traditionally, in the weeks running up to the 5th, children made \"guys\"\u2014effigies supposedly of Fawkes\u2014usually made from old clothes stuffed with newspaper, and fitted with a grotesque mask, to be burnt on bonfires. These \"guys\" were exhibited to collect money for fireworks, although this custom has become less common. The word \"guy\", in the 19th century, thus came to mean an oddly dressed person and, in the 20th and 21st centuries, any male person.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;Remember, remember,\nThe Fifth of November,\nGunpowder treason and plot;\nFor I see no reason\nWhy Gunpowder Treason\nShould ever be forgot.&lt;/poem&gt;\n Nursery rhyme\nAccording to the biographer Esther Forbes, Guy Fawkes Day in the pre-revolutionary American colonies was a very popular holiday. In Boston, the revelry on \"Pope Night\" took on anti-authoritarian overtones, and often became so dangerous that many would not venture out of their homes.\nReconstructing the explosion.\nIn the 2005 ITV programme \"\", a full-size replica of the House of Lords was built and destroyed with barrels of gunpowder, totalling 1 tonne of explosives. The experiment was conducted on the Advantica-owned Spadeadam test site and demonstrated that the explosion\u2014if the gunpowder had been in good order\u2014would have killed all those in the building. The power of the explosion was such that of the deep concrete walls making up the undercroft (replicating how archives suggest the walls of the old House of Lords were constructed), the end wall where the barrels were placed, under the throne, was reduced to rubble, and the adjacent surviving portions of wall were shoved away. A piece of the head of the dummy representing King James, which had been placed on a throne inside the chamber, was found a considerable distance from its initial location. According to the findings of the programme, no one within of the blast could have survived, and all of the stained glass windows in Westminster Abbey would have shattered. The explosion would have been seen from miles away and heard from further still. Even if only half of the gunpowder had gone off\u2014which Fawkes was apparently prepared for\u2014everyone in the House of Lords would have been killed instantly.\nThe programme also disproved claims that deterioration in the quality of the gunpowder would have prevented the explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder, of such low quality as to make it unusable in firearms, still created a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been magnified by its containment in wooden barrels. The compression would have created a cannon effect, with the powder first blowing up from the top of the barrel before, a millisecond later, blowing out. Calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of gunpowder, had deployed double the amount needed.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is brittle when dry and rubbery when moist. It may also be referred to as hydrolyzed collagen, collagen hydrolysate, gelatine hydrolysate, hydrolyzed gelatine, and collagen peptides after it has undergone hydrolysis. It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, beverages, medications, drug or vitamin capsules, photographic films, papers and cosmetics.\nSubstances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called gelatinous substances. Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolyzed form of collagen, wherein the hydrolysis reduces protein fibrils into smaller peptides; depending on the physical and chemical methods of denaturation, the molecular weight of the peptides falls within a broad range. Gelatin is present in gelatin desserts, most gummy candy and marshmallows, ice creams, dips, and yogurts. Gelatin for cooking comes as powder, granules, and sheets. Instant types can be added to the food as they are; others must soak in water beforehand.\nGelatin is a natural polymer derived from collagen through hydrolysis. Its chemical structure is primarily composed of amino acids, including glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline. These amino acid chains form a three-dimensional network through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions giving gelatin its gelling properties. Gelatin dissolves well in water and can form reversible gel-like substances. When cooled, water is trapped within its network structure, resulting in what is known as a hydrogel.\nAs a hydrogel, gelatin's uniqueness lies in its ability to maintain a stable structure and function even when it contains up to 90% water. This makes gelatin widely used in medical, food and cosmetic industries, especially in drug delivery systems and wound dressings, as it provides stable hydration and promotes the healing process. Moreover, its biodegradability and biocompatibility make it an ideal hydrogel material. Research on hydrolyzed collagen shows no established benefit for joint health, though it is being explored for wound care. While safety concerns exist due to its animal origins, regulatory bodies have determined the risk of disease transmission to be very low when standard processing methods are followed.\nCharacteristics.\nProperties.\nGelatin is a collection of peptides and proteins produced by partial hydrolysis of collagen extracted from the skin, bones, and connective tissues of animals such as domesticated cattle, chicken, pigs, and fish. During hydrolysis, some of the bonds between and within component proteins are broken. Its chemical composition is, in many aspects, closely similar to that of its parent collagen. Photographic and pharmaceutical grades of gelatin generally are sourced from cattle bones and pig skin. Gelatin is classified as a hydrogel.\nGelatin is nearly tasteless and odorless with a colorless or slightly yellow appearance. It is transparent and brittle, and it can come as sheets, flakes, or as a powder. Polar solvents like hot water, glycerol, and acetic acid can dissolve gelatin, but it is insoluble in organic solvents like alcohol. Gelatin absorbs 5\u201310 times its weight in water to form a gel. The gel formed by gelatin can be melted by reheating, and it has an increasing viscosity under stress (thixotropic). The upper melting point of gelatin is below human body temperature, a factor that is important for mouthfeel of foods produced with gelatin. The viscosity of the gelatin-water mixture is greatest when the gelatin concentration is high and the mixture is kept cool at about . Commercial gelatin will have a gel strength of around 90 to 300 grams Bloom using the Bloom test of gel strength. Gelatin's strength (but not viscosity) declines if it is subjected to temperatures above , or if it is held at temperatures near 100\u00a0\u00b0C for an extended period of time.\nGelatins have diverse melting points and gelation temperatures, depending on the source. For example, gelatin derived from fish has a lower melting and gelation point than gelatin derived from beef or pork.\nComposition.\nWhen dry, gelatin consists of 98\u201399% protein, but it is not a nutritionally complete protein since it is missing tryptophan and is deficient in isoleucine, threonine, and methionine. The amino acid content of hydrolyzed collagen is the same as collagen. Hydrolyzed collagen contains 19 amino acids, predominantly glycine (Gly) 26\u201334%, proline (Pro) 10\u201318%, and hydroxyproline (Hyp) 7\u201315%, which together represent around 50% of the total amino acid content. Glycine is responsible for close packing of the chains. Presence of proline restricts the conformation. This is important for gelation properties of gelatin. Other amino acids that contribute highly include: alanine (Ala) 8\u201311%; arginine (Arg) 8\u20139%; aspartic acid (Asp) 6\u20137%; and glutamic acid (Glu) 10\u201312%.\nResearch.\nIn 2011, the European Food Safety Authority Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies concluded that \"a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the consumption of collagen hydrolysate and maintenance of joints\".\nHydrolyzed collagen has been investigated as a type of wound dressing aimed at correcting imbalances in the wound microenvironment and the treatment of refractory wounds (chronic wounds that do not respond to normal treatment), as well as deep second-degree burn wounds.\nSafety concerns.\nHydrolyzed collagen, like gelatin, is made from animal by-products from the meat industry or sometimes animal carcasses removed and cleared by knackers, including skin, bones, and connective tissue.\nIn 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with support from the TSE (transmissible spongiform encephalopathy) Advisory Committee, began monitoring the potential risk of transmitting animal diseases, especially bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as \"mad cow disease\". An FDA study from that year stated: \"... steps such as heat, alkaline treatment, and filtration could be effective in reducing the level of contaminating TSE agents; however, scientific evidence is insufficient at this time to demonstrate that these treatments would effectively remove the BSE infectious agent if present in the source material.\" On 18 March 2016, the FDA finalized three previously issued interim final rules designed to further reduce the potential risk of BSE in human food. The final rule clarified that \"gelatin is not considered a prohibited cattle material if it is manufactured using the customary industry processes specified.\"\nThe Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) of the European Union in 2003 stated that the risk associated with bovine bone gelatin is very low or zero.\nIn 2006, the European Food Safety Authority stated that the SSC opinion was confirmed, that the BSE risk of bone-derived gelatin was small, and that it recommended removal of the 2003 request to exclude the skull, brain, and vertebrae of bovine origin older than 12 months from the material used in gelatin manufacturing.\nProduction.\nIn 2019, the worldwide demand of gelatin was about . On a commercial scale, gelatin is made from by-products of the meat and leather industries.\nMost gelatin is derived from pork skins, pork and cattle bones, or split cattle hides. Gelatin made from fish by-products avoids some of the religious objections to gelatin consumption. The raw materials are prepared by different curing, acid, and alkali processes that are employed to extract the dried collagen hydrolysate. These processes may take several weeks, and differences in such processes have great effects on the properties of the final gelatin products.\nGelatin also can be prepared at home. Boiling certain cartilaginous cuts of meat or bones results in gelatin being dissolved into the water. Depending on the concentration, the resulting stock (when cooled) will form a jelly or gel naturally. This process is used for aspic.\nWhile many processes exist whereby collagen may be converted to gelatin, they all have several factors in common. The intermolecular and intramolecular bonds that stabilize insoluble collagen must be broken, and also, the hydrogen bonds that stabilize the collagen helix must be broken. The manufacturing processes of gelatin consists of several main stages:\nPretreatments.\nIf the raw material used in the production of the gelatin is derived from bones, dilute acid solutions are used to remove calcium and other salts. Hot water or several solvents may be used to reduce the fat content, which should not exceed 1% before the main extraction step. If the raw material consists of hides and skin, then size reduction, washing, hair removal, and degreasing are necessary to prepare the materials for the hydrolysis step.\nHydrolysis.\nAfter preparation of the raw material, i.e., removing some of the impurities such as fat and salts, partially purified collagen is converted into gelatin through hydrolysis. Collagen hydrolysis is performed by one of three different methods: acid-, alkali-, and enzymatic hydrolysis. Acid treatment is especially suitable for less fully cross-linked materials such as pig skin collagen and normally requires 10 to 48 hours. Alkali treatment is suitable for more complex collagen such as that found in bovine hides and requires more time, normally several weeks. The purpose of the alkali treatment is to destroy certain chemical crosslinks still present in collagen. Within the gelatin industry, the gelatin obtained from acid-treated raw material has been called type-A gelatin and the gelatin obtained from alkali-treated raw material is referred to as type-B gelatin.\nAdvances are occurring to optimize the yield of gelatin using enzymatic hydrolysis of collagen. The treatment time is shorter than that required for alkali treatment, and results in almost complete conversion to the pure product. The physical properties of the final gelatin product are considered better.\nExtraction.\nExtraction is performed with either water or acid solutions at appropriate temperatures. All industrial processes are based on neutral or acid pH values because although alkali treatments speed up conversion, they also promote degradation processes. Acidic extraction conditions are extensively used in the industry, but the degree of acid varies with different processes. This extraction step is a multistage process, and the extraction temperature usually is increased in later extraction steps, which ensures minimum thermal degradation of the extracted gelatin.\nRecovery.\nThis process includes several steps such as filtration, evaporation, drying, grinding, and sifting. These operations are concentration-dependent and also dependent on the particular gelatin used. Gelatin degradation should be avoided and minimized, so the lowest temperature possible is used for the recovery process. Most recoveries are rapid, with all of the processes being done in several stages to avoid extensive deterioration of the peptide structure. A deteriorated peptide structure would result in a low gel strength, which is not generally desired.\nUses.\nEarly history of food applications.\nThe 10th-century \"Kitab al-Tabikh\" includes a recipe for a fish aspic, made by boiling fish heads.\nA recipe for jelled meat broth is found in \"Le Viandier\", written in or around 1375.\nIn 15th century Britain, cattle hooves were boiled to produce a gel. By the late 17th century, the French inventor Denis Papin had discovered another method of gelatin extraction via boiling of bones. An English patent for gelatin production was granted in 1754. In 1812, the chemist Jean-Pierre-Joseph d'Arcet further experimented with the use of hydrochloric acid to extract gelatin from bones, and later with steam extraction, which was much more efficient. The French government viewed gelatin as a potential source of cheap, accessible protein for the poor, particularly in Paris.\nFood applications in France and the United States during the 19th century appear to have established the versatility of gelatin, including the origin of its popularity in the US as Jell-O. In the mid-19th century, the American industrialist and inventor, Peter Cooper, registered a patent for a gelatin dessert powder he called \"Portable Gelatin\", which only needed the addition of water. In the late 19th century, Charles and Rose Knox set up the Charles B. Knox Gelatin Company in New York, which promoted and popularized the use of gelatin.\nCulinary uses.\nA common gelling agent in cooking, different types and grades of gelatin are used in a wide range of food and nonfood products. Common examples of foods that contain gelatin are gelatin desserts, trifles, aspic, marshmallows, candy corn, and confections such as Peeps, gummy bears, fruit snacks, and jelly babies. Gelatin may be used as a stabilizer, thickener, or texturizer in foods such as yogurt, cream cheese, and margarine; it is used, as well, in fat-reduced foods to simulate the mouthfeel of fat and to create volume. It also is used in the production of several types of Chinese soup dumplings, specifically Shanghainese soup dumplings, or \"xiaolongbao\", as well as \"Shengjian mantou\", a type of fried and steamed dumpling. The fillings of both are made by combining ground pork with gelatin cubes, and in the process of cooking, the gelatin melts, creating a soupy interior with a characteristic gelatinous stickiness.\nGelatin is used for the clarification of juices, such as apple juice, and of vinegar.\nIsinglass is obtained from the swim bladders of fish. It is used as a fining agent for wine and beer. Besides hartshorn jelly, from deer antlers (hence the name \"hartshorn\"), isinglass was one of the oldest sources of gelatin.\nCosmetics.\nIn cosmetics, hydrolyzed collagen may be found in topical creams, acting as a product texture conditioner, and moisturizer. Collagen implants or dermal fillers are also used to address the appearance of wrinkles, contour deficiencies, and acne scars, among others. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved its use, and identifies cow (bovine) and human cells as the sources of these fillers. According to the FDA, the desired effects can last for 3\u20134 months, which is relatively the most short-lived compared to other materials used for the same purpose.\nGelatin derivatives.\nGelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) is a chemically modified derivative of gelatin, produced by introducing methacryloyl functional groups onto gelatin's amine and hydroxyl residues. This modification allows GelMA to undergo photocrosslinking in the presence of a photoinitiator, forming stable hydrogels with tunable mechanical properties. Additionally, the introduction of methacrylated groups enhances GelMA's mucoadhesive properties, making it particularly useful for mucosal drug delivery applications. Due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ability to mimic the extracellular matrix, GelMA has gained widespread applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery, and biofabrication. It is particularly useful in 3D bioprinting, wound healing, and the development of organ-on-a-chip models. Its capacity to support cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation further makes it an attractive biomaterial for regenerative medicine and biomedical research.\nReligious considerations.\nThe consumption of gelatin from particular animals may be forbidden by religious rules or cultural taboos.\nIslamic halal and Jewish kosher customs generally require gelatin from sources other than pigs, such as cattle that have been slaughtered according to religious regulations (halal or kosher), or fish (that Jews and Muslims are allowed to consume).\nOn the other hand, some Islamic jurists have argued that the chemical treatment \"purifies\" the gelatin enough to always be halal, an argument most common in the field of medicine.\nIt has similarly been argued that gelatin in medicine is permissible in Judaism, as it is not used as food. According to \"The Jewish Dietary Laws\", the book of kosher guidelines published by the Rabbinical Assembly, the organization of Conservative Jewish rabbis, all gelatin is kosher and pareve because the chemical transformation undergone in the manufacturing process renders it a different physical and chemical substance.\nBuddhist, Hindu, and Jain customs may require gelatin alternatives from sources other than animals, as many Hindus, almost all Jains and some Buddhists are vegetarian.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

This kind of dessert was first recorded as \"jelly\" by Hannah Glasse in her 18th-century book \"The Art of Cookery\", appearing in a layer of trifle. Jelly recipes are included in the 19th-century cookbooks of the English food writers Eliza Acton and Isabella Beeton.\nJelly can be made by combining plain gelatine with other ingredients or by using a premixed blend of gelatine with additives. Fully prepared gelatine desserts are sold in a variety of forms, ranging from large decorative shapes to individual serving cups.\nIn the United States and Canada, this dessert is known by the genericised trademark \"jello\".\nHistory.\nBefore gelatine became widely available as a commercial product, the most typical gelatine dessert was \"calf's foot jelly\". As the name indicates, this was made by extracting and purifying gelatine from the foot of a calf. This gelatine was used for savoury dishes in aspic, or was mixed with fruit juice and sugar for a dessert.\nIn the eighteenth century, gelatine from calf's feet, isinglass and hartshorn was coloured blue with violet juice, yellow with saffron, red with cochineal and green with spinach and allowed to set in layers in small, narrow glasses. It was flavoured with sugar, lemon juice and mixed spices. This preparation was called \"jelly\"; the English cookery writer Hannah Glasse was the first to record the use of this jelly in trifle in her book \"The Art of Cookery\", first published in 1747. Preparations on making jelly (including illustrations) appear in the best selling cookbooks of the English writers Eliza Acton and Isabella Beeton in the 19th century.\nDue to the time-consuming nature of extracting gelatine from animal bones, gelatine desserts were a status symbol up until the mid-19th century as it indicated a large kitchen staff. Jelly molds were very common in the batteries de cuisine of stately homes.\nPreparation.\nTo make a gelatine dessert, gelatine is dissolved in hot liquid with the desired flavours and other additives. These latter ingredients usually include sugar, fruit juice, or sugar substitutes; they may be added and varied during preparation, or pre-mixed with the gelatine in a commercial product which mainly requires the addition of hot water.\nIn addition to sweeteners, the prepared commercial blends generally contain flavouring agents and other additives, such as adipic acid, fumaric acid, sodium citrate, and artificial flavourings and food colours. Because the collagen is processed extensively, the final product is not categorised as a meat or animal product by the United States federal government.\nPrepared commercial blends may be sold as a powder or as a concentrated gelatinous block, divided into small squares. Either type is mixed with sufficient hot water to completely dissolve it, and then mixed with enough cold water to make the volume of liquid specified on the packet.\nThe solubility of powdered gelatine can be enhanced by sprinkling it into the liquid several minutes before heating, \"blooming\" the individual granules. The fully dissolved mixture is then refrigerated, slowly forming a colloidal gel as it cools.\nGelatine desserts may be enhanced in many ways, such as using decorative moulds, creating multicoloured layers by adding a new layer of slightly cooled liquid over the previously solidified one, or suspending non-soluble edible elements such as marshmallows or fruit. Some types of fresh fruit and their unprocessed juices are incompatible with gelatine desserts; see the Chemistry section below.\nWhen fully chilled, the most common ratios of gelatine to liquid (as instructed on commercial packaging) usually result in a custard-like texture which can retain detailed shapes when cold but melts back to a viscous liquid when warm. A recipe calling for the addition of additional gelatine to regular jelly gives a rubbery product that can be cut into shapes with cookie cutters and eaten with fingers (called \"Knox Blox\" by the Knox company, makers of unflavoured gelatine). Higher gelatine ratios can be used to increase the stability of the gel, culminating in gummy candies which remain rubbery solids at room temperature (see Bloom (test)).\nThe bloom strength of a gelatine mixture is the measure of how strong it is. It is defined by the force in grams required to press a diameter plunger into of a standard 6.67% w/v gelatine gel at . The bloom strength of a gel is useful to know when determining the possibility of substituting a gelatine of one bloom strength for a gelatine of another. One can use the following equation:\nformula_1\nor\nformula_2\nwhere formula_3 is the concentration, formula_4 is the bloom strength, formula_5 is a constant. For example, when making gummies, it is important to know that a 250 bloom gelatine has a much shorter (more thick) texture than a 180 bloom gelatine.\nGelatine shots.\nA gelatine shot (usually called a Jell-O shot in North America and vodka jelly or jelly shot in the UK and Australia) is a shooter in which one or more liquors, usually vodka, rum, tequila, or neutral grain spirit, replaces some of the water or fruit juice that is used to congeal the gel.\nThe American satirist and mathematician Tom Lehrer claims to have invented the gelatine shot in the 1950s while working for the National Security Agency, where he developed vodka gelatine as a way to circumvent a restriction of alcoholic beverages on base. An early published recipe for an alcoholic gelatine drink dates from 1862, found in \"How to Mix Drinks, or The Bon Vivant's Companion\" by Jerry Thomas: his recipe for \"Punch Jelly\" calls for the addition of isinglass or other gelatine to a punch made from cognac, rum, and lemon juice.\nGelatine art desserts.\nGelatine art desserts, also known as 3D gelatine desserts, are made by injecting colourful shapes into a flavoured gelatine base. Creations by Lourdes Reyes Rosas of Mexico City kicked off the growth in popularity of this 3D gelation art technique in the early 1990s, which spread to Western and Pacific countries.\nThese desserts are made using high-quality gelatine that has a high bloom value and low odor and taste. The clear gelatine base is prepared using gelatine, water, sugar, citric acid and food flavouring.\nWhen the clear gelatine base sets, colourful shapes are injected using a syringe.\nThe injected material usually consists of a sweetener (most commonly sugar), some type of edible liquid (milk, cream, water, etc.), food colouring and a thickening agent such as starch or additional gelatin.\nThe shapes are drawn by making incisions in the clear gelatine base using sharp objects. Coloured liquid is then allowed to fill the crevice and make the cut shape visible.\nMost commonly, the shapes are drawn using sterile medical needles or specialised pre-cut gelatine art tools that allow the shape to be cut and filled with colour at the same time.\nGelatine art tools are attached to a syringe and used to inject a predetermined shape into gelatine.\nWhen combined with other ingredients, such as whipping cream or mousse, gelatine art desserts can be assembled into visually impressive formations resembling a cake.\nGelatine substitutes.\nOther culinary gelling agents can be used instead of animal-derived gelatine. These plant-derived substances are more similar to pectin and other gelling plant carbohydrates than to gelatine proteins; their physical properties are slightly different, creating different constraints for the preparation and storage conditions. These other gelling agents may also be preferred for certain traditional cuisines or dietary restrictions.\nAgar, a product made from red algae, is the traditional gelling agent in many Asian desserts. Agar is a popular gelatine substitute in quick jelly powder mix and prepared dessert gels that can be stored at room temperature. Compared to gelatine, agar preparations require a higher dissolving temperature, but the resulting gels congeal more quickly and remain solid at higher temperatures, , as opposed to for gelatine. Vegans and vegetarians can use agar to replace animal-derived gelatine.\nAnother common seaweed-based gelatine substitute is carrageenan, which has been used as a food additive since ancient times. It was first industrially-produced in the Philippines, which pioneered the cultivation of tropical red seaweed species (primarily \"Eucheuma\" and \"Kappaphycus\" spp.) from where carrageenan is extracted. The Philippines produces 80% of the world's carrageenan supply. Carrageenan gelatine substitute are traditionally known as gulaman in the Philippines. It is widely used in various traditional desserts and are sold as dried bars or in powder form. Unlike gelatine, gulaman sets at room temperature and is uniquely thermo-reversible. If melted at higher temperatures, it can revert to its original shape once cooled down. Carrageenan jelly also sets more firmly than agar and lacks agar's occasionally unpleasant smell during cooking. The use of carrageenan as a gelatine substitute has spread to other parts of the world, particularly in cuisines with dietary restrictions against gelatine, like kosher and halal cooking. It has also been used in prepackaged Jello shots to make them shelf stable at room temperatures.\nKonjac is a gelling agent used in many Asian foods, including the popular konnyaku fruit jelly candies.\nChemistry.\nGelatine consists of partially hydrolysed collagen, a protein which is highly abundant in animal tissues such as bone and skin. Collagen is a protein made up of three strands of polypeptide chains that form in a helical structure. To make a gelatine dessert, the collagen is mixed with water and heated, disrupting the bonds that hold the three strands of polypeptides together. As the gelatine cools, these bonds try to reform in the same structure as before, but now with small bubbles of liquid in between. This gives gelatine its semisolid, gel-like texture.\nBecause gelatine is a protein that contains both acid and base amino groups, it acts as an amphoteric molecule, displaying both acidic and basic properties. This allows it to react with different compounds, such as sugars and other food additives. These interactions give gelatine a versatile nature in the roles that it plays in different foods. It can stabilise foams in foods such as marshmallows, it can help to maintain small ice crystals in ice cream, and it can even serve as an emulsifier for foods like toffee and margarine.\nAlthough many gelatine desserts incorporate fruit, some fresh fruits contain proteolytic enzymes; these enzymes cut the gelatine molecule into peptides (protein fragments) too small to form a firm gel. The use of such fresh fruits in a gelatine recipe results in a dessert that never \"sets\".\nSpecifically, pineapple contains the protease (protein cutting enzyme) bromelain, kiwifruit contains actinidin, figs contain ficain, and papaya contains papain. Cooking or canning denatures and deactivates the proteases, so canned pineapple, for example, works fine in a gelatine dessert.\nLegal definitions and regulations.\nChina.\nGelatine dessert in China is defined as edible jelly-like food prepared from a mixture of water, sugar and gelling agent. The preparation processes include concocting, gelling, sterilising and packaging. In China, around 250 legal additives are allowed in gelatine desserts as gelling agents, colours, artificial sweeteners, emulsifiers and antioxidants.\nGelatine desserts are classified into 5 categories according to the different flavouring substances they contain. Five types of flavouring substance include artificial fruit flavoured type (less than 15% of natural fruit juice), natural fruit flavoured type (above 15% of natural fruit juice), natural flavoured with fruit pulp type and dairy type products, which includes dairy ingredients. The last type (\"others\") summarises gelatine desserts not mentioned above. It is typically sold in single-serving plastic cups or plastic food bags.\nSafety.\nAlthough eating tainted beef can lead to New Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (the human variant of mad-cow disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy), there is no known case of BSE having been transmitted through collagen products such as gelatine.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While the Ernestine line accepted Lutheranism, the Albertines, led by George, resisted religious change. Although he tried to prevent a Lutheran succession, the Act of Settlement of 1499 ensured that, after his death in 1539, Henry IV\u2014a Lutheran\u2014became duke and introduced Lutheranism as the official state religion of the Albertine territories.\nGeorge was also a knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece.\nLife.\nHis father was Albert the Brave of Saxony, founder of the Albertine line of the Wettin family, his mother was Sidonie, daughter of George of Pod\u011bbrady, King of Bohemia. Elector Frederick the Wise, a member of the Ernestine branch of the same family, known for his protection of Luther, was a cousin of Duke George.\nGeorge, as the eldest son, received an excellent training in theology and other branches of learning, and was thus much better educated than most of the princes of his day.\nAs early as 1488, when his father was in East Frisia fighting on behalf of the emperor, George was regent of the ducal possessions, which included the Margraviate of Meissen with the cities of Dresden and Leipzig.\nHe is buried with his wife Barbara in the purpose-built Georgskapelle in Meissen Cathedral. The room contains a magnificent altarpiece by Lucas Cranach the Elder. In 1677 a highly ornate ceiling was added to the chapel, designed by Wolf Caspar von Klengel.\nMarriage and children.\nGeorge was married at Dresden, on 21 November 1496, to Barbara Jagiellon, daughter of Casimir IV, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania and Elisabeth, daughter of Albrecht II of Hungary. They had ten children, but all, with the exception of a daughter, died before their father:\nDuke of Saxony.\nIn 1498, the emperor granted Albert the Brave the hereditary governorship of Friesland. At Maastricht, 14 February 1499, Albert settled the succession to his possessions, and endeavoured by this arrangement to prevent further partition of his domain. He died 12 September 1500, and was succeeded in his German territories by George as the head of the Albertine line, while George's brother Heinrich became hereditary governor of Friesland.\nThe Saxon occupation of Friesland, however, was by no means secure and was the source of constant revolts in that province. Consequently, Heinrich, who was of a rather inert disposition, relinquished his claims to the governorship, and in 1505 an agreement was made between the brothers by which Friesland was transferred to George, while Heinrich received an annuity and the districts of Freiberg and Wolkenstein. But this arrangement did not restore peace in Friesland, which remained a source of trouble to Saxony. In 1515 George sold Friesland to the future Emperor Charles V (then Duke of Burgundy) for the very moderate price of 100,000 florins. He tried to keep the newmade lands of het Bildt which weren't granted him by Charles V. These troubles outside of his Saxon possessions did not prevent George from bestowing much care on the government of the ducal territory proper. When regent, during the lifetime of his father, the difficulties arising from conflicting interests and the large demands on his powers had often brought the young prince to the verge of despair.\nIn a short time, however, he developed decided ability as a ruler; on entering upon his inheritance he divided the duchy into governmental districts, took measures to suppress the robber-knights, and regulated the judicial system by defining and readjusting the jurisdiction of the various law courts. In his desire to achieve good order, severity, and the amelioration of the condition of the people, he sometimes ventured to infringe even on the rights of the cities. His court was better regulated than that of any other German prince, and he bestowed a paternal care on the University of Leipzig, where a number of reforms were introduced, and Humanism, as opposed to Scholasticism, was encouraged.\nOpposition to the Reformation.\nFrom the beginning of the Reformation in 1517, Duke George directed his energies chiefly to ecclesiastical affairs. Hardly one of the secular German princes held as firmly as he to the Church, he defended its rights and vigorously condemned every innovation except those countenanced by the highest ecclesiastical authorities. At first he was not opposed to Luther, but as time went on and Luther's aim became clear to him, he turned more and more from the Reformer, and was finally, in consequence of this change of attitude, drawn into an acrimonious correspondence in which Luther, according to some without any justification, heavily criticized the duke.\nThe duke was not blind to the undeniable abuses existing at that time in the Church. In 1519, despite the opposition of the theological faculty of the university, he originated the Disputation of Leipzig, with the idea of helping forward the cause of truth, and was present at all the discussions. In 1521, at the Diet of Worms, when the German princes handed in a paper containing a list of \"grievances\" concerning the condition of the Church, George added for himself twelve specific complaints referring mainly to the abuse of Indulgences and the annates.\nIn 1525, he combined with his Lutheran son-in-law, Landgrave Philip of Hesse, and his cousin, the Elector Frederick the Wise, to suppress the revolt of the peasants, who were defeated near Frankenhausen in Thuringia. Some years later, he wrote a forcible preface to a translation of the New Testament issued at his command by his private secretary, Hieronymus Emser, as an offset to Luther's version. Lutheran books were confiscated by his order, wherever found, though he refunded the cost of the books. He proved himself in every way a vigorous opponent of the Lutherans, decreeing that Christian burial was to be refused to apostates, and recreant ecclesiastics were to be delivered to the bishop of Merseburg.\nFor those, however, who merely held anti-catholic opinions, the punishment was only expulsion from the duchy. The duke deeply regretted the constant postponement of the ardently desired council, from the action of which so much was expected. While awaiting its convocation, he thought to remove the more serious defects by a reform of the monasteries, which had become exceedingly worldly in spirit and from which many of the inmates were departing. He vainly sought to obtain from the Curia the right, which was sometimes granted by Rome, to make official visitations to the conventual institutions of his realm. His reforms were confined mainly to uniting the almost vacant monasteries and to matters of economic management, the control of the property being entrusted in most cases to the secular authorities.\nIn 1525, Duke George formed, with some other German rulers, the League of Dessau, for the protection of Catholic interests. In the same way he was the animating spirit of the League of Halle, formed in 1533, from which sprang in 1538 the Holy League of Nuremberg for the maintenance of the religious Peace of Nuremberg.\nThe vigorous activity displayed by the duke in so many directions was not attended with much success. Most of his political measures stood the test of experience, but in ecclesiastico-political matters he witnessed with sorrow the gradual decline of Catholicism and the spread of Lutheranism within his dominions, in spite of his earnest efforts and forcible prohibition of the new doctrine. Furthermore, during George's lifetime his nearest relations his son-in-law Philip of Hesse, and his brother Heinrich, joined the Reformers.\nHe spent the last years of his reign in endeavours to secure a Catholic successor, thinking by this step to check the dissemination of Lutheran opinions. The only one of George's sons then living was the weak-minded and unmarried Frederick. The intention of his father was that Frederick should rule with the aid of a council. Early in 1539, Frederick was married to Elizabeth of Mansfeld, but he died shortly afterwards, leaving no prospect of an heir. According to the act of settlement of 1499, George's Protestant brother Heinrich was now heir prospective; but George, disregarding his father's will, sought to disinherit his brother and to bequeath the duchy to Ferdinand, brother of Charles V. His sudden death prevented the carrying out of this intention.\nCharacter.\nGeorge was an industrious and energetic, if somewhat irascible ruler in the furtherance of the interests of his land and people. A faithful adherent of the Emperor and Empire, he accomplished much for his domain by economy, love of order and wise direction of activities of his state officials. The grief of his life was Luther's Reformation and what he regarded to be apostasy from the Old Faith. Of a strictly religious, although not narrow, disposition, he sought at any cost to keep his subjects from falling away from the Church, but his methods were sometimes questionable.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is formed by high-temperature and high-pressure metamorphic processes acting on formations composed of igneous or sedimentary rocks. This rock is formed under pressures ranging from 2 to 15 kbar, sometimes even more, and temperatures over 300\u00a0\u00b0C (572\u00a0\u00b0F). Gneiss nearly always shows a banded texture characterized by alternating darker and lighter colored bands and without a distinct cleavage.\nGneisses are common in the ancient crust of continental shields. Some of the oldest rocks on Earth are gneisses, such as the Acasta Gneiss.\nDescription.\nIn traditional English and North American usage, a gneiss is a coarse-grained metamorphic rock showing compositional banding (gneissic banding) but poorly developed schistosity and indistinct cleavage. In other words, it is a metamorphic rock composed of mineral grains easily seen with the unaided eye, which form obvious compositional layers, but which has only a weak tendency to fracture along these layers. In Europe, the term has been more widely applied to any coarse, mica-poor, high-grade metamorphic rock.\nThe British Geological Survey (BGS) and the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) both use \"gneiss\" as a broad textural category for medium- to coarse-grained metamorphic rock that shows poorly developed schistosity, with compositional layering over thick and tending to split into plates over thick. Neither definition depends on composition or origin, though rocks poor in platy minerals are more likely to produce gneissose texture. Gneissose rocks thus are largely recrystallized but do not carry large quantities of micas, chlorite or other platy minerals. Metamorphic rock showing stronger schistosity is classified as schist, while metamorphic rock devoid of schistosity is called a granofels.\nGneisses that are metamorphosed igneous rocks or their equivalent are termed granite gneisses, diorite gneisses, and so forth. Gneiss rocks may also be named after a characteristic component such as garnet gneiss, biotite gneiss, albite gneiss, and so forth. Orthogneiss designates a gneiss derived from an igneous rock, and paragneiss is one from a sedimentary rock.\nBoth the BGS and the IUGS use \"gneissose\" to describe rocks with the texture of gneiss, though \"gneissic\" also remains in common use. For example, a gneissose metagranite or a gneissic metagranite both mean a granite that has been metamorphosed and thereby acquired gneissose texture.\nGneissic banding.\nThe minerals in gneiss are arranged into layers that appear as bands in cross section. This is called gneissic banding. The darker bands have relatively more mafic minerals (those containing more magnesium and iron). The lighter bands contain relatively more felsic minerals (minerals such as feldspar or quartz, which contain more of the lighter elements, such as aluminium, sodium, and potassium).\nThe banding is developed at high temperature when the rock is more strongly compressed in one direction than in other directions (\"nonhydrostatic stress\"). The bands develop perpendicular to the direction of greatest compression, also called the shortening direction, as platy minerals are rotated or recrystallized into parallel layers.\nA common cause of nonhydrodynamic stress is the subjection of the protolith (the original rock material that undergoes metamorphism) to extreme shearing force, a sliding force similar to the pushing of the top of a deck of cards in one direction, and the bottom of the deck in the other direction. These forces stretch out the rock like a plastic, and the original material is spread out into sheets. Per the polar decomposition theorem, the deformation produced by such shearing force is equivalent to rotation of the rock combined with shortening in one direction and extension in another.\nSome banding is formed from original rock material (protolith) that is subjected to extreme temperature and pressure and is composed of alternating layers of sandstone (lighter) and shale (darker), which is metamorphosed into bands of quartzite and mica.\nAnother cause of banding is \"metamorphic differentiation\", which separates different materials into different layers through chemical reactions, a process not fully understood.\nAugen gneiss.\nAugen gneiss, from the , meaning \"eyes\", is a gneiss resulting from metamorphism of granite, which contains characteristic elliptic or lenticular shear-bound grains (porphyroclasts), normally feldspar, surrounded by finer grained material. The finer grained material deforms around the more resistant feldspar grains to produce this texture.\nMigmatite.\nMigmatite is a gneiss consisting of two or more distinct rock types, one of which has the appearance of an ordinary gneiss (the \"mesosome\"), and another of which has the appearance of an intrusive rock such as pegmatite, aplite, or granite (the \"leucosome\"). The rock may also contain a \"melanosome\" of mafic rock complementary to the leucosome. Migmatites are often interpreted as rock that has been partially melted, with the leucosome representing the silica-rich melt, the melanosome the residual solid rock left after partial melting, and the mesosome the original rock that has not yet experienced partial melting.\nOccurrences.\nGneisses are characteristic of areas of regional metamorphism that reaches the middle amphibolite to granulite metamorphic facies. In other words, the rock was metamorphosed at a temperature in excess of at pressures between about 2 to 24 kbar. Many different varieties of rock can be metamorphosed to gneiss, so geologists are careful to add descriptions of the color and mineral composition to the name of any gneiss, such as \"garnet-biotite paragneiss\" or \"grayish-pink orthogneiss\".\nGranite-greenstone belts.\nContinental shields are regions of exposed ancient rock that make up the stable cores of continents. The rock exposed in the oldest regions of shields, which is of Archean age (over 2500 million years old), mostly belong to granite-greenstone belts. The greenstone belts contain metavolcanic and metasedimentary rock that has undergone a relatively mild grade of metamorphism, at temperatures of and pressures of . The greenstone belts are surrounded by high-grade gneiss terrains showing highly deformed low-pressure, high-temperature (over ) metamorphism to the amphibolite or granulite facies. These form most of the exposed rock in Archean cratons.\nGneiss domes.\nGneiss domes are common in orogenic belts (regions of mountain formation). They consist of a dome of gneiss intruded by younger granite and migmatite and mantled with sedimentary rock. These have been interpreted as a geologic record of two distinct mountain-forming events, with the first producing the granite basement and the second deforming and melting this basement to produce the domes. However, some gneiss domes may actually be the cores of metamorphic core complexes, regions of the deep crust brought to the surface and exposed during extension of the Earth's crust.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"gneiss\" has been used in English since at least 1757. It is borrowed from the German word , formerly also spelled , which is probably derived from the Middle High German noun \"spark\" (so called because the rock glitters).\nUses.\nGneiss is used as a building material, such as the Facoidal gneiss. It's used extensively in Rio de Janeiro. Gneiss has also been used as construction aggregate for asphalt pavement.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is also known for having chaired the Brundtland Commission which presented the Brundtland Report on sustainable development.\nEducated as a physician, Brundtland joined the Labour Party and entered the government in 1974 as Minister of the Environment. She became the first female prime minister of Norway on 4 February 1981, but left office on 14 October 1981; she returned as prime minister on 9 May 1986 and served until 16 October 1989. She finally returned for her third term on 3 November 1990. After her surprise resignation as prime minister in 1996, she became an international leader in sustainable development and public health, and served as director-general of the World Health Organization and as UN special envoy on Climate Change from 2007 to 2010. She is also deputy chair of The Elders and a former vice-president of Socialist International.\nBrundtland belonged to the moderate wing of her party and supported Norwegian membership in the European Union during the 1994 referendum. As prime minister, Brundtland became widely known as the \"mother of the nation\". Brundtland received the 1994 Charlemagne Prize, and has received many other awards and recognitions.\nEarly life.\nBrundtland was born in Oslo in 1939, the daughter of physician and politician Gudmund Harlem and Inga Margareta Elisabet Brynolf (1918\u20132005). She has a younger brother, Lars and a younger sister, Hanne.\nIn 1963, Brundtland graduated with a medical degree, a cand.med. from the University of Oslo. She took her master's degree at Harvard University in 1965, as a Master of Public Health.\nFrom 1966 to 1969, she worked as a physician at the Directorate of Health (\"Helsedirektoratet\"), and from 1969 she worked as a doctor in Oslo's public school health service.\nPolitical career.\nShe was minister for environmental affairs from 1974 to 1979.\nPrime minister of Norway.\nBrundtland became Norway's first female prime minister in 1981. She served as prime minister from February to October.\nAt 41 years old she was the youngest person to become Prime Minister of Norway.\nBrundtland served as prime minister for two further, and more durable, terms. The second ministry was from 9 May 1986 until 16 October 1989 and this cabinet became known worldwide for its high proportion of female ministers: nearly half, or eight of the total eighteen ministers, were female. The third ministry was from 3 November 1990 to 25 October 1996.\nBrundtland became leader of the Labour Party in 1981 and held the office until resigning in 1992, during her third term as prime minister. In 1996, she resigned from office and retired completely from politics. Her successor as both Labour Party leader in 1992 and as prime minister in 1996 was Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland.\nLocal politics.\nBrundtland returned to politics when she became a candidate to the Oslo City Council for the 2023 local elections. She ultimately won a seat in the council.\nInternational career.\nIn 1983, Brundtland was invited by then United Nations Secretary-General Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar to establish and chair the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), widely referred to as the Brundtland Commission. She developed the broad political concept of sustainable development in the course of extensive public hearings, that were distinguished by their inclusiveness. The commission, which published its report, \"Our Common Future\", in April 1987, provided the momentum for the 1992 Earth Summit/UNCED, which was headed by Maurice Strong, who had been a prominent member of the commission. The Brundtland Commission also provided momentum for Agenda 21.\nDuring her third ministry, the Norwegian government in 1993 took the initiative to sponsor secret peace talks between the Government of Israel led by Yitzchak Rabin \u2013 like Brundtland, leader of a Labour Party \u2013 and the PLO led by Yasser Arafat. This culminated with the signing of the Oslo Accords. For several years afterwards, Norway continued to have a high-profile involvement in promoting Israeli-Palestinian peace, though increasingly displaced by the United States from its role as the mediator.\nAfter the end of her term as PM, Brundtland was then elected Director-General of the World Health Organization in May 1998. In this capacity, Brundtland adopted a far-reaching approach to public health, establishing a Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, chaired by Jeffrey Sachs, and addressing violence as a major public health issue. Brundtland spearheaded the movement, now worldwide, to achieve the abolition of cigarette smoking by education, persuasion, and increased taxation. Under her leadership, the World Health Organization was one of the first major employers to make quitting smoking a condition of employment.\nUnder Brundtland's leadership, the World Health Organization was criticized for increased drug-company influence on the agency.\nBrundtland was recognized in 2003 by \"Scientific American\" as their 'Policy Leader of the Year' for coordinating a rapid worldwide response to stem outbreaks of SARS. Brundtland was succeeded on 21 July 2003 by Jong-Wook Lee. In 1994, Brundtland was awarded the Charlemagne Prize of the city of Aachen.\nIn 2006 Brundtland was a member of the Panel of Eminent Persons who reviewed the work of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). In May 2007, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon named Brundtland, as well as Ricardo Lagos (the former president of Chile), and Han Seung-soo (the former foreign minister of South Korea), to serve as UN Special Envoys for Climate Change.\nBrundtland's hallmark political activities have been chronicled by her husband, Arne Olav Brundtland, in his two bestsellers, \"Married to Gro\" () and \"Still married to Gro\" ().\nIn 2007, Brundtland was working for Pepsi as a consultant.\nBrundtland is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an international network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilize collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.\nBrundtland is also a member of the Club of Madrid, an independent organization of former leaders of democratic states, which works to strengthen democratic governance and leadership.\nBrundtland is a founding member of The Elders, a group of world leaders originally convened by Nelson Mandela, Gra\u00e7a Machel and Desmond Tutu in order to tackle some of the world's toughest problems. Mandela announced the launch of the group on 18 July 2007 in Johannesburg, South Africa. Brundtland has been active in The Elders' work, participating in a broad range of the group's initiatives. She has travelled with Elders delegations to Cyprus, the Korean Peninsula, Ethiopia, India and the Middle East. Brundtland has also been involved in The Elders' initiative on child marriage, including the founding of \"Girls Not Brides: The Global Partnership to End Child Marriage\". She was appointed Deputy Chair of the group in 2013 and was succeeded in this role by Ban Ki-moon and Gra\u00e7a Machel in 2018.\nBrundtland attended the Bilderberg meetings in 1982 and 1983. Her husband attended in 1991.\nIn 2019, Brundtland served as co-chair with the WHO Global Preparedness Monitoring Board.\nAssassination attempt.\nBrundtland narrowly escaped assassination by Anders Behring Breivik on 22 July 2011. She had been on the island of Ut\u00f8ya hours before the massacre there to give a speech to the AUF camp; Breivik stated that he originally intended Brundtland to be the main target of the attack (along with Eskil Pedersen and Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re), but he had been delayed while travelling from Oslo. Breivik arrived on Ut\u00f8ya about two hours after Brundtland had left.\nDuring his trial in 2012, Breivik revealed detailed assassination plans for Brundtland. He told the court that he had planned to handcuff her and then record himself reading out a prepared text detailing her \"crimes\", before decapitating her on camera using a bayonet and uploading the footage to the internet. Breivik said that while Brundtland had been his main target, he had still planned to massacre everyone else on the island.\nPersonal life.\nShe married Arne Olav Brundtland on 9 December 1960. They had four children; one is deceased. They own a house in the south of France.\nHealth issues.\nBrundtland was operated on for uterine cancer in 2002 at Oslo University Hospital, Ullev\u00e5l. In 2008 it became known that during 2007 she had received two treatments at Ullev\u00e5l, paid for by Norwegian public expenditures. Since she had previously notified the Norwegian authorities that she had changed residence to France, she was no longer entitled to Norwegian social security benefits. Following media attention surrounding the matter, Brundtland decided to change residence once more, back to Norway, and she also announced that she would be paying for the treatments herself. Brundtland has claimed to suffer from electrical sensitivity which causes headaches when someone uses a mobile phone near her.\nHonours.\nBrundtland has received many awards and honours, including\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was considered the patron saint of Kotromani\u0107 dynasty and medieval Bosnia during the first half of the 15th century, while Saint George, the miracle-worker, has been the patron saint since at least mid-13th century, although confirmed by the papacy much later in 1461. Saint Gregory the Great was also considered the patron of both the state and dynasty in the late 15th century.\nHe is also one of only three men in the life of the Orthodox Church who have been officially designated \"Theologian\" by epithet, the other two being John the Apostle, and Symeon the New Theologian.\nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nGregory was born to Greek parents in the family estate of Karbala outside the village of Arianzus, near Nazianzus, in southwest Cappadocia. His parents, Gregory of Nazianzus the Elder and Nonna of Nazianzus, were wealthy land-owners. In 325, Nonna converted her husband, a Hypsistarian, to Christianity; he was subsequently ordained as bishop of Nazianzus in 328 or 329. The young Gregory and his brother, Caesarius of Nazianzus, first studied at home with their uncle Amphylokhios. Gregory went on to study advanced rhetoric and philosophy in Nazianzus, Caesarea, Alexandria, and Athens. On the way to Athens, his ship encountered a violent storm, and the terrified Gregory prayed to Christ that if He would deliver him, he would dedicate his life to His service. While at Athens, he developed a close friendship with his fellow student Basil of Caesarea, and also made the acquaintance of Flavius Claudius Julianus, who would later become the Roman emperor known as Julian. In Athens, Gregory studied under the famous rhetoricians Himerius and Proaeresius. He may have been baptized there, or shortly after his return to Cappadocia.\nPriesthood.\nIn 361, Gregory returned to Nazianzus and was ordained a presbyter by his father's wish, who wanted him to assist with caring for local Christians. The younger Gregory, who had been considering a monastic existence, resented his father's decision to force him to choose between priestly services and a solitary existence, calling it an \"act of tyranny\". Leaving home after a few days, he met his friend Basil at Annesoi, where the two lived as ascetics. However, Basil urged him to return home to assist his father, which he did for the next year. Arriving at Nazianzus, Gregory found the local Christian community split by theological differences and his father accused of heresy by local monks. Gregory helped to heal the division through a combination of personal diplomacy and oratory.\nBy this time, Emperor Julian had publicly declared himself in opposition to Christianity. In response to the emperor's rejection of the Christian faith, Gregory composed his \"Invectives Against Julian\" between 362 and 363. \"Invectives\" asserts that Christianity will overcome imperfect rulers such as Julian through love and patience. This process as described by Gregory is the public manifestation of the process of deification (\"theosis\"), which leads to a spiritual elevation and mystical union with God. Julian resolved, in late 362, to vigorously prosecute Gregory and his other Christian critics; however, the emperor perished the following year during a campaign against the Persians. With the death of the emperor, Gregory and the Eastern churches were no longer under the threat of persecution, as the new Roman emperor Jovian was an avowed Christian and supporter of the church.\nGregory spent the next few years combating Arianism, which threatened to divide the region of Cappadocia. In this tense environment, Gregory interceded on behalf of his friend Basil with Bishop Eusebius (Mazaca). The two friends then entered a period of close fraternal cooperation as they participated in a great rhetorical contest of the Caesarean church precipitated by the arrival of accomplished Arian theologians and rhetors. In the subsequent public debates, presided over by agents of the Emperor Valens, Gregory and Basil emerged triumphant. This success confirmed for both Gregory and Basil that their futures lay in administration of the Church. Basil, who had long displayed inclinations to the episcopacy, was elected bishop of the see of Caesarea in Cappadocia in 370.\nEpiscopate in Sasima and Nazianzus.\nGregory was ordained Bishop of Sasima in 372 by Basil. Basil created this see in order to strengthen his position in his dispute with Anthimus, bishop of Tyana. The ambitions of Gregory's father to have his son rise in the Church hierarchy and the insistence of his friend Basil convinced Gregory to accept this position despite his reservations. Gregory would later refer to his episcopal ordination as forced upon him by his strong-willed father and Basil. Describing his new bishopric, Gregory lamented how it was nothing more than an \"utterly dreadful, pokey little hole; a paltry horse-stop on the main road... devoid of water, vegetation, or the company of gentlemen... this was my Church of Sasima!\" He made little effort to administer his new diocese, complaining to Basil that he preferred instead to pursue a contemplative life.\nBy late 372, Gregory returned to Nazianzus to assist his dying father with the administration of his diocese. This strained his relationship with Basil, who insisted that Gregory resume his post at Sasima. Gregory retorted that he had no intention to continue to play the role of pawn to advance Basil's interests. He instead focused his attention on his new duties as coadjutor of Nazianzus.\nIt was around this time that his sister, Saint Gorgonia, died, and he preached a eulogy at her funeral.\nFollowing the deaths of his mother and father in 374, Gregory continued to administer the Diocese of Nazianzus but refused to be named bishop. Donating most of his inheritance to the needy, he lived an austere existence. At the end of 375, he withdrew to a monastery at Seleukia, living there for three years. Near the end of this period, his friend Basil died. Although Gregory's health did not permit him to attend the funeral, he wrote a heartfelt letter of condolence to Basil's brother, Gregory of Nyssa, and composed twelve memorial poems dedicated to the memory of his departed friend. (The Greek Anthology, book I epigram 86 and book VIII epigrams 2\u201311).\nGregory at Constantinople.\nUpon the death of Emperor Valens in 378, the accession of Theodosius I, a steadfast supporter of Nicene orthodoxy, was good news to those who wished to purge Constantinople of Arian and Apollinarian domination. The exiled Nicene party gradually returned to the city. From his deathbed, Basil reminded them of Gregory's capabilities and likely recommended his friend to champion the Trinitarian cause in Constantinople.\nIn 379, the Antioch synod and its archbishop, Meletius, asked Gregory to go to Constantinople to lead a theological campaign to win over that city to Nicene orthodoxy. After much hesitation, Gregory agreed. His cousin Theodosia offered him a villa for his residence; Gregory immediately transformed much of it into a church, naming it Anastasia, \"a scene for the resurrection of the faith\". From this little chapel he delivered five powerful discourses on Nicene doctrine, explaining the nature of the Trinity and the unity of the Godhead. Refuting the Eunomian denial of the Holy Spirit's divinity, Gregory offered this argument:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Look at these facts: Christ is born, the Holy Spirit is His Forerunner. Christ is baptized, the Spirit bears witness to this ... Christ works miracles, the Spirit accompanies them. Christ ascends, the Spirit takes His place. What great things are there in the idea of God which are not in His power? What titles appertaining to God do not apply also to Him, except for Unbegotten and Begotten? I tremble when I think of such an abundance of titles, and how many Names they blaspheme, those who revolt against the Spirit!\nGregory's homilies were well received and attracted ever-growing crowds to Anastasia. Fearing his popularity, his opponents decided to strike. On the vigil of Easter in 379, an Arian mob burst into his church during worship services, wounding Gregory and killing another bishop. Escaping the mob, Gregory next found himself betrayed by his erstwhile friend, the philosopher Maximus I of Constantinople. Maximus I, who was in secret alliance with Peter II of Alexandria, attempted to seize Gregory's position and have himself ordained bishop of Constantinople. Shocked, Gregory decided to resign his office, but the faction faithful to him induced him to stay and ejected Maximus I. This episode left Gregory embarrassed, and exposed him to criticism as a provincial simpleton unable to cope with the intrigues of the imperial city.\nAffairs in Constantinople remained confused as Gregory's position was still unofficial, and Arian priests yet occupied many important churches. The arrival of the emperor Theodosius in 380 settled matters in Gregory's favor. The emperor, determined to eliminate Arianism, expelled Demophilus of Constantinople. Gregory was subsequently enthroned as bishop of Constantinople at the Basilica of the Apostles, replacing Demophilus.\nSecond Ecumenical Council and retirement to Nazianzus.\nTheodosius wanted to further unify the entire empire behind the orthodox position and decided to convene a church council to resolve matters of faith and discipline. Gregory was of similar mind in wishing to unify Christianity. In the spring of 381, they convened the First Council of Constantinople, which was attended by 150 Eastern bishops. After the death of the presiding bishop, Meletius of Antioch, Gregory was selected to lead the council. Hoping to reconcile the West with the East, he offered to recognize Paulinus II as Patriarch of Antioch. The Egyptian and Macedonian bishops who had supported Maximus's ordination arrived late for the council. Once there, they refused to recognise Gregory's position as head of the church of Constantinople, arguing that his transfer from the See of Sasima was canonically illegitimate.\nGregory was physically exhausted and worried that he was losing the confidence of the bishops and the emperor. Rather than press his case and risk further division, he decided to resign his office: \"Let me be as the Prophet Jonah! I was responsible for the storm, but I would sacrifice myself for the salvation of the ship. Seize me and throw me ... I was not happy when I ascended the throne, and gladly would I descend it\". He shocked the council with his surprise resignation and then delivered a dramatic speech to Theodosius asking to be released from his offices. The emperor, moved by his words, applauded, commended his labor, and granted his resignation. The Council asked him to appear once more for a farewell ritual and celebratory orations. Gregory used this occasion to deliver a final address (Or. 42) and then departed.\nReturning to his homeland of Cappadocia, Gregory once again resumed his position as bishop of Nazianzus. He spent the next year combating the local Apollinarian heretics and struggling with periodic illness. He also began composing \"De Vita Sua\", his autobiographical poem. By the end of 383 he found his health too feeble to cope with episcopal duties. Gregory established Eulalius as bishop of Nazianzus and then withdrew into the solitude of Arianzus. After enjoying six peaceful years in retirement at his family estate, he died on 25 January 390.\nGregory faced stark choices throughout his life: Should he pursue studies as a rhetor or philosopher? Would a monastic life be more appropriate than public ministry? Was it better to blaze his own path or follow the course mapped for him by his father and Basil? Gregory's writings illuminate the conflicts which both tormented and motivated him. Biographers suggest that it was this dialectic which defined him, forged his character, and inspired his search for meaning and truth.\nLegacy.\nTheological and other works.\nGregory's most significant theological contributions arose from his defense of the doctrine of the Trinity. He is especially noted for his contributions to the field of pneumatology \u2014 that is, theology concerning the nature of the Holy Spirit. In this regard, Gregory is the first to use the idea of \"procession\" to describe the relationship between the Spirit and the Godhead: \"The Holy Spirit is truly Spirit, coming forth from the Father indeed but not after the manner of the Son, for it is not by generation but by \"procession\", since I must coin a word for the sake of clearness.\" Although Gregory does not fully develop the concept, the idea of procession would shape most later thought about the Holy Spirit.\nHe emphasized that Jesus did not cease to be God when he became a man, nor did he lose any of his divine attributes when he took on human nature. Furthermore, Gregory asserted that Christ was fully human, including a full human soul. He also proclaimed the eternality of the Holy Spirit, saying that the Holy Spirit's actions were somewhat hidden in the Old Testament but much clearer since the ascension of Jesus into Heaven and the descent of the Holy Spirit at the feast of Pentecost.\nIn contrast to the Neo-Arian belief that the Son is \"anomoios\", or \"unlike\" the Father, and with the Semi-Arian assertion that the Son is , or \"like\" the Father, Gregory and his fellow Cappadocians maintained the Nicaean doctrine of , or consubstantiality of the Son with the Father. The Cappadocian Fathers asserted that God's nature is unknowable to man; helped to develop the framework of , or three persons united in a single Godhead; illustrated how Jesus is the of the Father; and explained the concept of , the belief that all Christians can be assimilated with God in \"imitation of the incarnate Son as the divine model\".\nSome of Gregory's theological writings suggest that, like his friend Gregory of Nyssa, he may have supported some form of the doctrine of Apokatastasis, the belief that God will bring all of creation into harmony with the Kingdom of Heaven. This led Philip Schaff and late-nineteenth century Christian universalists such as John Wesley Hanson to describe Gregory's theology as universalist. This view of Gregory is also held by some modern theologians such as John Sachs, who said that Gregory had \"leanings\" toward apokatastasis, but in a \"cautious, undogmatic\" way. However, it is not clear or universally accepted that Gregory held to the doctrine of Apokatastasis.\nApart from the several theological discourses, Gregory was also one of the most important early Christian men of letters, a very accomplished orator, even perhaps one of the greatest of his time. Gregory was also a very prolific poet who wrote theological, moral, and biographical poems. The book VIII of the \"Greek Anthology\" contains exclusively 254 epigrams of his.\nInfluence.\nGregory's great nephew Nichobulos served as his literary executor, preserving and editing many of his writings. A cousin, Eulalios, published several of Gregory's more noteworthy works in 391. By 400, Rufinius began translating his orations into Latin. As Gregory's works circulated throughout the empire they influenced theological thought. His orations were cited as authoritative by the Council of Ephesus in 431. By 451 he was designated \"Theologus\", or \"Theologian\" by the Council of Chalcedon \u2013 a title held by no others save John the Apostle and Symeon the New Theologian (949\u20131022). He is widely quoted by Eastern Orthodox theologians and highly regarded as a defender of the Christian faith. His contributions to Trinitarian theology are also influential and often cited in the Western churches. Paul Tillich credits Gregory of Nazianzus for having \"created the definitive formulae for the doctrine of the trinity\". Additionally, the Liturgy of Saint Gregory the Theologian in use by the Coptic Church is named after him.\nRelics.\nFollowing his death, Gregory was buried at Nazianzus. His relics, consisting of portions of his body and clothing, were transferred to Constantinople in 950, into the Church of the Holy Apostles. Part of the relics were taken from Constantinople by Crusaders during the Fourth Crusade, in 1204, and ended up in Rome. On 27 November 2004, those relics, along with those of John Chrysostom, were returned to Istanbul by Pope John Paul II, with the Vatican retaining a small portion of both. The relics are now enshrined in the Patriarchal St. George's Cathedral, Istanbul in the Fanar.\nDeath.\nDuring the six years of life which remained to him after his final retirement to his birthplace, Gregory composed the greater part of his copious poetical works. These include a valuable autobiographical poem of nearly 2000 lines; about one hundred other shorter poems relating to his past career; and a large number of epitaphs, epigrams, and epistles to well-known people during that era. The poems that he wrote that dealt with his personal affairs refer to the continuous illness and severe sufferings (physical and spiritual) which assailed him during his last years. In the tiny plot of ground at Arianzus, all that remained to him of his rich inheritance was by a fountain near which there was a shady walk. Gregory retired here to spend his days as a hermit. It was during this time that he decided to write theological discourses and poetry of both a religious and an autobiographical nature. He would receive occasional visits from intimate friends, as well as visits from strangers who were attracted to his retreat by his large reputation for sanctity and learning. He died about 25 January 390, although the exact date of his death is unknown.\nFeast days.\nGregory of Nazianzus is celebrated on different days across Christianity:\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.\nWeb browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.\nHTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by \"tags\", written using angle brackets. Tags such as and directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as and surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.\nHTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[ [update]] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the element, together with JavaScript.\nHistory.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed \"some of the many areas in which hypertext is used\"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.\nThe first publicly available description of HTML was a document called \"HTML Tags\", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by CERN SGML, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.\nHTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 \"Techniques for using SGML\", which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.\nBerners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the \"Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)\" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the syntax. The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft, \"HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)\", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.\nAfter the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group completed \"HTML 2.0\", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.\nFurther development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996,[ [update]] the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). In 2000, HTML became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.\n; November 24, 1995: HTML 2.0 was published as . Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:\n* November 25, 1995: (form-based file upload)\n* May 1996: (tables)\n* August 1996: (client-side image maps)\n* January 1997: (internationalization)\n; January 14, 1997: HTML 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.\n Initially code-named \"Wilbur\", HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies. A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in MathML.\n; December 18, 1997: HTML 4.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:\n* Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden\n* Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed\n* Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.\nInitially code-named \"Cougar\", HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but also sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879\u00a0\u2013 SGML.\n;April 24, 1998\n HTML 4.0 was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.\n; December 24, 1999: HTML 4.01 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata were published on May 12, 2001.\n; May 2000: ISO/IEC 15445:2000 (\"ISO HTML\", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO, this standard is in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34\u00a0\u2013 Document description and processing languages).\n After HTML 4.01, there were no new versions of HTML for many years, as the development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group.\n; October 28, 2014 : HTML5 was published as a W3C Recommendation.\n; November 1, 2016 : HTML 5.1 was published as a W3C Recommendation.\n; December 14, 2017 : HTML 5.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation.\nHTML draft version timeline.\nXHTML versions.\nXHTML is a separate language that began as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 using XML 1.0. It is now referred to as \"the XML syntax for HTML\" and is no longer being developed as a separate standard.\nTransition of HTML publication to WHATWG.\nOn 28 May 2019, the W3C announced that WHATWG would be the sole publisher of the HTML and DOM standards. The W3C and WHATWG had been publishing competing standards since 2012. While the W3C standard was identical to the WHATWG in 2007 the standards have since progressively diverged due to different design decisions. The WHATWG \"Living Standard\" had been the \"de facto\" web standard for some time.\nMarkup.\nHTML markup consists of several key components, including those called \"tags\" (and their \"attributes\"), character-based \"data types\", \"character references\" and \"entity references\". HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like and , although some represent \"empty elements\" and so are unpaired, for example . The first tag in such a pair is the \"start tag\", and the second is the \"end tag\" (they are also called \"opening tags\" and \"closing tags\").\nAnother important component is the HTML \"document type declaration\", which triggers standards mode rendering.\nThe following is an example of the classic \"Hello, World!\" program:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n &lt;head&gt;\n &lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;\n &lt;/head&gt;\n &lt;body&gt;\n &lt;div&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\nThe text between and describes the web page, and the text between and is the visible page content. The markup text defines the browser page title shown on browser tabs and window titles and the tag defines a division of the page used for easy styling. Between and , a element can be used to define webpage metadata.\nThe Document Type Declaration is for HTML5. If a declaration is not included, various browsers will revert to \"quirks mode\" for rendering.\nElements.\nHTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML \"tags\", enclosed in angle brackets.\nIn the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a \"start tag\" and \"end tag\" . The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.\nTags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.\nThe start tag may also include the element's \"attributes\" within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the used to embed images, the reference to the image resource in the format like this: \nSome elements, such as the line break do not permit \"any\" embedded content, either text or further tags. These require only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag.\nMany tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly used paragraph element , are optional. An HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context and the structural rules defined by the HTML standard. These rules are complex and not widely understood by most HTML authors.\nThe general form of an HTML element is therefore: . Some HTML elements are defined as \"empty elements\" and take the form . Empty elements may enclose no content, for instance, the tag or the inline tag.\nThe name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags.\nThe end tag's name is preceded by a slash character codice_1. If a tag has no content, an end tag is not allowed. If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case.\nElement examples.\nHeader of the HTML document: . The title is included in the head, for example:\n&lt;head&gt;\n &lt;title&gt;The Title&lt;/title&gt;\n &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"stylebyjimbowales.css\"&gt; &lt;!-- Imports Stylesheets --&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\nHeadings.\nHTML headings are defined with the to tags with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least:\n&lt;h1&gt;Heading level 1&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Heading level 2&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Heading level 3&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Heading level 4&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;h5&gt;Heading level 5&lt;/h5&gt;\n&lt;h6&gt;Heading level 6&lt;/h6&gt;\nThe effects are:\nHeading Level 1\nHeading Level 2\nHeading Level 3\nHeading Level 4\nHeading Level 5\nHeading Level 6\nCSS can substantially change the rendering.\nParagraphs:&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 1&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paragraph 2&lt;/p&gt;\nLine breaks.\n. The difference between and is that breaks a line without altering the semantic structure of the page, whereas sections the page into paragraphs. The element is an \"empty element\" in that, although it may have attributes, it can take no content and it must not have an end tag.\n&lt;p&gt;This &lt;br&gt; is a paragraph &lt;br&gt; with &lt;br&gt; line breaks&lt;/p&gt;\nLinks.\nThis is a link in HTML. To create a link the tag is used. The codice_2 attribute holds the URL address of the link.\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org/\"&gt;A link to Wikipedia!&lt;/a&gt;\nInputs.\nThere are many possible ways a user can give inputs like:\n&lt;input type=\"text\"&gt; &lt;!-- This is for text input --&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"file\"&gt; &lt;!-- This is for uploading files --&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\"&gt; &lt;!-- This is for checkboxes --&gt;\nComments:\n&lt;!-- This is a comment --&gt; Comments can help in the understanding of the markup and do not display in the webpage.\nThere are several types of markup elements used in HTML:\nAttributes.\nMost of the attributes of an element are name\u2013value pairs, separated by codice_8 and written within the start tag of an element after the element's name. The value may be enclosed in single or double quotes, although values consisting of certain characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not XHTML). Leaving attribute values unquoted is considered unsafe. In contrast with name-value pair attributes, there are some attributes that affect the element simply by their presence in the start tag of the element, like the codice_9 attribute for the codice_4 element.\nThere are several common attributes that may appear in many elements:\nThe abbreviation element, codice_21, can be used to demonstrate some of these attributes:\n&lt;abbr id=\"anId\" class=\"jargon\" style=\"color:purple;\" title=\"Hypertext Markup Language\"&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt;\nThis example displays as HTML; in most browsers, pointing the cursor at the abbreviation should display the title text \"Hypertext Markup Language.\"\nMost elements take the language-related attribute codice_22 to specify text direction, such as with \"rtl\" for right-to-left text in, for example, Arabic, Persian or Hebrew.\nCharacter and entity references.\nAs of version 4.0, HTML defines a set of 252 character entity references and a set of 1,114,050 numeric character references, both of which allow individual characters to be written via simple markup, rather than literally. A literal character and its markup counterpart are considered equivalent and are rendered identically.\nThe ability to \"escape\" characters in this way allows for the characters codice_23 and codice_24 (when written as codice_25 and codice_26, respectively) to be interpreted as character data, rather than markup. For example, a literal codice_23 normally indicates the start of a tag, and codice_24 normally indicates the start of a character entity reference or numeric character reference; writing it as codice_26 or codice_30 or codice_31 allows codice_24 to be included in the content of an element or in the value of an attribute. The double-quote character (codice_33), when not used to quote an attribute value, must also be escaped as codice_34 or codice_35 or codice_36 when it appears within the attribute value itself. Equivalently, the single-quote character (codice_37), when not used to quote an attribute value, must also be escaped as codice_38 or codice_39 (or as codice_40 in HTML5 or XHTML documents) when it appears within the attribute value itself. If document authors overlook the need to escape such characters, some browsers can be very forgiving and try to use context to guess their intent. The result is still invalid markup, which makes the document less accessible to other browsers and to other user agents that may try to parse the document for search and indexing purposes for example.\nEscaping also allows for characters that are not easily typed, or that are not available in the document's character encoding, to be represented within the element and attribute content. For example, the acute-accented codice_41 (codice_42), a character typically found only on Western European and South American keyboards, can be written in any HTML document as the entity reference codice_43 or as the numeric references codice_44 or codice_45, using characters that are available on all keyboards and are supported in all character encodings. Unicode character encodings such as UTF-8 are compatible with all modern browsers and allow direct access to almost all the characters of the world's writing systems.\nData types.\nHTML defines several data types for element content, such as script data and stylesheet data, and a plethora of types for attribute values, including IDs, names, URIs, numbers, units of length, languages, media descriptors, colors, character encodings, dates and times, and so on. All of these data types are specializations of character data.\nDocument type declaration.\nHTML documents are required to start with a document type declaration (informally, a \"doctype\"). In browsers, the doctype helps to define the rendering mode\u2014particularly whether to use quirks mode.\nThe original purpose of the doctype was to enable the parsing and validation of HTML documents by SGML tools based on the document type definition (DTD). The DTD to which the DOCTYPE refers contains a machine-readable grammar specifying the permitted and prohibited content for a document conforming to such a DTD. Browsers, on the other hand, do not implement HTML as an application of SGML and as consequence do not read the DTD.\nHTML5 does not define a DTD; therefore, in HTML5 the doctype declaration is simpler and shorter:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\nAn example of an HTML 4 doctype\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\" \"https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd\"&gt;\nThis declaration references the DTD for the \"strict\" version of HTML 4.01. SGML-based validators read the DTD in order to properly parse the document and to perform validation. In modern browsers, a valid doctype activates standards mode as opposed to quirks mode.\nIn addition, HTML 4.01 provides Transitional and Frameset DTDs, as explained below. The transitional type is the most inclusive, incorporating current tags as well as older or \"deprecated\" tags, with the Strict DTD excluding deprecated tags. The frameset has all tags necessary to make frames on a page along with the tags included in transitional type.\nSemantic HTML.\nSemantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded information over its presentation (look). HTML has included semantic markup from its inception, but has also included presentational markup, such as , and tags. There are also the semantically neutral div and span tags. Since the late 1990s, when Cascading Style Sheets were beginning to work in most browsers, web authors have been encouraged to avoid the use of presentational HTML markup with a view to the separation of content and presentation.\nIn a 2001 discussion of the Semantic Web, Tim Berners-Lee and others gave examples of ways in which intelligent software \"agents\" may one day automatically crawl the web and find, filter, and correlate previously unrelated, published facts for the benefit of human users. Such agents are not commonplace even now, but some of the ideas of Web 2.0, mashups and price comparison websites may be coming close. The main difference between these web application hybrids and Berners-Lee's semantic agents lies in the fact that the current aggregation and hybridization of information is usually designed by web developers, who already know the web locations and the API semantics of the specific data they wish to mash, compare and combine.\nAn important type of web agent that does crawl and read web pages automatically, without prior knowledge of what it might find, is the web crawler or search-engine spider. These software agents are dependent on the semantic clarity of web pages they find as they use various techniques and algorithms to read and index millions of web pages a day and provide web users with search facilities without which the World Wide Web's usefulness would be greatly reduced.\nIn order for search engine spiders to be able to rate the significance of pieces of text they find in HTML documents, and also for those creating mashups and other hybrids as well as for more automated agents as they are developed, the semantic structures that exist in HTML need to be widely and uniformly applied to bring out the meaning of the published text.\nPresentational markup tags are deprecated in current HTML and XHTML recommendations. The majority of presentational features from previous versions of HTML are no longer allowed as they lead to poorer accessibility, higher cost of site maintenance, and larger document sizes.\nGood semantic HTML also improves the accessibility of web documents (see also Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). For example, when a screen reader or audio browser can correctly ascertain the structure of a document, it will not waste the visually impaired user's time by reading out repeated or irrelevant information when it has been marked up correctly.\nDelivery.\nHTML documents can be delivered by the same means as any other computer file. However, they are most often delivered either by HTTP from a web server or by email.\nHTTP.\nThe World Wide Web is composed primarily of HTML documents transmitted from web servers to web browsers using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). However, HTTP is used to serve images, sound, and other content, in addition to HTML. To allow the web browser to know how to handle each document it receives, other information is transmitted along with the document. This meta data usually includes the MIME type (e.g., text/html or application/xhtml+xml) and the character encoding (see Character encodings in HTML).\nIn modern browsers, the MIME type that is sent with the HTML document may affect how the document is initially interpreted. A document sent with the XHTML MIME type is expected to be well-formed XML; syntax errors may cause the browser to fail to render it. The same document sent with the HTML MIME type might be displayed successfully since some browsers are more lenient with HTML.\nThe W3C recommendations state that XHTML 1.0 documents that follow guidelines set forth in the recommendation's Appendix C may be labeled with either MIME Type. XHTML 1.1 also states that XHTML 1.1 documents should be labeled with either MIME type.\nHTML e-mail.\nMost graphical email clients allow the use of a subset of HTML (often ill-defined) to provide formatting and semantic markup not available with plain text. This may include typographic information like colored headings, emphasized and quoted text, inline images and diagrams. Many such clients include both a GUI editor for composing HTML e-mail messages and a rendering engine for displaying them. Use of HTML in e-mail is criticized by some because of compatibility issues, because it can help disguise phishing attacks, because of accessibility issues for blind or visually impaired people, because it can confuse spam filters and because the message size is larger than plain text.\nNaming conventions.\nThe most common filename extension for files containing HTML is .html. A common abbreviation of this is .htm, which originated because some operating systems limit file extensions to three letters.\nHTML Application.\nAn HTML Application (HTA; file extension .hta) is a Microsoft Windows application that uses HTML and Dynamic HTML in a browser to provide the application's graphical interface. A regular HTML file is confined to the security model of the web browser's security, communicating only to web servers and manipulating only web page objects and site cookies. An HTA runs as a fully trusted application and therefore has more privileges, like creation/editing/removal of files and Windows Registry entries. Because they operate outside the browser's security model, HTAs cannot be executed via HTTP, but must be downloaded (just like an EXE file) and executed from local file system.\nHTML4 variations.\nSince its inception, HTML and its associated protocols gained acceptance relatively quickly. However, no clear standards existed in the early years of the language. Though its creators originally conceived of HTML as a semantic language devoid of presentation details, practical uses pushed many presentational elements and attributes into the language, driven largely by the various browser vendors. The latest standards surrounding HTML reflect efforts to overcome the sometimes chaotic development of the language and to create a rational foundation for building both meaningful and well-presented documents. To return HTML to its role as a semantic language, the W3C has developed style languages such as CSS and XSL to shoulder the burden of presentation. In conjunction, the HTML specification has slowly reined in the presentational elements.\nThere are two axes differentiating various variations of HTML as currently specified: SGML-based HTML versus XML-based HTML (referred to as XHTML) on one axis, and strict versus transitional (loose) versus frameset on the other axis.\nSGML-based versus XML-based HTML.\nOne difference in the latest HTML specifications lies in the distinction between the SGML-based specification and the XML-based specification. The XML-based specification is usually called XHTML to distinguish it clearly from the more traditional definition. However, the root element name continues to be \"html\" even in the XHTML-specified HTML. The W3C intended XHTML 1.0 to be identical to HTML 4.01 except where limitations of XML over the more complex SGML require workarounds. Because XHTML and HTML are closely related, they are sometimes documented in parallel. In such circumstances, some authors conflate the two names as (X)HTML or X(HTML).\nLike HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0 has three sub-specifications: strict, transitional, and frameset.\nAside from the different opening declarations for a document, the differences between an HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 document\u2014in each of the corresponding DTDs\u2014are largely syntactic. The underlying syntax of HTML allows many shortcuts that XHTML does not, such as elements with optional opening or closing tags, and even empty elements which must not have an end tag. By contrast, XHTML requires all elements to have an opening tag and a closing tag. XHTML, however, also introduces a new shortcut: an XHTML tag may be opened and closed within the same tag, by including a slash before the end of the tag like this: . The introduction of this shorthand, which is not used in the SGML declaration for HTML 4.01, may confuse earlier software unfamiliar with this new convention. A fix for this is remove the slash preceding the closing angle bracket, as such: .\nTo understand the subtle differences between HTML and XHTML, consider the transformation of a valid and well-formed XHTML 1.0 document that adheres to Appendix C (see below) into a valid HTML 4.01 document. Making this translation requires the following steps:\nThose are the main changes necessary to translate a document from XHTML 1.0 to HTML 4.01. To translate from HTML to XHTML would also require the addition of any omitted opening or closing tags. Whether coding in HTML or XHTML it may just be best to always include the optional tags within an HTML document rather than remembering which tags can be omitted.\nA well-formed XHTML document adheres to all the syntax requirements of XML. A valid document adheres to the content specification for XHTML, which describes the document structure.\nThe W3C recommends several conventions to ensure an easy migration between HTML and XHTML. The following steps can be applied to XHTML 1.0 documents only:\nBy carefully following the W3C's compatibility guidelines, a user agent should be able to interpret the document equally as HTML or XHTML. For documents that are XHTML 1.0 and have been made compatible in this way, the W3C permits them to be served either as HTML (with a codice_49 MIME type), or as XHTML (with an codice_54 or codice_55 MIME type). When delivered as XHTML, browsers should use an XML parser, which adheres strictly to the XML specifications for parsing the document's contents.\nTransitional versus strict.\nHTML 4 defined three different versions of the language: Strict, Transitional (once called Loose), and Frameset. The Strict version is intended for new documents and is considered best practice, while the Transitional and Frameset versions were developed to make it easier to transition documents that conformed to older HTML specifications or did not conform to any specification to a version of HTML 4. The Transitional and Frameset versions allow for presentational markup, which is omitted in the Strict version. Instead, cascading style sheets are encouraged to improve the presentation of HTML documents. Because XHTML 1 only defines an XML syntax for the language defined by HTML 4, the same differences apply to XHTML 1 as well.\nThe Transitional version allows the following parts of the vocabulary, which are not included in the Strict version:\nThe Frameset version includes everything in the Transitional version, as well as the codice_137 element (used instead of codice_56) and the codice_139 element.\nFrameset versus transitional.\nIn addition to the above transitional differences, the frameset specifications (whether XHTML 1.0 or HTML 4.01) specify a different content model, with codice_137 replacing codice_56, that contains either codice_139 elements, or optionally codice_60 with a codice_56.\nSummary of specification versions.\nAs this list demonstrates, the loose versions of the specification are maintained for legacy support. However, contrary to popular misconceptions, the move to XHTML does not imply a removal of this legacy support. Rather the X in XML stands for extensible and the W3C is modularizing the entire specification and opens it up to independent extensions. The primary achievement in the move from XHTML 1.0 to XHTML 1.1 is the modularization of the entire specification. The strict version of HTML is deployed in XHTML 1.1 through a set of modular extensions to the base XHTML 1.1 specification. Likewise, someone looking for the loose (transitional) or frameset specifications will find similar extended XHTML 1.1 support (much of it is contained in the legacy or frame modules). Modularization also allows for separate features to develop on their own timetable. So for example, XHTML 1.1 will allow quicker migration to emerging XML standards such as MathML (a presentational and semantic math language based on XML) and XForms\u2014a new highly advanced web-form technology to replace the existing HTML forms.\nIn summary, the HTML 4 specification primarily reined in all the various HTML implementations into a single clearly written specification based on SGML. XHTML 1.0, ported this specification, as is, to the new XML-defined specification. Next, XHTML 1.1 takes advantage of the extensible nature of XML and modularizes the whole specification. XHTML 2.0 was intended to be the first step in adding new features to the specification in a standards-body-based approach.\nWHATWG HTML versus HTML5.\nThe HTML Living Standard, which is developed by WHATWG, is the official version, while W3C HTML5 is no longer separate from WHATWG.\nWYSIWYG editors.\nThere are some WYSIWYG editors (\"what you see is what you get\"), in which the user lays out everything as it is to appear in the HTML document using a graphical user interface (GUI), often similar to word processors. The editor renders the document rather than showing the code, so authors do not require extensive knowledge of HTML.\nThe WYSIWYG editing model has been criticized, primarily because of the low quality of the generated code; there are voices advocating a change to the WYSIWYM model (\"what you see is what you mean\").\nWYSIWYG editors remain a controversial topic because of their perceived flaws such as:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is a major character in Homer's \"Iliad\", where he leads the Trojans and their allies in the defense of Troy, killing countless Greek warriors. He is ultimately killed in single combat by the Greek hero Achilles, who proceeds to drag his dead body around the city of Troy behind his chariot.\nEtymology.\nIn Greek, is a derivative agent noun of the verb , archaic form * ('to have' or 'to hold'), from Proto-Indo-European ('to hold') ; , therefore, would seem to mean \"holder\" or \"possessor\" (perhaps emphasizing his princely status), or could be taken to mean 'holding fast' (perhaps emphasizing his conduct during the siege of Ilium by the Argives). , or as found in Aeolic poetry, is also an epithet of Zeus in his capacity as 'he who holds [everything together]'. The name was in use during Mycenaean times, as evidenced by a servant with the name referred to in a Linear B tablet. In the tablet, the name is spelled , .\nMoses I. Finley proposed that the Homeric hero was partly based on an earlier Theban hero of the same name.\nDescription.\nHector is described by the sixth-century Christian chronicler John Malalas in his account of the \"Chronography\" as \"dark-skinned, tall, very stoutly built, strong, good nose, wooly-haired, good beard, squinting, speech defect, noble, fearsome warrior, deep-voiced\". Meanwhile, in the account attributed to the legendary Trojan priest and author Dares Phrygius, he is described as \"... [speaking] with a slight lisp. His complexion was fair, his hair curly. His eyes would blink attractively. His movements were swift. His face, with its beard, was noble. He was handsome, fierce, and high-spirited, merciful to the citizens, and deserving of love\". Greek author and poet Homer portrayed Hector as \"peace-loving, thoughtful, as well as bold, a good son, husband and father, and without darker motives.\"\nBiography.\nHector of Troy is a Trojan prince and warrior. He is the first-born son of King Priam and Queen Hecuba, making him a prince of the royal house and heir to his father's throne. Hector weds Andromache, who bore him a son, Scamandrius, whom the people of Troy know as Astyanax. According to some accounts, he had other children including Oxynios and Laodamas.\nHector throughout the Trojan War brings glory to the Trojans as their best fighter. He is loved by all his people and known for never turning down a fight. He is gracious to all and thus thought of favorably by all but the Achaeans, who both hate and fear him as the Trojans' best warrior. He turns the tide of battle, breaking down their barriers and slaughtering their troops.\nWhen Hector kills Patroclus, Achilles\u2014who had refused to fight because of a slight by Agamemnon\u2014reenters the war to avenge his friend, and the Trojans are beaten back again. Hector's parents plead for him to take shelter within the city walls. Hector refuses, wanting to talk with Achilles, in an attempt to resolve the altercation without bloodshed, though Achilles is not one to be placated after Hector has slain his close friend, Patroclus. Achilles chases Hector around the gates of Troy three times. Apollo gives Hector strength so he can always stay in the lead. But whenever he nears the entrance to the city, Achilles cuts him off. Finally Athena takes the guise of his favorite brother, Deiphobus, telling him that they can face Achilles together. Tricked into thinking he might have a chance at winning, Hector waits for Achilles. He then proposes that whoever wins, be it he or Achilles, will be respectful to the other's body and give it back so there can be a proper burial. Achilles refuses, saying that there is \"...no love between us. No truce till the other falls and gluts with blood\" (Book 22, 313\u2013314). After a short fight, Achilles stabs Hector in the throat, which results in his fated death. Hector then foretells Achilles' own death, saying that he will be killed by Paris and Apollo.\nAfter slaying him, Achilles strips him of his armor. The other Achaeans then gather to look upon and stab Hector's body. Achilles says a few words in victory and ties Hector's body by the heels to his chariot. He drags the body around the city of Troy, as the Trojans watch from the walls and lament, especially Andromache, Hector's wife. The desecration of Hector's body by Achilles is considered an affront to the gods and ultimately leads to Achilles' downfall.\nDuring and after Patroclus' funeral, Achilles drags Hector's body around his pyre. However, the gods Aphrodite and Apollo protected his body from the dogs, disfigurement, and decomposition. Twelve days elapse before Priam goes to Achilles to ransom his son's body.\nMythology.\nGreatest warrior of Troy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAccording to the \"Iliad\", Hector did not approve of war between the Greeks and the Trojans.\nFor ten years, the Achaeans besieged Troy and their allies in the east. Hector commanded the Trojan army, with a number of subordinates including Polydamas, and his brothers Deiphobus, Helenus and Paris. By all accounts, Hector was the best warrior the Trojans and their allies could field, and his fighting prowess was admired by Greeks and his own people alike.\nDuel with Protesilaus.\nIn the \"Iliad\", Hector's exploits in the war prior to the events of the book are recapitulated. He had fought the Greek champion Protesilaus in single combat at the start of the war and killed him. A prophecy had stated that the first Greek to land on Trojan soil would die. Thus, Protesilaus, Ajax, and Odysseus would not land. Finally, Odysseus threw his shield out and landed on that instead of the ground, Protesilaus jumped next from his own ship onto the ground making him the first to touch the Trojan soil. In the ensuing fight, Hector killed him, fulfilling the prophecy.\nDuel with Ajax.\nAs described by Homer in the \"Iliad\" at the advice of Hector's brother Helenus (who also is divinely inspired) and being told by him that he is not destined to die yet, Hector manages to get both armies seated and challenges any one of the Greek warriors to single combat. The Argives are initially reluctant to accept the challenge. However, after Nestor's chiding, nine Greek heroes step up to the challenge and draw by lot to see who is to face Hector. Ajax wins. Hector is unable to pierce Ajax's famous shield, but Ajax crushes Hector's shield with a rock and stabs through his armor with a spear, drawing blood, upon which the god Apollo intervenes, and the duel is ended, as the sun is setting. Hector gives Ajax his sword, which Ajax later uses to kill himself. Ajax gives Hector his girdle that Achilles later attaches to his chariot to drag Hector's corpse around the walls of Troy.\nThe Greeks and the Trojans make a truce to bury the dead. In the early dawn the next day, the Greeks take advantage of the truce to build a wall and ditch around the ships, while Zeus watches in the distance.\nDuel with Achilles.\nAnother mention of Hector's exploits in the early years of war is given in the \"Iliad\" in book IX. During the embassy to Achilles, Odysseus, Phoenix and Ajax all try to persuade Achilles to rejoin the fight. In his response, Achilles points out that while Hector is terrorizing the Greek forces now, and that while he himself had fought in their front lines, Hector had 'no wish' to take his force far beyond the walls and out from the Skaian Gate and nearby oak tree. He then claims, 'There he stood up to me alone one day, and he barely escaped my onslaught.'\nAnother duel takes place, although Hector receives help from Aeneas (his cousin) and Deiphobus, when Hector rushes to try to save his brother Troilus from Achilles. He comes too late; Troilus has already perished. All Hector can do is to take the body, while Achilles escapes after he fights his way through the Trojan reinforcements.\nIn the tenth year of the war, observing Paris avoiding combat with Menelaus, Hector scolds him with having brought trouble on his whole country and now refusing to fight. Paris therefore proposes single combat between himself and Menelaus, with Helen to go to the victor, ending the war. The duel, however, leads to inconclusive results due to intervention by Aphrodite, who leads Paris off the field. After Pandarus wounds Menelaus with an arrow, the fight begins again.\nThe Greeks attack and drive the Trojans back. Hector must now go out to lead a counter-attack. According to Homer, his wife Andromache, carrying in her arms her son Astyanax, intercepts Hector at the gate, pleading with him not to go out for her sake as well as his son's. Hector knows that Troy and the house of Priam are doomed to fall and that the gloomy fate of his wife and infant son will be to die or go into slavery in a foreign land. With understanding, compassion, and tenderness, he explains that he cannot personally refuse to fight, and comforts her with the idea that no one can take him until it is his time to go. The gleaming bronze helmet frightens Astyanax and makes him cry. Hector takes it off, embraces his wife and son, and for his sake prays aloud to Zeus that his son might be chief after him, become more glorious in battle than he, to bring home the blood of his enemies, and make his mother proud. Once he leaves for battle, those in the house begin to mourn, as they know he would not return. Hector and Paris pass through the gate and rally the Trojans, raising havoc among the Greeks.\nTrojan counter-attack.\nZeus weighs the fates of the two armies in the balance, and that of the Greeks sinks. The Trojans press the Greeks into their camp over the ditch and wall and would have laid hands on the ships, but Agamemnon personally rallies the Greeks. The Trojans are driven off, night falls, and Hector resolves to take the camp and burn the ships the next day. The Trojans bivouac in the field.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A thousand camp-fires gleamed upon the plain ...\nThe next day Agamemnon rallies the Greeks and drives the Trojans\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;like a herd of cows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked them ...\nHector refrains from battle until Agamemnon leaves the field, wounded in the arm by a spear. Then Hector rallies the Trojans:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... like some fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea ...\nDiomedes and Odysseus hinder Hector and win the Greeks some time to retreat, but the Trojans sweep down upon the wall and rain blows upon it. The Greeks in the camp contest the gates to secure entrance for their fleeing warriors. The Trojans try to pull down the ramparts while the Greeks rain arrows upon them. Hector smashes open a gate with a large stone, clears the gate, and calls on the Trojans to scale the wall, which they do, and\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... all was uproar and confusion.\nThe battle rages inside the camp. Hector goes down, hit by a stone thrown by Ajax, but Apollo arrives from Olympus and infuses strength into \"the shepherd of the people\", who orders a chariot attack, with Apollo clearing the way. After much war across several books of the \"Iliad\", Hector lays hold of Protesilaus' ship and calls for fire. The Trojans cannot bring it to him, as Ajax kills everyone who tries. Eventually, Hector breaks Ajax's spear with his sword, forcing him to give ground, and he sets the ship ablaze.\nThese events are all according to the will of the gods, who have decreed the fall of Troy, and therefore intend to tempt Achilles back into the war. Patroclus, Achilles' closest companion, disguised in Achilles' armor, enters the combat leading the Myrmidons and the rest of the Achaeans to force a Trojan withdrawal. After Patroclus has routed the Trojan army, Hector, with the aid of Apollo and Euphorbus, kills Patroclus, vaunting over him:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe dying Patroclus foretells Hector's death:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"You yourself are not one who shall live long, but now already death and powerful destiny are standing beside you, to go down under the hands of Aiakos' great son, Achilleus\"\nHector's last fight.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. ... death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and there is no way out of it \u2013 for so Zeus and his son Apollo the far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever ready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then die ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great thing that shall be told among men hereafter.\u2014\u200a\nHector strips the armor of Achilles off the fallen Patroclus and gives it to his men to take back to the city. Glaucus accuses Hector of cowardice for not challenging Ajax. Stung, Hector calls for the armor, puts it on, and uses it to rally the Trojans. Zeus regards the donning of a hero's armor as an act of insolence by a fool about to die, but it makes Hector strong for now.\nThe next day, the enraged Achilles renounces the wrath that kept him out of action and routs the Trojans, forcing them back to the city. Hector chooses to remain outside the gates of Troy to face Achilles \u2013 motivated in part due to having ignored Polydamas's counsel to retreat the night before, a decision which led to the deaths of many Trojans. Achilles chases him around the city three times before Hector masters his fear and turns to face Achilles. But Athena, in the disguise of Hector's brother Deiphobus, has deluded Hector. He requests from Achilles that the victor should return the other's body after the duel (though Hector himself made it clear he planned to throw the body of Patroclus to the dogs), but Achilles refuses. Achilles hurls his spear at Hector, who dodges it, but Athena brings it back to Achilles' hands without Hector noticing. Hector then throws his own spear at Achilles; it hits his shield and does no injury. When Hector turns to face his supposed brother to retrieve another spear, he sees no one there. At that moment he realizes that he is doomed. Hector decides that he will go down fighting and that men will talk about his bravery in years to come.\nHector pulls out his sword, now his only weapon, and charges. But Achilles grabs his thrown spears that were delivered to him by the unseen Athena. Achilles then aims his spear and strikes Hector around the collar bone, the only part of the stolen armor of Achilles that did not protect Hector. The wound is fatal yet allowed Hector to speak to Achilles. In his final moments, Hector begs Achilles for an honorable funeral, but Achilles replies that he will let the dogs and vultures devour Hector's flesh. Hector dies, prophesying that Achilles' death will follow soon:\nBe careful now; for I might be made into the gods' curse upon you, on that day when Paris and Phoibos Apollo destroy you in the Skaian gates, for all your valor.\nAfter his death, Achilles slits Hector's heels and passes the girdle that Ajax had given Hector through the slits. He then fastens the girdle to his chariot and drives his fallen enemy through the dust to the Danaan camp. For the next twelve days, Achilles mistreats the body, but it remains preserved from all injury by Apollo and Aphrodite. After these twelve days, the gods can no longer stand watching it and send down two messengers: Iris, another messenger god, and Thetis, the mother of Achilles. Thetis has told Achilles to allow King Priam to come and take the body for ransom. Once King Priam has been notified that Achilles will allow him to claim the body, he goes to his strongroom to withdraw the ransom. The ransom King Priam offers includes twelve fine robes, twelve white mantles, several richly embroidered tunics, ten bars of yellow gold, a very beautiful cup, and several cauldrons. Priam himself goes to claim his son's body, and Hermes grants him safe passage by casting a charm that will make anyone who looks at him fall asleep.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nThink of thy father, and this helpless face behold\nSee him in me, as helpless and as old!\nThough not so wretched: there he yields to me,\nThe first of men in sovereign misery!\nThus forced to kneel, thus groveling to embrace\nThe scourge and ruin of my realm and race;\nSuppliant my children\u2019s murderer to implore,\nAnd kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore!\n&lt;/poem&gt;\u2014\u200a\nAchilles is moved by Priam's actions and, following his mother's orders sent by Zeus, returns Hector's body to Priam and promises him a truce of twelve days to allow the Trojans to perform funeral rites for Hector. Priam returns to Troy with the body of his son, and it is given full funeral honors. Even Helen mourns Hector, for he had always been kind to her and protected her from spite. The last lines of the \"Iliad\" are dedicated to Hector's funeral. Homer concludes by referring to the Trojan prince as the \"Breaker of Horses.\"\nIn Virgil's \"Aeneid\", the dead Hector appears to Aeneas in a dream urging him to flee Troy.\nReception and analysis.\nMany scholars consider Hector to be the most sympathetic character in the \"Iliad\", more than the main hero of the story, Achilles. For example, Richmond Lattimore writes that Hector \"is still the hero who forever captures the affection of the modern reader, far more strongly than his conqueror [Achilles] has ever done\". Hector's strong emotional relationship with his family has been cited as a feature which makes his character particularly sympathetic and tragic. Lattimore and Steven Farron interpret Hector as a naturally unwarlike person driven to fight by the circumstances. Lattimore writes that Hector does not believe in Paris' cause but fights anyway out of a sense of duty and concern about the opinions of others:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Some hidden weakness, not cowardice but perhaps the fear of being called a coward, prevents him from liquidating a war which he knows perfectly well is unjust. This weakness, which is not remote from his boasting, nor from his valour [...], is what kills him.\nEmily Wilson describes Hector as bringing on his own death through his pursuit of martial glory, itself a result of his \"dread of shame\" and the demands of his social role as a warrior. Instead of following his wife's practical advice to defend Troy from the city wall, Hector insists on fighting on the frontlines for the sake of glory. Thus, Wilson writes, Hector isolates himself from his society and its immediate needs through his efforts to uphold the warrior's code. James M. Redfield sees Hector's fate in the \"Iliad\" as \"in some general sense fated and necessary\" but \"also, when and as it occurs, the consequence of his own errors and chosen by himself\". Ultimately, writes Redfield, it is not any flaw in Hector's character which leads to his doom but his \"aidos\" ('shame' or 'fear of disgrace'). From the perspective of Homeric culture, where morality and conformity to social norms are not distinguished, \"aidos\" is the \"emotional foundation of virtue\". Hector falls victim to his fear of disgrace before his community and is \"defeated by his own characteristic goodness\".\nMany, but not all, scholars of the \"Iliad\" see an incongruence between Hector's in-story reputation and his actual achievements. He is described by different characters as the most fearsome warrior among the Trojans but falls short of these expectations on many occasions. Examples of this include his poor performance in duels with Ajax and Diomedes; his avoidance of Agamemnon; his victory over Patroclus only with the help of Apollo and another Trojan; and his flight in fear from Achilles before finally facing him. Different explanations have been proposed for this inconsistency. According to John Scott, who theorized that Hector was invented by Homer and not present in the pre-Homeric tradition of the Trojan War, Homer could not change the circumstances of the deaths of the major Greek heroes by having them be slain by Hector. Therefore, he gave Hector \"human and moral excellences\" to make up for his lack of martial achievements. According to another view, in the original tradition, Hector was in fact a great warrior, but his achievements were deliberately diminished by later bards (per the Analyst view of the Homeric epics' composition) because of their pro-Greek bias. Lattimore writes that Homer's consistent efforts to reduce Hector's achievements result in one of the poet's \"accidental triumphs\", since they actually make the reader \"sense deception, and feel that Hektor \"'really was\"' greater than Patroklos or any other Achaian except Achilleus\". Steven Farron agrees that the incongruence between Hector's achievements and reputation is a deliberate choice by the author but rejects the idea that it reflects a pro-Greek bias. Farron states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The contradictions between Hector's domestic strengths and military weaknesses and between his reputation and achievements form a coherent, tragic character. His tragedy is that he is a peaceful, home-loving man who is forced by circumstances into the role of the great hero and defender of Troy. But despite his desperate efforts, he is unable to fulfil that role and live up to the expectations that everyone, including himself, has for him.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13208", "revid": "46051904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13208", "title": "Hera", "text": "Goddess from Greek mythology, wife and sister of Zeus\nIn ancient Greek religion, Hera (; ; in Ionic and Homeric Greek) is the goddess of marriage, women, and family, and the protector of women during childbirth. In Greek mythology, she is queen of the twelve Olympians and Mount Olympus, sister and wife of Zeus, and daughter of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. One of her defining characteristics in myth is her jealous and vengeful nature in dealing with any who offended her, especially Zeus's numerous adulterous lovers and illegitimate offspring.\nHer iconography usually presents her as a dignified, matronly figure, upright or enthroned, crowned with a \"polos\" or diadem, sometimes veiled as a married woman. She is the patron goddess of lawful marriage. She presides over weddings, blesses and legalises marital unions, and protects women from harm during childbirth. Her sacred animals include the cow, cuckoo, and peacock. She is sometimes shown holding a pomegranate as an emblem of immortality. Her Roman counterpart is Juno.\nEtymology.\nThe name Hera (H\u0113ra or H\u0113r\u0113) has several possible and mutually exclusive etymologies. One possibility is to connect it with Greek \"\u1f65\u03c1\u03b1\" (\"h\u014dra\", season) or, according to Plato, with \"\u1f10\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\" (\"erat\u0113\", \"beloved\"); another one is to interpret it as \"ripe for marriage\". as Zeus is said to have married her for love. According to Plutarch, Hera was an allegorical name and an anagram of \"a\u0113r\" (\u1f00\u03ae\u03c1, \"air\"). So begins the section on Hera in Walter Burkert's \"Greek Religion\". In a note, he records other scholars' arguments \"for the meaning Mistress as a feminine to \"Heros\", Master\", with uncertain origin. John Chadwick, a decipherer of Linear B, remarks \"her name may be connected with \"h\u0113r\u014ds\" (\u1f25\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2, 'hero'), but that is no help since it too is etymologically obscure.\" A. J. van Windekens proposes the meaning \"young cow, heifer\", which is consonant with Hera's common epithet \u03b2\u03bf\u1ff6\u03c0\u03b9\u03c2 (\"bo\u014dpis\", \"cow-eyed\"). Robert S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin. Her name is attested in Mycenaean Greek, written in Linear B syllabary as \"e-ra\", appearing on tablets found in Pylos and Thebes; it is attested also in the Cypriotic dialect, in the dative form \"e-ra-i\".\nThe Proto-Indo-European root might have meant either 'the female who is attached/coupled' or 'the female who attaches herself' (as in both socially and physically or emotionally).\nMany theophoric names, such as Heracles, Heraclitus, Herodotus and Herodicus, derive from Hera.\nEpithets.\nHera bore several epithets in the mythological tradition and in literature. In the historical times the majority of the Greeks recognized Hera as the consort of Zeus. Hera is the protector of marriage and of the rights of the married women. In some cults she has some functions of the earth goddess. She is occasionally related to warfare as tutelary goddess.\nGoddess of marriage and bride.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nConsort of Zeus.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFounder and protector.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs an earth and fertility goddess.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs goddess of the hymns.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPlace of worship.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWarlike character.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLocal cults.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOrigins.\nIn historical times, the majority of the Greeks recognized Hera as the consort of Zeus. Zeus was the protector of rights and mores, and his partner Hera became the protector of legal marriage and the rights of married women . Hera emerged from a form of the \"Mycenean goddess of the palace\" and became the spouse of Zeus. Modern scholars suggest that Hera is not only the Olympian sky-goddess, but in some cults she may be identified with the earth-goddess. Her ancient connection with her sacred animal, the cow, still existed in historical times. She is probably related to Near-Eastern forms of cow-goddesses such as Hathor or Bat. The Greek earth-goddess Gaia is occasionally identified with Hera. Gaia may be related to the Vedic earth-goddess Prithvi, who was also associated with the cow and is the consort of Dyaus.\nMycenean Greece.\nAn inscription in Linear B on a tablet found at Pylos mentions offerings \"to Zeus-Hera-Drimios\"; Drimios is the son of Zeus. Hera was the tutelary goddess of Argos and it is possible that she had Mycenean origin. Martin P. Nilsson suggested that Hera is mainly the \"Argei\u0113\" (\u1f08\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03b7), a name given by Homer which describes her not as Greek, but as an Argive goddess. She is the protectress of the citadel. In literature Argos is called \"d\u014dma H\u0113ras\" (the house of Hera) and the Argives are called her people by Pindar. Homer in Iliad uses the formula \"bo\u014dpis potnia H\u0113r\u0113)\" (cow-eyed, mistress Hera), which probably relates her to a form of the Mediterranean goddess of nature. The epithet Qo-wi-ja ( bo\u014dpis) appears in a Linear B inscription. Walter Burkert notices that it is difficult to confirm that the epithet \"bowpis\" corresponds to a Greek belief. However it is possible that Hera was conceived as a cow in her archaic cults.\nConsort of Zeus.\nHera exists as a spouse of Zeus and their \"sacred marriage\" was celebrated in many Greek festivals in a processional ceremony from ancient times. The myth of the premarital approach of Hera by Zeus is early mentioned by Homer . It is possible that the myth has its origins to an old custom of the European country population, the premarital intercourse of the engaged couple. According to Walter Burkert the \"Mediterranean goddess of nature\" becomes the bride of the Greek sky-god. He notices that \"the disappearance and retrieval of Hera has parallels with other fertility cults\" . Hera was originally a goddess of fertility in her fest \"Toneia\" at Samos and at Knossos in Crete. At Samos the image of Hera was hidden bounted in willows and the participants tried to discover it. At Knossos Zeus is mating with the earth goddess (finally named Hera) in a very ancient ritual. In her festival Daedala at Plataia there is an account of Hera's quarrel with Zeus and their reconciliation.\nNear-Eastern origin.\nIn Crete the bull was associated with religious practices. In the legend of the Minotaur the Queen of Knossos is hidden inside an artificial hollow cow and she is mating with a bull-form god in a sacred ceremony. The hieros gamos indicates a ritual of fertility magic, which was probably introduced from Near East in the Aegean region. The \"hieros gamos\" of Zeus with the earth goddess (finally named Hera) was celebrated at Knossos in Crete. In Near East the solar-deity and the moon-goddess are often represented as a bull and a cow and Roscher proposed that Hera was a moon-goddess. The combination feminine divinity-cow-moon is not unusual in Crete and Near East. The relationship of Hera with the cow still existed in the historical times and this probably relates her to Near-Eastern forms of cow-goddesses like Hathor (or Bat). The Egyptian sky-goddess Hathor is the consort of the sky-god Horus.\nIndo-european origin.\nIn the Vedic tradition the earth-goddess Prithvi is the consort of the sky-god Dyaus and she is associated with the cow. Prithvi may be identified with the Greek goddess Gaia. Pherecydes of Syros in his cosmogony describes the mating of two divine principles: The marriage of Zas with Chthonie. Geoffrey Kirk notices that after the marriage \"Cthonie\" becomes Ge who probably takes charge of the protection of marriage. Hera is occasionally identified with \"Ge\". In a fragment of Euripides the Aether of Zeus is the sky-god who is the father of men and gods, and the earth-goddess Ge is the mother of all life. It seems that Io the priestess of Hera at Argos and consort of Zeus, was another form of Hera. In a Greek myth \"Io\" is transformed into a cow . This seems to be correlated to how Homer in Iliad uses the formula \"bo\u014dpis potnia H\u0113r\u0113)\" (cow-eyed, mistress Hera), suggesting that they may have been syncretized.\nCult.\nThe worship of Hera was sparse in Thessaly, Attica, Phocis and Achaea. In Boeotia she is related to the fest Daedala. The main center of her cult was North-Eastern Peloponnese, especially Argolis. ( Argos, Tiryns, Corinth, Sicyon, Epidaurus and Hermione). She was worshipped at the Arcadian cities Mantineia, Megalopolis, Stymphalus and at Sparta. The oldest temple at Olympia belonged to Hera. In the islands she was worshipped at Samos, Paros, Delos, Amorgos, Thera, Kos, Rhodes and Crete. The island Euboea was considered her holy place. A month was named after Hera at Delphi (\"Heraios\"), Olous, Laconia, Tinos (\"Herai\u014dn\"), Pergamos (\"Heraos\"). Hera is the \"Olympia\", \"Queen\", \"Anassa\", the Queen of heaven. The royal quality of her was preserved by the monuments of Greek art.\nHera may have been the first deity to whom the Greeks dedicated an enclosed roofed temple sanctuary, at Samos about 800 BCE. It was replaced later by the Heraion of Samos, one of the largest of all Greek temples (altars were in front of the temples under the open sky). There were many temples built on this site, so the evidence is somewhat confusing, and archaeological dates are uncertain.\nThe temple created by the Rhoecus sculptors and architects was destroyed between 570 and 560 BCE. This was replaced by the Polycratean temple of 540\u2013530 BCE. In one of these temples, we see a forest of 155 columns. There is also no evidence of tiles on this temple suggesting either the temple was never finished or that the temple was open to the sky.\nEarlier sanctuaries, whose dedication to Hera is less certain, were of the Mycenaean type called \"house sanctuaries\". Samos excavations have revealed votive offerings, many of them late 8th and 7th centuries BCE, which show that Hera at Samos was not merely a local Greek goddess of the Aegean. The museum there contains figures of gods and suppliants and other votive offerings from Armenia, Babylon, Iran, Assyria, and Egypt, testimony to the reputation which this sanctuary of Hera enjoyed, and the large influx of pilgrims. Compared to this mighty goddess, who also possessed the earliest temple at Olympia and two of the great fifth and sixth-century temples of Paestum, the termagant of Homer and the myths is an \"almost... comic figure,\" according to Burkert.\nThough the greatest and earliest free-standing temple to Hera was the Heraion of Samos, in the Greek mainland Hera was especially worshipped as \"Argive Hera\" (\"Hera Argeia\") at her sanctuary that stood between the former Mycenaean city-states of Argos and Mycenae, where the festivals in her honor called \"Heraia\" were celebrated. \"The three cities I love best,\" she declares in the \"Iliad\", book iv, \"are Argos, Sparta and Mycenae of the broad streets.\" There were also temples to Hera in Olympia, Corinth, Tiryns, Perachora and the sacred island of Delos. In Magna Graecia, two Doric temples to Hera were constructed at Paestum, about 550 BCE and about 450 BCE. One of them, long called the \"Temple of Poseidon\" was identified in the 1950s as a temple of Hera.\nThe Daedala fire festival on Cithaeron near Plataea, included an account of Hera's quarrel with Zeus and their reconciliation.\nHera's importance in the early archaic period is attested by the large building projects undertaken in her honor. The temples of Hera in the two main centers of her cult, the Heraion of Samos and the Heraion of Argos in the Argolis, were the very earliest monumental Greek temples constructed, in the 8th century BCE. At Argos the Dorian \"Heraion\" was built on the hill of Prosymna near Mycenean hero-tombs. At Samos the cult activity near the altar begun in late Mycenean period and a big altar was built in the 9th century BC.\nDuring the Hellenistic period (c.\u2009330 BCE \u2013 300 CE), Greek culture spread outside Greece across the Eastern Mediterranean region as a result of the conquests of Alexander the Great. The Hellenistic religion was often syncretic, and the Greek gods were identified with local deities as different aspects or names of the same divinity. Hera was identified with various local mother deities. As an example, the work \"On the Syrian Goddess\" suggests a cult worshipped a goddess that was simultaneously the Syrian goddess Atargatis and Hera. This even extended to early Christianity some; the \"Legend of Aphroditian\" identifies Hera with the Virgin Mary, perhaps due to one of Hera's abilities being her miraculous restoration of her own virginity.\nImportance.\nAccording to Walter Burkert, both Hera and Demeter have many characteristic attributes of Pre-Greek Great Goddesses.\nIn the same vein, British scholar Charles Francis Keary suggests that Hera had some sort of \"Earth Goddess\" worship in ancient times, connected to her possible origin as a Pelasgian goddess (as mentioned by Herodotus). In Greece the Mediterranean goddess of nature is the bride of the Greek sky-god . In her fest Daedala Hera is related to the nymph Plataia (consort of Zeus), an old forgotten form of the Greek earth-goddess. Plataia may be related to Gaia who is occasionally identified with Hera.\nAccording to Homeric Hymn II to Delian Apollo, Hera detained Eileithyia to prevent Leto from going into labor with Artemis and Apollo, since the father was Zeus. The other goddesses present at the birthing on Delos sent Iris to bring her. As she stepped upon the island, the divine birth began. In the myth of the birth of Heracles, it is Hera herself who sits at the door, delaying the birth of Heracles until her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Eurystheus, had been born first.\nThe Homeric Hymn to Pythian Apollo makes the monster Typhaon the offspring of archaic Hera in her ancient form, produced out of herself, like a monstrous version of Hephaestus, and whelped in a cave in Cilicia. She gave the creature to Python to raise.\nIn the Temple of Hera, Olympia, Hera's seated cult figure was older than the warrior figure of Zeus that accompanied it. Homer expressed her relationship with Zeus delicately in the \"Iliad\", in which she declares to Zeus, \"I am Cronus' eldest daughter, and am honourable not on this ground only, but also because I am your wife, and you are king of the gods.\"\nMatriarchy.\nThere has been considerable scholarship, reaching back to Johann Jakob Bachofen in the mid-nineteenth century, about the possibility that Hera, whose early importance in Greek religion is firmly established, was originally the goddess of a matriarchal people, presumably inhabiting Greece before the Hellenes. In this view, her activity as goddess of marriage established the patriarchal bond of her own subordination: her resistance to the conquests of Zeus is rendered as Hera's \"jealousy\", the main theme of literary anecdotes that undercut her ancient cult.\nHowever, it remains a controversial claim that an ancient matriarchy or a cultural focus on a monotheistic Great Goddess existed among the ancient Greeks or elsewhere. The claim is generally rejected by modern scholars as insufficiently evidenced. Walter Burkert notices that the ancient Kourotrophos figure is almost absent in Crete, and the nomination Mother Goddess was not the underlying principle in the Minoan religion.\nYouth.\nHera was most known as the matron goddess, \"Hera Teleia\", but she presided over weddings as well. In myth and cult, fragmentary references and archaic practices remain of the sacred marriage of Hera and Zeus. At Plataea, there was a sculpture of Hera seated as a bride by Callimachus, as well as the matronly standing Hera.\nHera was also worshipped as a virgin: there was a tradition in Stymphalia in Arcadia that there had been a triple shrine to Hera the Girl (\u03a0\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 [Pais]), the Adult Woman (\u03a4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 [Teleia]), and the Separated (\u03a7\u03ae\u03c1\u03b7 [Ch\u1e17r\u0113] 'Widowed' or 'Divorced'). In the region around Argos, the temple of Hera in Hermione near Argos was to Hera the Virgin. At the spring of Kanathos, close to Nauplia, Hera renewed her virginity annually, in rites that were not to be spoken of (\"arrheton\"). In her fire-festival Daedala at Plataia the puppet of the goddess was bathed in the river Asopos before the wedding ceremony. In the festival \"Toneia\" at Samos the image of the goddess was purified, bounted in willows and then probably hanged on a tree. Robert Graves interprets this as a representation of the new moon (Hebe), full moon (Hera), and old moon (Hecate), respectively personifying the Virgin (Spring), the Mother (Summer), and the destroying Crone (Autumn).\nFestivals.\nThe marriage of Zeus with Hera is the main theme in most Greek festivals celebrated in honour of the goddess. In the cults of Hera the dances and rites are performed by young married women. These choral dances reenacted early myth and ritual. Burkert notices that \"the disappearing and retrieval of Hera in some cults has parallels with other fertility cults\". The Greek aetiological myths (aitia) give a reasonable explanation of the ritual and replicate its structural form. This is accurate for \"aitia\" related to initiation rituals from youth to maturity. Ancient accounts refer to the retirement of Hera after a quarrel with Zeus. Hera's wrath may indicate the wrath and jealousy of the Greek wife. Other accounts refer to cultic trees or pillars. and rituals of the goddess of vegetation. Some accounts are related to rituals of the Bronze Age before the splitting of the \"Mistress of the animals\" into separate goddesses.\nEmblems.\nIn Hellenistic imagery, Hera's chariot was pulled by peacocks, birds not known to Greeks before the conquests of Alexander. Alexander's tutor, Aristotle, refers to it as \"the Persian bird.\" The peacock motif was revived in the Renaissance iconography that unified Hera and Juno. A bird that had been associated with Hera on an archaic level, when most of the Aegean goddesses were associated with \"their\" bird, was the cuckoo, which appears in mythic fragments concerning the first wooing of a virginal Hera by Zeus.\nHer archaic association was primarily with cattle, as a Cow Goddess, who was especially venerated in \"cattle-rich\" Euboea. On Cyprus, very early archaeological sites contain bull skulls that have been adapted for use as masks (see Bull (mythology)). Her familiar Homeric epithet \"Bo\u00f4pis\", is always translated \"cow-eyed\". In this respect, Hera bears some resemblance to the Ancient Egyptian deity Hathor, a maternal goddess associated with cattle. Hera absorbed the cult of her heifer-priestess Io and may be related to the Vedic earth-goddess Prithvi.\nScholar of Greek mythology Walter Burkert writes in \"Greek Religion\", \"Nevertheless, there are memories of an earlier aniconic representation, as a pillar in Argos and as a plank in Samos.\" At Argos in a Greek myth the priestess of Hera Phoronis ties her mistress to an aniconic pillar. At Samos Hera's plank was tied on a willow tree to ensure fertility.\nMythology.\nBirth.\nHera is the daughter of the Titans Cronus and Rhea, and the sister of Hestia, Demeter, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus. Cronus was fated to be overthrown by one of his children; to prevent this, he swallowed all of his newborn children whole until Rhea tricked him into swallowing a stone instead of her youngest child, Zeus. Zeus grew up in secret and then tricked his father into regurgitating his siblings, including Hera. Zeus then led the revolt against the Titans, banished them, and divided the dominion over the world with his brothers, Poseidon and Hades.\nOther traditions, however, appear to give Hera different upbringings. Pausanias states that she was nursed as an infant by the three daughters of the river Asterion: Euboia, Prosymna, and Akraia. Furthermore, in the Iliad, Hera states she was given by her mother to Tethys to be raised: \"I go now to the ends of the generous earth on a visit to the Ocean, whence the gods have risen, and Tethys our mother who brought me up kindly in their own house, and cared for me and took me from Rheia, at that time when Zeus of the wide brows drove Kronos underneath the earth and the barren water.\"\nMarriage with Zeus.\nHera is the goddess of marriage and childbirth rather than motherhood, and much of her mythology revolves around her marriage with her brother Zeus. She is charmed by him and she seduces him; he cheats on her and has many children with other goddesses and mortal women; she is intensely jealous and vindictive towards his children and their mothers; he is threatening and violent to her.\nIn the \"Iliad\", Zeus implies their marriage was some sort of elopement, as they lay secretly from their parents. Pausanias records a tale of how they came to be married in which Zeus transformed into a cuckoo to woo Hera. She caught the bird and kept it as her pet; this is why the cuckoo is seated on her sceptre. According to a scholion on Theocritus's \"Idylls\", when Hera was heading toward Mount Thornax alone, Zeus created a terrible storm and transformed himself into a cuckoo who flew down and sat on her lap. Hera covered him with her cloak. Zeus then transformed back and took hold of her; because she was refusing to sleep with him due to their mother, he promised to marry her.\nIn one account Hera refused to marry Zeus and hid in a cave to avoid him; an earthborn man named Achilles convinced her to give him a chance, and thus the two had their first sexual intercourse. According to a version attributed to Plutarch, Hera had been reared by a nymph named Macris on the island of Euboea, but Zeus stole her away, where Mt. Cithaeron \"afforded them a shady recess.\" When Macris came to look for her ward, the mountain-god Cithaeron drove her away, saying that Zeus was taking his pleasure there with Leto.\nAccording to Callimachus, their wedding feast lasted three hundred years. All the gods and mortals were invited, but a nymph named Chelone was disrespectful or refused to attend, so Zeus thus turned her into a tortoise. The Apples of the Hesperides that Heracles was tasked by Eurystheus to take were a wedding gift by Gaia to the couple.\nAfter a quarrel with Zeus, Hera left him and retreated to Euboea, and no word from Zeus managed to sway her mind. Cithaeron, the local king, then advised Zeus to take a wooden statue of a woman, wrap it up, and pretend to marry it. Zeus did as told, claiming \"she\" was Plataea, Asopus's daughter. Hera, once she heard the news, disrupted the wedding ceremony and tore away the dress from the figure only to discover it was but a lifeless statue, and not a rival in love. The queen and her king were reconciled, and to commemorate this the people there celebrated a festival called Daedala. During the festival, a re-enactment of the myth was celebrated, where a wooden statue of Hera was chosen, bathed in the river Asopus and then raised on a chariot to lead the procession like a bride, and then ritually burned.\nAccording to Diodorus Siculus, Alcmene, the mother of Heracles, was the very last mortal woman Zeus ever slept with; following the birth of Heracles, he ceased to beget humans altogether.\nLeto and the Twins: Apollo and Artemis.\nIn the early works of Homer and Hesiod, Hera displays no inherent animosity towards Leto or her children (for being children of an affair, that is. She quarrels with them for political reasons in the \"Iliad\"). In Hesiod's \"Theogony\", Leto is presented as one of Zeus's wives prior to Hera, giving no indication that Hera disliked them. In later variations of this story, our earliest account being the \"Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo\", Hera was enraged when she discovered that Leto was pregnant and that Zeus was the father; especially when she was told that Apollo would be more dear to Zeus than Hera's son Ares. Hera received help from Ares and Iris to prevent Leto from giving birth, whence they \"threatened all the cities which Leto approached, and prevented them from receiving her.\" Alternatively, Juno convinced the nature spirits to prevent Latona (Leto) from giving birth on terra-firma, the mainland, any island at sea, or any place under the sun, but Poseidon felt pity to Leto and guided her to the floating island of Delos, which was neither mainland nor a real island where Leto was able to give birth to her children. Afterwards, Zeus secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean. The island later became sacred to Apollo. Alternatively, Hera kidnapped her daughter Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor. The other gods bribed Hera with a beautiful necklace nobody could resist and she finally gave in.\nEither way, Artemis was born first (earlier sources make no mention of them being twins, so Artemis could be any age older than Apollo) and then assisted with the birth of Apollo. Some versions say Artemis helped her mother give birth to Apollo for nine days. Another variation states that Artemis was born one day before Apollo, on the island of Ortygia and that she helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo.\nLater, Tityos attempted to rape Leto at the behest of Hera. He was slain by Artemis and Apollo.\nThis account of the birth of Apollo and Artemis is contradicted by Hesiod in Theogony, as the twins are born prior to Zeus's marriage to Hera.\nSemele and Dionysus.\nWhen Hera learned that Semele, daughter of Cadmus King of Thebes, was pregnant by Zeus, she disguised herself as Semele's nurse and persuaded the princess to insist that Zeus show himself to her in his true form. When he was compelled to do so, having sworn by Styx, his thunder and lightning destroyed Semele. Zeus took Semele's unborn child, Dionysus, and completed its gestation sewn into his own thigh.\nIn another version, Dionysus was originally the son of Zeus by either Demeter or Persephone. Hera sent her Titans to rip the baby apart, from which he was called Zagreus (\"Torn in Pieces\"). Zeus rescued the heart; or, the heart was saved, variously, by Athena, Rhea, or Demeter. Zeus used the heart to recreate Dionysus and implant him in the womb of Semele\u2014hence Dionysus became known as \"the twice-born\". Certain versions imply that Zeus gave Semele the heart to eat to impregnate her. Hera tricked Semele into asking Zeus to reveal his true form, which killed her. Dionysus later managed to rescue his mother from the underworld and have her live on Mount Olympus.\nHeracles.\nHera is the stepmother and enemy of Heracles. The name Heracles means \"Glory of Hera\". In Homer's \"Iliad\", when Alcmene was about to give birth to Heracles, Zeus announced to all the gods that on that day a child by Zeus himself, would be born and rule all those around him. Hera, after requesting Zeus to swear an oath to that effect, descended from Olympus to Argos and made the wife of Sthenelus (son of Perseus) give birth to Eurystheus after only seven months, while at the same time preventing Alcmene from delivering Heracles. This resulted in the fulfillment of Zeus's oath in that it was Eurystheus rather than Heracles. In Pausanias' recounting, Hera sent witches (as they were called by the Thebans) to hinder Alcmene's delivery of Heracles. The witches were successful in preventing the birth until Historis, daughter of Tiresias, thought of a trick to deceive the witches. Like Galanthis, Historis announced that Alcmene had delivered her child; having been deceived, the witches went away, allowing Alcmene to give birth.\nHera's wrath against Zeus's son continued and while Heracles was still an infant, Hera sent two serpents to kill him as he lay in his cot. Heracles throttled the snakes with his bare hands and was found by his nurse playing with their limp bodies as if they were a child's toys.\nAccording to an earlier source, however, Hera had nothing to do with the snakes in Heracles's crib. Pherecydes said that \"it was Amphitryon who put the serpents in the bed, because [then] he would know which of the two children was his, and that when Iphicles fled, and Heracles stood his ground, he knew that Iphicles was begotten of his body.\"\nOne account of the origin of the Milky Way is that Zeus had tricked Hera into nursing the infant Heracles: discovering who he was, she pulled him from her breast and a spurt of her milk formed the smear across the sky that can be seen to this day. Her milk also created a white flower, the lily. Unlike any Greeks, the Etruscans instead pictured a full-grown bearded Heracles at Hera's breast, a reference to his adoption by her when he became an Immortal: he had previously wounded her severely in the breast.\nWhen Heracles reached adulthood, Hera drove him mad, which led him to murder his family and this later led to him undertaking his famous labours (Alternatively, according to Euripides's \"Herakles\", this happened after his labors had been completed). Hera assigned Heracles to labour for King Eurystheus at Mycenae. She attempted to make almost all of Heracles's twelve labours more difficult. When he fought the Lernaean Hydra, she sent a crab to bite at his feet in the hopes of distracting him. Later Hera stirred up the Amazons against him when he was on one of his quests, claiming that he kidnapped their queen, Hippolyte. When Heracles took the cattle of Geryon, he shot Hera in the right breast with a triple-barbed arrow: the wound was incurable and left her in constant pain, as Dione tells Aphrodite in the \"Iliad\", Book V. Afterwards, Hera sent a gadfly to bite the cattle, irritate them and scatter them. Hera then sent a flood which raised the water level of a river so much that Heracles could not ford the river with the cattle. He piled stones into the river to make the water shallower. When he finally reached the court of Eurystheus, the cattle were sacrificed to Hera.\nThat was not the only time Heracles had violently attacked Hera, either. After murdering Iphitus of Oechalia in cold blood and seeking purification for the crime from Neleus, king of Pylos, Neleus and his fourteen children turned him away. After being purified elsewhere, \"Heracles then marched against Neleus and not only sacked Pylos, \"but even wounded Hera, who was fighting as Neleus' ally\". As for Neleus himself, Heracles killed him and his children, except for the youngest, Nestor.\"\nEurystheus also wanted to sacrifice the Cretan Bull to Hera. She refused the sacrifice because it reflected glory on Heracles. The bull was released and wandered to Marathon, becoming known as the Marathonian Bull.\nSome myths state that in the end, Heracles befriended Hera by saving her from Porphyrion, a giant who tried to rape her during the Gigantomachy, and that she even gave her daughter Hebe as his bride. Whatever myth-making served to account for an archaic representation of Heracles as \"Hera's man\", it was thought suitable for the builders of the Heraion at Paestum to depict the exploits of Heracles in bas-relief.\nTrojan War.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA prophecy stated that a son of the sea-nymph Thetis, with whom Zeus fell in love after gazing upon her in the oceans off the Greek coast, would become greater than his father. Possibly for this reason, Thetis was betrothed to an elderly human king, Peleus son of Aeacus, either upon Zeus's orders, or because she wished to please Hera, who had raised her. All the gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of Peleus and Thetis (the eventual parents of Achilles) and brought many gifts. Only Eris, goddess of discord, was not invited and was stopped at the door by Hermes, on Zeus's order. She was annoyed at this, so she threw from the door a gift of her own: a golden apple inscribed with the word \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u1fc3 (kallist\u0113i, \"To the fairest\"). Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.\nThe goddesses quarreled bitterly over it, and none of the other gods would venture an opinion favoring one, for fear of earning the enmity of the other two. They chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of Paris, a Trojan prince. After bathing in the spring of Mount Ida where Troy was situated, they appeared before Paris to have him choose. The goddesses undressed before him, either at his request or for the sake of winning. Still, Paris could not decide, as all three were ideally beautiful, so they resorted to bribes. Hera offered Paris political power and control of all of Asia, while Athena offered wisdom, fame, and glory in battle, and Aphrodite offered the most beautiful mortal woman in the world as a wife, and he accordingly chose her. This woman was Helen, who was, unfortunately for Paris, already married to King Menelaus of Sparta. The other two goddesses were enraged by Paris's decision and, after the Trojan War started through Helen's abduction by Paris, they sided with the Greeks.\nHera plays a substantial role in \"The Iliad\", appearing in several books throughout the epic poem. She makes many attempts to thwart the Trojan Army. In books 1 and 2, Hera declares that the Trojans must be destroyed and persuades Athena to aid the Achaeans in battle, and she agrees to assist with interfering on their behalf.\nIn book 5, Hera and Athena plot to harm Ares, who had been seen by Diomedes in assisting the Trojans. Diomedes called for his soldiers to fall back slowly. Hera saw Ares's interference and asked Zeus for permission to drive Ares away from the battlefield. Hera encouraged Diomedes to attack Ares and he threw his spear at the god. Athena drove the spear into Ares's body, and he bellowed in pain and fled to Mount Olympus, forcing the Trojans to fall back.\nIn book 8, Hera tries to persuade Poseidon to disobey Zeus and help the Achaean army. He refuses, saying he doesn't want to go against Zeus. Determined to intervene in the war, Hera and Athena head to the battlefield. However, seeing the two flee, Zeus sent Iris to intercept them and make them return to Mount Olympus or face grave consequences. After prolonged fighting, Hera sees Poseidon aiding the Greeks and giving them the motivation to keep fighting.\nIn book 14 Hera devises a plan to deceive Zeus. Zeus set a decree that the gods were not allowed to interfere in the mortal war. Hera is on the side of the Achaeans, so she plans a Deception of Zeus where she seduces him, with help from Aphrodite, and tricks him into a deep sleep, with the help of Hypnos, so that the Gods could interfere without the fear of Zeus.\nIn book 21, Hera continues her interference with the battle as she tells Hephaestus to prevent the river from harming Achilles. Hephaestus sets the battlefield ablaze, causing the river to plead with Hera, promising her he will not help the Trojans if Hephaestus stops his attack. Hephaestus stops his assault and Hera returns to the battlefield where the gods begin to fight amongst themselves. After Apollo declines to battle Poseidon, Artemis eagerly engages Hera for a duel. Hera however treats the challenge as unimportant, easily disarming the haughty rival goddess and beating her with her own weapons. Artemis is left retreating back to Mount Olympus in tears to cry at Zeus's lap.\nMinor stories.\nThe Golden Fleece.\nHera hated Pelias, king of Iolcus, because he had killed Sidero, his step-grandmother, in one of her temples. She later convinced his nephew Jason to kill Pelias. The Golden Fleece was the item that Jason needed to get his mother Alcimide freed, which he obtained with the help of the sorceress Medea, who was influenced by the goddess. At the request of Hera, Aelous calmed all the winds but the \"steady\" west wind, to aid their crew, the Argonauts, on their journey home.\nCydippe.\nCydippe, a priestess of Hera, was on her way to a festival in the goddess's honor. The oxen which were to pull her cart were overdue and her sons, Biton and Cleobis, pulled the cart the entire way (45 stadia, 8 kilometers). Cydippe was impressed with their devotion to her and Hera, and so asked Hera to give her children the best gift a god could give a person. Hera ordained that the brothers would die in their sleep. This honor bestowed upon the children was later used by Solon as proof when trying to convince Croesus that it is impossible to judge a person's happiness until they have died a fruitful death after a joyous life.\nIxion.\nWhen Zeus had pity on Ixion and brought him to Olympus and introduced him to the gods, instead of being grateful, Ixion grew lustful for Hera. Zeus found out about his intentions and made a cloud in the shape of Hera, who was later named Nephele, and tricked Ixion into coupling with it. From their union came Centaurus. So Ixion was expelled from Olympus and Zeus ordered Hermes to bind Ixion to a winged fiery wheel that was always spinning. Therefore, Ixion was bound to a burning solar wheel for all eternity, first spinning across the heavens, but in later myth transferred to Tartarus.\nOlympian Rebellion.\nIn the \"Iliad\", Homer tells of another attempted overthrow, in which Hera, Poseidon, and Athena conspire to overpower Zeus and tie him in bonds. It is only because of Thetis, who summons Briareus, one of the Hecatoncheires, to Olympus, that the other Olympians abandon their plans (out of fear for Briareus).\nA\u00ebtos.\nAccording to the myth, A\u00ebtos was a beautiful boy born of the earth. While Zeus was young and hiding in Crete from his father Cronus who had devoured all of Zeus's siblings, A\u00ebtos became friends with the god and was among the first beings to swear fealty to him as new king. But years later, after Zeus had overthrown his father and become king in his place, Zeus's wife Hera turned A\u00ebtos into an eagle, out of fear that Zeus loved him. Thus the eagle became the sacred bird of Zeus, and a symbol of power and kingship.\nTiresias.\nTiresias was a priest of Zeus, and as a young man, he encountered two snakes mating and hit them with a stick. He was then transformed into a woman. As a woman, Tiresias became a priestess of Hera, married, and had children, including Manto. After seven years as a woman, Tiresias again found mating snakes; depending on the myth, either she made sure to leave the snakes alone this time, or, according to Hyginus, trampled on them and became a man once more.\nAs a result of his experiences, Zeus and Hera asked him to settle the question of which sex, male or female, experienced more pleasure during intercourse. Zeus claimed it was women; Hera claimed it was men. When Tiresias sided with Zeus, Hera struck him blind. Since Zeus could not undo what she had done, he gave him the gift of prophecy.\nAn alternative and less commonly told story has it that Tiresias was blinded by Athena after he stumbled onto her bathing naked. His mother, Chariclo, begged her to undo her curse, but Athena could not; she gave him a prophecy instead.\nIo and Argus.\nThe myth of Io has many forms and embellishments. Generally, Io was a priestess of Hera at the Heraion of Argos. Zeus lusted after her and either Hera turned Io into a heifer to hide her from Zeus, or Zeus did so to hide her from Hera but was discovered. Hera had Io tethered to an olive-tree and set Argus Panoptes (lit.\u2009'all-seeing') to watch over her, but Zeus sent Hermes to kill him. Infuriated, Hera then sent a gadfly (Greek , compare oestrus) to pursue and constantly sting Io, who fled into Asia and eventually reached Egypt. There Zeus restored her to human form and she gave birth to his son Epaphus.\nGerana.\nGerana was a queen of the Pygmies who boasted she was more beautiful than Hera. The wrathful goddess turned her into a crane and proclaimed that her bird descendants should wage eternal war on the Pygmy folk.\nLamia.\nLamia was a lovely queen of Libya, whom Zeus loved; Hera in jealousy robbed Lamia of their children, either by kidnapping and hiding them away, killing them, or causing Lamia herself to kill her own offspring. Lamia became disfigured from the torment, transforming into a terrifying being who hunted and killed the children of others.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13210", "revid": "5926430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13210", "title": "History of the ancient Levant", "text": "The Levant is the area in Southwest Asia, south of the Taurus Mountains, bounded by the Mediterranean Sea in the west, the Arabian Desert in the south, and Mesopotamia in the east. It stretches roughly north to south, from the Taurus Mountains to the Sinai Peninsula and Syrian Desert, and east to west between the Mediterranean Sea and the Khabur river. The term is often used to refer to the following regions or modern states: Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan and Hatay Province in Turkey. More broadly it also includes: Sinai (Egypt), Cilicia (Turkey) and Cyprus.\nThe Levant is one of the earliest centers of sedentism and agriculture in history, and some of the earliest agrarian cultures, Pre-Pottery Neolithic, developed in the region. Previously regarded as a peripheral region in the ancient Near East, modern academia largely considers the Levant as a center of civilization on its own, independent of Mesopotamia and Egypt. Throughout the Bronze and Iron ages, the Levant was home to many ancient Semitic-speaking peoples and kingdoms, and is considered by many to be the urheimat of Semitic languages.\nStone Age.\nPaleolithic.\nAnatomically modern Homo sapiens are demonstrated at the area of Mount Carmel in Canaan during the Middle Paleolithic dating from c.\u200990,000\u00a0BC. These migrants out of Africa seem to have been unsuccessful, and by c.\u200960,000\u00a0BC in the Levant, Neanderthal groups seem to have benefited from the worsening climate and replaced Homo sapiens, who were possibly confined once more to Africa.\nA second move out of Africa is demonstrated by the Boker Tachtit Upper Paleolithic culture, from 52,000 to 50,000\u00a0BC, with humans at Ksar Akil XXV level being modern humans. This culture bears close resemblance to the Badoshan Aurignacian culture of Iran, and the later Sebilian I Egyptian culture of c.\u200950,000\u00a0BC. Stephen Oppenheimer suggests that this reflects a movement of modern human groups back into North Africa, at this time.\nIt would appear this sets the date by which Homo sapiens Upper Paleolithic cultures begin replacing Neanderthal Levalo-Mousterian, and by c.\u200940,000\u00a0BC the region was occupied by the Levanto-Aurignacian Ahmarian culture, lasting from 39,000 to 24,000\u00a0BC. This culture was quite successful spreading as the Antelian culture (late Aurignacian), as far as Southern Anatolia, with the Atlitan culture.\nEpi-Palaeolithic.\nAfter the Late Glacial Maxima, a new Epipaleolithic culture appears. The appearance of the Kebaran culture, of microlithic type implies a significant rupture in the cultural continuity of Levantine Upper Paleolithic. The Kebaran culture, with its use of microliths, is associated with the use of the bow and arrow and the domestication of the dog. Extending from 18,000 to 10,500\u00a0BC, the Kebaran culture shows clear connections to the earlier microlithic cultures using the bow and arrow, and using grinding stones to harvest wild grains, that developed from the c.\u200924,000\u00a0\u2013 c.\u200917,000\u00a0BC Halfan culture of Egypt, that came from the still earlier Aterian tradition of the Sahara. Some linguists see this as the earliest arrival of Nostratic languages in the Middle East.\nKebaran culture was quite successful, and was ancestral to the later Natufian culture (12,500\u20139,500\u00a0BC), which extended throughout the whole of the Levantine region. These people pioneered the first sedentary settlements, and may have supported themselves from fishing and the harvest of wild grains plentiful in the region at that time. As of \u00a02018,[ [update]] the oldest remains of bread were discovered c.\u200912,400\u00a0BC at the archaeological site of Shubayqa 1, once home of the Natufian hunter-gatherers, roughly 4,000 years before the advent of agriculture.\nNatufian culture also demonstrates the earliest domestication of the dog, and the assistance of this animal in hunting and guarding human settlements may have contributed to the successful spread of this culture. In the northern Syrian, eastern Anatolian region of the Levant, Natufian culture at Cayonu and Mureybet developed the first fully agricultural culture with the addition of wild grains, later being supplemented with domesticated sheep and goats, which were probably domesticated first by the Zarzian culture of Northern Iraq and Iran (which like the Natufian culture may have also developed from Kebaran).\nNeolithic and Chalcolithic.\nBy 8500\u20137500\u00a0BC, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) culture developed out of the earlier local tradition of Natufian, dwelling in round houses, and building the first defensive site at Tell es-Sultan (ancient Jericho) (guarding a valuable fresh water spring). This was replaced in 7500\u00a0BC by Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB), dwelling in square houses, coming from Northern Syria and the Euphrates bend.\nDuring the period of 8500\u20137500\u00a0BC, another hunter-gatherer group, showing clear affinities with the cultures of Egypt (particularly the Outacha retouch technique for working stone) was in Sinai. This Harifian culture may have adopted the use of pottery from the Isnan culture and Helwan culture of Egypt (which lasted from 9000 to 4500\u00a0BC), and subsequently fused with elements from the PPNB culture during the climatic crisis of 6000\u00a0BC to form what Juris Zarins calls the Syro-Arabian pastoral technocomplex, which saw the spread of the first Nomadic pastoralists in the Ancient Near East. These extended southwards along the Red Sea coast and penetrating the Arabian bifacial cultures, which became progressively more Neolithic and pastoral, and extending north and eastwards, to lay the foundations for the tent-dwelling Martu and Akkadian peoples of Mesopotamia.\nIn the Amuq valley of Syria, PPNB culture seems to have survived, influencing further cultural developments further south. Nomadic elements fused with PPNB to form the Minhata Culture and Yarmukian Culture, which were to spread southwards, beginning the development of the classic mixed farming Mediterranean culture, and from 5600\u00a0BC were associated with the Ghassulian culture of the region, the first Chalcolithic culture of the Levant. This period also witnessed the development of megalithic structures, which continued into the Bronze Age.\nHistorically, the Bedouin engaged in nomadic herding, agriculture and sometimes fishing in the Syrian steppe since 6000 BC. By about 850 BC, a complex network of settlements and camps were established. The earliest Arab tribes emerged from Bedouins.\nCopper Age.\nKish civilization.\nThe Kish civilization or Kish tradition is a concept created by Ignace Gelb and discarded by more recent scholarship, which Gelb placed in what he called the early East Semitic era in Mesopotamia and the Levant, starting in the early 4th millennium BC. The concept encompassed the sites of Ebla and Mari in the Levant, Nagar in the north, and the proto-Akkadian sites of Abu Salabikh and Kish in central Mesopotamia, which constituted the Uri region as it was known to the Sumerians. The Kish civilisation was considered to end with the rise of the Akkadian empire in the 24th century BC.\nBronze Age.\nEarly and middle Bronze Age.\nSome recent scholars dealing with the Syrian part of the Levant during the Bronze Age use Syria-specific subdivision: \"Early/Proto Syrian\" for the Early Bronze Age (3300\u20132000 BC); \"Old Syrian\" for the Middle Bronze Age (2000\u20131550 BC); and \"Middle Syrian\" for the Late Bronze Age (1550\u20131200 BC). \"Neo-Syrian\" corresponds to the Early Iron Age. The Early Syrian period was dominated by the East Semitic-speaking kingdoms of Ebla, Nagar and the Mari. At its greatest extent, Ebla controlled an area roughly half the size of modern Syria, from Ursa'um in the north, to the area around Damascus in the south, and from Phoenicia and the coastal mountains in the west, to Haddu in the east, with more than sixty vassal kingdoms and city-states. Mobile nomadic tribal confederations such as Mardu, Dadanu and Ib'al lived in the steppes to the south of Ebla.\nEbla and Mari were incorporated into the Akkadian Empire by Sargon of Akkad and his successors, until the empire collapsed due to a major climatic event around 2200 BC. This event prompted the influx of nomadic Amorites into Sumer, and correlates with a subsequent influx and settlement expansion in many regions of Syria as well. In the later periods of the Third Dynasty of Ur, immigrating Amorites had become such a force that the king of Ur, Shu-Sin, constructed a wall dubbed \"Repeller of the Amorites\", extending in between the Tigris and Euphrates, to hold them off. The Amorites are depicted in contemporary records as nomadic tribes under chiefs, who forced themselves into lands they needed to graze their herds. Some of the Akkadian literature of this era speaks disparagingly of the Amorites and implies that the urbanized people of Mesopotamia viewed their nomadic and primitive way of life with disgust and contempt. In the Sumerian myth \"Marriage of Martu\", written early in the 2nd millennium BC, a goddess considering marriage to the god of the Amorites is warned:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now listen, their hands are destructive and their features are those of monkeys; (An Amorite) is one who eats what (the Moon-god) Nanna forbids and does not show reverence. They never stop roaming about [...], they are an abomination to the gods' dwellings. Their ideas are confused; they cause only disturbance. (The Amorite) is clothed in sack-leather [...], lives in a tent, exposed to wind and rain, and cannot properly recite prayers. He lives in the mountains and ignores the places of gods, digs up truffles in the foothills, does not know how to bend the knee (in prayer), and eats raw flesh. He has no house during his life, and when he dies he will not be carried to a burial-place. My girlfriend, why would you marry Martu?\nThe Amorites came to politically and culturally dominate much of the ancient Near East for centuries, and founded multiple kingdoms throughout the region including the Old Babylonian Empire. Famed Amorites included Babylonian king Hammurabi and warlord Shamshi-Adad I. After the decline of the Third dynasty of Ur, Amorite rulers gained power in a number of Mesopotamian city-states beginning in the Isin-Larsa period and peaking in the Old Babylonian period.\nIn southern Mesopotamia, Babylon became the major power under Amorite ruler Sumu-la-El and his successor Hammurabi (c. 1792\u20131750 BC). In northern Mesopotamia, the Amorite warlord Shamshi-Adad I conquered much of Assyria and formed the large, though short-lived Kingdom of Upper Mesoptamia. In the Levant, Amorite dynasties ruled various kingdoms of Qatna, Ebla and Yamhad, which also had a significant Hurrian population. Mari was similarly ruled by the Amorite Lim dynasty which belonged to the pastoral Amorites known as the \"Haneans\", who were split into the \"Yaminites\" (sons of the south) and \"Sim'alites\" (sons of the north) tribes. Another Semitic peoples during this period, the Suteans, inhabited Suhum and were in direct conflict with Mari. The Suteans were nomads famous in epic poetry for being fierce nomadic warriors, and like the Habiru, traditionally worked as mercenaries.\nAmorite elements were also to be found in Egypt with the Fourteenth Dynasty of Egypt of the Nile Delta, whose rulers bore distinctly Amorite names such as Yakbim. The Hyksos, who overran Egypt and founded the Fifteenth dynasty, were an amalgam of Levantine elements including the Amorites.\nForeign rule.\nBy the 16th and 15th centuries BC, most of the major urban centers in the Levant had been overran and went into steep decline. Mari was destroyed and reduced in a series of wars and conflicts with Babylon, while Yamhad and Ebla were conquered and completely destroyed by Hittite king Mursili I in about 1600\u00a0BC. In northern Mesopotamia, the era ended with the defeat of the Amorite states by Assyrian kings Puzur-Sin and Adasi between in 1740\u20131735 BC, and the rise of the native Sealand Dynasty further south. In Egypt, Ahmose I expelled the Levantine Hyksos rulers from power, pushing Egypt's borders further into Canaan. The Amorites were eventually absorbed by another West Semitic-speaking people known collectively as the Ahlamu. The Arameans rose to be the prominent group amongst the Ahlamu, and from c. 1200 BC on, the Amorites disappeared from the pages of history.\nBetween 1550\u20131170 BC, much of the Levant was contested between Egypt and the Hittites. The political vacuum paved way for the rise of Mitanni, a mixed Semitic and Hurrian-speaking kingdom whose names of the ruling family bore influence from Indo-Aryan languages. Egyptian rule remained strong over the Canaanite-city states in Palestine, facing resistance mainly from pastoral nomadic groups such as the Shasu. The Shasu grew so powerful that they were able to cut off Egypt's northern routes through Palestine and Transjordan, prompting a vigorous punitive campaigns by Ramesses II and his son Merneptah. After Egyptians abandoned the region, Canaanite city-states came under the mercy of the Shasu and the Habiru, who were seen as 'mighty enemies'. Egyptian control over the southern Levant completely collapsed in the wake of the Late Bronze Age collapse.\nLate Bronze Age collapse.\nBetween c.\u20091200\u20131150 BC, all of these powers suddenly collapsed. Centralized state systems collapsed, and the region was hit by famine. Chaos ensued throughout the region, and many urban centers were burnt to the ground by famine-struck natives and an assortment of raiders known as the Sea Peoples, who eventually settled in the Levant. The Sea Peoples' origins are ambiguous and many theories have proposed them to be Trojans, Sardinians, Achaeans, Sicilians or Lycians.\nUrban centers which survived Hittite and Egyptian expansions in 1600 BC, including Alalakh, Ugarit, Megiddo and Kadesh, were razed to the ground and were never rebuilt. The Hittite empire was destroyed, and its capital Tar\u1e2bunta\u0161\u0161a was razed to the ground. Egypt repelled its attackers with only a major effort, and over the next century shrank to its territorial core, its central authority permanently weakened.\nIron Age.\nDespite the tumultuous beginning of the Iron Age, the period a number of technological innovations spread, most notably iron working and the Phoenician alphabet, which was developed by the Phoenicians around the 11th century\u00a0BC from the Old Canaanite script, possibly a hybrid of Hieroglyphs, Cuneiform and the mysterious Byblos syllabary. The massive destruction at the end of the Bronze Age collapsed most major polities and city-states of the Bronze Age. The early Iron Age in Syria and Mesopotamia saw a dispersal of settlements and ruralization, with the appearance of large numbers of hamlets, villages, and farmsteads.\nNorth.\nFollowing the Late Bronze age collapse, Aramean tribes and kingdoms came to dominate most of present-day Syria and Upper Mesopotamia. The pastoral expansion of the Arameans in upper Mesopotamia quickly brought them into conflict with the Assyrians, whose dominion in upper Mesopotamia consequently came to an end (ca. 1114\u20131056 BC). Aramean infiltration also extended into southern Mesopotamia, where their presence was felt by cities in central Babylonia as early as the 10th century. Some of the major Aramaean kingdoms included Aram-Damascus, Hamath, Sam\u02beal and Aram-Zobah (in Syria); and Bet-Adini, Bet-Bagyan, Bet-Zamani and Bet-Halupe (in upper Mesopotamia). In northern Syria, the dispersal of the Hittites and expansion of Aramaeans gave rise to a conglomeration of West Semitic and Anatolian-speaking kingdoms known as the Neo-Hittite states.\nThe Chaldeans, another West Semitic-speaking group from the Levant, infiltrated Babylonia after the Aramaeans (ca. 940\u2013860 BC), where they were actively involved in rebellion against the Assyrians. Assyrian texts of the 9th century BC further mention the Arabs (\"Aribi\"), who inhabited swaths of land in the Levant and in Babylonian border region in a similar suit to the Aramaeans, their presence seemingly intermingled. In Laqe near Terqa, a mix of Arab and Aramaean tribes settled the lower Khabur valley in 12th century BC, forming a confederation comparable to other tribal leagues of the time.\nAlong the coast of northern Canaan, the Phoenician city-states managed to escape the destruction that ensued in the Late Bronze Age collapse and developed into commercial maritime powers with established colonies across the Mediterranean Sea. These colonies stretched into Sardinia, North Africa, Cyprus, Sicily, Malta and Iberia. One prominent colony, Carthage (from Punic , meaning 'New City'), would eventually become an independent city-state which quarrelled with the Roman Republic over control of the Mediterranean.\nThe Phoenicians transmitted their alphabetic system across the maritime networks, which was eventually adopted and developed into Greek alphabet and Latin alphabet.\nSouth.\nIn the southern Levant, pastoral nomadic tribal groups began to settle down at the start of the 11th century. These included the Israelites in the Cisjordan and the Ammonites, Moabites and Edomites in the Transjordan. The Philistines, a group of Aegean immigrants arrived at the shores of Canaan circa 1175 BC and settled there.\nDuring the seventh century BC, no fewer than eight nations were settled in the southern Levant. These included the Arameans of the kingdom of Geshur; the Samaritans who replaced the Israelite kingdom in Samaria; the Phoenicians in the northern cities and parts of Galilee; the Philistines in the Philistine pentapolis; the three kingdoms of the Transjordan\u2013 Ammon, Moab and Edom; and the Judaeans of Kingdom of Judah.\nForeign rule.\nUnder Assyrians.\nIn the Iron Age, the Levant was characterized by patches of scattered kingdoms and tribal confederations which originated from the same cultural and linguistic milieu. Occasionally, these peoples united against expansion from neighboring regions, notably in the Battle of Qarqar (853 BC) which saw an alliance of Aramaeans, Phoenicians, Israelites, Ammonites and Arabs united against the Assyrians under Shalmaneser III (859\u2013824 BC). The alliance, led by Hadadezer of Aram-Damascus, succeeded in halting the Assyrian army boasting 120,000 soldiers active in Syria.\nBy 843 BC the political situation in central and southern Syria changed radically, after Hazael succeeded Hadadezer as king of Aram-Damascus. The anti-Assyrian alliance dissolved, and former allies of Aram-Damascus turned into enemies. In 842, Hazael invaded the northern parts of the Kingdom of Israel and reportedly penetrated into the coastal planes as far as Asdod, seizing Gilead and eastern Jordan in the process. Hazael survived Assyrian attempts to subjugate Aram-Damascus and also expanded his influence in northern Syria, where he reportedly crossed the Orontes river and seized territories as far as Aleppo. These northern forays allowed Hazael to control much of Syria and Palestine, from Egypt to the Euphrates. Hazael's power far exceeded that of former Aramean kings, and some scholars consider his state to have been a nascent empire.\nThe Assyrians managed to subdue the Levantine states after multiple campaigns that were finalized by Tiglath-Pileser III (745\u2013727 BC). Consolidation of Assyrian rule was followed by numerous revolts throughout the Levant, including division along pro- and anti-Assyrian axes, and intra-Levantine conflict in the Syro-Ephraimite War. The anti-Assyrian axis included Damascus\u2013Tyre\u2013Samaria\u2013the Arabs; and a pro-Assyrian axis which included Arwad, Ashqalon and Gaza joined by Judah, Ammon, Moab and Edom. The anti-Assyrian forces were eventually crushed by 732 BC. Aram-Damascus was annexed and its population was deported; Hamath was razed to the ground and Arameans were prohibited from rebuilding it; the Kingdom of Israel based in Samaria was destroyed and, according to Biblical accounts, the city's population was deported into Assyrian captivity.\nThe fierce resistance and fighting capabilities of the Arameans convinced the Assyrian kings to incorporate them into the army, namely the tribes of Gurru and Itu'u. By the time of Shalmaneser V (727\u2013722 BC), these tribes were an essential part of the empire, and were given the task of securing the empire's peripheries. The Aramaean identity of these tribes probably contributed to the consolidation of Aramaic's prestigious status as the empire's \"lingua franca\".\nUnder Neo-Babylonians.\nAfter the Battle of Carchemish, which effectively annihilated Assyrian resistance and Egyptian intervention, Nebuchadnezzar II besieged Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple (597 BC), starting the period of the Babylonian captivity, which lasted about half a century. Nebuchadnezzar also besieged the Phoenician city of Tyre for 13 years (586\u2013573 BC).\nThe subsequent balance of power was, however, short-lived. In the 550s\u00a0BC, the Achaemenids revolted against the Medes and gained control of their empire, and over the next few decades annexed the realms of Lydia, Damascus, Babylonia, and Egypt into their empire, consolidating control as far as India. This vast kingdom was divided up into various satrapies and governed roughly according to the Assyrian model, but with a far lighter hand. Babylon became one the empire's four capitals, and the lingua franca was Aramaic. Around this time Zoroastrianism became the predominant religion in Persia.\nClassical Age.\nHellenistic rule.\nAchaemenid Empire took over the Levant after 539 BC, but by the 4th century the Achaemenids had fallen into decline. The Phoenicians frequently rebelled against the Persians, who taxed them heavily, in contrast to the Judeans who were granted return from the exile by Cyrus the Great. The campaigns of Xenophon in 401-399 BC illustrated how very vulnerable Persia had become to armies organized along Greek lines. Eventually, such an army under Alexander the Great conquered the Levant in 333-332 BC. However, Alexander did not live long enough to consolidate his realm, and soon after his death in 323 BC, the greater share of the east eventually went to the descendants of Seleucus I Nicator. Seleucus built his capital Seleucia in 305 BC, but the capital was later moved to Antioch in 240 BC.\nAlexander and his Seleucid successors founded many \"poleis\" in Syria, which were then populated by settled troops and locals. The Seleucids also sponsored Greek settlement from Macedon, Athens, Euboea, Thessaly, Crete and Aetolia in military settlements across northern Syria and Anatolia. It was among these communities that Koine Greek formed and became the standard Greek dialect across the Hellenistic world and the Byzantine empire later on. Use of Koine Greek was largely confined to administration and trade while Aramaic remained the lingua franca in much of the rural areas, whereas Hellenistic urban centers were for the most part bilingual. During the period, Hellenistic culture developed as a fusion of ancient Greek culture and local cultures of Syria, Babylonia and Egypt. The Seleucid kings would also adopt the title 'Basileus (King) of Syria'. Hellenistic settlements established by Alexander and his Seleucid successors in the Levant include:\nThe Greek settlers would be used to form the Seleucid phalanx and cavalry units, with picked men put into the kingdom's guards' regiments. While the Seleucids were happy to recruit from smaller groups and outlying parts of the Empire such as Arabs and Jews, as well as Iranians from Central Asia and the people of Asia Minor; they generally eschewed recruiting Syrians (Arameans) and Babylonians. This was presumably from a desire not to train and arm the people who were an overwhelming majority in the trade and governmental centers of the Empire, in Antioch and Babylon, which would have undermined the empire's very existence in case of revolt. However, recruitment policy would become less strict by time of the Roman\u2013Seleucid war (192\u2013188 BC)\nResurgence of local kingdoms.\nThe Seleucids gradually lost their domains in Bactria to the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, and in Iran and Mesopotamia to the rising Parthian Empire. Eventually, this limited Seleucid domains to the Levant, and the power decline would lead to the formation of several breakaway states in the Levant.\nIn the north, Greco-Iranian satrap Ptolemaeus declared himself the king of Commagene in 163 BC, while the Arab Abgarids ruled Osroene independently since 132 BC. The Maccabean Revolt in Palestine inaugurated the Hasmonean kingdom in 140 BC. The Nabataeans further south had maintained their kingdom since the 3rd century BC. This rendered the Seleucids a weak, vulnerable state limited to parts of Syria and Lebanon.\nRoman period.\nThe Romans gained a foothold in the region in 64 BC after permanently defeating the Seleucids and Tigranes. Pompey deposed the last Seleucid king Philip II Philoromaeus, and incorporated Syria into Roman domains. However, the Romans only gradually incorporated local kingdoms into provinces, which gave them considerable autonomy in local affairs. The Herodian Kingdom of Judea replaced the Hasmonians in 37 BC until the full incorporation of Judea as Provincia Iudaea in 44 AD after Herod Agrippa II. Commagene and Osroene were incorporated as Roman provinces in 72 and 214 AD respectively, while Nabatea was incorporated as Arabia Petraea in 106 AD.\nBetween the 1st and 3rd centuries the Levant prospered and flourished, reaching an estimated population of 3.5 to 6 million, which were only later matched by those of the 19th century. Urban centers peaked, and so did population density in the rural settlements. Antioch and Palmyra each reached a peak of 200,000\u2013250,000 inhabitants, while Apamea counted 117,000 'free citizens' in AD 6. Combined with the dependencies and villages as well as slaves, Apamea may have, in fact, counted as high as 500,000. The Syrian Coastal Mountain Range, a marginal hill country, was less densely settled and had a population of around 40\u201350,000. According to Robert Kennedy, Palestine and the Transjordan accounted for roughly 800,000\u20131,200,000 of the population. The first to second centuries saw the emergence of a plethora of religions and philosophical schools. Neoplatonism emerged with Iamblichus and Porphyry, Neopythagorianism with Numenius of Apamea, and Hellenic Judaism with Philo of Alexandria. Christianity initially emerged as a sect of Judaism and finally as an independent religion by the mid-second century. Gnosticism also took significant hold in the region.\nThe region of Palestine or Judea experienced abrupt periods of conflict between Romans and Jews. The First Jewish\u2013Roman War (66\u201373) erupted in 66, resulting in the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple in 70. Province forces were directly engaged in the war; in 66 AD, Cestius Gallus sent the Syrian army, based on Legio X Fretensis and Legio XII Fulminata reinforced by \"vexillationes\" of IV \"Scythica\" and VI \"Ferrata\", to restore order in Judaea and quell the revolt, but suffered a defeat in the Battle of Beth Horon. However, XII \"Fulminata\" fought well in the last part of the war, and supported its commander Vespasian in his successful bid for the imperial throne. Two generations later, the Bar Kokhba revolt (132\u2013136) erupted once again, after which the province Syria Palaestina was created in 132.\nDuring the Crisis of the Third Century, the Sassanids under Shapur I invaded the Levant and captured Roman emperor Valerian in the Battle of Edessa. A Syrian notable of Palmyra, Odaenathus assembled the Palmyrene army and Syrian peasants, and marched north to meet Shapur I. The Palmyrene monarch fell upon the retreating Persian army between Samosata and Zeugma, west of the Euphrates, in late summer 260, defeating and expelling them. After eliminating Roman usurpers in Syria \u2013Balista and Quietus\u2013 in 261, Odaeanathus penetrated the Sassanid province of As\u014drist\u0101n in late 262 and laid siege to the Sassanid capital, Ctesiphon in 263. However, logistical problems meant the siege could not continue for long, and soon after Odaenathus broke the siege and brought numerous prisoners and booty to Rome. After his return, Odaenathus assumed the title of King of Kings of the East (\"Mlk Mlk dy Mdnh\" / \"Rex Regum\"). Odaenathus was succeeded by his son Vaballathus under the regency of his mother Queen Zenobia. In 270, Zenobia detached from Roman authority and declared the Palmyrene Empire, rapidly conquering much of Syria, Egypt, Arabia Petraea and large parts of Asia Minor, reaching present-day Ankara. However, by 273, Zenobia was decisively defeated by Aurelian and his Arab Tanukhid allies in Syria.\nByzantine period.\nFollowing the permanent division of the Roman Empire in 391, the Levantine provinces became part of the Byzantine Empire. In the southern Levant, a newly established foederati were crystallizing, the Ghassanid Arabs. The Ghassanids became a client state of the Byzantines, and served as a bulwark against Sassanid incursions and raids by nomads. With the consolidation of Christianity, Jews had become a minority in southern Levant, remaining a majority only in Southern Judea, Galilee and Golan. Jewish revolts had also become much rarer, mostly with the Jewish revolt against Constantius Gallus (351\u2013352) and Jewish revolt against Heraclius (617). This time the Samaritans, whose population swelled to over a million, insurrected the Samaritan revolts (484\u2013572) against the Byzantines, which killed an estimated 200,000 Samaritans, after the civil uprising of Baba Rabba and his subsequent execution in 328/362.\nThe devastating Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628 ended with Byzantine recapture of the land, but left the empire rather exhausted, which taxed the inhabitants heavily. The Levant became the frontline between the Byzantines and the Persian Sassanids, which devastated the region. The war triggered the displacement of many inhabitants from Syria and Palestine to Egypt, and from there to Carthage and Sicily, although archaeological evidence suggests smooth continuity and little displacement of the overall population.\nMuslim conquest and period.\nEastern Roman control over the Levant lasted until 638 when Arab armies conquered the Levant, after which it became a part of the Rashidun Caliphate and was known as Bil\u0101d ash-Sh\u0101m.\nUnder the Umayyads, the capital was moved to Damascus. However, the Levant did not experience wide-scale Arabian tribal settlement unlike in Iraq, where the focus of Arabian tribal migration was. Archaeological and historical evidence strongly suggest there was smooth population continuity and no large-scale abandonment of major sites and regions of the Levant after the Muslim conquest. Moreover, in contrast to Iran, Iraq and North Africa, where Muslim soldiers established separate garrison cities (\"amsar\"), Muslim troops in the Levant settled alongside locals in pre-existing cities such as Damascus, Homs, Jerusalem and Tiberias. The Umayyads also relied on the native Syrian Arab tribes for their military, who oversaw a recruitment policy that resulted in considerable numbers of tribesmen and frontier peasants filling the ranks of the regular and auxiliary forces. These were Arab tribes who inhabited the Levant before Islam, and included tribes such as Lakhm, Judham, Ghassan, Amilah, Balqayn, Salih and Tanukh. When the Abbasids moved the capital to Baghdad in 750, this exposed the Muslim Arabs to the challenge of the strong and well-articulated identity of Iran, whereas in Damascus, they had only to contend with the numerous parochial and fractured identities of the Levant.\nAbbasid focus on Iraq and Iran neglected the Levant, which in turn experienced a period of frequent uprisings and revolts. Syria became fertile grounds for anti-Abbasid sentiments, in various contrasting pro-Umayyad and pro-Shiite forms. In 841, al-Mubarqa ('the Veiled One') lead a rebellion against the Abbasids in Palestine, declaring himself the Umayyad Sufyani. In 912, a revolt against the Abbasids arose in the Damascus region, this time by an Alid descendant of tenth Shiite Imam Ali al-Hadi. The growing Isma'ili \"dawah\" moved to the town of Salamiyah as its headquarters in 765, binding missionaries over to Iraq, Khuzestan, Yemen, Egypt and Maghreb. From Salamiyah, Isma'ili Imam Abd Allah al-Mahdi Billah moved to Sijilmasa in Morocco in 904, where his missionaries were active in proselytizing Berber tribes, eventually establishing the Fatimid empire by 909.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Settled agriculture marked the Neolithic era, which spread slowly across Europe from southeast to the north and west. The later Neolithic period saw the introduction of early metallurgy and the use of copper-based tools and weapons, and the building of megalithic structures, as exemplified by Stonehenge. During the Indo-European migrations, Europe saw migrations from the east and southeast. The period known as classical antiquity began with the emergence of the city-states of ancient Greece. Later, the Roman Empire came to dominate the entire Mediterranean Basin. The Migration Period of the Germanic people began in the late 4th century AD.\nThe fall of the Western Roman Empire in AD 476 traditionally marks the start of the Middle Ages. While the Eastern Roman Empire would continue for another 1000 years, the former lands of the Western Empire would be fragmented into a number of states. The first great empire of the Middle Ages was the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne, while the Islamic conquest of Iberia established Al-Andalus. The Viking Age saw a second great migration of Norse peoples. Attempts to retake the Levant from the Muslim states that occupied it made the High Middle Ages the age of the Crusades, while the political system of feudalism reached its height. The Late Middle Ages were marked by a large population decline, as Europe faced the bubonic plague, as well as invasions by the Mongol peoples from the Eurasian Steppe. At the end of the Middle Ages, there was a transitional period, known as the Renaissance.\nEarly modern Europe is usually dated to the end of the 15th century. Technological changes such as gunpowder and the printing press changed how warfare was conducted and how knowledge was preserved and disseminated. The Reformation saw the fragmentation of religious thought, leading to religious wars. The Age of Discovery led to colonization, and the exploitation of the people and resources of colonies brought resources and wealth to Western Europe. After 1800, the Industrial Revolution brought capital accumulation and rapid urbanization to Western Europe, while several countries transitioned away from absolutist rule to parliamentary regimes. The Age of Revolution saw long-established political systems overturned. In the 20th century, World War I led to a remaking of the map of Europe as the large empires were broken up into nation states. Lingering political issues would lead to World War II, during which Nazi Germany perpetrated The Holocaust. The subsequent Cold War saw Europe divided by the Iron Curtain into capitalist and communist states, led by the United States and the Soviet Union respectively, and the creation of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.The West's remaining colonial empires were dismantled. The last decades saw the fall of remaining dictatorships in Western Europe and a gradual political integration, which led to the European Community, later the European Union. After the Revolutions of 1989, all European communist states transitioned to capitalism, and in 1991 the Soviet Union came to an end. The 21st century began with most of the former communist states gradually joining the EU. In recent times, Europe has faced the Great Recession, the European migrant crisis, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrehistoric period.\nPaleolithic.\n\"Homo erectus\" migrated from Africa to Europe before the emergence of modern humans. The earliest appearance of anatomically modern people in Europe has been dated to 45,000 BC, referred to as the Early European modern humans. Some locally developed transitional cultures, Uluzzian in Italy and Greece, Altm\u00fchlian in Germany, Szeletian in Central Europe and Ch\u00e2telperronian in the southwest, use clearly Upper Paleolithic technologies at early dates.\nNevertheless, the definitive advance of these technologies is made by the Aurignacian culture, originating in the Levant (Ahmarian) and Hungary (first full Aurignacian). By 35,000 BC, the Aurignacian culture and its technology had extended through most of Europe. The last Neanderthals seem to have been forced to retreat to the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula. Around 29,000 BC a new technology/culture appeared in the western region of Europe: the Gravettian. This culture has been theorised to have come with migrations of people from the Balkans: see the Kozarnika cave.\nAround 16,000 BC, Europe witnessed the appearance of the Magdalenian culture, possibly rooted in the old Gravettian. This culture soon superseded the Solutrean area and the Gravettian of mainly France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Ukraine. The Hamburg culture prevailed in Northern Europe in the 14th and the 13th millennium BC as the Creswellian did shortly after in the British Isles.\nAround 12,500 BC, the W\u00fcrm glaciation ended. Magdalenian culture persisted until c. 10,000 BC, when it quickly evolved into two \"microlithist\" cultures: Azilian (Federmesser), in Spain and southern France, and then Sauveterrian, in southern France and Tardenoisian in Central Europe, while in Northern Europe the Lyngby complex succeeded the Hamburg culture with the influence of the Federmesser group as well.\nNeolithic and Copper Age.\nEvidence of permanent settlement dates from the 8th millennium BC in the Balkans. The Neolithic reached Central Europe in the 6th millennium BC and parts of Northern Europe in the 5th and 4th millenniums BC. The modern indigenous populations of Europe are largely descended from three distinct lineages: Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, a derivative of the Cro-Magnon population, Early European Farmers who migrated from Anatolia during the Neolithic Revolution, and Yamnaya pastoralists who expanded into Europe in the context of the Indo-European expansion. The Indo-European migrations started in Southeast Europe at around c.\u20094200 BC through the areas around the Black sea and the Balkan peninsula. In the next 3000 years the Indo-European languages expanded through Europe.\nAround this time, in the 5th millennium BC the Varna culture evolved. In 4700 \u2013 4200 BC, the Solnitsata town, believed to be the oldest prehistoric town in Europe, flourished.\nAncient period.\nBronze Age.\nThe first well-known literate civilization in Europe was the Minoan civilization that arose on the island of Crete and flourished from approximately the 27th century BC to the 15th century BC.\nThe Minoans were replaced by the Mycenaean civilization which flourished during the period roughly between 1600 BC, when Helladic culture in mainland Greece was transformed under influences from Minoan Crete, and 1100 BC. The major Mycenaean cities were Mycenae and Tiryns in Argolis, Pylos in Messenia, Athens in Attica, Thebes and Orchomenus in Boeotia, and Iolkos in Thessaly. In Crete, the Mycenaeans occupied Knossos. Mycenaean settlement sites also appeared in Epirus, Macedonia, on islands in the Aegean Sea, on the coast of Asia Minor, the Levant, Cyprus and Italy. Mycenaean artefacts have been found well outside the limits of the Mycenean world.\nQuite unlike the Minoans, whose society benefited from trade, the Mycenaeans advanced through conquest. Mycenaean civilization was dominated by a warrior aristocracy. Around 1400 BC, the Mycenaeans extended their control to Crete, the centre of the Minoan civilization. The Mycenaean civilization perished with the collapse of Bronze-Age civilization on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The collapse is commonly attributed to the Dorian invasion, although other theories describing natural disasters and climate change have been advanced. Whatever the causes, the Mycenaean civilization had disappeared after LH III C, when the sites of Mycenae and Tiryns were again destroyed. This end, during the last years of the 12th century BC, occurred after a slow decline of the Mycenaean civilization, which lasted many years before dying out. The beginning of the 11th century BC opened a new context, that of the protogeometric, the beginning of the geometric period, the \"Greek Dark Ages\" of traditional historiography.\nThe Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of technological history that saw the slow spread of ironworking technology from present-day Bulgaria and Romania in the 13th and the 12th centuries BC.\nThe Tumulus culture and the following Urnfield culture of central Europe were part of the origin of the Roman and Greek cultures.\nClassical Antiquity.\nClassical antiquity, also known as the classical era, classical period, classical age, or simply antiquity, is the period of cultural history between the 8th century BC and the 5th century AD comprising the interwoven civilizations of ancient Greece and ancient Rome known together as the Greco-Roman world, centered on the Mediterranean Basin. It is the period during which Greece and Rome flourished and had major influence throughout much of Europe, North Africa, and West Asia.\nAncient Greece.\nThe Hellenic civilisation was a collection of city-states or poleis with different governments and cultures that achieved notable developments in government, philosophy, science, mathematics, politics, sports, theatre and music.\nThe most powerful city-states were Athens, Sparta, Thebes, Corinth, and Syracuse. Athens was a powerful Hellenic city-state and governed itself with an early form of direct democracy invented by Cleisthenes; the citizens of Athens voted on legislation and executive bills themselves. Athens was the home of Socrates, Plato, and the Platonic Academy.\nThe Hellenic city-states established colonies on the shores of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea (Asia Minor, Sicily, and Southern Italy in Magna Graecia). By the late 6th century BC, the Greek city states in Asia Minor had been incorporated into the Persian Empire, while the latter had made territorial gains in the Balkans (such as Macedon, Thrace, Paeonia, etc.) and Eastern Europe proper as well. During the 5th century BC, some of the Greek city states attempted to overthrow Persian rule in the Ionian Revolt, which failed. This sparked the first Persian invasion of mainland Greece. At some point during the ensuing Greco-Persian Wars, namely during the Second Persian invasion of Greece, and precisely after the Battle of Thermopylae and the Battle of Artemisium, almost all of Greece to the north of the Isthmus of Corinth had been overrun by the Persians, but the Greek city states reached a decisive victory at the Battle of Plataea. With the end of the Greco-Persian wars, the Persians were eventually forced to withdraw from their territories in Europe. The Greco-Persian Wars and the victory of the Greek city states directly influenced the entire further course of European history and would set its further tone. Some Greek city-states formed the Delian League to continue fighting Persia, but Athens' position as leader of this league led Sparta to form the rival Peloponnesian League. The Peloponnesian Wars ensued, and the Peloponnesian League was victorious. Subsequently, discontent with Spartan hegemony led to the Corinthian War and the defeat of Sparta at the Battle of Leuctra. At the same time at the north ruled the Thracian Odrysian Kingdom between the 5th century BC and the 1st century AD.\nHellenic infighting left Greek city states vulnerable, and Philip II of Macedon united the Greek city states under his control. The son of Philip II, known as Alexander the Great, invaded neighboring Persia, toppled and incorporated its domains, as well as invading Egypt and going as far off as India, increasing contact with people and cultures in these regions that marked the beginning of the Hellenistic period.\nAfter the death of Alexander the Great, his empire split into multiple kingdoms ruled by his generals, the Diadochi. The Diadochi fought against each other in a series of conflicts called the Wars of the Diadochi. In the beginning of the 2nd century BC, only three major kingdoms remained: the Ptolemaic Egypt, the Seleucid Empire and Macedonia. These kingdoms spread Greek culture to regions as far away as Bactria.\nAncient Rome.\nMuch of Greek learning was assimilated by the nascent Roman state as it expanded outward from Italy, taking advantage of its enemies' inability to unite: the only challenge to Roman ascent came from the Phoenician colony of Carthage, and its defeats in the three Punic Wars marked the start of Roman hegemony. First governed by kings, then as a senatorial republic (the Roman Republic), Rome became an empire at the end of the 1st century BC, under Augustus and his authoritarian successors.\nThe Roman Empire had its centre in the Mediterranean, controlling all the countries on its shores; the northern border was marked by the Rhine and Danube rivers. Under the emperor Trajan (2nd century AD) the empire reached its maximum expansion, controlling approximately of land surface, including Italia, Gallia, Dalmatia, Aquitania, Britannia, Baetica, Hispania, Thrace, Macedonia, Greece, Moesia, Dacia, Pannonia, Egypt, Asia Minor, Cappadocia, Armenia, Caucasus, North Africa, Levant and parts of Mesopotamia. Pax Romana, a period of peace, civilisation and an efficient centralised government in the subject territories ended in the 3rd century, when a series of civil wars undermined Rome's economic and social strength.\nIn the 4th century, the emperors Diocletian and Constantine were able to slow down the process of decline by splitting the empire into a Western part with a capital in Rome and an Eastern part with the capital in Byzantium, or Constantinople (now Istanbul). Constantinople is generally considered to be the center of \"Eastern Orthodox civilization\". Whereas Diocletian severely persecuted Christianity, Constantine declared an official end to state-sponsored persecution of Christians in 313 with the Edict of Milan, thus setting the stage for the Church to become the state church of the Roman Empire in about 380.\nThe Roman Empire had been repeatedly attacked by invading armies from Northern Europe and in 476, Rome finally fell. Romulus Augustus, the last emperor of the Western Roman Empire, surrendered to the Germanic King Odoacer.\nLate Antiquity and Migration Period.\nWhen Emperor Constantine had reconquered Rome under the banner of the cross in 312, he soon afterwards issued the Edict of Milan in 313 (preceded by the Edict of Serdica in 311), declaring the legality of Christianity in the Roman Empire. In addition, Constantine officially shifted the capital of the Roman Empire from Rome to the Greek town of Byzantium, which he renamed Nova Roma \u2013 it was later named Constantinople (\"City of Constantine\").\nTheodosius I, who had made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, would be the last emperor to preside over a united Roman Empire, until his death in 395. The empire was split into two halves: the Western Roman Empire centred in Ravenna, and the Eastern Roman Empire (later to be referred to as the Byzantine Empire) centred in Constantinople. The Roman Empire was repeatedly attacked by Hunnic, Germanic, Slavic and other \"barbarian\" tribes (see: Migration Period), and in 476 finally the Western part fell to the Heruli chieftain Odoacer.\nRoman authority in the Western part of the empire had collapsed, and a power vacuum left in the wake of this collapse; the central organization, institutions, laws and power of Rome had broken down, resulting in many areas being open to invasion by migrating tribes. Over time, feudalism and manorialism arose, providing for division of land and labour, as well as a broad if uneven hierarchy of law and protection. These localised hierarchies were based on the bond of common people to the land on which they worked, and to a lord, who would provide and administer both local law to settle disputes among the peasants, as well as protection from outside invaders.\nThe western provinces soon were to be dominated by three great powers: first, the Franks (Merovingian dynasty) in Francia 481\u2013843 AD, which covered much of present France and Germany; second, the Visigothic kingdom 418\u2013711 AD in the Iberian Peninsula (modern Spain); and third, the Ostrogothic kingdom 493\u2013553 AD in Italy and parts of the western Balkans. The Ostrogoths were later replaced by the Kingdom of the Lombards 568\u2013774 AD. Although these powers covered large territories, they did not have the great resources and bureaucracy of the Roman empire to control regions and localities; more power and responsibilities were left to local lords. On the other hand, it also meant more freedom, particularly in more remote areas.\nIn Italy, Theodoric the Great began the cultural romanisation of the new world he had constructed. He made Ravenna a centre of Romano-Greek culture of art and his court fostered a flowering of literature and philosophy in Latin. In Iberia, King Chindasuinth created the Visigothic Code.\nIn the Eastern part the dominant state was the remaining Eastern Roman Empire.\nIn the feudal system, new princes and kings arose, the most powerful of which was arguably the Frankish ruler Charlemagne. In 800, Charlemagne, reinforced by his massive territorial conquests, was crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III, solidifying his power in western Europe. Charlemagne's reign marked the beginning of a new Germanic Roman Empire in the west, the Holy Roman Empire. Outside his borders, new forces were gathering. The Kievan Rus' were marking out their territory, a Great Moravia was growing, while the Angles and the Saxons were securing their borders.\nFor the duration of the 6th century, the Eastern Roman Empire was embroiled in a series of deadly conflicts, first with the Persian Sassanid Empire (see Roman\u2013Persian Wars), followed by the onslaught of the arising Islamic Caliphate (Rashidun and Umayyad). By 650, the provinces of Egypt, Palestine and Syria were lost to the Muslim forces, followed by Hispania and southern Italy in the 7th and 8th centuries (see Muslim conquests). The Arab invasion from the east was stopped after the intervention of the Bulgarian Empire (see Han Tervel).\nPost-classical and medieval Europe.\nThe Middle Ages are commonly dated from the fall of the Western Roman Empire (or by some scholars, before that) in the 5th century to the beginning of the early modern period in the 16th century marked by the rise of nation states, the division of Western Christianity in the Reformation, the rise of humanism in the Italian Renaissance, and the beginnings of European overseas expansion which allowed for the Columbian Exchange.\nByzantium.\nMany consider Emperor Constantine I (reigned 306\u2013337) to be the first \"Byzantine emperor\". It was he who moved the imperial capital in 324 from Nicomedia to Byzantium, which re-founded as Constantinople, or Nova Roma (\"New Rome\"). The city of Rome itself had not served as the capital since the reign of Diocletian (284\u2013305). Some date the beginnings of the Empire to the reign of Theodosius I (379\u2013395) and Christianity's official supplanting of the pagan Roman religion, or following his death in 395, when the empire was split into two parts, with capitals in Rome and Constantinople. Others place it yet later in 476, when Romulus Augustulus, traditionally considered the last western emperor, was deposed, thus leaving sole imperial authority with the emperor in the Greek East. Others point to the reorganisation of the empire in the time of Heraclius (c. 620) when Latin titles and usages were officially replaced with Greek versions. In any case, the changeover was gradual and by 330, when Constantine inaugurated his new capital, the process of hellenization and increasing Christianisation was already under way. The Empire is generally considered to have ended after the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. The Plague of Justinian was a pandemic that afflicted the Byzantine Empire, including its capital Constantinople, in the years 541\u2013542. It is estimated that the Plague of Justinian killed as many as 100 million people. It caused Europe's population to drop by around 50% between 541 and 700. It also may have contributed to the success of the Muslim conquests. During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was one of the most powerful economic, cultural, and military forces in Europe, and Constantinople was one of the largest and wealthiest cities in Europe.\nEarly Middle Ages.\nThe Early Middle Ages span roughly five centuries from 500 to 1000.\nIn the East and Southeast of Europe new dominant states formed: the Avar Khaganate (567\u2013after 822), Old Great Bulgaria (632\u2013668), the Khazar Khaganate (c. 650\u2013969) and Danube Bulgaria (founded by Asparuh in 680) were constantly rivaling the hegemony of the Byzantine Empire.\nFrom the 7th century Byzantine history was greatly affected by the rise of Islam and the Caliphates. Muslim Arabs first invaded historically Roman territory under Ab\u016b Bakr, first Caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, who entered Roman Syria and Roman Mesopotamia. As the Byzantines and neighboring Sasanids were severely weakened by the time, amongst the most important reason(s) being the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent Byzantine\u2013Sasanian wars, which included the climactic Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628, under Umar, the second Caliph, the Muslims entirely toppled the Sasanid Persian Empire, and decisively conquered Syria and Mesopotamia, as well as Roman Palestine, Roman Egypt, and parts of Asia Minor and Roman North Africa. In the mid 7th century AD, following the Muslim conquest of Persia, Islam penetrated into the Caucasus region, of which parts would later permanently become part of the Russian Empire. This trend, which included the conquests by the invading Muslim forces and by that the spread of Islam as well continued under Umar's successors and under the Umayyad Caliphate, which conquered the rest of Mediterranean North Africa and most of the Iberian Peninsula. Over the next centuries Muslim forces were able to take further European territory, including Cyprus, Malta, Crete, and Sicily and parts of southern Italy.\nThe Muslim conquest of Hispania began when the Moors invaded the Christian Visigothic kingdom of Hispania in 711, under the Berber general Tariq ibn Ziyad. They landed at Gibraltar on 30 April and worked their way northward. Tariq's forces were joined the next year by those of his Arab superior, Musa ibn Nusair. During the eight-year campaign most of the Iberian Peninsula was brought under Muslim rule \u2013 save for small areas in the northwest (Asturias) and largely Basque regions in the Pyrenees. In 711, Visigothic Hispania was weakened because it was immersed in a serious internal crisis caused by a war of succession to the throne. The Muslims took advantage of the crisis within the Hispano-Visigothic society to carry out their conquests. This territory, under the Arab name Al-Andalus, became part of the expanding Umayyad empire.\nThe second siege of Constantinople (717) ended unsuccessfully after the intervention of Tervel of Bulgaria and weakened the Umayyad dynasty and reduced their prestige. In 722 Don Pelayo formed an army of 300 Astur soldiers, to confront Munuza's Muslim troops. In the battle of Covadonga, the Astures defeated the Arab-Moors, who decided to retire. The Christian victory marked the beginning of the Reconquista and the establishment of the Kingdom of Asturias, whose first sovereign was Don Pelayo. The conquerors intended to continue their expansion in Europe and move northeast across the Pyrenees, but were defeated by the Frankish leader Charles Martel at the Battle of Poitiers in 732. The Umayyads were overthrown in 750 by the 'Abb\u0101sids, and, in 756, the Umayyads established an independent emirate in the Iberian Peninsula.\nFeudal Christendom.\nThe Holy Roman Empire emerged around 800, as Charlemagne, King of the Franks and part of the Carolingian dynasty, was crowned by the pope as emperor. His empire based in modern France, the Low Countries and Germany expanded into modern Hungary, Italy, Bohemia, Lower Saxony and Spain. He and his father received substantial help from an alliance with the Pope, who wanted help against the Lombards. His death marked the beginning of the end of the dynasty, which collapsed entirely by 888. The fragmentation of power led to semi-autonomy in the region, and has been defined as a critical starting point for the formation of states in Europe.\nTo the east, Bulgaria was established in 681 and became the first Slavic country. The powerful Bulgarian Empire was the main rival of Byzantium for control of the Balkans for centuries and from the 9th century became the cultural centre of Slavic Europe. The Empire created the Cyrillic script during the 9th century AD, at the Preslav Literary School, and experienced the Golden Age of Bulgarian cultural prosperity during the reign of emperor Simeon I the Great (893\u2013927). Two states, Great Moravia and Kievan Rus', emerged among the Slavic peoples respectively in the 9th century. In the late 9th and 10th centuries, northern and western Europe felt the burgeoning power and influence of the Vikings who raided, traded, conquered and settled swiftly and efficiently with their advanced seagoing vessels such as the longships. The Vikings had left a cultural influence on the Anglo-Saxons and Franks as well as the Scots. The Hungarians pillaged mainland Europe, the Pechenegs raided Bulgaria, Rus States and the Arab states. In the 10th century independent kingdoms were established in Central Europe including Poland and the newly settled Kingdom of Hungary. The Kingdom of Croatia also appeared in the Balkans. The subsequent period, ending around 1000, saw the further growth of feudalism, which weakened the Holy Roman Empire.\nIn eastern Europe, Volga Bulgaria became an Islamic state in 921, after Alm\u0131\u015f I converted to Islam under the missionary efforts of Ahmad ibn Fadlan.\nSlavery in the early medieval period had mostly died out in western Europe by about the year 1000 AD, replaced by serfdom. It lingered longer in England and in peripheral areas linked to the Muslim world, where slavery continued to flourish. Church rules suppressed slavery of Christians. Most historians argue the transition was quite abrupt around 1000, but some see a gradual transition from about 300 to 1000.\nHigh Middle Ages.\nIn 1054, the East\u2013West Schism occurred between the two remaining Christian seats in Rome and Constantinople (modern Istanbul).\nThe High Middle Ages of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries show a rapidly increasing population of Europe, which caused great social and political change from the preceding era. By 1250, the robust population increase greatly benefited the economy, reaching levels it would not see again in some areas until the 19th century.\nFrom about the year 1000 onwards, Western Europe saw the last of the barbarian invasions and became more politically organized. The Vikings had settled in Britain, Ireland, France and elsewhere, whilst Norse Christian kingdoms were developing in their Scandinavian homelands. The Magyars had ceased their expansion in the 10th century, and by the year 1000, the Roman Catholic Apostolic Kingdom of Hungary was recognised in central Europe. With the brief exception of the Mongol invasions, major barbarian incursions ceased.\nBulgarian sovereignty was re-established with the anti-Byzantine uprising of the Bulgarians and Vlachs in 1185. The crusaders invaded the Byzantine Empire, captured Constantinople in 1204 and established their Latin Empire. Kaloyan of Bulgaria defeated Baldwin I, Latin Emperor of Constantinople, in the Battle of Adrianople on 14 April 1205. The reign of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria led to maximum territorial expansion and that of Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria to a Second Golden Age of Bulgarian culture. The Byzantine Empire was fully re-established in 1261.\nIn the 11th century, populations north of the Alps began to settle new lands. Vast forests and marshes of Europe were cleared and cultivated. At the same time settlements moved beyond the traditional boundaries of the Frankish Empire to new frontiers in Europe, beyond the Elbe river, tripling the size of Germany in the process. Crusaders founded European colonies in the Levant, the majority of the Iberian Peninsula was conquered from the Muslims, and the Normans colonised southern Italy, all part of the major population increase and resettlement pattern.\nThe High Middle Ages produced many different forms of intellectual, spiritual and artistic works. The most famous are the great cathedrals as expressions of Gothic architecture, which evolved from Romanesque architecture. This age saw the rise of modern nation-states in Western Europe and the ascent of the famous Italian city-states, such as Florence and Venice. The influential popes of the Catholic Church called volunteer armies from across Europe to a series of Crusades against the Seljuq Turks, who occupied the Holy Land. The rediscovery of the works of Aristotle led Thomas Aquinas and other thinkers to develop the philosophy of Scholasticism.\nHoly wars.\nAfter the East\u2013West Schism, Western Christianity was adopted by the newly created kingdoms of Central Europe: Poland, Hungary and Bohemia. The Roman Catholic Church developed as a major power, leading to conflicts between the Pope and emperor. The geographic reach of the Roman Catholic Church expanded enormously due to the conversions of pagan kings (Scandinavia, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary), the Christian Reconquista of Al-Andalus, and the Crusades. Most of Europe was Roman Catholic in the 15th century.\nEarly signs of the rebirth of civilization in western Europe began to appear in the 11th century as trade started again in Italy, leading to the economic and cultural growth of independent city-states such as Venice and Florence; at the same time, nation-states began to take form in places such as France, England, Spain, and Portugal, although the process of their formation (usually marked by rivalry between the monarchy, the aristocratic feudal lords and the church) actually took several centuries. These new nation-states began writing in their own cultural vernaculars, instead of the traditional Latin. Notable figures of this movement would include Dante Alighieri and Christine de Pizan. The Holy Roman Empire, essentially based in Germany and Italy, further fragmented into a myriad of feudal principalities or small city states, whose subjection to the emperor was only formal.\nThe 14th century, when the Mongol Empire came to power, is often called the \"Age of the Mongols\". Mongol armies expanded westward under the command of Batu Khan. Their western conquests included almost all of Kievan Rus' (save Novgorod, which became a vassal), and the Kipchak-Cuman Confederation. Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland managed to remain sovereign states. Mongolian records indicate that Batu Khan was planning a complete conquest of the remaining European powers, beginning with a winter attack on Austria, Italy and Germany, when he was recalled to Mongolia upon the death of Great Khan \u00d6gedei. Most historians believe only his death prevented the complete conquest of Europe. The areas of Eastern Europe and most of Central Asia that were under direct Mongol rule became known as the Golden Horde. Under Uzbeg Khan, Islam became the official religion of the region in the early 14th century. The invading Mongols, together with their mostly Turkic subjects, were known as Tatars. In Russia, the Tatars ruled the various states of the Rus' through vassalage for over 300 years.\nIn the Northern Europe, Konrad of Masovia gave Che\u0142mno to the Teutonic Knights in 1226 as a base for a Crusade against the Old Prussians and Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Livonian Brothers of the Sword were defeated by the Lithuanians, so in 1237 Gregory IX merged the remainder of the order into the Teutonic Order as the Livonian Order. By the middle of the century, the Teutonic Knights completed their conquest of the Prussians before converting the Lithuanians in the subsequent decades. The order also came into conflict with the Eastern Orthodox Church of the Pskov and Novgorod Republics. In 1240 the Orthodox Novgorod army defeated the Catholic Swedes in the Battle of the Neva, and, two years later, they defeated the Livonian Order in the Battle on the Ice. The Union of Krewo in 1386, bringing two major changes in the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania: conversion to Catholicism and establishment of a dynastic union between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland marked both the greatest territorial expansion of the Grand Duchy and the defeat of the Teutonic Knights in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410.\nLate Middle Ages.\nThe Late Middle Ages spanned around the 14th and late 15th centuries. Around 1300, centuries of European prosperity and growth came to a halt. A series of famines and plagues, such as the Great Famine of 1315\u20131317 and the Black Death, killed people in a matter of days, reducing the population of some areas by half as many survivors fled. Kishlansky reports:\nThe Black Death touched every aspect of life, hastening a process of social, economic, and cultural transformation already underway... Fields were abandoned, workplaces stood idle, international trade was suspended. Traditional bonds of kinship, village, and even religion were broken amid the horrors of death, flight, and failed expectations. \"People cared no more for dead men than we care for dead goats,\" wrote one survivor.\nDepopulation caused labor to become scarcer; the survivors were better paid and peasants could drop some of the burdens of feudalism. There was also social unrest; France and England experienced serious peasant risings including the Jacquerie and the Peasants' Revolt. The unity of the Catholic Church was shattered by the Great Schism. Collectively these events have been called the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages.\nBeginning in the 14th century, the Baltic Sea became one of the most important trade routes. The Hanseatic League, an alliance of trading cities, facilitated the absorption of vast areas of Poland, Lithuania, and Livonia into trade with other European countries. This fed the growth of powerful states in this part of Europe including Poland\u2013Lithuania, Hungary, Bohemia, and Muscovy later on. The conventional end of the Middle Ages is usually associated with the fall of the city of Constantinople and of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. The Turks made the city the capital of their Ottoman Empire, which lasted until 1922 and included Egypt, Syria, and most of the Balkans. The Ottoman wars in Europe marked an essential part of the history of the continent.\nA key 15th-century development was the advent of the movable type of printing press circa 1439 in Mainz, building upon the impetus provided by the prior introduction of paper from China via the Arabs in the High Middle Ages. The adoption of the technology across the continent at dazzling speed for the remaining part of the 15th century would usher a revolution and by 1500 over 200 cities in Europe had presses that printed between 8 and 20\u00a0million books.\nEarly modern Europe.\nThe Early Modern period spans the centuries between the Middle Ages and the Industrial Revolution, roughly from 1500 to 1800, or from the discovery of the New World in 1492 to the French Revolution in 1789. The period is characterised by the rise in importance of science and increasingly rapid technological progress, secularised civic politics, and the nation state. Capitalist economies began their rise, and the early modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the economic theory of mercantilism. As such, the early modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance, in much of the European sphere, of feudalism, serfdom and the power of the Catholic Church. The period includes the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Protestant Reformation, the disastrous Thirty Years' War, the European colonisation of the Americas and the European witch-hunts.\nRenaissance.\nDespite these crises, the 14th century was also a time of great progress within the arts and sciences. A renewed interest in ancient Greek and Roman led to the Italian Renaissance, a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the early modern period. Beginning in Italy, and spreading to the north, west and middle Europe during a cultural lag of some two and a half centuries, its influence affected literature, philosophy, art, politics, science, history, religion, and other aspects of intellectual inquiry. The Humanists saw their repossession of a great past as a Renaissance \u2013 a rebirth of civilization itself. Important political precedents were also set in this period. Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli's political writing in \"The Prince\" influenced later absolutism and realpolitik. Also important were the many patrons who ruled states and used the artistry of the Renaissance as a sign of their power.\nThe Scientific Revolution took place in Europe starting towards the second half of the Renaissance period, with the 1543 Nicolaus Copernicus publication \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\" (\"On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres\") often cited as its beginning.\nExploration and trade.\nToward the end of the period, an era of discovery began. The growth of the Ottoman Empire, culminating in the fall of Constantinople in 1453, cut off trading possibilities with the east. Western Europe was forced to discover new trading routes, as happened with Columbus' travel to the Americas in 1492, and Vasco da Gama's circumnavigation of India and Africa in 1498.\nThe numerous wars did not prevent European states from exploring and conquering wide portions of the world, from Africa to Asia and the newly discovered Americas. In the 15th century, Portugal led the way in geographical exploration along the coast of Africa in search of a maritime route to India, followed by Spain near the close of the 15th century, dividing their exploration of the world according to the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. They were the first states to set up colonies in America and European trading posts (factories) along the shores of Africa and Asia, establishing the first direct European diplomatic contacts with Southeast Asian states in 1511, China in 1513 and Japan in 1542. In 1552, Russian tsar Ivan the Terrible conquered two major Tatar khanates, the Khanate of Kazan and the Astrakhan Khanate. The Yermak's voyage of 1580 led to the annexation of the Tatar Siberian Khanate into Russia, and the Russians would soon after conquer the rest of Siberia, steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries. Oceanic explorations soon followed by France, England and the Netherlands, who explored the Portuguese and Spanish trade routes into the Pacific Ocean, reaching Australia in 1606 and New Zealand in 1642.\nReformation.\nWith the development of the printing press, new ideas spread throughout Europe and challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology. Simultaneously, the Reformation under German Martin Luther questioned Papal authority. The most common dating of the Reformation begins in 1517, when Luther published \"The Ninety-Five Theses\", and concludes in 1648 with the Treaty of Westphalia that ended years of European religious wars.\nDuring this period corruption in the Catholic Church led to a sharp backlash in the Protestant Reformation. It gained many followers especially among princes and kings seeking a stronger state by ending the influence of the Catholic Church. Figures other than Martin Luther began to emerge as well like John Calvin whose Calvinism had influence in many countries and King Henry VIII of England who broke away from the Catholic Church in England and set up the Anglican Church. These religious divisions brought on a wave of wars inspired and driven by religion but also by the ambitious monarchs in Western Europe who were becoming more centralized and powerful.\nThe Protestant Reformation also led to a strong reform movement in the Catholic Church called the Counter-Reformation, which aimed to reduce corruption as well as to improve and strengthen Catholic dogma. Two important groups in the Catholic Church who emerged from this movement were the Jesuits, who helped keep Spain, Portugal, Poland, and other European countries within the Catholic fold, and the Oratorians of Saint Philip Neri, who ministered to the faithful in Rome, restoring their confidence in the Church of Jesus Christ that subsisted substantially in the Church of Rome. Still, the Catholic Church was somewhat weakened by the Reformation, portions of Europe were no longer under its sway and kings in the remaining Catholic countries began to take control of the church institutions within their kingdoms.\nUnlike many European countries at the time, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth was notably tolerant of the Protestant movement, as well the Principality of Transylvania. A degree of tolerance was also displayed in Ottoman Hungary. While still enforcing the predominance of Catholicism, they continued to allow the large religious minorities to maintain their faiths, traditions and customs. The Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth became divided among Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox, Jews and a small Muslim population.\nAnother development was the idea of 'European superiority'. There was a movement by some such as Montaigne that regarded the non-Europeans as a better, more natural and primitive people. Post services were founded all over Europe, which allowed a humanistic interconnected network of intellectuals across Europe, despite religious divisions. However, the Roman Catholic Church banned many leading scientific works; this led to an intellectual advantage for Protestant countries, where the banning of books was regionally organised. Francis Bacon and other advocates of science tried to create unity in Europe by focusing on the unity in nature. In the 15th century, at the end of the Middle Ages, powerful sovereign states were appearing, built by the New Monarchs who were centralising power in France, England, and Spain. On the other hand, the Parliament in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth grew in power, taking legislative rights from the Polish king. The new state power was contested by parliaments in other countries especially England. New kinds of states emerged which were co-operation agreements among territorial rulers, cities, farmer republics and knights.\nMercantilism and colonial expansion.\nThe Iberian kingdoms were able to dominate colonial activity in the 16th century. The Portuguese forged the first global empire in the 15th and 16th century, whilst during the 16th century and the first half of the 17th century, the crown of Castile (and the overarching Hispanic Monarchy, including Portugal from 1580 to 1640) became the most powerful empire in the world. Spanish dominance in America was increasingly challenged by British, French, Dutch and Swedish colonial efforts of the 17th and 18th centuries. New forms of trade and expanding horizons made new forms of government, law and economics necessary.\nColonial expansion continued in the following centuries (with some setbacks, such as successful wars of independence in the British American colonies and then later Haiti, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and others amid European turmoil of the Napoleonic Wars). Spain had control of a large part of North America, all of Central America and a great part of South America, the Caribbean and the Philippines; Britain took the whole of Australia and New Zealand, most of India, and large parts of Africa and North America; France held parts of Canada and India (nearly all of which was lost to Britain in 1763), Indochina, large parts of Africa and the Caribbean islands; the Netherlands gained the East Indies (now Indonesia) and islands in the Caribbean; Portugal obtained Brazil and several territories in Africa and Asia; and later, powers such as Germany, Belgium, Italy and Russia acquired further colonies.\nThis expansion helped the economy of the countries owning them. Trade flourished, because of the minor stability of the empires. By the late 16th century, American silver accounted for one-fifth of Spain's total budget. The French colony of Saint-Domingue was one of richest European colonies in the 18th century, operating on a plantation economy fueled by slave labor. During the period of French rule, cash crops produced in Saint-Domingue comprised thirty percent of total French trade while its sugar exports represented forty percent of the Atlantic market.\nCrisis of the 17th century.\nThe 17th century is typically framed as an era of crisis. Many historians have rejected the idea, while others promote it as an invaluable insight into the warfare, politics, economics, and even art. The Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648) focused attention on the massive horrors that wars could bring to entire populations. The 1640s in particular saw more state breakdowns around the world than any previous or subsequent period. The Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, the largest state in Europe, temporarily disappeared. In addition, there were secessions and upheavals in several parts of the Spanish empire, the world's first global empire. In Britain the entire Stuart monarchy (England, Scotland, Ireland, and its North American colonies) rebelled. Political insurgency and a spate of popular revolts seldom equalled shook the foundations of most states in Europe and Asia. More wars took place around the world in the mid-17th century than in almost any other period of recorded history. Across the Northern Hemisphere, the mid-17th century experienced almost unprecedented death rates.\nAge of absolutism.\nThe \"absolute\" rule of powerful monarchs such as Louis XIV (ruled France 1643\u20131715), Peter the Great (ruled Russia 1682\u20131725), Maria Theresa (ruled Habsburg lands 1740\u20131780) and Frederick the Great (ruled Prussia 1740\u201386), produced powerful centralized states, with strong armies and powerful bureaucracies, all under the control of the king.\nThroughout the early part of this period, capitalism (through mercantilism) was replacing feudalism as the principal form of economic organisation, at least in the western half of Europe. The expanding colonial frontiers resulted in a Commercial Revolution. The period is noted for the rise of modern science and the application of its findings to technological improvements, which animated the Industrial Revolution after 1750.\nThe Reformation had profound effects on the unity of Europe. Not only were nations divided one from another by their religious orientation, but some states were torn apart internally by religious strife, avidly fostered by their external enemies. France suffered this fate in the 16th century in the series of conflicts known as the French Wars of Religion, which ended in the triumph of the Bourbon Dynasty. England settled down under Elizabeth I to a moderate Anglicanism. Much of modern-day Germany was made up of numerous small sovereign states under the theoretical framework of the Holy Roman Empire, which was further divided along internally drawn sectarian lines. The Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth is notable in this time for its religious indifference and general immunity to European religious strife.\nThirty Years' War 1618\u20131648.\nThe Thirty Years' War was fought between 1618 and 1648, across Germany and neighbouring areas, and involved most of the major European powers except England and Russia, involving Catholics versus Protestants for the most part. The major impact of the war was the devastation of entire regions scavenged bare by the foraging armies. Episodes of widespread famine and disease, and the breakup of family life, devastated the population of the German states and, to a lesser extent, the Low Countries, the Crown of Bohemia and northern parts of Italy, while bankrupting many of the regional powers involved. Between one-fourth and one-third of the German population perished from direct military causes or from disease and starvation, as well as postponed births.\nAfter the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the war in favour of nations deciding their own religious allegiance, absolutism became the norm of the continent, while parts of Europe experimented with constitutions foreshadowed by the English Civil War and particularly the Glorious Revolution. European military conflict did not cease, but had less disruptive effects on the lives of Europeans. In the advanced northwest, the Enlightenment gave a philosophical underpinning to the new outlook, and the continued spread of literacy, made possible by the printing press, created new secular forces in thought.\nFrom the Union of Krewo, central and eastern Europe was dominated by Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In the 16th and 17th centuries Central and Eastern Europe was an arena of conflict for domination of the continent between Sweden, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth (involved in series of wars, like Khmelnytsky uprising, Russo-Polish War, the Deluge, etc.) and the Ottoman Empire. This period saw a gradual decline of these three powers which were eventually replaced by new enlightened absolutist monarchies: Russia, Prussia and Austria (the Habsburg monarchy). By the turn of the 19th century they had become new powers, having divided Poland between themselves, with Sweden and Turkey having experienced substantial territorial losses to Russia and Austria respectively as well as pauperisation.\nWar of the Spanish Succession.\nThe War of the Spanish Succession (1701\u20131715) was a major war with France opposed by a coalition of England, the Netherlands, the Habsburg monarchy, and Prussia. Duke of Marlborough commanded the English and Dutch victory at the Battle of Blenheim in 1704. The main issue was whether France under King Louis XIV would take control of Spain's very extensive possessions and thereby become by far the dominant power, or be forced to share power with other major nations. After initial allied successes, the long war produced a military stalemate and ended with the Treaty of Utrecht, which was based on a balance of power in Europe. Historian Russell Weigley argues that the many wars almost never accomplished more than they cost. British historian G. M. Trevelyan argues:\nThat Treaty [of Utrecht], which ushered in the stable and characteristic period of Eighteenth-Century civilization, marked the end of danger to Europe from the old French monarchy, and it marked a change of no less significance to the world at large \u2013 the maritime, commercial and financial supremacy of Great Britain.\nPrussia.\nFrederick the Great, king of Prussia 1740\u201386, modernized the Prussian army, introduced new tactical and strategic concepts, fought mostly successful wars (Silesian Wars, Seven Years' War) and doubled the size of Prussia.\nRussia.\nRussia fought numerous wars to achieve rapid expansion toward the east \u2013 i.e. Siberia, Far East, south, to the Black Sea, and south-east and to central Asia. Russia boasted a large and powerful army, a very large and complex internal bureaucracy, and a splendid court that rivaled Paris and London. However the government was living far beyond its means and seized Church lands, leaving organized religion in a weak condition. Throughout the 18th century Russia remained \"a poor, backward, overwhelmingly agricultural, and illiterate country.\"\nEnlightenment.\nThe \"Enlightenment\" was a powerful, widespread cultural movement of intellectuals beginning in late 17th-century Europe emphasizing the power of reason rather than tradition; it was especially favourable to science (especially Isaac Newton's physics) and hostile to religious orthodoxy (especially of the Catholic Church). It sought to analyze and reform society using reason, to challenge ideas grounded in tradition and faith, and to advance knowledge through the scientific method. It promoted scientific thought, skepticism, and intellectual interchange. The Enlightenment was a revolution in human thought. This new way of thinking was that rational thought begins with clearly stated principles, uses correct logic to arrive at conclusions, tests the conclusions against evidence, and then revises the principles in light of the evidence.\nEnlightenment thinkers opposed superstition. Some Enlightenment thinkers collaborated with Enlightened despots, absolutist rulers who attempted to forcibly impose some of the new ideas about government into practice. The ideas of the Enlightenment exerted significant influence on the culture, politics, and governments of Europe.\nOriginating in the 17th century, it was sparked by philosophers Francis Bacon, Baruch Spinoza, John Locke, Pierre Bayle, Voltaire, Francis Hutcheson, David Hume and physicist Isaac Newton. Ruling princes often endorsed and fostered these figures and even attempted to apply their ideas of government in what was known as enlightened absolutism. The Scientific Revolution is closely tied to the Enlightenment, as its discoveries overturned many traditional concepts and introduced new perspectives on nature and man's place within it. The Enlightenment flourished until about 1790\u20131800, at which point the Enlightenment, with its emphasis on reason, gave way to Romanticism, which placed a new emphasis on emotion; a Counter-Enlightenment began to increase in prominence.\nIn France, Enlightenment was based in the salons and culminated in the great \"Encyclop\u00e9die\" (1751\u201372). These new intellectual strains would spread to urban centres across Europe, notably England, Scotland, the German states, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Italy, Austria, and Spain, as well as Britain's American colonies. The political ideals of the Enlightenment influenced the United States Declaration of Independence, the United States Bill of Rights, the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Constitution of 3 May 1791.\nNorman Davies has argued that Freemasonry was a powerful force on behalf of Liberalism and Enlightenment ideas in Europe, from about 1700 to the 20th century. It expanded rapidly during the Age of Enlightenment, reaching practically every country in Europe. The great enemy of Freemasonry was the Roman Catholic Church, so that in countries with a large Catholic element, such as France, Italy, Austria, Spain and Mexico, much of the ferocity of the political battles involve the confrontation between supporters of the Church versus active Masons. 20th-century totalitarian and revolutionary movements, especially the Fascists and Communists, crushed the Freemasons.\nRevolutions and Imperialism.\nThe \"long 19th century\", from 1789 to 1914 saw the drastic social, political and economic changes initiated by the Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. Following the reorganisation of the political map of Europe at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Europe experienced the rise of Nationalism, the rise of the Russian Empire and the peak of the British Empire, as well as the decline of the Ottoman Empire. Finally, the rise of the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire initiated the course of events that culminated in the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.\nIndustrial Revolution.\nThe Industrial Revolution saw major changes in agriculture, manufacturing, and transport impacted Britain and subsequently spread to the United States and Western Europe. Technological advancements, most notably the utilization of the steam engine, were major catalysts in the industrialisation process. It started in England and Scotland in the mid-18th century with the mechanisation of the textile industries, the development of iron-making techniques and the increased use of coal as the main fuel. Trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of canals, improved roads and railways. The introduction of steam power (fuelled primarily by coal) and powered machinery (mainly in textile manufacturing) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity. \nThe development of all-metal machine tools in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries. The effects spread throughout Western Europe and North America during the 19th century, eventually affecting most of the world.\nDuring and after the Industrial Revolution pervasive poverty existed throughout Europe but at the same time, as the Nineteenth Century progressed, living standards for lower-class Europeans steadily rose, with improvements in wages, housing and diets while working hours fell.\nEra of the French Revolution.\nHistorians R.R. Palmer and Joel Colton argue:\nIn 1789 France fell into revolution, and the world has never since been the same. The French Revolution was by far the most momentous upheaval of the whole revolutionary age. It replaced the \"old regime\" with \"modern society,\" and at its extreme phase became very radical, so much so that all later revolutionary movements have looked back to it as a predecessor to themselves... From the 1760s to 1848, the role of France was decisive.\nThe era of the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic wars was a difficult time for monarchs. Tsar Paul I of Russia was assassinated; King Louis XVI of France was executed, as was his queen Marie Antoinette. Furthermore, kings Charles IV of Spain, Ferdinand VII of Spain and Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden were deposed as were ultimately the Emperor Napoleon and all of the relatives he had installed on various European thrones. King Frederick William III of Prussia and Emperor Francis II of Austria barely clung to their thrones. King George III of Great Britain lost the better part of the First British Empire.\nThe American Revolution (1775\u20131783) was the first successful revolt of a colony against a European power. It rejected aristocracy and established a republican form of government that attracted worldwide attention. The French Revolution (1789\u20131804) was a product of the same democratic forces in the Atlantic World and had an even greater impact. French historian Fran\u00e7ois Aulard says:\nFrom the social point of view, the Revolution consisted in the suppression of what was called the feudal system, in the emancipation of the individual, in greater division of landed property, the abolition of the privileges of noble birth, the establishment of equality, the simplification of life... The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national, for it aimed at benefiting all humanity.\"\nFrench intervention in the American Revolutionary War had nearly bankrupted the state. After repeated failed attempts at financial reform, King Louis XVI had to convene the Estates-General, a representative body of the country made up of three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners. The third estate, joined by members of the other two, declared itself to be a National Assembly and created, in July, the National Constituent Assembly. At the same time the people of Paris revolted, famously storming the Bastille prison on 14 July 1789.\nAt the time the assembly wanted to create a constitutional monarchy, and over the following two years passed various laws including the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the abolition of feudalism, and a fundamental change in the relationship between France and Rome. At first the king agreed with these changes and enjoyed reasonable popularity with the people. As anti-royalism increased along with threat of foreign invasion, the king tried to flee and join France's enemies. He was captured and on 21 January 1793, having been convicted of treason, he was guillotined.\nOn 20 September 1792 the National Convention abolished the monarchy and declared France a republic. Due to the emergency of war, the National Convention created the Committee of Public Safety to act as the country's executive. Under Maximilien de Robespierre, the committee initiated the Reign of Terror, during which up to 40,000 people were executed in Paris, mainly nobles and those convicted by the Revolutionary Tribunal, often on the flimsiest of evidence. Internal tensions at Paris drove the Committee towards increasing assertions of radicalism and increasing suspicions. A few months into this phase, more and more prominent revolutionaries were being sent to the guillotine by Robespierre and his faction, for example Madame Roland and Georges Danton. Elsewhere in the country, counter-revolutionary insurrections were brutally suppressed. The regime was overthrown in the coup of 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794) and Robespierre was executed. The regime which followed ended the Terror and relaxed Robespierre's more extreme policies.\nNapoleon.\nNapoleon Bonaparte was France's most successful general in the Revolutionary wars. In 1799 on 18 Brumaire (9 November) he overthrew the government, replacing it with the Consulate, which he dominated. He gained popularity in France by restoring the Church, keeping taxes low, centralizing power in Paris, and winning glory on the battlefield. In 1804 he crowned himself Emperor. In 1805, Napoleon planned to invade Britain, but a renewed British alliance with Russia and Austria (Third Coalition), forced him to turn his attention towards the continent, while at the same time the French fleet was demolished by the British at the Battle of Trafalgar, ending any plan to invade Britain. On 2 December 1805, Napoleon defeated a numerically superior Austro-Russian army at Austerlitz, forcing Austria's withdrawal from the coalition (see Treaty of Pressburg) and dissolving the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, a Fourth Coalition was set up. On 14 October Napoleon defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, marched through Germany and defeated the Russians on 14 June 1807 at Friedland. The Treaties of Tilsit divided Europe between France and Russia and created the Duchy of Warsaw.\nOn 12 June 1812 Napoleon invaded Russia with a Grande Arm\u00e9e of nearly 700,000 troops. After the measured victories at Smolensk and Borodino Napoleon occupied Moscow, only to find it burned by the retreating Russian army. He was forced to withdraw. On the march back his army was harassed by Cossacks, and suffered disease and starvation. Only 20,000 of his men survived the campaign. By 1813 the tide had begun to turn from Napoleon. Having been defeated by a seven nation army at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813, he was forced to abdicate after the Six Days' Campaign and the occupation of Paris. Under the Treaty of Fontainebleau he was exiled to the island of Elba. He returned to France on 1 March 1815 (see Hundred Days), raised an army, but was finally defeated by a British and Prussian force at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815 and exiled to the small British island of Saint Helena.\nImpact of the French Revolution.\nAndrew Roberts, an English popular historian, finds that the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, from 1793 to 1815, caused 4 million deaths (of whom 1\u00a0million were civilians); 1.4\u00a0million were French.\nOutside France the Revolution had a major impact. Its ideas became widespread. Roberts argues that Napoleon was responsible for key ideas of the modern world, so that, \"meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on-were protected, consolidated, codified, and geographically extended by Napoleon during his 16 years of power.\"\nFurthermore, the French armies in the 1790s and 1800s directly overthrew feudal remains in much of western Europe. They liberalised property laws, ended seigneurial dues, abolished the guilds of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship, legalised divorce, closed the Jewish ghettos and made Jews equal to everyone else. The Inquisition ended as did the Holy Roman Empire. The power of church courts and religious authority was sharply reduced and equality under the law was proclaimed for all men.\nFrance conquered Belgium and turned it into another province of France. It conquered the Netherlands, and made it a client state. It took control of the German areas on the left bank of the Rhine River and set up a puppet Confederation of the Rhine. It conquered Switzerland and most of Italy, setting up a series of puppet states. The result was glory and an infusion of much needed money from the conquered lands. However the enemies of France, led by Britain, formed a Second Coalition in 1799 (with Britain joined by Russia, the Ottoman Empire and Austria). It scored a series of victories that rolled back French successes, and trapped the French Army in Egypt. Napoleon slipped through the British blockade in October 1799, returning to Paris, where he overthrew the government and made himself the ruler.\nNapoleon conquered most of Italy in the name of the French Revolution in 1797\u201399. He split up Austria's holdings and set up a series of new republics, complete with new codes of law and abolition of feudal privileges. Napoleon's Cisalpine Republic was centered on Milan; Genoa became a republic; the Roman Republic was formed as well as the small Ligurian Republic around Genoa. The Neapolitan Republic was formed around Naples, but it lasted only five months. He later formed the Kingdom of Italy, with his brother as King. In addition, France turned the Netherlands into the Batavian Republic, and Switzerland into the Helvetic Republic. All these new countries were satellites of France, and had to pay large subsidies to Paris, as well as provide military support for Napoleon's wars. Their political and administrative systems were modernized, the metric system introduced, and trade barriers reduced. Jewish ghettos were abolished. Belgium and Piedmont became integral parts of France.\nMost of the new nations were abolished and returned to prewar owners in 1814. However, Artz emphasizes the benefits the Italians gained from the French Revolution:\nFor nearly two decades the Italians had excellent codes of law, a fair system of taxation, a better economic situation, and more religious and intellectual toleration than they had known for centuries... Everywhere old physical, economic, and intellectual barriers had been thrown down and the Italians had begun to be aware of a common nationality.\nLikewise in Switzerland the long-term impact of the French Revolution has been assessed by Martin:\nIt proclaimed the equality of citizens before the law, equality of languages, freedom of thought and faith; it created a Swiss citizenship, basis of our modern nationality, and the separation of powers, of which the old regime had no conception; it suppressed internal tariffs and other economic restraints; it unified weights and measures, reformed civil and penal law, authorized mixed marriages (between Catholics and Protestants), suppressed torture and improved justice; it developed education and public works.\nThe greatest impact came in France itself. In addition to effects similar to those in Italy and Switzerland, France saw the introduction of the principle of legal equality, and the downgrading of the once powerful and rich Catholic Church. Power became centralized in Paris, with its strong bureaucracy and an army supplied by conscripting all young men. French politics were permanently polarized \u2013 new names were given, \"left\" and \"right\" for the supporters and opponents of the principles of the Revolution.\nReligion.\nBy the 19th century, governments increasingly took over traditional religious roles, paying much more attention to efficiency and uniformity than to religiosity. Secular bodies took control of education away from the churches, abolished taxes and tithes for the support of established religions, and excluded bishops from the upper houses. Secular laws increasingly regulated marriage and divorce, and maintaining birth and death registers became the duty of local officials. Although the numerous religious denominations in the United States founded many colleges and universities, that was almost exclusively a state function across Europe. Imperial powers protected Christian missionaries in African and Asian colonies. In France and other largely Catholic nations, anti-clerical political movements tried to reduce the role of the Catholic Church. Likewise briefly in Germany in the 1870s there was a fierce Kulturkampf (culture war) against Catholics, but the Catholics successfully fought back. The Catholic Church concentrated more power in the papacy and fought against secularism and socialism. It sponsored devotional reforms that gained wide support among the churchgoers.\nThe rise of Nations.\nThe political development of nationalism and the push for popular sovereignty culminated with the ethnic/national revolutions of Europe. During the 19th century nationalism became one of the most significant political and social forces in history; it is typically listed among the top causes of World War I. Most European states had become constitutional monarchies by 1871, and Germany and Italy merged many small city-states to become united nation-states. Germany in particular increasingly dominated the continent in economics and political power. Meanwhile, on a global scale, Great Britain, with its far-flung British Empire, unmatched Royal Navy, and powerful bankers, became the world's first global power. The sun never set on its territories, while an informal empire operated through British financiers, entrepreneurs, traders and engineers who established operations in many countries, and largely dominated Latin America. The British were especially famous for financing and constructing railways around the world.\nNapoleon's conquests of the German and Italian states around 1800\u20131806 played a major role in stimulating nationalism and demand for national unity.\nGermany.\nIn the German states east of Prussia Napoleon abolished many of the old or medieval relics, such as dissolving the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. He imposed rational legal systems and his organization of the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 promoted a feeling of German nationalism. In the 1860s it was Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck who achieved German unification in 1870 after the many smaller states followed Prussia's leadership in wars against Denmark, Austria and France.\nItaly.\nItalian nationalism emerged in the 19th century and was the driving force for Italian unification or the \"Risorgimento\". It was the political and intellectual movement that consolidated different states of the Italian Peninsula into the single state of the Kingdom of Italy in 1860. The memory of the Risorgimento is central to both Italian nationalism and Italian historiography.\nSerbia.\nFor centuries the Orthodox Christian Serbs were ruled by the Muslim-controlled Ottoman Empire. The success of the Serbian revolution (1804\u20131817) against Ottoman rule in 1817 marked the foundation of modern Principality of Serbia. It achieved \"de facto\" independence in 1867 and finally gained recognition in the Berlin Congress of 1878. The Serbs developed a larger vision for nationalism in Pan-Slavism and with Russian support sought to pull the other Slavs out of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Austria, with German backing, tried to crush Serbia in 1914 but Russia intervened, thus igniting the First World War in which Austria dissolved into nation states.\nIn 1918, the region of Vojvodina proclaimed its secession from Austria-Hungary to unite with the pan-Slavic State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs; the Kingdom of Serbia joined the union on 1 December 1918, and the country was named Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. It was renamed Yugoslavia, which was never able to tame the multiple nationalities and religions and it flew apart in civil war in the 1990s.\nGreece.\nThe Greek drive for independence from the Ottoman Empire inspired supporters across Christian Europe, especially in Britain. France, Russia and Britain intervened to make this nationalist dream become reality with the Greek War of Independence (1821-1829/1830).\nBulgaria.\nBulgarian modern nationalism emerged under Ottoman rule in the late 18th and early 19th century. An autonomous Bulgarian Exarchate was established in 1870/1872 for the diocese of Bulgaria as well as for those, wherein at least two-thirds of Orthodox Christians were willing to join it. The April Uprising in 1876 indirectly resulted in the re-establishment of Bulgaria in 1878.\nPoland.\nIn the 1790s, Germany, Russia and Austria partitioned Poland. Napoleon set up the Duchy of Warsaw, igniting a spirit of Polish nationalism. Russia took it over in 1815 as Congress Poland with the tsar as King of Poland. Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted in 1830 and 1863\u201364 but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to Russify the Polish language, culture and religion. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to reestablish an independent Second Polish Republic, which survived until 1939. Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the Kulturkampf of the 1870s. The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new Centre Party, and defeated Bismarck politically. He responded by stopping the harassment and cooperating with the Centre Party.\nSpain.\nAfter the War of the Spanish Succession, the assimilation of the Crown of Aragon by the Castilian Crown through the Decrees of Nova planta was the first step in the creation of the Spanish nation state, through the imposition of the political and cultural characteristics of the dominant ethnic group, in this case the Castilians, over those of other ethnic groups, who became national minorities to be assimilated. Since the political unification of 1714, Spanish assimilation policies towards Catalan-speaking territories (Catalonia, Valencia, the Balearic Islands, part of Aragon) and other national minorities have been a historical constant. The nationalization process accelerated in the 19th century, in parallel to the origin of Spanish nationalism, the social, political and ideological movement that tried to shape a Spanish national identity based on the Castilian model, in conflict with the other historical nations of the State. These nationalist policies, sometimes very aggressive, and still in force, are the seed of repeated territorial conflicts within the State.\nEducation.\nAn important component of nationalism was the study of the nation's heritage, emphasizing the national language and literary culture. This stimulated, and was in turn strongly supported by, the emergence of national educational systems. Latin gave way to the national language, and compulsory education, with strong support from modernizers and the media, became standard in Germany and eventually other West European nations. Voting reforms extended the franchise. Every country developed a sense of national origins \u2013 the historical accuracy was less important than the motivation toward patriotism. Universal compulsory education was extended to girls at the elementary level. By the 1890s, strong movements emerged in some countries, including France, Germany and the United States, to extend compulsory education to the secondary level.\nIdeological coalitions.\nAfter the defeat of revolutionary France, the great powers tried to restore the situation which existed before 1789. The 1815 Congress of Vienna produced a peaceful balance of power among the European empires, known as the Metternich system. The powerbase of their support was the aristocracy. However, their reactionary efforts were unable to stop the spread of revolutionary movements: the middle classes had been deeply influenced by the ideals of the French revolution, and the Industrial Revolution brought important economical and social changes.\nRadical intellectuals looked to the working classes for a base for socialist, communist and anarchistic ideas. Widely influential was the 1848 \"Communist Manifesto\" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.\nThe middle classes and businessmen promoted liberalism, free trade and capitalism. Aristocratic elements concentrated in government service, the military and the established churches. Nationalist movements (in Germany, Italy, Poland, Hungary, and elsewhere) sought national unification and/or liberation from foreign rule. As a result, the period between 1815 and 1871 saw a large number of revolutionary attempts and independence wars. Greece successfully revolted against Ottoman rule in the 1820s.\nFrance under Napoleon III.\nNapoleon III, nephew of Napoleon I, parlayed his famous name and to widespread popularity across France. He returned from exile in 1848, promising to stabilize the chaotic political situation. He was elected president and maneuvered successfully to name himself Emperor, a move approved later by a large majority of the French electorate. The first part of his Imperial term brought many important reforms, facilitated by Napoleon's control of the lawmaking body, the government, and the French Armed Forces. Hundreds of old Republican leaders were arrested and deported. Napoleon controlled the media and censored the news. In compensation for the loss of freedom, Napoleon gave the people new hospitals and asylums, beautified and modernized Paris, and built a modern railroad and transportation system that dramatically improved commerce. The economy grew, but industrialization was not as rapid as Britain, and France depended largely on small family-oriented firms as opposed to the large companies that were emerging in the United States and Germany. France was on the winning side in the Crimean War (1854\u201356), but after 1858 Napoleon's foreign-policy was less and less successful. Foreign-policy blunders finally destroyed his reign in 1870\u201371. His empire collapsed after being defeated in the Franco-Prussian War.\nFrance became a republic, but until the 1880s there was a strong popular demand for monarchy. Hostility to the Catholic Church became a major issue, as France battle between secular and religious forces well into the 20th century, with the secular elements usually more successful. The French Third Republic emerged in 1871.\nBismarck's Germany.\nFrom his base in Prussia, Otto von Bismarck in the 1860s engineered a series of short, decisive wars, that unified most of the German states (excluding Austria) into a powerful German Empire. By 1871 he used balance of power diplomacy to preserve Germany's new role and keep Europe at peace. The new German Empire industrialized rapidly and challenged Britain for economic leadership. Bismarck was removed from office in 1890 by an aggressive young Kaiser Wilhelm II, who pursued a disruptive foreign policy that polarized Europe into rival camps. These rival camps went to war with each other in 1914.\nAustrian and Russian empires.\nThe power of nationalism to create new states was irresistible in the 19th century, and the process could lead to collapse in the absence of a strong nationalism. Austria-Hungary had the advantage of size and a large army, but multiple disadvantages: rivals on four sides, unstable finances, a fragmented population, a thin industrial base, and minimal naval resources. It did have the advantage of good diplomats, typified by Metternich. They employed a grand strategy for survival that balanced out different forces, set up buffer zones, and kept the Hapsburg empire going despite wars with the Ottomans, Frederick the Great, Napoleon and Bismarck, until the First World War. The Empire overnight disintegrated into multiple states based on ethnic nationalism and the principle of self-determination.\nCatherine the Great's reforms caused the Russian Empire to develop into a major European power. In the subsequent decades, Russia expanded in a variety of directions. Like the Austrian empire, the Russian empire brought together a multitude of languages and cultures, so that its military defeat in the First World War led to multiple splits that created independent Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Poland, and briefly independent Ukraine, Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. Russia had a significant impact on the Balkans, Caucasus, and their peoples, including 12 Russo-Turkish wars.\nEmigration.\nThere was mass European emigration to the Americas, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand in the 19th and 20th centuries, as a result of a dramatic demographic transition in 19th-century Europe, subsequent wars and political changes on the continent. From the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 to the end of World War I in 1918, millions of Europeans emigrated. Of these, 71% went to North America, 21% to Central and South America and 7% to Australia. About 11\u00a0million of these people went to Latin America, of whom 38% were Italians, 28% were Spaniards and 11% were Portuguese.\nImperialism.\nColonial empires were the product of the European Age of Discovery from the 15th century. The initial impulse behind these dispersed maritime empires and those that followed was trade. Both the Portuguese Empire and Spanish Empire quickly grew into the first global political and economic systems with territories spread around the world.\nSubsequent major European colonial empires included the French, Dutch, and British. The latter, consolidated during the period of British maritime hegemony in the 19th century, became the largest empire in history because of the improved ocean transportation technologies of the time as well as electronic communication. At its height in 1920, the British Empire covered a quarter of the Earth's land area and comprised a quarter of its population. Other European countries, such as Belgium, Germany, and Italy, pursued colonial empires as well (mostly in Africa), but they were smaller. Russia built its Russian Empire through conquest by land in Eastern Europe, and Asia.\nBy the mid-19th century, the Ottoman Empire had declined. This instigated the Crimean War in 1854 and began a tenser period of minor clashes among the globe-spanning empires of Europe. In the second half of the 19th century, the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Kingdom of Prussia carried out a series of wars that resulted in the creation of Italy and Germany as nation-states, significantly changing the balance of power in Europe. From 1870, Otto von Bismarck engineered a German hegemony that put France in a critical situation. It slowly rebuilt its relationships, seeking alliances with Russia and Britain to control the growing power of Germany. In this way, two opposing sides \u2013 the Triple Alliance of 1882 (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy) and the Triple Entente of 1907 (Britain, France and Russia) \u2013 formed in Europe, escalating military forces and alliances.\nBelle \u00c9poque (1871\u20131914).\nThe years between the Franco-Prussian War and World War I were characterised by unusual political stability in Western and Central Europe. Although tensions between France and Germany persisted as a result of the French loss of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany in 1871, a series of diplomatic conferences managed to mediate disputes that threatened the general peace: the Congress of Berlin in 1878, the Berlin Congo Conference in 1884, and the Algeciras Conference in 1906. Indeed, for many Europeans during the Belle \u00c9poque, transnational, class-based affiliations were as important as national identities, particularly among aristocrats. An upper-class gentleman could travel through much of Western Europe without a passport and even reside abroad with minimal bureaucratic regulation.\nThe Belle \u00c9poque was an era of great scientific and technological advancement in Europe and the world in general. Inventions of the Second Industrial Revolution that became generally common in this era include the perfection of lightly sprung, noiseless carriages in a multitude of new fashionable forms, which were superseded towards the end of the era by the automobile, which was for its first decade a luxurious experiment for the well-heeled. French automobile manufacturers such as Peugeot were already pioneers in carriage manufacturing. Edouard Michelin invented removable pneumatic tires for bicycles and automobiles in the 1890s. The scooter and moped are also Belle \u00c9poque inventions.\n1914\u20131945: two world wars.\nWorld War I.\nAfter the relative peace of most of the 19th century, the rivalry between European powers, compounded by rising nationalism among ethnic groups, exploded in 1914, when World War I started. Over 65 million European soldiers were mobilised from 1914 to 1918; 20\u00a0million soldiers and civilians died. On one side were Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria (the Central Powers/Triple Alliance), while on the other side stood Serbia and the \"Triple Entente\"(France, Britain and Russia), which were joined by Italy in 1915, Romania in 1916 and the United States in 1917. The Western Front involved especially brutal combat without any territorial gains by either side. Single battles like Verdun and the Somme killed hundreds of thousands. Czarist Russia collapsed in the February Revolution of 1917 and Germany claimed victory on the Eastern Front. After eight months of liberal rule, the October Revolution brought Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks to power, leading to the creation of the Soviet Union. With American entry into the war in 1917, and the failure of Germany's spring 1918 offensive, Germany had run out of manpower. Germany's allies, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, surrendered and dissolved, followed by Germany on 11 November 1918.\nThe world war was settled by the victors at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919. The major decisions were the creation of the League of Nations; peace treaties with defeated enemies, most notably the Treaty of Versailles with Germany; the awarding of German and Ottoman overseas possessions as \"mandates\", chiefly to Britain and France; and the drawing of new national boundaries to better reflect the forces of nationalism. Multiple nations were required to sign minority rights treaties. The Treaty of Versailles itself weakened Germany's military power and placed full blame for the war and costly reparations on its shoulders \u2013 the humiliation and resentment in Germany was probably one of the causes of Nazi success and indirectly a cause of World War II.\nInterwar period.\nIn the Treaty of Versailles (1919) the winners recognised the new states (Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, Yugoslavia, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) created in central Europe from the defunct German, Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires, based on national (ethnic) self-determination. It was a peaceful era with a few small wars before 1922 such as the Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War (1917\u20131921) and the Polish\u2013Soviet War (1919\u20131921). Prosperity was widespread, and the major cities sponsored a youth culture called the \"Roaring Twenties\" or \"Jazz Age\".\nThe Allied victory in the First World War seemed to mark the triumph of liberalism. Historian Martin Blinkhorn argues that the liberal themes were ascendant in terms of \"cultural pluralism, religious and ethnic toleration, national self-determination, free-market economics, representative and responsible government, free trade, unionism, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes through a new body, the League of Nations.\" However, as early as 1917, the emerging liberal order was being challenged by the new communist movement. Communist revolts were beaten back everywhere else, but succeeded in Russia.\nItaly adopted an authoritarian ideology known as fascism in 1922. Authoritarian regimes replaced democracy in the 1930s in Nazi Germany, Portugal, Austria, Poland, Greece, the Baltic countries and Francoist Spain. By 1940, there were only four liberal democracies left on the European continent: France, Finland, Switzerland and Sweden.\nGreat Depression: 1929\u201339.\nAfter the Wall Street crash of 1929, most of the world sank into a Great Depression; prices and profits fell and unemployment soared. The worst hit sectors included heavy industry, export-oriented agriculture, mining and lumbering, and construction. World trade fell by two-thirds.\nIn most of Europe, many nations turned to dictators and authoritarian regimes. The most momentous change of government came with Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933. The main institution that was meant to bring stability was the League of Nations, created in 1919. However the League failed to resolve any major crises, undermined by the bellicosity of Nazi Germany, the Empire of Japan, the Soviet Union and Fascist Italy, as well as the lack of participation by the United States. By 1937 it was largely ignored.\nItaly conquered Ethiopia in 1931. The Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131939) was won by the rebels (the Nationalist faction), led by Francisco Franco. The civil war did not escalate into a larger conflict, but did become a worldwide ideological battleground that pitted the left, the communist movement and many liberals against Catholics, conservatives, and fascists. Britain, France and the US remained neutral. Worldwide there was a decline in pacifism and a growing sense that another world war was imminent.\nWorld War II.\nIn 1938 Adolf Hitler annexed the Sudetenland. In the Munich Agreement, Britain and France adopted a policy of appeasement, but Germany subsequently took over the rest of Czechoslovakia. After allying with Japan in the Anti-Comintern Pact and then also with Benito Mussolini's Italy in the \"Pact of Steel\", and finally signing a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union in August 1939, Hitler launched the Second World War on 1 September 1939 by attacking Poland. Britain and France declared war on Germany, but there was little fighting during the \"Phoney War\" period. War began in earnest in spring 1940 with the successful Blitzkrieg conquests of Denmark, Norway, the Low Countries, and France. Britain defeated Germany's air attacks in the Battle of Britain. Hitler's goal was to control Eastern Europe but the attack on the Soviet Union was delayed until June 1941 and the Wehrmacht was stopped close to Moscow in December 1941.\nOver the next year the Germans started to suffer a series of defeats. War raged between the Axis Powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan) and the Allied Forces (British Empire, Soviet Union, and the United States). The Allied Forces won in North Africa, invaded Italy in 1943, and recaptured France in 1944. In 1945 Germany itself was invaded from the east by the Soviet Union and from the west by the other Allies. As the Red Army conquered the Reichstag in the Battle of Berlin, Hitler committed suicide and Germany surrendered. World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, causing between 50 and 80 million deaths, the majority of whom were civilians (approximately 38 to 55 million).\nThis period was also marked by systematic genocide. In 1942\u201345, separately from the war-related deaths, the Nazis killed over 11 million civilians identified through IBM-enabled censuses, including the majority of the Jews and Gypsies of Europe, millions of Polish and Soviet Slavs, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, disabled people, and political enemies. Meanwhile, in the 1930s the Soviet system of forced labour, expulsions and allegedly engineered famine had a similar death toll. Millions of civilians were affected by forced population transfers.\nCold War era.\nThe world wars ended the pre-eminent position of Britain, France and Germany in Europe and the world. At the Yalta Conference, Europe was divided into spheres of influence between the victors of World War II, and soon became the principal zone of contention in the Cold War between the Western countries and the Communist bloc. The United States and the majority of European liberal democracies established the NATO military alliance. Later, the Soviet Union and its satellites in 1955 established the Warsaw Pact. The Warsaw Pact had a much larger ground force, but the American-French-British nuclear umbrellas protected NATO.\nCommunist states were imposed by the Red Army in the East, while parliamentary democracy became dominant in the West. Most historians point to its success as the product of exhaustion with war and dictatorship, and the promise of continued economic prosperity.\nEconomic recovery.\nThe United States gave away about $20\u00a0billion in Marshall Plan grants and other funding to Western Europe, 1945 to 1951. Historian Michael J. Hogan argues that American aid was critical in stabilizing the economy and politics of Western Europe. It brought in modern management that dramatically increased productivity, and encouraged cooperation between labor and management, and among states. Local Communist parties were opposed, and they lost prestige and influence and a role in government. In strategic terms, says Hogan, the Marshall Plan strengthened the West against the possibility of a communist invasion or political takeover. However, the Marshall Plan's role in the rapid recovery has been debated. Most reject the idea that it only miraculously revived Europe, since the evidence shows that a general recovery was already under way. Economic historians Bradford De Long and Barry Eichengreen conclude:\nIt was not large enough to have significantly accelerated recovery by financing investment, aiding the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure, or easing commodity bottlenecks. We argue, however, that the Marshall Plan did play a major role in setting the stage for post-World War II Western Europe's rapid growth. The conditions attached to Marshall Plan aid pushed European political economy in a direction that left its post World War II \"mixed economies\" with more \"market\" and less \"controls\" in the mix.\nThe Soviet Union concentrated on its own recovery. It seized and transferred most of Germany's industrial plants and it exacted war reparations from East Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. It used trading arrangements deliberately designed to favor the Soviet Union. Moscow controlled the Communist parties that ruled the satellite states. Historian Mark Kramer concludes:\nThe net outflow of resources from eastern Europe to the Soviet Union was approximately $15 billion to $20 billion in the first decade after World War II, an amount roughly equal to the total aid provided by the United States to western Europe under the Marshall Plan.\nLooking at the half century after the war historian Walter Lacquer concluded:\n\"The postwar generations of European elites aimed to create more democratic societies. They wanted to reduce the extremes of wealth and poverty and provide essential social services in a way that prewar generations had not. They had had quite enough of unrest and conflict. For decades many Continental societies had more or less achieved these aims and had every reason to be proud of their progress. Europe was quiet and civilized. Europe's success was based on recent painful experience: the horrors of two world wars; the lessons of dictatorship; the experiences of fascism and communism. Above all, it was based on a feeling of European identity and common values \u2013 or so it appeared at the time.\"\nThe post-war period witnessed a significant rise in the standard of living of the Western European working class.\nWestern Europe's industrial nations in the 1970s were hit by a global economic crisis. Causes included obsolescent heavy industry, sudden high energy prices which caused sharp inflation, inefficient nationalized railways and heavy industries, lagging computer technology, high government deficits and growing unrest led by militant labour unions. Germany and Sweden sought to create a social consensus behind a gradual restructuring. Germany's efforts proved highly successful. In Britain under the premiership of Margaret Thatcher, the solution was shock therapy, high interest rates, austerity, and selling off inefficient corporations as well as the public housing. One result was escalating social tensions in Britain. Thatcher eventually defeated her opponents and radically changed the British economy, but controversy persisted.\nRecent history.\nWestern Europe began economic and then political integration, with the aim to unite the region and defend it. This process included organisations such as the European Coal and Steel Community and the Council of Europe. The Solidarno\u015b\u0107 movement in the 1980s weakened the Communist government in Poland. At the time the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev initiated perestroika and glasnost, which weakened Soviet influence in Europe. In 1989 after the Pan-European Picnic the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall came down and Communist governments outside the Soviet Union were deposed. In 1990 the Federal Republic of Germany absorbed East Germany. In 1991 the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Moscow collapsed, ending the USSR, which split into fifteen independent states. The most violent dissolution happened in Yugoslavia. Four out of six Yugoslav republics declared independence and for most of them a violent war ensued, in some parts lasting until 1995. In 2006 Montenegro seceded and became an independent state. Kosovo's government unilaterally declared independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008.\nThe European Economic Community pushed for closer integration, co-operation in foreign and home affairs, and started to increase its membership into the neutral and former communist countries. In 1993, the Maastricht Treaty established the European Union, succeeding the EEC. The neutral countries of Austria, Finland and Sweden acceded to the EU, and those that did not join were tied into the EU's economic market via the European Economic Area. These countries also entered the Schengen Agreement which lifted border controls between member states. The \"euro\" was created in 1999 and replaced all previous currencies in participating states in 2002, forming the \"eurozone\".\nThe EU did not participate in the Yugoslav Wars, and was divided on supporting the United States in the 2003\u20132011 Iraq War. NATO was part of the war in Afghanistan, but at a much lower level of involvement than the United States.\nIn the post\u2013Cold War era, NATO and the EU have been gradually admitting most of the former members of the Warsaw Pact. In 2004, the EU gained 10 new members. (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, which had been part of the Soviet Union; Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia, five former-communist countries; Malta, and the divided island of Cyprus.) These were followed by Bulgaria and Romania in 2007. Russia's regime interpreted these expansions as violations against NATO's promise to not expand \"one inch to the east\" in 1990. Russia engaged in bilateral disputes about gas supplies with Belarus and Ukraine which endangered the European supply, and engaged in a war with Georgia in 2008.\nPublic opinion in the EU turned against enlargement, partially due to what was seen as over-eager expansion including Turkey gaining candidate status. The European Constitution was rejected in France and the Netherlands, and then (as the Treaty of Lisbon) in Ireland, although a second vote passed in Ireland in 2009.\nThe 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession affected Europe, and government responded with austerity. Limited ability of the smaller EU nations (most notably Greece) to handle their debts led to social unrest including the anti-austerity movement, government liquidation, and financial insolvency. In May 2010, the German parliament agreed to loan 22.4\u00a0billion euros to Greece over three years, with the stipulation that Greece follow strict austerity measures. See European sovereign-debt crisis.\nBeginning in 2014, Ukraine has been in a state of revolution and unrest. On 16 March, a disputed referendum was held in Crimea leading to the \"de facto\" secession of Crimea and its largely internationally unrecognized annexation to the Russian Federation.\nIn June 2016, in a referendum in the United Kingdom on the country's membership in the European Union, 52% of voters voted to leave the EU, leading to the complex Brexit separation process and negotiations, which led to political and economic changes for both the UK and the remaining European Union countries. The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. Later that year, Europe was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAccording to the \"Wall Street Journal\" in 2021 as Angela Merkel stepped down as Chancellor of Germany after 16 years: Ms. Merkel leaves in her wake a weakened Europe, a region whose aspirations to act as a third superpower have come to seem ever more unrealistic. When she became chancellor in 2005, the EU was at a high point: It had adopted the euro, which was meant to rival the dollar as a global currency, and had just expanded by absorbing former members of the Soviet bloc. Today\u2019s EU, by contrast, is geographically and economically diminished. Having lost the U.K. because of Brexit, it faces deep political and cultural divisions, lags behind in the global race for innovation and technology and is increasingly squeezed by the mounting U.S.-China strategic rivalry. Europe has endured thanks in part to Ms. Merkel\u2019s pragmatic stewardship, but it has been battered by crises during her entire time in office.Russia began an invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, in a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that began in 2014. It is the largest conventional military attack in Europe since World War II.\nChronology.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAD\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Beliefs that are \"held come what may\" are beliefs one is unwilling to give up, regardless of any evidence with which one might be presented.\nQuine held that any belief can be held come what may, so long as one makes suitable adjustments to other beliefs. In other words, all beliefs are rationally revisable (\"no statement is immune to revision\"). He used this to reject the distinction between analytic truths (which are true come what may) and synthetic truths (which are true at least in part because of the state of the world).\nMany philosophers argue to the contrary, believing that, for example, the laws of thought cannot be revised and may be \"held come what may\". Quine believed that all beliefs are linked by a web of beliefs, in which a belief is linked to another belief by supporting relations, but if one belief is found untrue, there is ground to find the linked beliefs also untrue. The latter statement is usually referred to as either confirmation holism or Duhem\u2013Quine thesis.\nA closely related phrase is \"hold more stubbornly at least\", also popularized by Quine. Some beliefs may be more useful than others, or may be implied by a large number of beliefs. Examples might be laws of logic, or the belief in an external world of physical objects. Altering such central portions of the web of beliefs would have immense, ramifying consequences, and affect many other beliefs. It is better to alter auxiliary beliefs around the edges of the web of beliefs (considered to be sense beliefs, rather than main beliefs) in the face of new evidence unfriendly to one's central principles. Thus, while one might agree that there is no belief one can hold come what may, there are some for which there is ample practical ground to \"hold more stubbornly at least\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13217", "revid": "4373841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13217", "title": "Haiku", "text": "Japanese poetry form\n is a type of short form poetry that originated in Japan. Traditional Japanese haiku consist of three phrases composed of 17 morae (called \"on\" in Japanese) in a 5, 7, 5 pattern; that include a \"kireji\", or \"cutting word\"; and a \"kigo\", or seasonal reference. However, haiku by classical Japanese poets, such as Matsuo Bash\u014d, also deviate from the 17-\"on\" pattern and sometimes do not contain a \"kireji\". Similar poems that do not adhere to these rules are generally classified as \"senry\u016b\".\nHaiku originated as an opening part of a larger Japanese genre of poetry called renga. These haiku written as an opening stanza were known as \"hokku\" and over time they began to be written as stand-alone poems. Haiku was given its current name by the Japanese writer Masaoka Shiki at the end of the 19th century.\nOriginally from Japan, haiku today are written by authors worldwide. Haiku in English and haiku in other languages have different styles and traditions while still incorporating aspects of the traditional haiku form. Non-Japanese language haiku vary widely on how closely they follow traditional elements. Additionally, a minority movement within , supported by Ogiwara Seisensui and his disciples, has varied from the tradition of 17 \"on\" as well as taking nature as their subject.\nIn Japanese, haiku are traditionally printed as a single line, while haiku in English often appear as three lines, although variations exist. There are several other forms of Japanese poetry related to haiku, such as tanka, as well as other art forms that incorporate haiku, such as haibun and haiga.\nTraditional elements.\n\"Kiru\" and \"kireji\".\nIn Japanese haiku, a \"kireji\", or cutting word, typically appears at the end of one of the verse's three phrases. A \"kireji\" fills a role analogous to that of a \"caesura\" in classical Western poetry or to a volta in sonnets. A \"kireji\" helps mark rhythmic divisions. Depending on which \"kireji\" is chosen and its position within the verse, it may briefly cut the stream of thought, suggesting a parallel between the preceding and following phrases, or it may provide a dignified ending, concluding the verse with a heightened sense of closure.\nThe \"kireji\" lends the verse structural support, allowing it to stand as an independent poem. The use of \"kireji\" distinguishes haiku and hokku from second and subsequent verses of renku; which may employ semantic and syntactic disjuncture, even to the point of occasionally end-stopping a phrase with a . However, renku typically employ \"kireji\".\nIn English, since \"kireji\" have no direct equivalent, poets sometimes use punctuation such as a dash or ellipsis, or an implied break to create a juxtaposition intended to prompt the reader to reflect on the relationship between the two parts.\nThe \"kireji\" in the Bash\u014d examples \"old pond\" and \"the wind of Mt Fuji\" are both \"ya\" (). Neither the remaining Bash\u014d example nor the Issa example contain a \"kireji\". However, they do both balance a fragment in the first five \"on\" against a phrase in the remaining 12 \"on\" (it may not be apparent from the English translation of the Issa that the first five \"on\" mean \"Edo's rain\").\n\"On\".\nIn comparison with English verse typically characterized by syllabic meter, Japanese verse counts sound units known as \"on\" or morae. Traditional haiku is usually fixed verse that consists of 17 \"on\", in three phrases of five, seven, and five \"on\", respectively. Among modern poems, traditionalist haiku continue to use the 5-7-5 pattern while free form haiku do not. However, one of the examples below illustrates that traditional haiku masters were not always constrained by the 5-7-5 pattern either. The free form haiku was advocated for by Ogiwara Seisensui and his disciples.\nAlthough the word \"on\" is sometimes translated as \"syllable\", the true meaning is more nuanced. One \"on\" in Japanese is counted for a short syllable, two for an elongated vowel or doubled consonant, and one for an \"n\" at the end of a syllable. Thus, the word \"haibun\", though counted as two syllables in English, is counted as four \"on\" in Japanese (ha-i-bu-n); and the word \"on\" itself, which English-speakers would view as a single syllable, comprises two \"on\": the short vowel o and the n. This is illustrated by the Issa haiku below, which contains 17 \"on\" but only 15 syllables. Conversely, some sounds, such as \"kyo\" () may look like two syllables to English speakers but are in fact a single \"on\" (as well as a single syllable) in Japanese.\nIn 1973, the Haiku Society of America noted that the norm for writers of haiku in English was to use 17 syllables, but they also noted a trend toward shorter haiku. According to the society, about 12 syllables in English approximates the duration of 17 Japanese \"on\".\n\"Kigo\".\nA haiku traditionally contains a \"kigo\", a word or phrase that symbolizes or implies the season of the poem and is drawn from a \"saijiki\", an extensive but prescriptive list of such words. Season words evoke images that are associated with the same time of year, making it a kind of logopoeia. \"Kigo\" are not always included in non-Japanese haiku or by modern writers of Japanese free-form haiku.\nExamples.\nOne of the best-known Japanese haiku is Matsuo Bash\u014d's \"old pond\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTranslated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis separates into \"on\" as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAnother haiku by Bash\u014d:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTranslated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs another example, this haiku by Bash\u014d illustrates that he was not always constrained to a 5-7-5 \"on\" pattern. It contains 18 \"on\" in the pattern 6-7-5.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTranslated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis separates into \"on\" as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis haiku example was written by Kobayashi Issa:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTranslated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis separates into \"on\" as,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOrigin and development.\nFrom hokku to haiku.\nHokku is the opening stanza of an orthodox collaborative linked poem, or renga, and of its later derivative, renku (or \"haikai no renga\"). By the time of Matsuo Bash\u014d (1644\u20131694), the hokku had begun to appear as an independent poem, and was also incorporated in haibun (a combination of prose and hokku), and haiga (a combination of painting with hokku). In the late 19th century, Masaoka Shiki (1867\u20131902) renamed the standalone hokku to haiku. The latter term is now generally applied retrospectively to all hokku appearing independently of renku or renga, irrespective of when they were written, and the use of the term hokku to describe a stand-alone poem is considered obsolete.\nBash\u014d.\nIn the 17th century, two masters arose who elevated \"haikai\" and gave it a new popularity. They were Matsuo Bash\u014d (1644\u20131694) and Uejima Onitsura (1661\u20131738). \"Hokku\" is the first verse of the collaborative \"haikai\" or \"renku\", but its position as the opening verse made it the most important, setting the tone for the whole composition. Even though \"hokku\" had sometimes appeared individually, they were always understood in the context of \"renku\". The Bash\u014d school promoted standalone \"hokku\" by including many in their anthologies, thus giving birth to what is now called \"haiku\". Bash\u014d also used his \"hokku\" as torque points within his short prose sketches and longer travel diaries. This subgenre of \"haikai\" is known as \"haibun\". His best-known work, \"Oku no Hosomichi\", or \"Narrow Roads to the Interior\", is counted as one of the classics of Japanese literature and has been translated into English extensively.\nBash\u014d was deified by both the imperial government and Shinto religious headquarters one hundred years after his death because he raised the haikai genre from a playful game of wit to sublime poetry. He continues to be revered as a saint of poetry in Japan, and is the one name from classical Japanese literature that is familiar throughout the world.\nBuson.\nThe next famous style of haikai to arise was that of Yosa Buson (1716\u20131784) and others such as Kit\u014d, called the Tenmei style after the Tenmei Era (1781\u20131789) in which it was created.\nBuson is recognized as one of the greatest masters of haiga (an art form where the painting is combined with haiku or haikai prose). His affection for painting can be seen in the painterly style of his haiku.\nIssa.\nNo new popular style followed Buson. However, a very individualistic, and at the same time humanistic, approach to writing haiku was demonstrated by the poet Kobayashi Issa (1763\u20131827), whose miserable childhood, poverty, sad life, and devotion to the Pure Land sect of Buddhism are evident in his poetry. Issa made the genre immediately accessible to wider audiences.\nShiki.\nMasaoka Shiki (1867\u20131902) was a reformer and modernizer. A prolific writer, even though chronically ill during a significant part of his life, Shiki disliked the 'stereotype' of haikai writers of the 19th century who were known by the deprecatory term \"tsukinami\", meaning 'monthly', after the monthly or twice-monthly \"haikai\" gatherings of the end of the 18th century (in regard to this period of \"haikai\", it came to mean 'trite' and 'hackneyed'). Shiki also sometimes criticized Bash\u014d. Like the Japanese intellectual world in general at that time, Shiki was strongly influenced by Western culture. He favored the painterly style of Buson and particularly the European concept of \"plein-air\" painting, which he adapted to create a style of haiku as a kind of nature sketch in words, an approach called . He popularized his views by verse columns and essays in newspapers.\nHokku up to the time of Shiki, even when appearing independently, were written in the context of renku. Shiki formally separated his new style of verse from the context of collaborative poetry. Being agnostic, he also separated it from the influence of Buddhism. Further, he discarded the term \"hokku\" and proposed the term \"haiku\" as an abbreviation of the phrase \"haikai no ku\" meaning a verse of \"haikai\", although the term predates Shiki by some two centuries, when it was used to mean \"any\" verse of haikai. Since then, \"haiku\" has been the term usually applied in both Japanese and English to all independent haiku, irrespective of their date of composition. Shiki's revisionism dealt a severe blow to renku and surviving haikai schools. The term \"hokku\" is now used chiefly in its original sense of the opening verse of a renku, and rarely to distinguish haiku written before Shiki's time.\nExposure to the West.\nThe earliest Westerner known to have written haiku was the Dutchman Hendrik Doeff (1764\u20131837), who was the Dutch commissioner in the Dejima trading post in Nagasaki during the first years of the 19th century. One of his haiku is the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse transliteration-translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAlthough there were further attempts outside Japan to imitate the \"hokku\" in the early 20th century, there was little understanding of its principles. Early Western scholars such as Basil Hall Chamberlain (1850\u20131935) and William George Aston were mostly dismissive of hokku's poetic value.\nBlyth.\nR. H. Blyth was an Englishman who lived in Japan. He produced a series of works on Zen, haiku, senry\u016b, and on other forms of Japanese and Asian literature. In 1949, with the publication in Japan of the first volume of \"Haiku\", the four-volume work by Blyth, haiku were introduced to the post-war English-speaking world. This four-volume series (1949\u201352) described haiku from the pre-modern period up to and including Shiki. Blyth's \"History of Haiku\" (1964) in two volumes is regarded as a classical study of haiku. Today Blyth is best known as a major interpreter of haiku to English speakers. His works have stimulated the writing of haiku in English.\nShimoi.\nThe Japanese-Italian translator and poet Harukichi Shimoi introduced haiku to Italy in the 1920s, through his work with the magazine Sakura as well as his close personal relationships within the Italian literati. Two notable influences are the haiku of his close friend Gabriele d'Annunzio, and to a lesser extent, those of Ezra Pound, to whom he was introduced in the early 1930s. An early example of his work appears in the 1919 novella \"La guerra italiana vista da un giapponese\", which features a haiku by the Japanese feminist poet Yosano Akiko:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nYasuda.\nThe Japanese-American scholar and translator Kenneth Yasuda published \"The Japanese Haiku: Its Essential Nature, History, and Possibilities in English, with Selected Examples\" in 1957. The book includes both translations from Japanese and original poems of his own in English, which had previously appeared in his book titled \"A Pepper-Pod: Classic Japanese Poems together with Original Haiku\". In these books Yasuda presented a critical theory about haiku, to which he added comments on haiku poetry by early 20th-century poets and critics. His translations apply a 5\u20137\u20135 syllable count in English, with the first and third lines end-rhymed. Yasuda considered that haiku translated into English should utilize all of the poetic resources of the language. Yasuda's theory also includes the concept of a \"haiku moment\" based in personal experience, and provides the motive for writing a haiku: \"'an aesthetic moment' of a timeless feeling of enlightened harmony as the poet's nature and the environment are unified\". This notion of the haiku moment has resonated with haiku writers in English, even though the notion is not widely promoted in Japanese haiku.\nHenderson.\nIn 1958, \"An Introduction to Haiku: An Anthology of Poems and Poets from Bash\u00f4 to Shiki\" by Harold G. Henderson was published by Doubleday Anchor Books. This book was a revision of Henderson's earlier book titled \"The Bamboo Broom\" (Houghton Mifflin, 1934). After World War II, Henderson and Blyth worked for the American Occupation in Japan and for the Imperial Household, respectively, and their shared appreciation of haiku helped form a bond between the two.\nHenderson translated every hokku and haiku into a rhymed tercet (ABA), whereas the Japanese originals never used rhyme. Unlike Yasuda, however, he recognized that 17 syllables in English are generally longer than the 17 \"on\" of a traditional Japanese haiku. Because the normal modes of English poetry depend on accentual meter rather than on syllabics, Henderson chose to emphasize the order of events and images in the originals. Nevertheless, many of Henderson's translations were in the five-seven-five pattern.\nHaiku in other languages.\nIn France, haiku was introduced by Paul-Louis Couchoud around 1906.\nIn the early 20th century, Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore composed haiku in Bengali. He also translated some from Japanese. In Gujarati, Jhinabhai Desai 'Sneharashmi' popularized haiku and remained a popular haiku writer. In February 2008, the World Haiku Festival was held in Bangalore, gathering \"haijin\" from all over India and Bangladesh, as well as from Europe and the United States. In South Asia, some other poets also write Haiku from time to time, most notably including the Pakistani poet Omer Tarin, who is also active in the movement for global nuclear disarmament and some of his 'Hiroshima Haiku' have been read at various peace conferences in Japan and the UK. Indian writer in Malayalam language, Ashitha, wrote several Haiku poems which have been published as a book. Her poems helped popularise haiku among the readers of Malayalam literature.\nIn 1992 Nobel laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz published the volume \"Haiku\" in which he translated from English to Polish haiku of Japanese masters and American and Canadian contemporary haiku authors.\nThe former president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, is a haiku writer and known as \"Haiku Herman\". He published a book of haiku in April 2010.\nEnglish-language haiku.\nPaul-Louis Couchoud's articles on haiku in French were read by early Imagist theoretician F. S. Flint, who passed on Couchoud's ideas to other members of the proto-Imagist Poets' Club such as Ezra Pound. Amy Lowell made a trip to London to meet Pound and learn about haiku. She returned to the United States, where she worked to interest others in this \"new\" form. Haiku subsequently had a considerable influence on Imagists in the 1910s, notably Pound's \"In a Station of the Metro\" of 1913, but, notwithstanding several efforts by Yone Noguchi to explain \"the hokku spirit\", there was as yet little understanding of the form and its history.\nOne of the first advocates of English-language hokku was the Japanese poet Yone Noguchi. In \"A Proposal to American Poets,\" published in the \"Reader\" magazine in February 1904, Noguchi gave a brief outline of the hokku and some of his English efforts, ending with the exhortation, \"Pray, you try Japanese Hokku, my American poets!\" At about the same time the poet Sadakichi Hartmann was publishing original English-language hokku, as well as other Japanese forms in both English and French.\nScholar Richard Iadonisi writes in his article, \"I Am Nobody\" that novelist Richard Wright is considered, \"the first noteworthy American minority writer\" to produce haiku. There is much scholarly debate over why Wright became interested with the haiku form. It is known that he had begun to study haiku while battling dysentery. While Wright was purportedly an avid reader of Ezra Pound\u2014 whose Imagist poetry was based on the haiku form\u2014 Iadonisi suggests that Wright was not interested in American style haiku. Instead, Wright opted to study the techniques of British writer Reginald Horace Blyth. He also studied classical haiku poets such as Kobayashi Issa and Matsuo Bash\u014d. Wright began writing a series of haiku in the summer of 1959, completing it in 1960. He had written thousands of haiku during that time span. Wright titled his work \"Haiku: This Other World\" and submitted it to William Targ of World Publishing, who rejected it. In 1998, thirty-eight years after Wright's death, \"This Other World\" was finally published.\nItalian-language haiku.\nProbably one of the first Italian encounters with Japanese poetry took place through the literary magazine \"L'Eco della Cultura\" (founded in 1914), which published texts of Japanese poetry edited by Vincenzo Siniscalchi. From 1920 to 1921, the University of Naples published a magazine, \"Sakura\", on the study of Japanese culture, with the collaboration of the Japanese scholar Harukichi Shimoi. An Italian translation of a haiku by Akiko Yosano is included in Shimoi's 1919 novella \"La guerra italiana vista da un giapponese\". Gabriele D'Annunzio also experimented with the haiku in the early twentieth century.\nIn 1921 the magazine \"La Ronda\" published a negative critique of the Japanese \"Hai-kai\" fashion that was spreading in France and Spain, while in the following years many futurists appreciated the fast haiku style. In Italy, the national haiku association was founded in Rome in 1987 by Sono Uchida, the well-known Japanese haijin and the ambassador of Japan in Vatican. Soon after, the national association called Italian Friends of the haiku (Associazione Italiana Amici dell'Haiku) was established, and then the Italian Haiku Association. The poet Mario Chini (1876\u20131959) published the book of haiku titled \"Moments\" (Rome, 1960). Later, Edoardo Sanguineti published some of his haiku. The famed poet Andrea Zanzotto also published a collection of haiku in English, which he translated back into his native Italian (Haiku for a Season / Haiku per una stagione, Chicago: U. of Chicago Press, 2021).\nSpanish-language haiku.\nIn Spain, several prominent poets experimented with haiku, including Joan Alcover, Antonio Machado, Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez and Luis Cernuda. Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca also experimented with and learned conciseness from the form while still a student in 1921. The most persistent, however, was Isaac del Vando, whose \"La Sombrilla Japonesa\" (1924) went through several editions. The form was also used in Catalan by the avant-garde writers Josep Maria Junoy (1885\u20131955) and Joan Salvat-Papasseit, by the latter notably in his sequence \"Vibracions\" (1921).\nThe Mexican poet Jos\u00e9 Juan Tablada is credited with popularising haiku in his country, reinforced by the publication of two collections composed entirely in that form: \"Un dia\" (1919), and \"El jarro de flores\" (1922). In the introduction to the latter, Tablada noted that two young Mexicans, Rafael Lozano and Carlos Guti\u00e9rrez Cruz, had also begun writing them. They were followed soon after by Carlos Pellicer, Xavier Villaurrutia, and by Jaime Torres Bodet in his collection \"Biombo\" (1925). Much later, Octavio Paz included many haiku in \"Piedras Sueltas\" (1955).\nElsewhere the Ecuadorian poet and diplomat Jorge Carrera Andrade included haiku among the 31 poems contained in \"Microgramas\" (Tokio 1940) and the Argentine Jorge Luis Borges in the collection \"La cifra\" (1981).\nSoutheastern Europe.\nThe first publication in Yugoslavia treating haiku was Milo\u0161 Crnjanski's \"Poezija starog Japana\" (Poetry of Ancient Japan), published in 1925. He was attracted to the aesthetics of \"aioi-no-matsu\" - the eternal - and Buddhist empathy, in common with his poetic theme of connecting distant things and concepts through affection.\nIn socialist Yugoslavia, development of haiku poetry began during the 1960s, when the first haiku books were written, starting with \"Leptirova krila\" (The Butterfly's Wings) by Dubravko Ivan\u010dan in 1964. Other writers include Vladimir Zor\u010di\u0107 (1941\u20131995), Milan Tokin's (1909\u20131962) unpublished collection \"Godi\u0161nja doba\" (Seasons), Desanka Maksimovi\u0107, Alexander Neugebauer (1930\u20131989), and Zvonko Petrovi\u0107 (1925\u20132009). Vladimir Devide (1925\u20132010) published the first book on haiku theory in 1970, titled Japanese Poetry and its Cultural and Historical Context, with many translations of Japanese classics. Dejan Razi\u0107 (1935\u20131985) published two books on haiku in 1979, The Development of Haikai Poetry from its Beginning to Basho, and The Peak of Haikai Poetry. The journal Haiku ran from 1977 to 1981.\nThe Haiku Marathon (1982) and the Yugoslav Haiku Competition (1985) were organised in the 1980s by Slavko Sedlar. The first Serbian haiku journal Paun started being published in 1988 with Milijan Despotovi\u0107 as an editor. The journal Kulture istoka (1983\u20131992) gave further impetus to the study of Japanese and other oriental cultures. In 1991, the Belgrade-based haiku club \u0160iki was formed, named after Masaoka Shiki. In 1999, Anakiev together with Serge Tome created the web site Haiku Association of Southeastern Europe. The Haiku Association of Yugoslavia was formed in 2000. The multilingual \"Knots- The Anthology of Southeastern European Haiku Poetry\" was published in 1999 with poems from writers all over southeastern Europe. The 2000 conference of the World Haiku Federation was held in Slovenia.\nIn addition to its traditional aesthetic functions, haiku has also been adapted globally as a form for social commentary and critique. A 2025 academic study from Salahaddin University highlighted this trend, arguing that poets from diverse cultural backgrounds, including the United States, Japan, and Iraq, have used the concise form to address social reform and critique issues such as racial capitalism, post-war alienation, and the trauma of conflict.\nRelated forms.\nHaibun.\nHaibun is a combination of prose and haiku, often autobiographical or written in the form of a travel journal. Well-known examples of haibun include \"Oku no Hosomichi\" by Bash\u014d and \"Ora ga Haru\" by Issa.\nHaiga.\nHaiga is a style of Japanese painting based on the aesthetics of haikai, and usually including a haiku. Today, haiga artists combine haiku with paintings, photographs and other art.\nKuhi.\nThe carving of famous haiku on natural stone to make poem monuments known as \"kuhi\" () has been a popular practice for many centuries.

The critic Leonard Maltin called him \"the greatest American director who is not a household name.\" Roger Ebert called Hawks \"one of the greatest American directors of pure movies, and a hero of auteur critics because he found his own laconic values in so many different kinds of genre material.\" He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for \"Sergeant York\" (1941) and earned the Honorary Academy Award in 1974. A versatile director, Hawks explored many genres such as comedies, dramas, gangster films, science fiction, film noir, war films and Westerns. His most popular films include \"Scarface\" (1932), \"Bringing Up Baby\" (1938), \"Only Angels Have Wings\" (1939), \"His Girl Friday\" (1940), \"To Have and Have Not\" (1944), \"The Big Sleep\" (1946), \"Red River\" (1948), \"The Thing from Another World\" (1951), \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" (1953), and \"Rio Bravo\" (1959). His frequent portrayals of strong, tough-talking female characters came to define the \"Hawksian woman\".\nHis work has influenced such directors as Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, John Carpenter, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Quentin Tarantino and Michael Mann. \"Entertainment Weekly\" placed Hawks fourth on their list of greatest directors, writing: \"His hallmarks are more thematic than visual: men who adhere to an understated code of manliness; women who like to yank the rug out from under those men's feet; a mistrust of pomposity; a love of sly, leg-pulling wit. Yet there's the ease of the complete filmmaker in his Westerns, dramas, musicals, detective films, and supremely confident comedies. No wonder the French adored the guy: His casual profundity was the studio's best advertisement for itself.\" Jean-Luc Godard called him \"the greatest of all American artists\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life and background.\nHoward Winchester Hawks was born in Goshen, Indiana. He was the first-born child of Frank Winchester Hawks (1865\u20131950), a wealthy paper manufacturer, and his wife, Helen Brown (n\u00e9e Howard; 1872\u20131952), the daughter of a wealthy industrialist. Hawks's family on his father's side were American pioneers, and his ancestor John Hawks had emigrated from England to Massachusetts in 1630. The family eventually settled in Goshen and by the 1890s was one of the wealthiest families in the Midwest, due mostly to the highly profitable Goshen Milling Company.\nHawks's maternal grandfather, C. W. Howard (1845\u20131916), had homesteaded in Neenah, Wisconsin, in 1862 at age 17. Within 15 years he had made his fortune in the town's paper mill and other industrial endeavors. Frank Hawks and Helen Howard met in the early 1890s and married in 1895. Howard Hawks was the eldest of five children, and his birth was followed by Kenneth Neil Hawks (August 12, 1898 \u2013 January 2, 1930), William Bellinger Hawks (January 29, 1901 \u2013 January 10, 1969), Grace Louise Hawks (October 17, 1903 \u2013 December 23, 1927), and Helen Bernice Hawks (1906 \u2013 May 4, 1911). In 1898, the family moved back to Neenah where Frank Hawks began working for his father-in-law's Howard Paper Company.\nBetween 1906 and 1909, the Hawks family began to spend more time in Pasadena, California, during the cold Wisconsin winters in order to improve Helen Hawks's ill health. Gradually, they began to spend only their summers in Wisconsin before permanently moving to Pasadena in 1910. The family settled in a house down the street from Throop Polytechnic Institute, and the Hawks children began attending the school's Polytechnic Elementary School in 1907. Hawks was an average student and did not excel in sports, but by 1910 had discovered coaster racing, an early form of soapbox racing. In 1911, Hawks's youngest sibling, Helen, died suddenly of food poisoning. From 1910 to 1912, Hawks attended Pasadena High School. In 1912, the Hawks family moved to nearby Glendora, California, where Frank Hawks owned orange groves. Hawks finished his junior year of high school at Citrus Union High School in Glendora. During this time he worked as a barnstorming pilot.\nHe was sent to Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire from 1913 to 1914; his family's wealth may have influenced his acceptance to the elite private school. Even though he was 17, he was admitted as a lower middleclassman, the equivalent of a sophomore. While in New England, Hawks often attended the theaters in nearby Boston. In 1914, Hawks returned to Glendora and graduated from Pasadena High School that year. Skilled in tennis, at 18 Hawks won the United States Junior Tennis Championship. That same year, Hawks was accepted to Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he majored in mechanical engineering and was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon. His college friend Ray S. Ashbury remembered Hawks spending more of his time playing craps and drinking alcohol than studying, although Hawks was also known to be a voracious reader of popular American and English novels in college.\nWhile working in the film industry during his 1916 summer vacation, Hawks made an unsuccessful attempt to transfer to Stanford University. He returned to Cornell that September, leaving in April 1917 to join the Army when the United States entered World War I. He served as a lieutenant in the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps. During World War I, he taught aviators to fly, and these experiences influenced future aviation films like \"The Dawn Patrol\" (1930). Like many college students who joined the armed services during the war, he received a degree in absentia in 1918. Before Hawks was called for active duty, he returned to Hollywood and, by the end of April 1917, was working on a Cecil B. DeMille film.\nCareer.\nEntering films (1916\u20131925).\nHoward Hawks's interest and passion for aviation led him to many important experiences and acquaintances. In 1916, Hawks met Victor Fleming, a Hollywood cinematographer who had been an auto mechanic and early aviator. Hawks had begun racing and working on a Mercer race car\u2014bought for him by his grandfather C.W. Howard\u2014during his 1916 summer vacation in California. He allegedly met Fleming when the two men raced on a dirt track and caused an accident. This meeting led to Hawks's first job in the film industry, as a prop boy on the Douglas Fairbanks film \"In Again, Out Again\" (on which Fleming was employed as the cinematographer) for Famous Players\u2013Lasky. According to Hawks, a new set needed to be built quickly when the studio's set designer was unavailable, so Hawks volunteered to do the job himself, much to Fairbanks's satisfaction. He was next employed as a prop boy and general assistant on an unspecified film directed by Cecil B. DeMille. (Hawks never named the film in later interviews, and DeMille made roughly five films in that time period). By the end of April 1917, Hawks was working on Cecil B. DeMille's \"The Little American\". Hawks worked on Marshall Neilan's \"The Little Princess\", starring Mary Pickford. According to Hawks, Neilan did not show up to work one day, so the resourceful Hawks offered to direct a scene himself, to which Pickford consented. Hawks began directing at age 21 after he and cinematographer Charles Rosher filmed a double exposure dream sequence Pickford.\nHawks worked with Pickford and Neilan again on \"Amarilly of Clothes-Line Alley\" before joining the United States Army Air Service. Hawks's military records were destroyed in the 1973 Military Archive Fire, so the only account of his military service is his own. According to Hawks, he spent 15 weeks in basic training at the University of California in Berkeley where he was trained to be a squadron commander in the Air Service. When Pickford visited Hawks at basic training, his superior officers were so impressed by the appearance of the celebrity that they promoted him to flight instructor and sent him to Texas to teach new recruits. Bored by this work, Hawks attempted to secure a transfer during the first half of 1918 and was eventually sent to Fort Monroe, Virginia. The Armistice was signed in November of that year, and Hawks was discharged as a Second Lieutenant without having seen active duty.\nAfter the war, Hawks was eager to return to Hollywood. His brother Kenneth Hawks, who had also served in the Air Service, graduated from Yale in 1919, and the two of them moved to Hollywood together to pursue their careers. They quickly made friends with Hollywood insider Allan Dwan. Hawks landed his first important job when he used his family's wealth to loan money to studio head Jack L. Warner. Warner quickly paid back the loan and hired Hawks as a producer to \"oversee\" the making of a new series of one-reel comedies starring the Italian comedian Monty Banks. Hawks later stated that he personally directed \"three or four\" of the shorts, though no documentation exists to confirm the claim. The films were profitable, but Hawks soon left to form his own production company using his family's wealth and connections to secure financing. The production company, \"Associated Producers\", was a joint venture between Hawks, Allan Dwan, Marshall Neilan and director Allen Holubar, with a distribution deal with First National. The company made 14 films between 1920 and 1923, with eight directed by Neilan, three by Dwan and three by Holubar. More of a \"boy's club\" than a production company, the four men gradually drifted apart and went their separate ways in 1923, by which time Hawks had decided that he wanted to direct rather than produce.\nBeginning in early 1920, Hawks lived in rented houses in Hollywood with the group of friends he was accumulating. This rowdy group of mostly macho, risk-taking men included his brother Kenneth Hawks, Victor Fleming, Jack Conway, Harold Rosson, Richard Rosson, Arthur Rosson, and Eddie Sutherland. During this time, Hawks first met Irving Thalberg, the vice-president in charge of production at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Hawks admired his intelligence and sense of story. Hawks also became friends with barn stormers and pioneer aviators at Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, getting to know men like Moye Stephens.\nIn 1923, Famous Players\u2013Lasky president Jesse Lasky was looking for a new Production Editor in the story department of his studio, and Thalberg suggested Hawks. Hawks accepted and was immediately put in charge of over 40 productions, including several literary acquisitions of stories by Joseph Conrad, Jack London and Zane Grey. Hawks worked on the scripts for all of the films produced, but he had his first official screenplay credit in 1924 on \"Tiger Love\". Hawks was the Story Editor at Famous Players (later Paramount Pictures) for almost two years, occasionally editing such films as \"Heritage of the Desert\". Hawks signed a new one-year contract with Famous-Players in the fall of 1924. He broke his contract to become a story editor for Thalberg at MGM, having secured a promise from Thalberg to make him a director within a year. In 1925, when Thalberg hesitated to keep his promise, Hawks broke his contract at MGM and left.\nSilent films (1925\u20131929).\nIn October 1925, Sol Wurtzel, William Fox's studio superintendent at the Fox Film Corporation, invited Hawks to join his company with the promise of letting him direct. Over the next three years, Hawks directed his first eight films (six silent, two \"talkies\"). Hawks reworked the scripts of most of the films he directed without always taking official credit for his work. He also worked on the scripts for \"Honesty \u2013 The Best Policy\" in 1926 and Joseph von Sternberg's \"Underworld\" in 1927, famous for being one of the first gangster films. Hawks's first film was \"The Road to Glory\", which premiered in April 1926. The screenplay was based on a 35-page composition written by Hawks, making it one of the only films on which Hawks had extensive writing credit. Today, it is one of Hawks's two lost films. Immediately after completing \"The Road to Glory\", Hawks began writing his next film, \"Fig Leaves\", his first (and, until 1935, only) comedy. It received positive reviews, particularly for the art direction and costume designs. It was released in July 1926 and was Hawks's first hit as a director. Although he mainly dismissed his early work, Hawks praised this film in later interviews.\n\"Paid to Love\" is notable in Hawks's filmography, because it was a highly stylized, experimental film, \u00e0 la German director F. W. Murnau. Hawks's film includes atypical tracking shots, expressionistic lighting and stylistic film editing that was inspired by German expressionist cinema. In a later interview, Hawks commented, \"It isn't my type of stuff, at least I got it over in a hurry. You know the idea of wanting the camera to do those things: Now the camera's somebody's eyes.\" Hawks worked on the script with Seton I. Miller, with whom he would go on to collaborate on seven more films. The film stars George O'Brien as the introverted Crown Prince Michael, William Powell as his happy-go-lucky brother and Virginia Valli as Michael's flapper love interest, Dolores. The characters played by Valli and O'Brien anticipate those found in later films by Hawks: a sexually aggressive showgirl, who is an early prototype of the \"Hawksian woman\", and a shy man disinterested in sex, found in later roles played by Cary Grant and Gary Cooper. \"Paid to Love\" was completed by September 1926, but remained unreleased until July 1927. It was financially unsuccessful. \"Cradle Snatchers\" was based on a 1925 hit stage play by Russell G. Medcraft and Norma Mitchell. The film was shot in early 1927. The film was released in May 1927 and was a minor hit. It was believed to be lost until Peter Bogdanovich discovered a print in 20th Century Fox's film vaults, although it was missing part of reel three and all of reel four. In March 1927, Hawks signed a new one-year, three-picture contract with Fox and was assigned to direct \"Fazil\", based on the play \"L'Insoumise\" by Pierre Frondaie. Hawks again worked with Seton Miller on the script. Hawks was over schedule and over budget on the film, which began a rift between him and Sol Wurtzel that would eventually lead to Hawks leaving Fox. The film was finished in August 1927, though it was not released until June 1928.\n\"A Girl in Every Port\" is considered by scholars to be the most important of Hawks's silent films. It is the first to feature many of the themes and archetypes that would define much of his subsequent work. It was his first \"love story between two men\", with two men bonding over their duty, skills and careers, who consider their friendship to be more important than their relationships with women. In France, Henri Langlois called Hawks \"the Gropius of the cinema\" and Swiss novelist and poet Blaise Cendrars said that the film \"definitely marked the first appearance of contemporary cinema.\" Hawks went over budget once again with this film, and his relationship with Sol Wurtzel deteriorated. After an advance screening that received positive reviews, Wurtzel told Hawks, \"This is the worst picture Fox has made in years.\" After seeing Louise Brooks in \"A Girl in Every Port\", G. W. Pabst cast her in \"Pandora's Box\" (1929). \"The Air Circus\" was Hawks's first film centered around aviation, one of his early passions. In 1928, Charles Lindbergh was the world's most famous person and \"Wings\" was one of the most popular films of the year. Wanting to capitalize on the country's aviation craze, Fox immediately bought Hawks's original story for \"The Air Circus\", a variation of the theme of male friendship about two young pilots. The film was shot from April to June 1928, but Fox ordered an additional 15 minutes of dialogue footage so that the film could compete with the new talkies being released. Hawks hated the new dialogue written by Hugh Herbert, and he refused to participate in the re-shoots. It was released in September 1928 and was a moderate hit and is one of two Hawks films that are lost.\n\"Trent's Last Case\" is an adaptation of E. C. Bentley's 1913 novel of the same name. Hawks considered the novel to be \"one of the greatest detective stories of all time\" and was eager to make it his first sound film. He cast Raymond Griffith in the lead role of Phillip Trent. Griffith's throat had been damaged by poison gas during World War I, and his voice was a hoarse whisper, prompting Hawks to later state, \"I thought he ought to be great in talking pictures \"because\" of that voice.\" However, after shooting only a few scenes, Fox shut Hawks down and ordered him to make a silent film, both because of Griffith's voice and because they only owned the legal rights to make a silent film. The film did have a musical score and synchronized sound effects but no dialogue. Due to the failing business of silent films, it was never released in the US and only briefly screened in England where critics hated it. The film was believed lost until the mid-1970s and was screened for the first time in the US at a Hawks retrospective in 1974. Hawks was in attendance of the screening and attempted to have the only print of the film destroyed. Hawks's contract with Fox ended in May 1929, and he never again signed a long-term contract with a major studio. He managed to remain an independent producer-director for the rest of his long career.\nEarly sound films (1930\u20131934).\nBy 1930, Hollywood was in upheaval over the coming of \"talkies\", and the careers of many actors and directors were ruined. Hollywood studios were recruiting stage actors and directors that they believed were better suited for sound films. After working in the industry for 14 years and directing many financially successful films, Hawks found he had to prove himself an asset to the studios once again. Leaving Fox on sour terms did not help his reputation, but Hawks never backed down from fights with studio heads. After several months of unemployment, Hawks renewed his career with his first sound film in 1930.\nHawks's first all-sound film was \"The Dawn Patrol\", based on an original story by John Monk Saunders and (unofficially) Hawks. Reportedly, Hawks paid Saunders to put his name on the film, so that Hawks could direct the film without arousing concern due to his lack of writing experience. Accounts vary on who came up with the idea of the film, but Hawks and Saunders developed the story together and tried to sell it to several studios before First National agreed to produce it. Shooting began in late February 1930, about the same time that Howard Hughes was finishing his World War I aviation epic \"Hell's Angels\", which had been in production since September 1927. Shrewdly, Hawks began to hire many of the aviation experts and cameramen that had been employed by Hughes, including Elmer Dyer, Harry Reynolds and Ira Reed. When Hughes found out about the rival film, he did everything he could to sabotage \"The Dawn Patrol\". He harassed Hawks and other studio personnel, hired a spy that was quickly caught, and finally sued First National for copyright infringement. Hughes eventually dropped the lawsuit in late 1930\u2014he and Hawks had become good friends during the legal battle. Filming was finished in late May 1930, and it premiered in July, setting a first-week box office record at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York. The film became one of the biggest hits of 1930. The success of this film allowed Hawks to gain respect in the field of filmmaking and allowed him to spend the rest of his career as an independent director without the necessity to sign any long-term contracts with specific studios.\nHawks did not get along with Warner Brothers executive Hal B. Wallis, and his contract allowed him to be loaned out to other studios. Hawks took the opportunity to accept a directing offer from Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures. The film opened in January 1931 and was a hit. The film was banned in Chicago, and experienced censorship, which would continue in his next film project. In 1930, Hughes hired Hawks to direct \"Scarface\", a gangster film loosely based on the life of Chicago mobster Al Capone. The film was completed in September 1931, but the censorship of the Hays Code prevented it from being released as Hawks and Hughes had originally intended. The two men fought, negotiated, and made compromises with the Hays Office for over a year, until the film was eventually released in 1932, after such other pivotal early gangster films as \"The Public Enemy\" and \"Little Caesar\". \"Scarface\" was the first film on which Hawks worked with screenwriter Ben Hecht, who became a close friend and collaborator for 20 years. After filming was complete on \"Scarface\", Hawks left Hughes to fight the legal battles and returned to First National to fulfill his contract, this time with producer Darryl F. Zanuck. For his next film, Hawks wanted to make a film about his childhood passion: car racing. Hawks developed the script for \"The Crowd Roars\" with Seton Miller for their eighth and final collaboration. Hawks used real race car drivers in the film, including the 1930 Indianapolis 500 winner Billy Arnold. The film was released in March and became a hit.\nLater in 1932, he directed \"Tiger Shark\", starring Edward G. Robinson as a tuna fisherman. In these early films, Hawks established the prototypical \"Hawksian Man\", which film critic Andrew Sarris described as \"upheld by an instinctive professionalism.\" \"Tiger Shark\" demonstrated Hawks's ability to incorporate touches of humor into dramatic, tense and even tragic story lines. In 1933, Hawks signed a three-picture deal at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, the first of which was \"Today We Live\" in 1933. This World War I film was based on a short story by William Faulkner. Hawks's next two films at MGM were the boxing drama \"The Prizefighter and the Lady\" and the bio-pic \"Viva Villa!\". Studio interference on both films led Hawks to walk out on his MGM contract without completing either film himself.\nLater sound films (1935\u20131970).\nIn 1934, Hawks went to Columbia Pictures to make \"Twentieth Century\", starring John Barrymore and Hawks's distant cousin Carole Lombard. It was based on a stage play by Hecht and Charles MacArthur and, along with Frank Capra's \"It Happened One Night\" (released the same year), is considered to be the defining film of the screwball comedy genre. In 1935, Hawks made \"Barbary Coast\" with Edward G. Robinson and Miriam Hopkins. Hawks collaborated with Hecht and MacArthur on \"Barbary Coast\" and reportedly convinced them to work on the film by promising to teach them a marble game. They would switch off between working on the script and playing with marbles during work days. In 1936, he made the aviation adventure \"Ceiling Zero\" with James Cagney and Pat O'Brien. Also in 1936, Hawks began filming \"Come and Get It\", starring Edward Arnold, Joel McCrea, Frances Farmer and Walter Brennan, but he was fired by Samuel Goldwyn in the middle of shooting, and the film was completed by William Wyler.\nIn 1938, Hawks made the screwball comedy \"Bringing Up Baby\" for RKO Pictures. It starred Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn and was adapted by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde. Sarris called it \"the screwiest of the screwball comedies\". Grant plays a near-sighted paleontologist who suffers one humiliation after another due to the lovestruck socialite played by Hepburn. Hawks's artistic direction for \"Bringing Up Baby\" revolved around the raw natural chemistry between Grant and Hepburn. With Grant portraying the paleontologist and Hepburn as an heiress, the roles only add to the movie's purpose of disintegrating the line between the real and the imaginary. \"Bringing Up Baby\" was a box office flop when initially released and, subsequently, RKO fired Hawks due to extreme losses; however, the film has become regarded as one of Hawks's masterpieces. Regarding Hepburn, Hawks said: \"We had trouble with Kate at first. The great trouble is people trying to be funny. If they don't try to be funny, then they are funny.\" Hawks followed it with 11 consecutive hits up to 1951, starting with the aviation drama \"Only Angels Have Wings\", made in 1939 for Columbia Pictures and starring Grant, Jean Arthur, Thomas Mitchell, Rita Hayworth and Richard Barthelmess.\nHawks returned to screwball comedy with \"His Girl Friday\" (1940), starring Grant and Rosalind Russell and featuring Ralph Bellamy. It was an adaptation of the Broadway hit \"The Front Page\" by Hecht and MacArthur, which had been made into a film in 1931. David Thomson writes that Hawks \"turned \"The Front Page\" inside out \u2013 this is the first demolition re-make (a noble form). He said, suppose the editor and the reporter are a man and a woman, a married couple (just divorced), and the woman is on the point of leaving the paper to get married to a decent, wholesome, truthful idiot? Thus agreeable entertainment becomes ravishing art; thus a sentimental tribute to friendship becomes a frenzied rhapsody on the perils of being in love while guarding the love against all those plausibly 'real' things.\" Not forgetting the influence Jesse Lasky had on his early career, in 1941, Hawks made \"Sergeant York\", starring Gary Cooper as a pacifist farmer who becomes a decorated World War I soldier. Hawks directed the film and cast Cooper as a specific favor to Lasky. This was the highest-grossing film of 1941 and won two Academy Awards, for Best Actor and Best Editing, as well as earning Hawks his only nomination for Best Director. Later that year, Hawks worked with Cooper again for \"Ball of Fire\", which also starred Barbara Stanwyck. The film was written by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett and is a playful take on \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\". Cooper plays a sheltered, intellectual linguist who is writing an encyclopedia with six other scientists and hires street-wise Stanwyck to help them with modern slang terms. In 1941, Hawks began work on the Howard Hughes-produced (and later directed) film \"The Outlaw\", based on the life of Billy the Kid and starring Jane Russell. Hawks completed initial shooting of the film in early 1941, but due to perfectionism and battles with the Hollywood Production Code, Hughes continued to re-shoot and re-edit the film until 1943, when it was finally released with Hawks uncredited as director.\nAfter making the World War II film \"Air Force\" (1943), starring John Garfield and written by Nichols, Hawks did two films with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. \"To Have and Have Not\" (1944) stars Bogart, Bacall and Brennan and is based on a novel by Ernest Hemingway. Hawks was a close friend of Hemingway and made a bet with the author that he could make a good film out of Hemingway's \"worst book\". Hawks, William Faulkner and Jules Furthman collaborated on the script, about an American fishing boat captain working out of Martinique after the Fall of France in 1940. Bogart and Bacall fell in love on the set of the film and married soon afterwards. The greatest strength of the movie has been said to come from its atmosphere and use of wit that really plays on the strengths of Bacall and helps the movie solidify the theme of beauty in perpetual opposition. \"To Have and Have Not\" is the only film with contributions from two Nobel laureates, Hemingway and Faulkner. Hawks reunited with Bogart and Bacall in 1945 and 1946 with \"The Big Sleep\", based on the Philip Marlowe detective novel by Raymond Chandler. An early 1945 version was substantially recut to comprise the final 1946 U.S. release with additional scenes emphasizing the special repartee chemistry between Bogart and Bacall. The screenplay for the film also reteamed Faulkner and Furthman, in addition to Leigh Brackett. Chandler, who had been nominated for an Oscar as co-author of the 1944 \"Double Indemnity\" screenplay, was not invited to help adapt his best selling novel. The film featured Dorothy Malone in her breakout role, in a part that was largely improvised. Hawks said of her scene: \"We just did it because the girl was so damn good-looking. It taught me a great lesson, that if you make a good scene, if we could do something that was fun, the audience goes right along with you.\" The plot is notoriously convoluted; Hawks recalled that \"I never figured out what was going on, but I thought the basic thing had great scenes in it, and was good entertainment. After that I said, 'I'm never going to worry about being logical again.'\"\nIn 1948, Hawks made \"Red River\", an epic Western reminiscent of \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift in his first film. Later that year, Hawks remade his \"Ball of Fire\" as \"A Song Is Born\", this time starring Danny Kaye and Virginia Mayo. This version follows the same plot but pays more attention to popular jazz music and includes such jazz legends as Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton and Benny Carter playing themselves. In 1949, Hawks reteamed with Grant in the screwball comedy \"I Was a Male War Bride\", also starring Ann Sheridan.\nIn 1951, Hawks produced, and according to some, directed, a science-fiction film, \"The Thing from Another World\". Director John Carpenter stated: \"And let's get the record straight. The movie was directed by Howard Hawks. Verifiably directed by Howard Hawks. He let his editor, Christian Nyby, take credit. But the kind of feeling between the male characters\u2014the camaraderie, the group of men that has to fight off the evil\u2014it's all pure Hawksian.\" He followed this with the 1952 Western \"The Big Sky\", starring Kirk Douglas. Later in 1952, Hawks worked with Grant for the fifth and final time in the screwball comedy \"Monkey Business\", which also starred Marilyn Monroe and Ginger Rogers. Grant plays a scientist (reminiscent of his character in \"Bringing up Baby\") who creates a formula that increases his vitality. Film critic John Belton called the film Hawks's \"most organic comedy\". Hawks's third film of 1952 was a contribution to the omnibus film \"O. Henry's Full House\", which includes short stories by the writer O. Henry made by various directors. Hawks's short film \"The Ransom of Red Chief\" starred Fred Allen, Oscar Levant and Jeanne Crain.\nIn 1953, Hawks made \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\", which famously featured Marilyn Monroe singing \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\". The film starred Monroe and Jane Russell as two cabaret performing best friends; many critics argue that the film is the only female version of the \"buddy film\" genre. Choreographer Jack Cole is generally credited with staging the musical numbers while Hawks is credited with directing the non-musical scenes. In 1955, Hawks made \"Land of the Pharaohs\", a sword-and-sandal epic about ancient Egypt that stars Jack Hawkins and Joan Collins. The film was Hawks's final collaboration with longtime friend William Faulkner. In 1959, Hawks worked with John Wayne in \"Rio Bravo\", also starring Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson and Walter Brennan as four lawmen \"defending the fort\" of their local jail in which a local criminal is awaiting a trial while his family attempt to break him out. The screenplay was written by Furthman and Leigh Brackett, who had collaborated with Hawks previously on \"The Big Sleep\". Film critic Robin Wood has said that if he \"were asked to choose a film that would justify the existence of Hollywood\u00a0... it would be \"Rio Bravo\".\"\nIn 1962, Hawks made \"Hatari!\", again with Wayne, who plays a wild animal catcher in Africa. It was also written by Leigh Brackett. Hawks's knowledge of mechanics allowed him to build the camera-car hybrid that allowed him to film the hunting scenes in the film. In 1964, Hawks made his final comedy, \"Man's Favorite Sport?\", starring Rock Hudson (since Cary Grant felt he was too old for the role) and Paula Prentiss. Hawks then returned to his childhood passion for car races with \"Red Line 7000\" in 1965, featuring a young James Caan in his first leading role. Hawks's final two films were both Western remakes of \"Rio Bravo\" starring John Wayne and written by Leigh Brackett. In 1966, Hawks directed \"El Dorado\", starring Wayne, Robert Mitchum, and Caan, which was released the following year. He then made \"Rio Lobo\", with Wayne in 1970. After \"Rio Lobo\", Hawks planned a project relating to Ernest Hemingway and \"Now, Mr. Gus\", a comedy about two male friends seeking oil and money. He died in December 1977, before these projects were completed.\nPersonal life.\nHoward Hawks was married three times: to actress Athole Shearer, sister of Norma Shearer, from 1928 to 1940; to socialite and fashion icon Slim Keith from 1941 to 1949; and to actress Dee Hartford from 1953 to 1959. Hawks had two children with Shearer, Barbara and David. David Hawks worked as an assistant director for the television series \"M*A*S*H\". His second daughter, Kitty Hawks, was a result of his second marriage to \"Slim\" Keith. Hawks had one son with his last wife, Dee Hartford, who was named Gregg after cinematographer Gregg Toland.\nAlong with his love of flying machines, Hawks also had a passion for cars and motorcycles. He built the race car that won the 1936 Indianapolis 500, as well as enjoyed riding motorcycles with Barbara Stanwyck and Gary Cooper. Hawks and his son Gregg were members of Checkers Motorcycle Club. Hawks continued riding until the age of 78. His other hobbies included golf, tennis, sailing, horse racing, carpentry, and silversmithing.\nHawks was also known for maintaining close friendships with many American writers such as Ben Hecht, Ernest Hemingway, and William Faulkner. Hawks credited himself with the discovery of William Faulkner and introducing the then-unknown writer to the Algonquin Round Table. Hawks and Faulkner had mutual interests in flying and drinking, and Faulkner admired the films of Hawks, asking Hawks to teach him how to write screenplays. Faulkner wrote five screenplays for Hawks, the first being \"Today We Live\" and the last being \"Land of the Pharaohs\". With a mutual interest in fishing and skiing, Hawks was also close with Ernest Hemingway and was almost made the director of the film adaptation of \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\". Hawks found it difficult to forgive Hemingway for his suicide. After coming to terms with it in the 1970s, he began to plan a film project about Hemingway and his relationship with Robert Capa. He never filmed the project.\nHawks supported Thomas Dewey in the 1944 United States presidential election.\nLater life and death.\nBy the mid-1970s, Hawks's health began to decline, though he remained active. In addition to being in the early stages of Parkinson's disease in the years leading up to his death, an injury suffered on the set of \"Rio Lobo\" severely damaged one of his legs.\nHawks died on December 26, 1977, at the age of 81, from complications arising from a fall when he tripped over his dog at his home in Palm Springs, California. He had spent two weeks in the hospital recovering from his concussion when he asked to be taken home, dying a few days later. His death was attributed directly to \"arteriosclerotic vascular disease with stroke\". He was working with his last prot\u00e9g\u00e9e discovery at the time, Larraine Zax.\nStyle.\nHawks was a versatile director whose career includes comedies, dramas, gangster films, science fiction, film noir, and Westerns. Hawks's own functional definition of what constitutes a good film is characteristic of his no-nonsense style: \"three good scenes, and no bad ones.\" Hawks also defined a good director as \"someone who doesn't annoy you\". He described his style: \"I try to tell my story as simply as possible, with the camera at eye level. I just imagine the way the story should be told, and I do it.\" His style was very actor-focused, and he made it a point to take as few shots as possible, thereby preserving an inherent and natural humor for his comedic pieces.\nWhile Hawks was not sympathetic to feminism, he popularized the Hawksian woman archetype, a portrayal of women in stronger, less effeminate roles. Such an emphasis had never been done in the 1920s and therefore was seen to be a rarity and, according to Naomi Wise, has been cited as a prototype of the post-feminist movement. Another notable theme carried throughout his work included the relationship of morality and human interaction. In this sense, he tended to portray more dramatic elements of a concept or a plot in a humorous way.\nOrson Welles, in conversation with Peter Bogdanovich, compared Hawks with John Ford: \"Hawks is great prose; Ford is poetry.\" Hawks cited Ford as an influence: \"He was a good director when I started, and I copied him every time I could. It's just as if you were a writer, you would read Hemingway and Faulkner and John Dos Passos and Willa Cather.\" Despite Hawks's work in a variety of Hollywood genres, he still retained an independent sensibility. Film critic David Thomson wrote of Hawks: \"Far from the meek purveyor of Hollywood forms, he always chose to turn them upside down. \"To Have and Have Not\" and \"The Big Sleep\", ostensibly an adventure and a thriller, are really love stories. \"Rio Bravo\", apparently a Western \u2013 everyone wears a cowboy hat \u2013 is a comedy conversation piece. The ostensible comedies are shot through with exposed emotions, with the subtlest views of the sex war, and with a wry acknowledgment of the incompatibility of men and women.\" David Boxwell argues that the filmmaker's body of work \"has been accused of a historical and adolescent escapism, but Hawks's fans rejoice in his oeuvre's remarkable avoidance of Hollywood's religiosity, bathos, flag-waving, and sentimentality.\nWriting and producing.\nIn addition to his career as a film director, Howard Hawks either wrote or supervised the writing for most of his films. In some cases, he would rewrite parts of the script on set. Due to the Screen Writer's Guild's rule that the director and producer couldn't receive credit for writing, Hawks rarely received credit. Even though Sidney Howard received credit for writing \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939), the screenplay was actually written by a myriad of Hollywood screenwriters including, David O. Selznick, Ben Hecht, and Howard Hawks. Hawks was an uncredited contributor to many other screenplays such as \"Underworld\" (1927), \"Morocco\" (1930), \"Shanghai Express\" (1932), and \"Gunga Din\" (1939). Hawks also produced many of his own films, preferring not to work under major film studios, because it allowed him creative freedom in his writing, directing, and casting. Hawks would sometimes walk out on films that he wasn't producing himself. Hawks, however, never considered producing to come before his directing. For example, several of the film cards for his films show \"Directed and produced by Howard Hawks\" with \"produced\" underneath \"directed\" in much smaller font. Sometimes his films wouldn't credit any producer. Hawks discovered many well known film stars such as Paul Muni, George Raft, Ann Dvorak, Carole Lombard, Frances Farmer, Jane Russell, Montgomery Clift, Joanne Dru, Angie Dickinson, James Caan, and most famously, Lauren Bacall.\nAwards and recognition.\nIn 1962, Peter Bogdanovich suggested that the Museum of Modern Art do a retrospective on Howard Hawks, who was in the process of releasing \"Hatari!\" For marketing purposes, Paramount paid for part of the exhibition, which traveled to Paris and London. For the event, Bogdanovich prepared a monograph. As a result of the retrospective, a special edition of \"Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma\" was published, and Hawks was featured in his own issue of \"Movie\" magazine.\nIn 1996, Howard Hawks was voted No. 4 on \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s list of 50 greatest directors. In 2007, \"Total Film\" magazine ranked Hawks as No. 4 in its \"100 Greatest Film Directors Ever\" list. \"Bringing Up Baby\" (1938) was listed number 97 on the American Film Institute's AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies. On the AFI's AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs \"Bringing Up Baby\" was listed number 14, \"His Girl Friday\" (1940) was listed number 19 and \"Ball of Fire\" (1941) was listed number 92. In the 2012 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" polls of the greatest films ever made, six films directed by Hawks were in the critics' top 250 films: \"Rio Bravo\" (number 63), \"Bringing Up Baby\" (number 110), \"Only Angels Have Wings\" (number 154), \"His Girl Friday\" (number 171), \"The Big Sleep\" (number 202), and \"Red River\" (number 235). Six of his films currently hold a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. His films \"Ball of Fire\", \"The Big Sleep\", \"Bringing Up Baby\", \"His Girl Friday\", \"Only Angels Have Wings\", \"Red River\", \"Rio Bravo\", \"Scarface\", \"Sergeant York\", \"The Thing from Another World\", and \"Twentieth Century\" were deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and inducted into the National Film Registry. With eleven films, he ties with John Ford for directing the most films that are in the registry.\nFrom the film industry, he received three nominations for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures from the Directors Guild of America for \"Red River\" in 1949, \"The Big Sky\" in 1953, and \"Rio Bravo\" in 1960. He was inducted into the Online Film and Television Association's Hall of Fame for his directing in 2005. For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Howard Hawks has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1708 Vine Street. He was nominated for Academy Award for Best Director in 1942 for \"Sergeant York\", but he received his only Oscar in 1974 as an Honorary Award from the academy. He was cited as \"a giant of the American cinema whose pictures, taken as a whole, represent one of the most consistent, vivid, and varied bodies of work in world cinema\" and \"a master filmmaker whose creative efforts hold a distinguished place in world cinema.\"\nInfluence and legacy.\nIn the 1950s, Eugene Archer, a film fan, was planning on writing a book on important American film directors such as John Ford. However, after reading \"Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma\", Archer learned that the French film scene was more interested in Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks. Books were not written on Hawks until the 1960s, and a full biography on Hawks wasn't published until 1997, twenty years after his death. Film critic Andrew Sarris cited Howard Hawks as \"the least known and least appreciated Hollywood director of any stature\". According to professor of film studies Ian Brookes, Hawks is not as well known as other directors, because of his lack of association with a particular genre such as Ford with Westerns and Hitchcock with thrillers. Hawks worked across many genres including gangster, film noir, musical comedy, romantic comedy, screwball comedy, Western, aviation, and combat. Moreover, Hawks preferred not to associate with major studios during his film production. He worked for all major studios at least once on short-term contract, but many of his films were produced under his own name. The simplicity of his narratives and stories may also have contributed to his under-recognition. Commercially, his films were successful, but he received little critical acclaim except for one Academy Award nomination for Best Director for \"Sergeant York\" (he lost to John Ford for \"How Green Was My Valley\") and an Honorary Academy Award presented to him two years before his death.\nSome critics limit Hawks by his action films, describing Hawks as a director who produced films with a \"masculine bias\", however action scenes in Hawks's films were often left to second-unit directors, and Hawks actually preferred to work indoors. Howard Hawks's style is difficult to interpret because there is no recognizable relationship between his visual and narrative style as in the films of his contemporary directors. Because his camera style was derived more from his working method rather than anecdotal or visual realization, his camera work is unobtrusive, making his films appear to have little to no cinematographic style. Hawks's style can, rather, be characterized as improvisational and collaborative. Hawks's directorial style and the use of natural, conversational dialogue in his films are cited as major influences on many noted filmmakers, including Robert Altman John Carpenter, and Quentin Tarantino. His work is also admired by Peter Bogdanovich, Martin Scorsese, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Michael Mann, and Jacques Rivette. Andrew Sarris in his influential book of film criticism \"The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929\u20131968\" included Hawks in the \"pantheon\" of the 14 greatest film directors who had worked in the United States. Brian De Palma dedicated his version of \"Scarface\" to Hawks and Ben Hecht. Altman was influenced by the fast-paced dialogue of \"His Girl Friday\" in \"M*A*S*H\" and subsequent productions. Hawks was nicknamed \"The Gray Fox\" by members of the Hollywood community, thanks to his prematurely gray hair.\nHawks has been considered by some film critics to be an auteur both because of his recognizable style and frequent use of specific thematic elements, and because of his attention to all aspects of his films, not merely directing. Hawks was venerated by French critics associated with \"Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma\", who intellectualized his work in a way that Hawks himself found moderately amusing (his work was promoted in France by The Studio des Ursulines cinema). Although he was not at first taken seriously by British critics of the \"Sight &amp; Sound\" circle, other independent British writers, such as Robin Wood, admired his films. Wood named Hawks's \"Rio Bravo\" as his top film of all time. David Thomson writes that \"There was an absurdist in Hawks, and a Nabokovian delight in the game for its own sake. Thus, in a very important way, this seeming American may have been against the grain of his time and place. That may help explain why the films grow in wonder.\"\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
